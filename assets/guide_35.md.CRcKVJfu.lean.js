The history of Bushnell-Prairie City High School is also the history of these original component schools. Bushnell High School It is not known when the school system in Bushnell was started. A consolidation effort between the towns of Bushnell and Prairie City took place in the early 1950s. The effort was realized in 1952. A new school was developed and is now called Bushnell- Prairie City High School. BPCHS built a new building on the grounds where the original building once stood. Bushnell High School's mascot was the Braves, and the school's colors were blue and purple.http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/id50.html Prairie City High School The first school building in Prairie City was established in 1855, just one year after the town was platted. The town's growth was remarkable, reaching a population of 1,500 by 1860. By 1875 that number had settled to about 800. A learning \\"Academy\\" was established in 1857 for the Prairie City kids by a local church and was supported by the town's people. This idea soon went by the wayside and the school building was used for public school purposes. A high school curriculum was established in Prairie City by the late 19th century. Prairie City High School served the community for about six decades. It was at some point in the early 1950s that the communities of Bushnell and Prairie City decided to pool their educational resources. This effort was realized in 1952. It was then that Prairie City High School closed and the Bushnell-Prairie City School District was opened.http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/id418.html Even though the High School classes were relocated to Bushnell as a result of the Bushnell-Prairie City (B-PC) consolidation, the school remained as the Prairie City Elementary School grades 1 through 8 until 1962. Grades 7 & 8 then relocated to the B-PC Jr. High School (the former Bushnell High School bldg. in Bushnell). Grades 1 through 6 remained until the early 1970s.Marc Young, Summary of Events of Prairie City High School, Illinois High School Glory Days, Prairie City High School. Retrieved February 5, 2010. The original Prairie City High School building has been torn down. Prairie City High School's mascot was the Cobras, and its colors were blue and white. Future consolidation talks Beginning in late 2008 the Bushnell-Prairie City School District began discussing reorganization or consolidation with neighboring school districts. In the summer of 2009 a feasibility study was commissioned to investigate the possibilities of consolidation with neighboring Avon and Abingdon school districts. The results of the study were released in January 2010. The recommendations of the study included: consolidation of all three districts into one unit district, placement of the combined high school in the current Bushnell-Prairie City High/Middle School buildings, placement of the combined middle school in the current Abingdon High/Middle School, and keeping the current elementary buildings in place.Accessed February 5, 2010 Midwestern School Consultants, Dr. William Phillips, Dr. Scott Day, Dr. Leonard Bogle; Reorganization Feasibility Study for Avon/Abingdon/Bushnell-Prairie City Study; January, 2010 References External links * Bushnell-Prairie City High School * Bushnell-Prairie City Community Unit School District Category:Public high schools in Illinois Category:Schools in McDonough County, Illinois ","title":"Bushnell-Prairie City High School"},{"id":"26084963","text":"\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\" may refer to: Film and TV *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", with Y≈´ta Hiraoka *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", episode of Total Divas (season 4) Music Albums * It's a Beautiful Life (album), Freebass 2010 *It's a Beautiful Life, album by Mark Spiro 2012 Songs *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", chorus of \\"Beautiful Life\\" (Ace of Base song) *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", single by band The Mighty Wallop!, covered by 10,000 Maniacs on Music from the Motion Picture *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", single by Joel Feeney from Joel Feeney and the Western Front *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", single by Don McLean from Chain Lightning, Dominion and Greatest Hits ‚Äì Live *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", single by Kenny Rogers from Back to the Well, single charted at 23 in Canada *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", song by Jpop vocalist Hironobu Kageyama from Super Survivor *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", song by Shila Amzah from album 3 Suara, Shila Amzah discography *\\"It's a Beautiful Life\\", song by dobro player Jerry Douglas written Ehm and Thorny from Slide Rule 1992 See also *Beautiful Life (disambiguation) * It's a Wonderful Life (disambiguation) * Life Is Beautiful ","title":"It's a Beautiful Life"},{"id":"26084970","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 580, adopted unanimously on 30 December 1985, having heard representations from Lesotho and recalling Resolution 527 (1982), the Council condemned the recent attacks on the Kingdom of Lesotho by South Africa, resulting in loss of life and damage to property on 19 December, in which several South African refugees were murdered in Lesotho's capital Maseru by the South African Defence Force.

The unit was formed on 15 May 1944 and eventually comprised three squadrons equipped with Spitfire fighter aircraft. The wing's headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No. 11 Group on 30 July 1945. The wing was established to provide fighter protection for an Allied offensive from Darwin in northern Australia into the eastern Netherlands East Indies (NEI). This operation was effectively cancelled in June 1944, however, leaving No. 80 Wing without a clear mission. The unit remained at Darwin until it moved to Morotai in the NEI between December 1944 and March 1945. Due to the small number of Japanese aircraft remaining in this area the Wing's aircraft were mainly used in the ground attack role. From May 1945 to the end of the war two of No. 80 Wing's squadrons participated in the Borneo Campaign. History Darwin In early 1944 General George Kenney, the commander of the Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), adopted a goal of landing forces at Selaru Island in the eastern NEI and establishing a bomber base there. Accordingly, in early March, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, who led RAAF Command, presented Kenney with a proposal for the RAAF to contribute two fighter wings and several ancillary units to this operation, which at the time was scheduled for 15 June. One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and the other with Spitfires.Alexander (2006), p. 159 In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell, the RAAF's highest-scoring flying ace of the war, reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones. In a meeting between Jones and Caldwell, Jones stated that the wing would have the highest priority for supplies and equipment.Alexander (2006), pp. 159‚Äì160 No. 80 Wing was formed at Darwin, Northern Territory on 15 May 1944.Alexander (2006), p. 161 It initially comprised No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons, which were transferred from No. 1 Wing. Both of these squadrons had seen extensive combat over Europe and northern Australia and were based at Sattler Airfield near Darwin. The squadrons were equipped with Spitfire Vc aircraft at the time of the wing's establishment, but received superior Mark VIII Spitfires between June and August.Alexander (2006), pp. 162‚Äì163 General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6 June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No. 80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August.Alexander (2006), p. 163 The effective cancellation of the operation left No. 80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left with nothing to do other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, the commander of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia.Odgers (1968), pp. 246‚Äì247 During the same period No. 80 Wing's pilots observed that No. 1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.Alexander (2006), pp. 164‚Äì165 Morotai In mid-September Bostock gained the agreement of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No. 80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI as part of a redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA.Odgers (1968), p. 297 While this raised morale within No. 80 Wing, it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas. On 8 November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit he observed that it was likely that supply shortages would impede the wing's operations.Alexander (2006), p. 166 No. 80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9 December and No. 452 Squadron departed on 15 December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai that day, three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea.Alexander (2006), pp. 168‚Äì169 As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic, and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.Alexander (2006), pp. 172‚Äì173 Five No. 452 Squadron Spitfires in flight near Morotai during December 1944 The wing began flying night defence patrols shortly after No. 452 Squadron arrived at Morotai.Alexander (2006), p. 171 At the time Morotai was a major Allied base and had been attacked by Japanese aircraft on multiple occasions. During the night of 24 December a Spitfire shot down a Japanese bomber over the island. This proved to be one of the last Japanese raids on Morotai, and no further interceptions were made. The lack of aerial opposition meant that No. 80 Wing's aircraft were increasingly used to strafe Japanese positions near Morotai.Alexander (2006), p. 175 During January 1945 the wing flew 84 ground attack sorties, losing three Spitfires in the process.Odgers (1968), p. 384 The lack of opportunities for aerial combat disappointed No. 80 Wing's pilots and contributed to a decline in their morale.Odgers (1968), p. 388 No. 80 Wing completed its move to Morotai in March. No. 457 Squadron's Spitfires left Darwin on 6 February and arrived on the island two days later. Later that month No. 79 Squadron joined the wing at Morotai.Odgers (1968), p. 396 This squadron had previously operated Spitfires in New Guinea and nearby islands before withdrawing to Darwin in January 1945 to receive Mark VIII Spitfires. The final ship carrying No. 80 Wing personnel and equipment from Darwin arrived at Morotai in early March. Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes, who had been appointed No. 80 Wing's wing leader in October 1944, held temporary command of the unit for several days in late March while Caldwell made a trip to Manila.Alexander (2006), p. 178 On 31 March Wing Commander Glen Cooper assumed command from Caldwell, who had reached the end of his appointment and was disillusioned with how No. 80 Wing had been used.Alexander (2006), pp. 175‚Äì177, 180 Dissatisfaction with the tasks being undertaken by the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF), of which No. 80 Wing was part, led to the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\" in April 1945. On 19 April, Caldwell, Gibbes and six other senior 1TAF officers attempted to resign in protest against what they believed was the misuse of fighter aircraft in ground attack operations against isolated Japanese positions.Odgers (1968), pp. 443‚Äì444 While no action was taken against these officers, Caldwell and Gibbes were later court martialled for selling liquor. From May No. 80 Wing units participated in the Australian-led Borneo Campaign. No. 457 Squadron was attached to No. 81 Wing and deployed to Labuan on 18 June as part of the Operation Oboe Six landings in the Brunei Bay region. The squadron provided air defence and flew close air support sorties alongside No. 76 Squadron, and shot down a Japanese aircraft on 20 June.Odgers (1968), p. 472Waters (1995), p. 110 In April No. 452 Squadron was attached to No. 78 Wing and took part in the landing at Tarakan in May.Odgers (1968), p. 453 Delays in repairing Tarakan's airfield meant that it did not see any combat until 30 June. The squadron subsequently supported the landing at Balikpapan in July, and one of its Spitfires shot down a Japanese aircraft in the early hours of 24 July.Odgers (1968), pp. 487‚Äì489 During this period No. 79 Squadron remained at Morotai and continued to fly ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on the nearby island of Halmahera.Thomas (2009), pp. 86‚Äì87 On 30 July 1945 No. 80 Wing Headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No. 11 Group. While it was intended that the wing's three flying squadrons would come under the command of this group, in the event it only took operational control of No. 79 Squadron before the war ended.Odgers (1968), p. 478 A memorial plaque for No. 80 Wing was unveiled at the Australian War Memorial on 29 November 2013.

The site bills itself as a place \\"where many many many men come to play.\\" Rejected Super Bowl advertisement ManCrunch gained major publicity in January 2010 when it was revealed that CBS was considering a television advertisement the site had produced to air during Super Bowl XLIV. The ad featured a male Packers fan and a male Vikings fan reaching into the same bowl of chips at the same time, and after a brief pause, passionately kissing and dry humping each other, much to the surprise of the other man present. The advertisement was initially put on a waiting list before the network outright rejected it due to it violating CBS's broadcast standards and because CBS believed ManCrunch's did not have sufficient credit (ability to pay for the ad). ManCrunch accused CBS of discrimination saying, \\"If the ad showed a man and woman kissing it would have been accepted.\\" The New York Post concluded it was \\"no more racy than nearly any beer commercial not starring the Budweiser Clydesdales.\\"CBS Rejects Gay Themed Super Bowl Ad , Tracy Phillips, Fancast.com, January 29, 2010 The ad was accused of being a form of ambush marketing by analysts, who theorized that the company knew the advertisement would be rejected by CBS, thus drawing free publicity to the site without needing to pay the extremely high rates for advertising during the Super Bowl. In July 2015‚Äîafter data from Avid Life Media's sites (including ManCrunch)https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/ashley-madison- hack-leaking-a-email-addresses-puts-gay-lives-at-risk-around-the- world-10464546.html was hacked and leaked online‚Äîcomedy writer Kristen Bartlett wrote an essay for Someecards about her work in Television Standards & Practices. Bartlett wrote the report rejecting the ad, and shortly after sending the report, Avid Life Media published a press release, including her name, phone number and the confidential report, all of which led to her being branded \\"a homophobe\\" online. Bartlett wrote that the reason she rejected the ad's content was not because it contained two men kissing, but because it did so in a manner exploiting gay men: \\"The entire premise is how funny and weird it is that two guys would make out. How gross, right? .... Gay sex is reduced to a ploy for cheap laughs.\\" Bartlett also considered the ad submission to be a marketing ploy; noting the fact that the two men in the ad were wearing Packers and Vikings jerseys, she wrote that the jerseys appeared to be a safeguard that would guarantee the ad would be rejected. \\"In order to show NFL jerseys, clients have to spend a lot of money to obtain licensing. Now, I'm not saying that Avid Life didn't spend a fortune to use those jerseys. But I will say that they definitely didn't send me any releases.\\"  See also  * Homosocialization References External links *Official Web site Category:Online dating services of Canada Category:Gay men's websites ","title":"ManCrunch"},{"id":"26085305","text":"Vampyrocrossota is a genus of hydrozoans of the family Rhopalonematidae.Thuesen, E.V. 1993.

Life and work Born in 1844 in VƒÉlenii de Munte, PƒÉnculescu went to study abroad and graduated from the Zurich Science and Technology University, and then joined the 'Soci√©t√© des √âtablissements Eiffel' engineering company founded by Gustave Eiffel, recommended by famous Romanian poet Vasile Alecsandri. In 1878, PƒÉnculescu returned to Romania in order to design and build the railway line between Predeal and Bucharest, which he completed in less than a year, despite the five-year contract initially drafted; this is attributed to the truly innovative system for joining the metal girders together in the pre-assembly phase, away from the tracks' location which he devised. In 1879, Gustave Eiffel made a documented visit to PƒÉnculescu's house in VƒÉlenii de Munte, in what is today the Nicolae Iorga Memorial Museum,http://www.ghidinfoturism.ro/obiective_turistice/muntenia/judetul_prahova/valenii_de_munte/muzeul_memorial_nicolae_iorga/ where he was shown the technology used by PƒÉnculescu for the construction of the railway line. Eiffel himself documented PƒÉnculescu's contribution in his work titled 'Communication sur les travaux de la tour de 300 m' written in 1887.See The same technology was used by Eiffel in building the Eiffel Tower. Gheorghe PƒÉnculescu became the General Inspector of the CFR SA, the Romanian national train operator.  Recognition  The only significant research of this collaboration between Gheorghe PƒÉnculescu and Gustave Eiffel has been done by Prof. Eugen StƒÉnescu, Adjunct Director of the Museum of History and Archaeology in Prahova, Romania. StƒÉnescu went to Paris and researched Eiffel's archives, where he came across the document 'Communication sur les travaux de la tour de 300 m' mentioned above, which gives credit to PƒÉnculescu's innovation and its crucial role to the completion of the tower. On 15 September 2004, during an official ceremony, a local school from VƒÉlenii de Munte dating back from 1774 received the name 'The Gheorghe PƒÉnculescu School of Arts and Crafts' in recognition of the genius of the inventor born in their town.The Romanian text goes: 'In cadrul unei festivitati emotionante pe 15 Septembrie 2004, s-a instalat noua firma a scolii, purtand numele unei personalitati a locului dar cu recunoastere internationala prin inventiile sale in domeniul rezistentei materialelor, inovatiei aplicate in constructia caii ferate Ploiesti ‚Äì Predeal si a contributiei sale, alaturi de ing.

Morse. The film is also known as Adventures of Danny Boy (American TV title). Plot Danny Boy is a well trained German shepherd dog that has been in service with the U.S. Marines, but which is now returned to his previous owner, young Jimmy Bailey. Jimmy discovers that his best friend has changed while away, and doesn't recognize him anymore. Jimmy's ex-marine friend Joe Cameron tells him to be patient and spend a lot of time with the dog, take it to all the familiar places they used to go to, and play the same games as they used to. Soon Danny Boy starts to become his old self, but the mean next door neighbor, Frank \\"Grumpy\\" Andrews, claims that the dog is a danger to public safety, being a former war dog. When Jimmy breaks the neighbor's window by accident while playing baseball, the neighbor threatens to call the police. Jimmy vows to pay for the repair, and he and the other boys start vending lemonade in the street to raise the money. Meanwhile, a nearby farmer sees the beautiful dog and tells Andrews that he wants it. Without scruples, Andrews helps the farmer to steal the dog in the night, and the new \\"owner\\" starts abusing Danny Boy to make him obedient. Danny Boy runs away from the farmer and returns to Jimmy, bruised and battered. The dog thief is disclosed when Danny Boy attacks the farmer upon his return to the street. Andrews tries to shoot the dog, and gets bitten. The police are called to the scene, but Jimmy escapes with his dog before they arrive. Joe persuades Jimmy to turn the dog in to the police, fully convinced that the police will understand the situation and let the dog go. But it turns out that Danny Boy is deemed unfit to remain in society and is to be put down by being executed in a gas chamber. Joe tries to help by explaining that Danny Boy is a decorated military dog that has proved very useful. He begs that the dog at least get a worthy ending by firing squad, rather than die like a common criminal. Joe is given the assignment to shoot Danny Boy and takes him away in his truck. Jimmy gets to say goodbye to the dog in front of the others, and then Joe takes him into the forest to kill him. As it turns out, Danny Boy rescues a small boy from being hit by a passing train, by pulling him off the tracks at the last second. Meanwhile, Jimmy has found the whip and Danny Boy's leash in the farmer's barn, proving that he had abused the dog extensively. The decision to put down Danny Boy is revoked, and the farmer and Andrews are both arrested for torturing the animal. Jimmy is then reunited with his beloved dog.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/72255/Danny-Boy/  Cast  *Robert Buzz Henry as Jimmy Bailey *Ralph Lewis as Joe Cameron *Sybil Merritt as Margie Bailey, Jimmy's Sister *Helen Brown as Mrs. Bailey, Jimmy's Mom *Walter Soderling as Frank 'Grumpy' Andrews *Joseph Granby as Lafe Dunkell the Orange Man *Mickey McGuire as Pudgie, Camper's Club *Bobby Valentine as Rinky, Camper's Club *Charles Bates as Louie, Camper's Club *Larry Dixon as Tuffy, Camper's Club *Eve March as Ruthie Johnson, Jackie's Mom *Ace the Wonder Dog as Danny Boy *Richard Kipling as Judge Carter *James Metcalfe *Tay Dunn as Ed Johnson *Pat Gleason as Soldier *Eric Younger as Jackie Johnson *Myron Wilton as Hal  External links  * References Category:1946 films Category:1940s adventure drama films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Producers Releasing Corporation films Category:Films about dogs Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps Category:American drama films Category:1946 drama films ","title":"Danny Boy (1946 film)"},{"id":"26085505","text":"Clarence E.

It replaced a small steam locomotive. It is of the type designated as a 45-ton, although the actual weight may be different from that. It is powered by two Cummins HBI-600 six-cylinder diesel prime movers, each of which drives a generator which, in turn, drives a single electric traction motor, one on each truck. The second axle on each truck is driven by a side rod. The Delta Valley and Southern Railway, \\"DVS\\", in 1996 operated two miles of track from Delpro to Elkins, Arkansas, carrying about 600 cars a year. The line originally operated over 18.1 miles of track from Delpro to Tyronza, but was cut back in 1947. It was part of the St. Louis ‚Äì San Francisco Railway (Frisco) for most of its life. DV&S; 50 was the only locomotive used on the railroad from 1954 until sold to Edwin Kessler. Burlington Northern Santa Fe accepted payment for delivery to Oklahoma City, but attempted to auctioned it there over a delivery dispute on May 6, 2009. Bidding closed May 26 without a winner. The locomotive was last seen running in Omaha, Nebraska on November 5, 2009. It is not known where the locomotive is now. The locomotive was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Delta Valley & Southern Railway Locomotive #50. Nomenclature General Electric made a wide variety of small diesel electric locomotives for industrial and railroad use. These included: *44 ton. These were specifically designed to weigh less than 90,000 pounds and therefore could be operated by a single engineer, without a fireman, under the labor contracts of the time. They had two Caterpillar diesels, two four-wheel trucks, four traction motors, 400 horsepower, top speed of 35 mph, minimum radius of 125 feet, and were designed for use on branch lines of major railroads. *45 ton. These were designed for light industrial use. They had two Cummins diesels, two four-wheel trucks, one traction motor per truck, 300 horsepower, top speed of 20 mph, minimum radius of 50 feet, and were designed for industrial use with tight curves and clearances. *50 ton. These were a two-axle (four-wheel) configuration with a traction motor on each of the two axles. They had the same prime movers as the 45 ton, but a much lower and narrower body, designed to operate in steel mills and other very tight places at a top speed of 15 mph. The extra weight was ballast.

Lohan was a captain of a group of Whiteboys in the Moylough area of County Galway, responsible for rural unrest and violence. They were opposed by Charles O'Rourke (Moylough), a landlord based in Moylough, who arrested suspected members and engaged them in pitched battles. An ambush was planned by the Whiteboys, upon learning of his route on a given night. However, a young landowner named Brown was travelling the same road that night, and was killed in the belief that he was O'Rourke. He was well regarded by local people and the Whiteboys. O'Rourke arrested several men, and upon the information of an informer, Seamus a'Burca, Lohan was sentenced to death for the crime. Prior to sentencing, Lohan was asked if there were any gentleman of the jury who could give him a character recommendation. Lohan pointed out a Mr. Blake of Garbally. On being asked what he had to say about Lohan, Blake replied, I never saw two dogs fighting, my lord, but Lohan would be the third. Lohan was taken from Galway jail to be hanged, as was custom, at his own door. He sat on his coffin on a cart on the way. At Turloughmore he recognised a friend called O'Shaughnessy and threw him his hat, exclaiming I will you my old hat. This was afterwards called Lohan's Last Will and Testament. Lohan was hanged in front of a crowd of hundreds at Cooloo hill, in sight of his house. Two of his sisters were present, and it was stated that they were never in their right mind afterwards. The local historian, Martin Finnerty, recorded that his grandmother witnessed the event.

ZSF works to improve education in some of the poorest areas of Zambia. History The groundwork for ZSF began in 1998 through the efforts of founder Peggy Rogers. Rogers had seen the need for more educational opportunities in Zambia and began efforts to raise money to fund scholarship for high school students and high school graduates willing to attend a teachers college and begin teaching in rural schools. As funding allowed, more and more students were served. In the first ten years of operation, more than 1,000 high school and college students received scholarships and over 1,000 tons of books have been shipped from the United States to Zambian schools. A tenth anniversary celebration in November 2009 featured a concert by country singer Emmylou Harris and a visit from the Zambian Ambassador to the United States, Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika. Background The government of the Republic of Zambia had to provide a free public education through the 8th grade. However, there are not enough available teachers for some rural areas. High schools, 9-12, are typically boarding schools requiring tuition. Teachers Colleges are two year programs, also typically boarding schools. Governance and operations Peggy Rogers of Brigham City, Utah is the President. Brad McLaws of Park City, Utah is the Vice President. ZSF is governed by a Board of Directors. Officers and volunteers are not paid for their services and when traveling to Zambia for oversight, pay their own travel costs. The Fund employs two part-time coordinators on the ground in Zambia.

It was enacted by the Parliament of South Africa, signed by Acting President Thabo Mbeki on 17 March 1999, and came into force two days later. It was signed and came into force simultaneously with the Fourth Amendment; the two amendments were separated because the Fourth involved provincial matters and had to be passed by the National Council of Provinces while the Fifth did not.  Provisions  The Act made two technical modifications to the Constitution. The first was to clarify that, when the term of the National Assembly is due to expire, the President may issue the proclamation calling an election either before or after the term actually expires. The Fourth Amendment made the same change for elections to provincial legislatures. The second was to allow that the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the Financial and Fiscal Commission need not necessarily be permanent members of the commission.

History  The original survey of Township number 7 in Range 2 West in the province of Manitoba was conducted by J. Doupe in 1871 and completed by J.A. Snow in 1872, who stated that the area contained level prairie with many marshes. The survey of Township number 7 Range 1 West took slightly longer. It commenced in 1871 with surveyors M. Hart, J. Doupe, and J.A. Snow in 1872 and completed in 1886 by R.C. McPhillips. These men recorded the area as being open prairie with occasional low spots.

Its inversion is the augmented third, and its enharmonic equivalent is the perfect fifth.  Wolf fifth  A severely dissonant diminished sixth is observed when the instrument is tuned using a Pythagorean or a meantone temperament tuning system. Typically, this is the interval between G and E. Since it seems to howl like a wolf (because of the beating), and since it is meant to be the enharmonic equivalent to a fifth, this interval is called the wolf fifth.

It occurs when a player slam dunks the ball with sufficient force to shatter the tempered safety glass of the backboard. The stunt has caused games to be canceled or delayed, incurring a foul for the offending player, serious injuries to occur and expensive costs of cleanup and replacement. Shattering a backboard is extremely dangerous, sending various small pieces of the backboard glass flying over the players, sideline press personnel, referees, and fans. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), shattering a backboard during a game is penalized with a \\"non-unsportsmanlike\\" technical foul and a possible fine towards the player. The player may not be ejected, nor shall the foul count towards a player's total towards either ejection or suspension. Backboard shattering has altered the game in many different ways. In 1967, the dunk was banned in high school and college basketball. The rule-makers claimed the dunk was outlawed to prevent injury and equipment damage. After multiple issues with the new rule, nine years later they allowed the slam dunk to be legal again due to the invention of the breakaway rim. The NBA began using them after Darryl Dawkins shattered two backboards with his slam dunks during the 1979‚Äì80 season. Throughout the history of basketball there have always been athletes with the size and strength to slam dunk the ball through the rim. However, the first NBA player to shatter a backboard, Chuck Connors (who would become far more famous as an actor), did not do so with a dunk. When playing for the Boston Celtics in 1946, Connors took a set shot during pregame warmups, hitting the front of the rim. Because an arena worker had failed to place a protective piece between the rim and backboard, the backboard shattered. All-star power forward Gus Johnson of the Baltimore Bullets became famous as a backboard breaker in the NBA, shattering three during his career in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the American Basketball Association (ABA), Charlie Hentz shattered two backboards in the same game on November 6, 1970, resulting in the game being cancelled. Darryl Dawkins and Shaquille \\"Shaq\\" O'Neal became famous for shattering backboards; the former is credited for being the person to cause NBA to introduce breakaway rims, while the latter slam dunked hard enough that he broke the supports holding two backboards during games against the New Jersey Nets and the Phoenix Suns during the 1992‚Äì93 NBA season. Following the 1992‚Äì93 season, the NBA increased steel brace strength and increased stability of the backboard to prevent the hoop from falling down. A technical foul for backboard shattering was also introduced.

Early life Bliss was born in St. Louis, Missouri on August 5, 1875, the son of William Henry Bliss (1844‚Äì1932), a U.S. Attorney, and Anna Louisa Woods Bliss (b. 1850) and the brother of Annie Louise Bliss Warren (1878‚Äì1964). When his father remarried in 1894, he became the stepson of Anna Dorinda Blaksley Barnes Bliss (1851‚Äì1935) and the stepbrother of Cora (Kora) Fanny Barnes (1858‚Äì1911) and Mildred Barnes (1879‚Äì1969). He attended J. P. Hopkinson's Private School in Boston (1894‚Äì1895) and received his B.A. in 1900 from Harvard College, where he was a member of the Owl Club (Harvard). Bliss married Mildred Barnes in 1908. Diplomatic career After graduating from college, Bliss went to work in Puerto Rico, first in the office of the secretary of the U.S. civil government there, then as private secretary to the governor of Puerto Rico (1901‚Äì1903). He passed the State Department qualifying examination in 1903 and entered diplomatic Foreign Service. As a career diplomat and Republican, Bliss served as U.S. consul in Venice (1903); second secretary to the U.S. embassy in St. Petersburg (1904‚Äì1907); secretary of the legation in Brussels (1907‚Äì1909); secretary of the legation in Buenos Aires (1909‚Äì1912); secretary of the United States embassy in Paris (1912‚Äì1916); and counselor of the embassy in Paris (1916‚Äì1919). In 1908 he was a delegate to the international conference to consider revision of the arms and ammunition regulations of the Brussels Conference Act of 1890, and in 1918 he was temporarily assigned to serve as charg√© d'affaires at the U.S. legation in The Hague. Robert Bliss and his wife, Mildred, were living in Paris when World War I broke out. They helped found the American Field Ambulance Service (later the American Field Service) in France in 1914, to which they donated an entire section of 23 ambulances and three staff cars. They also opened and equipped a central depot in Paris, the \\"Service de Distribution Am√©ricaine,\\" for the distribution of medical and surgical supplies and clothing. The Blisses' social circle in Paris included Edith Wharton, Walter Gay, and Royall Tyler. In 1920 Bliss became chief of the Division of Western European Affairs at the State Department in Washington, and was Third Assistant Secretary of State (1921‚Äì1923) before becoming U.S. Envoy to Sweden (1923-1927) and U.S. Ambassador to Argentina (1927-1933), after which he retired from the Foreign Service. War service Bliss returned to the State Department following the entry of the U.S. into World War II, as a consultant (1942‚Äì1943), special assistant to U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1944), and consultant to Secretary of State Edward Stettinius (1944‚Äì1945). Robert Bliss was instrumental in arranging for a series of important diplomatic meetings to take place at Dumbarton Oaks (see below) in the late summer and early fall of 1944. Known as the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, these meetings hosted delegations from China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The delegates deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world, and their outcome was the United Nations Charter that was adopted in San Francisco in 1945. Bliss retired a second time from government work in November 1945. Art collecting and Dumbarton Oaks Bliss' former home, Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C. While living in Paris (1912‚Äì1919), the Blisses had become reacquainted with Mildred Bliss's childhood friend, the American historian and art connoisseur Royall Tyler. Tyler introduced the Blisses to important Parisian art dealers and nurtured their growing interest as art collectors, especially of Byzantine and pre- Columbian artworks. Gale Biography In Context. Robert Bliss was particularly enamored of pre-Columbian art, stating that when Tyler introduced him to it in a Parisian shop in 1912, \\"the collector's microbe took root in ... very fertile soil.\\" In 1920 the Blisses purchased their home, Dumbarton Oaks. They set about renovating and enlarging the house, adding to the grounds, and building a series of terraced gardens on the 54-acre estate. The Blisses lived abroad (1923‚Äì1933) for many of the years in which this work was carried out, though they continued to supervise it closely. They also continued to build their art collection, and upon retiring in 1933 to Dumbarton Oaks they began to lay the groundwork for a museum and research institute. In 1935, Robert Bliss traveled through the highlands and tropics of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras to see Maya ruins with Frederic C. Walcott (1869‚Äì1949), a trustee of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In 1940, the Blisses cofounded the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, which they endowed and gave to Harvard University. After giving Dumbarton Oaks to Harvard, the Blisses resided at 1537 28th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Robert Bliss's collection of pre-Columbian art, which had been exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. between 1947 and 1962, was installed in 1963 at Dumbarton Oaks in a new wing designed by Philip Johnson. Later life Robert Bliss was involved with many cultural and civic organizations. He served as honorary president and trustee of the American Federation of Arts; president of the American Foreign Service Association; vice-chairman of the Smithsonian Art Commission; vice-chairman of the board of the National Trust for Historic Preservation; director and first vice-president of the Washington Criminal Justice Association; member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science; and member of the Harvard Board of Overseers. He was trustee of the American Museum of Natural History, New York; trustee and executive committee member of the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C.; trustee of Nelson Rockefeller's Museum of Primitive Art, New York; trustee of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art; and member of the Advisory Committee on Art of the State Department's Division of Cultural Relations and the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. He received honorary Doctor of Law degrees from the University of Missouri (1933); Syracuse University (1934); and Harvard University (1951). Robert Bliss was one of five retired diplomats who co- signed a 1954 letter protesting U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy's attacks on the Foreign Service. The Blisses had no children. Robert Woods Bliss died at the age of 86 in Washington, D.C. on April 19, 1962. Publications He wrote Indigenous Art of the Americas (1947; reissued as Pre-Columbian Art in 1957).

These estates were very large properties and existed from the time of the Roman Dictator of the Roman Republic, Lucius Cornelius Sulla (c. 138 BC-78 BC). When her father died in 221, her mother was briefly married to the Roman Emperor Elagabalus. By the end of 221, Elagabalus had ended their marriage by divorcing her mother. When Annia Aurelia Faustina died, Pomponia Ummidia inherited her mother‚Äôs estate and the fortune of her mother. By this means, she became a very wealthy heiress. According to the inscriptions found on the estate, Pomponia Ummidia is named as the heiress of the estate, inheriting the estate from her parents. These inscriptions reveal that Pomponia Ummidia married a Greek Politician called Flavius Antiochianus. Flavius Antiochianus was an active politician in the reigns of the four above mentioned Roman Emperors. She spent her time between Rome and Pisidia. According to the inscriptions, Pomponia Ummidia appears to have been a virtuous person in character. It is unknown whether Pomponia Ummidia bore any of Flavius Antiochianus' children.

Family Calvisius was probably the son of Gaius Calvisius Sabinus, consul in 4 BC, and grandson of Gaius Calvisius Sabinus, consul in 39 BC. His wife, Cornelia, may have been the sister of Cornelius Lentulus, Calvisius' colleague in the consulship.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 689 (\\"Calvisius Sabinus\\", No. 3). Career Calvisius is first heard of when he and Cornelius were named consules ordinarii for AD 26. This was the year in which Tiberius left Rome for Campania, never to return. On the Kalends of July, the consuls were replaced by Quintus Junius Blaesus and Lucius Antistius Vetus.Tacitus, Annales, iv. 46. Tiberius' removal from Rome may have been influenced by his advisor Sejanus, who assumed power in the emperor's absence. Sejanus fell from power and was executed the year of his own consulship, AD 31. The following year, Calvisius and three other men of consular rank were accused of maiestas. One of the informers, a tribune of a city cohort by the name of Celsus, gave testimony that exculpated Calvisius and Appius Junius Silanus, consul in AD 28. Tiberius deferred action against the other two, Gaius Annius Pollio and Mamercus Aemilius Scaurus.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 9.Rutledge, Imperial Inquisitions, online. pp. 98, 230.Seager, Tiberius online. p. 192. During the reign of Caligula, Calvisius was appointed governor of Pannonia, and given the command of two legions. The emperor recalled the governor in AD 39, suspecting Calvisius and his wife of plotting against him, and brought charges against both. Cornelia was accused of entering the camp at night dressed as a soldier, interfering with the guard, and committing adultery in the general's headquarters. As their condemnation was certain, they put an end to their own lives before the trial could begin.Tacitus, Historiae, i. 48.Cassius Dio, Roman History, lix. 18.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy, p. 298 (note 120).Barrett, Agrippina, online. p. 60.

His father Carsten Tank (1766‚Äì1832) had been Minister of Finance on the governing council in Norway in 1814. His mother, Cathrine von Cappelen Tank (1772‚Äì1837) was the daughter of Diderich von Cappelen, a wealthy land-owner and ship owner. The manor house at the family estate, R√∏d Herreg√•rd, is now open to the public and operated by √òstfold Museum (√òstfold museene) Tank was educated in various European universities. In 1813 Tank was sent to a school in Oslo and in 1818 to a Moravian School in England. In 1834, he moved to Christiansfeld, Denmark to live at the Moravian Church colony which dated from 1773. Personal life His first wife, Marianne Dorothea Frueauf (1804‚Äì1844) was born in Grosshennersdorf near Herrnhut in Saxony. Otto Tank and Marianne Frueauf were married in Herrnhut during 1838. Their daughter Marianna Fredericka was born in Suriname in 1843 and her mother died the following year. In 1849, Otto Tank married Caroline Louise Albertina van der Meulen (1803‚Äì1891) who had been born in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Missionary Rank was disinherited after his first marriage and his conversion to the Moravian faith. Immigration  In 1850 the family migrated to the United States. Tank became acquainted with a Norwegian Moravian minister, Andreas Iverson. Tank purchased a tract of nearly 1,000 acres on the west bank of the Fox River at Fort Howard. Tank also acquired a fur trader‚Äôs cabin and rebuilt it as the historic Tank Cottage. He planned to establish a communal society. However Tank refused to grant title to land or adhere to the governing body of the Moravian Church. Personal differences soon arose between Tank and Reverend Iverson over leadership and the religious community elected to settle at Ephraim, Wisconsin. Tank also planned a canal between Green Bay and Prairie du Chien, this was before the railroad became preferred transportation. Tank Cottage in Green Bay Tank Cottage Tank Cottage was located on the west bank of the Fox River. It is reported to be the oldest existing house in Wisconsin.

Krieger's artistic work spans a broad field from contemporary classical composition and free improvisation to experimental fusion with electronic music, rock, metal and noise. His special interest lies in the exploration of the physical fringes between acoustic and electronic produced sounds. In his music and with his instrument, the saxophone, he developed an original style of playing he calls \\"acoustic electronics\\". Acoustic electronics is about using sounds that appear to be electronic but are actually produced on acoustic instruments. His probably best known experimental project with acoustic electronics is the transcription of Lou Reed's guitar feedback opus Metal Machine Music, which he rearranged for chamber orchestra.http://music.calarts.edu/faculty/ulrich- kriegerhttp://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6690-lou-reed/ In his works for saxophone Krieger uses extended instrumental techniques, microsounds, electronic manipulation, and saxophone-controlled feedbacks.http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=935590http://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=artistdetail&id;=3380 He defies stylistic boundaries, and the sonic result of this approach, as the Los Angeles Times critic Ann Powers describes it, \\"ranges wide as he seeks the spots where noise and beauty meet\\".http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/10/lou-reed-and-ul.html Career Early career (New Music and dissociation) Krieger studied classical saxophone, composition, electronic music and musicology at the Manhattan School of Music (New York), the Universit√§t der K√ºnste (Berlin) and the Freie Universit√§t (Berlin). He further pursued independent studies and research in the didjeridu and Australian Aboriginal music and culture.http://www.positionen.net/inhalt/inh_12.html In his early years he studied in depth the contemporary music of the European post-war avant-garde and won related prices and residencies.http://www.moderecords.com/profiles/ulrichkrieger.html Later he started to distinguish himself from the established New Music scene which in a 2007 interview he called \\"in a phase of mannerism and in a crisis\\".http://metropolis.free-jazz.net/a-musician-for-the-new-society/artist- portraits/ American music Since the late 1980s he became more and more interested in American music and its different approaches (chance music, process music, just intonation, multi-stylistic, minimalism, drone). In 1991 he moved to New York. In the 'Cage of Saxophones' series Krieger recorded the complete saxophone and any-instrument works of John Cage for Mode Records.Mode Records (2006).

A long term collaboration connects him with drone pioneer Phill Niblock, who wrote several pieces for him. He performs on Niblock releases like YPGTPN or Touch Food.http://touchshop.org/product_info.php?products_id=115 Krieger worked intensively on minimalist music, which he explored on his two 'Walls of Sound' releases. The first one focuses on drone music (Cage, Tenney, Niblock), while the second focuses on pattern music (Reich, Glass, Riley).Pritchett, James (1997).

Booklet Text from Ulrich Krieger. A subject that can be found throughout his work is what he calls static music, which explores the microcosms of sound beyond semantic, narrative or dramatic gesture. It consists of elements like long tones and drones, repetition and layers of sustained pitches. The result is an aural sculpture, an intense physical experience with the whole body, a physics and physical approach to the phenomenon of Sounds that are continuous and three-dimensional.Ingvar Loco Nordin (03/2006). Sono Loco Record Review of Ulrich Krieger's Walls of Sound II. The same elements can be found in noise and metal music, styles Krieger includes in his newer experimental projects. Electronic Music / Noise and Silent Music In the early 1990s he started working on a more electronic approach. He began developing an original amplification for the saxophone and various live-electronic signal processing set-ups. In the electronic experimental field he collaborated with rock, noise and ambient artists like Karkowski, Merzbow, Koener, Toeplitz. He also worked with the Berlin ensemble \\"zeitkratzer\\" for which he transcribed Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music. The original LP consists of one hour of guitar feedback noise. Although considered impossible Krieger scored the piece for amplified acoustic instruments, creating an orchestral work that had a new sound: classical chamber music instruments that sounded like electronic music.Wolfgang von Schweinitz, Ulrich Krieger, Randy Gloss, Ajay Kapur & Mark Robson Join CalArts Faculty. California Chronicle (10/28/2007). This arrangement has since then only been performed by the Great Learning Orchestra, Stockholm.http://home.swipnet.se/sonoloco24/glo/mmm.html Around the same time he started working with the 'silent music' composers, specially of the Wandelweiser group such as Malfatti, Beuger, and Pisaro.http://erstwords.blogspot.com/2009/09/wandelweiser.html Recent projects The basic pattern of long tones and drones, which he worked on his walls of sound releases, is still a matter of exploration in his recent, more experimental and improvising formations. More recently he intensified his acoustic electronics saxophone approach in diverse experimental band projects. Text of Light is a 2001 founded formation with Lee Ranaldo and Alan Licht, performing along with films of experimental film maker Stan Brakhage (1933‚Äì2003).http://www.sonicurbs.com/textoflight/pag/ Metal Machine Trio began in 2008 together with Lou Reed and Sarth Calhoun as an experimental free rock project.http://www.loureed.com/metalmachinetrio/ In September 2007 he moved to California, where he is professor for composition and experimental sound practice at the California Institute of the Arts.

He was an heir of the noble families of Montmorency and of Laval, styled Marquis de Laval then Prince de Montmorency- Laval before succeeding to his father's titles in 1817. He was additionally created a grandee of Spain and Duke of San Fernando Luis. Adrien de Montmorency-Laval was a French army officer, before serving as French foreign minister and as an ambassador during the Bourbon Restoration.  Early years  His father was Lieutenant-General Anne-Alexandre de Montmorency, 2nd Duc de Laval, and his mother was Marie-Louise de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1750‚Äì1829).Dictionnaire de la Noblesse, 1824 Born in 1768 while his formidable great-grandfather, Marshal Guy-Andr√©-Pierre de Montmorency, the 1st duke was alive, Adrien was sent to be raised under the tuition of his uncle Cardinal Louis-Joseph de Montmorency-Laval, Prince-Bishop of Metz and Grand Almoner of France in preparation for taking holy orders. Shortly after starting at the seminary of the Saint-Sulpice in Paris, his elder brother Guy de Montmorency, marquis de Laval, died unexpectedly in 1786; he had married Pauline-Ren√©e-Sophie de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson in 1784. His brother's death, prompted him to leave church training and participate in court life at Versailles. Montmorency-Laval joined the French army, being commissioned in the Alsace Cavalry Regiment, commanded by Charles, vicomte de Noailles (later duc de Mouchy) where he served alongside Marc-Ren√© de Voyer de Paulmy, marquis d'Argenson (1771‚Äì1842), his brother-in-law and lifelong friend. arms Marriage and children  On 14 May 1788, he married his second cousin (their great-grandfather was Anne-Jacques de Bullion, marquis de Fervacques, Governor of Marne),www.bnf.fr Bonne-Charlotte-Ren√©e-Ad√©la√Øde de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1773‚Äì1840), daughter of Anne-Charles-Sigismond, duc de Piney-Luxembourg (1737‚Äì1803) and head of the senior branch of the Montmorencys, by his wife Madeleine-Suzanne-Ad√©la√Øde de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson. The Duke and his wife had three children: * Guy-Anne-Marie-Louis-Henri-Adalric, prince de Laval (1796‚Äì1819), Huntmaster of Morbihan; * Charlotte-Ad√©la√Øde (1798‚Äì1872), 2nd Duchess of San Fernando Luis, who married in 1817, Gustave de L√©vis, marquis de Mirepoix: descendants include the historian, Antoine de L√©vis-Mirepoix; * Marguerite-Emmanuelle-Pauline (1811‚Äì1861) married Aim√©, marquis de Couronnel: ancestors of the Rar√©court family. Through his wife's family (the Colignys) their descendants inherited great wealth, as both her elder brothers died childless and in 1791 her younger sister Marie-Madeleine married Miguel Caetano √Ålvares Pereira de Melo, 5th Duque de Cadaval, emigrating to Portugal. Diplomatic career  Upon the outbreak of the French Revolution, after locating remaining family members in Paris, Adrien de Laval fled to England. As a French √©migr√© in London, the marquis became friendly with the Prince of Wales and his circle. During the revolutionary wars his father appointed him as aide-de-camp and despatched him to Italy as a captain in the Montmorency Regiment being stationed at Rome. After the ban on √©migr√©s was lifted in 1800 he returned to France. Adrien de Laval was one of the first to congratulate Louis XVIII at Calais in 1814, and the king promoted him mar√©chal de camp (major-general) and bestowed on him the style of Prince de Montmorency-Laval; he succeeded to his father's dukedom in 1817. On 15 August 1814, he was appointed French ambassador to Spain. There he came into conflict with Ceballos. But on receiving news of the return of Napoleon from Elba, a reconciliation was effected and Montmorency-Laval agreed to stay in Madrid, contrary to instructions from the French government. He successfully managed the somewhat tense relations between the Spanish Borb√≥ns and the newly restored French Bourbons, being honoured in 1815 as a knight of the Golden Fleece and made Duke of San Fernando Luis with the rank of grandee. His next ambassadorial posting was to Rome, where he arrived just before the end of Pius VII's reign and was present during the conclave for the election of his successor as pope; he supported the efforts of Austria in favour of Cardinal Castiglioni's candidacy. However, Cardinal Annibale della Genga was elected as Leo XII. On 20 March 1828, the Duc de Laval was appointed French ambassador to Austria. His name was also mooted as a candidate to be king of Greece, but he twice refused King Charles X's proposals. He was then posted as Ambassador to the Court of St James's, returning to Paris just before Charles X's exile. At Talleyrand's request, he dealt with unpleasant issues in London caused by his relatives, Louis, duc de Valen√ßay and his father Edmond, duca di Dino, who had become addicted to gambling. Declining to swear allegiance to King Louis- Philippe, the Duke and Duchess retired to the chateau de Montigny, where they received visitors, including Talleyrand. The Duke died on 16 June 1837 and, having been predeceased by his son at Naples in 1819, his youngest brother Eug√®ne succeeded to his French titles before they became extinct, whereas his Spanish ducado and grandeza devolved upon his elder daughter and her descendants.

Design and development Castoldi based the design of the M.67, (a single-seat, low-wing, monoplane, twin-float floatplane), on that of the earlier Macchi M.39, which had competed for Italy in the 1926 and 1927 Schneider Trophy races, following the M.39s layout but strengthened to accommodate the 18-cylinder, , Isotta- Fraschini Asso 1000(\\"Ace\\") 1000 W-18 engine, a much bigger and more powerful engine than the Fiat AS.2 V12 fitted to the M.39. The M.67 carried fuel in its floats; the powerful engine drove a three-bladed propeller which created a large amount of torque. To provide extra flotation allowing smaller floats, lighter structure and less drag, fuel was carried in integral tanks built into the floats. To counter the high torque from the propeller, more fuel was carried in one float than the other, reducing swing on take-off dramatically due to reduced asymmetric hydro-dynamic drag, but also causing high out of trim forces in roll when airborne.Va≈°iƒçek 2002, p. 34. Although the Italian public expressed a great deal of concern that the Asso 1000 engine was not ready for Schneider Trophy competition‚ÄîIsotta-Fraschini built 27 of them for the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, but some exploded during testing‚Äîthe Italian Air Minister, Italo Balbo (1896‚Äì1940), believed that the M.67 had the best chance of winning the race and selected it to represent Italy. Macchi built three M.67s. Operational history thumb The M.67s underwent testing on Lake Garda in northern Italy. In August 1929 Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) Captain Giuseppe Motta was killed when his M.67 suddenly dived into the lake during a test flight in which he reached 583 kilometers per hour (362 miles per hour). Italy asked the 1929 races hosts, the British Royal Aero Club, to postpone the race to allow Italy to correct the flaws in the M.67 and Asso 1000 engine, but the British refused. The Italians decided to enter the two surviving M.67s in the race despite the risk to their pilots, Balbo announcing that \\"the Italian team is going to England merely to perform a gesture of chivalrous sportsmanship.\\"Va≈°iƒçek 2002, p. 35. Italy also entered a Macchi M.52R floatplane in the race. Italys three entrants in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race. The two M.67s are at left and center; the Macchi M.52R, which took second place, is at right.The race took place at Calshot Spit in the United Kingdom and began on 7 September 1929, with Lieutenants Remo Cadringher and Giovanni Monti flying the two M.67s. Cadringhers M.67 began the race with an impressive burst of speed, but skidded in the first turn as its cockpit filled with blinding, choking smoke, and fumes; Cadringher went into a high-speed spin, pulled out of it over land, then completed one lap at an average speed of per hour before having to land, unable to see the pylons marking the turns due to smoke in the cockpit. Monti completed the first lap at an average speed of per hour, but his M.67s radiator burst as he began the second lap; scalded by steam and boiling water entering his cockpit, Monti managed to make an emergency landing and was taken to a hospital.Va≈°iƒçek 2002, p. 36. The M.52R completed the race, taking second place. During the banquet celebrating the end of the race, Balbo said, \\"We have finished playing our part as sportsmen. Tomorrow our work as competitors will begin,\\" signalling Italy's intention to be more competitive in the next Schneider Trophy race, scheduled for 1931.

This includes the regulation of the Italian stock exchange, the Borsa Italiana. History The Italian Companies and Exchange Commission (CONSOB) was founded in 1974 through legislation merging the functions and jurisdictions that until then had been part of the Italian Ministry of Treasury. This was primarily power to monitor the securities markets. Over time CONSOBs powers and responsibilities have expanded significantly. In 1983 a new law extended its jurisdiction to protecting public savings, and two years later CONSOB received juridical personality and autonomy. In 1991, it was attributed powers to audit securities brokerage companies and monitor insider trading. Responsibilities and functions CONSOB carries out several functions: * it regulates the investment services and operations of intermediaries, the reporting obligations of companies listed on regulated markets, and the solicitation of investment from the public; * it authorizes the operations of regulated markets, the publication of prospectuses, the centralized management of financial instruments, and enrolment in registers; * it monitors the operations of market management companies, the transparency and orderly conduct of trading, and the transparency and fairness of the conduct of intermediaries and financial representatives; * it penalizes any unfair conduct by the above-mentioned parties; * it checks the information provided to the market by entities that solicit investment from the public, as well as the information contained in the accounting documents of listed companies. Organisation structure CONSOB is headed by a collegiate body consisting of a chairman (as of November 2019 Paolo Savona; his predecessors include Mario Nava, Giuseppe Vegas, Lamberto Cardia, Luigi Spaventa, Enzo Berlanda, and Franco Piga) and four members, appointed by a decree of the President of the Republic on the proposal of the President of the Council of Ministers, who remain in office for seven years and their term is non-renewable. The organizational structure includes a central management committee under which there are eleven departments (issuers, intermediaries, markets, etc.) and thirty-nine divisions (company controls, public tender offers and ownership structure, financial representatives monitoring and register, insider trading, derivatives markets, etc.), with offices in Rome and Milan.

Early life Coleman was born in Buffalo, New York to John Hull Coleman (1813) and Charlotte Augusta (n√©e Caryl) Coleman. His younger brother was Caryl Coleman (1847‚Äì1930), an ecclesiologist, church glass manufacturer and decorator who was educated at Bellevue Medical College and Canisius College, and who married Nonna Agnes Black. Caryl opened the church department of the Tiffany Company in New York in 1889 and operated it for 10 years. In 1899 he founded the Church Glass and Decorating Company of New York which manufactured a variety of decorative and stained-glass windows for various churches, academic institutions, and other private and public buildings. His maternal grandparents were Capt. Benjamin Caryl and Susan Young. His paternal grandparents were Charles H. Coleman (1787‚Äì1880) and Doreas (n√©e Hull) Coleman (1791‚Äì1822). Charles was a descendant of Thomas Coleman of Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, who came to Boston in 1635 and moved to Nantucket in 1663 after living in Newbury, Massachusetts.Adrienne Baxter Bell, \\"Utopian Pastiche: The Still Life Paintings of Charles Caryl Coleman,\\" in A Seamless Web: Euro-American Art in the Nineteenth Century. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2014, pp. 147-62. He was raised in Buffalo and studied art under William Holbrook Beard \\"and an itinerant painter, Andrew Andrews whose real name was Isaacs.\\" Career Between 1859 and 1862, Coleman studied in Paris under Thomas Couture, returning during the American Civil War to serve with the Union Army during which he was seriously wounded in South Carolina and recovered in New York City. He returned to Europe in 1866 with fellow painters William Morris Hunt and Elihu Vedder. In 1865, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. From 1863 to 1866, Coleman maintained a studio in New York. It was first at 840 and later at 896 Broadway. He regularly showed his work in the exhibitions of the Brooklyn Art Academy and the National Academy of Design in New York. In 1866, he left America again and spent time painting in London, Paris, and Brittany. He then moved to a Roman apartment previously occupied by poet John Keats, living there from the late 1860s to the mid 1880s, before finally settling in Capri. Coleman's decorative panels constitute his greatest contributions to nineteenth-century art. These paintings, which represent attenuated branches of flowering fruit trees or azaleas, can be compared only to the oversized stained glass panels of John La Farge and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Embodying all of the characteristics of the international aesthetic movement, they also depict Japanese fans, Chinese pots, maiolica vases, Venetian vases, Islamic tapestries, and Indian textiles.See Adrienne Baxter Bell, \\"Echoes of the East, Echoes of the Past: Charles Caryl Coleman's Azaleas and Apple Blossoms at the de Young Museum, San Francisco,\\" in Locating American Art: Finding Art's Meaning in Museums, Colonial Period to the Present. Edited by Cynthia Fowler and Kimberlee Cloutier Blazzard. London: Ashgate, 2016, pp. 33-45. In 1893, Coleman returned to the United States briefly. While there, he was commissioned to paint and decorate the interiors of the New-York State Building at the Chicago World's Fair, along with fellow artists Frank D. Millet and Elmer E. Garnsey. In 1899, Avery Galleries at 368 Fifth Avenue in New York held an exhibition with forty of his pictures and drawings. Another was held there in 1902, featuring over fifty paintings and pastels made by Coleman. The place of honor was given to his contribution to the 1901 Pan- American Exposition, held in his hometown of Buffalo, titled Saintly Dreams by Early Moonlight. It was a saint with a solid golden halo, flowing black hair, a red gown, and a branch of red roses on her lap. The New York Times stated that she \\"seems to have felt the languor and bewitchment of a Capri moonlight. She lounges on a white-tiled bench between round stucco columns, flowering shrubs in pots before her, and above her head a lattice running from pillar to pillar. Strong shadows fall about her from the moonlight, leaving her head in the shade.\\" Capri In 1870, he converted the guesthouse of the former convent of Santa Teresa into Villa Narcissus. A part of the villa was dedicated to a \\"palace of art\\" with antiquities and his own paintings. Coleman, a friend of prominent Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton, a grandson of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, found Villa Narcissus, a villa near his, for Hamilton in 1894. Villa Narcissus was later purchased from him by Rose O'Neill, his friend and also an American artist. O'Neill permitted Coleman to live out the remainder of his days there, and he remained at the Villa until his death in 1928. Personal life In 1875, Coleman married Mary Edith Grey Alsager (d. 1906), who worked with the Red Cross during the Franco- Prussian War of 1870, treating both French and German soldiers. They did not have any children and Mary predeceased him. In his June 1916 will, he bequeathed all of his estate in a life trust fund for the benefit of his brother, Caryl Coleman (d. 1930). The will further dictates that after his brother's death, the estate shall go to his friend, Mrs. Rose O'Neill Wilson, of Saugatuck, Connecticut. In the event that Mrs. Wilson died before his brother, the property goes to Anita Vedder (1873‚Äì1954), the daughter of his friend Elihu Vedder of Capri. In the event all predeceased him, the estate would go to the American Academy in Rome.

History The creation of the Franc-Garde was announced on 30 January 1943 and it was deployed on 2 June of the same year in the Calabres camp near Vichy with Jean de Vaugelas serving as its commander. This group was successful in its recruitment because the volunteers were promised a salary of 3,600 francs. By 1944, the group had swelled to 131 mostly young fighting men.. Once it saw action, the Franc-Garde became the most important connecting link to the SS. Some of its members were also documented serving in the 1945 battle of Berlin, taking part in the defense of the city's government district. The Milice also used the group as a recruitment ground for volunteers who would serve in the Waffen SS, particularly those that would be deployed in the SS Charlemagne Division. This recruitment earned the Milice the light arms that were used within France. The field of action of the Franc-Garde, initially confined to the former free zone, was formally extended to the former occupied zone as of January 27, 1944. Its role was to support the national revolution undertaken by the Vichy government in predominantly involved in policing, but also assisting, inter alia, the clearing of bombed cities. In the words of Secretary General of the French Militia, Joseph Darnand, in his keynote address January 30, 1943, the Franc-Garde should be \\"technically trained and combat-ready in order to be at all times prepared to maintain order\\". The Franc-Garde had its own publication: L'assaut (The Assault). The Franc-Garde consisted of two parts: the permanent Franc-Garde, cantoned and paid, and the Franc-Garde volunteers, who were selected ordinary militiamen and could be mobilized for precise and timely action when summoned. The first two units (trentaines - see Organization below) were formed on an experimental basis in Lyon and Annecy, the cities where there was the most dissent. In principle, any intervention by the Free Guard was to be preceded by a verbal or written requisition sent by the prefect to the officer commanding the required unit, but this was not always the case in practice. In October ‚Äì November 1944, faced with the advance of allied troops, several thousand militiamen (out of a total of ten- to fifteen-thousand) left the national territory. Among them, about 2,500 franc-gardes were declared fit to fight: * 1800 were sent to the Lager Heuberg camp See entry of fallen or deceased soldiers of the \\"Marsch-Btl. Franc Garde\\" in the following two lists. First list: Kriegsgraeber Ehrenfriedhof A, B, C, E Nr. B 58, Friedhofsamt Tuebingen, and second list: Oeffentliche Kriegsgraeberliste vom 11. Januar 1954, Friedhofsamt Tuebingen near the city of Ulm in Germany where they were placed in the 57th SS Infantry Regiment, formed mostly of survivors of the LVF, and in the 58th SS Infantry Regiment formed of survivors of the Sturmbrigade Frankreich, in the context of the 33rd SS Grenadier Division Charlemagne. * 500 formed an infantry battalion, under the direct command of Carus, the naval officer and former chief of staff of the Militia, who went on to fight Italian partisans alongside the RSI fascists in Northern Italy. Organization and equipment Members of the Resistance captured by the milice. Organization The Franc-Garde consisted of volunteers (typically enrolled after a year's membership in the Militia), aged 18 to 45 years old, living in barracks and paid based on the official salary of a sergeant of the Police National. * Organisation: ** main (hand) consisting of a chief and four men; ** dizaine (ten) (corresponding to a combat group); ** trentaine (thirty) a small section ‚Äì in principle at least one in each provincial capital; ** centaine (hundred) a small company ‚Äì in principle at least one in each regional capital city. There were two types: \\"normal\\" ‚Äì traveling on foot or bicycle and \\"mobile\\" ‚Äì with motorbikes, cars and trucks; ** cohorte (cohort) a small battalion of three hundred; ** centre (center) a small regiment of several cohorts. The above names did not necessarily correspond to the true size of a unit. For example, the trentaine d'Annecy, which became a centaine, had only 72 men in May 1944. According to the Information Service of the French Committee of National Liberation in February 1944, the Franc-Garde numbered 1687: a cohorte in Vichy, a centaine in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse, and a trentaine in each of forty-five departments of the south. In any case, even with the mobilization of volunteers in the spring and summer 1944, the Franc-Garde never exceeded 4,000 men. Uniform The Francs-Gardes, the only uniformed militia, adopted the 1941 dark blue Alpine dress uniform (\\"ski\\" trousers worn with gaiters and boots, jacket and belt, khaki shirt, black tie, beret tilted to the left). The symbol of a white Greek letter gamma, on black, was used in a metal badge worn in the right buttonhole and in an embroidered badge on the beret. In combat situations, usually in the fight against the guerrillas, the Franc-Garde might wear an Adrian helmet. Armament Due to the reluctance of the German Army, the Franc-Garde was only slowly and gradually armed. Officers had pistols from the outset, but it was not until autumn 1943, following the upsurge in attacks against its members, that the Franc-Garde received some pistols recovered from British drops to the Resistance. In January 1944 the Franc-Garde was authorized to draw on stockpiles of arms built up after the military armistice, and in March 1944 it was authorized to form a machine gun and mortar section to participate in the attack on the wooded country of Maquis_des_Gli√®res resistance group. Finally, each dizaine was equipped with two Sten submachine guns, the French MAC 24/29 machine gun and MAS 36 rifles. As a result of refusal by the Germans, the Franc-Garde was never issued with heavy weapons, artillery or armored vehicles. In 1944 also, a Franc-Garde school was set up in Poitiers.Jean-Henri Calmon, Occupation, R√©sistance et Lib√©ration dans la Vienne en 30 questions , Geste √©ditions, coll.

Paratrooper Battalion 263 was fully airmobile and could act both as air assault infantry or could be dropped by parachute into the area of operations.  History  The battalion was activated as the third combat battalion of Airborne Brigade 26 on April 1, 1982. Since 1985, the headquarters of the battalion have been hosted in Zweibr√ºcken. The unit temporarily belonged to the multiliteral AMF(L) Brigade. It has taken part in overseas operations since 1993 when large parts of the battalion deployed to Somalia. Since then, Paratrooper Battalion 263 has taken part in numerous operations all over the globe and spent much time in northern Afghanistan, as part of the Kunduz Province Campaign, battling the resurgent Taliban insurgency. In 2006, the battalion attracted attention when some of its infantrymen were involved in the desecration of an Afghan cemetery. Nonetheless, with four of the nation's highest awards for gallantry - among other - having been awarded to its members, Paratrooper Battalion 263 is the most decorated unit of the modern German Army. In 2008, the battalion's 2nd company suffered casualties to the amount of one quarter of its manpower.

The assistant uses voice queries, gesture based control, focus-tracking and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized. Siri is a spin-off from a project originally developed by the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center. Its speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications, and Siri uses advanced machine learning technologies to function. Its original American, British, and Australian voice actors recorded their respective voices around 2005, unaware of the recordings' eventual usage in Siri. The voice assistant was released as an app for iOS in February 2010, and it was acquired by Apple two months later. Siri was then integrated into iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011. At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store. Siri has since become an integral part of Apple's products, having been adapted into other hardware devices over the years, including newer iPhone models, as well as iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, AirPods, Apple TV, and HomePod. Siri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS- integrated apps. With the release of iOS 10 in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, ride-sharing, and Internet calling apps. With the release of iOS 11, Apple updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, started supporting follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions. Siri's original release on iPhone 4S in 2011 received mixed reviews. It received praise for its voice recognition and contextual knowledge of user information, including calendar appointments, but was criticized for requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility. It was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places, and for its inability to understand certain English accents. In 2016 and 2017, a number of media reports said that Siri lacked innovation, particularly against new competing voice assistants. The reports concerned Siri's limited set of features, \\"bad\\" voice recognition, and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for Apple in the field of artificial intelligence and cloud-based services; the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development, as caused by Apple's prioritization of user privacy and executive power struggles within the company.  Development  Siri is a spin-out from the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center, and is an offshoot of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA)-funded CALO project. It was co-founded by Dag Kittlaus, Tom Gruber, and UCLA alumnus Adam Cheyer. Kittlaus named Siri after a co-worker in Norway, and it means \\"beautiful woman who leads you to victory\\" in Norwegian. Siri's speech recognition engine was provided by Nuance Communications, a speech technology company. This was acknowledged by neither Apple nor Nuance for years, until Nuance CEO Paul Ricci confirmed the information at a 2011 technology conference. The speech recognition system makes use of sophisticated machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory. The initial Siri prototype was implemented using the Active platform, a joint project between the Artificial Intelligence Center of SRI International and the Vrai Group at Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. The Active platform was the focus of a Ph.D. thesis led by Didier Guzzoni, who joined Siri as its chief scientist. Siri was acquired by Apple Inc. in April 2010 under the direction of Steve Jobs. Apple's first notion of a digital personal assistant was originally a concept video in 1987, called the Knowledge Navigator.  Voices  The original American voice of Siri was provided in July 2005 by Susan Bennett, unaware that it would eventually be used for the voice assistant. A report from The Verge in September 2013 about voice actors, their work, and machine learning developments, made hints that Allison Dufty was the voice behind Siri, though this was disproven when Dufty wrote on her website that she was \\"absolutely, positively not the voice of Siri.\\" Citing growing pressure, Bennett revealed her role as Siri in October, and her claim was proven by Ed Primeau, an American audio forensics expert. Apple has never confirmed the information. The original British male voice was provided by Jon Briggs, a former technology journalist. Having discovered that he was the voice of Siri by watching television, he first spoke only about his role in November 2011, also acknowledging his voice work was done \\"five or six years ago\\" without knowing the recordings' final usage form. The original Australian voice was provided by Karen Jacobsen, a voice-over artist known in Australia for her work as the GPS girl. As part of an interview between all three voice actors and The Guardian, Briggs stated that \\"the original system was recorded for a US company called Scansoft, who were then bought by Nuance. Apple simply licensed it.\\" With iOS 11, Apple auditioned hundreds of candidates to find new female voices and then recorded several hours of speech, including different personalities and expressions, to build a new text-to-speech voice based on deep learning technology.  Integration  Siri was originally released as a stand-alone application for the iOS operating system in February 2010, and at the time, the developers were also intending to release Siri for Android and BlackBerry devices. Two months later, Apple acquired Siri. On October 4, 2011, Apple introduced the iPhone 4S with a beta version of Siri. After the announcement, Apple removed the existing standalone Siri app from App Store. TechCrunch wrote that, despite the Siri app's support for iPhone 4, its removal from App Store might also have had a financial aspect for the company, in providing an incentive for customers to upgrade devices. Third-party developer Steven Troughton-Smith, along with 13-year-old Zak Shafi (@zshafi), however, managed to port Siri to iPhone 4, though without being able to communicate with Apple's servers. A few days later, Shafi and Troughton-Smith, working with an anonymous person nicknamed \\"Chpwn\\", managed to fully hack Siri, enabling its full functionalities on iPhone 4 and iPod Touch devices. Shafi split from the group, founding SimplySiri with other developers to provide public access to the new founded exploit. Additionally, developers were also able to successfully create and distribute legal ports of Siri to any device capable of running iOS 5, though a proxy server was required for Apple server interaction. Siri Remote for the Apple TV Over the years, Apple has expanded the line of officially supported products, including newer iPhone models, as well as iPad support in June 2012, iPod Touch support in September 2012, Apple TV support, and the stand-alone Siri Remote, in September 2015, Mac and AirPods support in September 2016, and HomePod support in February 2018. Venture capital firm Mangrove Capital Partners predicted that Apple will launch a SiriOS at its developer conference in 2020 to further grow the Siri ecosystem. SiriOS could rival something like Amazon's Alexa Skills platform, which makes it easy for developers to implement Alexa functionality. Apple currently offers SiriKit to developers, but one possibility is that a SiriOS could work across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS with ease.  Features and options  Apple offers a wide range of voice commands to interact with Siri, including, but not limited to: * Phone and Text actions, such as \\"Call Sarah\\", \\"Read my new messages\\", \\"Set the timer for 10 minutes\\", and \\"Send email to mom\\" * Check basic information, including \\"What's the weather like today?\\" and \\"How many dollars are in a euro?\\" * Schedule events and reminders, including \\"Schedule a meeting\\" and \\"Remind me to...\\" * Handle device settings, such as \\"Take a picture\\", \\"Turn off Wi-Fi\\", and \\"Increase the brightness\\" * Search the Internet, including \\"Define...\\", \\"Find pictures of...\\", and \\"Search Twitter for...\\" * Navigation, including \\"Take me home\\", \\"What's traffic like on the way home?\\", and \\"Find driving directions to...\\" * Translate words and phrases from English to a few languages, such as \\"How do I say where is the nearest hotel in French?\\" * Entertainment, such as \\"What basketball games are on today?\\", \\"What are some movies playing near me?\\", and \\"What's the synopsis of...?\\" * Engage with iOS-integrated apps, including \\"Pause Apple Music\\" and \\"Like this song\\" * Handle payments through Apple Pay, such as \\"Apple Pay 25 dollars to Mike for concert tickets\\" or \\"Send 41 dollars to Ivana.\\" Siri also offers numerous pre-programmed responses to amusing questions. Such questions include \\"What is the meaning of life?\\" to which Siri may reply \\"All evidence to date suggests it's chocolate\\"; \\"Why am I here?\\", to which it may reply \\"I don't know. Frankly, I've wondered that myself\\"; and \\"Will you marry me?\\", to which it may respond with \\"My End User Licensing Agreement does not cover marriage. My apologies.\\" Initially limited to female voices, Apple announced in June 2013 that Siri would feature a gender option, adding a male voice counterpart. In September 2014, Apple added the ability for users to speak \\"Hey Siri\\" to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device. In September 2015, the \\"Hey Siri\\" feature was updated to include individualized voice recognition, a presumed effort to prevent non- owner activation. With the announcement of iOS 10 in June 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party developer access to Siri through a dedicated application programming interface (API). The API restricts usage of Siri to engaging with third-party messaging apps, payment apps, ride-sharing apps, and Internet calling apps. In iOS 11, Siri is able to handle follow-up questions, supports language translation, and opens up to more third-party actions, including task management. Additionally, users are able to type to Siri, and a new, privacy-minded \\"on-device learning\\" technique improves Siri's suggestions by privately analyzing personal usage of different iOS applications.  Reception  Siri received mixed reviews during its beta release as an integrated part of iPhone 4S in October 2011. MG Siegler of TechCrunch wrote that Siri was \\"great,\\" praising the potential for Siri after losing the beta tag: > \\"The amount of times Siri hasn't been able to understand and execute my > request is astonishingly low.... Just imagine what will happen when Apple > partners with other services to expand Siri further. And imagine when they > have an API that any developer can use. This really could alter the mobile > landscape.\\" Writing for The New York Times, David Pogue also praised Siri's language understanding and ability to understand context: > \\"[Siri] thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted response > and speaks in a calm female voice.... It's mind-blowing how inexact your > utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, 'What's the weather > going to be like in Tucson this weekend?' to 'Will I need an umbrella > tonight?'... Once, I tried saying, 'Make an appointment with Patrick for > Thursday at 3.' Siri responded, 'Note that you already have an all-day > appointment about \\"Boston Trip\\" for this Thursday. Shall I schedule this > anyway?' Unbelievable.\\" Jacqui Cheng of Ars Technica wrote that Apple's claims of what Siri could do were bold, and the early demos \\"even bolder\\": > \\"Though Siri shows real potential, these kinds of high expectations are > bound to be disappointed.... Apple makes clear that the product is still in > beta‚Äîan appropriate label, in our opinion.\\" While praising its ability to \\"decipher our casual language\\" and deliver \\"very specific and accurate result,\\" sometimes even providing additional information, Cheng noted and criticized its restrictions, particularly when the language moved away from \\"stiffer commands\\" into more human interactions. One example included the phrase \\"Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud,\\" which Siri interpreted as sending a message to Jason only, containing the text \\"Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud.\\" She also noted a lack of proper editability, as saying \\"Edit message to say: We're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us,\\" generated \\"Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud to say we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us.\\" Google's executive chairman and former chief, Eric Schmidt, conceded that Siri could pose a competitive threat to the company's core search business. Siri was criticized by pro-abortion rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and NARAL Pro-Choice America, after users found that Siri could not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers nearby, sometimes directing users to crisis pregnancy centers instead. Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, told The New York Times: > \\"Our customers want to use Siri to find out all types of information, and > while it can find a lot, it doesn't always find what you want.... These are > not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone. It simply means that as we > bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places where we can do > better, and we will in the coming weeks.\\" In January 2016, Fast Company reported that, in then-recent months, Siri had begun to confuse the word \\"abortion\\" with \\"adoption\\", citing \\"health experts\\" who stated that the situation had \\"gotten worse.\\" However, at the time of Fast Companys report, the situation had changed slightly, with Siri offering \\"a more comprehensive list of Planned Parenthood facilities\\", although \\"Adoption clinics continue to pop up, but near the bottom of the list.\\" Siri has also not been well received by some English speakers with distinctive accents, including Scottish and Americans from Boston or the South. In March 2012, Frank M. Fazio filed a class action lawsuit against Apple on behalf of the people who bought iPhone 4S and felt misled about the capabilities of Siri, alleging its failing to function as depicted in Apple's Siri commercials. Fazio filed the lawsuit in California and claimed that the iPhone 4S was merely a \\"more expensive iPhone 4\\" if Siri fails to function as advertised. On July 22, 2013, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in San Francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time. The reason given for dismissal was that plaintiffs did not sufficiently document enough misrepresentations by Apple for the trial to proceed.  Perceived lack of innovation  In June 2016, The Verges Sean O'Kane wrote about the then- upcoming major iOS 10 updates, with a headline stating \\"Siri's big upgrades won't matter if it can't understand its users\\": > \\"What Apple didn't talk about was solving Siri's biggest, most basic flaws: > it's still not very good at voice recognition, and when it gets it right, > the results are often clunky. And these problems look even worse when you > consider that Apple now has full-fledged competitors in this space: Amazon's > Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Assistant.\\" Also writing for The Verge, Walt Mossberg had previously questioned Apple's efforts in cloud-based services, writing: > \\"...perhaps the biggest disappointment among Apple's cloud-based services is > the one it needs most today, right now: Siri. Before Apple bought it, Siri > was on the road to being a robust digital assistant that could do many > things, and integrate with many services‚Äîeven though it was being built by a > startup with limited funds and people. After Apple bought Siri, the giant > company seemed to treat it as a backwater, restricting it to doing only a > few, slowly increasing a number of tasks, like telling you the weather, > sports scores, movie and restaurant listings, and controlling the device's > functions. Its unhappy founders have left Apple to build a new AI service > called Viv. And, on too many occasions, Siri either gets things wrong, > doesn't know the answer, or can't verbalize it. Instead, it shows you a web > search result, even when you're not in a position to read it.\\" In October 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple had plans to unify the teams behind its various cloud-based services, including a single campus and reorganized cloud computing resources aimed at improving the processing of Siri's queries, although another report from The Verge, in June 2017, once again called Siri's voice recognition \\"bad.\\" In June 2017, The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report on the lack of innovation with Siri following competitors' advancement in the field of voice assistants. Noting that Apple workers' anxiety levels \\"went up a notch\\" on the announcement of Amazon's Alexa, the Journal wrote: \\"Today, Apple is playing catch-up in a product category it invented, increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge.\\" The report gave the primary causes being Apple's prioritization of user privacy, including randomly-tagged six-month Siri searches, whereas Google and Amazon keep data until actively discarded by the user and executive power struggles within Apple. Apple did not comment on the report, while Eddy Cue said: \\"Apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve Siri's performance for individual users with information kept on their iPhones.\\"  Swearing  The iOS version of Siri ships with a vulgar content filter; however, it is disabled by default and must be enabled by the user manually. Therefore, if Siri can be triggered into cursing, broadcasting discriminatory content, and so on, the actions will most likely be carried out. Over its history, multiple methods and techniques have been used to trigger Siri into swearing. The language-filter is not perfect and can still be bypassed. In 2018, Ars Technica reported a new glitch that could be exploited by a user requesting the definition of \\"mother\\" be read out loud. Siri would issue a response and ask the user if they would like to hear the next definition; when the user replies with \\"yes,\\" Siri would mention \\"mother\\" as being short for \\"motherf***er.\\" This resulted in multiple YouTube videos featuring the responses and/or how to trigger them. Apple fixed the issue silently, although it is unconfirmed if the videos specifically brought it to their attention. The content is picked up from third-party sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary and not a supplied message from the corporation. It is unknown whether this glitch was exploited with the vulgar content filter enabled.  In pop culture  Siri provided the voice of 'Puter in The Lego Batman Movie. In The Big Bang Theory episode, ‚ÄúThe Beta Test Initiation‚Äù the character Raj Koothrappali falls in love with Siri.

A Field Guide to Diseases & Insect Pests of Northern & Central Rocky Mountain Conifers: Juniper Mistletoe It is a shrub producing many erect and spreading yellow-green branches 20 to 40 centimeters long from a woody base where it attaches to its host tree, tapping the xylem for water and nutrients. It is hemiparasitic, meaning it contains some chlorophyll and can photosynthesize some energy for itself as well. The smooth, noded branches have flattened, scale-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, with male and female individuals producing different forms of inflorescence with knobby flower clusters. Female flowers yield shiny light pink spherical berries each about 4 millimeters wide. Birds eat the fruits and excrete the undigested seeds on tree branches, where they root.

It has smooth, mottled bark, lance-shaped to curved or egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus racemosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of , rarely a mallee, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mottled white, yellow, grey or cream-coloured bark with insect scribbles. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, egg-shaped leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved or egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded or conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from July to September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus racemosa was first formally described in 1797 by the botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in his book Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum. The specific epithet (racemosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"having racemes\\", which is a misnomer, as it does not have flowers in racemes. Distribution and habitat Snappy gum grows in woodland and forest, sometimes in pure stands, on poor sandstone soils in mid to high rainfall areas. It is found along the coast, tablelands and western slopes from Bombala, Bathurst and Albury in New South Wales to Gympie and Bundaberg in south-eastern Queensland. Ecology The distinctive scribbles often found on the bark of this eucalypt are caused by the scribbly gum moth, Ogmograptis racmosa.

Career Early military and party positions Davila is a retired air force officer. Davila knew Hugo Chavez as a cadet in the armored Briage of San Fernando de Apure. Davila asked to be discharged from the military in 1990, even though he had been considered for the position of general under the president Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez. Instead he retired from being a Commander of a unit in the Army of Venezuela and dedicated himself to cattle ranching. Davila recollects being ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù at the attempt to change the Venezuelan government in 1992, when Chavez attempted an unsuccessful military coup. In 1994 Chavez asked Davila to help him on a political project. Davila was elected to the Venezuelan Senate in the 1998 elections, becoming its president before the Senate was removed by the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela.https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/chavez-despojo-poder- congreso-venezolano_0_S1LfAa2gAFg.html Minister of the Interior In 2000, Davila became the Minister of the Interior of Venezuela. In February 2000, while Minister of the Interior, Davila ‚Äúblamed the media for the criminality rampant in the country [of Venezuela].‚Äù Davila was Minister of the Interior until February 2001, when he was appointed to the foreign affairs department and was replaced as Interior Minister by Luis Miquilena, a political mentor to Chavez. At the time, the Los Angeles Times reported that Colonel Luis Alfonso Davila had been \\"under fire recently for failing to curb Venezuela's rising crime rate.\\" Minister of Foreign Relations In February 2001 Davila was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela.\\"Venezuelan cabinet reshuffle\\", BBC News, 4 February 2001.\\"Venezuelan Leader Marks Anniversary of His Failed Coup; Government: President, once a rebel chief, leads caravan of supporters\\", Los Angeles Times, 5 February 2001. In 2001, while Minister of Foreign Relations, Davila prepared and published a document ‚Äúusing the traditional mantra that in Venezuela there is no racism, only mestizaje.‚Äù The Afro-Venezuelan Network criticized the document, confronting Davila at the Third World Conference against Racism in Durban, South Africa that year. In response to arguments that Davila had not read the document, Davila agreed to alter the document to meet the organization‚Äôs concerns. On November 29 and 30 of 2001, Davila made an official visit to Guyana, meeting with president Bharrat Jagdeo and paying courtesy visits to Ralph Ramkarran, Desmond Hoyte, and Edwin Carrington. Discussions dealt with Venezuela‚Äôs territorial claim, and the Caracas Energy Cooperation Accord. In the conversations, Davila asserted that his country would be ‚Äúwilling to grant Guyana beneficiary status under the accord.‚Äù Starting in 2001, the moderate political movement in Venezuela was headed by Davila, who took the position from Chavez‚Äôs right-hand man Luis Miquilena. Davila ‚Äúplaced [his] followers at all levels,‚Äù and like Miquilena, he rejected Cuban socialism in favor of consolidation over radicalization. He opposed the April 2002 coup. He was replaced as foreign minister by Roy Chaderton in May 2002,\\"Chavez Swears in Foreign Minister\\", Associated Press, 31 May 2002. having briefly been replaced by Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Iturbe in 2002. Davila exited the Chavista movement in 2003, after his thorough defeat in the 2003 internal elections of the Chavista party. In the 2008 regional elections he stood as an independent, gaining less than 1% of the vote.

The first named storm of the active 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June 1 off the coast of Mexico. It initially moved toward the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm toward Mexico and Guatemala. After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction toward the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned toward and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Andres was the first of many storms of the season, with above- average activity due to one of the strongest El Ni√±o events on record. In most of May 1997, strong westerlies extended across the eastern Pacific Ocean, which inhibited tropical cyclogenesis. Toward the end of the month, however, wind shear decreased in the easternmost portion of the basin, which allowed a low-level circulation to develop; it is possible the system originated from a tropical wave that traversed the Atlantic Ocean in the previous two weeks. Deep convection increased over the circulation on May 31, prompting classifications with the Dvorak technique. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression One-E early on June 1, about 345 miles (555 km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The tropical cyclone was never well-organized, and after its formation, the convection became elongated. As the entire system moved northwestward, another circulation developed which eventually became the dominant center, causing the original circulation to dissipate. Midday on June 2, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Andres. The next day, steering winds forced the storm east-northeastward, and on June 4, Andres attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). A trough bypassed the storm to the north and changed the steering flow toward the southeast. This produced a track paralleling the Central America coastline; such a track was considered \\"unprecedented\\" by the National Hurricane Center in the database for all eastern Pacific storms. Initially, the storm was expected to continue moving toward Mexico and Guatemala. Turning southeastward, Tropical Storm Andres passed about 35 miles (55 km) off the coast of Guatemala, before it began weakening due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The convection became amorphous and later shifted to the southeast of the circulation. On June 6 Andres weakened to tropical depression status. It turned northward and moved ashore near San Salvador, El Salvador on June 7, which was the first recorded landfall in the country. The low-level circulation quickly dissipated over land, although the mid-level circulation persisted across Central America. After the featured reached the western Caribbean Sea, a new surface circulation developed, and initially, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the development of a significant storm in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Instead, the system remained disorganized, bringing rainfall to Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas before it was absorbed by a weak trough in the Gulf of Mexico. Impact and preparations Rainfall map in Mexico When Tropical Storm Andres first turned to the northeast, tropical storm warnings were issued from Punta Galera, Mexico to the Mexico/Guatemala border. A tropical storm warning was later issued from Champerico, Guatemala to the Mexican border. All of the warnings were dropped when Andres turned toward the southeast. Later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Guatemala and El Salvador, but it was quickly canceled. Due to the threat of the storm, officials closed ports along the southern Mexican coastline, and also advised for small boats to excise caution. Throughout its life, Andres produced rainfall along the coast of Mexico, in Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas, as well as through the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The highest total in the country was 11.42 inches (29 cm) in Mazat√°n, Chiapas. Heavy rainfall and high seas spread across western Central America. In El Salvador and Nicaragua, the storm led to power outages, traffic accidents, and overflown rivers, as well as destroyed bridges and buildings in Nicaragua. Two fishermen were left missing in Nicaragua, and the storm damaged 91 houses and destroyed 82 more, leaving a total of 1,259 people homeless. There were 4 deaths in El Salvador where Andres made landfall. The remnants of Andres brought rainfall to Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas. In Florida, the system produced a daily record precipitation of 5.89 inches (15 cm) at the Miami International Airport; the rainfall led to street flooding, accidents, and housing damage.

It drains approximately of Jackson County. Its two forks, the North Fork and the South Fork, both begin high in the Cascade Range near Mount McLoughlin. Flowing predominantly west, they meet near the city of Butte Falls. The main stem flows generally northwest until it empties into the Rogue Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries. Big Butte Creek's watershed was originally settled over 8,000 years ago by the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries. Big Butte Springs, located in the watershed, provides clean drinking water to more than 115,000 residents of the Rogue Valley. It emits over of water per day. Water from Big Butte Creek is also diverted for irrigation at several other locations. The water quality of the Big Butte Creek watershed is generally high, and it supports several species of trout and salmon. The watershed is also home to more than 152 species of birds, 63 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles, and numerous plants. The Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management in 1995 to protect several rare species of plants.  Course  Big Butte Creek begins in the Cascade Range near Butte Falls. It flows generally northwest over approximately to its confluence with the Rogue River. The two main forks of Big Butte Creek, the North Fork and the South Fork, merge at above sea level, while the creek's mouth is located at an elevation of . The North Fork's headwaters are located on the slopes of the Rustler Peak. It flows southwest, receiving many small tributaries such as Jackass, Eighty Acre, and Friese creeks. Turning west, it flows just north of Butte Falls before merging with the South Fork. The South Fork begins at the confluence of two of its tributaries, Twincheria and Rancheria creeks. It flows southwest, receiving Fourbit Creek on the left. Fourbit Creek begins near Mount McLoughlin, where massive faults may allow water to seep into it from nearby Fourmile Lake in the Klamath River watershed. The South Fork turns west and receives Willow Creek on the left. Big Butte Springs are located on Willow Creek, and the Medford Aqueduct, which carries drinking water to cities in the Rogue Valley, parallels the South Fork from there all the way to Butte Falls. The South Fork flows over the Butte Falls‚Äîthe nearby city's namesake‚Äîand merges with the North Fork about downstream. Big Butte Creek travels northwest, gathering McNeil Creek on the left and Clark Creek on the right, along with many other minor tributaries. This region contains many Class II and III rapids, as rated on the International Scale of River Difficulty. The stream is crossed by Cobleigh Road at river mile (RM) 9.5 or river kilometer (RK) 15, and Netherlands Road at RM 3 (RK 4.8). About before its mouth, Big Butte Creek cascades over Crowfoot Falls and is crossed by Crowfoot Road. It then flows into the Rogue River from its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. Big Butte Creek's mouth is about one mile southwest of William L. Jess Dam, and Oregon Route 62 passes just north of it.  Discharge  The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of Big Butte Creek at three different stream gauges: two on the South Fork, and one on the main stem. Both South Fork gauges were shut down in 1991, but the gauge located near the mouth of Big Butte Creek continues to operate. The main stem often discharges less water than the South Fork alone in the summer months because of numerous diversions. { |+ Discharge  Stream  Location  Drainage basin  Years recorded  Average flow  Maximum flow  Minimum flow |-  South Fork above Willow Creek  1986‚Äì1991  (February 23, 1986) (August‚ÄìSeptember 1988, September 1990) |-  South Fork near Butte Falls  1911‚Äì1991  (December 22, 1964) (September 1981) |-  Main stem near mouth  1945‚ÄìPresent  (December 22, 1964) (June 23‚Äì24, 1977) |}  Watershed  A map of the Big Butte Creek watershed Big Butte Creek drains approximately of southern Oregon. Elevations range from at the creek's mouth to at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of . About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford. The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from in the winter to in the summer. Precipitation averages between annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs. The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region. Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.  Flora and fauna  The alt=A midsized bird perched on a moss covered limb. It has brown feathers, covered with white to tan spots. Its eyes are round and black, and its beak is short and curved downward. Some of the most common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek watershed include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species have been reported in the Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia. Over 152 species of birds are known or suspected to live in the Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big- eared bat. Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.  History  alt=A short, wide, moderate-sized waterfall surrounded by vegetation Humans have lived in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans inhabited the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek. In 1904, a water-powered sawmill was constructed at Butte Falls. The town of Butte Falls was established in 1906, and incorporated in 1911. The Pacific and Eastern Railway was constructed to Butte Falls in 1910. Butte Falls also received water rights to Ginger Springs, providing high quality drinking water for the town. The Cat Hill Burn destroyed of forest on Rustler Peak in 1910. In 1915, the Eagle Point Irrigation Canal was constructed, diverting approximately of water for irrigation in the Little Butte Creek watershed. The canal begins just below Butte Falls. The Butte Falls Fish Hatchery was also constructed in 1915. Originally, the hatchery impounded water from Ginger Creek, however in 1923 a canal was built transferring of water from the South Fork of Big Butte Creek. The Medford Aqueduct, a pipeline, was constructed in 1927. It delivers about of drinking water from Big Butte Springs south to the Bear Creek watershed. In 1951, a second pipeline was added, and Willow Dam was constructed, creating Willow Lake. The springs serve over 115,000 customers throughout the Rogue Valley. Loggers felled massive amounts of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural regeneration could not keep pace with the rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed. In 1995, the Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) by the Bureau of Land Management. Located about west of Butte Falls, the ACEC is home to several rare species of plants. It was fenced off in 1996 to protect the area from roaming cattle. The Butte Falls Fish Hatchery was scheduled to be closed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in July 2009 as part of a statewide effort to decrease the department's budget, but on July 3 it was announced that the hatchery would continue to operate with only one employee. However, the hatchery was closed permanently in October 2010. A portion of the Eagle Point Irrigation Canal failed on October 2, 2011, sending of muddy water down a hillside, across a road, and into lower Big Butte Creek, a vital salmon spawning area. A stream gauge on the Rogue River about downstream reported turbidity levels twenty times higher than before the breach. The canal was repaired by October 28.  Pollution  The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has monitored Big Butte Creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed the standard level are placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. About of the streams in the Big Butte Creek watershed were listed on the 2004/2006 DEQ 303d list.

A map of the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, which passes through scenic areas of the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest Overall, water quality in the Big Butte Creek watershed is generally high, however road construction and logging can cause severe erosion, leading to high levels of sedimentation and turbidity. The Willow Creek region often experiences high turbidity, but Willow Lake traps the sediment before it can travel downstream. Big Butte Springs provides clean water that requires minimal treatment to meet water quality standards. Water from the springs has very little chemical pollution, low turbidity, and temperatures averaging between .  Recreation  Popular recreational activities in the Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists also come to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin. Water recreation on Willow Lake includes boating, swimming, fishing, and waterskiing. Fishing is also popular in other streams, especially Fourbit Creek. Cross-country skiing and snowmobiling are popular in the winter.

It was founded from St. Joseph of the Holy Family in Manhattanville. The first pastor was Father John J. Keogan, formerly of County Cavan, Ireland. Later German immigrants replaced the Irish.\\"Church of St. Thomas the Apostle (Roman Catholic).\\" Later the congregation became primarily African American. In 1897, Father Keogan purchased St. Michaels's Episcopal Church and used it for services until St. Thomas was completed; after which he turned it into the parish school for 900 students, staffed by the Sisters of Mercy. On April 13, 1913 a fire destroyed the school and damaged the church. classes were resumed in the lower church, until a new school was built. The parish instituted a \\"Penny Fund\\" whereby parishioners contributed a penny a day to retire the debt. The church had many notable connections, including Harry Belafonte's family, who worshipped there; \\"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was said to have been baptized in this church; Hulan E. Jack, the first black borough president of Manhattan, was buried from here.\\" Lacking funds, clergy, and students for its attached parish school, the Catholic Order of Salesians of Don Bosco assumed control over the church and school in 1979, and are largely assumed to have rescued the church, closing the school and reusing it as a community center/computer skills training facility for young women. The training center remained open after the church's closure.J. Russiello, A Sympathetic Planning Hierarchy for Redundant Churches: A Comparison of Continued Use and Reuse in Denmark, England and the United States of America (MSc Conservation of Historic Buildings, University of Bath, 2008), p.163-164, 350. Architecture The present church was built 1907 to designs by Thomas H. Poole & Company, and dedicated the same year. The interior was noted for its remarkable fan vaulting and celebrated German stained glass (from the still operating studio of Mayer of Munich, famed stained glass makers for the Holy See and Catholic churches around the world). The AIA Guide to NYC describes the church as follows: ‚ÄúNo name is to be found on this church, but its finely detailed neo-Gothic fa√ßade, prominently entered via a stairway and an arcaded porch, demands attention.‚Äù The building is a blend of English Perpendicular Gothic, Moorish and Venetian Gothic, in what is described as ‚Äúberserk eclecticism‚Äù, ‚Äúunnameable but wonderful.‚ÄùNorval White and Elliot Willensky, AIA Guide to New York City, rev. ed., (New York: Collier Books, 1978), 272. The interior had intricately carved woodwork; the altar was of white marble. Closure and preservation campaigns Many established churches in the neighborhood have lost their congregations to storefront churches. In 2002, the church which was designed to seat 800 only attracted around 250 parishioners for Sunday Mass. At the same time, substantial facade repairs proved financially crippling. ‚ÄúThe front of the church is covered with posters that read: ‚ÄòDon't be fooled by the present scaffolding! We are open. We are alive. We are growing.‚Äô The posters call St. Thomas ‚Äòthe Catholic Church in Harlem with room for you!‚Äô‚Äù In addition, there were dubious cracks in the main internal columns. The building was condemned in 2003 and the Salesians pulled out. Landmark protection has been debated, as the church is considered one of the finest in Harlem. Heather McCracken of the Landmarks Preservation Commission said that the church was found to be \\"in a deteriorated condition that made it ineligible for landmark designation.\\" The Archdiocese of New York has attempted to demolish the structure since the closure with the offer to replace the structure with affordable housing for the elderly.J. Russiello, A Sympathetic Planning Hierarchy for Redundant Churches: A Comparison of Continued Use and Reuse in Denmark, England and the United States of America (MSc Conservation of Historic Buildings, University of Bath, 2008), p.350. Similar to other similar Catholic churches in the city with stays of demolition, such as Manhattan's Our Lady of Vilnius Church, a number of strategies have been invoked to save St. Thomas. Lawsuits, widespread community and city protests, and concerned letters arriving from as far away as Germany have delayed demolition, although the city has been unwilling to bestow landmark protection. A letter writing campaign attracted a great deal of attention. The son of the German stained glass maker even wrote in support of keeping the stained glass with the original church. However, the stained glass was removed to the new Church of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha in the upstate New York town of Lagrangeville.J.

Plot summary In ancient Greece, Pythias from Athens is on a trip to Syracuse. The tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse sees him as a dangerous follower of the philosopher Pythagoras and condemns him to death. Pythias begs Dionysus to allow him to visit his wife in Athens promising to return to Syracuse to be executed. Pythias' friend Damon volunteers to be held hostage until Pythias returns. Dionysius sees this as the opportunity to demonstrate the falsity of Pythagoras' philosophy. Dionysius allows Pythias to leave but does not expect him to return.

The tiger is full of life and embodies the spirit and drive to achieve and make progress. The tiger has been common in the southern and northeastern China and is revered by the Chinese as a creature with many symbolic attributes. Each direction of the compass is traditionally believed to be ruled by a mythical creature; the White Tiger is the ruler of the West. The tiger is also associated with autumn, when it comes down from the mountains into villages, and is personified by the constellation Orion, which is prominent in autumn. In Chinese astrology, the star Alpha of the Great Bear constellation gave birth to the first tiger. The tiger represents the masculine principle in nature and is king of all the animals, as shown by the four stripes on his forehead, which form the character Wang (Áéã), or King. The tiger is regarded as one of the four super-intelligent creatures, along with the dragon, phoenix and tortoise; for centuries, the four have been a major design motif in Chinese art. In southern China, on the tiger's birthday, on the second moon in the lunar calendar, fixed in the Western calendar as March 6, women worship the White Tiger. They place paper images of the tiger in their homes to keep away rats and snakes and prevent quarrels. On this date, effigies of the tiger are also put in front of temple buildings for people to make offerings. The God of Wealth, the deified Marshal Chao Gongming (Chao Kungming), is depicted riding a black tiger and holding a silver ingot. The Chinese call an able general a \\"tiger general\\" and a brave soldier, a \\"tiger warrior\\". In Chinese folk tales, tigers kill evil men and protect good men. Tiger charms are used to keep away disease and evil, and babies are given colourfully embroidered tiger shoes for protection. Tiger images frequently decorate children's clothing and tops. The \\"Tiger Claw\\" (hu chao) amulet is believed to ward off sudden fright and give the wearer the courage of the tiger. Because the tiger wards off disasters, it is popular as one of the nine gods worshipped at the New Year Festival. Tiger images are painted on the walls of homes and temples to keep away evil spirits. Dragon-Tiger Mountain is the name for the palace of the hereditary head of the Daoist religion, located in the Dragon Tiger Mountains of Jiangxi Province, east of the capital city of Nanchang. Zhang Daoling (Chang Tao-ling), the \\"First Master of Heaven\\" in the Daoist religion, is depicted riding a tiger and carrying a demon-dispelling sword as he escorts the dead to their final destination. A Daoist legend tells of two brothers who took on the role of protecting human beings by capturing demons and throwing them to tigers. As the enemies of evil spirits, especially those who torment the dead, tigers are carved on tombs and monuments. The Chinese system of feng shui (geomancy) requires that a burial site be higher on the right side, the stronger side of the body, so that the White Tiger can guard it; the Azure Dragon guards the left side, the body's weaker side. The Tiger is the third animal in the 12-year animal Zodiac. People born in the Year of the Tiger are thought to be brave, strong, stubborn and sympathetic. The tiger represents the greatest earthly power, as well as protection over human life. It chases away the so-called \\"three disasters\\": fire, thieves and ghosts. Ancient Chinese people believed that tigers turned white after they have lived for five centuries and that tigers could live for an entire millennium. It was also believed that upon the death of a tiger its spirit would enter the earth and become amber, this archaic belief inspired the original Chinese term for amber which was \\"Soul of the Tiger\\". According to Chinese myths, five types of tigers balance the energy in the cosmos, preventing universe from chaos: Black tiger, governs the water element and rules during winter season; blue tiger, governs the earth element and rules during spring; red tiger, governs the fire element and rules during the summer; white tiger, governs the metal element and rules during autumn; and yellow tiger, rules all other tigers and symbolizes the sum. The tiger is historically a Chinese cultural symbol. It has inspired imagination, stories, paintings, and poetry with the tiger: the earliest tiger statue was found in the Neolithic period in China 7000 years ago; the Year of the Tiger, tiger shoes or hats; the Tiger seal, Tiger Tally and Tiger General. There are also idioms and poetic renderings such as: Tiger roaring & dragon singing-the world is peaceful; Mountain and Valley replying- the people are wealthy and the country strong. Islands in Taiwan (ROC) with namings referencing tigers include Hujing Island ('tiger well island') and Menghu Islet ('fierce tiger islet').

(Individual computers on the periphery of networks/clouds are called end nodes.) End nodes often are not managed to the trusted network‚Äòs high computer security standards. End nodes often have weak/outdated software, weak security tools, excessive permissions, mis-configurations, questionable content and apps, and covert exploitations. Cross contamination and unauthorized release of data from within a computer system becomes the problem. Within the vast cyber-ecosystem, these end nodes often attach transiently to one or more clouds/networks, some trustworthy and others not. A few examples: a corporate desktop browsing the Internet, a corporate laptop checking company webmail via a coffee shop's open Wi-Fi access point, a personal computer used to telecommute during the day and gaming at night, or app within a smartphone/tablet (or any of the previous use/device combinations). Even if fully updated and tightly locked down, these nodes may ferry malware from one network (e.g. a corrupted webpage or an infected email message) into another, sensitive network. Likewise, the end nodes may exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g. log keystrokes or screen-capture). Assuming the device is fully trustworthy, the end node must provide the means to properly authenticate the user. Other nodes may impersonate trusted computers, thus requiring device authentication. The device and user may be trusted but within an untrustworthy environment (as determined by inboard sensors' feedback). Collectively, these risks are called the end node problem. There are several remedies but all require instilling trust in the end node and conveying that trust to the network/cloud. The cloud‚Äôs weakest link Cloud computing may be characterized as a vast, seemingly endless, array of processing and storage that one can rent from his or her computer. Recent media attention has focused on the security within the cloud. Many believe the real risk does not lie within a well monitored, 24-7-365 managed, full redundancy cloud host but in the many questionable computers that access the cloud.http://www.nets- find.net/Meetings/S09Meeting/Talks/clark.ppt Many such clouds are FISMA- certified whereas the end nodes connecting to them rarely are configured to any standard.  Ever growing risk  From 2005 to 2009, the greatest and growing threats to personal and corporate data derived from exploits of users' personal computers. Organized cyber-criminals have found it more profitable to internally exploit the many weak personal and work computers than to attack through heavily fortified perimeters.http://www.verizonbusiness.com/resources/security/databreachreport.pdf One common example is stealing small business's online banking account access.  Solutions  To eliminate the end node problem, only allow authenticated users on trusted remote computers in safe environments to connect to your network/cloud. There are many ways to accomplish this with existing technology, each with different levels of trust. Many companies issue typical laptops and only allow those specific computers to remotely connect. For example, the US Department of Defense only allows its remote computers to connect via VPN to its network (no direct Internet browsing) and uses two- factor authentication. Some organizations use server-side tools to scan and/or validate the end node's computer, such as communicating with the node's Trusted Platform Module (TPM). A far higher level of trust can be obtained by issuing an immutable, tamper-resistant client with no local storage, allowing it to connect only after device and user authentication, remotely providing the OS and software (via PXE or Etherboot), and then only providing remote desktop or browser access to sensitive data. A less expensive approach is to trust any hardware (corporate, government, personal, or public) but provide a known kernel and software and require strong authentication of the user. For example, the DoD‚Äôs Software Protection InitiativeDoD Software Protection Initiative offers Lightweight Portable Security, a LiveCD that boots only in RAM creating a pristine, non-persistent, end node while using Common Access Card software for authentication into DoD networks.

There are two kinds of tape labels. The first is a label applied to the exterior of tape cartridge or reel. The second is data recorded on the tape itself. Visual labels Visual labels are human readable. The labels have evolved to have barcodes that can be read by tape libraries. Reading the barcode label is often much faster than mounting the tape volume and reading the identification information written on the media. To read the bar code, the tape library need only position the volume in front of the bar code reader. Magnetic labels Originally, 7- and 9-track data tapes only had human readable labels on them (i.e. as far as the operating system was concerned they were unlabeled). Somebody wishing to use a particular tape would ask the operator to mount that tape; the operator would look at the human readable label, mount it on a tape drive, and then tell the operating system which drive contained the tape of interest. That had some drawbacks: the operator might mount the wrong tape by mistake, or he might type in the wrong identification. A solution was to record some tape identification information on the tape itself in a standard format. This metadata allowed the operating system to quickly recognize a volume and assign it to the program that wanted to use it. The operating system would notice that a tape drive came online, so it would try to read the first block of information on the tape. If that was a volume label, then the operating system could determine what to do with it. Some computer systems used similar labels on other serial media, for example punched card decks and sometimes line printer output. IBM tape labels IBM tape labels with VOL/HDR/EOV/EOF records.http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/index.jsp?topic=/rzatb/vdefn.htm IBM tape labels on 9-track tapes use EBCDIC character encoding; 7-track tapes (now obsolete) used BCD encoding.http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/topic/com.ibm.zos.r12.idam300/labdef.htm ANSI tape labels ANSI/ISO/ECMA tape labels are similar to IBM tape labels but use the ASCII character set on 9-track tape. When originally defined in the mid-1960s, they used BCD on 7-track tape. Burroughs tape labels The Burroughs MCP running on the B5000 was one of the earliest systems to automatically read tape labels. When designed in 1961 it used a proprietary format coded in BCD (strictly, Burroughs Interchange Code or BIC), but was later able to read standard 7-track ANSI (then styled USASI) labels.

The theory has its beginnings in Jean-Pierre Serre and John Tate's study of Tate modules of abelian varieties and the notion of Hodge‚ÄìTate representation. Hodge‚ÄìTate representations are related to certain decompositions of p-adic cohomology theories analogous to the Hodge decomposition, hence the name p-adic Hodge theory. Further developments were inspired by properties of p-adic Galois representations arising from the √©tale cohomology of varieties. Jean-Marc Fontaine introduced many of the basic concepts of the field. General classification of p-adic representations Let K be a local field with residue field k of characteristic p. In this article, a p-adic representation of K (or of GK, the absolute Galois group of K) will be a continuous representation œÅ : GK‚Üí GL(V), where V is a finite-dimensional vector space over Qp. The collection of all p-adic representations of K form an abelian category denoted \\\\mathrm{Rep}_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}(K) in this article. p-adic Hodge theory provides subcollections of p-adic representations based on how nice they are, and also provides faithful functors to categories of linear algebraic objects that are easier to study. The basic classification is as follows: :\\\\operatorname{Rep}_\\\\mathrm{cris}(K)\\\\subsetneq\\\\operatorname{Rep}_{st}(K) \\\\subsetneq \\\\operatorname{Rep}_{dR}(K)\\\\subsetneq \\\\operatorname{Rep}_{HT}(K) \\\\subsetneq \\\\operatorname{Rep}_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}(K) where each collection is a full subcategory properly contained in the next. In order, these are the categories of crystalline representations, semistable representations, de Rham representations, Hodge‚ÄìTate representations, and all p-adic representations. In addition, two other categories of representations can be introduced, the potentially crystalline representations Reppcris(K) and the potentially semistable representations Reppst(K). The latter strictly contains the former which in turn generally strictly contains Repcris(K); additionally, Reppst(K) generally strictly contains Repst(K), and is contained in RepdR(K) (with equality when the residue field of K is finite, a statement called the p-adic monodromy theorem). Period rings and comparison isomorphisms in arithmetic geometry The general strategy of p-adic Hodge theory, introduced by Fontaine, is to construct certain so-called period ringsThese rings depend on the local field K in question, but this relation is usually dropped from the notation. such as BdR, Bst, Bcris, and BHT which have both an action by GK and some linear algebraic structure and to consider so-called Dieudonn√© modules :D_B(V)=(B\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}V)^{G_K} (where B is a period ring, and V is a p-adic representation) which no longer have a GK-action, but are endowed with linear algebraic structures inherited from the ring B. In particular, they are vector spaces over the fixed field E:=B^{G_K}.For B = BHT, BdR, Bst, and Bcris, B^{G_K} is K, K, K0, and K0, respectively, where K0 = Frac(W(k)), the fraction field of the Witt vectors of k. This construction fits into the formalism of B-admissible representations introduced by Fontaine. For a period ring like the aforementioned ones B‚àó (for ‚àó = HT, dR, st, cris), the category of p-adic representations Rep‚àó(K) mentioned above is the category of B‚àó-admissible ones, i.e. those p-adic representations V for which :\\\\dim_ED_{B_\\\\ast}(V)=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}V or, equivalently, the comparison morphism :\\\\alpha_V:B_\\\\ast\\\\otimes_ED_{B_\\\\ast}(V)\\\\longrightarrow B_\\\\ast \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}V is an isomorphism. This formalism (and the name period ring) grew out of a few results and conjectures regarding comparison isomorphisms in arithmetic and complex geometry: *If X is a proper smooth scheme over C, there is a classical comparison isomorphism between the algebraic de Rham cohomology of X over C and the singular cohomology of X(C) ::H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/\\\\mathbf{C})\\\\cong H^\\\\ast(X(\\\\mathbf{C}),\\\\mathbf{Q})\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\mathbf{C}. :This isomorphism can be obtained by considering a pairing obtained by integrating differential forms in the algebraic de Rham cohomology over cycles in the singular cohomology. The result of such an integration is called a period and is generally a complex number. This explains why the singular cohomology must be tensored to C, and from this point of view, C can be said to contain all the periods necessary to compare algebraic de Rham cohomology with singular cohomology, and could hence be called a period ring in this situation. *In the mid sixties, Tate conjecturedSee that a similar isomorphism should hold for proper smooth schemes X over K between algebraic de Rham cohomology and p-adic √©tale cohomology (the Hodge‚ÄìTate conjecture, also called CHT). Specifically, let CK be the completion of an algebraic closure of K, let CK(i) denote CK where the action of GK is via g¬∑z = œá(g)ig¬∑z (where œá is the p-adic cyclotomic character, and i is an integer), and let B_{\\\\mathrm{HT}}:=\\\\oplus_{i\\\\in\\\\mathbf{Z}}\\\\mathbf{C}_K(i). Then there is a functorial isomorphism ::B_{\\\\mathrm{HT}}\\\\otimes_K\\\\mathrm{gr}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\\\\cong B_{\\\\mathrm{HT}}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\acute{e}t}}(X\\\\times_K\\\\overline{K},\\\\mathbf{Q}_p) :of graded vector spaces with GK-action (the de Rham cohomology is equipped with the Hodge filtration, and \\\\mathrm{gr}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}} is its associated graded). This conjecture was proved by Gerd Faltings in the late eighties after partial results by several other mathematicians (including Tate himself). *For an abelian variety X with good reduction over a p-adic field K, Alexander Grothendieck reformulated a theorem of Tate's to say that the crystalline cohomology H1(X/W(k)) ‚äó Qp of the special fiber (with the Frobenius endomorphism on this group and the Hodge filtration on this group tensored with K) and the p-adic √©tale cohomology H1(X,Qp) (with the action of the Galois group of K) contained the same information. Both are equivalent to the p-divisible group associated to X, up to isogeny. Grothendieck conjectured that there should be a way to go directly from p-adic √©tale cohomology to crystalline cohomology (and back), for all varieties with good reduction over p-adic fields. This suggested relation became known as the mysterious functor. To improve the Hodge‚ÄìTate conjecture to one involving the de Rham cohomology (not just its associated graded), Fontaine constructed a filtered ring BdR whose associated graded is BHT and conjectured, Conjecture A.6 the following (called CdR) for any smooth proper scheme X over K :B_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}\\\\otimes_KH^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\\\\cong B_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\acute{e}t}}(X\\\\times_K\\\\overline{K},\\\\mathbf{Q}_p) as filtered vector spaces with GK-action. In this way, BdR could be said to contain all (p-adic) periods required to compare algebraic de Rham cohomology with p-adic √©tale cohomology, just as the complex numbers above were used with the comparison with singular cohomology. This is where BdR obtains its name of ring of p-adic periods. Similarly, to formulate a conjecture explaining Grothendieck's mysterious functor, Fontaine introduced a ring Bcris with GK- action, a \\"Frobenius\\" œÜ, and a filtration after extending scalars from K0 to K. He conjectured, Conjecture A.11 the following (called Ccris) for any smooth proper scheme X over K with good reduction :B_{\\\\mathrm{cris}}\\\\otimes_{K_0}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\\\\cong B_{\\\\mathrm{cris}}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\acute{e}t}}(X\\\\times_K\\\\overline{K},\\\\mathbf{Q}_p) as vector spaces with œÜ-action, GK-action, and filtration after extending scalars to K (here H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K) is given its structure as a K0-vector space with œÜ-action given by its comparison with crystalline cohomology). Both the CdR and the Ccris conjectures were proved by Faltings. Upon comparing these two conjectures with the notion of B‚àó-admissible representations above, it is seen that if X is a proper smooth scheme over K (with good reduction) and V is the p-adic Galois representation obtained as is its ith p-adic √©tale cohomology group, then :D_{B_\\\\ast}(V)=H^i_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K). In other words, the Dieudonn√© modules should be thought of as giving the other cohomologies related to V. In the late eighties, Fontaine and Uwe Jannsen formulated another comparison isomorphism conjecture, Cst, this time allowing X to have semi-stable reduction. Fontaine constructed, Expos√© II, section 3 a ring Bst with GK- action, a \\"Frobenius\\" œÜ, a filtration after extending scalars from K0 to K (and fixing an extension of the p-adic logarithm), and a \\"monodromy operator\\" N. When X has semi-stable reduction, the de Rham cohomology can be equipped with the œÜ-action and a monodromy operator by its comparison with the log- crystalline cohomology first introduced by Osamu Hyodo. The conjecture then states that :B_{\\\\mathrm{st}}\\\\otimes_{K_0}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\\\\cong B_{\\\\mathrm{st}}\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Q}_p}H^\\\\ast_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\acute{e}t}}(X\\\\times_K\\\\overline{K},\\\\mathbf{Q}_p) as vector spaces with œÜ-action, GK-action, filtration after extending scalars to K, and monodromy operator N. This conjecture was proved in the late nineties by Takeshi Tsuji.

Flavius Antiochianus was from a family of Greek descent from Antioch, Syria. The identity of his mother is unknown; however, his father was the Flavius Antiochianus, praetorian prefect who served as a Prefect and a leader of a Cohort in Germania Superior in 211, and subsequently in Mauretania Caesariensis, returning to Rome to serve as a Praetorian prefect in 221 under the emperor Elagabalus. The younger Antiochianus married a prominent and wealthy noblewoman, Pomponia Ummidia, sister of the Senator Pomponius Bassus. She was of Italian and Pontian Greek ancestry and a descendant of the former Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty. Following their marriage, they lived at her large estate in Pisidia. Inscriptions have been found there with Antiochianus and Pomponia Ummidia named as the owners. It is unknown whether they had any children. Sometime in 268-270, in the reign of Claudius Gothicus, Antiochianus served as a suffect consulJones, A. H. M.; Martindale, J. R.; Morris, J, The Prosopography of the later Roman Empire, Vol. I, AD 260-395 (1971), pg. 70 and as a Praefectus urbi. In 270 under Aurelian, he served a second ordinary consulship with the Emperor, and as a Praefectus urbi between 271-272 and then again 274. There is a possibility that during his second consulship, Antiochianus may have been responsible for the construction of the Balineum Antiochiani, one of the ancient baths (thermae) in Rome.

In the game, players assume the role of the titular ninja to fight against monsters coming from a time portal in order to face against an entity known as Undertaker and rescue his companion Aska. Co-designed by Takashi Shichijo and mangaka Go Nagai, the title was created by most of the same team that worked on previous projects at Almanic such as E.V.O.: Search for Eden. It was met with mixed reception from critics since its release.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Shien's Revenge is a rail shooter game played from a first-person where movement is automatically controlled horizontally or vertically, as players assume the role of the titular ninja through six stages, each with a boss at the end stage that must be fought before progressing any further, in an effort to defeat an evil entity known as Undertaker and rescue his companion Aska as the main objective.Shien's Revenge instruction booklet (Super Nintendo Entertainment System, US) Prior to the main game, players can practice their skills by choosing \\"training mode\\" at the title screen. During gameplay, use long-range shurikens or a close-range kunai as weapons to fight various enemies or block incoming attacks that appear on the playfield. Players can also pick up power-ups like rapid fire and magic scrolls when enemies are defeated; the use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything onscreen. A set of candles represents Shien's life meter and the game is over once it is depleted, though players have the option to continue playing a limited number of times. The SNES Mouse or the Super Scope can be used as optional controllers and players can resume progress via a password system.  Synopsis  Shien and Aska are a pair of highly skilled ninjas fighting in a bloody civil war. After killing hundreds of enemies and emerging victorius, monsters suddenly appeared from a time portal and kidnap Aska. The mastermind is a mysterious force only known as the Undertaker and Shien, now alone, must travel through the time portal to defeat the unknown evil entity and rescue his companion Aska, while facing monsters on his way that emerge from portal.  Development and release  Shien's Revenge was developed, with additional support from Bee Media and Shuna, by most of the same team that worked on previous projects at Almanic Corporation such as E.V.O.: Search for Eden, with both Takashi Shichijo and mangaka Go Nagai acting as co-designers, serving as the debut of Nagai in the video game industry creating bosses. Hiromitsu Shioya and Toshiyuki Mori served as programmers, while Hidetoshi Fujioka, Ken Ishikawa and Nanako Geya acted as artists. The plot was written by Tatsuhiko Dan, with composers Akihiko Mori, Michiya Hirasawa and Tsukushi \\"Tukushi\\" Sasaki scoring the soundtrack. Other members also collaborated in its making. The game was first released by Dynamic Planning in Japan on April 8, 1994 and later in North America by Vic Tokai on October of the same year.  Reception  Shien's Revenge was rated the score of 74% by Game Players. According to Electronic Gaming Monthly, the game has \\"a great concept and the mouse interface is totally cool\\", but it \\"can get repetitive after few levels of the same action\\". GamePro remarked that the gameplay concept is unique, but suffers from poor design and difficult controls, even when using the SNES mouse. They concluded that \\"you want to like SR because it throws something fresh into the hack-n-slash ring. Vic Tokai gets credit for a good try. Unfortunately, the game play problems put up too much of a wall, and ultimately Shien doesn't get around it.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Shien's Revenge at GameFAQs * Shien's Revenge at Giant Bomb * Shien's Revenge at MobyGames Category:1994 video games Category:Givro games Category:Light gun games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Rail shooters Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Vic Tokai games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Akihiko Mori ","title":"Shien's Revenge"},{"id":"26086918","text":"Big Butte Springs are natural springs located near the south fork of Big Butte Creek in Jackson County, Oregon, about north of Medford.

Combat Outpost Keating was a small American military outpost in Nurestan Province, in Afghanistan. After an attack on October 3, 2009, where the base was nearly overrun, and 8 Americans and 4 Afghans defenders were killed, the base was abandoned. Two Americans, Staff Sergeants Clinton L. Romesha and Ty Carter were awarded the Medal of Honor for their role in defending the base. The U.S. soldiers killed in the battle were: Justin T.

Amy Davidson Sorkin, writing in The New Yorker, tried to answer the question why the base had not been moved, when it was found to be unsuitable. She noted two claims the military put forward in its report: first, the resources to relocate the base had not been available because the brigade was concentrating on guarding a village that Hamid Karzai, president of Afghanistan, considered strategically important. Second, the search for Bowe Bergdahl, in June 2009, had used up so many resources none were available to address the base's unsuitable location.  Film & Television  In May 2016 CBS News profiled Staff Sergeant Romesha, after he published an account of his experiences at the base, entitled Red Platoon: A True Story of American Valor. Romesha was critical of the choice of site for the base, describing it as \\"like being in a fishbowl or fighting from the bottom of a paper cup.\\" On November 9, 2018, the Netflix series Medal of Honor (documentary) featured two separate episodes for both Clinton Romesha and Ty M.Carter's personal accounts of the events that took place at COP Keating during the Battle of Kamdesh.

The name is derived from Greek monos, \\"single\\", and Latin fenestra, \\"window\\". The concept was inspired by the discovery of Darwinopterus, a species combining a pterodactyloid-type skull with a more basal build of the remainder of the body. The Darwinoptera, a primitive subgroup of monofenestratans showing this transitional anatomy, was also named for Darwinopterus and defined as all descendants of its common ancestor with Pterorhynchus. The earliest known monofenestrate fossils have been found in the Stonesfield Slate formation of the United Kingdom, which dates to the Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic, dated to about 166 million years ago.

Aerotech provides information about new aerospace technology and developments and also includes features on noteworthy people, and businesses that affect the aerospace community. Their primary goal is to inform their readers about events that have a direct effect on them, their jobs and their companies. Aerotech has offices in California, Arizona and Nevada. History Blue Angels Aerotech News and Review, Inc. was founded by Paul and Lisa Kinison in 1986. In February of that year, the first edition of Antelope Valley Aerospace ‚Äî now Aerotech News and Review ‚Äî hit the newsstands. When the first issues hit the stands, the response from readers and advertisers was tremendous. In June 1987, the name was changed to Aerotech News and Review to reflect a more professional readership and growing service area. In August 1989, Aerotech published its first single-focus, magazine-style, special edition that covered the first flight of the B-2 stealth bomber, a history of Northrop and an overview of flying wings of the past. Since then Aerotech has published several other magazine-style issues focusing on specific topics too lengthy to cover in newspaper-fashion, with military air show publications being a favorite. In 1990, the company was awarded the contract to publish its first military newspaper, the Edwards Air Force Base Desert Wings. A highlight in the company's history was when they acquired the contract for the Thunderbolt, a publication for Luke Air Force Base, AZ, which had been held by the prior publisher for 30 years. In 2009, the company launched its multimedia division. This new addition has allowed Aerotech News and Review to remain stable while many other newspaper publishing companies have had to close to their doors. Today, Aerotech News and Review, Inc. publishes a total of five military and defense newspapers.

The highways connects through Dunlap, Pikeville, Crossville, and Jamestown. Throughout its length, US 127 straddles the line between East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee. Route description Hamilton County US 127 begins in Red Bank at an interchange between US 27 (SR 27/SR 29) and SR 8 (Dayton Boulevard), with US 127 heading northwest, along with SR 8 and SR 27 as its hidden, or secret, companions to pass through the northern portion of Chattanooga as a six-lane undivided highway known as Signal Mountain Road. The highway passes through industrial areas for a couple of miles, where SR 27 splits off along Suck Creek Road, before leaving the Chattanooga city limits and ascending onto the Cumberland Plateau as a two-lane highway. US 127/SR 8 passes through the towns of Signal Mountain, Walden, and Fairmount before entering Sequatchie County. Sequatchie County Businesses along Rankin Avenue (US 127/SR 8/SR 28) in downtown Dunlap, Tennessee US 127/SR 8 passes through the Lone Oak community before descending into the Sequatchie Valley and passing through farmland. The highway passes through Center Point, where it meets SR 283 and crosses the Sequatchie River, to enter Dunlap and has a Y-intersection with SR 28, with that designation joining US 127 for its remainder in the state. US 127/SR 8/SR 28 passes northeast directly through downtown along Rankin Avenue to have an interchange with SR 111 after passing through some neighborhoods. Here SR 8 becomes signed and splits off along SR 111 north while US 127/SR 28 leaves Dunlap to head through rural farmland for the next several miles to cross into Bledsoe County. From Dunlap northward, US 127 parallels the Sequatchie River. Bledsoe County US 127 and SR 28 near Lees Station The highway now passes through Palio, Lusk, and Lees Station before entering Pikeville at an intersection with SR 30. They then run concurrently to bypass downtown before splitting off to the west; US 127/SR 28 continues north through farmland to pass through Cold Spring and Melvine before pulling away from the Sequatchie River and ascending back onto the Cumberland Plateau and entering Cumberland County. Cumberland County View along Main Street (US 127/SR 28) in Crossville, Tennessee, at its intersection with Lantana Road (US 70/SR 1/SR 101) US 127/SR 28 immediately has an intersection with Vandever Road, which is a connector to SR 282 and Lake Tansi Village. The highways then goes through more farmland before passing by Cumberland Mountain State Park and an intersection with SR 419. The highway now passes through Cumberland Homesteads, where it has a Y-intersection with SR 68, and US 127/SR 28 turns northeast to enter Crossville. US 127/SR 28 intersects SR 392 (a beltway around downtown) before entering downtown and an intersection with US 70/SR 1/SR 101. It then passes through downtown before widening to four lanes and junctioning with SR 298. US 127/SR 28 then has an intersection with US 70N/SR 24 before going through Crossville's main business district and crossing the Obed River and coming to an interchange with I-40 (exit 317). US 127/SR 28 then leaves Crossville, narrowing to two lanes, and continuing north through more farmland. It then crosses into Fentress County via a couple of sharp switchbacks, in order to negotiate a bridge over Clear Creek. Fentress County The intersection of US127 and SR 62 in Clarkrange US 127/SR 28 then goes through more farmland before entering Clarkrange to an intersection with SR 62. US 127/SR 28 then passes through Clarkrange before an intersection with SR 85 and entering Grimsley.

Pickett County The highway winds it way through rural areas for several miles to intersect with SR 325, and then SR 295, before passing through Chanute and entering Static, intersecting both Kentucky Route 1076 and SR 111 immediately before crossing the state line into Kentucky; SR 28 ends there and US 127 continues into Kentucky towards the town of Albany. History The former alignment of US 127 (Main Street) at SR 52 in downtown Jamestown US 127's current alignment was signed solely as SR 28 until the US 127 corridor's southern terminus was relocated to Chattanooga when the US route was extended south from Cincinnati, Ohio. From 1958 until the 2010s, US 127‚Äôs southern terminus was originally located in downtown Chattanooga, where it intersected US 41 during that route‚Äôs concurrency with US 76. In 1987, the entire alignment of US 127 in Tennessee and Kentucky became the main route for the first annual 127 Corridor Sale. The yard sale route has since extended into other areas along US 127 into Ohio, as well as varied state highways in southern Hamilton County, and into northwest Georgia and northeast Alabama. The tradition continues until this day, and this year's yard sale will be the 43rd annual one.

It grows alongside the related white fig in the northern part of its range. They differ with narrower leaves, almost lanceolate in shape. Common names in Australia include white fig, sour fig, deciduous fig and banyan. A large example can be seen north of Murwillumbah beside the old Pacific Highway,http://www.tweed.nsw.gov.au/PlanningDocs/pdfs/tpo/tpo1990SignificantTrees.htm not far from the state border with Queensland.  Habitat and range  It grows as far south as the Clarence River, New South Wales, and up through Queensland, Torres Strait, Northern Territory, Western Australia and parts of South East Asia. It is often seen on alluvial soil in riverine rainforest.  Description  It is a large tree in excess of 30 metres tall, with a trunk diameter exceeding 1.8 metres. It can be semideciduous. Heavily buttressed at the base. The bark is smooth and grey with various bumps and lenticels on the trunk. Small branches smooth, but with scars of leaf stipules. Leaves form with the stipules, and they are shed when the leaf develops.Floyd, A. G., Rainforest Trees of Mainland South-eastern Australia, Inkata Press 2008, page 234  Leaves  Alternate on the stem, 5 to 20 cm long, 2.5 to 6 cm wide. Ovate lanceolate in shape, which contrasts to the broader leaves of the white fig. Leaves thin, shiny green above, duller paler green below. Leaves with a short but noticeable tip, often curling to one side. Leaf base somewhat rounded. Leaf stalks narrow and long, 2 to 5 cm in length.  Venation  Leaf veins prominent, raised and evident on both sides of the leaf. Net veins attractive in pattern and shape near the leaf edge. 8 to 10 lateral veins, creamy green at around 60 degrees to the mid vein.  Reproduction  Flowers form within a receptacle, a syconium. Flowers pollinated by fig wasps within the fig. The mature fig changes to a white, pinkish or brown colour with red spots, 10 mm in diameter, almost stalkless on the stem. Fruit ripe in Australia mostly June to August, or at all times during the year. The figs eaten by a large variety of birds including Australasian figbird, green catbird, Lewin's honeyeater, topknot pigeon and pied currawong. Regeneration is achieved from fresh seed and cuttings. The marcotting technique of propagation is suited to Ficus virens var. sublanceolata.  Uses  Suited to parks and large gardens as an ornamental tree. Often seen planted in Australian parks and botanic gardens. The timber is of no commercial use.

Chaos Walking is a young adult science fiction series written by American-British novelist Patrick Ness. It's set in a dystopian world where all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise. The series is named after a line in the first book: \\"The Noise is a man unfiltered, and without a filter, a man is just chaos walking.\\" The series consists of a trilogy of novels and three short stories. The three novels feature two adolescents, Todd Hewitt and Viola Eade, who encounter various moral issues and high stakes as the planet around them erupts into war. The Knife of Never Letting Go (2008) begins with Todd being forced to flee his town after discovering a patch of silence, free of Noise. In the second book, The Ask and the Answer (2009), tensions rise as a civil war between two opposing factions forms, and in the final book, Monsters of Men (2010) the indigenous species of New World rebels against the humans just as a ship full of new settlers is set to arrive on the planet. The series has won almost every major children's fiction award in the UK, including the 2008 Guardian award, the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and the Costa Children's Book Award. Monsters of Men won the Carnegie Medal in 2011. The series has been praised for its handling of themes such as gender politics, redemption, the meaning of war, and the unclear distinction between good and evil, all threaded through its complex, fast-paced narrative. The first novel is narrated entirely by Todd, the second is told through the viewpoints of both Todd and Viola and the third book is narrated by Todd, Viola and The Return.  Conception  Ness claims that the idea for Chaos Walking came from \\"one really serious idea and one fairly stupid idea\\": how information overload affects youth, and how most fictional talking dogs \\"never actually talk like... I think dogs would actually talk\\". Ness planned the series as a trilogy from the start, deciding to theme Knife about flight, Ask about tyranny and Monsters about war. Series The Knife of Never Letting Go The Knife of Never Letting Go begins shortly before Todd Hewitt is to come of age and become a man. In Prentisstown, Todd has been brought up to believe that Noise is a result of a Spackle-created germ that killed all the women and unleashed Noise on the remaining men. After discovering a patch of silence out in the swamp, his surrogate parents immediately tell him that he has to run, leaving him with only a map of New World, a message, and many unanswered questions. He soon discovers the source of the silence: a girl, named Viola. The two must hurry to warn an incoming ship of settlers and escape Aaron, Prentisstown's insane preacher, as Mayor Prentiss prepares an army for war. The Ask and the Answer Following on from the events of the first book, The Ask and the Answer starts with the separation of Todd and Viola as they find out that the Mayor has reached Haven before them. Todd is locked up and forced to work with Davy Prentiss Jr to overlook enslaved Spackle, while Viola undertakes an apprenticeship from a renowned healer, Mistress Coyle. However, Mistress Coyle also leads a terrorist organisation, the Answer, to retaliate against 'President' Prentiss, which drives Viola and Todd apart as they become further involved in the opposing factions. Monsters of Men In the final book of the Chaos Walking trilogy, a world-ending war erupts as three armies march into New Prentisstown. New World is in chaos as the Spackle and the settlers go to war, urged on by Mayor Prentiss and a rebel Spackle, 1017. Todd and Viola refuse to give up on each other or what they believe in, but to survive requires making difficult choices. The protagonists find that their decisions have dire consequences, and the stakes only get higher as all three sides fight for what they believe is right. Themes that were explored in previous books are finally brought to a head: whether redemption is possible, whether the lives of few are worth the lives of many, and what it takes to grow up in a world full of monstrous decisions. Short stories Ness has published three short stories set in the world of Chaos Walking. \\"The New World\\" was first published as a free download on 29 June 2009; \\"The Wide, Wide Sea\\" and \\"Snowscape\\" were published for free online on 16 May 2013. Each story is intended as a companion piece to the novels: \\"The New World\\" is intended to be read after The Knife of Never Letting Go; \\"The Wide, Wide Sea\\" after The Ask and the Answer; and \\"Snowscape\\" after Monsters of Men. The short stories were included in the 2013 UK editions of the novels. The New World \\"The New World\\" is a short prequel to the trilogy, detailing the events that led up to Viola's scout ship crashing into New World. The Wide, Wide Sea A prequel to the novels, \\"The Wide, Wide Sea\\" is set before the Spackle War during the last days of the fishing village Horizon. The story tells of a relationship between a teenage villager and a Spackle. Snowscape \\"Snowscape\\" is set after the events of Monsters of Men and is narrated by Lee. In the story, Lee and Wilf join an exploration party of new settlers traveling to the planet's northern frontier Setting Chaos Walking is set on a planet called New World, which was colonized by a small group of religiously devout settlers from Old World (possibly Earth) twenty three years prior to the beginning of The Knife of Never Letting Go. New World is the home of the native, intelligent Spackle as well as giant sea creatures. New World was originally colonized to make \\"a new way of life, one clean and simple and honest and good\\". In particular, the colonists aimed to establish a church that would leave behind corruption in favor of purity. However, the germ, present in the planet's atmosphere, posed several problems that halted the development of this vision. A second ship convoy, under the assumption that the first did not survive, arrives at New World at the end of Monsters of Men. Prentisstown In the beginning, it is under the assumption that Prentisstown, populated only by males, is the sole human settlement on New World, and that all females were killed by a biological warfare disease during the war against New World's intelligent native species, called the Spackle. However, this is proved false with the revelation of the town's true history. Near the end of book one, it is discovered that all Prentisstown women had been killed in an act of insanity after the Spackle War, fueled by the town mayor (Prentiss) and a deranged priest (Aaron). Men following Prentisstown's mayor originally aimed to take over New World as revenge for being isolated for their crimes, accepting Mayor Prentiss as their absolute leader. As the series concludes countless of Prentiss' followers are killed, effectively cannon fodder in the final apocalyptic war against the Spackle. Countless Spackle, too are killed, though the reader gains far deeper insight into their way of life and organization, mainly thorough the authorial voices of The Sky and The Return. By now war is in Prentiss' hands serving now not so much the aim of revenge for past acts, but the satiation of his megalomaniacal desire for absolute control of the planet. This control, however, comes at the price of absolute knowledge, a Faustian burden that is in the end too great to bear. Haven Being the largest settlement on New World, Haven was the leading developer of technology and research. They had developed a cure for the Noise, and were the last town to be taken over by Prentisstown, to whom they surrendered. At the end of The Knife of Never Letting Go, the town was renamed New Prentisstown, and Mayor Prentiss quickly assumed the role of President. Prior to this, the residents of Haven had captured and kept Spackle as servants, The Burden, who have all been killed, aside from 1017. This spurred the war that took place in the final book, Monsters of Men. Characters * Todd Hewitt: The protagonist of the series. He is forced to flee from Prentisstown after discovering a 'hole' in the Noise. Brought up by his surrogate parents, Ben and Cillian, Todd was kept unaware of Prentisstown's true history until the end of the first book. Throughout the novels, he is faced with difficult moral decisions, and is known as \\"the boy who can't kill.\\" He dies in the last book, though he may be revived. * Viola Eade: The second protagonist of the series. Crash-landed on New World with her parents during a scouting mission sent ahead by a group of new settlers. She meets Todd when he detects her silence (on New World, women have no Noise) and they end up traveling together to warn the incoming settlers about the Mayor's gathering army. She later becomes one of the narrating characters starting from book two. * Manchee: Manchee is Todd's pet dog. A gift from Cillian for Todd's twelfth birthday, his thoughts are audible because of the Noise germ. He is Todd's closest friend, and follows Todd unconditionally after they escape Prentisstown. He tragically dies at the hands of Preacher Aaron. * Ben Moore: Ben is Todd's adoptive father who was a friend of his mother's. He and Cillian raised Todd and helped him escape when he discovered that it was possible to escape the Noise. He later rejoined him and told him and Viola the truth about Prentisstown. He is a great source of hope for Todd, and he ultimately stops him from becoming like the Mayor. Like Mayor Prentiss, he can hear all noise in the world, though he is more controlled. *1017/The Return: A Spackle who grew up domesticated in Haven. He is introduced in The Ask and the Answer. As a captive of The Ask's army, 1017 grows angry and vengeful, directing this hate at Todd (known to him as The Knife) due to Todd's lack of action on his moral beliefs. Later named 'The Return' when he arrives at the Spackle settlement, he eventually gathers a rebellion against the human settlers. *Mayor Prentiss: The series' main antagonist. He is the mastermind behind the takeover, and later becomes self-proclaimed President of New World. He is extremely charismatic and manipulative, often choosing to play mind games instead of resorting to brute force. He learns to control his Noise, and can even use it as a weapon. Despite his cruelties, a running theme throughout the trilogy is whether or not he can be redeemed. He becomes sea monster food after being able to hear all noise in the planet drives him insane. *Mistress Coyle: The leader of the Answer. She sets up a camp away from Haven, committed to removing Mayor Prentiss from power. She enlists Viola's help and shows members of the Answer how to set off homemade bombs. Although she does not resort to torture, she is just as manipulative and calculating as Mayor Prentiss. While she calls herself a freedom fighter, the members of The Ask label her as a terrorist. Despite being the head of an organization with just intentions, she is willing to do anything to end the Mayor's regime, even at the cost of sacrificing lives, including her own. She blows herself up eventually. *Davy Prentiss: Mayor Prentiss' son. He begins as an antagonist, but as the story progresses it is revealed he craves his father's praise and attention, something he rarely receives. He also becomes more friendly with Todd, returning his stolen mother's book. During a standoff between the Mayor and Todd, Davy attempts to intervene but Todd threatens to shoot him unless the Mayor backs down. The Mayor reveals that he would not care anyway, and shoots Davy himself. He dies asking for Todd's forgiveness, revealing that he shot Ben. *The Sky: The leader of the spackle who is able to hear their entire population's noise. He is killed by Mayor Prentiss during the peace talks, conferring his leadership to 1017. * Angharrad: Todd's horse. * Acorn: Davy's horse. Davy Prentiss had an alternate name for her, Deadfall. Reception The Chaos Walking novels have gained largely positive reviews. On the overall series, the Costa Prize Judges said that they were \\"convinced that this is a major achievement in the making\\", while the Guardian stated that \\"I would press Patrick Ness‚Äôs Chaos Walking trilogy urgently on anyone, anyone at all. It is extraordinary\\". In their review of the final book, Publisher's Weekly called the series \\"one of the most important works of young adult science fiction in recent years.\\" Robert Dunbar wrote in The Guardian that the series \\"will almost certainly come to be seen as one of the outstanding literary achievements of the present century, whether viewed as fiction for the young or for a wider readership.\\" The Knife of Never Letting Go was received with near universal praise for its originality and narration from critics such as Ian Chipman from Booklist and Megan Honig from The School Library Journal. It went on to win several awards and recognitions, including the Guardian Award, and the 2008 James Tiptree, Jr. Award.Guardian Children's Fiction Prize The second book was also received well, with praise from Publishers Weekly, Children's Literature and Kirkus Reviews, all noting the excellent plot and cast. It was named as one of \\"the best YA science fiction novels of the year\\" by Publisher's Weekly while Kirkus called the characters \\"heartbreakingly real\\" and praised the questions brought up about \\"the meaning of war and the price of peace.\\" The book won the 2009 Costa children's fiction prize and was recognised widely for its success. The third book, Monsters of Men, has received greatly positive reviews and won the 2011 Carnegie Medal. It was also nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke award for best science fiction novel, only the second time that a young adult novel made it on to the shortlist. All three books have been shortlisted for the Carnegie Book Award.

It is designated as one of the main transport links connecting Central and Southern Europe, tracking through Germany, Austria and Italy. Course and sections From Berlin the line will run to the Central German Metropolitan Region of Halle/Leipzig, to Erfurt and to Southern Germany at Nuremberg, Ingolstadt and Munich. Crossing the border with Austria, it will continue through the state of Tyrol along Kufstein, W√∂rgl and the capital Innsbruck. It will enter Italian South Tyrol, passing Franzensfeste and Bolzano, run through Northeast Italy via Verona and Bologna, through Central Italy along Florence and Rome, and reach Southern Italy at Naples and finally shall ferry over to Messina and Palermo on Sicily. Germany Two ICE 3-trains running on the Nuremberg‚ÄìMunich high-speed railway line, parallel to the BAB 9 near Greding The corridor begins at Berlin Hauptbahnhof opened in 2006 and runs via the rebuilt Anhalt Railway (up to Bitterfeld) and Dessau‚ÄìLeipzig railway to Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. The line shall continue to Erfurt Hauptbahnhof on the Erfurt‚ÄìLeipzig/Halle high-speed railway, which opened in December 2015. Likewise, the southern continuation of this route along the Nuremberg‚ÄìErfurt high-speed railway opened in December 2017. In the meantime, service is provided by tilting ICE T trains running on sections of the Leipzig‚ÄìGro√ükorbetha railway, the Thuringian Railway, and the winding Saal Railway via Jena Paradies station, bypassing Erfurt on their way from Leipzig to N√ºrnberg Hauptbahnhof. From Saalfeld station they cross the Rennsteig ridge of the Franconian Forest via the Leipzig‚ÄìProbstzella railway and the Franconian Forest Railway and continue along the Bamberg-Hof railway (from Hochstadt-Marktzeuln) and the Nuremberg‚ÄìBamberg railway Further to the south, the corridor runs via the Nuremberg‚ÄìMunich high-speed railway line opened in 2006 to M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof passing Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof.

Finally the Rosenheim‚ÄìKufstein railway runs to the Austrian border and Kufstein station. Austria Concrete shell for the New Lower Inn Valley railway The heart of the Austrian section is the New Lower Inn Valley railway through the Tyrolean Unterland region. In particular the section between W√∂rgl and Baumkirchen is the most congested line of the whole TEN- network, a result of the Austrian national east-west traffic and the international north-south traffic sharing the same line. The largest section from Kundl to Baumkirchen is already completed and in operation since December 2012. The shorter section between Kundl and Kufstein (or Brannenburg in Bavaria), including a W√∂rgl bypass, is being planned. The Austrian section trains will be able to operate at up to . At the Baumkirchen rail hub, new high-speed curves link with the Innsbruck bypass including the Inn Valley tunnel (German: Inntaltunnel), which is already used by freight trains, but still needs to be upgraded for passengers and connected with the existing Lower Inn Valley railway line for trains calling at Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof. The Inn Valley tunnel will connect directly with the future Brenner Base Tunnel () bypassing the existing Brenner Railway across the Alpine divide up to the southern portal at Franzensfeste in South Tyrol, Italy. Construction of the main bore on the Austrian side began on 19 March 2015. The combined Inn Valley and Brenner Base tunnels will be the longest railway tunnel in the world (). Italy Florence‚ÄìRome high-speed line near Arezzo From the southern portal of the Brenner Base Tunnel at Franzensfeste, an upgrade of the long Brenner Railway section to Verona Porta Nuova is planned, bypassing Brixen and Bolzano/Bozen.

Fins can provide lateral lift opposed to the water and stabilize the board's trajectory, allowing the surfer to control direction by varying their side-to-side weight distribution. The introduction of fins in the 1930s revolutionized surfing and board design. Surfboard fins may be arrayed in different numbers and configurations, and many different shapes, sizes, and materials are and have been made and used. History Historically, surfboards had no fins; some amount of control was achieved through convex hulls and the surfer dragging a foot in the water. A common problem with these early boards was \\"sliding ass\\", in which the tail would slip sideways, usually causing a wipeout. The first fixed fin was introduced by surfing pioneer Tom Blake in 1935. In Waikiki, Blake attached a long, deep metal keel from an abandoned speedboat to his surfboard, and was immediately impressed with the results. Around 1936, Woody Brown independently added a fixed fin to his second surfboard design in San Diego, which further popularized the feature. The stability and control fins allowed revolutionized the sport, though many surfers avoided them for several years; evidently, they were thought dangerous. The feature grew more common in the mid-1940s and became the universal industry standard in the 1950s. Experimentation with fin design and configuration increased after 1966 with the popularization of shortboards. Parallel double fins, first introduced in the 1940s by Bob Simmons, became periodically popular. In 1980, Simon Anderson introduced the three-fin \\"Thruster\\" design, which has since become standard. Configurations In surfing, there are two major types of (typically stationary) surfboard fins (hydrofoils), and a host of illustrative issues. Both a skeg and \\"rail fins\\" stabilize the motion of the surfboard. They also contribute to the desired effect of converting the (kinetic energy) push of the sloped wave face combined with the rider's mass on the sloped wave face (potential energy) into redirected energy ‚Äì lift (lift (physics)) ‚Äì the surfer deflects his surfboard and fins off the water of the wave face (and/or vice versa) to make forward progress across the wave face, or \\"down the line,\\" that is, parallel to the wave crest and beach ‚Äì riding parallel to the crest (perpendicular to the pull of gravity down the wave's slope) in this way is known as \\"trimming.\\" Lift (aka \\"drive\\") from the board and its fin(s) is what enables all maneuvers in surfing. A \\"skeg\\" (an upright, streamlined, often raked keel) typically denotes one centrally-mounted stabilizer foil mounted perpendicularly to the riding surface, at the rear of the surfboard. Smaller surfboard fins mounted near the edge (or \\"rail\\") of the surfboard are known as \\"rail fins\\" and are seen in multi-fin arrangements (often in combination with a similarly-sized central fin further back on the board). Rail fins enable high-performance surfing, and are most often \\"single-foiled,\\" with one flat side and one \\"foiled\\" side, as seen on an airfoil, for greater lift. A fin configuration with fins near the edge of the board stabilizes and contributes lift during turning maneuvers, which contributes to the board's ability to \\"hold\\" during turning maneuvers. Rail fins are often seen in addition to a central fin, but can be used without a central fin as well. Some of the most popular multi-fin configurations use two rail fins (a \\"twin-fin\\"), two rail fins plus a similar-sized central fin mounted further back (e.g. a \\"Thruster\\"), or four fins (a \\"quad\\"). Rail fins are more or less engaged by the rider's heel and toes as they lean in the desired direction of their turn. As the rider does so, an \\"inside\\" rail fin sinks deeper and its angle of attack is increased, as is its lift-induced drag. Rail fins also add lift (known as \\"drive\\") in trim and with greater holding ability, enable steeper wave faces to be ridden and higher speed \\"down the line.\\" Rail fins are typically \\"toed-in,\\" that is, the leading edge of the fins are oriented toward the centerline of the surfboard, which decreases the angle of attack in trim, which makes it easier to initiate turns. \\"Toeing in\\" rail fins also adds drag on the \\"outside\\" fin, as its angle of attack is negative during trim or in a turn. These combined factors of toed-in rail fins cause several issues: drag on a toed-in outside rail fin can slow the board down in trim, but it can also give a braking effect during turns that is useful. The inside rail fin (and the board itself) can be \\"pumped,\\" attacked and re-attacked, by swerving up and down the face, causing acceleration down the line, or similarly pumped to achieve a desired trajectory through a multi-stage turn. At higher speeds, the drag off toed-in rail fins can cause surfboards to oscillate and become unstable ‚Äì a phenomenon known as \\"speed wobbles\\". Most surfboards intended for larger waves are longer (to increase hull speed for paddling, wave-catching, and surfing), and as most shapers orient the rail fins toward the nose of the board, a longer board inherently results in reduced toe-in of rail fins, therefore less negative angle of attack, less oscillation, greater stability, and higher speeds. Rail fins also typically have some degree of \\"cant,\\" that is, are tilted out toward the rail they are adjacent to. This is a significant additional factor in lift at various attitudes, drag, and performance, as are the variables of other foils ‚Äì including flexibility, thickness, and planform. Rail fins evolved into being and surged into popularity as riders (Simon Anderson, most famously) sought a solution to two major performance issues of a central \\"single\\" fin ‚Äì both related to engagement of the foil: For one, a centrally-mounted fin is tilted up out of the water as the board is leaned over, and thus it loses more and more of its lift as the lean angle increases ‚Äì if the lean angle is acute enough, the fin's tip can be the only area left in the water; the tip may then rapidly stall and, having lost its lift, become disengaged from the water, leaving the board's bottom as the only control surface still operating. Before rail fins became (extremely) popular, this tendency of \\"single fins\\" led to riders \\"nursing\\" turns ‚Äì this tendency was a significant limiting factor on performance. The enhanced hold offered by rail fins during turning led to more types of maneuvers being possible. The other major issue leading to rail fins' use is the fact that a rider can use the lift near the rail to increase speed and performance on smaller waves due to the above effects and abilities of these foils. Conventional statics fins suffer from the inability to have a camber and attack angle always adapted to variations trajectories. The angles given to rail fins are a compromise generating straight drag and oppositions in maneuvers. The center fin merit of being able to adjust its suction face and its angle with the direction of the turn to avoid the hydrodynamic stall. The fin camber and attack angle needed to accord to the different phases of trajectory. When turning left or right the fins need to adjust the camber and attack angles to avoid hydrodynamic stall, so the Adaptive Dynamic Attack & Camber system (ADAC)ADAC system surf fins|url=http://www.mecaflux.com/en/surf%20fin.htm brought a solution to this hydrodynamic problem. This surf fin technology introduced adaptable structures with variable geometry inspired by aeronautics and biomimetic in the surf. In Windsurfing, a derivative of traditional surfing, skegs are also often used as a central stabilizing fin (hydrofoil) located at the rear of the board. A windsurfer's skeg also has the effect of producing lift, which allows the rider to direct the craft laterally against the lift the sail (itself an airfoil) produces. The skeg has undergone numerous phases of development and, as with other foils, its design is determined by the balance of the pressures it experiences in use, including lift, drag (physics), ventilation and stall (flight). Types Glass on fins\\"Glass on Fins\\" The Surfing Handbook. Web. 20 January 2010 are fins that are permanently connected to the surfboard through fiberglass. This type of fin was mainly used on older model surfboards. Glass on fins are broken easily and are hard to repair. You rarely see these types of fins today because a different type of fin has replaced them. US Box fin FCS/FCS II fin Futures fin Removable Fin Systems\\"Removable Fin Systems\\" The Surfing Handbook. Web. 20 January 2010. The most common types of fins used today, removable fins are surfboard fins that can be unscrewed from the surfboard and be replaced by different fins or be moved about the board for a different setup in maneuverability and stability. In the early '90s, three Australian surfers invented the fin control system (FCS). Since its global release in 1994 FCS has become the industry standard; providing elite athletes and everyday surfers an abundance of fin designs and a platform to change the performance of their surfboard by changing fins. The system also streamlined the surfboard manufacturing process by making it easier to install fins into boards and repair damaged fins. The leading competitor to FCS fins is Futures fins. Using a single larger fin box, the manufacturer claims the fins provide a stronger connection and more closely approximate the feeling of a glass on fin.http://www.futuresfins.com/en-us/fin-school/system Third, there is the US Box system that is still often used for single fin setups.

Production Tom Blake\\"Fins History\\" SURFLINE.COM Global Surf Reports and Forecasts, Live Surf Cams and Coastal Weather. Web. 20 January 2010.(One of surfing most influential fathers) invented the first fin used on a surfboard. Although Blake's first fin was most like attaching a keel from a boat to the bottom of the board, Blake's finding started the development of the fins in use today. From Blake's first fin, people, perhaps most famously Bob Simmons and George Greenough, have modified and invented new types of surfboard fins. Simmons was apparently the first to use more than one fin on a surfboard. Greenough made the fin flexible and took inspiration from the fins of fish(allegedly tuna) and dolphins. Bob Simmons used a twin-keel design on innovative wooden boards of his own design and manufacture in the 9'-10' range, which he rode in large surf at Windansea in California. In the 1970s, multi-fin systems became much more widely used, in competition and by average surfers, as top professionals like Larry Bertlemann and Mark Richards enjoyed competitive success maneuvering shorter boards with twin fins in smaller surf and tighter radius turns. It was not until the 1980s that Simon Anderson invented the popular thruster set-up (three fins ‚Äì two on the rail from the tail end, one center fin up from the tail) which stabilized the board compared to the twin-fin set-up, and provided more control and lifting surfaces in an effective configuration. The design was an immediate competitive success for Anderson, inasmuch as he immediately won two very famous surf contests using \\"thrusters,\\" and the entire surfing world quickly followed his lead. The thruster is the dominant fin configuration to this day, in both recreational and competition surfing. Setups and shapes Single fin The single fin setup is the original fin setup. Single fin setups are common on long boards. They are usually long and wider than other fins, which make the board controllable with only the one fin. Twin Fin The twin fin setup has two smaller fins mounted near the rail. They can be either glassed or screwed in (detachable). This setup allows for extra speed and looser turning. Thruster The most common setup, the \\"thruster\\" is a tri-fin. All the fins are the same size, with two semi- parallel (slightly toed-in, usually, and slightly canted outward, usually) fins mounted near the rails forward of the tail and a middle fin at . 2+1 setup The 2+1 denotes a larger center fin (for reference, larger than a thruster center fin) with 2 small to medium-small fins at a position close to thruster rail fin positions. The \\"sidebites\\" contribute some lift, control, and stability to the board when it is \\"on rail,\\" arcing through turns. Typically, \\"sidebites\\" are removable, so the surfer can take them out for use in smaller waves, which gives less drag and freer turning. The 2+1 is a popular configuration for mid length to long boards. Quad setup The quad setup is four fins, two on each side, in a similar position to the rail fins on a thruster. The fronts are typically larger than the rears but this is not always the case. The rears are nearly always inboard and aft of the fronts. The exact measurements and configuration of the quad set-up can vary pretty widely. This setup is often used in short boards and provides more lift and control surface near the rail. There is no center fin. Twinzer setup The Twinzer is a design by Wil Jobson and similar to the Campbell brothers' \\"Bonzer,\\" the fin set-up is held to be functionally integral and synergistic with the bottom contours of the board, specifically a \\"bat-tail\\" with an integral convex/double-channel. The fin set-up itself is four fins, two on each side, in a similar position to the rail fins on a thruster. The fronts are smaller than the rears, often roughly 1/3 the size, mounted ahead and outboard of the fronts, with ~8 degrees of outward cant, and notably, the fins' trailing edges are behind the leading edges of the main fins. The water coming off the trailing edge of the \\"canards\\" becomes part of the flow \\"behind\\" the main fins. This fact is held to enhance the lift and speed of the set-up, because of the \\"slot effect.\\" The exact measurements and configuration of the twinzer are basically standardized by Jobson, but some variation is seen amongst different builders. Tunnel fin See Tunnel fin. Bonzer The Bonzer is a 3- or 5- array invented by the Campbell brothers in Oxnard, California in the early 1970s for the powerful waves of a well-known wave near their home. The Bonzer array is an approximately 7\\" center fin aft and either two or four delta-shaped fins (\\"runners\\") mounted near the rails in somewhat similar fashion to other rail fins, but they are substantially lower aspect and aggressively canted outward. The Bonzer array is firmly held to be an integral part of the Campbell brothers' overall board design featuring double concave bottom contours out the tail. Diamond Quad The Diamond Quad is a design by John Coby of Noosa Australia. It was first test surfed on 16 July 2011 at Teatree Point Noosa. The purpose of the design was to induce more looseness into longboards. The design features a stabiliser tail fin, two side fins, and a destabiliser fin in the centre, and anterior to, the side fins, called a 'dorsal fin'. The initial test, performed on a 9'6\\" Tolhurst Tuflite, with a retro-fitted slot for the dorsal fin, was extremely successful making the board feel at least 50% looser. After continuous development, the Diamond Quad has seen the tail fin become smaller and the side fins become bigger. The main drive in the Diamond Quad now comes from the side fins. The dorsal fin is small, deep and usually somewhere between 600 and 680 mm forward of the tail (to trailing edge of fin), depending on the length and width of the board. The final 'sweet spot' of the dorsal fin can only be found by surfing and adjusting. Too far a forward placement induces excessive instability and makes the longboard too loose and difficult to control. The fin is progressively moved back in small increments, usually about 5 mm at a time, until a suitable amount of stability and control is achieved. The Diamond Quad also allows a longboard to trim a couple of degrees tighter, ride higher on the wall and be more stable in white water turbulence. Fyn central line The central line configuration comes from optimizations of Dynamic system \\"ADAC\\", conducted in France by jf Iglesias, and applied to surf since 2014 with the brand Fyn. US Patent and first import of the system cames in the US in 2015. Dynamic system \\"ADAC\\" (ref 11) eliminates the need for asymmetric fins antagonists. The central position of fins for more efficient rail supports, it is natural to place the dynamic fins on the center line, to benefit from all the advantages. The configuration on the center line thus increases the force of the rail support, to benefit from the effects of leading edge flaps and adjust the positions of the gaps between the fins (if rear spoiler is mounted USbox) .The configuration on the center line of the dynamic fin has maneuverability and drive the system ADAC and also the effectiveness of the rail support of the central position that was formerly reserved only for singles. (A configuration on the center line with static fins block maneuverability). Dimpled fins 3DFINS feature Golf Ball Dimpled technology. 3DFINS Dimple technology is based on the Golfball dimples. A surfboard fin with dimples creates a turbulent flow a fin without Dimples is more a laminar flow. Turbulent flow has more adhesion so when the surfer starts to turn, the dimpled fin surface delays the flow separation, reducing cavitation (the separation bubble) allowing the foil to maintain performance. When the surfer is turning at high speeds, the turbulent boundary layer helps the flow overcome an adverse pressure gradient and allows the fin to remain attached to the surface longer than it would otherwise. This reduces drag, increases lift and improves overall performance of the fin design ‚Äì a World Tour Proven Innovation that has set the path for 3DFINS as an innovator of Fins. The Dimples are unique to 3DFINS TM (Design Patented, Aust, USA, International Patents Pending). Designed by Australian Surfer/inventor Courtney Potter while working closely with Josh Kerr, Jamie O'Brien and Christian Fletcher and a comprehensive series of Fluid Dynamic testing.  Dimensions and geometry   Sweep ( Rake )  When looking at the sweep or otherwise known as the rake of a fin, is how far the front edge of a fin arcs backward. Rake is the measurement that determines how far back a fin curves in relation to its base. This is what propels the board, the smaller rake fins will offer greater speed and will be more predictable but less ideal for short, fast turns. Large rake fins offer you a \\"squirrelly\\" yet playful experience whilst letting you make tighter turns.  Toe/Splay  Often defined by the manufacture of the board, the toe or splay of a fin system is the angle of which the side fins are in relation to the board's central stinger. Often side fins are referred to as \\"Toed-in\\" with the front of the fin angled towards the middle of the board. This allows water to pressure the outside fins which will ultimately increase responsiveness.  Base/Length  The widest point of a fin is the base, giving the fin strength and is often the part that sits flush with the base of the board once installed. The length of the base will effect the board's responsive behaviours in turns. The longer base creates trajectories for water to propel past, which creates a faster ride. For sharper, more maneuverable fins go for a shorter base.  Foil  Foil is one of the more important aspects of a fin, referring to the shape of the outside and inside faces of the fin, thinnest near the tip of the fin, and thicker near the base. Altering the flow of water over the fin surface has a direct impact on the performance of the fins and board. Your central fin will always be symmetrical and convex on both sides, this is often referred to as \\"50/50\\", this offers even distribution and stability. Outside fins are typically convex on the outside faces and flat or curved inwards on the inside. The flat inside creates a solid balance of control, speed and maneuverability, whilst a curved or concaved inside maximizes lift and minimal drag, more ideal for speed and fluidity.  Flex  The fin's flexibility or lack of flex significantly impacts the way your board reacts, a more flexible fin offers a more playful and fun experience, where a stiff fin will offer greater speed on hollow waves. Higher end fins come with both soft and stiff flex patterns being stiff at the base and softer at the tip.  Height/Depth  This is the measurement from the base of the fin, to the tallest point at the tip. The varying height of fins is designed to change a board's stability and grip through turns. If control and surfing relaxed manner is what is wanted, a taller fin is the way to go; shorter fins do not give the water like taller fins, meaning more experienced riders can maneuver the board more freely.  Cant  Cant is the degree in which the fin sits in relation to the board's base, for example, a fin that is straight up/down has a cant of 90 degrees, this makes the ride faster by carving through the wave more freely. Anything outside the 90 will increase the board's responsive behaviours through turns. Less cant allows for greater acceleration and drive.

Recognized by his slight build, narrow face, and pencil-thin moustache, Jolley appeared some five hundred times on the large or small screen. Early years Isaac Stanford Jolley was born in a circus trailer in Elizabeth, New Jersey, while the circus owned by his father had a three-day stop there. Jolley toured as a child with his father's traveling circus and worked in vaudeville. He was a student of the Edward Clark Academy Theater.  Stage  Jolley first performed on Broadway in 1924 opposite Charles Trowbridge in Sweet Seventeen.  Film roles  Jolley worked in radio until he performed his first uncredited part in the 1935 Bette Davis film, Front Page Woman. He appeared in twenty-five films for Republic Pictures between 1936 and 1954, but he was never under contract to the studio. According to his wife, he never earned more than $100 on any of his multiple film appearances. Appearing in scores of films, mostly Westerns, Jolley was cast in 1940 as Molotoff in Chasing Trouble, with other performers in the comedy/espionage film including western actors Milburn Stone and Tristram Coffin. In 1942, he was cast as Gil Harkness in the western Outlaws of Boulder Pass. In 1944, he was cast as Saladin in the swashbuckling \\"Western\\" set in the Middle East, The Desert Hawk, and as Bart Kern in the Tex Ritter film, Gangsters of the Frontier. In 1946, he portrayed Dr. Blackton in The Crimson Ghost and also did the voice of the undefined title character. In 1948, Jolley was cast as the loan shark Rance Carson in Tex Granger, Midnight Rider of the Plains. In 1949, Jolley appeared as Professor Bryant in King of the Rocket Men. That same year, he was cast as Mark Simmons in Trouble at Melody Mesa. He appeared as Toad Tyler in 1949s Rimfire. In 1950, Jolley was cast as J.B. \\"Dude\\" Dawson in the low-budgeted Republic Pictures film serial, Desperadoes of the West. Also in 1950 he appeared as \\"Snake Willens\\" in the Audie Murphy western Sierra. In 1951, he was cast as Sam Fleming in Oklahoma Justice, with Johnny Mack Brown, with whom he had also appeared in Silver Range, and as Zorol in the Columbia Pictures serial, Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere, starring Judd Holdren as Captain Video. In 1953, he appeared as Ted in the Audie Murphy and Lee Van Cleef film Tumbleweed. That same year, Jolley appeared as Rocky in the western film, Son of Belle Starr, a drama about Starr's son, \\"The Kid\\" or Ed Reed, played by Keith Larsen, who attempts to lead an upright life despite his family background. In 1954, he played the stationmaster in Vermont in the Bing Crosby/Danny Kaye Christmas classic White Christmas. In 1956, Jolley appeared as Henry Longtree in the short film I Killed Wild Bill Hickok. Television roles From 1950 to 1953, Jolley first appeared on television with six castings in different role in the series, The Lone Ranger reuniting him with his Crimson Ghost co-star Clayton Moore. He appeared twice in 1953 in the syndicated western series, The Range Rider. He made two appearances as Parker in Tales of the Texas Rangers, with series stars Willard Parker and Harry Lauter. Jolley guest starred as the henchman Walt, along with Clayton Moore and Darryl Hickman in the 1954 episode \\"Annie Gets Her Man\\" of the syndicated Western, Annie Oakley. He appeared as Sheriff Bascom in the 1954 episode \\"Black Bart\\" of Stories of the Century. In 1958, Jolley appeared on ABC's Walt Disney Presents in the role of Sheriff Adams in the episode \\"Law and Order, Incorporated\\", with Robert Loggia as Elfego Baca. His then 32-year-old son, Stan Jolley, was the art director of the segment. Others in the episode were former child actor Skip Homeier and Raymond Bailey, later the banker Milburn Drysdale of CBS's The Beverly Hillbillies. Jolley soon appeared multiple times on a wide range of other western series, including, The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (three times), The Cisco Kid (ten), Tales of the Texas Rangers (twice), Sergeant Preston of the Yukon (twice), The Roy Rogers Show (three), The Gene Autry Show (four), Sky King (four), Death Valley Days (five), 26 Men (five appearances, again with Tristram Coffin, the series star), Wanted Dead or Alive (two), Bronco (twice), Tales of Wells Fargo (twice), The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (six), Maverick (six), Lawman (six), Cheyenne (seven), Rawhide (five), Wagon Train (ten), The Virginian (two), Daniel Boone (two), Laredo (two), The Big Valley (three), Bonanza (eight), and Gunsmoke (nine). Jolley appeared as the shrewd businessman Phineas Colby in the 1955 episode, \\"California's First Ice Man\\" of the western television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Peter Jeffries (Rhodes Reason) turns to the importation of ice from his native Boston, Massachusetts, rather than exploration of gold, to revive his lost family fortune. Meanwhile, Jeffries is courting Colby's niece, Laura Colby (Donna Drew), who acts as a nurse seeking ice to relieve suffering of her patients in the heat of summer. In 1957, he appeared once on Sugarfoot as \\"The Nighthawk\\", in the episode \\"Reluctant Hero\\". In 1958, he was cast in the episode \\"The Horse Nobody Wanted\\" of the NBC children's western series, Fury, starring Peter Graves and Bobby Diamond. In 1959, he was cast as Beriah Jackson in the episode \\"Contest at Gold Bottom\\" of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, The Alaskans. In 1960, he guest starred as the Indian named Singing Arrow in the series finale, \\"The Search,\\" of the syndicated western, Pony Express, with Grant Sullivan. In 1962, he was cast as The Stranger in the episode \\"Quarantine\\" of the NBC western series, The Tall Man, starring Barry Sullivan, and Clu Gulager. In 1965, Jolley appeared as Enos Scoggins in \\"The Greatest Coward on Earth\\" of the Chuck Connors series, Branded. He had also appeared with Connors on ABC's The Rifleman in one of the last episodes of the series in 1963 in the role of Joe Fogner in \\"Hostages to Fortune\\" (1963). He appeared four times in 1956 in archival footage on the children's western The Gabby Hayes Show. In 1966, Jolley appeared on the show F Troop as Colonel Ferguson in the episode \\"Survival of the Fittest\\". Jolley's last Western roles were in 1976: as (1) a farmer in ABC's The Macahans, the pilot of James Arness's second western series, How the West Was Won, and as (2) a drunkard in the short-lived Tim Matheson and Kurt Russell series The Quest. Jolley's non-western appearances included The Adventures of Superman (twice), Perry Mason (twice), The Untouchables as Pete Laffey in \\"The Man in the Cooler\\", Profiles in Courage in the episode \\"Andrew Johnson\\" (with Walter Matthau in the title role), Man with a Camera as Dr. Ben Todd in \\"The Killer\\", Mr. and Mrs. North as Harry in \\"The Ungrateful Killer\\", and in Johnny Weissmuller's Jungle Jim as Bremer in \\"Voodoo Drums\\". Personal life and legacy Jolley and his wife, Emily (1901‚Äì2003) had two children: Stan Jolley (1926-2012) and Sandra Jolley Carson (1919‚Äì1986). Sandra, originally an Earl Carroll showgirl, was married to actors Forrest Tucker (divorced) and Jack Carson (widowed). Death Jolley died of emphysema in 1978 at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, a son, a daughter, and three granddaughters. His wife died in the same facility in 2003. The Jolleys are interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California.

Etymology The genus name Dardanus refers to the son of Zeus and Electra in Greek mythology, while the species name megistos is the superlative of the Greek word mega, therefore it means the largest. Distribution This species is present in the Indo-Pacific region from East Africa to the South China Sea, Australia and east to Hawaii.iNaturalist Dardanus megistos from Maldives. Video clip Habitat These tropical reef-associated crabs occur in coral reef, lagoons, rocky platforms, sand and seagrass beds, from littoral and subtidal zones to deep waters, at depths up to 50 m. Sealife Base Description Dardanus megistos can reach a body length of about . These large crabs have a bright red body with small white eyespots surrounded by black. Their bodies are covered with long erect coarse hairs of a dark red color. They have a pair of long white primary antennae or antennules, a pair of secondary antennae, stalked green brown eyes and three pairs of mouth appendages. The stalks of the eyes are reddish with a basal white spot. The soft, asymmetrical abdomen is spiral-shaped, useful in keeping in the shell, with a five-piece tail (telson and uropods). Like all decapod crustaceans, they have ten legs. The first pair of legs carries the pincers ( chelipeds). The left plier is bigger than the right one.Sous Les Mers DORIS - Donn√©es d'Observations pour la Reconnaissance et l'Identification de la faune et la flore Subaquatiques Biology The white-spotted hermit crabs are gonochorics, the eggs are carried on the female's abdomen. They also are opportunistic omnivore, mainly feeding on small invertebrates (worms, molluscs, etc.) and they are also reported to feed on holothurians. Commonly these crabs perform a precopulatory courtship ritual. Usually the sperm transfer is indirect. They may live up to 30 years. These crustaceans usually inhabit a large shell of a gastropod, consequently only the cephalothorax and the first three pairs of legs are visible.

It replaced the multiple components of the minimum pension (Minimum Vieillesse) from 1 January 2006. Ordonnance n¬∞ 2004-605 du 24 juin 2004 simplifiant le minimum vieillesse Existing recipients of the minimum pension are not automatically transferred to the ASPA, but may do so on request. In its 2012 annual report, the Service d'Allocation de Solidarit√© aux Personnes √Çg√©es (SASPA), managed by the Caisse des d√©p√¥ts et consignations, counted 70,827 recipients of the ASPA on 31 December 2012 (against 71,490 in 2011). Eligibility To qualify for ASPA, the recipient must live in France or French territory, and meet age and financial need criteria. Lawful residence in France A French citizen must have their main residence on French territory. The allowance is suspended if the recipient moves to another country. A foreign national must also meet at least one of these conditions: * Have held for at least 10 years a residence permit allowing them to work; * Have refugee status; * Be stateless; * Be eligible for protection subsidiaire (subsidiary protection, protection granted to persons who are not classed as refugees, but who still face specific threats in their own country); * Have fought for France; * Be a national of a member state of the European Economic Area or of Switzerland. Minimum age The recipient must be at least 65 years old, except in two special cases for which the criterion is reduced to the minimum legal age of retirement [5] : * Be disabled by at least 50% and be recognized as permanently unfit for work; * Be retired from work on the grounds of disability. Financial need Assets taken into account include all earnings and property, pensions and disability and the (AAH). Family benefits, the allocation of social housing, and military pensions are not taken into account [6] . The annual income limit is adjusted on 1 April each year. [8] . In 2014, the annual income limit is ‚Ç¨9503.89 for a single person, and ‚Ç¨14755.32 for a couple. Value The ASPA provides an income up to the annual income limit (currently ‚Ç¨9,503.89 for a single person, and ‚Ç¨14,755.32 for a couple), taking into account the above assets. ASPA will be upgraded in 2014 as part of French pension reforms. The single person's annual income limit is expected to be increased to ‚Ç¨9,600 in October 2014. The ASPA is transferable and seizable in settlement of debts. Recovery ASPA is conceived of as an advance from the State rather than a grant, and payments can be reclaimed by the State after the person's death if their estate is worth more than ‚Ç¨39,000.

Established in 2015, its area covers approximately . Along with the Mealy Mountains, the park protects a large portion of boreal forest, tundra and more than 50 kilometres of shoreline on the Labrador Sea and Lake Melville. It is the largest national park in eastern Canada. It is inhabited by a variety of wildlife, fish and migratory birds, including the threatened Mealy Mountains woodland caribou herd, and healthy populations of wild atlantic salmon, in decline throughout its range. Other mammals that inhabit this park reserve are wolf packs, black bear, marten and two species of fox. Agreements with the indigenous peoples of the area, including the Innu, Inuit, and NunatuKavut allow for the sharing of various management and planning responsibilities, and the continuation of Indigenous rights in the protected area. Background Parks Canada, the governing and administration body for the national park system, has developed a national systems plan identifying 39 different natural regions it aims to represent. Since the 1970s, the Innu people rejected Parks Canada's efforts in the region. However in 2001, after concluding a framework for a land claim agreement, Innu Nation invited Parks Canada to begin conducting a feasibility study regarding whether a new park should be established in Labrador, which would represent the east coast boreal forest. A steering committee was formed, and they held a series of meetings near Lake Melville. One of the concerns brought up by the area residents was regarding the \\"traditional land uses by Labradorians\\", which include \\"the continuing use of personal cabins, boil-ups (lunch and picnic fires), cutting wood for personal use, gathering medicinal and healing herbs, berry picking, fishing, and hunting, trapping and snaring small game\\". In May 2008, the committee concluded that a park was feasible. The park will start as a reserve due to unresolved land claims negotiations with Innu people in the area. A National Park Reserve is an area that has been set aside with the intention of becoming a national park, pending the settlement of land claims. Until then, they are managed as national parks under the National Parks Act. The park was announced on February 5, 2010 by then Minister of the Environment Jim Prentice in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador. At the same time, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced that a proposed Provincial Waterway Park would also be created. It will be adjacent to Mealy Mountains and will protect the Eagle River watershed. Together, the two parks will protect approximately . The park will be unique because it will allow for traditional Aboriginal activities not permitted in most other parks, such as hunting, trapping, fishing and cutting wood for personal use. However, further development of the land and mining will not be allowed. Larry Innes of The Canadian Boreal Initiative, who was part of the steering committee, said that \\"It‚Äôs a change in policy which really fits the context here. The big breakthrough here is that not only are they creating the largest protected area in Eastern North America. They‚Äôre doing so in a way that fits the uses that local people have put to the place\\". Alex MacDonald of the conservation group Nature Canada said they had been lobbying for the establishment of the park. MacDonald said, \\"Protecting an area this large will maintain vast amounts of habitat ‚Äî river habitats, aquatic ecosystems, the tundra habitat as well as boreal forest areas\\". The federal government renewed its commitment to the park reserve in 2015, proposing \\"Akami‚àíUapishk·µÅ‚àíKakKasuak‚àíMealy Mountains\\" as the name for the country's ninth National Park Reserve. \\"Akami‚àíUapishk·µÅ\\" is the Innu name for the area, meaning White Mountain across, while \\"KakKasuak\\" is the Labrador Inuit word for mountain.Harper Government Announces Creation of a National Park Reserve in the Mealy Mountains of Labrador, Parks Canada news release, July 31, 2015 The National Park Reserve was officially established as Canada‚Äôs 46th national park with the July 31, 2015 signing of a federal/provincial Land Transfer Memorandum of Agreement. The lands were officially transferred to the Canadian federal government by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador on July 10, 2017.

It is common for individuals who are camera-shy to fear public speaking, performing in front of an audience, and having one's picture taken by any type of camera or by video camera. It can be a consequence of shyness itself, which can be related to low self-esteem, anxiety and fear. Shyness can be a result of social anxiety, public self- consciousness, low assertiveness, and introversion. An individual who experiences camera shyness is often in fear of the unexpected or the unknown in social situations, causing them to avoid the camera. In a social situation that is anxiety-inducing, people tend to have behavioral responses that prevent the situation from getting worse. According to Crozier, anxiety can be separated into three elements: cognitions, physiological responses and behavior. An individual walking away or hiding their face is a behavioral response from camera shyness. A physiological response to camera shyness can be shaking or an increase in heart rate. A cognitive response can be how a person remembers a terrible experience with cameras, which results in fear of being photographed or filmed.

The fire is known as the \\"Fuego del Polvor√≠n\\" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today a register marks the location of the fire.Bomberos evocan a h√©roes del Polvor√≠n. Sandra Torres Guzm√°n. La Perla del Sur. Ponce, Puerto Rico. 21 January 2015. Year 322. Issue 1625. Page 10.

In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire.Encyclopedia Puerto Rico. Ponce: Ponce High. Five years after El Polvorin, in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorin lot.

As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now- historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.University of Puerto Rico Law Library. Album de la Clase de 1910: Alta Escuela de Ponce. Ponce High School. 1910. Location The school is located in barrio Tercero. It faces Cristina street to the north and is bounded on the south by Comercio street (PR-133), on the west by Salud street, and on the east by Trujillo street. Its location is only two blocks from Plaza Las Delicias. It is also diagonally across from the Ponce Free School of Music, the old location of Liceo de Ponce (Liceo Ponce√±o), an early 20th-century girls-only school. It is also one block from Teatro La Perla. Construction and appearance The main and most historical of the buildings faces north. In the back of this building is a large yard paved with concrete. This backyard contains several other large school buildings. The main building follows the neoclassical architectural style. The front entry consists of a raised portico and a lobby area. The school library is located on the first floor and the auditorium is on the second floor. At both Eastern and Western sides of the lobby, and at both levels, L-shaped arcaded hallways lead to the classrooms. Two semi-enclosed patios are thus defined between the library-auditorium wing (much higher and wider) and the identical classroom wings facing East and West. Three sets of stairs are symmetrically laid out in the scheme: one of secondary importance at either side of the lobby; the most public one next to side entrances at the L-shaped circulation wings. A third set of stairs faces the patios and is the only one not to connect to the building's basement where more classrooms are found.Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Jorge Rigau, AIA, Form Preparer, Colacion. Inc. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) March 16, 1987. In National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 2. Listing Reference Number 87001310. August 4, 1987. The most continuous side of the E-shaped structure constitutes the front facade; it is articulated to best reflect and express the internal organization in plan. Sophisticated neoclassical details, although integral to the building's public \\"face\\", are not used with such insistence anywhere else on the building, except for the lobby, which includes some mouldings, cornices and relatively simple pilaster inlays. Set back from the street, the front facade is enhanced by two small green parterres adjoining the concrete-iron fence and sidewalk. The elevation includes Doric columns and pilasters running two stories high, identical pediments at each end and an escutcheon-like crowning piece with a clock. The latter is dead center over the entrance portico. Concrete flat roofs, an extended parapet and a wide horizontal cornice tie together all the elements, therefore underlining the horizontal continuity of the structure. Fenestration consists mainly of wood louvered windows with glass. Some have been substituted by contemporary metal louvered windows, which are found all over the rest of the building. A most significant feature of Ponce High School is its two-story high, elongated auditorium, which also contains a generous stage area and a U-shaped wood mezzanine supported from the concrete ceiling. Its original lighting fixtures were removed and replaced by fluorescent ones. Classrooms are well lit and ventilated; there are many openings. Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original wood floor finish is still retained in the library, the auditorium, and many of the classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. Hallways and stairs are paved in concrete. Vinyl flooring is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use. Two small lean-to wood and zinc structures were added a few years ago. The auditorium was adapted to air conditioning features, with acoustic ceiling and related fixtures having been added. In spite of it all, and probably, because of the school's imposing scale, well balanced proportions and well-kept classical detailing, the integrity has not yet been lost. Significance Ponce High School is one of the five best school buildings built in Puerto Rico at the beginning of the 20th century and one of the most impressive. Between 1900 and 1925 over 3,000 schools were erected on the Island; only four included fully equipped auditoriums (not just assembly rooms) in their design: San Juan's Central High, Luis Mu√±oz Rivera School in Salinas, Arecibo's own Luis Mu√±oz Rivera School and Ponce High School. In that sense, these are the most representative examples of school building ideas being developed at the time in the United States by architects of renown, such as Haussander and Perkins of Chicago, Snyder of New York, Cooper of Boston and, especially, William B. Ittner of St. Louis.Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Jorge Rigau, AIA, Form Preparer, Colacion. Inc. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) March 16, 1987. In National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001310. August 4, 1987. Given the date of erection (earlier than for most other public schools built on the Island) Ponce High School emerges, as one of the earlier American government-sponsored construction efforts at such a large scale on the Island. Strikingly significant is the fact that with the choice of building vocabulary (strongly reminiscent of Mc Kim, Mead & White's Pennsylvania Station in New York) the use of the neoclassical style for educational structures was introduced in Puerto Rico. Ponce High School is today one of the most dignified and imposing structures in the city, a fact underlined by its architectural style, scale and overall architectural merits. Architect So far, the name of the architect for Ponce High School remains a mystery, although many facts point to Adrian C. Finlayson as its designer.\\"La Ponce High\\" por Carlos Aneiro P√©rez in Balc√≥n hist√≥rico de la Perla del Sur, 30 de junio al 6 de julio de 1993, conservado en el Archivo Hist√≥rico de Ponce, PR. Mr. Finlayson was, at the time, architect of the Insular Government's Interior Department, and was responsible for many other structures of similar use, size and style. As such, he is a key figure on Puerto Rico's architectural development. Most historians, however, coincide that Finlayson was in fact its architect.Maruja Candal Salazar and Neysa Rodriguez Deynes. Museo de la Historia de Ponce. Sala de Educacion. 30 December 2016. Setting Its setting ‚Äî on a block surrounded by other schools also of architectural merit ‚Äî adds to the school's important urban role. The site itself is a historic one, where the U.S. Army barracks were once located, before a fire ravaged the premises. The event is widely remembered in Ponce. Partial list of principals * Horace O.

The cocalero movement had mobilized since late May 1988 in opposition to coca eradication under Law 1008, then on the verge of becoming law. According to video evidence and a joint church-labor investigative commission, UMOPAR opened fired on unarmed protesters, at least two of whom were fatally shot, and many of whom fled to their deaths over a steep drop into the San Mateo River. The police violence caused the deaths of 9 to 12 civilian protesters, including three whose bodies were never found, and injured over a hundred. The killings were followed by further state violence in Villa Tunari, Sinahota, Ivirgarzama, and elsewhere in the region, including machine gun fire, beatings, and arrests. The massacre helped bring about the consolidation of Chapare coca growers' unions into the Coordinadora of the Six Federations of the Tropic of Cochabamba. Representatives of the National Congress, Catholic Church, Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, and the Central Obrera Boliviana labor federation formed a joint \\"multisectoral commission\\" to investigate the repression in the Chapare, which traveled to the region on 30 June 1988.  Background  UMOPAR, a police unit with military training, was created in 1983 for the purpose of overseeing coca eradication in Bolivia. They received tactical and technical support from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) who maintained an operational base in the Chapare region of the country as did the Bolivian coca eradication and substitution agency Direccion de Reconversion Agricola (DIRECO). UMOPAR and the US conducted the joint Operation Blast Furnace in 1986, in a unsuccessful effort to eradicate cocaine processing labs from the Chapare. US personnel and US-hired Bolivians actively directed antidrug operations in the region. In 1988, the DEA and UMOPAR began the antinarcotics Operation Snowcap, while US Border Patrol agents supported Bolivia police checkpoints on roads in the Chapare. US Army Special Forces troops conducted training courses for UMOPAR troops at the base camp of Chimor√©, east of Villa Tunari, beginning in 1987. From 1985 to 1988, just as government policy increasingly focused on the eradication of coca crops, coca growers unions grew in size and activity in Bolivia. Coca growers demanded that treatment of their crops be detached from the criminalization of the cocaine trade. They carried out marches, demonstrations, hunger strikes, and road blockades in support of their demands. Unionized coca growers‚Äô hostility towards DIRECO and the UMOPAR increased throughout 1988 in the leadup to the massacre. In early 1988, DIRECO staff used herbicides to destroy coca in violation of agreements reached between the government and farmers. Bolivian coca growers in the region alleged that in addition to providing logistical assistance to UMOPAR the DEA was also responsible for this chemical eradication of their crops.  Coca growers mobilization in 1988  From late May onward, Chapare coca growers mobilized in opposition to herbicidal eradication and the pending passage of a law that would criminalize coca leaf production in their region. On 30 May, farmers in the Chapare town of Eterazama warned journalists that the continued use of herbicides would lead them to confront DEA intruders in the region and coca producer leader Rene Santander likewise demanded that DEA agents leave the region or face organized resistance. On 11 June, farmers in Villa Tunari threatened to take over coca- eradication facilities by force if the Bolivian congress approved the Ley 1008 legislation that would classify coca-growers as cocaine traffickers. On 15 June, meetings between growers and the government ended without reaching any resolution on these issues and DIRECO officials soon went on collective vacation, aware of the farmers‚Äô intentions to take direct action.  27 June 1988  Following a night of meetings in Villa Tunari, peasant leaders made the decision to visit the DIRECO facility that was adjacent to the UMOPAR barracks in order to address directly the agency‚Äôs use of herbicides. Union leader Julio Rocha led what is variously reported as a group of 3,000, 4,000,‚ÄúCinco Muertos Habr√≠an Causado Enfrentamientos En El Chapare.‚Äù or 5,000 coca-growers to the facilities. Finding the DIRECO compound unoccupied, Rocha and three other peasant leaders went to the UMOPAR guard post and requested to speak with the commander in charge, Colonel Jos√© Luis Miranda, who authorized their entry while the rest of the farmers waited at the entrance and at the neighboring DIRECO facility. While talks took place between the peasant leaders and the Colonel, the peasants remained calm and peaceful but UMOPAR troops nonetheless became increasingly nervous due to the peasants‚Äô large numbers. At this time, the coca-grower Eusebio T√≥rrez Condori was shot and killed near the entrance to the DIRECO facility and dozens of growers began to enter the UMOPAR camp to report this event to their leaders who were at that time still meeting with the Colonel. UMOPAR troops retreated and eventually between 400 and 600 of the coca-growers gained entrance to the camp. Attempting to calm the increasingly tense situation, the UMOPAR Colonel promised to establish a committee to investigate the killing committed by DIRECO personnel and reached a verbal commitment of mutual non-aggression with the peasant leader Julio Rocha.‚ÄúTensa Calma Reina En Toda La Regi√≥n Del Chapare‚Äù; Azcui, ‚ÄúLa ‚Äòguerra de la coca√≠na‚Äô en Bolivia‚Äù; Centro de Documentaci√≥n e Informaci√≥n (CEDOIN), ‚ÄúRepresi√≥n En Villa Tunari: Cuidado Con La Guerra de La Coca,‚Äù 3 Despite a multisectoral research commission‚Äôs findings that the gathered peasants had up until this point shown neither violence or aggression, an UMOPAR soldier radioed for reinforcements from the nearby town of Chimor√©. Upon arrival to Villa Tunari at 10:30 am, the reinforcement UMOPAR forces under the command of Major Primo Pe√±a acted in what has been described as \\"disproportionate\\" and \\"brutal\\" violence. Arriving in several vans, with DEA agents reportedly leading them, the reinforcements opened fire on the peasants, killing Felicidad Mendoza de Peredo in the adjacent market grounds and also firing tear gas into the market, school, and a health clinic. The Villa Tunari UMOPAR troops likewise began shooting at the gathered peasants at this time. Eyewitnesses claimed that as many as twenty peasants attempting to escape the crossfire by fleeing from the back of the camp fell 30 meters into the San Mateo River and drowned. Other witnesses affirmed that they saw troops throw four unidentified peasants into the river. Some of the events in Villa Tunari were video recorded. Journalist Jo Ann Kawell summarized the \\"hour-long video tape made by a crew from a local television station\\": > Hundreds of marchers, dressed in shabby work clothes and carrying no visible > arms, not even sticks, approach the post. Nervous police, wearing camouflage > uniforms and armed with automatic rifles,block the marchers' advance. A > union leader asks permission for the group to enter and go to the > eradication program office located on the site. Shots ring out. One farmer > falls dead, another is wounded. Several farmers, including the wounded man, > point out the police agent who fired. A police official promises that his > men's arms will not be used again \\"against campesinos. Only to fight drug > traffickers.\\" But many more shots are heard as the police push the marchers > off the grounds and far down the road. These events resulted in the deaths of coca-growers Mario Sipe (drowned), Tiburcio Alanoca (drowned), Luis Mollo, Sabino Arce, Trifon Villarroel, and Emigdio Vera Lopez, whose bodies were all recovered. Calixto Arce, recorded as missing by the multisectoral commission, is among the dead as reported in 2018. Multiple sources, including the state-run newspaper Cambio, report three additional deaths by drowning, whose bodies were never found. Eleven protesters were arrested during day's events.  Allegations that the protesters were armed  Information Minister Herman Antelo publicly alleged that the peasant protesters were armed with carbines, revolvers, and dynamite cartridges, obligating the police to act in defense of the law and themselves. Antelo claimed that three of the eleven arrested protesters were armed. The multisectoral commission concluded that \\"not only does not a single piece of evidence prove this, but also the testimony of persons of religious [observers] is unanimous in signally that they did not see anyone either drunk or armed. This is corroborated by the images filmed on 27 June.\\"\\"Respecto al supuesto armamento de los campesinos o de que estuiveron ebrios, no s√≥lo no existe una sola prueba sino que el testimonio de personas y de los religiosos es un√°nime en se√±alar que no se vio a nadie ebrio por las im√°genes filmadas el 27 de junio.\\" Antelo also stated that the police \\"did not fire shots at the crowd, but rather at the air\\" and claimed that one police officer was killed. The multisectoral commission reported that, \\"The announced death of a soldier on June 27 was denied to this Commission by the very officials and soldiers of UMOPAR [in] Villa Tunari. That soldier had died days before the events.\\"  DEA involvement controversy  The direct role of the US Drug Enforcement Administration officers in the violence is disputed. A witness to the shooting of Felicidad Mendoza de Peredo in the market stated that she was killed by \\"a gringo\\" shooting at point-blank range. Evo Morales recalled that \\"I was a witness to how the gringos from the DEA fired upon us and the Villa Tunari massacre was made. Later, we recovered cadavers drowned in the river and others with bullet wounds. It was all for the defense of the coca leaf against Law 1008.\\"\\"He sido testigo de c√≥mo los gringos de la DEA nos dispararon y se produjo la masacre en Villa Tunari. Despu√©s recogimos cad√°veres ahogados en el r√≠o y otros con orificios de bala. Todo era por la defensa de la hoja de coca contra la Ley 1008\\" In a 1989 summary of the incident, the US State Department stated, \\"Five DEA agents were at the base, but they did not take part in the fighting and were not hurt.\\"US Department of State. Bureau of Diplomatic Security. 1989. Significant Incidents of Political Violence Against Americans 1988. Washington: Department of State. Jo Ann Kawell, describing video evidence of the massacre wrote, \\"The farmers later charged that agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminstration had encouraged the police action. Nothing in the video seems to prove this, though, judging by their appearance, several men among the police could be North Americans.\\" The multisectoral commission concluded that, > There is conclusive evidence that DEA agents and/or US military instructors > participated in the reinforcement detachement from UMOPAR-CHIMORE. What has > not been possible to objectively determine is whether they came to fire > weapons or chemical agents against the peasants, as multiple denunciations > affirm. According to Rensselaer W. Lee, \\"It was widely reported in the media that the reinforcements included DEA agents.\\" Peter Andreas and Coletta Youngers wrote that, \\"The presence of DEA personnel in the police station at the time of the incident evoked bitter criticism of DEA interference in Bolivian internal affairs. As a result of such incidents, the perception of much of the population in Bolivia, as in the rest of the Andes, is that the DEA now plays the role of an occupation army.\\"  Aftermath  After the massacre, UMOPAR troops continued their repression of protesters and the population of the Chapare. In Villa Tunari, American helicopters flew overhead as houses were raided. Residents Danitza Guzm√°n de Gordillo, Francisco Choque Sausiri and others were arrested and several union and civic leaders kidnapped in what the Multisectoral Commission later described as a climate of \\"fear, anxiety and intimidation\\". Leaders of the Federaci√≥n Especial de Agricultores del Tr√≥pico described to the newspaper Ultima Hora how \\"they came back to repress the townspeople of Villa Tunari, in the presence of civic leaders and local authorities,\\" as soon as journalists covering the massacre had left the town. Municipal council leader Jos√© Villarroel Vargas attributed the repression to \\"North American military troops who entered\\" Villa Tunari on the day of the massacre. This violence next spread to nearby towns in the Chapare, where other peasants were preparing their own protests.Ataque a poblaci√≥n de Ivirgarzama . Pero el 27 de junio , el ataque instruido por el Gobierno y la DEA tambi√©n alcanz√≥ a otras poblaciones del Tr√≥pico , sobre todo a Ivirgarzama y Chimor√© , donde se realizaban preparativos para el inicio de movilizaciones en contra de la Ley 1008 y denunciando el inicio de la 'guerra biol√≥gica.' Peasants on the Villa Tunari-Sinahota road and the Sinahota-Chimor√© road were beaten by UMOPAR troops and teargassed from overhead helicopters. For example, at the intersection of the road to Aurora Ala, UMOPAR troops beat up Aquilino Monta√±o and Carlos Rodrigues while teargassing others. At the intersection of the Lauca √ë road UMOPAR troops also beat and kicked peasants. An unknown number were arrested; the multisectorial commission concluded \\"the detentions ‚Ä¶ had no justified reason.\\" Later the same afternoon, a town hall was held in nearby Ivirgarzama to analyze the morning‚Äôs events in Villa Tunari. At 4:00 pm UMOPAR troops and helicopters (identified as DEA aircraft by locals) began to tear gas and machine gun those gathered. Rom√°n Colque O√±a, Margarita √Åvila Panozo, and three-year-old Grover Quiroz were transported to Cochabamba with gunshot wounds. In the coming days, security forces would continue beatings, the use of tear gas, and helicopter fly-overs in Ivirgarzama as well as Parajtito. On 30 June, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), the country's labor federation, carried out a 48-hour strike in protest of the killings in Villa Tunari; the government declared the strike to be illegal. Evo Morales, later president of Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, was present at the confrontation. At the time of the massacre, Morales was serving as the executive of the Central 2 de Agosto, a local union of coca growers. Soon afterwards, Morales was elected to head the Federation of Peasant Workers of the Tropic of Cochabamba as part of a slate known as the Broad Front of Anti-Imperialist Masses (Frente Amplio de Masas Anti-Imperialistas).\\"In 1988, shortly after the Massacre of Villa Tunari, Morales and a group of associates, who called themselves the ‚ÄúAnti-Imperial Front‚Äù (Frente Amplio de Masas Anti-Imperialistas‚ÄîFAMAI), were elected to the leadership.\\" On June 27, 1989, Morales spoke at the one-year anniversary commemoration of the massacre. The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members.  Passage of coca law  The Coca and Controlled Substances Regime Law () was passed on 19 July 1988. The law outlawed coca production outside of specified zones, making all coca growing in the Chapare subject to eradication without compensation. However, some US priorities were excluded from the law: defoliants, herbicides, and aerial spraying of crops were prohibited from being used in eradicating coca, and areas including the Chapare were placed into a transitional category where coca growers were entitled to economic support during the process of eradication. According to Peter Andreas and Coletta Youngers, the law \\"outlawed herbicide use in an apparent attempt to appease protesters.\\" See also * Coca in Bolivia * War on Drugs * UMOPAR References Category:1988 in Bolivia Category:1988 mass shootings Category:1988 murders in South America Category:1980s crimes in Bolivia Category:1980s mass shootings in South America Category:20th-century mass murder in South America Category:Coca in Bolivia Category:June 1988 crimes Category:June 1988 events in South America Category:Massacres in 1988 Category:Massacres in Bolivia Category:Police brutality Massacre ","title":"Villa Tunari massacre"},{"id":"26087871","text":"is a railway station on the Tsugaru Railway Line in the city of Goshogawara, Aomori, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Tsugaru Railway Company.

Cradle Coast  The region is characterised by some as 'Cradle to Coast' as a reference to the World Heritage listed icon Cradle Mountain. The region stretches from the coastline inland to rugged mountain areas. The term Cradle Coast is also the name of a regional local government authority within this region - The Cradle Coast Authority (CCA) which is a joint authority formed under the Tasmanian Local Government Act (1993) by the local government councils of Burnie City, Central Coast, Circular Head, Devonport City, Kentish, King Island, Latrobe, Waratah-Wynyard and West Coast (the participating Councils). The Cradle Coast region comprises the combined areas of the CCA's participating councils. The CCA is governed by a two-tiered structure comprising two representatives from each participating council (the Representatives) and a skills-based board of directors (the Board). The CCA was established by the nine Local Government Councils of North West Tasmania to represent and advocate the needs of the region. The CCA collaborates and facilitates a diverse range of projects and initiatives involving all tiers of government, industry and the community, by operating under three focus areas: Regional Economic Development, Natural Resource Management and Tourism.  COVID-19 pandemic  The region was a site of particularly severe disruption during the autumn 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Two hospitals in Burnie, North West Regional Hospital (NWRH) and North West Private Hospital, were closed when an outbreak of the virus occurred among the staff. The emergency department at the NWRH was staffed by Australian Defence Force personnel for two weeks while the usual staff were under a mandatory 14 day quarantine after exposure to the virus. there had been at least 12 deaths from COVID-19 in the region, out of a total of 13 statewide.

The Liard Formation contains marine index fossils that define its age, but it is less fossiliferous than the underlying Toad Formation. Lithology The Liard Formation is composed of dolomitic to calcareous sandstone and siltstone, with minor thin beds of dolomite and bioclastic limestone. The limestone becomes cherty south of the Peace River. Distribution The Liard Formation extends from the Liard River to the Pine River in the foothills of the Northern Rockies in northeastern British Columbia. It reaches a maximum thickness of about 420 metres (1370 ft) in the Williston Lake area. Relationship to other units The Liard Formation overlies the Toad Formation, and the contact is conformable in most areas. It is conformably overlain by the Charlie Lake Formation in the southern part of its extent. To the north in the Liard River area, it is unconformably overlain by the Garbutt Formation and Buckinghorse Formation.

The storm's center tracked from Baja California Sur on February 2nd, 2010 to the East coast on February 6, 2010, before heading east out into the Atlantic. Effects were felt to the north and west of this track in northern Mexico, California, and the Southwestern, Midwestern, Southeastern, and most notably Mid-Atlantic States. Severe weather, including extensive flooding and landslides in Mexico, and historic snowfall totals in every one of the Mid-Atlantic states, brought deaths to Mexico, New Mexico, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Most crippling was the widespread 20 to 35 in (50 to 90 cm) of snow accumulated across southern Pennsylvania, the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Maryland, Delaware, and southern New Jersey, bringing air and Interstate Highway travel to a halt. While rail service south and west of Washington, D.C. was suspended, rail travel between D.C. and Boston was available with limited service. Blizzard conditions were reported in a relatively small area of Maryland, but near-blizzard conditions occurred across much of the Mid-Atlantic region. This event was the second of four nor'easters during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's population to be numerically recognized by NOAA's NESIS intensity rating. The first and third of these systems, the December 2009 Nor'Easter and the February 9‚Äì10, 2010 North American blizzard, respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record to much of the Mid-Atlantic. Additionally, this event was the second of three major Mid- Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period; each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north: the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped more than a foot of snow across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the February 9‚Äì10, 2010 North American blizzard bulls-eyed the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with as much as 38.3 inches.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc5.html Meteorological history Snow-covered Mid-Atlantic region of the United States The main storm system originated in the Pacific Ocean, bringing heavy rain and mountain snow to California and Arizona on February 2. The storm center moved east through northern Mexico on February 3. The system produced over one foot of snowfall in the higher elevations and the eastern plains of New Mexico, shutting down major highways including Interstate 40 east of Albuquerque for several hours on February 3. The storm's center then advanced across Texas to the Louisiana Gulf Coast on February 4, while dropping rain and snow in Oklahoma and northern Texas, and severe thunderstorms further south. Meanwhile, a second, more-northern disturbance tracked from the central Rockies to the lower Missouri River Valley, bringing light snow showers to Montana, the Dakotas, parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. February 5‚Äì6, 2010 North American blizzard Mid Atlantic snowfall accumulation (from the National Weather Service). On February 5, the two systems phased together, resulting in a band of heavy snow across Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. That evening, the northern system's energy was absorbed into the main southern circulation, promoting fast intensification. Heavy snow subsequently developed over the Mid-Atlantic states as the storm's center tracked across North Carolina towards the Atlantic Coast. NEXRAD Animation from 5 February 2010. An antecedent and nearly-stationary upper-level trough over the Maritime Provinces of Canada served to block the storm system from following the traditional northeast track into New England. Instead, during the AM hours of February 6th, the storm center slowed its northeasterly movement as it continued to deepen east of Virginia Beach, before it eventually was forced eastward. The blocking pattern was reflected on the storm's snowfall map by a sharp northern gradient in northern New Jersey and by the axis of heaviest snow running WNW-ESE through Maryland and Delaware (opposed to the SW-NE pattern found from most Nor'Easters). Only moderate accumulations reached the southern suburbs of New York City, with no more than light snow falling in the city itself. Upstate New York and New England were spared from this system, receiving little more than isolated snow flurries in southern sections. Easterly winds and onshore flow contributed to light snow accumulations of less than one inch in Boston, Cape Cod, and parts of coastal Rhode Island. According to the blog of Weather Channel senior meteorologist Stu Ostro, the storm formed from \\"Miller Type B\\" cyclogenesis: a storm centered over the Ohio river runs into a blocking ridge and redevelops along the Carolina coast. (This differed from the North American blizzard of 2009, of \\"Miller Type A\\" cyclogenesis where a storm center develops over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and strengthens while tracking north to a latitude of greater temperature contrast.) This storm was carrying an enormous amount of moisture drawn from both the Gulf of Mexico (as seen on February 3 satellite imagery over Mexico), and from the Atlantic (as seen in radar imagery from early on February 5). Ostro characterized the storm as having \\"strong dynamics\\" and expected the snowfall to be of long duration, typically leading to large accumulations. Nicknames Media reports emphasized the magnitude of the storm, giving rise to many nicknames for it including Snowmageddon and Snowpocalypse. The Capital Weather Gang blog on The Washington Post website ran an online poll on February 4, 2010, asking for reader feedback prior to the blizzard, and several blogs, including the paper's own blog, followed that up by using either \\"Snowmageddon\\" and/or \\"Snowpocalypse\\" during the following days, before, during, and after the storm hit. The Washington Post also popularized other portmanteaus, including \\"snOMG\\" (from OMG) and \\"kaisersnoze\\" (from Keyser Soze), in response to the February snowstorms. During the evening preceding the first blizzard hitting Washington, D.C., most of the United States federal government closed, and press coverage continued to characterize the storm using either \\"Snowmageddon\\", \\"Snowpocalypse\\", or both. The phrase was later popularized by the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on February 8, 2010, who used the term while speaking at the Democratic National Committee's meeting.

The rain, which began early in the week and peaked on Thursday, February 4, had relented by Friday morning, providing officials with their first good look at the damage. More than half of the country was affected. The hardest area hit by the storm was the western state of Michoac√°n, a famous reserve for monarch butterflies, where at least 13 people were killed by landslides and flooding. An unknown number of people were missing Friday.. Other areas that were hard hit by flooding was the eastern Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa and municipalities in eastern State of Mexico such as Ciudad Nezahualc√≥yotl and Ecatepec de Morelos. The rain broke records for February in Michoac√°n, the State of Mexico and Mexico City, with twice the normal amount for the entire month falling in 24 hours. There was a silver lining: Officials said the copious rain had filled reservoirs outside Mexico City that are a key source of water for the metropolis. Water shortages had forced on-and-off rationing since last summer. Water authorities state that most of the country now has a \\"positive balance\\" in reservoirs with of water added to reservoirs.

A drenching rain fell early Friday in the Charlotte and Atlanta area and then transitioned to a few inches of snow later in the day, while several inches of snow accumulated farther north. Parts of central and eastern North Carolina were under flood watches in advance of significant rainfall of up to . Midwest Heavy snowfall occurred in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio February 4‚Äì6. Snowfall totals ranged from to over across the region. Drifts of up to were reported in central Indiana. The heavy snow, ice storms and low temperatures of January the 26th led to Interstate 90 being closed from Chamberlain, South Dakota to the Minnesota border. On the nightfall on Monday, Interstate 29 was closed from Sioux Falls to the North Dakota border. Power company officials estimated that about 7,600 customers in South Dakota and 100 in North Dakota did not have power on Monday. Some phone systems also experienced brief telecommunications outages. Kristi Truman, director of the North Dakota Office of Emergency Management was concerned about failing water and power supplies. In the Dakotas a number of Indian Reservations were left without power or running water. \\"There's been winters this bad before, but not with rain so bad it freezes the power lines and snaps the poles\\", said Joseph Brings Plenty, the 38-year-old chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe. Power outages began with a storm in December knocking down around 5,000 power poles, and was accelerated by an ice storm Jan. 22 knocking down another 3,000 power lines on the reservation. Among the tribes of South Dakota who suffered from the multiple storms were Cheyenne River Sioux, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Flandreau- Santee Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Sisseton- Wahpeton Oyate and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The Episcopal Church stepped in to help the reservations residents survive the winter. On February 1, utility crews worked overtime to get power back to the 14,000 residents of Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. The wind chill factor averaged about 25 ¬∞F below zero and there was about 1 foot of snow on average. Power outages in both the Dakotas power covered only 100 rural electric customers and minimal numbers in Bismarck, North Dakota by February, 5.http://www.kxnet.com/getArticle.asp?ArticleId=516417 Mid-Atlantic The United States Government implemented an unscheduled leave policy for federal employees on Friday February 5 and shut down four hours early in an effort to clear metropolitan Washington before substantial snow accumulations began. Numerous school districts in the metro DC area announced closures for Friday February 5 well in advance, although District of Columbia Public Schools and some Maryland schools held a half day of class. Many districts had used all their built-in snow days and some began scheduling classes on upcoming holidays (for example, Fairfax County on February 15, the Monday of President's Day weekend).. Late on Sunday February 7, the Office of Personnel Management announced that the United States Government would again be closed on Monday February 8, with only emergency/essential personnel required to report, and numerous school districts again canceled classes between February 9‚Äì11. As of shortly after midnight on February 6, more than 50,000 homes and businesses in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area were without electricity. In northern Virginia, the total was 33,000 and in northern Maryland and the District of Columbia the total was 19,000. Roadways were blanketed with snow, Metro bus service ended at 9 pm EST, and above ground Metro rail service had also ended. Flights were canceled at the Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at Philadelphia International Airport. Delta Air Lines had suspended flights in and out of Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Cars covered by snow near the end of the blizzard, Pentagon City, Arlington, Virginia In Maryland, the Maryland Transit Administration ran special snow trains on its heavy rail and light rail lines to keep tracks clear. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10 p.m. EST (this was in addition to an earlier state of emergency declared by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and snow emergencies declared in the District of Columbia and some Maryland counties).. Maryland was under a state of emergency as of mid-day on February 6, as state and county road crews said they were struggling to keep even one lane open on major roads and 151,000 customers were without power in Maryland, including 34,000 Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. customers in the region. Cars were left abandoned on highways, trees came down and Humvees were used to ferry patients to local hospitals.. The United States Postal Service decided to cancel mail delivery and collection in the affected areas for Saturday, February 6. Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. The weight of the snow caused several roof collapses throughout the Washington area. Most notably, the roof of a hangar housing private jets at Dulles International Airport caved in twice due to the snowfall..

In Pittsburgh, both the impact and severity of the storm caught many by surprise. Snow began falling in earnest late Friday morning. The sudden onset of the storm forced many local school districts, especially districts south of the city, to close early due to rapidly deteriorating road conditions; this is an extremely uncommon event for schools in southwestern Pennsylvania. Nearly all schools, including the Pittsburgh Public Schools, cancelled classes the following week. Most local universities were also forced to cancel classes for much of the following week due to the storm's effects. Additionally, over 130,000 people in the Pittsburgh area were without power as a result of the heavy, wet snow. For many residents, power was not restored until Monday, February 15. In New Jersey, the southern part of the state got hit with areas of 20+ inches of snow and some parts of the north got 0 to trace.

His name is pronounced eed. Born in Moline, Illinois, Ed graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. He was 22 years old when he worked on the baseball strip Big Ben in 1912. Returning to Rock Island, he signed on as a reporter with the Rock Island Argus, where he was soon promoted to sports editor and then became the newspaper's city editor, while also drawing another baseball strip, Luke McGlook, the Bush League Bearcat (a.k.a. Luke McGluke), distributed by the World Color Syndicate. He moved on to Chicago as a sports cartoonist on the Chicago American where he also drew the strip The Tener Alley Gang.Holtz, Allen. Stripper's Guide, September 2007. Harold Teen begins Carl Ed's signature is at bottom right on this Milton Bradley board game from the 1920s. He drew samples for a strip titled Seventeen, loosely based on Booth Tarkington's successful novel Seventeen. After publisher Patterson renamed it Harold Teen, it debuted in the New York Daily News during February 1919. Asked in the late 1930s why he had started the strip, Ed answered, \\"Twenty years ago, there was no comic strip on adolescence. I thought every well-balanced comic sheet should have one.\\"Harold Teen at Don Markstein's ToonopediaWaugh, Coulton. The Comics, 1947. Carl Ed's strip was widely read in the 1920s, and his readers became familiar with such slang as \\"shebas\\", \\"sheiks\\" and \\"pantywaist\\". Some of these were words and phrases created by Ed, such as, \\"Fan mah brow.\\" With the popularity of the strip, Ed profited from merchandising of games, figurines and other products. He added Josie as a topper strip beneath Harold Teen and also found time to work as an instructor at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. Changing times Interest in the strip began to fade by the 1940s. When Ed, who lived at 711 Michigan Avenue in Evanston, Illinois, died October 10, 1959, his once-popular comic strip died with him. (He retired in the last week of September 1959, and Harold Teen continued until his final strips ran out on November 18, 1959.) His widow, Ellen Ed, died in July 1975.

BOE, number 181, 2004-07-28Francisco Reyes, El Colegio-Universidad Osuna, Aparejadores (published by Colegio Oficial de Aparejadores y Arquitectos T√©cnicos de Sevilla), Number 55 (TOC), May 1999. Accessed online 2010-02-07. Spain granted the university building the status of a monument in 2004. Since 1995, the building has again been a site for university-level studies. The old university The University of Osuna was founded based on a bull of Pope Paul III, and it was a peer university to the likes of the universities of Alcal√° de Henares, Bologna, or Salamanca. That bull was granted due to the efforts of Don Juan T√©llez Gir√≥n, Fourth Count of Ure√±a and First Duke of Osuna, who also gave it an endowment sufficient to its needs.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, El leitmotiv y patrimonio fundacional de la Universidad de Osuna. Accessed online 2010-02-07. Authorization for the university came directly from the pope without any specific involvement of the Spanish monarchy.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, La antigua Universidad de Osuna (Sevilla). Accessed online 2010-02-07. The University of Osuna had a system of scholarships, a residential hall for its students, and even its own burial ground. There were fifteen major professorial chairs in the university and eight lesser chairs in the associated college; these were grouped into faculties of Medicine, Law, Canon Law, Theology, and Arts.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, La antigua Universidad de Osuna (Sevilla). Accessed online 2010-02-07. Pozo Ruiz gives Law and Canon Law as a single department, and adds Arts, which Reyes omits. Of these, Theology was the most attended. Medical instruction was entirely theoretical: there was no operating theater. Philip II later added a chair in Mathematics. The first rector was Francisco Maldonado; the last was Diego Ramirez. Dominicans, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Carmelites all taught at the university. While one could get an excellent education at the old University of Osuna, one could also drift through, attend classes in a desultory manner, and add an academic degree to his name, as long as the fees were paid (supplemented by \\"propinas\\", tips, if one's academic performance were truly poor). Osuna was not unique among Spanish universities of its time in this respect, but it was often singled out as an example. Cervantes, whose grandfather served as corregidor of Osuna, mentions the university three times in his writings, never favorably. Writing a century and a half later, Diego de Torres Villarroel, a professor at the University of Salamanca, described the granting of degrees by the University of Osuna, as well as at the universities of Sig√ºenza and Irache, as amounting to \\"civil simony\\". Partly for these reasons, the University of Osuna narrowly escaped closure by Charles III in 1771 and was one of eleven universities closed in the reform of 1807. Its prerogatives were granted to the University of Seville. The university did not quite close down at this time, though its operations do seem to have been suspended when the building was used as a French headquarters during the Peninsular War. After the war, the university continued precariously until its definitive closure in 1824.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, La extinci√≥n de la Universidad de Osuna. Accessed online 2010-02-07. Student body There were three types of students at the university: colegiales, sopistas, and mante√≠stas.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, Los estudiantes universitarios de Osuna. Accessed online 2010-02-07. As elsewhere in Spain in that era, the privileged colegiales were a social class apart, a student elite guaranteed housing and food, and virtually guaranteed a more or less brilliant future. At its establishment, Osuna set aside funding for twenty colegiales: six in theology, six in canon law, four in civil law, and four in medicine. This number proved excessively ambitious: neither the University of Seville nor the University of Granada ever hosted so many colegiales, and, in practice, neither did Osuna: the largest number ever at one time was eight, in 1596. Positions were also endowed for 36 sopistas or capigorrones (the names mean, respectively, \\"eaters of thin soup\\" and \\"layabouts\\"), 12 each in grammar, arts, theology. These positions‚Äîagain, as in other Spanish universities of the time‚Äîwere reserved for poor young men of ability; they received a modest scholarship and their bread and board. It is not known how many sopistas actually attended the university, though there is a building near the university that tradition says was the \\"soup house\\" where they took meals. The degree of their poverty can be ascertained in part from a specific provision to supply them with shoes. These positions were set aside not so much to aid social mobility as because these graduates often reflected so well on the university. Their cuchara al cintur√≥n (\\"spoon on the belt\\") remains a symbol of the tuna (a type of student troubadour) down to this day. Finally, there were the ordinary students, the mante√≠stas (\\"day students\\"). Some of these were natives of Osuna or nearby towns under the seigneury of the same duke, and lived with their families or in rented rooms. The majority had taken religious orders and lived in their convents. The records show the rectors of the university having to involve themselves in numerous cases where a mante√≠sta failed to pay his rent, and no small number of mante√≠stas impregnated a housemaid and took religious orders as an alternative to taking on other responsibilities. As elsewhere in Spain, students were often disorderly: street riots were not uncommon, especially among those who were living in poverty to the point of hunger. In many cases, the student class could not be distinguished readily from that of vagrants, beggars, and thieves. Such conduct by some of the students often made the studies of the more responsible students difficult. In 1782, the rector reminded the students to \\"abstain from throwing rocks, both inside and outside the university; from doing damage to the doors and buildings; from defacing the walls‚Ä¶\\" Notable graduates * Joseph Blanco White (Jos√© Mar√≠a Blanco White),Blanco White mentions his degree from Osuna in passing in his Practical and Internal Evidence Against Catholicism; a poor scan is available online at archive.org: \\"‚Ä¶when I was not of sufficient standing [at Seville] for the superior degree of Licentiate of Divinity, which the Fellowship required, I took that degree at Osuna, where the statutes demand no interval between these academical honours.\\" poet, theologian. * Rodrigo Caro, poet, historian, archeologist, and lawyer.Rodrigo Caro, Biograf√≠as y Vidas.

The Escuela Universitaria opened for the academic year 1996‚Äì97. As of 1999, the university was granting diplomas in Labor Relations, Business, and Health Sciences. The building Significance The building of the former University of Osuna is significant both architecturally and for its long history as a seat of the university from its construction in 1548 to its closure in 1824. Its construction was ordered by Don Juan T√©llez Gir√≥n, founder of the university. The First Duke of Osuna was responsible for numerous buildings in his domain, nearly all of a religious character. The university building is, therefore, particularly notable as an essentially civil building devoted to education. The buildings erected under the patronage of the First Duke of Osuna are important primarily because of the adoption and diffusion of new stylistic currents and ideas from the Italian architecture of the time. The Renaissance aspects of the buildings are patent, as is the relation to the ideology of humanism in a building expressly created as a center for modern education. The surviving university building testifies to the Renaissance aesthetics, providing one of the most singular and defining architectural examples of Osuna's past greatness. Exterior The University building. In the background is La Colegiata: the Iglesia Colegial de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n (\\"College Church of Our Lady of the Assumption\\").The former University of Osuna is a rectangular two-story building organized around a square courtyard. Its architectural design is characterized by simplicity and severity of its straight lines. Its unique profile, having a tower at each of its four corners, each tower topped by a spire with a glazed ceramic coating, makes it one of the most emblematic buildings of the city. The four exterior walls are of stone. Several rectangular linteled openings are placed symmetrically. The towers at the two corners in front are cylindrical. The cylinders each extend a full story above the building, and then are covered by polygonal spires. The other two towers, in the rear, are square, in the style of buttresses; they extend to the same height as those in front, and their spires are pyramidal. The glazed ceramic coatings of the spires is in blue and white. The principal fa√ßade faces southeast, and is ornamented ashlar stonework. On the right half of the upper story are two linteled window bays, flanked by half-columns, with a pediment above. The principal entrance, which gives access to the interior, is to the left of center. For roughly two thirds of its height, the door is flanked by columns, over which there is a semicircular arch. That entire assemblage is finished at the outer edge with molding, flanked on both sides by attached columns on a high base, over which is an entablature with pinnacles on either end. On the second story over the entrance is a niche with a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus. This, in turn, is flanked with columns and pinnacles, a miniature of the entrance below; a tondo above shows the anagram of the Virgin. Over this all, another semicircular arch is worked into the fa√ßade. There in another window bay in the upper story to the left of the entrance, similar to the two bays on the right. There are four smaller windows on the upper part of the ground floor. Interior In the interior, most of the original rooms have been adapted and transformed into modern classrooms devoid of any artistic and architectural interest. However, the southeast side of the building, where the main entrance is located, retains its original structure, as do the gateway, the chapel, the Sala de la Girona (\\"Hall of Girona\\"), the central courtyard, the staircase leading upstairs and the old library. Vestibule One enters through the principal doorway to a rectangular vestibule or hall with a carved ceiling with two orders of beams on corbels, decorated with inlay work. This space opens on the right to the chapel, straight ahead to the central courtyard, and on the left to the Sala de la Girona. Chapel The chapel is rectangular, again with a carved ceiling with two orders of beams in the Plateresque style. Immediately above the entry is the choir loft, whose carved ceiling has a single order of beams. The center of this ceiling is decorated with Plateresque motifs alternating with tracery and pineapples. Over this ceiling is the rostrum of the upper choir, composed of a sill of wooden balusters. The presbytery is raised above the rest of the chapel and at its head sits a neoclassical altarpiece with paintings that date back to a former Renaissance altarpiece. It is separated from the nave by a bay, which is segmented by a 16th-century wrought-iron grating composed of two horizontal bands that divide the two areas. These bands have Renaissance-era decoration with a motif of flaming golden scrolls. Between the two bands are bent vertical bars that‚Äîin the lower central area‚Äîopen to provide access to the chapel. At the top of the grating is a crest composed of semicircles made of bent bars, pointed and crowned with heraldic motifs, configured as an entablature. The pulpit, made of wood, is on the left wall of the chapel. It consists of an access staircase with a sill of balustrades, a rectangular floor affixed to the wall like a balcony, and a semicircular bay embedded in the wall, under a triangular pediment topped with a cross. Sala de la Girona The Sala de la Girona is roughly rectangular, with a carved ceiling with two orders of beams over corbels. The upper part of its cladding is covered with murals painted in the second half of the 16th century. In the front end wall is a mural of the Virgin Mary enthroned with the baby Jesus on her lap; on both sides are groups of angels who giving him presents, as well as symbols related to the iconology of the Virgin. The composition is framed between drapes held back by angels, revealing an architectural background. On the right wall the four church fathers are represented, each seated on a chair and surrounded by books scattered on the ground. From left to right they are Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory, Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine, dressed according to the traditional iconography of these saints, each holding a staffs and a model of the church in one hand while the other shows the pen as a symbol of scripture. The composition is completed with architectural backgrounds and at the bottom with the names of each character written in classical characters on phylacteries. The mural on the wall facing the one previously described represents the Four Evangelists seated on a marble bench. From left to right are Saint Mark, Saint Luke, Saint John and Saint Matthew, each of them with his symbol. The last of the murals is on the front door. It presents a courtly scene in an imaginary rural landscape. A palatial building is surrounded by large trees and a river. Most the prominent focus is a hunting scene of galloping horsemen, but there are also shepherds and dogs caring for their herd. Analysis of the forms and the garments of the characters indicate has shown that the work dates from the early 18th century. Courtyard or patio The central courtyard () is rectangular, two stories high, with a double arcade on all four sides. The lower floor features marble columns of the Tuscan order, supporting paired, symmetrical semicircular bays. Above the columns are located small pillars that, at their connection to the entablature, form an alfiz, a type of arch characteristic of Morisco architecture. The upper galleries are composed of columns on high plinths, supporting semicircular bays, paired and covered with iron railings. In the center of the courtyard stands a well with a stone curb. The staircase rises from the southeast side of the courtyard. Three flights of stairs occupy a rectangular space. The stairs are covered by a barrel vault whose cladding is decorated with octagonal coffers. Library The former library‚Äîas of 2004 an assembly hall‚Äîsits over the chapel and the principal entrance. It is reached through the gallery of the courtyard, at the top of the staircase. It is rectangular, covered with very elongated trough-shaped armature. Paintings In addition to the murals mentioned above and the paintings of the four church fathers and the Four Evangelists, the building also has paintings of the Immaculate Conception, Annunciation, Nativity, and Epiphany and several portraits, including two each of Don Juan T√©llez Gir√≥n and Do√±a Mar√≠a de la Cueva. Use of the building after 1824 The fate of the building between 1824 and 1847 is unknown. The Law of Public Instruction of 17 September 1845 established Institutos de Segunda Ense√±anza (roughly high schools or secondary schools). The old university reopened in 1847 as such an institute, and operated in that capacity until 1993, when it moved to a former old age home restored and adapted by the Council of Education of the Andalusian Autonomous Government. Since 1995, the building has again been the site of university-level instruction, in the form of the Escuela Universitaria. This required a comprehensive restoration. On the one hand, the building was renovated to resemble as closely as possible its historical appearance; on the other hand, electricity, sanitary facilities, and climatization were brought up to modern standards. The wooden portions of the building, especially the elaborate ceilings, were painstakingly restored, as was the tilework on the towers. One new emergency staircase was added at the corner of the courtyard opposite the historic staircase; an emergency exit was added at the back. An elevator was also added, adjacent to the new staircase. During restoration, some interesting discoveries were made: the arrangement of openings to the courtyard had apparently been changed at least once in the course of the building's history. The decision was made to retain the longstanding configuration, rather than to restore an even earlier one.

Youth Soccer Career Born in Mirano, Veneto, Favaro started his youth career at A.C. Milan of Lombardy, where he played for five years from the 1998/99 to the 2002/2003 season. In his five years at A.C. Milan, Favaro scored 59 goals. Unfortunately, in March 2003 he had a ligament rupture that didn't allow him to play until January 2004. In 2003, A.C. Milan swapped youth players with Internazionale and Parma. That season, Favaro (‚Ç¨1M), Marco Donadel (‚Ç¨2M), and Mirko Stefani (‚Ç¨1M) of Milan were swapped for Roberto Massaro (‚Ç¨2M), Filippo Porcari (‚Ç¨1M) and Luca Ferretti (‚Ç¨1M). All deals were co-ownership deals and Favaro signed a 5-year contract. Favaro played a season at Primavera Team, where he was again trained by his former coach Davide Ballardini as well as scoring 6 goals in 12 matches. In June 2004, Parma bought the remaining rights to Favaro and Stefani, while Donadel was bought back by Milan and received in return the remaining rights for Porcari and Ferretti. Favaro played for the Italy National Team at 2001 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship qualifiers. Professional Soccer Career Since the 2004 season, Favaro was loaned to clubs in Serie C1 and Serie C2. In his first season, he played at S.S. Sambenedettese where he was trained for the third time by Ballardini, and the club reached third place in rank. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Favaro left for Giulianova and in mid-season swapped club with Fabio Mazzeo of Valenzana. In 2008‚Äì09 season, Favaro played for Chieti of Serie D, the 5th level and top of regional league and non- professional football. In 2009‚Äì10 season, Favaro joined newly re-found Treviso of Eccellenza Veneto whose predecessor entered bankruptcy and finished bottom of Serie B. Favaro scored 18 goals during that season, even though he played midfielder. The following season Favaro played at Feltre, where he scored 11 goals. Favaro then played at Dolo, where he scored 18 goals. Education Favaro graduated with a Bachelor of Art in Business Administration at University of Padua on October, 2013. On December, 2015, he again graduated with a Master of Science in Sports Administration from St. Thomas University in Miami, FL. In May, 2018, Favaro also obtained an MBA in Sport Management at St. Thomas University in Miami, FL.

It is a variation on the percussion revolver, designed with chambers in a drum mounted so it would rotate horizontally (around a vertically mounted pivot), rather than around a horizontal axis, in an attempt to circumvent the patent by of Samuel Colt. Chambers opened in all directions, and the weapon was prone to row ignition, all chambers firing in sequence, resulting in fatal accidents because one chamber always faces the shooter. Several designs were attempted, including an 1837 Cochran and an 1851 Porter. A number of turret rifles were also attempted. None of these weapons were successful, due to the row-firing hazard. As a result, they are very rare and much sought-after. Sources *Jeff Kinard, Pistols, 2004, (page 64) (Google Books) External links * - This link is now defunct and is replaced by an archive link.

Playing career Clayson had stints with clubs with Clube do Remo, Esporte Clube Rio Verde, and Abaete Futebol Clube. In 2006, he went abroad to Canada to sign with the Toronto Lynx of the USL First Division. His signing was announced in a press conference where the Lynx introduced two more signings from Brazil. Clayson failed to make an appearance during his short stint with Toronto, as he did not fit into Duncan Wilde's vision for the club and was subsequently deemed as surplus. In order to make room for new additional signings, Clayson's contract was bought out by the Brampton Stallions of the Canadian Soccer League. Clayson made his debut for the Stallions in a match against London City, where he recorded his first goal of the season in a 6-0 thrashing over City at home. Clayson would further contribute to the Stallions by scoring another goal in 6-0 victory over the Caribbean Selects. He had a relatively successful tenure with Brampton, where he led that Stallions to five game undefeated streak and finished off the season with three goals and four assists. He helped the Brampton side clinch a playoff spot by finishing second in the National Division. After his stint in Canada came to a conclusion, Clayson returned to Brazil to have stints with An√°polis Futebol Clube, Gama, and returned to the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie D to sign with CSA.

Rice and Company, PhiladelphiaElijah Middlebrook Haines. The American Indian (Uh-nish-in-na-ba): The Whole Subject Complete in One Volume: Illustrated with Numerous Appropriate Engravings, Chicago: The Mas-Sin-Na'-Gan Company, 1888. p. 592. Google Books He was descended from a line of chiefs and, according to the law of descents, which selects the next of kin who is worthy of succession, succeeded his elder brother, Tarecawawaho (Long Hair or Big Hair). They were sons of Sharitahrish, the first, a chief, who is mentioned in Pike's Expedition under the name of Characterish. Relations with American government When Tarecawawaho (Long Hair or Big Hair) was invited to visit the United States President James Monroe, he refused to do so, upon the ground that it would be too great a condescension. The Pawnees, he asserted, were the greatest people in the world, and himself the most important chief. He was willing to live at peace with the American people, and to conciliate the government by reciprocating their acts of courtesy. But he argued that the President could not bring as many young men into the field as himself; that he did not own as many horses, nor maintain as many wives; that he was not so distinguished a brave, and could not exhibit as many scalps taken in battle; and that therefore he would not consent to call him his great Father. He did not object, however, to return the civilities of the President, by sending a delegation composed of some of his principal men; and among those selected to accompany Indian Agent Benjamin O‚ÄôFallon to Washington on this occasion, was his brother Sharitahrish. Sharitahrish returned with enlarged views of the numbers and power of the white men, and with a more accurate assessment of the relative power of his own nation. As he traveled over the broad expanse of the American territory, Sharitahrish became convinced of the vast disparity between his own nation and the white man, and was satisfied that his people would suffer great loss by a state of warfare with that power. Death and succession Sharitahrish, the second, was a chief of noble form and fine bearing; he was six feet tall, and well proportioned; and when mounted on the fiery steed of the prairie, was a graceful and very imposing personage. His people looked upon him as a great brave, and the young men especially regarded him as a person who was designed to great distinction. After his return from Washington his popularity increased so greatly as to excite the jealousy of his elder brother, Tarecawawaho, the head chief, who, however, did not long survive that event. He died a few weeks after the return of Sharitahrish, who succeeded him, but who also died during the succeeding autumn, at the age of little more than thirty years. He was succeeded by his younger brother Iskatappe (Rich Man or Wicked Chief), a name given him by the Omahas.

The importers challenged the validity of the law authorizing the duty increase, alleging that a quorum was not present when the law was passed. On appeal, the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York sustained the importers' claim and reversed the Board's decision. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed the Circuit Court's judgment and upheld the Board's decision. The decision established unambiguously that when a quorum is present, approval by a majority of that quorum is sufficient for the House or Senate to pass a bill. Background For its first 100 years of existence, the United States House of Representatives did not pass legislation unless a full quorum of the House approved the bill. Those present, but not voting, could block votes and prevent a quorum‚Äîthe technique of the disappearing quorum. The practice was terminated in February 1890, with the adoption of a new set of House rules. In particular, Rule XV (passed on February 14, 1890House Journal, 230, February 14, 1890, cited in ) established that a quorum is satisfied if a majority of members are present, even if they withhold their votes on a particular bill. On March 1, 1888, the Ways and Means Committee of the House had started review of the McKinley Tariff bill, which would eventually pass the House on May 21, 1890. One part of the bill, drafted by Nelson Dingley, Jr. and known as the Worsted act, would \\"authorize and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to classify as woolen cloths all imports of worsted cloth,\\", c.200 in order to levy a higher rate of customs duty. The Worsted act came up for vote on May 9, 1890, garnering 138 yeas and 3 nays. House Speaker Thomas B. Reed requested a roll call, and 74 representatives were recorded by the clerk in the House Journal as being present and refusing to vote. The speaker concluded that those voting, together with the 74 members withholding their votes (in total more than 166 representatives), constituted a quorum present to do business. The House at the time comprised 330 seats. While the 51st Congress would eventually reach 332 seats, the Worsted act was voted on prior to Idaho and Wyoming being admitted to the Union. Since 138 yeas were more than one-half of the members present and voting (141 total voting, 215 total present), the speaker declared that the Worsted act had been passed. On July 21, 1890, Ballin, Joseph & Co imported into New York certain manufactures of worsted.In re Ballin et al., , (rev'g the Decision of the Board of United States General Appraisers), rev'd, . In line with the Worsted act, the collector assessed the duty rate prescribed at the time for manufactures of wool. The importers contended that the duty collected was in excess of what the law permitted, according to schedule K of , c.121. In their request for refund from the Board of General Appraisers, the importers argued that the Worsted act had been enacted in violation of Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of the United States. In particular, Ballin argued that a quorum of the House had not been present when the vote was taken and therefore the bill had not been legally passed. On October 13, 1890, the Board ruled against Ballin. Judge Henderson M. Somerville drafted the Board's decision, finding that the act of May 9, 1890, had been constitutionally enacted and that the duty had been correctly assessed by the New York collector. The importers appealed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, which reversed the Board's decision. The circuit court reasoned that the act Congress had passed \\"expressly confined the exercise of its powers to the Secretary of the Treasury, in exclusion of any other officer\\" and that the collector had overstepped his bounds. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on December 2, 1891, with Attorney General William Miller and Solicitor General William Howard Taft arguing the case for the government. Edwin B. Smith represented Ballin, Joseph & Co. Two questions were presented to the Court: \\"Was the act of May 9, 1890, legally passed?\\", and \\"What was the act's meaning?\\" On February 29, 1892, the Court issued its unanimous decision, addressing both questions in turn. The Court started by assuming that information recorded in the House Journal is always accurate. This effectively dismissed any claims based on possible mistakes in the journal. The Court noted that Speaker Reed's actions on May 9, 1890, as recorded in the journal, were in direct compliance with Rule XV; Rule XV had been legally enacted under the Rules of Proceedings Clause of the Constitution.. \\"The Constitution empowers each house to determine its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained. [...] The power to make rules is not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be exercised by the house, and within the limitations suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal.\\" Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, of the Constitution provides that \\"a majority of each [house] shall constitute a quorum to do business.\\" Rule XV provided the House with a clear method to establish the presence of a quorum. After determining that a quorum of the House had been present on May 9, 1890, the Court addressed the legality of enacting the Worsted act. The universal default rule of parliamentary bodies is that a majority of the quorum may take action. \\"The general rule of all parliamentary bodies is that, when a quorum is present, the act of a majority of the quorum is the act of the body [...], except so far as [...] the terms of the organic act under which the body is assembled have prescribed specific limitations. [...] No such limitation is found in the Federal Constitution, and therefore the general law of such bodies obtains.\\" and therefore the power of the house \\"[arises] when a majority are present.\\" In concluding their analysis of the first question, the Court stated that \\"a majority shall be a quorum to do business; but a majority of that quorum is sufficient to decide the most important question.\\", quoting Having established that the Worsted act was legally passed, the Court addressed the second question. The act unambiguously stated that duties on worsted cloths became identical to those placed on woolen cloths by the Tariff Act of 1883. Although no direct action was necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury to put this act into force, the Treasury Department issued a letter on May 13, 1890, instructing all customs officers to publish the act \\"for the information and guidance of the public.\\" The judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. Reaction The decision of the Supreme Court came as no surprise in Washington. Even Democrats who had objected to Reed's tactics in the Republican-controlled House as tyrannical, readily admitted that Representatives should participate in the business of the House whenever present. After being congratulated by his colleagues, Reed remarked on how pleased he was by the Court's decision: \\"That the whole need not participate is settled, their presence being the only essential.\\" The Spokane Review did not see the news as good, however, proclaiming that czarism had taken over the government: \\"The supreme court has handed down an infamous decision sustaining the ruling of Speaker Reed that a quorum is a quorum whether some of the members are dumb, deaf, blind or devoid of common sense. It is evident that we [...] will never enjoy perfect happiness until [this country] fills every branch of the public service with filibusterers and equips them with supreme power to block the transaction of business.\\" Subsequent developments In their 1995 Open Letter to Congressman Gingrich Bruce Ackerman and 16 other well-known law professors asserted that rules of procedure in Congress that require more than a simple majority of those voting to pass legislation are unconstitutional, in part basing their conclusion on the decision of Ballin. In particular, Ackerman et al. were writing about a rule adopted by the 104th Congress requiring a three-fifths majority to pass an increase in income tax rates. Professors John O. McGinnis and Michael B. Rappaport responded in the article The Constitutionality of Legislative Supermajority Requirements: A Defense by interpreting Ballin as stating that the universal default rule that a majority of the quorum may take action applies only when neither the Constitution nor the legislature imposes a specific rule. On that topic, the U.S. Mason's Manual notes, \\"A deliberative body cannot by its own act or rule require a two-thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote. To require a two-thirds vote, for example, to take any action would be to give to any number more than one-third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority.\\" The Rules of Proceedings Clause in the Constitution‚Äîthe organic act under which Congress is assembled‚Äîauthorizes the houses of Congress to pass a supermajority rule if they so choose. Hence, rules requiring supermajorities are constitutional, but the rules themselves could be changed by a simple majority. The debate between minority rights and majority rule continues , in particular as it relates to filibustering in the United States Senate. If the Senate voted on whether to change the cloture rule, only a simple majority would be needed to change it, though the attempt itself might be filibustered in an effort to prevent the majority from reaching a vote. However, the Senate reinterpreted the rule to require only a simple majority for cloture for nominations (or, more precisely, for confirmation of Presidential nominations) using the nuclear option in 2013 and 2017 and doing so for legislation has been suggested by both President Trump and some Senators.

(1899 ‚Äì 8 April 1930) was a British petty swindler and murderer. He was executed for the murder of his mother in an attempt to obtain money from an insurance policy on her life. His case is unusual in that it is a rare example of a known matricide in the United Kingdom. His murder was detected by then recent advances in forensic pathology. Early life Fox was described as \\"the son of decent working Norfolk parents\\". His mother, the former Rosaline Rallison (b.1866) had married railway porter William George Fox in 1887, and had three sons by him (William Edward James in 1888, Reginald Mitchell in 1891 and Cecil Rallison in 1894).FreeBMD (www.freebmd.org.uk) births for Depwade registration district, June quarter of 1888; births for Mutford [sic] registration district, September quarter of 1891; births for Mitford registration district, March quarter of 1894. However, eldest son William later told the press that his father had left home when he was six years old and that Sydney was therefore his illegitimate half-brother.Interview with William Edward Fox, Hampshire Telegraph, 15 November 1929, p.15 Fox was in trouble in his teens as a petty thief while in service at good houses, for which he was birched. Learning from his association with people of quality, he later developed a role as a plausible, genteel con-man until World War I, when he obtained a job in a London bank and proceeded to forge cheques on the accounts of his customers. On discovery of his dishonesty in 1916, Britain was then in the middle of the Great War and needed soldiers. Fox was offered immunity from prosecution on condition that he enlisted in the Army, however he enlisted in the Royal Air Force, getting an officer's commission by claiming to be an Old Etonian. He drew on his banking experience to forge cheques on his brother officers‚Äô accounts. He was caught and sentenced to three months in prison, ending his military career. The murder Fox and his mother Rosaline lived on 18 shillings per week (¬£ equivalent in 2010) between them, supplementing this by cashing worthless cheques and moving from town to town. In 1927, Fox was imprisoned for fraud and his mother committed to the workhouse. On his release, he commenced a bogus affair with a Mrs Morse for mercenary reasons; she knew nothing of his homosexuality. He used the access given to steal her jewellery, and he also insured her life for ¬£6000 (¬£ in 2010). Mrs Morse awoke one evening to find the gas-tap in her bedroom turned on. The resultant outcry led to a divorce action being filed by Mr. Morse, naming Fox as co-respondent. Fox was arrested on several charges, imprisoned for the jewellery theft and released in March 1929; he and his mother found it convenient to renew their travelling life. In April 1929 Fox persuaded his mother to make a will in his favour, despite her poverty, and on 1 May insured her life against accidental death, the policy to expire on 23 October. Some months later, they arrived at a hotel in Margate without any luggage and booked rooms. A week later, on 23 October, Fox and his mother ate dinner, Fox buying a half-bottle of port as a \\"nightcap\\" for her. At 11.40 pm that same evening, Fox raised the alarm that there was a fire in his mother's room, and her partly clad body was pulled out of it by another guest. Although a doctor certified suffocation and shock as the cause of death, and Rosaline Fox was buried in Norfolk a week later, the insurance investigators had examined the room and were suspicious. They believed that a patch of unburnt carpet between Mrs Fox's body and the gas stove supposedly the source of the flames made Fox's story inconsistent. As a result, Mrs Fox's body was exhumed for forensic examination. Sir Bernard Spilsbury performed the post-mortem and deduced that Mrs Fox had been strangled to death, due to a bruise on her larynx, and the absence of soot in her lungs showed that she had been dead before the fire had started. As a result, Fox was arrested and charged with the murder. Trial Fox was tried at Lewes Assizes before Mr Justice Rowlett, with Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett and Sir William Jowitt (then the Attorney-General) prosecuting, and J. D. Cassels defending. The defence were unable to challenge the evidence given by Spilsbury since the bruise on Mrs Fox's larynx had disappeared due to decomposition by the time their experts had examined it. Jowitt subjected Fox to a ferocious cross-examination, and Fox's excuse that he had closed his mother's door \\"so that smoke should not spread into the hotel\\" appeared to be cowardly. The jury therefore convicted Fox and he was hanged at Maidstone Jail on 8 April 1930, the Home Secretary having declined to intervene. Cassels later remarked that Fox might have saved himself by answering \\"I don't know\\" to Jowitt's question \\"why did you shut the door?\\" Dramatisations Around 1948, the radio series \\"Secrets of Scotland Yard\\" dramatised the story under the title \\"Smoke Clings to the Hair\\". The case was dramatised as \\"Murder at The Metropole\\" in 1976 as part of the \\"Killers\\" television series; Fox was played by Christopher Timothy. A later (1981) version, produced by Granada Television under the title \\"Lady Killers: A Boy's Best Friend\\", starred Tim Brierley. References  General references  F.

Bergquist (b. 1944). Major General Kenneth P. Bergquist Kenneth P. Bergquist (November 21, 1912 - August 4, 1993) was an officer of the United States Air Force, and its predecessor, the United States Army Air Forces, who ultimately attained the rank of major general. Biography Bergquist was born in Crookston, Minnesota in 1912. His family moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota in 1928, and he graduated from Central High School. He attended the University of North Dakota for a year, before enrolling in the United States Military Academy in 1931. Upon his graduation in 1935, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. Bergquist began flight training at Randolph Air Force Base in 1935, and completed flight training at Kelly Air Force Base, receiving his pilot's wings in October 1936. Bergquist's first posting was to Langley Air Force Base. In December 1937, he became assistant operations officer of the 8th Pursuit Group at Langley. He next became assistant operations officer of the 2nd Wing at General Headquarters Air Force, also at Langley. After a promotion to first lieutenant, Bergquist was posted to the 18th Pursuit Group at Wheeler Army Airfield in mid-1939. He was promoted to become the 18th Pursuit Group's operations and intelligence officer in June 1940. A year later, he became a colonel and operations officer of the 14th Pursuit Wing (soon to be renamed the Hawaiian Interceptor Command). The Hawaiian Interceptor Command suffered heavy casualties during the December 7, 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. Shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, the Hawaiian Fighter Command was redesignated the VII Fighter Command, and Bergquist remained its operations officer. In June 1942, Bergquist traveled to New Caledonia to oversee air defense for the United States Armed Forces on that island. Following the creation of the United States Army Air Forces in June 1942, Bergquist was assigned to the General Headquarters Air Force in Washington, D. C. in July 1942. There, he served in the operations section. In 1944, he was posted to the 73d Air Division in the Pacific Theater, seeing duty during the Battle of Saipan. He then served as operations officer of the VII Fighter Command during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Bergquist returned to Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington in September 1945, becoming deputy to the assistant chief of staff for operations. In July 1947, in the midst of the Greek Civil War, Bergquist was posted to Athens as a military air attach√©. He returned to the United States in August 1949. Bergquist then spent a year at the National War College, and then in 1950, joined the headquarters of the Continental Air Command at Mitchel Air Force Base. During his time in Greece, the United States Army Air Forces had been superseded by the United States Air Force (USAF), and Bergquist was now a member of the USAF. When the Air Defense Command was reestablished in January 1951, Bergquist became director of plans and requirements at its headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In this capacity, he was responsible for planning the U.S.'s air defense system. From September 1951 until June 1955, he was deputy chief of staff for operations of the Air Defense Command. He then returned to Air Force headquarters in Washington, D. C., serving as director of operations for two years, and then as assistant deputy chief of staff for operations. In June 1958, Bergquist was assigned to Hanscom Air Force Base as deputy commander (Air Research and Development Command). There, he was responsible for defense systems integration. In 1960, he became Commander of the Command and Control Development Division. When the Air Force Systems Command and the Air Force Logistics Command were established in April 1961, the organizations at Hanscom were consolidated and renamed the Electronic Systems Center, with Bergquist as the ESC's first commander. Bergquist became head of the Air Force Communications Service in February 1962. He retired on July 1, 1965. Bergquist died on August 4, 1993.

Egan was a member of a noted County Galway family, Mac Aodhag√°in. He is thought to have been born on Tuam's Old Road or at Cloonsheen. His father was a stonemason and he had siblings Patrick, Thomas, Bridget and Elizabeth. He began his apprenticeship in 1826, the same year as the foundation stone of Tuam's new Catholic Cathedral. By the late 1830s, Egan had progressed far enough to be entrusted with a supervisory role in the erection of the Bell Tower of the cathedral. In 1838, the local Roman Catholic Free School was constructed, and it is believed that Egan was the contractor. By 1839 he was classed a Master Builder and was optaining commissions from Tuam diocese. He married Margaret Lyons of Tuam on 20 October 1839. Their children were Mary Jane (born 1841, died young), William (1843), Thomas Andrew (1847), John Joseph (1852), Emilea Patricia (1854), Isabel Cecily (1857) and Mary, who also died young. From 1839 until his death, Egan was in continuous work. His most notable work was Tuam Town Hall, the foundation stone been laid in 1857. Others include the Glenamaddy workhouse, the bridge at Dunmore, the Presentation Convent, the Presbytery, as well as houses for middle-class and gentry families - Castlegrove, Toghermore, Oakmount and Brownesgrove. In addition, he was responsible for constructing various properties in the suburbs, Dublin Road, Waterslade Place, Foster Terrace, Eastland Row, the Square.

Efforts to regulate the sale of pharmaceuticals began around 1860, and laws were introduced on a state-to-state basis that created penalties for mislabeling drugs, adulterating them with undisclosed narcotics, and improper sale of those considered \\"poisons\\". Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription. Prominent pharmaceutical societies at the time supported the listing of cannabis as a poison. In 1880, the U.S. and Qing Dynasty China completed an agreement prohibiting the shipment of opium between the two countries; Qing China itself was still reeling from the effects of fighting the Opium War after a failed attempt to stem the British importing of opium into China proper (see Lin Zexu). The rate of opiate addiction increased from about .72 addicts per 1,000 people to a high of 4.59 per 1,000 in the 1890s. In 1906 the Pure Food and Drug Act requires that certain specified drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated. 1911: United States first Opium Commissioner, Hamilton Wright argues that of all the nations of the world, the United States consumes most habit-forming drugs per capita. 1913: The American Medical Association created a propaganda department to outlaw health fraud and quackery. In the same year, California outlawed cannabis. 1914: The first recorded instance of the United States enacting a ban on the domestic distribution of drugs is the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914. This act was presented and passed as a method of regulating the production and distribution of opiate-containing substances under the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, but a section of the act was later interpreted by law enforcement officials for the purpose of prosecuting doctors who prescribe opiates to addicts. 1919: Alcohol prohibition in the U.S. first appeared under numerous provincial bans and was eventually codified under a federal constitutional amendment in 1919, having been approved by 36 of the 48 U.S. states. 1925: United States supported regulation of cannabis as a drug in the International Opium Convention. and by the mid-1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis. 1930: The Federal Bureau of Narcotics was created. For the next 32 years it was headed by Harry J. Anslinger who came from the Bureau of Prohibition as did many of its initial members. 1932: Democrat Franklin Roosevelt ran for President of the United States promising repeal of federal laws of Prohibition of alcohol. 1933: Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is repealed. The amendment remains the only major act of prohibition to be repealed, having been repealed by the Twenty- first Amendment to the United States Constitution. 1935: President Roosevelt hails the International Opium Convention and application of it in US. law and other anti-drug laws in a radio message to the nation. 1937: Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act. Presented as a $1 nuisance tax on the distribution of marijuana, this act required anyone distributing the drug to maintain and submit a detailed account of his or her transactions, including inspections, affidavits, and private information regarding the parties involved. This law, however, was something of a \\"Catch-22\\", as obtaining a tax stamp required individuals to first present their goods, which was an action tantamount to confession. This act was passed by Congress on the basis of testimony and public perception that marijuana caused insanity, criminality, and death. 1951: The 1951 Boggs Act increased penalties fourfold, including mandatory penalties.History of drug legislation, The National Alliance of Advocates for Buprenorphine Treatment 1956: The Daniel Act increased penalties by a factor of eight over those specified in the Boggs Act. Although by this time there was adequate testimony to refute the claim that marijuana caused insanity, criminality, or death, the rationalizations for these laws shifted in focus to the proposition that marijuana use led to the use of heroin, creating the gateway drug theory. 1965, in Laos, the CIA's airline, Air America, is suspected of flying Hmong (Meo) opium out of the hills to Long Tieng and Vientiane to obtain hard currency for their otherwise unfunded Hmong war against the Viet Cong in 1971. During the Laotian Civil War, Long Tieng served as a town and airbase operated by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States. The Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia) became a mass producer of high-grade no. 4 heroin for the American market. The first ever head shop, Ron and Jay Thelin's Psychedelic Shop, opened on Haight Street on January 3, 1966, offering hippies a spot to purchase marijuana and LSD, which was essential to hippie life in Haight-Ashbury.Tamony, Peter. \\"Tripping out in San Francisco\\".

In 1969, psychiatrist Dr. Robert DuPont conducted a urinalysis of everyone entering the D.C. jail system in August 1969. He found 44% test positive for heroin and starts the first methadone treatment program in the Department of Corrections in September 1969 for heroin addicts. In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted into law by Congress. The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. This legislation is the foundation on which the modern drug war exists. Responsibility for enforcement of this new law was given to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and then, in 1973, to the newly formed Drug Enforcement Administration. During the Nixon era, for the only time in the history of the war on drugs, the majority of funding goes towards treatment, rather than law enforcement. In June 1971, the Vietnam War was linked with concerns over drugs. The Nixon administration coined the term War on Drugs.Thirty Years of America's Drug War, a Chronology.

In May, 1971 Congressmen Robert Steele (R-CT) and Morgan Murphy (D-IL) released a report on the growing heroin epidemic among U.S. servicemen in Vietnam.

Later in May 1971, the U.S. military announced they will begin urinalysis of all returning servicemen. The program goes into effect in September. 4.5% of the soldiers test positive for heroin. 1972, March 22: The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse recommended legalizing possession and sales of small amounts of marijuana. This recommendation is ignored. 1974: A Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on The Marihuana- hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security invited 21 scientists from seven different countries, including Gabriel G. Nahas and Nils Bejerot, to testify about the dangers of the drug.Marihuana-hashish epidemic and its impact on United States security: hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety- third Congress, second session [-Ninety-fourth Congress, first session] .. (1974) 1979: Illegal drug use in the U.S. peaked when 25 million of Americans used an illegal drug within the 30 days prior to the annual survey. 1986: The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was enacted into law by Congress. It changed the system of federal supervised release from a rehabilitative system into a punitive system. The bill enacted new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs, including marijuana. 1988: Near the end of the Reagan administration, the Office of National Drug Control Policy was created for central coordination of drug-related legislative, security, diplomatic, research and health policy throughout the government. In recognition of his central role, the director of ONDCP is commonly known as the Drug Czar. The position was raised to cabinet- level status by Bill Clinton in 1993. 1990: The Solomon‚ÄìLautenberg amendment is enacted. As a result, many states pass \\"Smoke a joint, lose your license\\" laws to punish any drug offense with a mandatory six month driver's license suspension. 1992: Illegal drug use in the U.S. fell to 12 million people. 1993, December 7: Joycelyn Elders, the Surgeon General, said that the legalization of drugs \\"should be studied\\", causing a stir among opponents.https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/us/surgeon-general-suggests- study-of-legalizing- drugs.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh;=6BA2C180190D42FF33E223D76810E97B&gwt;=pay 1998: The government commissioned the first-ever full study of drug policy, to be carried out by the National Research Council (NRC); the Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs is headed by Econometrician Charles Manski. 2001: The National Research Council Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs was published. The study revealed that the government had not sufficiently studied its own drug policy, which it called \\"unconscionable\\". (see more under Efficacy of the War on Drugs) 2001: 16 million in the U.S. were drug users. 2008 Several reports stated the benefits of drug courts compared with traditional courts. Using retrospective data, researchers in several studies found that drug courts reduced recidivism among program participants in contrast to comparable probationers between 12% to 40%. Re-arrests were lower five years or more later. The total cost per participant was also much lower. Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that the Actual youth drug use, as measured as the percent reporting past month use has declined from 19,4% to 14,8% among middle and high school students between 2001 and 2007. 2009 Gil Kerlikowske, the current Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, signaled that the Obama Administration would not use the term \\"War on Drugs,\\" as he claims it is counter-productive and is contrary to the policy favoring treatment over incarceration in trying to reduce drug use. \\"Being smart about drugs means working to treat people who go to jail with a drug problem so when they get out and return to the communities you protect, you will be less likely to re- arrest them\\". 2010 California Proposition 19 (also known as the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act) was defeated, with 53.5% of California voters voting \\"No\\" and 46.5% voting \\"Yes.\\" 2010 The Fiscal Year 2011 National Drug Control Budget proposed by the Obama Administration devoted significant new resources, $340 million, to the prevention and treatment of drug abuse. 2012 Colorado and Washington (state) passed laws to legalize the consumption, possession, and sale of marijuana. 2014 Alaska, Minnesota and Oregon passed laws to legalize the consumption, possession, and sale of marijuana. 2016 recreational marijuana use was legalized in California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine. 2018 Michigan passed laws legalizing the consumption, possession, and sale of marijuana See also * Drugs in the United States * Foreign policy of the United States * Drug prohibition * Timeline of cannabis legalization in the United States References Category:Drug policy of the United States Category:History of drug control ","title":"History of United States drug prohibition"},{"id":"26089081","text":"Stelios Longras() born 17 August 1976 in Nicosia, Cyprus is a Cypriot football defender who last played for Olympiakos Nicosia after serving as captain for APEP Pitsilia for many years.

These are effects that tend to occur only during parts of a waveform fed through audio amplifiers, that may give rise to audible degradation of the sound quality in music, even when fixed-frequency harmonic distortion tests show low amounts of distortion for a simple sinewave test signal. TIM (Transient Intermodulation Distortion) was first discovered by Dr. Matti Otala in the 1960s due to accidentally wiring an amplifier incorrectly.

Angel's Diary claimed as a new presence in Indonesia with high drama editing and shooting classes with wide-screen movies.http://iphototv.blogspot.com/2009/10/angels-diary-trans-tv.html  Cast  * Angelica Faustina as Angelique Smith Ferguson * Dimas Aditya as Satria * Kiki Rizky as Ryan * Dhanya Nilawati as Poppy * Rita Hasan as Rita Wibowo * Zoffy Melza Ibrahim as Zoppy * Mathias Muchus as Satria's Father  Synopsis   Season 1  Angel (Angelica Faustina) is a 19-year-old Australian- Indonesian young woman (her mother is a native of Indonesia while her father is an Australian) who had lived in Australia for 10 years. When her family finds out that she is dating a member of an Australian band, Angel is ordered to live in Jakarta, Indonesia in fear of the negative influences surrounding her relationship. In Jakarta, Angel lives with her fastidious and sassy aunt, Rita Wibowo (Rita Hasan) and her impish and rude young cousin, Zoppy (Zoffy Melza Ibrahim). Due to culture shock, Angel has to adapt to a completely different environment not only in her new campus but also in Jakarta in general. In the midst of these difficulties, she always carries a laptop to write and vent her experiences in her personal blog. In her new university, Angel becomes best friends with Poppy (Dhanya Nilawati), who helps Angel in adjusting her life. She also gets into conflict with the arrogant and very rich fellow student, Nadia (Sally Adelia), and her assistant, Carolina (Zaneta Georgina), who often bully Angel and Poppy. Angel also meets and becomes attracted to Satria (Dimas Aditya), an aloof male student who once offers her a handkerchief to clean herself after a round of bully from Nadia and helps her fixing her laptop. While Satria at first ignores Angel, he cools over his demeanor overtime. In the meantime, Angel becomes the target of affection from Nadia's boyfriend, Ryan (Kiki Rizky), after initially teasing her. However, after several conflicts with both Angel and Nadia and the fact that Angel ultimately does not love him, Ryan exiles himself to the countryside to rethink about himself. After Ryan's departure, Angel becomes even more closer to Satria, who slowly realizes he has fallen in love with her; this earns contempt from Carolina as she is in love with Satria. During a fatal prank from Nadia and Carolina, Angel is badly injured when she falls off the stairs and enters a coma. A great deal of anguish ensues between people close to Angel, including Satria, whose professes his love to Angel right before she wakes up. Angel learns from her mother who came from Australia that she is a foster child; her biological mother, Maya, is still alive and currently living somewhere in Jakarta; however, Angel cannot find her despite her extensive search. She does, however, learn that she shares the same maternal grandparents as Nadia, making them cousins; this horrifies Nadia over all the things she has done to Angel. Meanwhile, a new male student, the cheerful and protective Andhika (Roby Sutanto), appears to complicate Angel and Satria's relationship, as Angel falls in love with and dates Andhika. Carolina, teaming up with Nadia's mother who wants Angel dead to prevent her from receiving her father's will, sets up a complex plan to kidnap Angel, which leads to Andhika being mortally wounded and died during his attempt to rescue her, right after the campus graduation. Carolina also forces Satria to marry her by falsely accusing him of making her pregnant. However, Angel and Nadia's grandfather is revealed to have left most of his fortune to Angel in his will, making Nadia's mother mad and declared insane. Satria also sees through Carolina's lie and quickly leaves her to meet Angel, who decides to return to Australia after graduation, depressed over Andhika's death. Meeting her in Andhika's grave, he convinces her to stay as well as promising Andhika that he will take care of Angel. Convinced, Angel decides to stay and start a relationship with Satria.  Season 2  Angel starts a new life after graduation in her luxurious house left to her by her grandfather's will. She occupies the house with Poppy, while her aunt and cousin, Rita and Zoppy respectively, visit her occasionally to \\"loot\\" her food. She is also in a relationship with Satria. Angel eventually finds a job at a magazine company, but she has to fend herself from her old nemesis, Carolina, who also works at the same office and wants to crush Angel's life.

Color image on the left acquired in July 1999. The gray scale image on the right taken in November 1999. Tawhaki Patera is an active volcano on Jupiter's moon Io. It is located on Io's leading hemisphere at within the equatorial plains of western Media Regio. Tawhaki is an Ionian patera, a type of volcanic crater similar to a caldera, wide and deep. Tawhaki Patera was first seen as a dark spot in low-resolution Voyager 1 in March 1979. However, volcanic activity was not observed at Tawhaki until September 1997 when a bright thermal hotspot was observed at near-infrared wavelengths while Io was in the shadow of Jupiter by the camera on the Galileo spacecraft. Tawhaki would also be observed as a hotspot while Io was in eclipse in November 1997 during Galileo's eleventh orbit. The high temperature period of the eruption at Tawhaki ceased by May 1998. It is uncertain whether this delay is due to real changes in activity at Tawhaki or the poor resolution of the Voyager data and Galileo data from the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS). Tawhaki Patera is one of several volcanoes suspected of being responsible for the August 2, 1999 9908A outburst eruption, one of the most energetic observed on Io. However, the low-resolution of the ground-based observation precludes a definitive identification of the source volcano of the eruption beyond that it was located in northwestern Media Regio on Io's leading hemisphere. The NIMS instrument did detect a thermal hotspot between one and five micrometres at Tawhaki during Galileo's 21st orbit in July 1999, a month prior to the eruption. The southern half of Tawhaki Patera was observed by Galileo at 260 meters per pixel during an encounter with Io on November 26, 1999, providing the highest resolution image of this volcano. This along with a color observation taken in July 1999, showed that the floor of Tawhaki contained some of the darkest material in the area, suggesting the cooled lava at Tawhaki is very young, consistent with the activity seen during the Galileo mission. A lava channel, later named Tawhaki Vallis was also found to the southeast. The channel maybe related to earlier activity at Tawhaki Patera, but the images of the region cut off the northern half of the volcano and channel, preventing a relationship between the two volcanic features to be established. In August 2001, NIMS once again observed a low level of activity at Tawhaki Patera. The volcano was formally named Tawhaki Patera by the International Astronomical Union in 2000 after the MƒÅori lightning god, TƒÅwhaki. The Galileo imaging team suggested the name Hine-i-tapeka Patera, but Tawhaki Patera was chosen instead.

He won a single cap for Wales under the rugby union code and then represented his country at rugby league in two matches between 1910 and 1911. Despite winning only one cap, he became a Triple Crown winning player when he played in the opening game of the 1909 Home Nations Championship. Rugby career Blackmore first came to note as a rugby player when he joined Abertillery in 1902.Thomas (1983), pg 17. Blackmore stayed with Abertillery for the majority of his amateur career, spending just two seasons outside the team when he left after a disagreement with the club. During these two seasons he represented first Tredegar, and then Blaina, before returning to Abertillery.Thomas (1983), pg 91. In 1906 Blackmore was chosen to represent Monmouthshire county, and was part of the team that faced the South African national team on their first overseas tour. In 1907, Blackmore faced his second national team, this time the first touring Australian team, but on this occasion with his club side Abertillery. This was the first national team to visit Abertillery Park, and Blackmore was part of the team to force the Australians to a 3-3 draw.Thomas (1983), pg 25. In 1909 Blackmore won his first full test cap when he was selected for the Wales team to face England in the opening game of the 1909 Home Nations Championship. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Blackmore was the only new cap into the team, and joined Abertillery teammate, Jim Webb in the pack. The game ended in a Welsh victory, and although Blackmore played no further part in the campaign, he became a Triple Crown winning player after Wales won the remaining two games of the competition. In 1910, Blackmore decided to turn professional, and left Abertillery to join English rugby league team, Hull Kingston Rovers. He played his first game for Hull Kingston Rovers on 3 September 1910, facing Dewsbury.Jenkins (1991), pg 22. Three months later, on 10 December, Blackmore was selected for the Wales rugby league team, in a game against England at Coventry. Wales lost 13-39.Gate (1986), pg 141. Blackmore was reselected for Wales in the next league international, which Wales again lost to England, but this time on Welsh soil at Ebbw Vale. Jake Blackmore played as a forward, i.e. number 10, in Hull Kingston Rovers' 10-22 defeat by Huddersfield in the 1911‚Äì12 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1911‚Äì12 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 25 November 1911, in front of a crowd of 20,000.Irvin Saxton (publish date tbc) \\"History of Rugby League ‚Äì ‚Ññ 17 ‚Äì 1911‚Äì12\\".

It is primarily designed to relay a spacecraft's \\"health\\" information, and secondarily its telecommunications status, using a simple signal that can be detected with a moderately-sized antenna. Beacon mode also enables spacecraft to communicate with one another on a daily basis, allowing for one spacecraft to act as a data proxy for another. The CCSDS tone beacon mode configures the transceiver to transmit a CW tone. It can be used to signal other spacecraft to transmit their data to an orbiter; however, its primary function is to transmit spacecraft health information. Addressing multiple spacecraft is accomplished by using four unique CW frequencies with 16 possible tones, used somewhat like DTMF signaling technology. In the outer solar system, UHF frequencies are not used; instead, the primary (or backup) transmitter is programmed to transmit the required tone (generally in the X or Ku band). Spacecraft may respond in any transmit configuration compatible with valid orbiter receive configurations, but outside the beacon mode service.  History  The beacon mode service is a new technological solution to the old problem of having to set up an active 2-way communication path with spacecraft beyond Earth orbit and more than 30 light-minutes away. It originated during the 1990s, when spacecraft transmitters became complex enough to support the service, and deep-space missions became too numerous for each to receive daily communications.Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol - Data Link Layer  Current practice  NASA generally prefers that missions use eight or fewer tones, as the New Horizons mission uses. CCSDS specifications support 16 beacon-mode tones, but this is to future proof the protocol. Typical operating parameters: Tone # # Test tone; # Nothing to report; # Ready to report; # Need help with a minor onboard problem; # Need help with an onboard problem that is hindering operations; # In safe mode due to a severe onboard problem.CCSDS Documents specifying tone protocol  Craft using beacon mode  This list is incomplete, and does not cover geosynchronous craft: * Deep Space 1 was the first spacecraft to use the service. * New Horizons mission to Pluto, used for its 6-plus years of cruise-mode operation. * Mars Rovers, for daily data uplink notification to orbiters. Both Rovers are using the Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol to relay data to Earth and use beacon mode to signal that they have data to uplink. Terminated missions which used the service: * Phoenix ‚Äì The Phoenix lander descended to Mars on May 25, 2008. Mission scientists used instruments aboard the lander to search for environments suitable for microbial life on Mars.  Civil and military use  There is no provision against civil telecommunications or military spacecraft using the beacon mode service; all CCSDS protocols are open to civilian and military use. Some satellite telecom providers have used their own forms of beacon mode service on their own craft; however, the CCSDS standard may in time displace some homebrew versions of the technology which have been deployed in the space sector outside governmental space agencies.  CCSDS frequency allocation  In deep-space service, the spacecraft's primary transmitter downlink frequency is used for the beacon mode service. However, for orbiter-lander missions there is a specific frequency allocation for the service. The four orbiter- lander CW beacon mode frequencies for use with the Proximity-1 protocol are * 437.1000 MHz * 440.7425 MHz * 444.3850 MHz * 448.0275 MHz The lander CW beacon frequency is 401.585625 MHz.

Born into a Jewish family with many children, Brauner moved in 1913 to Vienna with his family, where they stayed for two years. When they returned to Romania, they lived first in BrƒÉila, and later in Bucharest. There he studied at the Music Academy, having as teachers, among others, Constantin BrƒÉiloiu, Dumitru Georgescu Kiriac and Stefan Popescu. In 1927, he was named secretary of the Composers' Society's so-called Folklore Archives. Brauner was one of those who discovered Romanian folk music diva Maria TƒÉnase in the mid-1930s. He eventually became her official biographer. During the war, he was a teacher at a Jewish high school in Bucharest, in 1944 he became music adviser at the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company in charge of folklore, and in 1949 he became head of the Folklore Department at the Music Academy in Bucharest. Brauner was implicated in the show trial against Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, and spent 12 years in prison, most of it in solitary confinement. He was released from prison in 1962, sent into internal exile to a village near Slobozia. He married Lena Constante in 1964. In 1966, he was allowed to travel to the Venice Biennale, Italy, where his brother Victor Brauner exhibited some of his works at the French pavilion. In 1967, after being named a member of the Paris Music Biennale, he was allowed to travel to Paris, where he became acquainted with Marc Chagall. In 1968, both he and Lena Constante were rehabilitated and given a meager pension for their sufferings. A close collaborator of Constantin BrƒÉiloiu, Brauner recorded about 5000 Romanian folk songs.

De la Mare won the annual Carnegie Medal recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. It was the first collection to win the award and the first time that previously published material had been considered.Keith Barker, In the Realms of Gold: The Story of the Carnegie Medal, Julia MacRae Books, 1986. Stories The collection comprises 17 stories. * Dick and the Beanstalk: Dick discovers Jack's old beanstalk and climbs it to find the land of the giants, who have less than fond memories of Jack * The Dutch Cheese: a stubborn young farmer offends the playful woodland fairies, and his sister has to negotiate with them for a peaceful life * A Penny a Day: a dwarf helps a young girl with her household tasks, for a price * The Scarecrow: an elderly man tells his niece of the time he saw a fairy perching on a scarecrow * The Three Sleeping Boys of Warwickshire: three apprentice chimney-sweeps escape their cruel master in their dreams, but when he stops their souls returning to their bodies, they fall into an enchanted sleep which lasts for fifty-three years. This has been described as \\"the best of all modern short fairy-tales... a simple story but absorbing and beautifully told\\". * The Lovely Myfanwy: a doting father keeps his lovely daughter in virtual imprisonment, but the rumour of her beauty spreads far and wide * Lucy: three ageing sisters fall on hard times but the youngest finds she prefers her new life * Miss Jemima: an old lady tells her granddaughter about the time long ago when she was very nearly enticed away by a fairy * The Magic Jacket: a benevolent admiral gives the jacket which had brought him luck and success to a young pavement artist * The Lord Fish: a lazy young man who loves fishing strays into a strange land where he meets a girl who is half-fish, and is turned into a fish himself * The Old Lion: in Africa a sailor is given an extraordinary monkey who becomes a phenomenal success on the stage in London * Broomsticks: an old lady becomes suspicious of her beloved cat * Alice's Godmother: Alice's ancient godmother offers to share the secret of her long life * The Maria-Fly: Maria has an unusual experience with a fly, but none of the people she tells about it understand what she felt * Visitors: Tom sees some strange birds which change his life * Sambo and the Snow Mountains: Sambo doses himself with every kind of medicine in his attempt to become white * The Riddle: some children play with an old wooden chest although they have been warned to stay away Illustrations Irene Hawkins was the original illustrator. She had illustrated several of the author's early collections and Muriel M. Green said in 1948 review of Collected Stories, \\"Mr de la Mare is especially fortunate in having found, in Irene Hawkins, an illustrator who can interpret his work so perfectly, and this volume is enhanced by her charming illustrations.\\"Muriel M. Green, \\"The Children's Book Section\\", Library Review 11.6 (1948), pp. 405‚Äì07. For the 1957 edition new illustrations were commissioned from Robin Jacques, a highly regarded illustrator of fairy-tales. Marcus Crouch considers these line- drawings among Jacques' best work, artistically emphasising the homeliness of de la Mare's world.Marcus Crouch, Treasure Seekers and Borrowers: Children's Books in Britain 1900‚Äì1960, The Library Association, 1962, p. 134. Literary significance and reception In the decade after the First World War some of the best work for children was in poetry, fantasy and poetic fantasy,John Rowe Townsend, Written for Children: An Outline of English-Language Children's Literature, Third revised edition, Penguin 1987, p. 144. and there was a spate of original stories in the folk-tale manner.Crouch, p. 46. Walter de la Mare, primarily a poet, published several short books of such stories for children in the 1920s and 1930s, and the best of his tales were brought together in his Collected Stories for Children. The stories range over a variety of subjects, but all have the touch of tender, dream-like melancholy which is the hallmark of the author's work in general. Roger Lancelyn Green described Walter de la Mare's stories as having a strong but very particular appeal: \\"These strange, homely tales of wonder captivate a limited audience ‚Äì and are frequently foisted on children by adults who have fallen under their very real spell. It is a spell, however, and one of selective magic, catching some readers away into the true lands of enchantment, and boring others to distraction.\\"Roger Lancelyn Green, Tellers of Tales, Edmund Ward, 1965 edition, p. 270. The award of the Carnegie Medal was unexpected, as none of the stories were new, but the collection was considered to give an opportunity for assessing and acknowledging \\"the achievement of the most gifted writer of the century who had dedicated his finest powers to delighting children\\".

It was opened by the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway in 1841. The main line was extended from Kemble to a junction near Gloucester in 1845, by the GWR which had taken over the C&GWUR.; The branch supported a busy passenger and goods business, but these declined in the 1930s, and closure was threatened in the 1950s. To reduce costs and maintain the viability of the line, lightweight four-wheel diesel railbuses were introduced, and they proved popular. Nevertheless the decline in business was inexorable, and the passenger service closed in 1964; the goods service was ended in the following year. The route crossed the River Thames near its source and formed the highest rail crossing point on the river. Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway The Cirencester line in 1841The Great Western Railway opened its main line between London and Bristol in 1841.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 131 During the construction period, an independent company called the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway obtained authorisation on 21 June 1836 to make a line from the GWR at Swindon, to Cheltenham by way of Stroud and Gloucester. The estimated cost of construction was ¬£750,000.MacDermot, volume I, pages 135 and 136 As well as the main line between Swindon and Cheltenham, there was to be a branch to Cirencester, terminating at a place there referred to as Botany Bay. A landowner at Kemble, named Robert Gordon, was evidently hostile to the railway, and he secured clauses in the authorising Act requiring a tunnel, not needed for engineering purposes, near Kemble. Moreover the railway was forbidden to open a public station on Gordon's estate. The new line was to be on the broad gauge.MacDermot, volume I, pages 164 to 167 The money market was extremely depressed in the period following authorisation of the line, and subscriptions could not be secured to make material progress on construction. In desperation, the directors determined to construct between Swindon and Cirencester only for the time being, for that would give the best chance of getting an income that would pay a dividend on the outlay. The company arranged a provisional lease with the Great Western Railway, in which the GWR would pay ¬£17,000 annually for the use of the (as yet unbuilt) line. The Bristol and Gloucester Railway was relying on timely completion of the C&GWUR; at the Gloucester and Cheltenham end of the line, and obtained Parliamentary clauses in C&GWUR; Acts pressuring the Cheltenham company to complete at the Gloucester end of the line, and the emphasis on early construction passed to that area. In November 1840 even that work proved impossible to finance, and attention reverted to the Swindon end of the line. Thames & Severn Canal|alt= Progress was eventually made, and the line opened between Swindon and Cirencester on 31 May 1841. It was a single broad gauge line; stations were at Purton, Minety and Cirencester, so there was no intermediate station on what was to be the branch line. The line was leased to the GWR as arranged, for a period of seven years.MacDermot, volume I, pages 170 to 175 In 1842 the C&GWUR; obtained Parliamentary authorisation to sell their line to the GWR. The main line company was not yet ready to purchase, but after a delay the transfer was agreed in January 1843. The actual amalgamation took place on 1 July 1843; the GWR spent ¬£230,000 in the acquisition of the line, which so far had cost the C&GWUR; ¬£600,000 to construct. The Cirencester branch in 1845The GWR did not hasten to complete the line, but it opened from Kemble to Standish Junction, joining the Bristol line there, on 12 May 1845.MacDermot, volume I, page 184 Kemble thus became the junction station for what was now the Cirencester branch. Robert Gordon's restrictive clauses prevented the opening of a public station there, and the GWR contented itself with an exchange station, not accessible for joining and leaving passengers or goods. Tetbury was served by a station named Tetbury Road, located on the main line immediately north of the Cirencester to Tetbury road, just outside Gordon's estate (and near the present-day Thames Head public house).Vaughan comments that Kemble station never had a goods terminal; goods traffic was handled at Tetbury Road, later renamed Coates.C J Gemmell, GWR Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Co., Sparkford, 1995, , pages 92 and 93 Gauge conversion The Cirencester branch had been opened as a broad gauge line. The GWR undertook a widespread conversion to narrow (standard) gauge in the general area in 1872, and the Cirencester branch was closed on 22 May for the conversion work and reopened as a standard gauge line on 27 May. Passengers were conveyed by omnibus to and from Tetbury Road station during the closure.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II, 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, page 64 Cirencester station The station originally had an overall roof, but this was removed in 1874. Kemble station Kemble railway station before 1905; the Cirencester branch line is on the right Kemble station was fully open to the public on 1 May 1882.Colin G Maggs, Gloucestershire Railways, Halsgrove, Wellington, 2010, , pages 144 to 146 Signalling improvements In 1908, the Webb-Thompson electric train staff system was installed on the branch. The Cirencester line was controlled from Kemble East signalbox and Cirencester. During 1929 Kemble East signalbox was abolished, and a new 62 lever Kemble signalbox installed. Because of the curvature of the platform at Kemble there was an auxiliary staff instrument on the platform. In 1936, there were eleven passenger trains each way daily, as well as three goods trains. By 1954, the passenger service was reduced to nine trains daily.Adrian Vaughan, GWR Junction Stations, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1988, , pages 45, 47, 48, 50, and 52 to 54 Train service in 1922 A diesel railbus at Cirencester Town station in 1962In 1922, there were ten trains daily, but no Sunday service.Peter Dale, Gloucestershire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2002, , pages 6 and 7 Cirencester station renovation In 1956, work was carried out towards renovation of Cirencester station, but the work was suspended, leaving the buildings in a partly completed state. Diesel railbuses The branch in 1959 In an attempt to save the line from closure, diesel railbuses were introduced on the line in February 1959 to reduce costs. The train service was increased to fourteen trains per day and halts were opened at Chesterton Lane and, in January 1960, at Park Leaze. Results were encouraging: 130,000 passengers yearly, an average of about 13 per train. Particularly on Saturdays, the railbus was overcrowded. The original intention was to run railbuses through to Swindon to avoid a change of trains at Kemble, but this proved impossible as the lightweight vehicles did not reliably operate the signalling track circuits on the main line. Nevertheless, despite the initial success, the passenger service was not financially viable, and it was withdrawn on 6 April 1964. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 4 October 1965. After closure Cirencester Town former railway stationA Cirencester ring road was built on part of the railway in the mid 1970s. Future As of 2016, discussions have taken place regarding the potential of relaying 5km of track from Kemble station to the edge of Cirencesterhttp://m.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/14507152.Cirencester_railway_plans_steaming_ahead_after_Government_meeting/ at Chesterton Halt. In January 2019, the Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line as Priority 2 for reopening.

He is best known for his contracts with the Mexican government to kill or capture Apache Indians. James Kirker, 1847 by Thomas Martin Easterly Early life Kirker was born in Killead, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, to an Ulster Scots family, but left for New York City, United States, at the age of 16 to avoid conscription in the Royal Navy. In an ironic twist, he became a \\"legal\\" American privateer to raid British ships off the East Coast of the United States in the War of 1812. He was a privateer for a year, but returned to New York in 1813 and married Catherine Donigan and had a son, James B. Kirker. In 1817, Kirker abandoned his family to go to St. Louis, Missouri with several kinsmen. In St. Louis, Kirker worked as a merchant.Smith, Ralph A. \\"Kirker, James.\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 16 Jul 2012 In 1822, Kirker joined a William Henry Ashley fur trapping expedition up the Missouri River. In 1824, he followed the Santa Fe Trail to New Mexico and spent winters during the next decade trapping and trading beaver pelts in the southern Rocky Mountains. He began working at the Santa Rita mine near Silver City, New Mexico in 1826 and escorted wagon trains of copper to Chihuahua, Mexico. In 1833, without divorcing his first wife,he married Rita Garcia and in 1835 he became a Mexican citizen. The couple had three sons and a daughter. He became known in Mexico as Santiago Querque or Quirque. Kirker is described as a \\"large, agile man,\\" fearless, an excellent marksman and horseman. He was considered during his lifetime as having \\"great enterprise and vision.\\" The scalp hunter Kirker had become familiar and friendly with the Apache during his years of work and travel. He sold arms and ammunition to them and was alleged to have accompanied Apache bands on livestock raids into Mexico. Beginning in 1831, Apache raids became a serious problem in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora. In December 1839, Kirker was given a contract by the government of Chihuahua to fight Apaches. He was authorized to raise 200 men and would be paid for Apache prisoners.Griffen, William B. Utmost Good Faith: Patterns of Apache-Mexican Hostilities in Northern Chihuahua Border Warfare, 1821-1848 Albuquerque: U of NM Press, p. 58 The core group of his force was about 25 men, called \\"Sahuanos\\" (Shawnees) which included Anglos, Mexicans, escaped Black slaves and Shawnee, Delaware, and Creek Indians, including his second in command, a Shawnee named Spybuck.Often called \\"Skybuck\\" but Spybuck is more likely given that a well-known Shawnee family is named Spybuck. \\"James Kirker, the King of New Mexico\\" http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS?scalpin/children.html, accessed 13 Jul 2012 Kirker's first operation in 1840 was to kill 10 Apache men and take 20 women and children prisoners from a group that had begun peace negotiations with Mexican authorities. He continued to have some successes killing and capturing Apache, but Apache raids increased in 1841 rather than decreased. Kirker was reemployed in 1846 and he and local Mexicans were responsible for a massacre of 130 peaceful Apache at Galeana, Chihuahua. Kirker claimed that he had followed the trail of stolen livestock to the Apache encampment.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith pp. 58‚Äì61, 119, 171‚Äì172, However, the bankrupt Chihuahua government could not afford to continue paying Kirker and offered him instead a commission as Colonel in the Mexican Army. Kirker turned down the offer. In ill repute and with the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War inflaming public opinion against Anglo-Americans, Kirker fled Mexico.

Life Pez was born in Munich. From 1676, he was the tower watchman and later the choir director at the Church of Saint Peter in Munich. In 1688, he became a musician at the court of prince Maximilian Emmanuel, Elector of Bavaria who offered him the opportunity to pursue his musical studies in Rome with the leading Italian composer Arcangelo Corelli. In 1694, Pez was in the service of Joseph Clemens, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne at his residence in Bonn, working to improve the prince's chapel orchestra. In 1695, he became Kapellmeister and advisor to the prince. Returning to Munich in 1701, he remained for five years at the court's chapel. In the 1690s, Max Emmanuel sent Pez to study composition and violin in Rome. While in Munich, Pez came to the attention of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, Eberhard Louis in the winter of 1705‚Äì06. Until Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor released the entire Bavarian Hofkapelle by Imperial fiat in May 1706, Pez had been charged with educating the Wittelsbach children in music, but he was hired asOberkapellmeister of the W√ºrttemberg Hofkapelle, a post he would hold until his death in 1716, on 12 November 1706. The Duke highly valued Pez's experience and training, and so paid him a generous salary of 2000 gulden that also included the wages for his daughter, Maria Anne Franziska Pez, and his personal copyist, Anton√ø Meister. Under Pez, the size of the Hofkapelle expanded, but especially in the range of instruments used and the number of musicians who could play more than one instrument and, even after financial woes and following retrenchments that shrank the Hofkapelle and his salary to 500 gulden,Owens 2011, p. 168 in the Duchy as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession and the ongoing construction of Ludwigsburg Palace, built a very skilled orchestra that he was quite proud of. Pez was, however, very worried about his small number of vocalists, the Catholic members therein sometimes not being present for some church performances (this he never mentioned to the Duke). Pez's Catholic faith, which demonstrated the tolerance of Duke Eberhard Louis when he hired him, also had a repercussion in that he was not required to provide housing for some of the court's choir boys () despite being their supervisor, and this foreshadowed a decline of their importance to the point where only two of them would be employed in the Hofkapelle by 1715. Work Like many of his contemporaries, Pez was heavily influenced by the French style, and he was one of many imitators of Jean- Baptiste Lully. Although largely forgotten today, Pez was mentioned in a lyric poem written by Georg Philipp Telemann in 1730, who placed him beside the names of composers like H√§ndel, as a grand composer of his era, singling out in particular the quality of his sonatas.

The China Daily stated regarding his essay about the park near where he lived, \\"Many critics have considered I and the Temple of Earth (:zh:Êàë‰∏éÂú∞Âùõ) as one of the best Chinese prose essays of the 20th century.\\" Shi was born in Beijing, and graduated from Tsinghua University High School. In 1969 he was a \\"sent- down youth\\" or urban youth sent to a rural area of Shaanxi as part of the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution. There he was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 21, and was sent back to Beijing. Shi was published for the first time in 1979. His 1983 short story \\"My Faraway Clear Peace River\\" (ÊàëÁöÑÈÅ•ËøúÁöÑÊ∏ÖÂπ≥Êπæ) won the National Excellent Short Story Prize. The story is about a sent-down youth and an old man of the village, and takes the view that the peasants suffer more over the long term than the urban youth sent from the city. A sequel, \\"A Story of Rustication\\" (\\"Chadui de gushi\\") was published in 1986. In 1980 director Tian Zhuangzhuang based a short film called Our Corner on a story by Shi; it was the first film by a filmmaker of China's Fifth Generation Cinema. Shi's 1985 novella \\"Like a Banjo String\\" (ÂëΩËã•Áê¥Âº¶) about a pair of blind musicians, was the basis of the 1991 film Life on a String directed by Chen Kaige. His collections of short stories include My Faraway Clear Peace River (Wo de yaoyuan de qingping wan) (1985) and Sunday (Libairi) (1988). A collection of English-language translations of his short stories was published in 1991 as Strings of Life. In 1996 his novel Notes on Principles (Âä°ËôöÁ¨îËÆ∞) was published. In selecting it as a notable work of Chinese literature since 1949 which could qualify as an overlooked classic, Professor Shelley W. Chan of Wittenberg University said Notes on Principles was similar to but better than Soul Mountain by Nobel Prize-winner Gao Xingjian. In 1998 his kidneys began to fail and he subsequently required dialysis three times weekly. He received the Lao She Literature Prize for Fragments Written at the Hiatuses of Sickness (ÁóÖÈöôÁ¢éÁ¨î)(2002). In 2006 he published My Sojourn in Ding Yi (ÊàëÁöÑ‰∏Å‰∏Ä‰πãÊóÖ), about an immortal spirit that inhabits the bodies of a succession of people, including Adam, Shi Tiesheng himself, and the book's hero, Ding Yi.

History  Originally named Twatley Manor, an abbreviation of \\"To the wet lea\\", Whatley Manor was originally a farmhouse on a farm estate called Twatley Farm which was built in the 18th century and first appeared on the Malmesbury Tithe Map in 1840. The estate was bought in 1857 by Mr T G Smith who from 1871 became the lord of Easton Grey Manor. It is believed that during this time the building was enlarged and several outbuildings to the northwest were incorporated or replaced, extending the property. Ownership of the farm passed to Smith's sister Honora Wilder and her husband Reverend George Wilder, who owned the farm in 1910. Rear admiral Reginald Neeld, his wife Beatrix and daughter lived in the manor house in 1899‚Äì1924. During the First World War, the hall at Twatley became a packing station for boxes of leggings, galoshes and Red Cross parcels destined for the Front. The estate was bought from Honora and George Wilder's heir, Graham Wilder, in 1925 by Herbert Choplin Cox, a Canadian. A Deputy Master of the Beaufort Hunt, he used the estate to hunt and added more land to it. In the 1920s, Cox altered the farmhouse and commissioned architect Septimus Warwick, who added a west wing now called the Tudor wing, greatly extended the stable courtyard and built the coach house. He also laid out ornamental gardens and a small park as well as constructing the Tower House and buildings which today are now part of Twatley Farm. H.C Cox died in 1945 and his executors sold the estate to Harold Issac Coriat and his wife Priscilla, who owned it until 1957. The house was designated as Grade II listed in 1951. In 1961 the estate was bought and divided by R.J. Rennie. It was around this time that the estate was renamed to Whatley Manor and Twatley Farm became a separate estate and home. In 1987 Whatley Manor became a hotel for the first time. Twatley Manor Farm, with buildings converted from Cox‚Äôs stables, is now owned by Mr J. E. Willis.  Landolt family  During this time, Marco and Alix Landolt stayed at Whatley Manor whilst visiting their son, Christian, who was competing at the Badminton Horse Trials. When Whatley Manor came up for sale in 2000 they acquired it and restored it. 12 acres of land have been transformed into 26 distinctive gardens, many of them based on the original 1930s plans. The house was renamed and redesigned into a Swiss-influenced interpretation of modern Cotswolds architecture, and added to by a construction team led by MITIE Group. There is a spa and health complex called the Aquarias Spa.  Awards  In October 2007, the 23-bedroom hotel, at the time part of the Relais & Chateaux group, was voted ninth \\"Best Holiday and Wellness Hotel in the World\\" (number one in the UK) by the Swiss business publication Bilanz. Since 2017, the hotel has been marketed through the Pride of Britain consortium. The hotel has three restaurants: The Dining Room, Grey's Brasserie and The Green Room. The Dining Room won its first Michelin star in 2005 under head chef Martin Burge, and a second star in 2010. Burge left Whatley Manor in 2016 and was replaced by Niall Keating who gained his first Michelin star in 2017 and was awarded European Young Chef of the Year in 2018. In October 2019 Keating's Dining Room regained its second Michelin star. Executive Head Chef Niall Keating competed in the 2020 series of the BBC television programme Great British Menu. He won the regional heat, and went on to win the fish course and receive the \\"champion of champions\\" award in the final.

He started his career as porn director and producer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when sellers of pornographic movies, including Falcon refused to mail them to customers in many southeastern states for legal reasons. In addition, he said in an interview, that gay porn movies were \\"so bad\\" that he decided to begin making them himself. In 1978, he was busted and his premises raided. Although the charges were later dropped, Higgins decided to go on a \\"world tour\\" looking for a better legal environment for his films. After rejecting Australia and Thailand as new venues, he settled in Amsterdam, where his distributor was, and later relocated to Prague, a less expensive city. Although the legal climate in the U.S. has changed, he had no interest in returning. His first film, \\"A Married Man\\", was produced in 1974. He went on to produce over 140 internationally distributed titles. His films won several Grabby Awards and he is in the GayVN Awards Hall of Fame.1998 GayVN Hall of Fame.

Placostylus ambagiosus is highly valued by Te Aup≈çuri me NgƒÅti Kurƒ´ (the indigenous people of northern New Zealand) as a food source, musical instrument and in the past this snail provided alarm calls at night warning of approaching invaders.  Distribution  This land snail species occurs in New Zealand. It is restricted to a small fragmented area of Northland Region, including the Aupouri Peninsula and Motuopao Island.  Biology  This snail feeds on fallen leaves on the forest floor. A favorite plant species is hangehange (Geniostoma ligustrifolium). Placostylus ambagiosus needs year round moisture provided by deep leaf-litter. The species is slow-growing with a lifespan of 10-22 years and strong site fidelity The same individual snail has been found under the same food plant for 12 years  Hypothetical subspecies  In 2011, Buckley et al. established, based on molecular phylogeny research and shell morphology research, that there are in fact no subspecies of Placostylus ambagiosus.Buckley T.

The House of Lords here ruled that an appropriation of property can occur even with the consent of the owner. To this end, they commented that the drafter's intentions in leaving out consent from the offence was to relieve the prosecution of establishing a lack of consent. Facts Upon arrival at London Victoria railway station an Italian student got into a taxi driven by the defendant. The student then handed the driver a piece of paper with the destination he wished to go to. The taxi driver informed him that it was a long and expensive journey,[1972] AC 626, at 626 and proceeded to take ¬£6 from the student's open wallet, ostensibly to cover the fare. Unknown to the student, who was not familiar with the area, the correct fare was just 10s 6d. (52.5p) Judgment The House of Lords upheld the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal, holding that a conviction under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 was correct. Four elements are required for an offence to fall under section 1: > A person is guilty of theft if he (1) dishonestly (2) appropriates (3) > property (4) belonging to another with the (5) intention of permanently > depriving the other of it; and 'thief' and 'steal' shall be construed > accordingly. Viscount Dilhorne interpreted these words as not requiring a lack of consent of the owner, stating that he saw: \\"no ground for concluding that the omission of the words \\"without the consent of the owner\\" was inadvertent and not deliberate,\\"[1972] AC 626, at 631 and that Parliament in omitting the words had simply removed the necessity for prosecutions to establish an appropriation was without an owner's consent.[1972] AC 626, at 632 On the issue of whether an appropriation could be consented to, Dilhorne elaborated: See also * R v Morris * R v Gomez * R v Hinks * Theft Act 1968 References Category:English criminal case law Category:House of Lords cases Category:1971 in case law Category:1971 in British law Category:History of the Metropolitan Police ","title":"Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissioner"},{"id":"26090336","text":"E. giganteus may refer to: * Edestus giganteus, the scissor-tooth shark, an extinct shark species that lived in the oceans during the Late Carboniferous * Equus giganteus, the giant prehistoric horse native to North America during the Pleistocene * Erythrochiton giganteus, a plant species endemic to Ecuador * Esacus giganteus, the beach stone-curlew or beach thick-knee, a large ground-dwelling bird found in Australasia * Eubrontes giganteus, the name of fossilised dinosaur footprints dating from the Late Triassic ","title":"E. giganteus"},{"id":"26090345","text":"Maria Tapuanoa Heather (died June 2003) was a Cook Islands politician and Member of the Cook Islands Parliament.

It is one of the pseudo- oxocarbon anions, as it can be described as a derivative of the croconate oxocarbon anion through the replacement of two oxygen atoms by dicyanomethylene groups =C(‚àíC‚â°N)2. Its systematic name is 3,5-bis(dicyanomethylene)-1,2,4-trionate. The term croconate violet as a dye name specifically refers to the dipotassium salt . History and synthesis The anion was synthesized and characterized by Alexander Fatiadi in 1978. He obtained the potassium salt by treating dipotassium croconate with malononitrile in water solution at 80‚Äì90 ¬∞C. Alexander J. Fatiadi (1978), \\"Synthesis of 1,3-(dicyanomethylene)croconate salts. New bond-delocalized dianion, \\"Croconate Violet\\"\\". Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 100 issue 8, pages 2586‚Äì2587. The dipotassium salt crystallizes from water as a dihydrate in deep blue metallic needles. The water solutions have an intense violet color and strongly stain the skin. Croconic acid violet The croconate violet anion is the conjugate base of the acid croconic acid violet , also obtained by Fatiadi in 1978 by treating the potassium salt with hydrochloric acid. It is an orange crystalline solid that melts at 260‚Äì270 ¬∞C and dissolves in water to give violet skin-staining solutions. It strongly acidic (pKa1 = 0.32 ¬± 0.02, pKa2 = 1.02 ¬± 0.02). From this acid other alkali metal salts can be prepared. The acid cannot be prepared directly from croconic acid and malononitrile; croconate blue is obtained instead. Properties Croconate violet salts are dyes with strong absorptions in the UV‚Äìvisible region. Solutions of the acid or of the dipotassium salt strongly stain the skin. It retains the aromatic character and some other properties of the croconate anion. Lawrence M. Doane, Alexander J. Fatiadi (2003) \\"Electrochemical Oxidation of Croconate Salts; Evidence of the Chemical Equivalence of the Carbonyl Oxygen Atom and the Dicyanomethylene Group\\" Croconate violet salts also have interesting electrochemical, semiconducting and photophysical properties, and have been the subject of research in supramolecular chemistry.

Inorganica Chimica Acta, Volume 359, Issue 7, Pages 2296‚Äì2302. The dipotassium salt for example is a semiconductor with electrical conductivity 2 √ó 10‚àí4 S cm‚àí1. The lithium salt is very soluble in water. The rubidium salt and the mixed rubidium-potassium salt crystallize as deep blue dihydrates in the triclinic space group, with the same structure. In these solids the croconate violet anion is almost planar, with the dicyanomethylene groups slightly twisted out of the mean plane. The aromatic character of the croconate core is retained or even enhanced, with strongly delocalized œÄ electrons. The tetra-n-butylammonium salt (N()4)2 is an anhydrous metallic green solid, stable to 225 ¬∞C, that is highly soluble in organic solvents (in contrast to the dipotassium salt). Wagner M.

It is the most terrestrial of the Caribbean land crabs, and is found from western Cuba across the Antilles as far east as Barbados. Common names for G. ruricola include the purple land crab, black land crab, red land crab, and zombie crab. Description Gecarcinus ruricola A male Gecarcinus ruricola Four colour morphs exist within the species: black, red, yellow and green. The carapace of G. ruricola grows in width at a rate of about per year, with the crabs reaching maturity after 5 years, and living for up to 10 years in total. G. ruricola have a number of adaptations to terrestrial life, mostly regarding water conservation. They are nocturnal, to prevent the hot sun from drying them out. They also have a \\"nephritic pad\\", onto which urine is released, in order to be cleaned by microbes before the water is then reabsorbed. Distribution G. ruricola is found across much of the Caribbean, from Cuba and the Bahamas in the west through the Antilles to Barbados in the east. It has been reported from Florida and Nicaragua, but few confirmed examples exist from the mainland; Loggerhead Key in the Dry Tortugas marks the northernmost limit of its island distribution, which extends across the Bahamas and Cuba, through the Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles, to Barbados. Outlying populations exist on Cura√ßao, in the Swan Islands off Honduras, Half Moon Caye of Belize, and in the Archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providencia and Santa Catalina off the Colombian coast. It can be found many kilometres from the sea, and at high altitudes: crabs have been observed above on the island of Dominica, and at over on Jamaica. Life cycle The eggs of G. ruricola hatch in the sea, where the larvae live as plankton. The return of the larvae to land seems to be infrequent, but when they do return, they return as megalopa larvae, in sufficient numbers to turn roads red. They move at a speed of , or faster if startled. For the next three years, the young crabs live in burrows inhabited by other crabs and eat food brought back to the burrow by the older crab. After mating, mass migrations occur with the females returning to the sea to release their fertilised eggs. An average female carries around 85,000 eggs. Ecology G. ruricola is an omnivorous scavenger, feeding mostly on nitrogen-poor plant matter. The meat of G. ruricola is rich in protein, and has often been harvested by local people. Other predators may include birds, although information is scarce. When confronted, they rear up and hold their open claws outwards in a defensive posture. Drosophila A pair of Drosophila endobranchiae on the carapace of Gecarcinus ruricola G. ruricola is the host organism for two species of commensal flies in the genus Drosophila. They were first observed on Montserrat by Henry Guernsey Hubbard in 1894, and presented at a scientific meeting later that year (where the crab was misidentified as Cardisoma guanhumi), but no further research was conducted until 1955, when specimens were again collected, this time from Mona Island, and named as Drosophila carcinophila by M. R. Wheeler. In 1967, a second species of fly, Drosophila endobranchia was discovered on Gecarcinus ruricola, although it also inhabits the closely related species Gecarcinus lateralis. Drosohila endrobranchia is not closely related to D. carcinophila, and this trait appears therefore to have evolved convergently. (A third species of fly, Lissocephala powelli has evolved a similar habit on Christmas Island, where it lives on the land crabs Gecarcoidea lalandii, Geograpsus crinipes and Cardisoma carnifex, and the terrestrial hermit crab Birgus latro.) D. endobranchia evolved from a group of species which breed on fungi or bark, while D. carcinophila evolved from a group which breed on cacti. The flies spend most of their lives on the crab, and are reluctant to leave. They do not need to flee predators, because the crabs they inhabit are fast animals and will flee: > The flies ‚Ä¶ hardly move at all, are extremely reluctant in leaving their > host crabs and are hard pushed to take flight. Although the flies are > sluggish, the crabs on which they reside are anything but. Chasing after > crabs through a pitch-black jungle (growing on a razor sharp labyrinthine > limestone ground), while trying to aspirate flies from their carapaces is > not trivial. Obtaining large amounts of flies in this way is simply a > nightmare. The eggs are laid around the crab's compound eyes; the first instar larvae migrate to the crab's nephritic pad, and live there, feeding on the microbes that cleanse the crab's urine. The second instar is spent in the crab's gill chamber. The third instar sees the larvae return to the mouthparts before falling to the ground to pupate. Linnaeus Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1758 (the starting point for zoological nomenclature), noting the species' annual migrations from the forests to the coast (Habitat in America, sylvas vastissimis agminibus quotannis deserens littora maris petiturus: \\"lives in America; every year, an army marches out of the forests towards the sea\\"). Philately G. ruricola appeared on two African postage stamps for the International Year of the Ocean in 1998, under the name \\"mountain crab\\". These were a Tanzanian stamp worth 500 shillingi and a Ugandan stamp worth 250 shillings.

He made his directorial debut in 2014 with the critically acclaimed Hrid Majharey, a Bengali feature film starring Abir Chatterjee and Raima Sen. Inspired by certain iconic plays of William Shakespeare, it was the first film in the Bengali language based on the works of the Bard and was presented as a tribute on his 450th Birth Anniversary. The movie was screened at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts in 2015, and was included in their Ph.D. in Cinema Studies (Shakespeare and Indian Cinema). Earlier in 2014, it had earned a rare recommendation from Film London in its list of world cinema based on Shakespearean plays. In another major achievement, the film and its screenplay were included in the UGC Literature Archive through the Shakespeare in Bengal project conducted by Jadavpur University. Ghosh had risen to prominence in 2011, by becoming the first and the only screenwriter, acclaimed director Aparna Sen had collaborated with in her illustrious career till date. Ghosh had made his screenwriting debut co-authoring Iti Mrinalini, the 2011 film that had also marked the acclaimed director's return to Bengali cinema after more than a decade. Early life Brought up in a Bengali family in a satellite township in West Bengal, Ranjan K Ghosh studied at St. Xavier's School, Durgapur and at BC Institution. Thereafter, he moved to Calcutta to take up Physics at Jadavpur University. Very soon he left his higher studies to become a mariner, and embarked on a career that would take him almost all around the world for the next four years. He holds a Degree in Nautical Sciences from The University of Mumbai. In 2007, Ranjan bid adieu to his sea- life and joined Mumbai based film school Whistling Woods International to study filmmaking. He graduated in 2009 with a major in screenwriting. Career While still in his film school, Ranjan worked as a script assistant on the National Film Award winning 2009 Bengali film Antaheen. He later assisted the director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury on the shoot of the same film. After graduating in 2009, Ghosh made his screenwriting debut co-authoring the story and screenplay of Iti Mrinalini, a 2011 Bengali film directed by Aparna Sen. The screenplay was a professional assignment in the film school course syllabus. Ifft was the first instance in Indian Screenwriting that any screenplay emerging from any Indian film institute was actually filmed. With this, Ranjan Ghosh went on to become Aparna Sen's first and only co-author till date. Considered a high-profile project, Iti Mrinalini - Aparna Sen's return to Bengali Cinema after a decade - also stars the director-actor along with her daughter Konkona Sen Sharma in the title role. Apart from co-writing the film, Ghosh assisted Aparna Sen in direction and on the production design. Reportedly, the entire memorabilia of the actress Mrinalini in the film has been designed and created by him, with some help from the art department. Post Iti Mrinalini, Ghosh collaborated with Prakash Jha, who is supposed to make his debut as a producer for Bengali films. The film is a loose adaptation of Jha's National Film Award winning 2003 Hindi film Gangaajal. The adapted story and screenplay has been penned by Ranjan. The yet untitled film is a comment on contemporary Bengal politics with the 1980 Bhagalpur blindings as the backdrop. Scheduled to go on floors in end 2010, the film has been facing delay owing to the stormy political scene in West Bengal. Ranjan Ghosh made his directorial debut with the critically acclaimed Abir Chatterjee-Raima Sen starrer Hrid Majharey in July, 2014. The movie had earned a rare recommendation from Film London in its list of world cinema based on Shakespearean plays. In another major achievement, the film and its screenplay went on to be included in the UGC Literature Archive through the Shakespeare in Bengal project conducted by Jadavpur University. Earlier in 2013, Hrid Majharey had already created history by becoming the first Bengali film to be shot in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands after a gap of almost 33 years. It was shot in 2013 in the Archipelagos. The last time was in 1979 when veteran filmmaker Tapan Sinha partly shot his Children's adventure film Sabuj Dwiper Raja in Port Blair.

History The Atienza castle is citadel of Andalusian origin that was in use up to the nineteenth century, when it began to deteriorate. Abundant archaeological sites from the Iron Age have been found, especially around Sig√ºenza. There are deposits in Santamera, Riosalido and Castilviejo de Guijosa. During the Romanization of Hispania in the second century BC, Sig√ºenza was one of the last Arevaci bastions to fall. Roman roads still exist in these environs and remains of mansions, cauponas, taverns and mutationes have been found in places like Mandayona, Palazuelos, Carabias and Alcuneza. There are few Visigoths remains, as in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, although regalia have been found in a cemetery in Palazuelos.

Castles in Alcorlo, Atienza, Bele√±a de Sorbe, Cogolludo, Riba de Santiuste and Sig√ºenza, as well as the Bujarrabal and Barbatona towers date back to the Andalusi period. From the twelfth century onward, after the Castilian conquest, rural Romanesque style was developed throughout the region, abundant examples of which survive to date, though significantly transformed in the seventeenth century. Atienza increased to fifteen churches, of which five of Romanesque origin remain today. Other examples of Romanesque present in the Pela highlands are the San Bartolome de Campis√°balos church, the San Pedro de Villacadima church and the Santa Coloma de Albendiego hermitage, with its prominent apse. In Sig√ºenza there are the San Vicente and Santiago churches.

The club currently operates three senior men's teams in the past there was a strong veterans side whose regular European Tour tradition has been carried on by the club's third team, The Beavers. There is a strong tradition of junior rugby and the club runs a full range of junior teams for both boys and girls. In addition, the club operates five netball teams.Club website History The club was founded in 1930 by former pupils of local Hipperholme Grammar School. As the school was endowed in the will of a local man, Matthew Brodley hence, the 'Old Brodleians' was chosen as the club's name. In the early years they struggled to raise a full team and almost went out of existence in 1934. By 1939 the Brods ran two teams and had established themselves as a prominent junior club with a reputation for scrappy rugby. When league rugby was introduced in 1987, Brods were placed in North East One. They stayed in that league until they were placed in Yorkshire 1 when the 1998 restructuring took place.club website history page They are back in Yorkshire 1 after a short spell in the North 1 East league, after achieving promotion from Yorkshire 1 at the end of the 2008-09 season. Grounds The club plays their matches at Woodhead ground in Hipperholme. A gas decontamination centre situated behind the council offices at Hipperholme was transformed into changing rooms and clubhouse after the war. Whilst these facilities were adequate the aim was to own and develop the club's own facilities. The chance to purchase the 18 acre (later extended to 23acre) Woodhead ground was taken supported by an RFU loan and in 1963 the old hut was erected. The hut was an old RAF hospital wooden structure purchased for ¬£700. It took two years but club members beavered away and a homely clubhouse with changing rooms and bath was the end result. Many members have fond memories of the old hut but 27 April 2003 marked the end of an era when Charlie Hodgson cut the ribbon to open the rebuilt clubhouse.Clubhouse development pictures The new clubhouse stands as a permanent memorial to Colin Green who wrote \\" Although it seemed obvious to me that the club must start to plan for gradual replacement of its timber framed clubhouse.

It is an instance of a scheme for numbering permutations and is an example of an inversion table. The Lehmer code is named in reference to Derrick Henry Lehmer, but the code had been known since 1888 at least. The code The Lehmer code makes use of the fact that there are :n!=n\\\\times(n-1)\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times2\\\\times1 permutations of a sequence of n numbers. If a permutation œÉ is specified by the sequence (œÉ1, ‚Ä¶, œÉn) of its images of 1, ‚Ä¶, n, then it is encoded by a sequence of n numbers, but not all such sequences are valid since every number must be used only once. By contrast the encodings considered here choose the first number from a set of n values, the next number from a fixed set of values, and so forth decreasing the number of possibilities until the last number for which only a single fixed value is allowed; every sequence of numbers chosen from these sets encodes a single permutation. While several encodings can be defined, the Lehmer code has several additional useful properties; it is the sequence :L(\\\\sigma)=(L(\\\\sigma)_1,\\\\ldots,L(\\\\sigma)_n)\\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad L(\\\\sigma)_i=\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{ j>i : \\\\sigma_j<\\\\sigma_i \\\\\\\\}, in other words the term L(œÉ)i counts the number of terms in (œÉ1, ‚Ä¶, œÉn) to the right of œÉi that are smaller than it, a number between 0 and , allowing for different values. A pair of indices (i,j) with and is called an inversion of œÉ, and L(œÉ)i counts the number of inversions (i,j) with i fixed and varying j. It follows that is the total number of inversions of œÉ, which is also the number of adjacent transpositions that are needed to transform the permutation into the identity permutation. Other properties of the Lehmer code include that the lexicographical order of the encodings of two permutations is the same as that of their sequences (œÉ1, ‚Ä¶, œÉn), that any value 0 in the code represents a right-to-left minimum in the permutation (i.e., a smaller than any to its right), and a value at position i similarly signifies a right-to-left maximum, and that the Lehmer code of œÉ coincides with the factorial number system representation of its position in the list of permutations of n in lexicographical order (numbering the positions starting from 0). Variations of this encoding can be obtained by counting inversions (i,j) for fixed j rather than fixed i, by counting inversions with a fixed smaller value rather than smaller index i, or by counting non-inversions rather than inversions; while this does not produce a fundamentally different type of encoding, some properties of the encoding will change correspondingly. In particular counting inversions with a fixed smaller value gives the inversion table of œÉ, which can be seen to be the Lehmer code of the inverse permutation. Encoding and decoding The usual way to prove that there are n! different permutations of n objects is to observe that the first object can be chosen in different ways, the next object in different ways (because choosing the same number as the first is forbidden), the next in different ways (because there are now 2 forbidden values), and so forth. Translating this freedom of choice at each step into a number, one obtains an encoding algorithm, one that finds the Lehmer code of a given permutation. One need not suppose the objects permuted to be numbers, but one needs a total ordering of the set of objects. Since the code numbers are to start from 0, the appropriate number to encode each object œÉi by is the number of objects that were available at that point (so they do not occur before position i), but which are smaller than the object œÉi actually chosen. (Inevitably such objects must appear at some position , and (i,j) will be an inversion, which shows that this number is indeed L(œÉ)i.) This number to encode each object can be found by direct counting, in several ways (directly counting inversions, or correcting the total number of objects smaller than a given one, which is its sequence number starting from 0 in the set, by those that are unavailable at its position). Another method which is in-place, but not really more efficient, is to start with the permutation of {0, 1, ‚Ä¶ } obtained by representing each object by its mentioned sequence number, and then for each entry x, in order from left to right, correct the items to its right by subtracting 1 from all entries (still) greater than x (to reflect the fact that the object corresponding to x is no longer available). Concretely a Lehmer code for the permutation B,F,A,G,D,E,C of letters, ordered alphabetically, would first give the list of sequence numbers 1,5,0,6,3,4,2, which is successively transformed : \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf1&5&0&6&3&4&2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&\\\\mathbf4&0&5&2&3&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&4&\\\\mathbf0&4&2&3&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&4&0&\\\\mathbf3&1&2&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&4&0&3&\\\\mathbf1&2&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&4&0&3&1&\\\\mathbf1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&4&0&3&1&1&\\\\mathbf0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} where the final line is the Lehmer code (at each line one subtracts 1 from the larger entries to the right of the boldface element to form the next line). For decoding a Lehmer code into a permutation of a given set, the latter procedure may be reversed: for each entry x, in order from right to left, correct the items to its right by adding 1 to all those (currently) greater than or equal to x; finally interpret the resulting permutation of {0, 1, ‚Ä¶ } as sequence numbers (which amounts to adding 1 to each entry if a permutation of {1, 2, ‚Ä¶ n} is sought). Alternatively the entries of the Lehmer code can be processed from left to right, and interpreted as a number determining the next choice of an element as indicated above; this requires maintaining a list of available elements, from which each chosen element is removed. In the example this would mean choosing element 1 from {A,B,C,D,E,F,G} (which is B) then element 4 from {A,C,D,E,F,G} (which is F), then element 0 from {A,C,D,E,G} (giving A) and so on, reconstructing the sequence B,F,A,G,D,E,C. Applications to combinatorics and probabilities  Independence of relative ranks  The Lehmer code defines a bijection from the symmetric group Sn to the Cartesian product [n]\\\\times[n-1]\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times[2]\\\\times[1], where [k] designates the k-element set \\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots,k-1\\\\\\\\}. As a consequence, under the uniform distribution on Sn, the component L(œÉ)i defines a uniformly distributed random variable on , and these random variables are mutually independent, because they are projections on different factors of a Cartesian product.  Number of right-to-left minima and maxima  Definition : In a sequence u(uk)1‚â§k‚â§n, there is right-to-left minimum (resp. maximum) at rank k if uk is strictly smaller (resp. strictly bigger) than each element ui with i>k, i.e., to its right. Let B(k) (resp. H(k)) be the event \\"there is right-to-left minimum (resp. maximum) at rank k\\", i.e. B(k) is the set of the permutations \\\\scriptstyle\\\\ \\\\mathfrak{S}_n which exhibit a right-to-left minimum (resp. maximum) at rank k. We clearly have \\\\\\\\{\\\\omega\\\\in B(k)\\\\\\\\}\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\\\\\{L(k,\\\\omega)=0\\\\\\\\}\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega\\\\in H(k)\\\\\\\\}\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\\\\\{L(k,\\\\omega)=k-1\\\\\\\\}. Thus the number Nb(œâ) (resp. Nh(œâ)) of right-to-left minimum (resp. maximum) for the permutation œâ can be written as a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables each with a respective parameter of 1/k : N_b(\\\\omega)=\\\\sum_{1\\\\le k\\\\le n}\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1_{B(k)}\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad N_b(\\\\omega)=\\\\sum_{1\\\\le k\\\\le n}\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1_{H(k)}. Indeed, as L(k) follows the uniform law on \\\\scriptstyle\\\\ [\\\\\\\\![1,k]\\\\\\\\!], \\\\mathbb{P}(B(k))=\\\\mathbb{P}(L(k)=0)=\\\\mathbb{P}(H(k))=\\\\mathbb{P}(L(k)=k-1)=\\\\tfrac1k. The generating function for the Bernoulli random variable 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!1_{B(k)} is G_k(s)=\\\\frac{k-1+s}k, therefore the generating function of Nb is G(s)=\\\\prod_{k=1}^nG_k(s)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{s^{\\\\overline{n}}}{n!} (using the rising factorial notation), which allows us to recover the product formula for the generating function of the Stirling numbers of the first kind (unsigned). The secretary problem This is an optimal stop problem, a classic in decision theory, statistics and applied probabilities, where a random permutation is gradually revealed through the first elements of its Lehmer code, and where the goal is to stop exactly at the element k such as œÉ(k)=n, whereas the only available information (the k first values of the Lehmer code) is not sufficient to compute œÉ(k). In less mathematical words : a series of n applicants are interviewed one after the other. The interviewer must hire the best applicant, but must make his decision (‚ÄúHire‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot hire‚Äù) on the spot, without interviewing the next applicant (and a fortiori without interviewing all applicants). The interviewer thus knows the rank of the kth applicant, therefore, at the moment of making his kth decision, the interviewer knows only the k first elements of the Lehmer code whereas he would need to know all of them to make a well informed decision. To determine the optimal strategies (i.e. the strategy maximizing the probability of a win), the statistical properties of the Lehmer code are crucial. Allegedly, Johannes Kepler clearly exposed this secretary problem to a friend of his at a time when he was trying to make up his mind and choose one out eleven prospective brides as his second wife. His first marriage had been an unhappy one, having been arranged without himself being consulted, and he was thus very concerned that he could reach the right decision.http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/210F10/References/Secretary.pdf Similar concepts Two similar vectors are in use.

History The cemetery was opened in 1879 by the Lye and Wollescote Burial Board and was taken over by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council in 1933, however its chapels have been closed for many years. Chapels The Lye and Wollescote Cemetery Chapels building in the centre of the cemetery (originally called the Mortuary Chapels) was built in 1879 and is a Grade II listed building. It had two chapels, at opposite ends of the building; the nonconformist chapel was closed in the 1970s and the Church of England chapel closed following a fire in 1993. The West Midlands Historic Buildings Trust received a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to take full ownership of the building in March 2014. The trust planned to conserve the chapels and to bring them back into use as a venue for civil ceremonies. This project also aimed to create resources to encourage people to discover more about their local heritage and nature conservation, in particular via a resource-pack for schools and a nature trail. The refurbishment was completed in early 2016, the building is now in use as a secular registration office and has been renamed as the Thomas Robinson Building. War Graves There are 25 Commonwealth service personnel buried in the cemetery in graves maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, 15 from World War I and 10 from World War II. As part of the restoration plan, an illustrated book telling the stories of the 29 soldiers connected with the cemetery (15 buried in Commonwealth War Graves and 14 others killed in action who are commemorated on family graves and memorials) has been produced.

Wilensky (March 3, 1923 ‚Äì October 30, 2011) was an American organizational sociologist, noted among other things for his pioneering work on organizational intelligence. He was Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the author of 13 books and 70 articles. He was born in New Rochelle, New York, in 1923 and died in Berkeley, California, in 2011.Political scientist Harold Wilensky dies at age 88  Education  Wilensky attended Antioch College during 1942 and again 1945-47, where he majored in economics and political science. His collegiate years were interrupted by a term of service in the United States Air Force. Wilensky had been working with many labor unions, and originally went to the University of Chicago to for a full-time job doing union leadership training. He ended up attending the University of Chicago for graduate school, completing a PhD in sociology in 1955. When he arrived at Chicago, the person he was replacing suggested he get a degree while he was at the University. He originally planned to continue to study economics. When he went to the economics department to inquire about continuing his education, Milton Friedman, a young assistant professor and graduate advisor, asked him what he'd being reading that would qualify him as an economist. When he responded with Max Weber, John Stuart Mill, Karl Mannheim, Karl Marx, Harold Laski, Thorstein Veblen, and Joseph Schumpeter, Friedman said \\"You're not an economist, you're a sociologist. You should go upstairs and see the sociologists.\\" His dissertation was titled: The Staff \\"expert\\": A Study of the Intelligence Function in American Trade Unions. Writing about the Bay of Pigs debacle in his classic work ‚ÄúOrganizational Intelligence‚Äù (1967), Wilensky wrote that ‚ÄúThe more secrecy, the smaller the intelligent audience, the less systematic the distribution and indexing of research, the greater the anonymity of authorship, and the more intolerant the attitude toward deviant views.‚Äù He also argued that organizational intelligence benefited from healthy argument and constructive rivalry.

The robot may move forwards, backwards and jump, and the aero fighter may travel anywhere on screen but has limited fuel in which to do so. A combination of the two must be used to avoid obstacles, as well as to destroy any on-screen enemies for extra points.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the elevation to the peerage of the sitting Conservative MP William Jackson. Jackson had held the seat since its creation for the general election of 1885, having previously been one of the MPs for the multi-member seat of Leeds.The Times, 5 April 1917 p3 Candidates It was reported that both the Conservative and Liberal parties in Leeds were unprepared for a by-election, suggesting that Jackson‚Äôs peerage had come as a surprise to the party organisations if not to Jackson himself.The Times, 27 June 1902 p3 Conservatives The Conservatives considered a number of possible candidates including Colonel Thomas Walter Harding, a Liberal Unionist who had contested West Leeds against Herbert Gladstone and was a former Lord Mayor of Leeds; F. Stanley Jackson, the son of the retiring MP and a Yorkshire County cricketer; and Reginald Wigram and Sir Arthur Lawson, who were both officers of the party in Leeds.The Times, 30 June 1902 p6 They eventually selected Lawson, a 58-year-old businessman who was President of the Leeds Conservative Association.The Times, 3 July 1902 p8 Liberals North Leeds Liberal Association, who decided they wanted a strong local candidate, adopted Rowland Barran as their candidate in early July 1902.The Times, 5 July 1902 p9 Other possible candidates mentioned in the press were G. J. Cockburn, chairman of the North Leeds Liberal Association and the Leeds School Board, and W. Beckworth, but there was no real contest. Barran was aged 44, and prominent in a firm of local clothing manufacturers and merchants. He was the son of Sir John Barran a former MP for Leeds and for the nearby seat of Otley. Rowland Barran was a member of Leeds City Council and a former member of the Leeds School Board.The Times House of Commons 1910, Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p41 Labour The Independent Labour Party in Leeds announced that they would definitely be standing a candidate in the by-election. They were considering Philip Snowden who later became a Labour MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer and two other local men as candidates, as well as T. B. Duncan, Secretary of the Shop Assistants Association.The Times, 1 July 1902 p5 The party was reportedly not particularly strong in the division, with few members and in need of financial support from party headquarters. Keir Hardie visited Leeds with other top Labour and Trade union officials in early July 1902 to discuss the by- election. However, lack of resources eventually forced Labour not to bring forward a candidate. They had another by-election to fight in Clitheroe in Lancashire which was a better prospect and at a meeting of the ILP in Leeds on 4 July, Hardie told members that the fight in North Leeds would have to wait for a future election. Ironically the Labour position in the Clitheroe seat was so strong that both the Liberal and Conservatives chose not to contest it and the Labour candidate David Shackleton was returned unopposed. Issues Education Education dominated the campaign. A number of historians have commented that the Liberal candidate fought the by-election exclusively or predominantly on the issue.Frank Owen, Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George His Life and Times; Hutchinson, 1954 p127; Alfred F Havighurst, Twentieth Century Britain, Harper & Row, 1966 p72; Don Cregier, Bounder from Wales, University of Missouri Press, 1976 p79 As a former member of Leeds School Board, Barran took a strong interest in education. There was a robust debate going on around the government‚Äôs plans for an Education Bill to replace school boards with local education authorities and Liberals were highly exercised by the proposals to bring church schools into the public system. Many Liberals were strongly nonconformist and the idea that Church of England and Roman Catholic schools should be funded from the rates, a form of local taxation, was anathema to them. It provided the battle slogan ‚ÄòRome on the Rates‚Äô and united the party against the government.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p14 Barran, a Baptist by religion,Neal Blewett, The Peers, The Parties and the General Elections of 1910; University of Toronto Press, 1971 p27 spoke out strongly against these plans at his first public meeting on 8 July 1902, saying the proposed Bill was biased towards the Anglican Church and what he described as ‚Äòthe clerical party‚Äô. The Bill was designed to endow the clerical party, to hand over management of schools to the churches rather than the people through elected school boards and was, he claimed, a deliberate attack on the Free Churches.The Times, 9 July 1902 p11 Barran also held three further meetings specifically featuring the Education Bill issue.The Times, 21 July 1902 p7 It was reported that Roman Catholics in the constituency put their support behind the Conservative candidate Sir Arthur Lawson.The Times, 30 July 1902 p10 Other issues Other topical questions raised by the candidates included Irish Home Rule and Free Trade versus Tariff Reform. Temperance was also an issue supported by Barran while Lawson had the support of the electoral committee of the Amalgamated Licensing Trades. From the Liberal side there was an attack on the government for its inaction on social and economic questions,The Times, 25 July 1902 p5 presumably against the background of the increasing importance being given to these issues by the emerging New Liberalism. The Conservatives seem to have spent the election in defence of the government but clearly took the attack to the Liberals on supposed internal dissensions in the Liberal Party, around the roles of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Lord Rosebery.The Times, 26 July 1902 p12 Rosebery the former prime minister had become increasingly out of step with the mainstream of Liberal MPs on social reform and the role of the Empire. There were rival camps inside the party with the setting up of the Liberal Imperial Council in 1901 and the Liberal League in 1902. There were fears that this would formally split the party along the lines of the defection in 1886 of the Liberal Unionists with speculation that the Liberal League was a putative breakaway movement rather than simply a faction within the party arguing for a particular approach to government.Iain Sharpe, The Liberal Imperialists in Brack & Randall (eds.) Dictionary of Liberal Thought; Politico‚Äôs, 2007 p215 The issue was heightened because of the Boer War but the Liberal approach during the by-election was to praise the troops and the generals while attacking the government for underestimating the numbers of troops needed and for resisting necessary reforms to the Army. Result The result was a Liberal gain from the government, with Barran turning a Tory majority of 2,517 at the 1900 general election into a Liberal majority of 758. Rowland Barran There was a great upsurge of hope among Liberals that the result would send a message to the government on their plans for education reform but these were not maintained and the Bill passed later that year. The result also indicated a change in the demography of the North Leeds area which the education issue highlighted. Dissenting churches and opinion were gaining prominence. One historian of Leeds has written that while dissent was always strong in the city, it was becoming more confident and less deferential as the middle class element in the chapels grew with the economy.Derek Fraser, A History of Modern Leeds; Manchester University Press, 1980 p341 Barran went on to hold the seat until the 1918 general election when he stood down from Parliament.

It was entered into the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. The first segment, titled Antoine and Colette is by Fran√ßois Truffaut (France) and returns actor Jean-Pierre L√©aud to the role of Antoine Doinel, a role he played three years earlier in The 400 Blows and would return to again in 1968 (Stolen Kisses), 1970 (Bed and Board) and 1979 (Love on the Run). It concerns the frustrations of love for the now 17-year-old Doinel and the unresponsive girl he adores. The second segment, the directorial debut of 21-year-old Renzo Rossellini (Italy), son of Roberto Rossellini and later a noted producer himself, tells the story of a tough mistress who loses her lover to an older, wealthier and more-appreciative woman. The third, by Japanese film director Shintar≈ç Ishihara is described as a \\"weird, grotesque\\" and \\"clumsy\\" tale of obsessive and morbid love. Fourth is Marcel Oph√ºls (Germany) with a \\"charming, but somewhat sentimental\\" story of an unwed mother who contrives to trap the father of her baby.

It is unknown whether or not she was ever physically involved with the monarch. She was the daughter of Marshal Baron Charles De Geer and Catharina Charlotta Ribbing and married Lieutenant Anders Rudolf du Rietz in 1765. She is described as a well-educated and cultivated intellectual, with an interest in chemistry. In February 1768, it was noted that Charlotte Du Rietz and Eva Helena L√∂wen flirted with Crown Prince Gustav and attempted to seduce him. Eventually, he succumbed to the advances of the former. From July to September 1768, Charlotte and Crown Prince Gustav were involved in a strong emotional friendship. This has been referred to as the only love affair Gustav III ever had. The relationship mostly took place by a correspondence of love letters during the summer of 1768. At the same time, Gustav was under pressure to consummate his marriage to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark at his summer residence Ekolsund Castle, and he was blamed for his flirtation by Charlotta Sparre. In September, Gustav made an official inspection-journey through Bergslagen and visited L√∂vstad Castle, the childhood home of Du Rietz, where he ended their flirtation after he heard rumors that she had more lovers. He wrote his farewell letter in October, when he met her in Uppsala. The real nature of the relationship has been debated, with no specific conclusions of fact available. In October, there were false rumors that Sophia Magdalena was pregnant, while in reality the marriage was still not consummated. After the relationship with Du Rietz ended, Gustav suggested a love affair to Eva Helena L√∂wen, but she refused with the motivation that his infatuation for her was surely but a whim of wounded self pride, and although she could love him, she could not come between him and her own future Queen. The statement about the consummation of the marriage of Gustav III made by Adolf Fredrik Munck describes the sexual history of Gustav III and thereby also the character of his relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz.Gunilla Roempke (1994). Gunilla Roempke. ed. Vristens makt ‚Äì dans√∂s i m√§tressernas tidevarv (The power of the ankle - dancer in the epoch of the royal mistresses) Stockholm: Stockholm Fischer & company. In his statement, Munck reports that Gustav had only one partner before Charlotte Du Rietz, \\"the wife of an English sea captain,\\" in Gothenburg in 1766, but neither in that case nor in the relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz was there apparently any other physical contact than touching \\"without effect\\".Gunilla Roempke (1994).

Vristens makt ‚Äì dans√∂s i m√§tressernas tidevarv (The power of the ankle - dancer in the epoch of the royal mistresses) Stockholm: Stockholm Fischer & company.

It investigates, monitors, and reports on human rights violations and defends people's rights regardless the identity, gender or color of the victim. EOHR faces any human rights violations made either by governmental or non-governmental parties. It is registered with the United Nations and works with other human rights groups. Overview The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) was founded in 1985 by Saad Eddin Ibrahim and Hani Shukrallah.Beinin, 2011, p. 91. It was the first human rights organization in the country and remains one of the most professional non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in Egypt. Its headquarters is in Cairo, and has regional branches with a national membership of approximately 2,300 active volunteers in 17 provincial branches located across the country. EOHR is a non-profit NGO working within the framework of the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments regardless of the identity or affiliation of the victim or violator . EOHR acts and reports on both governmental and non-governmental human rights violations. According to its reports issues annually the decade of the late 1980s through to the late 1990s was marked by an increase in torture in Egypt. During this period the organization's activists were regularly harassed and arrested making their work increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges the organization maintained a steady accounting of state and non-state violations of human rights and started a series of publications of human rights books to raise awareness of human rights issues in the country. An attempt to start a theater company to tour villages with plays improvised on human rights topics was scrapped after the organizer was arrested by state security forces.Karim Alrawi, see section heading \\"Arrest and Detention\\" During the last decade of the Mubarak dictatorship the EOHR was represented, while maintaining its independence, on the state sponsored Supreme Council of Human Rights. EOHR's international status EOHR is part of the wider international and Arab human rights movement. It cooperates with the United Nations human rights bodies, as well as with other international and regional human rights organizations. EOHR was registered at the Ministry of Social Affairs in 2003 under registration No. 5220/2003. EOHR was granted special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 2006. This consultative status enables EOHR to enjoy closer interaction with the United Nations by participating in the activities of the International Council for Human Rights, according to ECOSOC decision 31/1996. This decision aimed to reinforce the principles of the human rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration and all other international human rights documents. EOHR is also a member of five international organizations: the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR), the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), International Federation for Human Rights (IFHR), the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX). Goals # To provide full respect for human rights and the basic freedoms of all Egyptians and non- Egyptians who are in Egypt, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. These include, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. EOHR defends the human rights of all individuals and groups against all forms of violation. # To reform the Egyptian constitution and legislation to bring them into accordance with international human rights covenants and conventions. # To promote the rule of law and full respect for an independent judiciary. # To guarantee the right to participation in public affairs without discrimination due to opinion, religion, gender, race or color. # To guarantee freedom of opinion and expression, in addition to artistic and literary invention. # To guarantee freedom of belief, thought and religion. # To ensure a fair trial for all defendants before a competent judge regardless of the kind of charge.

In addition, to assist prisoners and detainees who are subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. # To ensure that prison regulations and the treatment of prisoners are in conformity with the international Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Working methods EOHR adopts peaceful methods to promote and defend human rights. It believes that the promotion of human rights is a common goal for the entire world community and it is determined to spare no peaceful effort in its struggle against human rights violations. His main actions are: # Monitoring, observing and documenting the human rights violation and informing the official bodies about the violation incidents. # Issuing press releases on the human rights violations. # Providing legal support for the human rights' violation victims. # Holding open discussions on the Egyptian laws in order to comply with the international covenants of human rights. # Launching specific and specialized campaigns for raising awareness of the human rights issues. # Providing training for media and legal specialists on the human rights principles. # Holding training workshops for EOHR members and others for raising awareness of human rights. # Preparing researches on the human rights issues. # Holding an annual meeting for discussing human rights' issues. The EOHR accomplishes this by fact-finding missions. These include visits to prisons in order to collect testimonies, and to obtain document information about human rights violations. It also Issues urgent appeals, press releases, reports and publications on human rights violations. Furthermore, the EOHR tries to raise awareness on human rights issues among individuals and groups through publications, conferences, seminars and studies. In addition, this organization contacts Egyptian governmental and non-governmental bodies as well as international, regional and national organizations to seek co- operation, obtain information and take action to increase respect for human rights. Through the use of these methods the EOHR has adopted a peaceful method to promote and defend human rights in Egypt. Organizational structure The General Assembly of fee-paying members holds supreme authority in EOHR. A General Assembly meeting is convened once every other year to review and evaluate the organization's progress and to elect the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is the policy-making body within the EOHR and is led by the Chairman. It is made up of fifteen elected members, and up to four other prominent figures in the field of human rights can be invited by the Board of Trustees to join. The Executive Board is elected by the Board of Trustees and consists of the Secretary-General, the Treasurer and representatives of the main committees of the organization. The Executive Board, led by the Secretary-General, is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the EOHR and for any decisions made in the interim period between meetings of the Board of Trustees. EOHR has five substantive and inter-linked units, two projects and three auxiliary units: ;The Field Work Unit The unit includes a number of lawyers who receive complaints on the human rights violations and do the required investigations in order to make sure that the complaint is serious. They receive individual allegations of human rights violations and investigate each case's merits. Much of their work takes place in the field, on the ground, in prisons, in court, in detention centers, in homes, anywhere information can be found. The investigating lawyer writes an official report on each case. Then, depending on the nature and the merits of the case, the case may be removed from consideration or investigated further. Appeals and requests for information may be made to competent authorities and complainants may receive free legal counsel so that they can pursue a formal suit. All services made available to victims of human rights violations are absolutely free of charge. The unit does also the following: * Conducting fact finding committees for capturing information and documentation of human rights' violations. * Addressing the concerned official bodies and submitting complaints to the Prosecutor General, the Minister of Interior, the Manager of the Prisons' Authority, the Security Directorates' managers, Governors, ministries and embassies. ;The Legal Support Unit The unit includes a number of lawyers located at the headquarters of EOHR and others in the governorates to do the following: * Attending investigations before the prosecutor general concerning the human rights' violation issues. * Representing the human rights' violation victims in court. * Filing lawsuits before the State Council to cancel the decisions that do not comply with the international covenants. ;The Research and Publishing Unit This unit conducts academic research on human rights issues, analyzes the raw material of human rights abuses supplied by the Field Work Unit and the WLAP.

Born in Binscarth, Manitoba, Richard was the first of the six children Ellen Boulton and her husband Angus Bonnycastle, a lawyer and provincial politician. He was educated at University of Trinity College in Toronto, Ontario and at England's Oxford University where he toured Europe as a member of the university's ice hockey team which included a future Prime Minister of Canada, Lester Pearson, and a future Governor General of Canada, Roland Michener. In 1925, Richard Bonnycastle went to work for the Hudson's Bay Company. Between 1926 and 1937 he worked as a junior accountant before winding up as district manager for its western Arctic operations. In 1984, his diaries of the years he spent in the north were edited and compiled by journalist and author Heather Robertson and published as A Gentleman Adventurer: The Arctic Diaries of R.H.G. Bonnycastle. In 1931, Richard Bonnycastle married Mary Northwood. The couple had three children. Harlequin Enterprises In 1945 Bonnycastle went to work for Advocate Printers in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Harlequin was founded in 1949 as a partnership between Advocate Printers, Doug Weld of Bryant Press in Toronto, and Jack Palmer who was then head of the Canadian distributor for the Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies' Home Journal. Created as a publishing operation to reprint low-cost paperback novels, Harlequin initially focused on mystery fiction, westerns and cookbooks. In the early 1950s, Richard Bonnycastle obtained a twenty-five percent ownership in the struggling Harlequin operation and soon would acquire seventy-five percent of what was a business teetering on the edge of collapse. A twenty-five percent share of the company was given to key staff member, Ruth Palmour. Under the direction of Richard Bonnycastle the company's fortunes started to change. In 1953 Harlequin began to publish medical romances. When the company's chief editor died the following year, Bonnycastle's wife took over his responsibilities. Mary Bonnycastle enjoyed reading the romance novels of British publisher Mills & Boon and believed there was a market for their books in Canada and the United States. Her idea led to the most important decision in the company's history with the 1957 deal that saw Harlequin become the exclusive North American distributor for Mills & Boon romance novels. Community activity Aside from his successful publishing business, Richard Bonnycastle was active in his Winnipeg community. He served as President of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, was appointed the first chairman of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, and was named the first person to serve as Chancellor of the University of Winnipeg. On a national level, he joined the board of Ducks Unlimited Canada and would serve as its President, Chairman of the Board of Directors and as Chairman of the Executive Committee. Richard Bonnycastle died in 1968 as a result of a heart attack moments after docking his floatplane at a hunting lodge on Long Island Bay in the southern section of Lake Winnipegosis. His son, Richard Jr., assumed control of Harlequin Enterprises, building it into a major international publishing force.

Since 1994, the Consulate-General of Russia in New York City has been located there.   History  The purchase of land between 90th and 91st Streets fronting on Fifth Avenue by Andrew Carnegie, and the 1901 building of his mansion (which now houses the Cooper-Hewitt Museum), saw Carnegie purchasing neighbouring building lots in order to protect his investment. The entire north side of 91st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was purchased by Carnegie. Carnegie sold off lots to individuals who agreed to build substantial dwellings, and in 1903 a home was built at 9 East 91st Street by John H. Hammond, a New York City banker. The land, and possibly the house, was a wedding gift to Hammond and his wife, Emily Vanderbilt Sloane, from Sloane's father, William J. Sloane of W. & J. Sloane. The five-story Renaissance style limestone town house was designed by Carr√®re and Hastings, who were also responsible for the design of the New York Public Library, and is regarded as one of their finest residences. The design of the limestone-clad building, which unusually for a Manhattan town house offers a finished side elevation as well as its street front, is strongly influenced by 16th- and 18th-century Italian palazzo details. The ground floor has pronounced banded rustication, a motif which is taken through the three floors above in the pilaster-like quoining at each corner of the building. The first floor piano nobile is evident by its large casement windows proportionately taller than those below or above. On the principal facade these aedicular windows have segmental pediments supported on the flanking Ionic columns; they are given extra prominence by the small wrought iron balconies supported by limestone corbels. The windows of the second floor clearly denote it as containing secondary accommodation, while the windows of the third and top floor are smaller still, clearly indicating a lower status than those below. The upper floor contains masonry panels and is intended to complement the enriched entablature, frieze and boldly projecting cornice immediately above it. Interior photos from the early 20th century display a \\"rich series of Louis XVI-style rooms with elaborate marbles, carving, tapestries and furnishings.\\" The house had two elevators and a regulation size squash court on the fifth floor, which two generations of Hammond children found ideal for roller skating. The Hammonds lived in the house with their five children and 16 staff. Rachel Hammond Breck noted that her mother's parties never went for long, mainly due to her not serving alcohol. The reception rooms on the second floor - a by ballroom, library and music room - routinely sat three hundred guests, at concerts often featuring Emily Vanderbilt Sloane on piano, and John Hammond, Jr. playing violin or viola. Over the 44 years that the Hammonds lived in the house, many greats of jazz played in the house, including Benny Goodman, who would later marry one of the Hammond daughters, Alice. The Hammonds sold the house to noted eye surgeon Ramon Castroviejo in 1946, who slightly modified the interior of the building and began to operate an eye hospital on the top two floors. Under Castroviejo's ownership the house became noted for holding lavish parties for celebrities including British actress Hermione Gingold and Spanish Catalan operatic soprano Victoria de los √Ångeles. In 1974, over objections from Castroviejo, the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a landmark as part of the Carnegie Hill Historic District. The Government of the Soviet Union purchased the house from Castroviejo in August 1975 for US$1.6 million, and began renovation work on the building. The Soviets also spent US$400,000 on the neighbouring townhouse and US$100,000 for half a driveway which was owned by the neighbouring Convent of the Sacred Heart school. William Gleckman, who was responsible for renovations work on the building, noted that Mr. Myshkov, the Soviet Consul-designate, admired the building as it reminded him of imperial architecture in Russia. Gleckman installed new electrical wiring, a theatre and air-conditioning. The Soviets also received permission to install a large wrought-iron gate around the mansion and closed-circuit cameras to watch over the street in front of the building. A total of US$500,000 was spent on renovations before the Soviets were ordered to leave in 1980. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation returned to New York City in 1992 to find the building in an advanced state of disrepair. In co-operation with Random House, the Russians, including 16 artisans from Moscow, went to work on renovating the building and fixing the many problems which existed; water had seeped from the roof, floorboards squeaked and the plumbing, furnace and elevators no longer worked. The consulate opened in 1994.

General view of the botany of the vicinity of Swan River is an 1831 scientific paper by Scottish botanist Robert Brown. It discusses the vegetation of the Swan River Colony (in what is now Western Australia), and comments on its affinities with other regions. It has been described as \\"an essential step taken in our knowledge of the boundaries of the SW province\\". Background Brown's paper was based on information derived from three plant collections: the collection of botanist Charles Fraser, made during an 1827 expedition under James Stirling; a collection received by Brown from Alexander Macleay, Colonial Secretary of New South Wales; and a collection received by Brown from James Mangles. Brown had already made use of these and other collections in preparing his Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, published the previous year. In the course of his studies of Australian flora, he had prepared several manuscripts on the flora of the Swan River Colony: a list of plants of the Swan River Colony; a manuscript entitled Chloris Fluvii Cygni; and another entitled Proteaceae in occident.-meridionale... King George's Sound and Middle Island... Swan River... Baie de Geograph. During 1830, Brown helped established the Royal Geographical Society, sitting on the committee that drew up its constitution, and subsequently sitting on its inaugural council. He read his General view of the botany of the vicinity of Swan River at one of the first meetings of the society, on November 22, 1830, and it was printed the following year in the first volume of the society's Journal. In 1866 it was reprinted in John Joseph Bennett's The miscellaneous botanical works of Robert Brown. Content The paper begins by briefly describing the vegetation of the Swan River Colony, noting its richness in Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae (especially Acacia), Epacridaceae, Goodeniaceae and Asteraceae. Brown then notes the more prominent plants not in these families, in the course of which he transfers from Loranthus the well-known and unusual parasitic tree Nuytsia floribunda (West Australian Christmas Tree). Brown then considers the biogeographic affinities of the region, emphasising the close relationship between the Swan River Colony flora and that of King George Sound and Lucky Bay on the south coast. On the other hand, he found very few species in common with the east coast at similar latitudes. Focussing on Proteaceae, he reiterates the assertion first made in his 1814 General remarks, geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis, that the flora of the west coast of Australia has a strong South African element, whereas the flora of the east coast has a strong South American element. The paper closes with the observation that the noted dullness of Australian forests is due to the fact that the genera Eucalyptus and Acacia, both major components of the Australian vegetation, usually have stomata on both faces of their leaves, and thus lack a glossy upper face.

The youngest son of Brian Burke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and of the US Olympic hockey team, in November 2009, he made international headlines for coming out, advocating for tolerance and speaking out against homophobia in professional sports. Burke's coming out was widely praised and supported by sports news outlets and fans, generating multiple discussions about homophobia in sports, and in hockey in particular. He was viewed as a pioneer in advocacy against homophobia in hockey, described as \\"the closest person to the NHL ever to come out publicly and say that he is gay.\\" Burke was killed in a car crash on February 5, 2010. Following his death, Burke's memory and contribution to LGBT awareness in hockey was honoured by several hockey teams. The \\"Brendan Burke Internship\\" was later established in his honour by USA Hockey for his work in hockey management and a documentary entitled The Legacy of Brendan Burke aired on CBC Television in November 2010. Burke's death was the catalyst for the formation of the You Can Play project, a campaign to end homophobia in sports. Early life Brendan Gilmore Burke was born on December 8, 1988, in Vancouver, British Columbia,Olson, Lisa Brian Burke: A Father's Love Story Olympics Fanhouse, February 15, 2010 and was the younger son and third of four children of his father's first marriage. His parents divorced in 1995, and in 1997 he moved with his mother, Kerry to Boston, Massachusetts. During high school, Burke played hockey as a goaltender on the varsity team, but quit because he worried that his teammates would discover that he was gay. Instead, he told his family that he wanted to quit rather than spend the season on the bench. He graduated from Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood, Massachusetts. After high school, Burke could not decide between going to law school (after completing college), or a career in hockey management. He attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he was a brother in Sigma Phi Epsilon and came out as gay during his sophomore year. He interned on Capitol Hill in the summer of 2009 for U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt, and became a student manager at Miami University, responsible for recruiting correspondences, reviewing game film, working with coaches, and analyzing players. During this time, he attempted to decide between a career in politics or hockey management, eventually deciding on the latter. Coming out and advocacy Burke came out to his family during Christmas of 2007 and to his father, then-general manager of the Anaheim Ducks Brian Burke, after attending a Ducks game in Vancouver on December 10. Brian as well as the rest of Burke's family were accepting of his sexuality. However, Brendan's father and older brother Patrick, also a hockey manager, were concerned about how this might impact Brendan's career in hockey, noting homophobia in the hockey world in particular. As an advocate, Burke returned yearly to his high school to give talks on his experience coming to terms with his sexuality in a largely homophobic sports culture and the positive personal impact of his father's support. In November 2009, Burke came out to one of his teammates, Pat Cannone, after he was asked about his love life. He then came out to the rest of the Miami University hockey team, of which he was also the video coordinator and student manager, that he was gay. The story was leaked to ESPN.com. The Burkes appeared on the Canadian sports channel TSN, where Brendan Burke said he hoped his story would give other gay athletes and those working in professional sports the confidence to come forward. The team's coach, Enrico Blasi, and the rest of the team first learned of Burke's sexual orientation after the Frozen Four NCAA men's hockey championship in 2009. Burke was concerned that the news story on his sexual orientation might be distracting to the team, and approached Blasi, offering to walk away from the story if Blasi disapproved. With full veto power on the story, Blasi gave it his full support. His team was also accepting of his sexuality. Burke's public coming out was met with wide support from the press and fans, with the ESPN interview garnering praise from the hockey world. He received hundreds of emails and letters of support from gay athletes from across the continent. The news of his father's acceptance of his sexual orientation also earned Brian Burke praise from press and fans inside and outside the hockey world. The news further launched Brendan into advocacy, speaking about homophobia in hockey and encouraging discussion on the challenges faced by gay athletes in hockey and mainstream sports in general. In a later TSN interview, Burke stated that he hoped that telling his story would allow gay athletes and pro sports workers to know that there were supportive, safe environments for them and would encourage them to step forward as well. Toronto's Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) began using Burke's coming-out story as a teaching tool, stating that the story could \\"change so many families across Canada, particularly because so many young boys are expected to grow up playing with a hockey stick and make their dads happy.\\" His coming-out story gained further attention from a large variety of news outlets in the days that followed. Interest in Brendan's story was attributed to both his relation to his father and \\"hockey's sometimes homophobic culture.\\" Brendan Burke became well known in hockey circles following his public coming out. Blasi described Burke's presence as a \\"blessing,\\" creating awareness within the program about homophobia. TSN sportscaster James Cybulski commented that the reaction to Burke's story, and that it was a major story in the first place, demonstrated the need for Burke and his whole family to stand tall as a major step forward for all minorities. GlobeSports.com's podcast Hockey Roundtable featured a discussion between sports writers Eric Duhatschek and James Mirtle about the dialogue concerning openly gay athletes and high-profile employees in major hockey franchises that resulted from Burke's interview about his struggles with hiding his sexuality and eventual coming out. Duhatschek commented that NHL players were reluctant to discuss the recent news and the subject in general, attributing it to a culture of machismo in professional sports. Assistant coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, David King, stated that he felt that like athletic sports' role in breaking down the racial barrier, sports would do the same for gay athletes, albeit stressing that he felt it \\"would take some time.\\" Mirtle agreed, discussing the challenges of prejudice that closeted and out hockey athletes may face and highlighting NBA star John Amaechi's 2007 coming out as an example of strong anti-gay attitudes in the NBA and larger sports world. Death and legacy On February 5, 2011, the one-year anniversary of Burke's death, Brian Burke and his family are presented with special hockey sweaters in commemoration of Brendan Burke, which the RedHawks wore during their game that evening. Burke died February 5, 2010, at the age of 21 in an automobile accident. While he was driving in heavy snow near Economy, Indiana, his 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee slid sideways into the path of an oncoming 1997 Ford F-150 truck, killing him and his friend, Mark Reedy, a Michigan State University athlete, who was in the passenger seat. The impact of the collision fractured the base of Burke's skull, killing him instantly. The vehicle was mangled to such an extent that police officers and paramedics could not tell that Reedy was inside the vehicle, dead as well. A moment of silence was observed prior to the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Ottawa Senators game on February 6, 2010. Another moment of silence was also observed prior to the Miami University hockey game vs. Lake Superior State on February 6, 2010. The team also named him honorary first star of the game. The St. Louis Blues also held a moment of silence for Brendan Burke prior to their game against the Chicago Blackhawks on February 21, 2010. The funeral was held at St. John the Evangelist Catholic church in Canton, Massachusetts, where his family lives, with nearly 1,000 people, including the full roster of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Miami University Hockey Redhawks, in attendance. In April 2010, USA Hockey established the \\"Brendan Burke Internship\\" in honor of his work in hockey, describing it as being given annually to a recent college graduate seeking to pursue a career in hockey operations. The senior class of 2010 at Brendan's high school alma mater coordinated a fundraising campaign to donate a statue to be displayed on the Xaverian Brothers High School campus in memory of Brendan. On November 26, 2010, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television newsmagazine the fifth estate aired \\"The Legacy of Brendan Burke\\", a documentary detailing Burke's story and the discussion it generated about homophobia in hockey. During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the United States Men's Hockey Team wore dog tags inscribed with the words \\"In Memory of Brendan Burke\\". In June 2010, Chicago Blackhawks president John McDonough announced that he would be sending the team's recently won Stanley Cup with defenseman Brent Sopel who would march in the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade. Sopel began his NHL career with Vancouver and became friends with Brian Burke when he was the general manager there. Although he was traded to Atlanta earlier in the week, Sopel honored Brendan Burke by using his day with the Stanley Cup to display it in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade, stating to the press that honoring Burke's legacy and his father's example of familial support and tolerance was one of his reasons for marching in the parade. In recognition of the one-year anniversary of Burke's death, the Blackhawks wore special sweaters during their weekend game on February 5, 2011. In the wake of Brendan's death, James Mirtle wrote in an article in The Globe and Mail published after Burke's death that he \\"was widely hailed as a pioneer in a sport that has never had an openly out athlete.\\" He was also described as \\"the closest person to the NHL ever to come out publicly and say that he is gay.\\" Assistant coach of the RedHawks Nick Petraglia attested to the commonplace use of gay slurs in hockey culture and stated that Burke's coming out impacted their program in addressing homophobia. The New England Hockey Journal also wrote that Burke would be remembered as a pioneer for addressing the issue of homophobia in hockey. Andrew Sobotka, president of the Chicago Gay Hockey Association, attributed a doubling in the organization's membership to Burke's legacy and the Cup's appearance at the 2010 Gay Pride parade, describing the continued debate about gays in hockey as \\"everyone carrying his [Brendan Burke's] torch.\\" Burke's older brother Patrick Burke announced in a column on Outsports.com that the Burke family promised their \\"unwavering, unremitting, relentless support\\" for the cause of equality in sports and to continue working to end homophobia in hockey. Since Brendan's death, his father has continued advocating against homophobia in professional sports, giving speeches at schools, marching in the annual Toronto Pride Parade, and working with former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, whose son is also openly gay, through PFLAG. In March 2012, in tribute to Brendan, Patrick and Brian Burke founded the You Can Play campaign to fight homophobia in sports.

Towns were invited to send two delegates who were \\"the most sober, able and discrete persons\\" chosen by taxpayers at their respective Town meetings. History Nicoll opened the Convention by reading the Duke's Patent and his own commission. He then announced laws similar to those in New England, with one critical difference. They were less severe \\"in matters of conscience and of Religion.\\" Blasphemy and witchcraft, for instance, were not included among the eleven capital crimes. Other provisions included equal taxation, trial by jury, establishment of land tenure with land being held from the Duke, and old patents were recalled and new ones required. Significant for future settlement, was that no land purchases from the Indians were to be made without consent. Every parish was required to build and maintain a church, and no minister was to officiate, who \\"had not received ordination from some Bishop or Minister\\" of the Anglican Church. Prayers for the English royal family were required and services were to be held on the historic days of Nov. 5th, January 30, and May 29. Other laws were enacted to guide the manners of the time and actions of daily life. These laws were met by some resistance for the conferees, who had hoped for freedom equal or greater than in the new England colonies. They desired all civil officers be chosen by the freemen, all military officers by the soldiers, and that no magistrate \\"should have any yearly maintenance.\\" One request that would gain strength nearly a century later was that no tax should be imposed only with the consent of deputies to the General Court. This might be considered an early expression of the concept, no taxation without representation. Some compromises were made, though for others Nicolls recommended if delegates wanted a greater share in government than his instructions allowed, they \\"must go to the King for it.\\"Early Long Island: a colonial study by Martha Bock√©e Flint, p. 302. The Judiciary was also formed at this meeting. The High Sheriff of Yorkshire was to yearly appoint a Deputy for each Riding. Two Justices holding office at the Governor's pleasure, were given to each town. The towns were allowed yearly, on the first day of April, to elect a constable and eight overseers (later reduced to four). Two of the overseers were chosen to \\"make a rate\\" for maintenance of the church and clergyman, and support of the poor. From the overseers the Constable selected jurors to attend the Courts of Sessions and Assize. The Court of Assize was the highest tribunal, subordinate only to the Governor and Duke. The Governor, his Council, and the Magistrates of several towns met yearly in New York. The court held jurisdiction in suits of over twenty pounds, and appellate to lesser amounts. At the close of the Convention, Governor Nicoll appointed William Wells of Southold as High Sheriff, Captain John Underhill as High Constable and Surveyor-General, and the following as Justices: Daniel Denton of Jamaica, John Hicks of Hempstead, Jonas Wood of Huntington, and James Hubbard of Gravesend. High Sheriffs of Yorkshire would continue to be appointed, until counties were organized in 1683. High Sheriffs that followed included William Wells (1665‚Äì69), Robert Coe (1669‚Äì72), John Manning (1672‚Äì75), Sylvester Salisbury (1675‚Äì76), Thomas Willet (1676-79), Richard Betts, (1679‚Äì81), and John Youngs (1681-1683).Early Long Island: a colonial study by Martha Bock√©e Flint, p. 303.

It is located in the historical neighbourhood of Casco Viejo, in the district of Ibaiondo. It connects the rapid transit network of Metro Bilbao with the commuter rail services of Euskotren Trena. It is the main hub of railway connection between the metropolitan underground network and the railway services to Eibar, Gernika, Bermeo and San Sebasti√°n as well as the Txorierri valley. In its current form, the station opened on 8 April 2017.  History  The original station, named Bilbao-Aduana, was opened on 1 July 1904 as the terminus station of the narrow-gauge Bilbao-Plencia railway, an expansion of the original Bilbao-Las Arenas line, which opened in 1887. The Bilbao-Aduana station replaced the older but less centric Bilbao-San Agust√≠n station. The station was located on the former location of a customs building for the city's portuary facilities, hence named Aduana (Spanish for customs office). Bilbao-Aduana was an open-air station fitted between a hillside and the street. The trains emerged from a tunnel, named Esperanza tunnel due to being close to the street with the same name, before reaching the station platforms. The station immediately after was Matico, an open-air station located in the neighbourhood of Matiko, and reached after traversing the Esperanza and Gas tunnels. The station was operated by the Company of the Railways from Bilbao to Las Arenas and Plencia until 1947, after which it was merged with other narrow-gauge lines across the Bilbao metropolitan area to form Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transport of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. During this time the station became the main hub for the urban railway transit within the city of Bilbao and its metropolitan area, serving the lines to Getxo and Plentzia, as well as being in close proximity to other important stations like Bilbao-Abando across the river and Bilbao-Calzadas, also part of the FTS network and with trains serving the Txorierri valley, just a few blocks away. During this time the name of the station was changed to Bilbao-San Nicol√°s and it also held the central offices for FTS. The name came from the neighbouring San Nicol√°s church. In 1977 the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. After the transfer, it was announced that parts of the Bilbao-Plencia line would be renewed and transformed into the first line of Metro Bilbao (specifically the section between Deusto and Plentzia), and thus management of the station facilities was transferred to CTB (Consortium for Biscayan Transport) in 1995. As part of the renovation plans, the original station was demolished and replaced with a more modern infrastructure that included a new underground station for Metro Bilbao and overground open-air platforms for the existing services between Deusto and Bilbao-San Nicol√°s, which remained separate from the Metro Bilbao network. In 1996 a new tunnel was constructed linking Bilbao- San Nicol√°s with the former station of Bilbao-Calzadas, thus connecting with the Txorierri line. The new line was established as Deusto-Lezama and resulted from the merging of the section of the Bilbao-Plencia railway that was not integrated into Metro Bilbao (from Deusto to Bilbao-San Nicol√°s) and the line between Bilbao-Calzadas and Lezama. The new line was operated by Euskotren. The station was then once again renamed from Bilbao-San Nicol√°s to Zazpikaleak (Basque for \\"seven streets\\", the historical name of the old city), while the underground station was named Casco Viejo and was operated by Metro Bilbao. In 2007 it was made public the project for the line 3 of Metro Bilbao which would link Etxebarri to Bilbao via the Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga district, ultimately connecting with the old town and the Matiko area. The project involved a new connection station in the Zazpikaleak station, as well as a renovation of the section between Zazpikaleak and the Zumalakarregi and Matiko stations that until then were part of the Deusto-Lezama line. In 2009 the Basque Government presented the project for the new railway connection with Bilbao Airport, which included a connection from Matiko to the Airport via Sondika. This meant the integration of the Deusto-Lezama line into two news lines, which would be operated by Euskotren Trena instead of Metro Bilbao S.A. as the other metro lines. The new line 3 would connect in Etxebarri with the general Euskotren Trena railway line to Bermeo and San Sebasti√°n, which would allow to divert trains to the new Zazpikaleak station, integrating the Euskotren services in a single station. The section between Deusto and Zazpikaleak was closed down to railway traffic on 15 May 2010 once construction for the new line began. In June 2015 the Zazpikaleak station was closed down to be demolished to build a new one in its place. The new station was opened on 8 April 2017 with the new name Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo.  Station layout  Station's main hall. The original station built in 1904 was an open-air station with two elevated side platforms located behind the station's building. On the ground floor there were located ticket offices and waiting rooms, as well as the access to the platforms. The rest of the building included offices for the railway administration as well as apartments for its workers. After the first renovation made in the 1990s, the renovated building included a main hall with separate access to the Euskotren platforms, which were located on their original situation elevated behind the station, and the Metro Bilbao platforms, which were underground and followed the same cavern-like architecture as those in the rest of the network, designed by Norman Foster. The current station has a large common hall with ticket and customer care offices, with tunnels connecting to the respective Euskotren Trena and Metro Bilbao platforms.

After 1996 it was part of the commuter-rail network operated by Euskotren from Deusto to Lezama, with services to Derio, Sondika and Zamudio. Since 2019 it serves as a stop for all commuter rail services offered by Euskotren Trena in Biscay.  Metro services  The station served as the southern terminus for Metro Bilbao's line 1 from its opening in 1995 until the opening of Bolueta station in 1997. Currently it serves as a connection hub between the three lines of the network.  Bus and tramway  The station is served by the following local Bilbobus services.

She studied at the Smolny Institute from 1764 to 1776, as one of its first students, and excelled in music. On her graduation in 1776, she was decorated as one of its five best students, and was made lady in waiting to the Empress Catherine the Great. The Empress was fond of her because of her good humor and temperament. She was married successively to the writer and nobleman Alexei Rzhevskii in 1777, as his second wife, and in 1805 to the translator Maskle. Her second marriage, to a man twenty years younger than her and of lower social status, was regarded a scandal. Mariya Svistunova was her eldest child and only daughter. Glafira Alymova was regarded as one of the best harpists of her time. She was awarded the order of St Catherine by Empress Catherine.  Sources  * –†–∂–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ì. –ò.

Requirements A person wishing to do the Hochbegabtenstudium must be of above average intellectual ability and must as a rule have completed at least 10th grade. However some exceptions from that rule are made for very young students of superior intellectual ability, who are in a lower grade. In most cases a student wishing to participate in the programme must be at least 16 years old, however again exceptions from this rule are made for students of superior intellectual ability some of whom are only 13 or 14 when they enter college.

The war is notable for the introduction of early modern warfare to the region. It is also notable in Thai history for the death in battle of Siamese Queen Suriyothai on her war elephant; the conflict is often referred to in Thailand as the War that Led to the Loss of Queen Suriyothai (). The casus belli have been stated as a Burmese attempt to expand their territory eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya as well as an attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured. The successful defense preserved Siamese independence for 15 years. Still, the war was not decisive. The next Burmese invasion in 1563 would force a Siamese surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a vassal state of Burma for the first time. Background Rise of Toungoo Dynasty The Shwemawdaw Paya in Pegu (modern day Bago, Myanmar), the city became Tabinshwehti's new capital. Burma in the 15th century was divided into four principal power centers: the Ava Kingdom in present-day central Burma, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the southern coast, the Mrauk-U Kingdom (Arakan) in the west, and various Shan States in the east and the north. Beginning in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate into even smaller kingdoms. By the early 15th century, Ava's former vassals‚ÄîMohnyin (and its allies Confederation of Shan States) in the north and the Prome Kingdom (Pyay) in the south‚Äîwere regularly raiding their former overlord's territory with increasing frequency and intensity.Harvey 1925: 100‚Äì109 During this period of tumult, Mingyi Nyo, then governor of Toungoo (Taungoo), a small region located at the southeastern corner of Ava Kingdom also declared independence in 1510, and largely stayed out of the internecine fighting in the following years. When Ava fell to the combined forces of the Confederation and Prome in 1527, many people fled to Toungoo, the only region in Upper Burma at peace.Fernquest 2005: 20‚Äì50Harvey 1925: 124‚Äì125 In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's stability continued to attract manpower from the surrounding regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not to wait until the larger kingdoms' attention turned to him. In 1534, Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung, then a couple of 18-year-olds, launched their first military campaign against Hanthawaddy. It was the first of a series of wars by Toungoo that would engulf western and central mainland Southeast Asia for the next 80 years. In 1538‚Äì1539, the upstart kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing).Harvey 1925: 153‚Äì158Htin Aung 1967: 106‚Äì112 Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common border in the upper-Tenasserim coast. For the next six years, Toungoo was busy fighting against Hanthawaddy's allies: Prome (1542), the Confederation (1542‚Äì1544), and Prome's ally Mrauk-U (1546‚Äì1547). On the eve of the Siamese war, in 1547, Toungoo controlled a Lower Burma region from Pagan (Bagan) in the north to Moulmein in the south. Crisis in Ayutthaya Ruins of the Royal Palace of Ayutthaya, in the Ayutthaya Historical Park, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. The stupas of the royal chapel (Wat Phra Si Sanphet) is in the background. King Chairacha of Ayutthaya was a scion of the Suphannaphum Dynasty, which took control of Siam from the Uthong Dynasty in 1409. He came to the throne in 1533 after usurping the crown of his five-year-old nephew, Phra Ratsadathirat, who had reigned for only four months.Wood 1924: 100 The boy's father was King Borommarachathirat IV, Chairacha's half-brother. The child-king was subsequently executed by his uncle.Wood 1924: 101 King Chairacha died in 1546 after reigning for thirteen years, leaving the throne to his eleven-year-old son, Prince Kaeofa, who was crowned King Yot Fa.Wood 1924: 108 As the new king had not come of age, the role of regent was assumed by his mother, Chairacha's chief consort Si Sudachan (, also spelled Sri Sudachan), who was a descendant of the Uthong royal house. Chairacha's half- brother and Uparaja, Prince Thianracha, was another contender for the regency. To avoid court intrigues and conflict with Si Sudachan, Prince Thianracha retreated to a monastery as a monk.Wood 1924: 108 It is said that even before the previous King's death, Si Sudachan was having an adulterous relationship with a paramour styled Khun Chinnarat, who was keeper of the Royal chapel or cloister (, Ho Phra Thep Bidon) within the Royal Palace of Ayutthaya. Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, a contemporary Portuguese explorer, recorded a rumour alleging that Si Sudachan had poisoned her husband in order to take control of the throne, and perhaps to restore the fallen House of Uthong to power. In support of these allegations, she had many prominent officials executed, including the aged and high-ranking Phraya Maha Sena (Minister of Defence), and replaced them with her favourites.Wood 1924: 109 It was also recorded that she was heavily pregnant and soon gave birth to a daughter; unable to conceal this secret, she mounted a coup, removed her son and put her paramour on the throne. He was crowned as King (or Khun) Worawongsathirat. It was said that the young King Yot Fa was either executed or poisoned by his mother.Wood 1924: 110 Worawongsathirat's reign was short. Within 42 days several nobles and government officials of Ayutthaya plotted to remove him from the throne. The conspirators were led by Khun Phiren Thorathep, a descendant on his father's side to the kings of Sukhothai and a relation on his mother's side to King Chairacha. The usurper was lured from the safety of the palace into the jungle with a promise of capturing a large elephant. As the usurper king, Si Sudachan and their infant daughter proceeded by royal barge, Khun Phiren Thorathep and his conspirators sprang an ambush, killing all three.Wood 1924: 111Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 14 Prince Thianracha was immediately invited to leave the Sangha and assume the throne as King Maha Chakkraphat.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 15 One of his first acts was to appoint Khun Phiren Thorathep as King of Sukhothai (but as a vassal to himself) with a capital at the great fortified town of Phitsanulok. The king then bestowed upon him the title Maha Thammaracha (a title used by the last four kings of Sukhothai), along with the hand of his daughter Princess Sawatdirat in marriage.Wood 1924: 112Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 13 Tenasserim (1547‚Äì1548) The war began in 1547.Harvey 1925: 158 The casus belli have been stated as an attempt by Toungoo Dynasty of Burma to expand its territory eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya as well as an attempt to stop Ayutthaya's incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. According to the Burmese chronicles, a Siamese force of 6,000 had occupied Tavoy (Dawei) in the Upper Tenasserim coast, which he considered his territory, by January 1547.Burmese chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238) say Tabinshwehti learned of the Siamese occupation of Tavoy before he agreed to a truce with King Min Bin of Mrauk-U on 31 January 1547 (9th waxing of Tabodwe 908 ME). As frontiers in the pre-modern period were less defined and often overlapped,Fernquest 2005: 286 the \\"occupation\\" may have been an attempt by Ayutthaya to reinforce the frontier town, which was claimed by Toungoo. At any rate, Tabinshwehti sent a sizable force of 12,000 (8,000 army, 4,000 navy) led by Saw Lagun Ein, viceroy of Martaban, to take over Tavoy c. October/November 1547.The invasion likely began in late October/early November 1547 although Burmese chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238‚Äì239) simply say the attack on Tavoy began in 909 ME (30 March 1547 to 28 March 1548). The attack probably did not take place in early 1547 since Tabinshwehti's troops evacuated southern Arakan only on 26 March 1547 (5th waxing of Late Tagu 908 ME). The troops would have arrived back only in mid-to-late April, leaving just about a month for a military campaign before the rainy season began in June. The invasion, like most wars by the Burmese kings, probably began toward the end of rainy season and after the end of Buddhist Lent, which ended on 13 October 1547 (New moon of Thadingyut 909 ME) that year. A joint land-naval attack on Tavoy drove out the Siamese forces led by the Lord of Kanchanaburi to lower Tenasserim.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238‚Äì239 Invasion of mainland Siam (1548‚Äì1549) western central Thailand, depicting the towns captured by King Tabinshwehti's army. The plan of the city of Ayutthaya is shown with all the surrounding canals depicted. Burmese battle plan Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, and planned an invasion of Siam itself. By October 1548, he had assembled another 12,000-strong force that also included about 400 Portuguese mercenaries led by Diogo Soares.Harvey 1925: 158‚Äì159 The invasion force would have been equipped with the conventional weapons of the day: swords, bow and arrows, and spears.Quaritch Wales 1952: 145 The more elite members would also carry matchlocks or muskets.Quaritch Wales 1952: 189 These early modern weapons having been introduced to the two kingdoms by the Portuguese a few decades earlier. Tabinshwehti took personal command and gathered his forces at Martaban (Mottama).Phayre 1967: 100 The invasion forces were organized into three main armies: the vanguard army led by Bayinnaung, the main army led by Tabinshwehti, and the rearguard army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza and Mingyi Swe, each with a strength of 4,000 troops. Their route of invasion was via the Three Pagodas Pass towards Kanchanaburi, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. Start of invasion On 14 October 1548 (13th waxing of Tazaungmon 910 ME), the three Burmese armies left Martaban to start the invasion. The armies marched along the Ataran River toward the Three Pagodas Pass, entered Siam along the Khwae Noi River to the town of Sai Yok, then overland towards the Khwae Yai River. From there they travelled by boat toward the town of Kanchanaburi.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 16 Tabinshwehti travelled in great state with a massive retinue of elephants and servants. Many of these elephants carried muskets and bronze cannon; these were kept close to the king. Royal elephants were rafted across rivers, while the ordinary war elephants marched upstream to a ford. The Burmese king was accompanied by his crown prince Bayinnaung, Bayinnaung's thirteen-year-old son Nanda, and many richly attired lords. Hundreds of workmen marched ahead of the king's retinue, to pitch a richly decorated wooden camp, painted and gilded for the King's use, only to pack it up and pitch it at a new location every day. The invasion initially met little resistance, as the Burmese forces were too large for the small guard posts around the border. Upon hearing of the Burmese invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 17 When Tabinshwehti and his army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, they found it completely deserted.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 18 About a month into the invasion, mid- November 1548,The Hmannan Yazawin chronicle (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 241) uses the term , , which can be translated as either \\"full moon\\" or \\"full month\\" (completion of a month), to describe when he began the march to Ayutthaya. If it was full moon, the date of departure from Kanchanaburi would be 15 November 1548 (Full moon of Natdaw 910 ME). If it was full month, it would be 13 November 1548 (13th waxing of Natdaw 910 ME). the King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru, and Chorakhe Sam Phan. The Burmese continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong as well as the villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closing in on Suphanburi. When the Burmese attacked the town, Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya river near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli plain. Battle of Ayutthaya At the outskirts Painting by Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs, depicting Queen Suriyothai (center) on her elephant putting herself between King Maha Chakkraphat (right) and the Viceroy of Prome (left). Maha Chakkraphat decided to leave the capital with his forces, to engage Tabinshwehti and test the Burmese strength. On this occasion, he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one of their young daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding together on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.Wood 1924: 113 A battle certainly ensued although there are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 241‚Äì242 According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat engaged in single elephant-combat. (The custom of the time was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear as to why the Siamese king would have accepted to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 19 The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter‚Äîboth mother and child met their deaths on the back of the same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck‚Äîas she fell dying her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.Burmese chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 181‚Äì192) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238‚Äì248) devote a detailed account of the invasion, down to the names of war elephants the high royalty rode on. Thado Dhamma Yaza rode the war elephant named Ye Htut Mingala (Hmannan Vol. 2 2033: 244). If he was victorious in combat against any enemy of significance, such a story with a favorable outcome would likely have been included in the chronicles. At any rate, the remaining Siamese forces retreated. Tabinshwehti readied his army for a siege of the Siamese capital. He made his camp north of the city, with his headquarters at Klum Dong, and had his commanders encamp in strategic places surrounding the city walls, Bayinnaung at Phaniat, the Viceroy at Ban Mai Makham, and the Governor of Bassein at the plain of Prachet. The Burmese would not, however, take the Siamese capital so easily.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 20 Siege Ayutthaya sat on an island surrounded by three rivers‚Äîthe Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River to the west and south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding‚Äîespecially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya‚Äîotherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannons that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannons mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money‚Äîa dare that was ignored. Maha Chakkraphat, being unable to repel the Burmese, sent a message to his son-in-law Maha Thammaracha at Phitsanulok, ordering his vassal to come to his aid by bringing an army southwards towards Ayutthaya and if possible to engage the enemy in battle. Thammaracha quickly mobilized his forces and with the help of the Governor of Sawankhalok, marched southward with a large army to attack the Burmese rear. Upon hearing of this and on the advice of Bayinnaung; Tabinshwehti decided to withdraw, abandoning the mission altogether. His decision was compounded by news from Burma that the Mons, who had never been entirely subjugated by the Taungoo dynasty, rebelled in the absence of the king. Other factors included the scarcity of supplies and sickness in his army, which was not prepared for a long siege. Just one month into the siege, the Burmese command decided to withdraw. Retreat The view from alt= Battle of Kamphaeng Phet The Burmese forces chose to retreat via the Mae Lamao pass (in modern-day Mae Sot, Tak). In retreat, they tried to plunder the ancient and wealthy town of Kamphaeng Phet but the town was too well fortified. With the help of more Portuguese mercenaries, the Governor repelled the Burmese with flaming projectiles that forced the Burmese to cease using their cannons and protect them with coverings of damp hides. Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an opportunity take advantage of their weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese territory. For three days, the Siamese chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them.Phayre 1967: 101Cocks 1919: 44 Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces on both sides of the road. The Siamese in their eagerness fell into the trap.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 21 The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.Cocks 1919: 45 Truce The capture of his heir and his son-in-law forced Maha Chakkraphat to negotiate with Tabinshwehti. The Siamese at once sent emissaries bearing gifts, offering a peaceful retreat in return for the two princes.Harvey 1925: 160 In exchange Maha Chakkraphat was forced to hand over to Tabinshwehti two prized male war elephants called Sri Mongkol () and Mongkol Thawip (). Once the elephants were handed over, the Burmese army retreated in peace. In addition to the two princes, Tabinshwehti also released many other prisoners he had captured during the campaign. According to the Burmese records, the Siamese king also agreed to provide an annual gift of 30 elephants, a token sum of money, and certain custom duties.Htin Aung 1967: 113 After the treaty, the Burmese king rested for eight days, and returned to Pegu. He arrived back at Pegu on 1 March 1549 (3rd waxing of Late Tagu 910 ME).Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 232 Aftermath Despite his failure to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed to pay an annual tribute.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 296 Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted a little over a year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the Siamese campaign on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554‚Äì1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye,Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 204 not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy,(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 338): Wednesday, Full moon of Waso 924 ME = 17 June 1562 in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later. Legacy The restored Phra Chedi Sri Suriyothai at Wat Suan Luang Sop Sawan, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. The war was the first of the many wars between Burma and Siam that would last well into the mid 19th-century. It was also the first time the city of Ayutthaya was actually attacked by a foreign enemy. Queen Suriyothai Memorial, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. The body of Queen Sri Suriyothai was placed at Suan Luang, the Royal Garden. Maha Chakkraphat ordered a grand cremation, and built a temple with a large stupa to house her remains. The temple, which still exists, is known as Wat Suan Luang Sop Sawan () and the stupa is called Chedi Phra Sri Suriyothai (). The temple and the stupa had been restored and rebuilt several times. Despite her stature among the Thais for her heroism, the historicity of her story and her existence has been the subject of debate. This is based on the fact that the queen is not mentioned in either the recorded or popular history of Myanmar.A Historical Divide Subhatra Bhumiprabhas. Retrieved 4 March 2010 All the facts pertaining to her life were taken from fragments of the Siamese royal chronicle the Annals of Ayutthaya and an account by Domingos Seixas, a Portuguese explorer.Suriyothai: The Sun and The Moon. Retrieved 4 March 2010 The war led to the strengthening of Ayutthaya's defences, such as stronger walls and forts. A census of all able-bodied men was taken, as well as a massive hunt for wild elephants for use in future wars. The size of the navy was also increased.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 22‚Äì24Wood 1924: 114 The Siamese success at repelling the Burmese would not be repeated. This first ever invasion gave the Burmese an important experience on fighting with Siamese. The next invasion would be conducted by Bayinnaung, a man accustomed to fighting against Siamese soldiers and familiar with marching through Siamese terrain.Damrong Rajanubhab 2001: 22 The unrest in Burma delayed that next invasion for fifteen years, until the War of 1563 or the War of the White Elephants. Media The war, beginning with the death of Chairacha, was dramatized in the 2001 Thai historical drama The Legend of Suriyothai, directed by Mom Chao Chatrichalerm Yukol.Jirattikorn The film portrays the events leading up to the war and the battles including the death of Queen Sri Suriyothai. The film cost an estimated 350 million baht, and is the highest budget Thai film . The film was released in the United States in 2003. The succession crisis Ayutthaya is portrayed in the 2005 English language Thai film The King Maker. The film ends prior to the Burmese invasion.

At present, its most well-known political offshoot, the Southern Transitional Council led by Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, is the de facto leadership across many provinces of the south. History 300px 1994 Yemen Civil War After the union between South Yemen and North Yemen on May 22, 1990, a civil war broke out in 1994. This came after leaders of the former independent southern state declared an end to the unity deal amidst an alleged power-grabbing usurp by their northern counterparts. The result was a swift defeat of the weakened southern forces and the expulsion of most of its leaders out of Yemen, including the former Secretary-General of the Yemeni Socialist Party and the Vice-President of unified Yemen, Ali Salim al-Beidh. After 1994 After the 1994 civil war, calls for southern independence were successfully put down and national unity was maintained. Grievances however remained high amongst many residents of the south. Accusations of corruption, nepotism, and electoral fraud were leveled against the new ruling party based in Sana'a, led by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, as well as a mishandling of the power-sharing arrangement agreed to by both parties in the 1990 unity deal. Many in the south also felt that their land, home to much of the country's oil reserves and wealth resources, was being exploited after the unity deal. Privately owned land was seized and distributed amongst people affiliated with the Sana'a government. Several hundred thousand militaries and civil employees from the south were forced into early retirement and compensated with pensions below the subsistence level. Although equally, low living standards were prevalent throughout the whole of Yemen, many in the south felt that they were being intentionally targeted and dismissed from important posts,Kambeck, Jens (2016). \\"Returning to Transitional Justice in Yemen\\". Bonn: Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient. and being replaced with northern officials affiliated with the new government. The city of Aden, the former capital city of South Yemen, also witnessed neglect both socially and economically, whilst new investments appeared to be focussed instead on northern Sana'a, the new capital. Beyond the economic grievances were also cultural and social ones too. Many in the south long believed their history was distinct from that of their northern neighbours. This became more evident after the 1990 unity. After 128 years of British rule, South Yemen was an independent state for 23 years. Despite the economic difficulty in its later years with the collapse of its main backer the Soviet Union, the socialist state prided itself on its free healthcare, education and welfare system. Many in Aden today speak foreign languages or have technical skills as a result of their state- sponsored education abroad enjoyed in the days of pre-unity South Yemen. Unlike the north, tribalism was looked upon with disdain and generally stamped out of everyday life in the south, which instead preferred the law and order of civil society passed onto them from British rule. Post-1994 unity saw a gradual return of tribalism into southern society. It is not uncommon for residents of the south to even refer to those from the north as being \\"mutikhalifeen\\" or backward. In May 2007, grieving pensioners who had not been paid for years began to organise small demonstrations demanding better rights and an end to the economic and political marginalization of the south. As the protests spread throughout Aden and grew more popular, so too did the demands of those protesting. Eventually, calls were being made once again for the secession of the south and the re-establishment of South Yemen as an independent state. The government's response to these peaceful protests was heavy-handed, labeling them as 'apostates of the state' and using live ammunition to disperse the crowds. This eventually gave birth to the Southern Movement, which grew to consist of a loose coalition of groups seeking a complete secession from the north. Their presence in the south was restricted, and their actions were limited to the organising of protests and marches across the south which were often met with deadly violence. To raise the former flag of South Yemen was considered a crime in Aden, although a common practice outside of the city where government control was limited. Yemen Civil War In 2015, the Southern Movement rose to prominence after entering into a loose alliance with the exiled President Hadi and proving to be a vital force in the pushback against Houthi forces from the southern city of Aden, receiving both financial and military assistance from members of the Gulf coalition as a result. Today, the Southern Movement through its political branch the Southern Transitional Council has a significant presence in all areas of the former southern territories. Flags of the former southern republic are flown from Aden to Hadramout, often alongside those of the Arab coalition as a gesture of gratitude for their ongoing support. 150px In January 2018, schisms became evident between the STC and Hadi government after clashes in the city of Aden following the dismissal of STC leader Aidarus al- Zoubaidi by the Hadi leadership. 2019 Aden Takeover  On 1 August 2019, the Houthi movement based in Sana‚Äôa launched an attack on a southern military ceremony in the city of Aden. A medium-range ballistic missile was used to kill dozens in the camp, including a well-known and senior commander of the southern movement known as Muneer al-Yafee or Abu al-Yamama. The attack triggered widespread anger in the south, with the Southern Transitional Council leveling blame at the Hadi-affiliated Islamist Islah party, accusing them of complicity in the attack. In response, a four-day battle took place between UAE-backed forces belonging to the southern movement and those loyal to the Saudi-backed Hadi government. This was the first major time a rift had been so visible between both partners of the Saudi coalition that had previously been united, at least ostensibly, in their opposition to the Houthi movement. Dozens were killed in the infighting, which came to an end with the southern forces taking control of all government buildings and military camps within the city including the symbolic presidential palace. In response, Saudi Arabia launched an air strike in the city as a warning to the southern forces. On 26 April 2020, after reaching a peace deal in November 2019, the Southern Transitional Council (STC) broke the terms of agreement and said that it would rule Aden and other southern regions. However, the move infuriated Saudi- backed Yemeni government, who warned of \\"dangerous and catastrophic consequences\\".

When Cavendish was appointed Viceroy of Ireland in 1737, Wilmot became the Viceroy's Deputy Resident Secretary in England. He was promoted to Resident Secretary in June 1740, serving twelve successive Viceroys until the year of his death in 1772. Wilmot acted as an intermediary for William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire in the complicated negotiations which led to Cavendish briefly serving as titular Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1756-57. He was rewarded in 1758, when Devonshire patronage helped him become Deputy Secretary, and subsequently Secretary, to the Lord Chamberlain of the Household.

The episode is centered on Sun-Hwa Kwon and Jin-Soo Kwon. In 2007, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is captured by Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) men (unknown to Widmore), leading the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) to declare war with Widmore. Meanwhile, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) suffers aphasia. In the \\"flash-sideways\\", Sun & Jin's relationship puts them into harm's way. Plot 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) At the airport, Jin- Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is released by security after the incident about his undeclared $25,000 is resolved. His watch is returned, but the money is not, as Jin needs to fill out the paperwork declaring its purpose. Having missed his appointment at the restaurant, he checks into a hotel with Sun-Hwa Paik (Yunjin Kim). In this flash-sideways timeline, Jin and Sun are not a married couple. Instead they have become secretly, romantically involved without the knowledge of Mr. Paik, Sun's father. The next day, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand), his associate Omar (Anthony Azizi), and translator Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) arrive at the hotel to collect the watch and the money. Since they lack the money, Sun offers to pay from a private account. Keamy sends her with Mikhail to get the money, but they learn that the account was closed by her father. Meanwhile, Jin is tied up in the storeroom at the restaurant. Keamy reveals that the $25,000 was his payment for killing Jin, as Sun's father found out about his relationship with Sun. After Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) shoots Keamy and his men (shown from his point of view in \\"Sundown\\"), he finds Jin tied up. He hands Jin a box cutter to free himself and leaves. When Mikhail returns with Sun, Jin holds him at gunpoint. Mikhail fights back, and in the ensuing struggle, Jin shoots him fatally in the eye. Sun is also hit by stray fire. As Jin picks Sun up to take her to the hospital, she reveals she is pregnant. 2007 (original timeline) On the beach, Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) is waiting for Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) to return, confident that he will know what to do despite his claim otherwise. Meanwhile, Sun, upset by her inability to find Jin, storms off to her garden. There, she is greeted by the Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn), who offers to take her to Jin. Unwilling to trust him, she runs for the beach, knocking herself out against a tree branch on the way. Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) finds her alone, and the head injury has left her unable to speak English, though still able to understand it. Richard returns with Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), having decided on a course of action. Knowing that the plane on the Hydra island is the only means for the Man in Black to escape, he intends to destroy it. Sun is vehemently opposed to the idea, having come to the island in order to retrieve Jin and take him home. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) convinces her that they will find Jin and use the plane to get everyone home. Meanwhile, the Man in Black reveals to Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) that he needs to gather all the remaining candidates, or else he will not be able to leave the island. Before leaving to retrieve Sun, the Man in Black speaks with Sayid Jarrah, who tells him that he is no longer able to experience any sort of emotion whatsoever. When the Man in Black leaves, the camp is attacked by the team hired by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). They tranquilize the entire group and take Jin to the Hydra island. Jin awakens inside Room 23 and Zoe (Sheila Kelley) shows him a grid map which the Dharma Initiative used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Knowing that Jin was once a member of Dharma, Zoe asks Jin for his help. However, Jin demands to see Widmore. The Man in Black, accompanied by Sayid, takes a boat to the Hydra island to confront Widmore. When Widmore denies having taken Jin, the Man in Black warns him that war has finally come to the island and returns to his camp. Sayid is left behind to spy on them. Widmore is angry about the fact that Zoe has taken Jin ahead of schedule and orders her to bring the \\"package\\" from the submarine. Widmore gives Sun's digital camera to Jin, which has photos of his daughter. He explains that he has come to the island to stop the Man in Black from escaping, claiming that everyone they know would \\"cease to exist\\" should that happen. Widmore then tells Jin that he needs to meet the \\"package\\", a person who they brought to the island. The episode ends with Sayid spying on Widmore's team in the water, and witnessing a drugged Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) being dragged out of the submarine.

The episode was aired on April 6, 2010, on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse and directed by Jack Bender. The episode is centered on Desmond Hume. In 2007, Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) undergoes Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) experiment and interacts with his \\"flash-sideways\\" counterpart where Desmond, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), and Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) experience visions of their actual-universe counterparts. \\"Happily Ever After\\" was watched by 9 million American viewers and received critical acclaim by critics and audiences alike, and is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of season six. Plot 2007 (original timeline) After being shot by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) in the episode \\"Dead Is Dead\\", Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) awakens to discover that Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) has brought him back to the Island. Desmond attacks Charles, who tells him the Island is not done with him, and that unless Desmond helps him, everyone he loves will be gone forever. He has his team prepare an electro-magnetic test, which kills a team member in the path of the toroids as they set up. Desmond is bound to a chair and locked in with the toroids as the test is run. After the test has finished, Desmond agrees to help Charles. As Charles' team lead him away, they are ambushed by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), who takes a willing Desmond away with him. 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) Desmond arrives in Los Angeles at the behest of his employer, Charles Widmore. After helping the heavily pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to get her luggage, Desmond goes to Charles' office. Charles informs Desmond that his son Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies), a classical musician, has invited the rock band Driveshaft to perform alongside him that evening. The band's bass guitarist, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), has been arrested for possessing drugs, and Charles requires Desmond to collect and deliver him to Daniel's event. Upon their meeting, Charlie tells Desmond that he recently almost died after swallowing a bag of heroin (As seen in \\"LA X\\"), and in his near-death state experienced an intense, blissful vision in which he was with a blonde woman. He causes Desmond to crash his car into a nearby marina, and while Desmond attempts to rescue Charlie from the water, he too experiences a vision, seeing Charlie drowning with the words \\"Not Penny's Boat\\" written on his palm. The two are taken to a hospital, where Desmond has a short series of visions of Penny (Sonya Walger), a stranger to him, during an MRI test. After discharging himself from the hospital, Desmond apologizes to Charles' wife Eloise Widmore (Fionnula Flanagan) for being unable to ensure the attendance of Driveshaft. Nearby employees are discussing the guest-list for Daniel's concert, and Desmond hears the name Penny mentioned. Eloise refuses to let him see the list, and warns him off of pursuing his inquiries. As Desmond prepares to leave, he is stopped by Daniel, who tells him that he recently saw a red-haired woman in a local museum that he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states that after the encounter, he made a series of notes in his journal which a mathematician friend has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes which contain a graph with imaginary time on one axis, and hypotheses that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path, and something massive, like a nuclear explosion, has altered their realities. Desmond questions Daniel as to whether he intends to set off a nuclear bomb, to which Daniel replies he believes he already has. Daniel tells Desmond that Penny is his half-sister, and tells him where he can find her. Desmond locates Penny running the steps of an athletics stadium, and introduces himself. After shaking Penny's hand, Desmond passes out. When he awakens, he asks Penny out for coffee, an invitation which she accepts. As his driver George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) takes him to their meeting point, Desmond asks him to acquire the flight manifest for Oceanic 815, the flight which brought him to Los Angeles. When Minkowski asks why he needs it, Desmond responds, \\"I just need to show them something\\". Reception \\"Happily Ever After\\" was met with critical acclaim.

It is one of two remaining locomotives of D&RGW; class K-27, the other one being No. 464 at the Huckleberry Railroad in Genesee Township, Michigan. The class eventually became known by the nickname \\"Mudhens\\". Today, No. 463 is operational on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad between Chama, New Mexico and Antonito, Colorado. Fifteen locomotives were built, originally class 125, then reclassified K-27 in 1924 when the D&RG; became the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. The K-27s were built as Vauclain compounds, with two cylinders on each side, expanding the steam once in the smaller cylinder and then a second time in the larger one. The extra maintenance costs of the two cylinders were greater than the fuel saving, so they were converted to simple expansion in 1907‚Äì1909. They were Rio Grande's last purchase of compound locomotives. They pulled freight, passenger and mixed trains on the D&RGW; in and over the Colorado Rocky Mountains, traversing the entire length of the railroad. They were built with their main structural frames outside the driving wheels, with the counterweights and rods attached outside the frames. No. 463 was sold to cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry in May 1955. Autry never used the engine and donated it to the town of Antonito, Colorado. It was restored by and entered into service on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad in 1994. It was taken out of service with a broken side rod in 2002. In 2009, it was moved to the railroad's shop at Chama, New Mexico where a major rebuild was taken until completion in Spring 2013. On May 20, 2013, the restored locomotive made its inaugural run on the C&TSRR.; No. 463 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Engine No. 463. Film Credits The D&RGW; engine No. 463 appeared in season 1, episode 38 of Gunsmoke on August 18, 1956 as Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway #463. The episode was entitled \\"Unmarked Grave\\". It also appeared at the beginning of an episode of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater which originally aired on December 7, 1956. Season 1, Episode 10 was titled \\"Return to Nowhere\\".

The 1501st Air Transport Wing was a heavy cargo transport wing of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), formed on 1 June 1948. The unit was originally designated as the 530th Air Transport Wing and assigned to the MATS Pacific Division. The wing was stationed at Travis Air Force Base, California. The 1501st was discontinued on 8 January 1966 as part of the replacement of MATS by Military Airlift Command. Its aircraft, personnel and equipment were transferred to the Military Airlift Command 60th Military Airlift Wing, which was activated at Travis the same day. History Douglas C-54 Skymaster Established on 1 June 1948 concurrent with the activation of the Military Air Transport Service; assumed responsibility for mission previously carried out by the Air Transport Command by transporting cargo and personnel to destinations within Far East Air Force and to the Continental United States. Also operated MATS West Coast's aerial embarkation and debarkation point. C-118 Liftmasters and C-121 Constellations were common sights in the 1950s, while C-135 Stratolifters and C-141 Starlifters were used in the 1960 for passenger transport, mostly to destinations in Southeast Asia or Japan. Many soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines returned to the United States from the Vietnam War via the Travis Aerial Port. C-97 Stratofreighter The 530th Air Transport Group was organized from a consolidation of the Air Transport Command (ATC) Eastern Pacific Wing and Naval Air Transport Squadrons. Its first commander was Brigadier General Harold Q. Huglin. It was initially equipped with four squadrons of C-54 Skymasters that could reach the Continental US, but required intermediate stopovers along the Pacific Transport Routes to stations as far as Pakistan. However, the demands of the Berlin Airlift for C-54s led to two of the group's squadrons being deployed to Germany in July 1948. Unit was redesignated as 1501st Air Transport Wing in October 1948 and assigned transport squadrons were also redesignated in a MATS reorganization. In May 1949, Fairfield-Suisun was realigned from MATS to Strategic Air Command jurisdiction, and all of the Wing's squadrons were reassigned to the 1500 ATW at Hickam AFB on 30 June. Wing was reduced to a group level and operated an Aeromedical Transport Squadron. In 1953, large- scale MATS operations were resumed when five C-97 Stratofreighter squadrons were activated. Returned to wing status in 1955. C-97 squadrons reduced to four in 1955 due to finding reductions. 75th & 85th ATS replaced C-97s with C-124 Globemaster IIs in 1957. 84th ATS re-equipped with C-133 Cargomasters in 1957. 47th ATS reassigned from Hickam in 1957 with C-97s. C-124 Globemaster II 22d Air Force arrived from Kelly AFB, TX, 25 June 1958 and the base's primary mission reverted to global airlift activities when MATS resumed jurisdiction. 1501 ATW was also reassigned to the Western Transport Air Force on 1 July 1958. Both 47th and 55th ATS inactivated in 1960, C-97s reassigned to reserves. 44th ATS activated in 1961 with jet C-135 Stratolifters. 86th ATW activated in 1963 with extended-range MATS C-130E Hercules. The 1501st ATW was inactivated on 8 January 1966 as part of the inactivation of MATS, its aircraft, personnel and equipment being assigned to the Military Airlift Command 60th Military Airlift Wing. Major airlifts * In 1956, MATS airlifted iron lungs and other medical equipment to Buenos Aires, Argentina, during a polio epidemic. * In 1960, shen the Ceara and Tiauim areas of Brazil were devastated by floods, MATS C-124's airlifted emergency equipment, medical supplies, and two helicopters to the scene. Also flew 77 mercy missions to Chile when earthquakes literally remade parts of that country. Homeless millions were aided by 877 tons of clothing, food, helicopters, and medical supplies, including two complete Army field hospitals. The longest airlift MATS had flown to that time, average flying time one way was 25 hours to cover 4,500 miles. * From 1957‚Äì1963, MATS C-124 Globemasters conducted six years of seasonal flying as members of the Air Force-Navy team resupplying scientific stations in the Antarctic. During that time the aircraft air-dropped about 4,000 tons of supplies from the main Antarctic base at McMurdo Sound to remote stations near and at the South Pole. Beginning in 1963, Lockheed C-130E Hercules, newer, faster, and longer range, picked up the MATS portion of the mission. The performance of the C-124's in the Antarctic cold strengthened the concept of airlift flexibility by doing in a few weeks (each year) a job that would have taken surface transportation several months. During Deep Freeze III, a C-124 air-dropped a seven-ton tractor to an isolated site, and during Deep Freeze 62 (October‚ÄìDecember 1961), three C-124's made the longest flight in Antarctic history, a 3,100-mile round trip to airdrop supplies. Also during Deep Freeze 62, Lt. Gen. Joe W. Kelly became the first MATS commander to visit the operation. MATS vice commander, Maj. Gen. Raymond J. Reeves, visited Deep Freeze 63. * In 1959, a MATS C-133 Cargomaster airlifted, for the first time, an Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile ‚Äì from Miramar Naval Air Station, San Diego, to ARDC's Ballistic Missile Division at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming. * In 1960, MATS almost doubled its aircraft flying rate during March in a test of its ability to surge to a wartime pace. As part of this exercise, it joined with the Army in the largest peacetime airlift exercise in military history (Big Slam Puerto Pine), airlifting 21,095 troops and 10,925 tons of their combat equipment from the U.S. to Puerto Rico and back.

He examined palimpsests' text of the Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis and deciphered text of Codex Carolinus. He was the author of many works.  Life  Romans 11:33-12:1 in Knittel's edition of Codex Carolinus In 1751 he became a priest, in 1753 Archdeacon of the main church in Wolfenb√ºttel.Heinrich D√∂ring, Franz Anton Knittel, in: Die deutschen Kanzelredner des achtzehnten und neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, p. 172 In 1766 he became general superintendent and the first preacher in Wolfenb√ºttel and in 1776 general superintendent in Brunswick.Heinrich D√∂ring, Franz Anton Knittel, in: Die deutschen Kanzelredner des achtzehnten und neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, p. 173 After receiving work in the main church of Wolfenb√ºttel Knittel started to examine manuscripts housed in the Ducal Library of Wolfenb√ºttel. In 1756 he studied the Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. The manuscript and its palimpsest text had earlier been examined by Heusinger, who described it in 1752,Jakob Friedrich Heusinger, De quattuor Evangeliorum Codice Graeco, quem antiqua manu membrana scriptum Guelferbytana bibliotheca servat, Guelf 1752. but Knittel was the first who recognized that the palimpsest Greek text belonged to two different manuscripts of the New Testament. Knittel designated these two texts by sigla A and B. He recognized also lists of the (chapters) as another, the third Greek manuscript. Knittel also deciphered and reconstructed the Gothic-Latin text of the palimpsest and published it in 1762 at Brunswick.Ulphilae versionem Gothicam nonnullorum capitum epistolae Pauli ad Romanos e litura MS. rescript Bibliothecae Guelferbytanae, cum variis monumentis ineditis eruit, commentatus est, detitque foras, Brunovici 1762 It is known as Codex Carolinus. The upper text of palimpsest contains text of Isidore of Seville's Origines and his six letters. Knittel designated it by siglum E and dated it to the 11th century. Knittel made many errors in deciphering the palimpsest's text, especially in the Latin text of Codex Carolinus (e.g. enarrabilia for scrutabilia). Tischendorf made a new and more accurate collation for the Latin text (edited in 1855).Constantin von Tischendorf, Anecdota sacra et profana (Lipsiae 1855), p. 155‚Äì158. A new collation of the Gothic text was published by Carla Falluomini in 1999.G. W. S. Friedrichsen, The Gotic Text of Rom. XIV, in Cod. Guelferbytanus, Weissenburg 64, JTS 1937, pp. 245-247 Knittel examined also other manuscripts (e.g. Minuscule 126, 429). Knittel defended a traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism. He defended an authenticity of the Pericopa Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11), Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7), and Testimonium Flavianum. According to him Erasmus in his Novum Instrumentum omne did not incorporate the Comma from Codex Montfortianus, because of grammar differences, but used Complutensian Polyglotta. According to him the Comma was known for Tertullian.Knittel, Neue Kritiken √ºber den ber√ºhmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins Braunschweig 1785  Works  * Gedanken von einem Lehrgebaude einer gemessenen Geistlerlehre und ihrem Bussen in der Gottesgelahrtheit 1746 * Epistola, in qua de eo, quod in Georgicis Hesiodes, quae ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±Œπ inscribuntur, supposititium est, disseruit de salis vallibus et a viro celebrrimo in arte critica M. horum, quae accusantus, vindice atquae assertore, dissentit, Brunsvick 1754 * Neue Gedanken von den allgemeinen Christsehlern in den Handschriften des Neuen Testamtns u. s. w., mebst einem Versuche einer hermeneutischen Muthmassunge - Sitten - Lehre der ersten Kirche, Braunschweig 1755 * Praecopium Ulphilanum primum, Brunovici 1758; alterum 1760 * Ulphilae versionem Gothicam nonnullorum capitum epistolae Pauli ad Romanos e litura MS. rescript Bibliothecae Guelferbytanae, cum variis monumentis ineditis eruit, commentatus est, detitque foras, Brunovici 1762 * Friedenspredigt, Braunschweig 1763 * Prisca ruris ecclesia, Brunovici 1767 * Beytr√§ge zur Kritik √ºber Johannes Offenbarung, Schr√∂der, Braunschweig und Hildensheim 1773. * Neue Kritiken √ºber das weltber√ºhmte Zeugnis dea alten Juden Flav.

Taking place on 1 December 1916, the battle was fought along the line of the Arge»ô River in Romania between Austro-German forces of the Central Powers and Romanian forces. Background In late November 1916 Germano-Bulgarian forces under August von Mackensen crossed the Danube near Zimnicea under the cover of fog and began to march on Bucharest.Stone 1998, p. 279.Burg & Purcell 2004, p. 145. The Romanians had transferred most of their forces to the Carpathians and as a result these forces had a preponderant advantage: 18 Romanian battalions and 48 artillery pieces against 40 German and Bulgarian battalions and 188 guns.Stone 1998, p. 280. This attack threatened to cut off half the Romanian army and so the decision was made to launch a counterattack. Relying upon the Russians to contain the fighting elsewhere, the plan entailed using all of the Romanian Army's reserves to launch a flanking attack on the German forces as they crossed the Arge»ô river, the last natural barrier before Bucharest. The Russians did not agree to this plan of action, but nevertheless plans for the attack went ahead. The French sent a military mission to Romania and its commander, Henri Mathias Berthelot, who had been Joffre's chief of staff during the Battle of the Marne in 1914 felt that the attack could bring a similar success. In this regard he advocated the buildup of a Romanian forces, drawing divisions from the Danube and the Carpathians. Battle On 1 December the Romanian attack began. Initially, the Romanians experienced success, taking a large number of prisoners,Baldwin 1962, p. 85. however, the failure of their reserves to arrive due to the actions of the Romanian General Sosescu, who was a naturalized German,Thompson, Bryce & Petrie 1920, p. 620. followed by the arrival of German reinforcements led to their weakening and eventual defeat. Mackensen was able to shift forces to deal with the sudden assault and Falkenhayn's forces responded with attacks at every point. Within three days, the attack had been shattered and the Romanians were retreating everywhere. Part of the Romanian Army was cut off from the city after German forces conducted a pincer movement north and south of the river.Willcox & Stuart 1917, p. 661. The Romanians suffered a considerable setback when a staff car carrying attack plans accidentally drove into a German position and was captured.Burg & Purcell 2004, p. 146. Before retreating, Romanian troops burned down the oil wells at Ploie»ôti along with the surrounding wheat fields so as to keep them out of the hands of the Central Powers. After Falkenhayen's Ninth Army cut off a portion of the Romanian Army, the remainder retreated to the Siret‚ÄìPutna defensive line, one of the outermost defensive lines of Bucharest. There they rendevouzed with the Bucharest garrison and prepared to hold the line.King 1922, p. 258. Aftermath Falkenhayn's cavalry entering Bucharest After the battle, minor actions were fought in the fortifications surrounding Bucharest between the invading Germans and the Romanian reserves which had failed to arrive and the remnants of the defenders of the Sereth‚ÄìPutna line, yet it was occupied by the Germans on 6 December 1916, which was the same day that southern Romania capitulated, as the monarchy had fled to Ia»ôi. Heavy rain and terrible roads were the only things that saved the remainder of the Romanian Army, which began to withdraw towards the Siret River and Russia, where the campaign drew to a close in January 1917. Romanian losses during the battle on the Arge»ô and the fighting that preceded it were very high, with about 300,000 being lost, around 150,000 of which were captured. In this same period, the Germans had suffered about 60,000 casualties. The German heritage of General , a subordinate of Constantin Prezan, has been the topic of several debates regarding the battle regarding the Romanian reserves.

It is a white crystalline or amorphous powder insoluble in water. Its toxicity is low. Its melting point is 980 ¬∞C. Variants Several variants of zinc borate exist, differing by the zinc/boron ratio and the water content: * Zinc borate Firebrake ZB (2ZnO¬∑3 B2O3¬∑3.5H2O), CAS number 138265-88-0 * Zinc borate Firebrake 500 (2ZnO¬∑3 B2O3), CAS number 12767-90-7 * Zinc borate Firebrake 415 (4ZnO¬∑B2O3¬∑H2O), CAS number 149749-62-2 * ZB-467 (4ZnO¬∑6B2O3¬∑7H2O), CAS number 1332-07-6 * ZB-223 (2ZnO¬∑2B2O3¬∑3H2O), CAS number 1332-07-6 The hydrated variants lose water between 290‚Äì415 ¬∞C. Uses Zinc borate is primarily used as a flame retardant in plastics and cellulose fibers, paper, rubbers and textiles. It is also used in paints, adhesives, and pigments. As a flame retardant, it can replace antimony(III) oxide as a synergist in both halogen- based and halogen-free systems. It is an anti-dripping and char-promoting agent, and suppresses the afterglow. In electrical insulator plastics it suppresses arcing and tracking. In halogen-containing systems, zinc borate is used together with antimony trioxide and alumina trihydrate. It catalyzes formation of char and creates a protective layer of glass. Zinc catalyzes the release of halogens by forming zinc halides and zinc oxyhalides. In halogen- free system, zinc borate can be used together with alumina trihydrate, magnesium hydroxide, red phosphorus, or ammonium polyphosphate. During burning the plastics, a porous borate ceramics is formed that protects the underlying layers. In presence of silica, borosilicate glass can be formed at plastic burning temperatures. Zinc borate is used in polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins, polyamides, epoxy resins, polyesters, thermoplastic elastomers, rubbers, etc. It is also used in some intumescent systems. Zinc borate has synergistic effect with zinc phosphate or barium borate as a corrosion inhibitor pigment. Zinc borate acts as a broad-spectrum fungicide in plastics and wood products. Zinc borate can be used as a flux in some ceramics. In electrical insulators it improves the ceramics properties. Nanopowder zinc borate can be used for the applications above, and also for improving the frictional properties of lubricating oils.

Language and culture. In R.W. Fasold and J. Connor Linton (eds.) An Introduction to Language and Linguistics, 343-372. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. It is one of the ways in which linguists look at the intersections of human language and human society; other subfields that take this perspective are language planning, minority language studies, quantitative sociolinguistics, and sociohistorical linguistics, among others. Interactional sociolinguistics is a theoretical and methodological framework within the discipline of linguistic anthropology, which combines the methodology of linguistics with the cultural consideration of anthropology in order to understand how the use of language informs social and cultural interaction. Interactional sociolinguistics was founded by linguistic anthropologist John J. Gumperz.Gumperz, John J. (1982). Discourse Strategies. Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Topics that might benefit from an Interactional sociolinguistic analysis include: cross-cultural miscommunication, politeness, and framing.  John J. Gumperz  John J. Gumperz was an integral figure in the solidification of anthropology as an academic discipline and in the creation of the interdisciplinary field of linguistic anthropology. Born in 1922 he was able to play a crucial role in setting up how future scholars looked at language, culture, and social meaning. Gumperz conducted ethnographic work around the world as well as teaching at many esteemed universities in the United States. He worked with several great thinkers across disciplines (including: psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology) in order to establish his framework around Interactional sociolinguistics.  In Practice  In terms of research methods, interactional sociolinguists analyzes audio or video recordings of conversations or other interactions. Concerning the methodology of discourse analysis, by which instances of interactional sociolinguistics can be isolated, there are many ways in which language can be analyzed. Though Gumperz pioneered his framework several decades ago it is still being used by anthropologists today in their research. Oftentimes researchers will focus on specific linguistic components. Some focus on specific word use including connotation and indexicality. An example of an anthropologist who employed this type of methodology in her work is Deborah Schiffrin who isolated 12 words to analyze in her study of Jewish communities and their use of speech in Philadelphia. Linguistic analysis, methods such as examining linguistic structures and the roles they play within conversational discourse, play a large role in using discourse analysis to establish relational frameworks. Analysis focuses not only on linguistic forms such as words, sentences, grammar, phonology, etc. but also on subtle cues such as prosody and register that signal contextual presupposition. Linguistic based analysis is not the only component that is useful for establishing instances of Interactional sociolinguistics. Culture also plays a large role in understanding this phenomenon. Many linguistic anthropologists have come to understand that language and culture are not separate entities, but are in fact processes that work hand in hand. These contextualization cues are culturally specific and usually unconscious. Linguistic anthropology helps make explicit the implicit features of culture that can often be unknown to the speaker. When participants in a conversation come from different cultural backgrounds they may not recognize these subtle cues in one another's speech, leading to misunderstanding. This very idea of misunderstanding, contextualization, and culture, has been widely explored using Gumperz's framework of Interactional sociolinguistics. One of the main ways that Gumperz's framework is often utilized is in the context of jokes and how, when and why they are used by a specific culture in conversation. One anthropologist who has conducted research using the methodology of interactional sociolinguistics is Catherine Evans Davies. She uses it her ethnographic research to understand how beginning language learners start to make sense of social interaction in that language by using jokes in conversation with native speakers. In her work she discusses the usefulness of Gumperz's theory in her methodology as it stresses conversational analysis for the purpose of interpreting different linguistic practices, in this case humor and joking. Jokes, and humor are not the only area in which interactional sociolinguistic discourse analysis is useful. It is a valid and effective research framework for anyone interested in how language interacts with culture and meaning. Karen Grainger utilized it in her work involving relationships between care givers the elderly. In her article Reality Orientation in Institutions for the Elderly: The Perspective from Interactional Sociolinguistics, Karen Grainger uses Interactional sociolinguistics to push back against a process of elder therapy called \\"Reality Orientation.\\" In this piece Grainger uses discourse analysis to examine some of the scripts and modes of speech that the therapists abide by. Utilizing Gumperz's framework this way that showed that this type of therapy is perhaps creating a bigger divide between patients and staff. Here Grainger uses Interactional sociolinguistics to understand how power structures are established and maintained, whether deliberately or unwittingly. The theories behind Interactional sociolinguistics have no limit to the fields and areas of study to which they can be applied, for they provide answers to the ever present question of the relationship between culture and language.

Detentions and imprisonment   Initial detentions  Soon after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States government began detaining people who fit the profile of the suspected hijackers: mostly male, Arabic or Muslim noncitizens. By late November 2001, more than 1,200 people had been detained and held incommunicado.  Guantanamo camps  Detainees upon arrival at Camp X-Ray, January 2002 A major U.S. detainment facility is in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The facility is operated by Joint Task Force Guantanamo since 2002 at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, which is on the shore of Guant√°namo Bay.Afghan Prisoners Going to Gray Area: Military Unsure What Follows Transfer to U.S. Base in Cuba, Washington Post, January 9, 2002 The detainment areas consist of three camps: Camp Delta (which includes Camp Echo), Camp Iguana, and Camp X-Ray, the last of which has been closed. The facility is often referred to as Guantanamo, or Gitmo.Guantanamo Bay prisoners plant seeds of hope in secret garden , The Independent, April 29, 2006 -- mirror After the Justice Department advised that the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp could be considered outside U.S. legal jurisdiction, prisoners captured in Afghanistan were moved there beginning in early 2002. After the Bush administration asserted that detainees were not entitled to any of the protections of the Geneva Conventions, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld on June 29, 2006, that they were entitled to the minimal protections listed under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Following this, on July 7, 2006, the Department of Defense issued an internal memo stating that prisoners would in the future be entitled to protection under Common Article 3. The detainees held as of June 2008 have been classified by the United States as \\"enemy combatants\\". On January 22, 2009, the White House announced that President Barack Obama had signed an order to suspend the proceedings of the Guantanamo military commission for 120 days and that the detention facility would be shut down within the year. But as of January 2012, the Guantanamo camp is still operating. On January 29, 2009, a military judge at Guantanamo rejected the White House request in the case of Abd al-Rahim al- Nashiri, creating an unexpected challenge for the administration as it reviews how America puts Guantanamo detainees on trial. President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum dated December 15, 2009, ordering the preparation of the Thomson Correctional Center, in Thomson, Illinois, so as to enable the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners there.  Proceedings: Comparison with the American justice system Broadly speaking, the United States has two parallel justice systems, with laws, statutes, precedents, rules of evidence, and paths for appeal. Under these justice systems prisoners have certain rights. They have a right to know the evidence against them; they have a right to protect themselves against self-incrimination; they have a right to legal counsel; they have a right to have the witnesses against them cross-examined. These two justice systems are the judicial branch of the U.S. government, and a slightly streamlined justice system named the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ, for people under military jurisdiction. People undergoing a military court martial are entitled to the same basic rights as those in the civilian justice system. The Guantanamo military trials do not operate according to either system. The differences include: * The accused are not allowed access to all the evidence against them. The Presiding Officers are authorized to consider secret evidence the accused have no opportunity to refute.GQ Magazine August 2007 \\"The Defense Will Not Rest\\" by Sean Flynn Page one, fourth paragraph down * It may be possible for the commission to consider evidence that was extracted through coercive interrogation techniques before the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. However, legally the commission is restricted from considering any evidence extracted by torture, as defined by the Department of Defense. * The appointing officer in overall charge of the commissions is sitting in on them. He is authorized to shut down any commission, without warning, and without explanation. * The proceedings may be closed at the discretion of the presiding officer, so that secret information may be discussed by the commission. * The accused are not permitted a free choice of attorneys, as they can use only military lawyers or those civilian attorneys eligible for the secret security clearance. * Because the accused are charged as unlawful combatants, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that an acquittal on all charges by the commission is no guarantee of a release.  Iraq War  A dispute exists over the legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The debate centers around the question whether the invasion was an unprovoked assault on an independent country that may have breached international law, or whether the United Nations Security Council authorized the invasion (whether the conditions set in place after the Gulf War allowed the resumption if Iraq did not adhere to the Security Council resolutions). Those arguing for the war's legitimacy often point to Congressional Joint Resolution 114 and UN Security Council resolutions, such as Resolution 1441 and Resolution 678.International Law and the War in Iraq, John Yoo. The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 97, No. 3 (Jul., 2003), pp. 563-576 .Future Implications of the Iraq Conflict. W.H. Taft and T‚ÄôF. Buchwald. The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 97, No. 3 (Jul., 2003), pp. 553-563 , Those arguing against the war's legitimacy cite some of the same sources, stating they do not actually permit war but instead lay out conditions that must be met before war can be declared. Furthermore, the Security Council may only authorise the use of force against an \\"aggressor\\" in the interests of preserving peace, whereas the 2003 invasion of Iraq was not provoked by any aggressive military action. There has been heated debate regarding whether the invasion was started with the explicit authorization of the United Nations Security Council. The Government of the United States believes that the invasion was explicitly authorized by Security Council Resolution 678 and thus complies with international law. There is no debate that Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes UN Member States \\"to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area.\\", just debate about what that resolution actually means. The only legal jurisdiction to find \\"aggression\\" or to find the invasion illegal rests with the Security Council under United Nations Charter Articles 39-42. The Security Council met in 2003 for two days, reviewed the legal claims involved, and elected to be \\"seized of the matter\\".Patrick McLaren, 'Settling the Score with Saddam: Resolution 1441 and Parallel Justifications for the Use of Force against Iraq' (2003) 13 Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law 233 (Lexis); Bill Campbell and Chris Moraitis, 'Memorandum of Advice to the Commonwealth Government on the Use of Force against Iraq' (2003) 4 Melbourne Journal of International Law 178. The Security Council has not reviewed these issues since 2003. The public debate, however, continues. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed his opinion that the invasion of Iraq was \\"not in conformity with the UN charter ... from the charter point of view, ... [the invasion] was illegal.\\"Bennett-Jones, Owen (2004-09-16). Excerpts: Annan interview. BBC. Updated 2004-09-16. Retrieved 2009-04-18.  Abu Ghraib  Beginning in 2004, accounts of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, including torture, rape, sodomy, and homicide of prisoners held in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (also known as Baghdad Correctional Facility) came to public attention. These acts were committed by personnel of the 372nd Military Police Company of the United States Army together with additional US governmental agencies. Lynndie England holding a leash attached to a prisoner, known to the guards as \\"Gus\\", who is collapsed on the floor. As revealed by the 2004 Taguba Report, a criminal investigation by the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command had already been underway since 2003 where many soldiers of the 320th Military Police Battalion had been charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with prisoner abuse. In 2004 articles describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel abusing prisoners, came to public attention, when a 60 Minutes II news report (April 28) and an article by Seymour M. Hersh in The New Yorker magazine (posted online on April 30 and published days later in the May 10 issue) reported the story.Annals of National Security: Torture at Abu Ghraib: The New Yorker Janis Karpinski, the commander of Abu Ghraib, demoted for her lack of oversight regarding the abuse, estimated later that 90% of detainees in the prison were innocent. The United States Department of Defense removed seventeen soldiers and officers from duty, and eleven soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and March 2006, eleven soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner, and his former fianc√©e, Specialist Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten years and three years in prison, respectively, in trials ending on January 14, 2005 and September 26, 2005. The commanding officer at the prison, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, was demoted to the rank of Colonel on May 5, 2005. Col. Karpinski has denied knowledge of the abuses, claiming that the interrogations were authorized by her superiors and performed by subcontractors, and that she was not even allowed entry into the interrogation rooms. The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib was in part the reason that on April 12, 2006, the United States Army activated the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion, the first of four joint interrogation battalions.Army Activates First Interrogation Battalion, an April 2006 press release from the American Forces Press Service Further reading * The 9/11 Terror Cases: Constitutional Challenges in the War Against Al Qaeda by Allan A.

Madison Street is a major thoroughfare of Seattle, Washington. The street originates at Alaskan Way on the Seattle waterfront, and heads northeast through Downtown Seattle, First Hill, Capitol Hill, Madison Valley, Washington Park, and Madison Park, ending just east of 43rd Avenue East on Lake Washington. From Broadway to Lake Washington, the street is known as East Madison Street, which accounts for most of its length. It is the only Seattle street that runs uninterrupted from the salt water of Puget Sound in the west to the fresh water of Lake Washington in the east. Madison street on a 1915 cover Many notable buildings are located along the street, including the Seattle Central Library and numerous hotels such as the Sorrento Hotel. For most of the run from Broadway to 12th Avenue, it forms the northern boundary of the Seattle University campus. Public transportation Cable car cable car tracks A cable car line provided public transportation along all or part of Madison Street from 1890 to 1940. It was constructed and operated by the Madison Street Cable Railway company. The original powerhouse, which powered the cables running under the streets, was located between 21st and 22nd Avenues, and the service was operated as two separate lines‚Äîwest from the powerhouse to downtown and east from the powerhouse to Madison Park on Lake Washington and, together, the two lines served the entire length of Madison Street. Capitol Hill, later the Fine Arts Building of Seattle University The western cable car line opened in spring 1890, and in downtown it terminated at a turntable on West Street (now Western Avenue), near the ferry terminal on Puget Sound. The line east from 21st to \\"Lake Washington and Madison Park\\" terminus opened in June 1891. In 1910, the line east from 21st was closed, replaced by electric streetcars. After the construction of a new powerhouse near 10th Avenue, the line from the downtown waterfront to 21st was cut back from the latter point to there in 1911, but the section between 10th and 14th was restored to operation in 1913. This left a line between the downtown waterfront and 14th Avenue, which could not be converted to streetcars because it included some sections with grades too steep for streetcars. It ran for the last time on April 13, 1940. Electric streetcar service on East Madison Street (route 11) ended on January 10, 1940, temporarily replaced by motor buses until April 30, 1940, when trolleybuses began operating on route 11. Bus A trolleybus eastbound on Madison Street in 2015 The Seattle trolleybus system has served Madison Street since 1940, primarily with routes 11-East Madison St. (converted to diesel buses in 1965) and 13-19th Avenue (renumbered 12 in 1984). Currently, King County Metro bus route 11 serves Madison Street east of 16th Avenue East, and trolleybus route 12 serves Madison Street between downtown (1st Avenue) and 19th Avenue East. The Seattle Department of Transportation is studying the implementation of a bus rapid transit line along Madison Street between the waterfront and 27th Avenue, known as the RapidRide G Line.

Its last was assigned to the Eastern Transport Air Force, Military Air Transport Service, stationed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. It was inactivated on 8 January 1966. With the disestablishment of MATS, the assets of the Wing were reassigned to the 436th Military Airlift Wing, Military Airlift Command. History Following World War II, Dover Air Force Base was reactivated on 1 February 1951 and assigned under the jurisdiction of the Air Defense Command (ADC). At this time the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard (ANG) was recalled to active duty from Reading Air Force Base and assigned to Dover. On 1 February 1952, the 80th Air Base Squadron was activated at Dover to provide housekeeping duties for the four tenant units that had arrived on the base by that date. They were the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, the 1737th Ferrying Squadron, Detachment 1909-6 Airways and Communications Services and Detachment 4, 9th Weather Group. On 1 April 1952, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) assumed command jurisdiction of the base. Concurrent with this action, the 80th Air Base Squadron was relieved of assignment to ADC and assigned to MATS, with further assignment to the Atlantic Division (MATS), headquartered at Westover AFB, Massachusetts; which in 1958, was re-designated as the Eastern Transport Air Force (EASTAF) and moved to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. In addition, Congress appropriated $25 million to expand and transform Dover Air Force Base into a supplemental east coast port of embarkation for MATS and as a Foreign Clearing Base for ferrying flights headed to Europe, the Caribbean, and to the countries of the north. On 1 August 1953, the 80th Air Base Squadron was inactivated and reverted to the control of the Department of the Air Force. Concurrent with this action, four units of the Atlantic Division were organized at Dover, the 1607th Air Base Group (ABG), the 1607th Air Base Squadron, the 1607th Maintenance and Supply Squadron and the 1607th Medical Squadron. On 18 November 1953, the first two transport squadrons, the 1st Air Transport Squadron (ATS) and the 21st Air Transport Squadron (ATS), \\"Medium\\", which flew the Douglas C-54G, were reconstituted, re-designated and assigned to the 1607th Air Base Group. This would be the nucleus of the 1607th Air Transport Wing (ATW). On 22 December 1953, the Secretary of the Air Force designated Dover Air Force Base as a permanent military installation. On 1 January 1954, the 1607th Air Transport Wing was designated, assigned to Atlantic Division MATS, and organized at Dover Air Force Base. By the same orders the 1607th Air Transport Group (ATG) was designated and organized in preparation for the start of transport mission operations from the base. On 15 February 1954, the 39th, and the 45th Air Transport Squadrons, were reconstituted and assigned to the 1607th Air Transport Group. The 39th Air Transport Squadron was subsequently designated \\"Medium\\" and the 45th Air Transport Squadron was designated as a \\"Heavy\\" squadron, indicating the type of aircraft that was and would be assigned to these units. The initial transport mission of the newly activated Air Transport Group was accomplished when a C-54 operated by the 1st Air Transport Squadron (Medium) delivered a 9,000 pound radio mast to Harmon Field, Newfoundland. On 8 March 1954, the 40th Air Transport Squadron (Heavy) was reconstituted and assigned to the Wing. On 1 May 1954, the first Douglas C-124 Globemaster II arrived at Dover and on 12 June, the 45th Air Transport Squadron flew the first C-124 \\"heavy\\" transport mission, airlifting five engines to Harmon Field, Newfoundland and a 12,000 pound spool of cable to Torbay Air Base, Newfoundland. On 8 September 1954, the 1st and 21st Air Transport Squadrons were re-designated from \\"Medium\\" to \\"Heavy\\" transport units, respectively as the C-54s assigned to these units were replaced with the C-124. On 20 September 1954, the 1607th Air Transport Wing and its headquarters were re-designated the 1607th Air Transport Wing (Heavy). The same order added \\"Heavy\\" to the designation of the 1607th Air Transport Group. Headquarters 1607th Air Transport Wing, about 1960 1607th Air Transport Wing Operations Center, about 1960 C-133 Cargomaster aircraft in hangars for maintenance, about 1960 C-124 Globemaster II engine maintenance Throughout the years there were many changes to the organizations under the 1607th Air Transport Wing. In 1955, C-124 units such as the 15th, the 20th and the 31st Air Transport Squadrons were relocated from Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts when MATS closed its facilities there. Along with the relocation of these units both the 21st and 45th Air Transport Squadrons were inactivated. The 40th was inactivated in December 1960 and its personnel were absorbed into the other units. With the arrival of the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster in 1957, the 39th Air Transport Squadron was re-designated a C-133 unit with the 1st Air Transport Squadron to follow in 1960. The most significant reorganization occurred on 18 January 1963, when the wing was reorganized under the MATS dual deputy concept of operations. This reorganization resulted in the discontinuance of the 1607th Air Transport Group (Heavy) and the 1607th Maintenance Group, transferring their responsibilities to a Deputy Commander for Operations (DCO), a Deputy Commander for Material (DCM) and the 1607th Air Base Group (ABG). In November 1964, the Secretary of Defense announced that eighty Department of Defense activities within the United States would be reduced or discontinued and that a troop carrier squadron would be transferred to Dover Air Force Base. Thus, in January 1965, the 15th Air Transport Squadron would inactivate along with the activation of the 9th Troop Carrier Squadron. Both the 20th and the 31st Air Transport Squadrons followed suit and were re-designated as troop carrier squadrons. This designation would be temporary for the 20th, as it would revert to its previous designation as a transport squadron. On 1 February 1965, MATS announced that Dover was selected as one of four bases where the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter would be tested under a program called \\"Lead the Force\\". The first C-141 arrived at Dover Air Force Base on 18 August 1965 and was assigned to the 20th Air Transport Squadron. The initial mission of the 1607th Air Transport Wing (Heavy) was \\"to command, operate, administer and maintain Dover Air Force Base and such organizations, installations and facilities as may be assigned by proper authority for the purpose of transporting by air, personnel, material, mail, strategic materials and other cargoes for all agencies of the Department of Defense (DOD) and as authorized for other government agencies of the United States, subject to priorities and policies established by higher headquarters\\". The mission responsibilities of the Wing were later expanded considerably. In the following years, the 1607th Air Transport Wing assumed the additional responsibility for logistical airlift operations including unit deployment, airdrop supply, air landed supply, scheduled and nonscheduled airlift, as well as joint airborne operations and training to include the capability for airdrop of personnel and cargo. As a unit of the Military Air Transport Service, the 1607th Air Transport Wing had its share of responsibilities in major joint mobility exercises and global operations conducted during the \\"Cold War\\". Examples include: Big Slam/Puerto Pine, March 1960, was an exercise that deployed 22,000 combat Army troops and 12,000 tons of gear from stateside bases to Ramey AFB and Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, Puerto Rico; Check Mate II, September 1961, involved the deployment of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to bases in Europe; Southern Express, October 1962, a NATO exercise which involved airlifting troops from central Europe to northern Greece; Big Lift, October 1963, the deployment of a full Army division from Texas to West Germany; The Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962. In support of President John F. Kennedy's decision to blockade Cuba, Dover Air Force Base was called upon to support the build-up of forces in the southeastern United States. The Wing and its aircrews worked at peak capacity airlifting troops and supplies from bases throughout the country to Florida and Guantanamo Bay. History shows that we were within 36 hours of a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union; the Congo Airlift, also known as Operation \\"New Tape\\", was, at the time, history's longest lasting operational airlift, lasting 3 1/2 years, from 1960 to 1964; Operation Good Hope, September 1957, the airlift of arms support to Jordan. Forty vehicles equipped with 109 mm weapons were carried in five C-124s that flew in formation from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia to Amman, Jordan; Project ICE CUBE, May 1955, supported the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line in northern Canada; Polar Strike, January 1965, was conducted to evaluate U.S. STRICOM's ability to reinforce the Alaskan Command. During the years what seemed impossible to many was considered routine day-to- day operations to the aircrews of the 1607th Air Transport Wing. In December 1958, a Dover AFB C-133 airlifted the heaviest load in the history of aviation when it carried 118,000 pounds of cargo to an altitude of 10,000 feet, breaking the former world record held by a Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 \\"Camel\\"; on 7 February 1960, a Dover C-124 with a 15th Air Transport Squadron aircrew flew a record breaking non-stop flight from Hickam AFB, Hawaii to Dover AFB in eighteen hours and forty minutes; a C-124 of the 1st Air Transport Squadron was assigned temporary duty to the 54th Air Rescue Squadron at Goose Bay, Labrador to aid in the rescue of 26 passengers and 8 crew members of a Norwegian vessel ice bound off the coast of Greenland; in March 1956, 22,000 pounds of emergency polio equipment and supplies were airlifted to Buenos Aires to help combat a polio outbreak; the AMIGO Airlift, mercy missions to Santiago, Chile in May 1960, when an earthquake literally re-made parts of that country; in 1962, the four-month round the world tour of John Glenn's space capsule Friendship 7 ; many re-supply missions from Thule Air Base, Greenland to the northernmost weather outposts at Nord, Greenland and Alert, both within just some 500 miles of the North Pole; the delivery of a telespectrograph to Ascension Island in support of the space project FIRE. It was the first time such an instrument was airlifted as a complete unit; the airlift of supplies and emergency equipment to Alaska after an earthquake struck that state in March 1964; the presidential support mission of John F. Kennedy, in July 1963, when he spoke the famous words \\"Ich Bin Ein Berliner\\", at the Berlin Wall. These are but a few of the approximate 75 significant events added to the normal day to day global airlift operations, of which the 1607th Air Transport Wing was involved. During its twelve-year history at Dover, the 1607th ATW accumulated 1,076,483 transport flying hours or an approximate equivalent distance of 235 million nautical miles. The 1607th Air Transport Wing (Heavy) was assigned to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) throughout its history and, on 8 January 1966, the 1607th was discontinued and the 436th Military Airlift Wing was activated when the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) was replaced by the Military Airlift Command (MAC). The 1st, 20th, and 39th Air Transport Squadrons \\"Heavy\\" and the 9th and 31st Troop Carrier Squadrons \\"Heavy\\" were all re-designated as Military Airlift Squadrons. There were 70 heavy transport aircraft assigned, on 8 January 1966, with over 8,000 military and civilian personnel. Its C-124 Globemasters, C-133 Cargomasters and the newly acquired C-141 Starlifters maintained a D-Day state of readiness to airlift men and material for the United States and allied military forces whenever and wherever needed. In addition, the Wing's mercy airlifts to nations suffering natural disasters, and its United Nations airlift effort in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other areas of the world, bolstered US national policy in the Cold War.

Started by Sam and Anna Hirt, its early focus was on horseradish and vegetables, which Sam Hirt sold in Cleveland.Hirt's Greenhouse in 1940 It is believed that Sam intended to pass the business directly to his eldest son, Paul Hirt, but Paul Hirt died in 1918 when the merchant marine ship he was on, the Otranto, sank off the coast of England. So Sam Hirt passed the business to some of his other sons, most notably Lawrence Hirt, Arthur Hirt, and Hobart Hirt. Lawrence and Arthur started Hirt's Wholesale, which supplied florists supplies, vegetable seedlings, and houseplants to the retail business run by Hobart and his wife, Onalee (n√©e Baker). The retail business was initially called Strongsville Greenhouse and was located at 13867 Pearl Rd, Strongsville, Ohio.Hirt's Gardens Today The three children of Hobart and Onalee Hirt were Marie, Clare, and Alan. All worked at the greenhouse in the 1960s and 1970s, and the business was passed on to Clare and Alan in the mid-1970s, who were joined by a third business partner, Paul King, whom they had met at Ohio State University. By then, the greenhouses were known as Hirt's Greenhouse and Flowers. For a while, they operated small florists‚Äô outlets at two popular northeast Ohio malls, Great Northern Mall and Beachwood Place. Alan Hirt (along with his wife at the time, Karen Hirt) found great success appearing on local news and radio shows, where they answered common gardening questions. By the late 1990s, the successful business included a floral shop and 14 greenhouses wall-to-wall at the intersections of Pearl Road and Royalton Road, one of the busiest corners in Strongsville. In 2004, the property was sold to developers, but the business did not end. Clare Hirt took over the floral part of the business, called it Hirt's Flowers, and re-located down the road from the original business at 14407 Pearl Rd. Hirt's Flowers was then sold in 2014, and while it retains the Hirt name, it is no longer run by the Hirt family. Alan Hirt and his son, Matthew Hirt, took over the horticulture part of the business, now called Hirt's Gardens. It is now located at 4943 Ridge Rd. The original Strongsville greenhouses were demolished in 2005.

It is native to the southern half of North America, including much of the United States except for the northwestern quadrant, and much of Mexico. It is resident in many types of moist and wet habitat, including disturbed areas, such as irrigation ditches. It is a perennial herb growing decumbent in a matlike form with spreading, trailing stems up to half a meter long, sometimes rooting at nodes. The lance-shaped or nearly oval leaves are up to 6 centimeters long and have toothed or partially toothed edges. The inflorescence, arising on a peduncle several centimeters tall, is a spherical spike of flowers which elongates into a cylindrical form as the fruits develop. The tiny, densely packed flowers are white, sometimes tinged with blue or purple. It is similar to the related species Phyla nodiflora, but differs in having much longer and more pointed leaves. Both species are common as weeds and in the ornamental environment. An older scientific name for this species is Lippia lanceolata, and in some older references 'frogfruit' is provided as a common name. The Acadian French name for the plant is \\"caille eau,\\" stemming from the superstition that it can curdle water.

The plan was approved in July 1966 by President Charles de Gaulle, in the aftermath of two key events that made his government worry about French dependence on the US computer industry. In the mid-1960s, the United States denied export licenses for American-made IBM and CDC computers to the French Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique in order to prevent it from perfecting its H bomb. Meanwhile, in 1964, General Electric had acquired a majority of Compagnie des Machines Bull, the largest French computer manufacturer, which had the second highest market share in France, after IBM, and was a leading IT equipment maker in Europe. Following this partial takeover, known as \\"Affaire Bull\\", GE-Bull dropped two Bull computers from its product line.Pierre Mounier-Kuhn, ‚ÄúFrom General Electric to Bull: A case of managerial knowledge transfer (1956-1970)‚Äù, Entreprises et Histoire, June 2014, n¬∞ 75, p. 42-56 (http://www.cairn.info/revue-entreprises-et-histoire-2014-2-page-42.htm) Responsibility for administering the plan was given to a newly created government agency, (Information Bureau), answering directly to the prime minister. As part of the program, in December 1966, the Compagnie internationale pour l'informatique (CII) was established as a manufacturer of commercial and scientific computers, initially under licence from Scientific Data Systems. The new company was intended to compete not only in the process control and military market, where its staff was already seasoned, but also in the office computing sector of the French market, where IBM and Bull were dominant at the time. The plan enacted government subsidies for CII between 1967 and 1971, and was reconducted for another four years. A minor side of the plan was devoted to peripherals, while CII's main parent company, Thomson-CSF, received government support to develop its semiconductor plants and R & D. Overall, while CII mainframes benefitted from preferential procurement by the French government, the Plan Calcul left peripherals, components and small computers makers compete on the free market. The same went for software companies, which were already thriving in France. On the research side, the program also led to the creation of L'Institut de recherche en informatique et en automatique (IRIA) in 1967, which later became INRIA. It was accompanied with a vast educational effort in programming and computer science. In the late 1960s, CII announced its new, internally designed mainframes Iris 50 [1970] and Iris 80 [1971], and developed a mini-computer, Mitra 15 (1971), which became a commercial success in the following decade. The company also was a minority participant in the production of magnetic periphals thru part ownership of Magnetic Peripherals Inc. IBM had more than 50% market share in almost every European country. Information Bureau head warned that international cooperation was necessary, however, as \\"something must happen or there won't be a European computer industry\\". The French government had spent more than $100 million on Plan Calcul in the first five years, and planned to spend more than that amount in the next five. France expected CII to reach $200 million in revenue before 1975. That year, CII began negotiations with Siemens and Philips to form a joint European company, Unidata, which shipped its first computers in 1974. Yet a new President of the Republic was elected then, former Finance minister Giscard d'Estaing, who was a strong opponent of the Plan Calcul; meanwhile, CII's sleeping partner, CGE-Alcatel, woke up to oppose the domination of its archrival Siemens over the European computer industry. Unidata was terminated and CII was absorbed into Honeywell-Bull in 1976. This government initiative was ultimately deemed a failure.\\"CII failed because ‚Äúoffensive protectionism‚Äù was impossible, because computers are commercial products and the state is a buyer, it is not an infrastructure project. CII failed because although the State financed the whole project, private owners of CII had a different agenda.\\" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10842-007-0024-8  See also   References  Category:History of computing Category:Politics of France Category:Science and technology in France Category:1966 in France Category:Computer-related introductions in 1966 ","title":"Plan Calcul"},{"id":"26092583","text":"Manshots was an international film review magazine specializing in gay pornography.

It reached the point of offering classes K through 10th grade. The building survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and was the site of a clinic during the relief effort. General information The An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ Bah√° º√≠ School (Ecole Bah√° º√≠e An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠), named for the companion who suffered execution with the B√°b, began classes in 1980 and grew into a K-9 primary and secondary school, serving 232 students by 1983, 270 by 1988. For a time the secondary school program was closed to focus on K-4th primary school offerings. The secondary program re-opened in September 2004 and has added one class per year since then and by 2009 the school was a K-10 school (intending on becoming a full high school and offering national exams.) Its initial funding and operating budget for years came from the business income of a Belgian Bah√° º√≠ family, Pari Hosseinpour and Hassan-Ali Kamran. The student population comes mostly from no- to low-income families, and most students are only paying minimal or no fees to attend the school. It follows the national curriculum but also provides moral education and English classes. It is situated on about three acres of land in what has become a suburb several miles north east of Port-au-Prince proper (and a few miles north west of Croix-des-Bouquets.) When the school was established, the area was rural and underdeveloped. A 220 V power line was brought in from Bon Repos to provide the school with electricity, and the first telephone line reached the school only in 1989. An artesian well was drilled and provided drinking water to the school as well as to the public through a pipe ending at a fountain at the Bon Repos-Beudet road. In October 1982 R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum, a Hand of the Cause, a position of prominence in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, presided at the official inauguration ceremony for the school. The initial board of directors were Counsellor Farzam Arbab, Dr. Nabil Hanna, Benjamin Levy, Dr. Iraj Majzub and Georges Marcellus. The first school principal came from Germany in 1980 (Hans J Thimm, later of Union School, Haiti.). Current directors are Sue and Yves Puzo. The area has been built up with private homes and businesses and the school has been broken into twice forcing security infrastructure additions. The arable land in the vicinity of the school is no longer being worked due to lack of water and lack of initiative on the part of the youth who prefer to find other means of employment that are easier or more lucrative. The Mona Foundation has supported the school with funding for support of satellite schools, scholarships, regular summer camps, and general funding as well as acting as a mediator of larger scale funding for infrastructure improvements. Program The program at the school involves: * In September 2003 the school opened an afternoon program for children who were too old, too poor, or too busy to attend the morning sessions. * There are classes on moral education, English, folk dancing, sewing, computer classes, and crafts and an annual school outing. * Materials used start in Kindergarten through 4th grade were prepared in Columbia that concentrate on building spiritual qualities. In grades 3 and 4 they follow lessons from the Virtues Guide in French. In grades 5 to 9 they follow the pre-youth courses: ‚ÄúBreezes of Confirmation‚Äù, ‚ÄúGlimmerings of Hope‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWalking the Straight Path‚Äù. * Teacher training has been a part of the school's schedule for the past 15 years. However, with the turnover in staff there are no teachers that have been here longer than five, and most only one or two, years. This requires a constant assessment of needs and further instruction to fill the gaps. *The school has charged $10 per month per child, although for many even this amount is not affordable. *The main school is responsible for two satellite schools in Guerot and Pont Benoit, each serving around 50 students: the New Horizon School, which is run by Bernard Martinod, a French architect and the Georges Marcellus School in the rural village of Gureot. Development projects The school has acted as a base of a number of development projects:The main source of information about individual projects ended publication in 1990 so further information isn't available as yet. *In 1984 the school began publication of a quarterly newspaper, \\"Timun\\" (which in Haitian Creole means children or, more literally, \\"little people\\") and subtitled \\"Development of Baha'i Education in Haiti.\\" *With the help of CARE, a food program was started. The first grade teacher noticed a great difference in his 6-8 year olds. Before, many children in the area only ate once a day (in the afternoon or evening), and were tired during the mornings. The poorer families with many children and little income even skipped a day or two. In this situation, the lunch provided by the school helped increase the students' receptivity. *When the school started in 1980, the average age of students starting school was 10 years. When the school became the springboard for six pre-school centers managed by the school's Development Project in several neighboring villages, parents were even more encouraged to send their children to school at an earlier age. After about five years, the situation had normalized, and students entering first grade were now mostly 6-7 year olds. *From 1983 to 1984 funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Universal House of Justice was spent on a development project run through the school. 20 volunteers from the school were trained in various subjects. Initially a survey encompassing 98 households and 216 individuals in Lilavois, Depio, Savanne Blonde, S√©gur and Cesleste was undertaken. Mini-cooperatives and women's committees met discussing possible initiatives. In Lilavois and Liancourt they were interested in crafts, cooking, sewing and, to some extent, literacy and upgrading of those skills. In the Artibonite valley they created 17 mini- cooperatives composed of friends who invest in commercial or agricultural projects with their own money in a microfinance arrangement. \\"Animation\\" techniques and quotes from Bah√° º√≠ literature were compiled. Demonstration gardens were set up. The Local Spiritual Assembly of Liancourt carried development after the project in their area independently from the initial work through the school. Four village early childhood education centers were built, with teachers being partially supported by the parents in those villages. Projects continued to advance in 1986. *A technical-vocational program developed through the school in 1985 established a small iron and wood workshop in a modest building. With funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), tools were procured, and the first seven apprentices were trained. The workshop produced furniture, seedling racks, a sand sifter, bee-keeping hives and frames, and decorative and protective ironwork for windows and gates. However this program ceased around 2002 when the schools program focused on primary grades. * After receiving seed funding from the Pan American Development Foundation in 1985-6, the school initiated a grafter tree project producing 80,000 seedlings a year. This was extended and accelerated in 1987. And teacher orientation and training to further integrate school based development projects and schooling and the Spiritual Assembly of Lilavois supervised projects in its area. * In May 1986 filming for a documentary on the school was begun and it evolved into a 20-minute documentary video From Haitian Roots about education and development projects accomplished by the school. * During the first years, a primer (Bondye Bon) and a second-year reader (Bo lakay nou) were developed in Creole to help children read and write in their native language. In 1987 the school developed a third-grade French-language reader, Ouvrons la Porte, to help in the transition from Haitian Creole to French by introducing one French sound at a time while otherwise using already known Creole letters and words. While methods employed by most other schools enabled students to read (but not understand) French mainly by rote memorizing, the three books (developed by Matty Bellows Thimm, the second school principal) made students functional in literacy. All books use pictures and stories containing Bah√° º√≠ principles, although they do not refer specifically to the religion. Recent situation The school has a Facebook presence. In September 2009 there was filming for a documentary about Mona Foundation projects including the An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ school. The principal of the An√≠s Zun√∫z√≠ School reported on January 17, 2010 that the school buildings were generally still standing after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors. A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. The group has since organized under the name Love for Haiti; it had organized spontaneously, largely through Facebook. The group gave a presentation on their Haiti experience at St. Matthews Parish Hall in Hoboken, NJ on Feb. 18, and returned to Haiti in March. The group included one photo journalist.

With this end in mind, he had studied law and joined the debating society in college. He openly acknowledged that he enjoyed the showmanship of politics and was at first unsure of the course his political career would take. He simply wanted to go into politics‚Äìnot to accomplish anything in particular. At first he served in minor positions, assisting other politicians and over time he developed his own political consciousness. Colby became convinced that the American political system had become perverted from a representative democracy to a plutocratic tyranny. He had been advised to gain experience by joining forces with Major Carl Lentz, the chairman of the Republican County Committee of Essex County. Lentz allowed him to be the introductory speaker at some meetings and Colby gained experience in giving speeches. He then transferred to the staff of Governor Voorhees. Voorhees appointed him a Commissioner on the State Board of Education. Colby worried that his own desultory education might make him unfit for the position but he did very well and Lentz made him chairman of the executive committee of the Republican organization of West Orange in 1902. The next year, Lentz encouraged Colby to run for state senator for Essex. When Colby pointed out that he was under the constitutional age for the senate, Lentz offered to \\"fix the Manual\\" where the statistics of legislators were kept. Colby refused but agreed to nomination for the State Assembly and was elected Assemblyman from Essex. New Jersey State Assemblyman Colby's session as an assemblyman was a gradual education and disillusionment. One day, early in the session, Sam Dickinson asked Colby to introduce certain excise bills. Dickinson was Secretary of State and Republican leader of Hudson County. Colby found the proposed taxes dubious and an attempt to take control of Hudson County from the Democratic Party. Colby went to consult Governor Franklin Murphy and when Murphy pronounced the bills \\"all right\\", Colby was reassured. At the same time, Colby wanted to introduce a bill to clean up pollution of the Passaic River but the Republicans did not have enough votes for all the bills to pass. Colby and some other Republicans appealed to the Democratic assemblymen from Hudson who agreed to support the clean-up bill if the excise bills were dropped. Dickinson consented and Colby's bill was passed. Then Dickinson asked Colby to reintroduce the excise bills. Colby was astonished and refused to break his word. \\"Your word to a Democrat doesn't mean anything,\\" they told him in those very terms. The party jammed through the excise bills but Colby voted against them, retaining his honor. Leader of the House Colby continued to make enemies in his own party by voting in opposition to their views on major issues. Later he acknowledged that some of his decisions were bad ones. They tried to buy his cooperation by making him floor leader of the Republican majority House. They handled him very carefully, concealing information from him and approaching him through men he liked. Republicans had attempted to introducing a bill requiring twenty percent approval by shareholders for a lawsuit to be filed against a corporation by its workforce. The party sent Percy Rockefeller to convince Colby to support the bill. He failed and Colby convinced Rockefeller that the bill was a bad one. When both Governor Murphy and Governor Stokes then attempted to convert Colby, this opened the eyes of the young legislator to the fact that his party represented the interests of corporations. During the 1904 session, Mark M. Fagan, the mayor of Jersey City, attempted to obtain relief from the burden the railroads placed upon the city. They paid almost no taxes to the city and Fagan, a Republican appealed to the Republican leadership including Colby. At first Colby supported the bill, but when he was told by his party leaders that the bill was \\"badly drawn,\\" he changed his position. When asked why, he replied that he was too inexperienced to draw up a bill himself. He said, > We were incompetent. Perhaps some of us might, once upon a time, have been > legislators; but boss rule was so old there that we didn't, we couldn't > think for ourselves. We had lost the art of independent thought and work. We > were dummies. We took orders, we waited for orders, we depended upon orders. > Dummy legislators, that's what we were. Frustrated with their own party, Mayor Fagan and his corporation counsel George L. Record went to the Democrats who drew up a bill. The bill was buried in committee. Fagan went to Colby and asked him why he didn't have it reported. \\"I can't,\\" Colby told him, \\"I'm not really a leader. I'm the real leader's dummy.\\" A year later, at a Republican caucus, Colby asked why the bill could not be debated in the House. \\"Why, 'the Penn' (Pennsylvania Railroad) would raise hell,\\" was the reply. \\"There was the reason, the real reason,\\" said Colby in an interview later. \\"When the Mayor who represented the people of the second city in the state asked the legislature to consider a bill in their interest, that Jersey legislature couldn't because it represented 'the Penn,' a foreign corporation.\\" Republican Mayor Fagan sent an open letter to Governor Murphy and it was read aloud in the House of Assembly. It said among other things, > ...The present session is drawing to a close. Its record is ... disgraceful. > Its control by corporation interests ... has been absolute. ... For that > condition the Republican party is responsible. ... What is the meaning of > all this? The answer is plain! A Republican legislature is controlled by the > railroad, trolley, and water corporations. And the interests of the people > are being betrayed. Later Colby said, \\"I was sore at myself. It was true. We were dummies; we betrayed the people who elected us.\\" In response, Colby threw himself into a study of taxation. In 1905, Colby wanted to run for Speaker of the House but was discouraged by his party leaders. His refractory ways troubled them greatly. But they told him that he could not be elected. He knew this was untrue because he had pledges from his colleagues. So he ignored them. He was summoned to a meeting with Senator Dryden, the president of Prudential Life Insurance Company. Dryden told him that if he ran for Speaker, it would weaken the prestige of their delegation to run and fail. Colby told him about the pledges and Dryden responded, \\"But Tom McCarter says it won't do.\\" That settled it. McCarter spoke for the trolley business. Colby agreed not to run but decided to run as a freelance. The city of Newark was as plagued by corruption and bribery as was Jersey City. Both the Democrats and Republicans were involved in this. A few members of reform movements came to Colby with pleas of support. William P. Martin headed a few young men, mainly Republicans, who got into councils and opposed steadfastly the public utility grabs. Not finding satisfaction at the local level, both sides went to the legislature. The citizens of Newark petitioned the legislature to forbid their council to grant any franchise for a period longer than twenty-five years. They found that none of their legislators would touch their bill. They didn't represent them, they represented big business. This is when they appealed to Colby. He said that he would have to study the subject. Soon thereafter, Colby was at a dinner and walked over to Tom McCarter afterwards and asked him if he knew about the proposed bill. McCarter was not interested in discussing the matter. He clapped his hands together in Colby's face saying that he would not accept anything but perpetual franchises. Colby said that had he tried to persuade him with reason, he could probably have been swayed but this was eye- opening. McCarter considered his dictatorial powers absolute. Later McCarter's brother Uzel tried to persuade Colby with flattery, \\"We think you have a political future before you, and we don't want to see you throw it away.\\" Uncorrupted, Colby decided to introduce a resolution to put the legislature on record, believing that a limited franchise bill could not be passed. He told no one of it except Edward Duffield the House leader. Colby rose and offered a resolution to the effect that it was the sense of this House that perpetual grants of monopolies to corporations should not be made. The leader adopted the resolution with not one negative vote. But before the Speaker declared the resolution carried, the House woke up and begged, \\"Can't you give us time?\\" Other achievements Colby was a trustee of his alma mater Brown University from 1905 to 1940. He was a member of the New Jersey board of Education from 1902 to 1904. He was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1903 to 1905, and of the state senate from 1906 to 1909. An ardent supporter of President Theodore Roosevelt, he was Progressive candidate for governor of New Jersey in 1912. He was chairman of the executive committee of the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association and of the National World Court Committee. He served in the United States Food Administration in 1917. He was a major in the Officers Reserve Corps in 1918. Personal life When Everett was 15 years old, the city of Everett, Washington was named after him at an 1890 dinner party at his father's home, as suggested by Henry Hewitt. The city was started just 2 years later.Snohomish County, An Illustrated History, 2005 Colby married Edith Hyde of Plainfield, New Jersey in 1903. Four of their children survived him. He died on June 19, 1943, in Montclair, New Jersey. He had been suffering from a heart condition for several weeks.\\"Everett Colby Dies in Montclair, N.J.\\" (June 25, 1943) Newport Mercury And Weekly News, Newport, Rhode Island An obituary in the Bradford Era read, > Had Everett Colby died 30 or 35 years ago, his death would have been > reported all over the country.

Compatibility means that it is invariant under the adjoint representation. Examples of such are semisimple Lie algebras, such as su(n) and sl(n,R).  Definition  A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra (g,[.,.]) together with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form (.,.)\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} that is invariant under the adjoint action, i.e. :([X,Y],Z)+(Y,[X,Z])=0 where X,Y,Z are elements of the Lie algebra g. A localization/ generalization is the concept of Courant algebroid where the vector space g is replaced by (sections of) a vector bundle.  Examples  As a first example, consider Rn with zero-bracket and standard inner product :((x_1,\\\\dots,x_n),(y_1,\\\\dots,y_n)):= \\\\sum_j x_jy_j. Since the bracket is trivial the invariance is trivially fulfilled. As a more elaborate example consider so(3), i.e. R3 with base X,Y,Z, standard inner product, and Lie bracket :[X,Y]=Z,\\\\quad [Y,Z]=X,\\\\quad [Z,X]=Y. Straightforward computation shows that the inner product is indeed preserved. A generalization is the following.  Semisimple Lie algebras  A big group of examples fits into the category of semisimple Lie algebras, i.e. Lie algebras whose adjoint representation is faithful. Examples are sl(n,R) and su(n), as well as direct sums of them. Let thus g be a semi-simple Lie algebra with adjoint representation ad, i.e. :\\\\mathrm{ad}\\\\colon\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to\\\\mathrm{End}(\\\\mathfrak{g}):X\\\\mapsto (\\\\mathrm{ad}_X\\\\colon Y\\\\mapsto [X,Y]). Define now the Killing form :k\\\\colon\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}: X\\\\otimes Y \\\\mapsto -\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\mathrm{ad}_X\\\\circ\\\\mathrm{ad}_Y). Due to the Cartan criterion, the Killing form is non-degenerate if and only if the Lie algebra is semisimple. If g is in addition a simple Lie algebra, then the Killing form is up to rescaling the only invariant symmetric bilinear form.

He was arguably one of the most successful chiefs of staff; he rose to the rank of Feldmarshalleutnant during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. He developed a sound military reputation as a surveyor, map-maker, and strategist during Austria's wars with the Ottoman Empire. He served on the Quartermaster's staff during the War of the First Coalition. He was the mastermind behind the Rhine Campaign of 1796. As a major general, he was one of Archduke Charles' trusted advisers during the War of the Second Coalition campaign in southwestern Germany. In 1799, his reputation was tarnished by the assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt, but his complicity was not proven. He retired the following year due to conflicts with the new commander in chief of the Habsburg army. When war broke out again in 1805, he was recalled from retirement and assigned to the combined Russian-Austrian forces on the Danube. On 11 November, Schmitt was killed by friendly fire at the Battle of D√ºrenstein. Family and education Johann Heinrich von Schmitt was born in 1743, the son of Johann Sebastian von Schmitt, a Rittmeister (cavalry captain) in the Imperial Cuirassier Regiment Graf Cordova.Regiments of the Austrian military bore the name of a noble, reflecting the Habsburg perception of its military as a people in arms. The noble held the title of Proprietor (Inhaber) and Colonel. If the noble was of significantly high rank, a second colonel was appointed to manage the day-to- day affairs of the regiment. In this case, the Inhaber was Kaspar Ferdinand, Graf Cordova, General of Cavalry and Field Marshal; he served as Inhaber from 1726 until his death in 1756. Alphons Wrede, Geschichte der K.u.K.

In 1742-1743, during the War of Austrian Succession, his father's regiment participated in the Battle of Sahay (Zah√°j√≠ in Bohemia), and then in the Siege of Prague, followed by duty in Bavaria and the Rhineland in 1743. Wrede, p. 154. His father died in 1752--it is unclear where--and on 25 June 1758, at the age of 14 years, Schmitt enrolled in the Imperial School of Engineering in Gumpendorf. There he received a thorough technical training in engineering, plus the education provided for officers on all other major subjects, particularly those pertaining to war and science. Jens-Florian Ebert. Heinrich von Schmitt. Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Napoleon Online. Accessed 23 January 2010. After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt received a commission as a F√§hnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw service in the last years of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) in the Bohemian theater. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. He and his mentor, Carlos Pallavicini, were at the forefront of this movement, particularly in the development of map-making.Erik Lund, War for the Every Day: Generals, Knowledge and Warfare in Early Modern Europe. Westport, Ct: Greenwood Press, 1999, , pp. 152‚Äì154. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General- Quartermaster staff. Egger, Gefecht, p. 28; Smith. Heinrich von Schmitt. Military career From 1769 to 1778, Schmitt was assigned to the military frontier, the border region of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires, and was especially active in Temesvar, in the Banat, bordering the Ottoman Empire. In 1778, he was promoted to captain and mobilized against Prussia during the short War of the Bavarian Succession, after which he transferred back to the Balkan border areas where he stayed until 1782. His thorough knowledge of the countryside guaranteed him map-making and intelligence assignments in Turkish- occupied Bosnia to gather information in preparation for an upcoming campaign. In particular, he developed material on the Ottoman military situation. His work developing intelligence of Turkish strength in Osijek and Alt Gradiska satisfied his superiors and when the war actually broke out in 1787, he was assigned to the General Staff of the Slavonion Corps. He participated in the storming of the fortress at ≈†abac, in Serbia, on 24 April 1788. Emperor Joseph II promoted him personally to major on 14 May 1788. In 1789, Schmitt fought at the Siege of Belgrade, and on 23 February 1790, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In March 1790, he transferred to Bohemia, under command of Field Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon, for anticipated action against the Kingdom of Prussia. When this war came to naught, he was transferred to the Austrian Netherlands in 1791, to help contain a local uprising. Ebert.

He distinguished himself in the defense of the pass of the Croix-aux-Bois (14 September 1792) and in the battles of Raismes and Vicoigne on 8 May 1793. On 3 September 1793, after his promotion to colonel, he served under Field Marshal Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. In the autumn of 1794, Schmitt organized the retreat of the main Imperial Army, now under the command of Coburg's successor, Feldzeugmeister Count Clerfayt, from their untenable positions in the Austrian Netherlands eastward to the Rhine. In April 1796, still serving under Field Marshal Count Clerfayt, he was appointed to the staff of Archduke Charles by Emperor Francis II. With his deputy, Anton Mayer von Heldensfeld, Schmitt planned the 1796 campaign, which, after several initial setbacks, produced the Imperial victories at the Battle of Amberg (24 August 1796) and the Battle of W√ºrzburg (2 September 1796), and resulted in the French retreat to the west shore of the Rhine. He was promoted to Generalmajor on 6 September 1796. Schmitt's tenure as chief of staff was briefly interrupted in 1799 when he was connected, by rumor at least, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed so much pressure on Schmitt that he briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff; he was never connected to the assassination and was reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant, but later in that year, Emperor Francis II replaced his brother, Archduke Charles, as commander in chief of the army. The 58-year- old Schmitt requested retirement, claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with the stress of the job, but the Emperor refused his request. The new commander, Field Marshal P√°l Kray, retained Schmitt on his staff, but he seldom agreed with Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, on any of the main issues facing the army; when Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt, Schmitt again requested retirement, which was again refused. On 19 August 1800, Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt went first to Vienna and then to Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his friend Ferdinand Ritter von Gei√ülern until 1805. Recall to active duty During the War of the Third Coalition in 1805-1806, as one Austria's most capable chiefs of staff, Schmitt was called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the challenging Austro-Russian retreat. Equipped with a glowing letter of endorsement from Emperor Francis II to the Russian Infantry General Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745‚Äì1813), Schmitt arrived at the Russian headquarters and was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. Schmitt met with the Russian forces at the great abbey of Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders developed a plan to encircle √âdouard Mortier's French force near D√ºrenstein. To do so, they drew not only on their own military experience, but also called upon a captain from the region, to use his geographic and local knowledge.Robert Goetz. 1805: Austerlitz, the Destruction of the Third Coalition. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2005, pp. 76-77. Death at D√ºrenstein In the dark and confusion at the end of the battle, Schmitt was shot by Russian musketry. In this image, Marshal Mortier directs cannon fire on the Austrian and Russian lines. √âdouard Mortier had marched from Passau and Linz toward Vienna, traveling on the north bank of the Danube. His newly created VIII Corps, known as Corps Mortier, consisted of three divisions, which were stretched apart along the river between Marbach and D√ºrenstein. This over-extension left his corps' northern flank unprotected, against Napoleon's specific instructions. Schmitt's plan capitalized on this mistake. On 11 November 1805, Kutuzov's column trapped one of Mortier's divisions, under command of Honor√© Th√©odore Maxime Gazan de la Peyri√®re. The Russians used a ruse to entice Gazan into an attack on a small force, and then trapped him between two columns. The French were surrounded at the front and rear by the Russians, caught on the flood plain at D√ºrenstein. They could neither move forward nor backward. A second French division arrived in mid-afternoon and attacked the Russians in the flank, but were themselves surprised when Schmitt led an additional Russian column out of the mountains.Goetz, p. 77. Gazan's division lost over 40 percent of its men, as well as its colors, and several guns.Digby Smith. Napoleonic Wars Databook: 1805, London: Greenhill Publishing Co., 1998, p. 213. The battle lasted well into the night. In its waning moments, the French were evacuating across the Danube in a flotilla of boats. In the confusion, Schmitt was shot, probably by Russian musketeers, in a field between the Waldstein and Heud√ºrrgraben.Smith. Heinrich von Schmitt. Wilhelm von Kotzebue, a German in Russian service, later reported that the column came through the forest road and entered the main road on the river's edge; they immediately entered the cross-fire between Pierre Dupont's French forward posts of Dragoons and the Russian troops of Dmitry Dokhturov. He fell by Wadstein, and was buried on the battlefield with the dead of his Russian column. Although his burial site has never been found, a monument for him was erected in a park in nearby Krems in 1811. Egger, Gefecht, pp. 28-29. Assessment and legacy When Napoleon's armies threatened Vienna in 1805, the Emperor called Schmitt out of retirement for the specific task of organizing the challenging Austro-Russian retreat. As Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans, frequently hampered by difficult terrain. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more so than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome‚ÄîAusterlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles‚Äîbut his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.Smith, Databook, p. 213; After the battle, Weyrother retired to Vienna, and died there a few months later. See Smith, Weyrother. Leopold Kudrna and Digby Smith (compilers). War and Peace Schmitt is mentioned in Leo Tolstoy's novel _War and Peace_ , Volume I, where several Austrian court officials and generals express grief at the news of his death at D√ºrenstein. Tolstoy has one of his characters, the diplomat Bilibin, call him \\"a general we all loved\\". Sources Citations and notes Bibliography * Ebert, Jens- Florian. Heinrich von Schmitt.

Weston) and is the head of the League of American Nationalists (LOAN), a white separatist gang who desires to gain a legitimate foothold in Charming and force SAMCRO out. Biography Season 2 Zobelle moved into Charming and presented himself to the townspeople and local law enforcement as the owner of the newly opened Impeccable Smokes cigar shop on the town's Main Street. Zobelle was introduced to Deputy Chief David Hale through Hale's older brother, Jacob, who hoped to benefit financially from Zobelle's help and the removal of SAMCRO from Charming. Zobelle presented himself as being a means to get SAMCRO out of Charming. Deputy Chief Hale, noting that he knew of Zobelle's racial beliefs, initially refused Zobelle's assistance. Simultaneously, Zobelle almost immediately tried to undermine SAMCRO's iron-fisted rule over the town and threatened dire consequences against the club if they ignored his warnings. He made it clear that his mission was to stop SAMCRO from selling guns to minority gangs and to take over their territory by trying to bring down the MC at any cost, no matter what method his gang has to use. After Clay Morrow, SAMCRO's President, refused to stop selling to minorities, Ethan had Clay's wife, Gemma Teller Morrow, brutally raped and beaten; she was instructed to tell Clay what happened and to stop his dealings with minorities or she would be assaulted again. This did not have the desired effect, as Gemma did not tell Clay of the rape. Deputy Chief Hale, determined to get SAMCRO out of Charming, starts to open himself to Zobelle's help. When Zobelle proposed that they bring in drugs to Charming to undermine the residents' confidence in SAMCRO, Hale is first angered by the idea. Undeterred, with Zobelle and LOAN's backing, Ernest Darby and the Nords began producing and selling meth. SAMCRO discovered that the Nords were selling meth and tipped Hale off to the location of Darby's meth lab. When Hale visited the lab site, he said he would come back with a warrant. However, he instead told Chief Wayne Unser that nothing was wrong. With that, Unser and Clay both knew that Hale was working with Zobelle (or, at least, turning a blind eye towards Zobelle's activities). But when Unser told Hale about Gemma's rape at the hands of Zobelle's group, and when Zobelle attempted to force Hale into action by giving him a disc containing a video of Ernest Darby seemingly handing Hale a bribe (actually an envelope with a coupon to Impeccable Smokes), Hale changed his mind about accepting Zobelle's help. Throughout Season two, Zobelle and his henchman made several more attempts to remove SAMCRO from Charming, but all were relatively unsuccessful. Zobelle's dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with SAMCRO came to an end when the bikers were able to convince A.J. Weston that Zobelle was working behind the brotherhood's back by dealing in the gun and heroin trades with the Mayans. Weston killed high-ranking LOAN member Ule, and assaulted and threatened Zobelle, but ended up being arrested for the arson attack on SAMCRO's pornography studio. With the help of Chief Unser, SAMCRO used the moment of confusion to corner the LOAN leader and his daughter in their cigar shop. Before Clay could execute Zobelle, Hale and other officers showed up at the scene. To avoid impending death, Zobelle revealed a heroin stash and told the officers that he and his daughter were drug dealers and the two were arrested before the bikers could do anything. In the Season two finale, it was revealed that Zobelle was a long-time F.B.I. informant, so he and his daughter were set free. With protection provided by the Mayans, Zobelle was escorted to his cigar shop where he and his daughter waited for an opportunity to flee Charming to avoid SAMCRO's wrath. They made a plan to return \\"home\\" to Budapest, but first Polly left to say goodbye to Edmond Hayes. When she didn't return, Zobelle reluctantly left her behind. SAMCRO ambushed the Mayan convoy, but Zobelle escaped, seeking refuge in a gas station's store/deli, which happened to be occupied by school children. He attempted to call Hale for assistance, but Hale ultimately brushed him off, and merely informed him of Polly's death with no sympathy. Zobelle's life was miraculously spared when a more urgent issue, that of Jax's son being kidnapped, caused the Sons to depart in haste. He escaped and was last seen booking a flight out of a small private airport.

The proposed state corresponds to the eastern 11 districts of the state of Maharashtra. It makes up for 31% of area and 21% of population of the present state of Maharashtra.The area is covered by thick tropical forests and is surplus in electricity, minerals, rice and cotton.  Statehood demand  The Vidarbha region is a centrally located area in India and forms eastern part of Maharashtra state. The demand for a separate state of Vidarbha was raised for the first time over 100 years ago. As a result of which, the Central Provinces legislature passed a unanimous resolution to create a separate state of 'Mahavidarbha' on 1 October 1938 at Nagpur. This was much before the demand for a \\"Samyukta Maharashtra\\" was even conceived.http://www.epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/6166.pdf After merger with the new state of Maharashtra, the demand of separate statehood was raised time and again, with an economic view, quoting the increasing developmental backlog.  State Reorganization Commission  The Government of India appointed the first State Reorganisation Committee (SRC) under Chairmanship of Fazal Ali on 29 December 1953. Vidarbhite leaders at that time, like M S Aney and Brijlal Biyani, submitted a memorandum to State Reorganisation Commission (SRC) for a separate Vidarbha State. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had also favoured a \\"One state - One language\\" principle for reorganisation of states, he was against \\"one language - one state\\" policy. Accordingly, he submitted his views about forming at least 2 separate states of Marathi-speaking people, instead of a single large state of Maharashtra. He thought one state should have one language but at the same time, there can be two or more separate states of one language, depending upon the need for efficient administration. He had clearly favoured \\"Vidarbha State\\" with Nagpur as capital, saying, \\"Single government can not administer such a huge state as United Maharashtra.\\" \\"Thoughts on linguistic states\\", ambedkar.org, retrieved on 15 May 2016. The Fazal Ali SRC, after considering these memoranda and all other related aspects, favoured a separate Vidarbha State with Nagpur as capital in the year 1956. But Vidarbha was made part of the new state of Maharashtra in 1960 by the central government, favouring the \\"One language - One state\\" principle.  Nagpur Pact  The 1953 Nagpur Pact assures equitable development of all the regions of the proposed Marathi State. Most prominent clause of the Nagpur Pact was: one session of Maharashtra state assembly in Nagpur city every year, with minimum six weeks duration, to discuss issues exclusively related to Vidarbha. The signatories to the pact in 1953 were: * Yashwantrao Chavan, then Minister in Morarji Desai ministry of Bombay State * Ramrao Krishnarao Patil, Gandhian, Ex ICS Officer and member of first Planning Commission of India.http://news.oneindia.in/2007/05/15/r-k-patil-to-be- conferred-with-maharashtra-bhushan-award-1179233022.html ‡§ß‡§®‡§Ç‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§ó‡§æ‡§°‡§ó‡•Ä‡§≥ ‡§µ ‡§™‡•ã‡§§‡§¶‡§∞ , ‡§¶‡§æ.‡§µ‡•Ä. ‡§ó‡•ã‡§ñ‡§≤‡•á, ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§π‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•Ä.  Merger with Maharashtra  On 1 May 1960, the Vidarbha state was merged with a newly formed Maharashtra State, under the agreement known as Nagpur Pact. At that time Nagpur city lost the state capital status. Nagpur thus became the only city in independent India, which lost \\"state capital status\\" after historically being a capital of the biggest state of India (by area) for more than 100 years.  Post merger developments  After the merger, winter assembly session is being held regularly at Nagpur. Contrary to the provisions of \\"Nagpur Pact\\", the session is never held for complete six weeks. Moreover, although session is supposed to discuss exclusively issues related to Vidarbha, it is conducted like any other Maharashtra state assembly session, discussing all issues. The Vidarbha region under new Maharashtra state allegedly continued to suffer in development, giving impetus to the renewed demand of more equitable development of all regions of Maharashtra. Under these circumstances, the Maharashtra Government appointed a committee, to study regional imbalances in Maharashtra. The committee found that: : \\"The failure to report to the state assembly every year in terms of the Nagpur Agreement, has been a serious lapse on the part of the state Government. If a report had been made to state legislature, as per the Nagpur Agreement, the matter would have received sustained attention. In the circumstances this did not happen.\\"GoM(1985):Report of the Fact Finding Committee on Regional Imbalance in Maharashtra, Planning Department, Mumbai.

It provides a sympathetic portrait of a man whom the British portrayed as a great villain, and is based on historical sources as far as possible. The book is written as an autobiography in which Nana Saheb describes his life in his own words. Plot Nana Saheb was the adopted son of Bajirao II, the last Maratha Peshwa, and heir to his position as \\"prime minister\\" of the Maratha lands. He is raised in an immensely wealthy family and educated as a Brahmin and a prince, although his father's power had been taken away by the British. On his father's death the British do not recognize his title, but allow him to continue in his comfortable exile in the town of Bithoor. An urbane and sophisticated man, Nana Saheb is sympathetic to the British, several of whom are his close friends, but cannot accept their right to rule and exploit India. When the mutiny breaks out in May 1857, Nana Sahib finds himself forced to accept a position of leadership. After a long and ultimately futile struggle in which both sides commit many atrocities, Nana Sahib flees to Nepal where he receives a grudging sanctuary, taking with him an English woman he has rescued and with whom he has fallen in love. Many years later, he revisits India and then travels on to safety in Istanbul, the place where he sets down his memoirs. Major themes The Devil's Wind is a painstaking literary work that blends beautifully the artist and the historian. The book is both an epic and an autobiography. Malgonkar's purpose is to rehabilitate Nana Saheb, maligned as a monster by British propaganda, by telling the story from the Indian point of view in Nana Saheb own words. Malgonkar's Nana Sahib is an affectionate, soft-hearted, generous and cultivated nobleman, free from prejudice and governed by common sense and reason. With skill and reticence, Malgomkar reconstructs the picture of India, with Kanpur as its microcosm, growing suspicious, aggrieved, alienated, hostile, rebellious, enraged and vengeful by degrees. He presents a convincing picture of the Indian reaction to British provocations, describes their hesitance and disunity at the time of the early \\"rebel\\" victories, and their growing determination mingled with despair as the tide turns against them. Nana Saheb inherits from his adoptive father a delight in sex, and this theme recurs throughout the book. Malgonkar treats the women in his book sympathetically, and grants their right to sexual choice. The book gives a powerful portrayal of Kashi, Nana Sahib's third wife, who remains a virgin while with him because of his fear of a curse that says if he consummates a marriage the wife shall die, which had happened with his first two wives. Later, Kashi gains her freedom to love as she chooses in the court of Nepal. Publication history *1972, UK, Hamish Hamilton , Hardcover *1972, USA, Viking Press , Hardcover *1988, UK, Penguin Books , Paperback Explanation of the novel's title \\"The Devils Wind\\" is the name the sepoys gave to the mutiny, a barbaric, uncontrollable fury that swept across the hot plains of India as if blown by the Devil. It is another name for the Loo, the hot dry and gritty wind that blows in the plains of India before the monsoons bring relief. The protagonist's uncle was murdered by his own relatives for acquiring the throne. He haunts the subsequent rulers of the Maratha kingdom. Nanasaheb's predicament is this devil's wind and that explains the title, Devil's Wind. Literary significance and reception P.P. Mehta in Indo-Anglian Fiction: An Assessment, described the book as \\"the first perfect historical novel of Indo-Anglian fiction.\\" Dinesh Chandra Kumar notes that Malgonkar's moral views are deftly woven into the texture of his novels, sometimes expressed in a subtle way that is not perceivable by common eyes and minds. J.Y. Dayananda points out that Malgonkar \\"does not deal with the social and political realities of India but only with the social and political thinking of a small property-owning conservative class in India\\". However, Dayananda believes that The Devil's Wind is the \\"most profound fictional treatment of the rebellion of 1857 from an Indian point of view\\". Reviewing the 1972 Edition, Books of The Times, USA wrote 'interesting, intriguing, very humane, convincing...Has the touch of Kipling genius for story telling' Illustrated London News wrote 'Manohar Malgonkar is a master of English prose' References Category:1972 novels Category:Historical novels Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:1972 Indian novels ","title":"The Devil's Wind"},{"id":"26093191","text":"Rockchapel GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the village of Rockchapel in the North West of County Cork, Ireland which forms part of the parish of Rockchapel and Meelin. The village is located close to border with County Kerry and County Limerick. The club plays Gaelic Football in the Duhallow division competitions. Ladies' Gaelic football is also played within the club. Rockchapel juvenile footballers play with St. Peter's which is an amalgamation of Meelin, Freemount and Rockchapel clubs at juvenile level. They last won the Duhallow Football Championship in 2012 and won the Cork County Junior Football Championship later that year. Football Early years Gaelic football began in a townland called Rockchapel in the 1920s. A priest named Father Hurley, the nephew of the renowned Father Casey from Abbeyfeale, were there at the beginning. Games were organised between Rockchapel, Meelin, Brosna and Mountcollins as there was no structure or Board in place at that time. 21 years after the Duhallow Board was first formed Rockchapel had its first victory when they defeated Kilbrin in the novice final in 1954 which was played in Banteer. The team was captained by Tom Murphy of Lyreneague and the panel of players included PJ Morrissey, M Nelligan, C Murphy, J Guiney, Denise JD O'Mahony, D O'Connell, Fr. T Murphy, C O'Carroll, D O'Mahony, D Sheehan, D O'Keeffe, B Guiney, Donie O'Connell, J Carroll, J Moyles and JJ Curtin. Playing in the junior ranks from 1955 to 1957 brought no success so the club re-graded to Novice in 1958. The following year the novice championship was won for the second time, defeating Castlemagner in the final. The 1960s After competing in the junior grade in 1960 and 1961, the Club again re-graded to Novice in 1962. In an amazing sequence Rockchapel lost in the Novice finals of 1962 ‚Äì 1965 inclusive. There was some compensation when the Novice Football League was won in 1964 and 1965. Of the team which beat Ballydesmond by 2‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì3 in the 1965 decider, there were 3 priests in the defence, namely Fr. Finbarr Kelleher at left corner back, Fr. Tom Murphy centre back and Fr. Padraig Keogh at left half back. Rockchapel also won the Novice Football League of 1967 but the final was not played until May 1968 owing to the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease. In the final Rockchapel defeated Lyre 2‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì5. The 1970s After losing the 1970 Novice Football League final to Banshee Rovers by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì6, Rockchapel bounced back in the Novice Championship. Ballydaly were defeated by 2‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì2 in the semi-final, to set up a meeting with Lyre in the final after drawing 6 points each on the first occasion both teams returned to Banteer and Rockchapel won by 1‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì2. Since 1971 the Club has been contesting the Junior Football Championship and after waiting 5 years the Junior Football Championship was won for the first time ever. After defeating Newmarket in the first round, Knocknagree were defeated by 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì2 and Kiskeam in the semi-final by 1‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì5. The final, which was played in Kiskeam on the first Sunday of October, was a rip roaring contest of swaying fortunes which Rockchapel won by 2‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì5 against Ballydesmond. In 1977 Knocknagree defeated Rockchapel in the Examiner Cup final by 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì4. In defending the Junior Football Championship, they defeated Newmarket in the first Round and Dromtariffe in the semi-final. In the final, played in Newmarket, they defeated Knocknagree by 1‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì2. In the county Championship they were victorious over Brian Dillon's in the first round by 0‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì5. In the semi-final at Buttevant, the North Cork Champions Grange were defeated by 1‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì4. The club's first County Final appearance was against Castletownbere which Rockchapel lost by 3‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì8 in Macroom. The 1980s and early 1990s In 1985 the Junior Championship was won when Kiskeam were defeated in the Final played in Boherbue. This was followed with victory in the 1986 Examiner Cup final when we defeated Kanturk 1‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì7. 1987 will be remembered for a long time in Rockchapel. After victories over Boherbue, Newmarket and Kiskeam in the Championship, Rockchapel qualified for the final against Kanturk which was played in Dromtariffe on 27 September. Rockchapel scored 2‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì8 to win the Duhallow title for the 5th time in their history. In the County Championship they defeated Kilmichael and Urhan before Rockchapel came to face Carbery Rangers in the County Junior Football final played in Inchigeela on 29 November. After a close match, Rockchapel were victorious 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì4. In 1988, their first year in the Intermediate football championship, they reached the semi-final of the league and were defeated by the eventual champions Kilshannig in the semi-final of the championship. In 1989 the Club created history by winning the Intermediate Football Championship and League finals, with the team captained by Joe Carroll and trained by Pat Curtin, with selectors Den O'Mahony and Seanie Piggott. On winning the Intermediate Football Championship we defeated Fermoy by 3 points at Buttevant, Nemo Rangers by a point at Mourneabbey and accounted for Naomh Ab√°n by 3 points in Dromtariffe at the semi-final and Mallow after a replay in the final. In 1990 the team competed in the Senior ranks, losing to Carrigdhoun. The club re-graded to intermediate in 1991 and re-graded to Junior grade in 1993. Mid to Late 1990s and 2000s In 1996 Rockchapel won the Examiner Cup and the club's next big success was the Duhallow Junior football championship in 2001 defeating Boherbue in the final. The same year Rockchapel were knocked out of the County Championship at the quarter final stage by Imokilly Champions Cloyne Rockchapel have won the Duhallow Junior A Football Championship 7 times in total.

Before the final, ructions occurred when the \\"Rock\\" selectors realised they couldn't play St.Peters underage star Patrick \\"Spud\\" Collins as he was still under 16. \\"Spud\\" Collins became disillusioned with the whole affair and announced his retirement from the game. He was later brought out of retirement for the lure of Intermediate football and the promise of 10 pint bottles in Paddy Molly's after every game. Both games were tense tight affairs and it was only a kick of a ball that separated both teams after 2 hours of Football. The path to the county final saw wins against Tadhg McCarthaigh's GAA, of Caheragh West Cork, in the quarter final and against Glenbower Rovers Killeagh (East Cork) in the semi-final. After winning the county 'the Rock' represented Cork in Munster losing out to Kenmare Shamrocks of Kerry in the Munster Semi-final. Intermediate 2013 saw Rockchapel back competing at the Intermediate grade after winning the Junior County in 2012. A first round loss to Fermoy was followed up by Victories over Glanmire, Cloyne and √âire √ìg to set up a Semi-final meeting with Grenagh. 'The Rock' lost the semi-final to eventual champions Grenagh. 2014 saw 'The Rock' go one step further and reach the Intermediate County final losing out to √âire Og. They reached the final with wins over Mayfield, Kinsale and Cill na Martra. 2015 was a disappointing year for the team who exited the championship after a 2nd round defeat at the hands of Mayfield after a comprehensive victory over Youghal in the first round In the 2016 campaign Rockchapel lost the county final to Bandon. After a blistering start that saw Rockchapel lead 1‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì4 at half time, Bandon gained a foothold in the second half and scored the decisive goal with 10 minutes to go, from there they never looked like losing the game that ended on a scoreline of 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì7 in favour of the west cork men. Rockchapel's path to the final saw victories over Youghal, Glanworth, Aghabullogue and Millstreet. Ladies football The Rockchapel ladies team won the All-Ireland ladies Junior club final in 1999, beating St.Nathy's from Sligo in Lusmagh, Co. Offaly.

Other characters on the show included Pete's dog Wembley, and his computer Scooter. Overall, 404 episodes were produced. The show was unique in that it was never scripted. Castriota and Ensminger would meet a few days before taping (which usually occurred on Tuesdays) to rough out the shows segments. The show was filmed before a live studio audience, usually consisting of Boy Scouts troops, Girl Scouts troops, or other groups of children from the area. Each episode featured several segments, typically including an educational segment about science and a segment with a cartoon shown on Scooter's screen (such as The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show). During the later years, the show would air Sunday mornings. Most of these are believed to be reruns.

Michael Poulin Evolution of principles of Service Orientation, part 1.Date accessed: 12 April 2010. * Standardized service contract * Service loose coupling * Service abstraction * Service reusability * Service autonomy * Service statelessness * Service discoverability * Service composability It is the application of these design principles that create technology independent services and hence provide interoperability in the long term.David Webber.Services as Web Services: \\"Are We There Yet?\\"How Web Service Technology Stacks Alone Cannot Fulfill the Goals of SOA.Date Accessed: 11 April 2010. These design principles serve as a guideline for identifying services. Strategic goals The application of these principles helps in attaining the underlying goals linked with the adoption of service-orientation in the first place. These goals are strategic in nature i.e. long term and look beyond the immediate needsThe immediate needs are those that are linked with automating a particular business process e.g. invoice processing while long-term requirements are those that look beyond the current requirements and are usually spread across multiple business processes of an organization. These strategic objectives could be summarized into the following seven goals & benefits:SOA Goals & Benefits Sadi Melbouci.Methodology to Deliver Service Oriented Architecture.Date Accessed: 10 April 2010. * Increased intrinsic interoperability * Increased federation * Increased vendor diversification options * Increased business and technology alignment * Increased ROI * Increased organizational agility * Reduced IT burden Each of the above goals and benefits directly helps towards developing an agile organizationAn agile organization within the context of IT world is one that can quickly respond to its business requirements while using much of its existing resources. that can quickly respond to the ever-changing market conditions with reduced efforts and time. Characteristics The service-orientation design principles help in distinguishing a service-oriented solutionA solution that is based on service-orientation design paradigm and is made up of services. from a traditional object-oriented solution by promoting distinct design characteristics. The presence of these characteristics in a service-oriented solution greatly improves the chances of realizing the aforementioned goals and benefits. Erl has identified four service-orientation characteristics as follows:Erl et al, (2009).\\"SOA Design Patterns\\". Prentice Hall. * Vendor- neutral * Business-driven * Enterprise-centric * Composition-centric A vendor- neutral service-oriented solution helps to evolve the underlying technology architecture in response to ever changing business requirements. By not being dependent on a particular vendor, any aging infrastructure could be replaced by more efficient technologies without the need for redesigning the whole solution from scratch. This also helps in creating a heterogeneous technology environment where particular business automation requirements are fulfilled by specific technologies. Within a SOA, the development of solution logic is driven by the needs of the business and is designed in a manner that focuses on the long-term requirements of the business. As a result, the technology architecture is more aligned with the business needs. Unlike traditional silo- based application development, a SOA takes into account the requirements of either the whole of the enterprise or at least some considerable part of it. As a result, the developed services are interoperable and reusable across the different segments of the enterprise. A service-oriented solution enables to deal with new and changing requirements, within a reduced amount of time, by making use of existing services. The services are designed in a manner so that they can be recomposed i.e. become a part of different solutions. Application The service-orientation design principles are applied during the service-oriented analysis and design process. The extent to which each of these principles could be applied is always relative and needs to be weighed against the overall goals and objectives of an organization as well as the time constraints. One important factor that needs to be kept in mind is that it is not just the application of these design principles alone but the consistent application that guarantees the realization of the service- orientation design goals linked with the adoption of service-orientation. This is because services are an enterprise resource, i.e. giving the confidence that they conform to certain standards and could be reused within multiple solutions, so in order to remain such a resource, they must emerge from a process to which these principles have been applied consistently, as an inconsistent application would result in services that are not compatible with each other, resulting in loss of the fundamental service-orientation design characteristics.

Back of house with barn door (right) and stable door (left) Roof design of an East Frisian Gulf house from inside, seen from the threshing floor (Tenne) Farm labourer's house at the Cloppenburg Museum Village A Gulf house (), also called a Gulf farmhouse (Gulfhof) or East Frisian house (Ostfriesenhaus), is a type of farmhouse (sometimes called a housebarn in North America) that emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries in North Germany.Vollmer, Manfred et al., Landscape and Cultural Heritage in the Wadden Sea Region, Wadden Sea Ecosystem No. 12 - 2001, CWSS, Wilhelmshaven, 2001. ISSN 0946-896X. It is timber-framed and built using post-and-beam construction. Initially Gulf houses appeared in the marshes, but later spread to the Frisian geest. They were distributed across the North Sea coastal regions from West Flanders through the Netherlands, East Frisia and Oldenburg as far as Schleswig-Holstein (as a variant called the Haubarg). This spread was interrupted by the Elbe-Weser Triangle which developed a type of Low German house instead, better known as the Low Saxon house.  Emergence  The Gulf house owes its emergence to economic circumstances. Before its invention the folk of the East Frisian North Sea marshes lived in Old Frisian farmhouses (Altfriesischer Bauernhaus or oud-Friese boerenhuis), a type of unit farmstead (Wohnstallhaus). These small buildings had enough space for the farmers because they did not have to store large harvests. Cereal farming was only possible on a few higher-lying areas, whilst the poorly drained marshes were only suitable as grassland and pastureland. As drainage technology improved with the use of windmills and watermills the fertile marshy areas could be dried out and used extensively for grain farming. In order to store the growing quantities of harvest a house with greater capacity was needed, which is how the Gulf house came into being.  Design  The typical Gulf house consisted of a living space (f√∂√∂er√§en) and an adjoining working area (achter√§en) with stable and barn. By extending the roof downwards in the rear part of the house, side bays (Abseiten) were created, the so-called ≈´tk√ºbben, so that the barn area became wider than the living area. The centre of the stable and barn section formed the Gulf, a storage area for hay, harvest products and tools, which gave this type of house its name. In one of the side bays were compartments or stalls for keeping cattle (kaust√¢l). The walkway running in front of them was called the kaug√¢ng (\\"cow passage\\"). At the far end there was traditionally the privy (gemak). At the gable end of the working area were two doors: a large barn door (sƒü√ºerd√∂√∂er) on one side, that gave access for wagons to the threshing floor (d√∂sd√™l) and the Gulf, and a small, double door (messeld√∂√∂er) on the other side. The latter derived its name because it was the door through which cattle dung was carried from the kaug√¢ng (dung = m√§ers; remove dung = messen). There was often a semi-circular window in a metal frame over the large barn door which was designed in the form of a stylised rising sun. The front part of the middle section, at the gable end, in which the horse stable (p√™rst√¢l) was housed, was surrounded by a dividing wall and was given a cover, so that an additional floor (a so-called hiel, plural: hillen) was created on which extra hay for winter feeding was stored. The weight of the roof was not carried by the outside walls on this type of building, but by an internal group of posts and beams (St√§nderwerk or st√•√•pelw√¢rk). The roof covering of the living area was traditionally made entirely of red clay tiles. By contrast, the lower one-third of the barn roof was covered with tiles, but the upper two-thirds were thatched. The roof was usually in the shape of a half-hipped roof. Where only one end was half-hipped this was the wind-facing gable end (usually the barn gable). The hip is often surmounted, even today, by a decorative staff or Malljan, a device that echoes the mystical beliefs of earlier times. One feature of many older Gulf farmhouses is the so-called Upkammer (upk√•√•mer), a room in the living quarters, that is higher than the rest of the rooms because it sits above a half-sunken cellar. This can often be recognised from the outside of such buildings by the window arrangement. The Gulf house structure is found, albeit sometimes with major or situation-specific modifications such as a side entrance, both on large farm buildings (pl√•√•ts) as well as on smaller buildings including farm labourers' houses.  Other uses  Conversion: A bank in a former Gulf farmhouse in Hollen The restructuring of agriculture and the closure of farms has provided opportunities for Gulf farmhouses to be used for other rural purposes. For example, in Loquard (municipality of Krummh√∂rn, Aurich district) a former Gulf farmhouse has been converted into a primary school. In Hollen (municipality of Uplengen, Leer district) the local Sparkasse bank has moved into a former Gulf farmhouse.

He is regarded as one of the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century whose works are directly connected with Romanticism and Realism. Born in the small town of Pogradec on the Lake of Ohrid in Ottoman-occupied Albania, he completed his primary and secondary education in Monastir and Athens, and thus received his academic education at the universities of Bucharest and Graz. He developed and maintained close liaison with Asdreni, Ernest Koliqi, Gjergj Fishta and Mitrush Kuteli who all of them became among the most outstanding Albanian writers of that time. Poradeci is best remembered for his poetry collections Vallja e yjve and Ylli i zemr√´s inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of Albanian life. His style is characterised for its stylistic and technical achievement, its form and content as well as its engagement with nature, eroticism and philosophy. He notably translated several major English, French, German, Italian and Russian works into the Albanian language.  Biography   Life and career  Lasgush Poradeci was born on 27 December 1899 into an Albanian family in the town of Pogradec at the western coast of the Lake of Ohrid in what was then part of the Ottoman Empire and is now Albania. In his native town he properly received his primary formal education at a primary school and attended a Romanian school in Monastir upon his completion from 1906 to 1916. During the First World War, Poradeci's father, despite the tenuous relations between Albanians and Greeks in southeastern Albania at that time, directed him to Greece to continue his education, on the condition that he won't study at a Greek institution. He therefore attended the French Lyc√©e L√©onin in Athens until 1920. In Athens, he spent his last two years in a sanatorium due to health reasons to which, despite his desperate financial situation, he was referred with the assistance of Sophia Schliemann. Although not completely recovered, Poradeci migrated to Bucharest after one year and rejoined his brother. In Bucharest, he enrolled at the University of Arts and entered the Albanian association for the Albanian diaspora of Romania later being elected its secretary. It was in the city that he met his fellows Asdreni, Mitrush Kuteli and numerous other Romanian poets and writers. In 1924, Fan Noli awarded Poradeci a scholarship to continue his higher education abroad. He immediately left for Berlin, where he hoped to study under Albanologist Norbert Jokl, and continued on to the University of Graz whereas he attended the Faculty of Romano-German philology and finished a doctorate there in 1933. A statue dedicated to Lasgush Poradeci in Pogradec on the Lake of Ohrid. Poradeci voluntarily returned to Albania the following year to teach arts at a secondary school in Tirana. From 1944 to 1947, he subsequently became unemployed within a period characterised by the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the Communism in Albania. He lived with his wife in Tirana on the latter‚Äôs meagre salary as a teacher. After brief employment at the Institute of Science, forerunner of the University of Tirana, he translated literature for the state-owned Naim Frash√´ri publishing company until his retirement in 1974. He died in poverty at his home in Tirana on 12 November 1987.\\"Albanian Literature in Translation\\" Lasgush Poradeci biography by Robert Elsie. Retrieved 1 April 2011  Writings and publications  Lasgush Poradeci was undoubtedly fascinated by the aesthetics of nature. Visible in his poem Poradeci, he admired the environment of his beloved hometown Pogradec at the Lake of Ohrid which never ceased to fascinate and enchant him. His poetic creations are based on the four elements, earth, water, air and fire, which are the essential themes in his poetry. He further divided poetry between landscape poems, love poems and philosophical poems while all his poems are essentially meditative-philosophical. He composed two extraordinary collections of poetry including Vallja e yjve and Ylli i zemr√´s both published in Romania in 1933 and 1937 respectively. His poetry is far away from being Romantic and engaging compared to the poetry of the Albanian Renaissance. It is characterised by deep thoughts, labyrinthine feelings and powerful universal ideas. During the same period, he contributed verses to the Albanian weekly newspaper Shqip√´ri' e re (New Albania). Other Poradeci works include \\"The theological excursion of Socrates\\", \\"About to\\", \\"Kamadeva\\", \\"Ballads of Muharrem\\" and \\"Reshit Collaku\\". The entire work that Lasgush Poradeci made was all about Pogradec, his birthplace. Poradeci's complete works were published in 1989. Poradeci has been also active in translating several notable international literary works into the Albanian language.

Background and early career  It is not known when Wang Shi was born. His biographies in the official histories of Tang Dynasty ‚Äî the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang ‚Äî differ as to who his father was, with the Old Book of Tang indicating that his father was the chancellor Wang BoOld Book of Tang, vol. 164. and the New Book of Tang indicating that his father was Wang Bo's brother Wang Qi (), who also had a lengthy career as an imperial official.New Book of Tang, vol. 167. Because of his heritage, Wang Shi was made a scribe for the Crown Prince,As it is not known when this occurred, it is not known which crown prince Wang served under. and he later passed, in 828, during the reign of Emperor Wenzong, a special imperial examination for those who are considered wise and righteous.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. He was later made an imperial censor with the title Dianzhong Shiyushi (). He was considered frugal in his youth. However, in the middle of Emperor Wenzong's Taihe era (827-835), Wang, who was considered ambitious, tried to achieve greater offices by associating with the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng and Wang Shoucheng's associate Zheng Zhu, and when the deputy chief imperial censor Gui Rong () submitted an accusation against him on that basis, he was sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the deputy mayor of Jiangling. During the Dazong era (847-860) of Emperor Wenzong's uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong, Wang Shi served as the prefect of Jin Prefecture (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). At that time, there was a major famine in the Yellow River bend area (i.e., modern northern Shaanxi and central-western Inner Mongolia), and the refugees spread throughout the region. Few prefectures welcomed the refugees, but Wang did, and it was said that several thousands were saved because of his actions. The non-Han tribes of the region also suffered from the famine and were pillaging the cities, but after hearing that Wang was defending Jin Prefecture carefully, avoided attacking Jin Prefecture.  Campaign for control of Annan  Some time prior to 858, however, Wang Shi was no longer in an active position ‚Äî rather, he was nominally the teacher for Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Li Men (), but was holding his office at the eastern capital Luoyang. In 858, he was made the commandant and commander of the military of Annan District (ÂÆâÂçó, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam). At that time, Annan had been under repeated Nanzhao attacks because the abusive rule of a prior commandant, Li Zhuo (), had led the natives of the region to encourage Nanzhao incursions. After Wang's arrival in Annan, he built wooden defenses for the city, such that he was able to fend off Nanzhao incursions.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Wang also had to deal with his own mutinous subordinates. One of the officers, Luo Xinggong (), had amassed 2,000 elite soldiers under his own command, while the commandant's own troops were far weaker and only numbered about 600. Luo thus was resistant to the commandants' orders. After Wang's arrival, Wang had Luo caned and exiled. Later in the year, a group of soldiers, who were fearful that they would be attacked by Tang troops from Rong District (ÂÆπÁÆ°, headquartered in modern Yulin, Guangxi), had Wang's headquarters surrounded, demanding that he leave and return to the north, so that they could use the city to defend against a Rong District attack. Wang refused and rebuked them, and they fled. He later arrested and executed them. Wang further used various tricks to cause a dissension among the locally-prominent Du family, which had long resisted the rule of the commandants of Annan, causing the leader of the Dus, Du Shoucheng (), to flee and die in flight. It was said that for six straight years prior to Wang's arrival, Annan had not paid tributes or taxes to the imperial government, nor had any rewards been given to soldiers, and that it was Wang who resumed these things after pacifying the region. Further, as a result, the neighboring kingdoms of Champa and Chenla resumed their tributary relationships with Tang.  Campaign against Qiu Fu  As of 860, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Emperor Yizong, Wang Shi was no longer the commandant of Annan. By that point, an agrarian rebellion led by Qiu Fu had overrun Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), and the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Zhedong, Zheng Zhide (), was unable to put down the rebellion. Under the recommendation of the chancellor Xiahou Zi, Emperor Yizong made Wang the governor of Zhedong to succeed Zheng. When meeting with Emperor Yizong, Wang requested a large number of troops ‚Äî and a eunuch accompanying the emperor opposed on the basis of the high expense. Wang, however, justified his request by pointing out that the Yangtze River- Huai River region was the main tax base for the empire, and that a failure in suppressing Qiu's rebellion would cost the imperial government far more than the expenses of a successful campaign. Emperor Yizong agreed and mobilized troops from Zhongwu (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), Yicheng (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), and Huainan (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) Circuits to serve under Wang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. Once Wang arrived at Zhedong, he supplemented his troops by recruiting ethnic Huigu and Tufan exiles who had been settled in the region to join his army, to improve the mobility of his troops as the Huigu and Tufan exiles were capable riders. He divided his troops into two groups and attacked Qiu in two prongs. In doing so, he used some tactics that surprised the experienced officers of his army: * Despite the needs of the army, he ordered that all of the counties in the region still under government control to open their food storages and distribute food to the people. (He later justified this as pointing out that Qiu's followers had been motivated by hunger, as the region had suffered from a famine, and that distributing the food would prevent more people from joining Qiu ‚Äî and further, as the counties were largely defenseless, if Qiu attacked, the food would fall into Qiu's hands.) * He established no fire beacon posts for communication between the troops. (He later justified this by pointing out that the purpose of the beacon posts was to sound an alarm and seek reinforcements. As he was using all of his troops in attacking Qiu, there would be no reinforcements available, and the fires would merely serve to alarm the populace.) * He sent the most cowardly soldiers to serve as forward scouts. (He later justified this by pointing out that if he had sent the most brave soldiers, those soldiers might prematurely engage the enemy, and therefore, if they were then killed in the engagements, he would receive no intelligence information.) After Wang's army defeated Qiu's in several battles, Qiu fled to Shan (Ââ°, in modern Shaoxing). Wang put Shan under siege, and Qiu subsequently surrendered. Wang executed some 20 commandes under Qiu, and delivered Qiu to Chang'an, where Qiu was executed.  Suppression of Wuning soldiers  In 862, the elite Yindao (ÈäÄÂàÄ, \\"silver sword\\") soldiers at Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) mutinied and expelled the military governor (Jiedushi) Wen Zhang (). Emperor Yizong made Wang Shi the military governor of Wuning and ordered that he take the Zhongwu and Yicheng troops that had served under him during the campaign against Qiu, who were still at Zhedong at the time, to Wuning with him. The Yindao soldiers, hearing this, became fearful. Three days after Wang's arrival, he announced that a grand feast would be held for the Zhongwu and Yicheng troops to send them off. The Yindao soldiers also attended the feast. During the feast, he had the Zhongwu and Yicheng soldiers surround them and slaughter them, killing several thousands. Subsequently, Emperor Yizong ordered that Wuning Circuit be disbanded, with its territory divided between Huainan, Yanhai (ÂÖóÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) Circuits, and a newly created Susi (ÂÆøÊ≥ó, headquartered in modern Suzhou, Anhui) Circuit. Wang was put in charge of the operation to distribute the Wuning soldiers to those circuits. After the task was complete, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as a general of the imperial guards, a post that he served at until death. It is not known when he died.

It is a unique example for its time of a defensive enclosure around a village. Conceived after the defeat of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the fort was located away from the main combat zone of World War I and has remained almost intact. The fort's preservation association has been at work since 1961 to restore and interpret the site. It has been included in the Inventory of Historic Sites and has been designated as a preserved natural area. The S√©r√© de Rivi√®res was a response to the increasing power of explosive artillery, abandoning vertical masonry walls for more blended fortifications that served as artillery emplacements, defended by machine guns and small arms. The forts and batteries were designed to provide mutual support and to provide shelter and support for infantry units to maintain a defensive line, or cover for the assembly of larger offensive forces. In the 1880s, with the development of high explosives, much of the masonry construction of the forts became obsolete and was rebuilt using concrete and earth coverage.  History  Artillery direction observatory Fort Villey-le-Sec was built between 1875 and 1879, then modernized in 1888, 1903 and 1914.  Construction  The fortified camp of Toul anchors the end of the fortification curtain of the Hauts de Meuse. The 1874 Declaration of Public Utility that authorized construction envisioned four forts: Ecouvres, Dongermain, St.-Michel and Villey-le-Sec. Villey-le-Sec was planned to protect the southwestern approach to Toul, located on the plateau of Haye, supported on the south by the bluffs along the Moselle. The fort was originally planned to be about further west, where the Chaudeney redoubt is located. The fort was responsible for the exits from the Forest of Haye, and to provide flanking support to the Fort de Gondreville and Fort de Chanot. Design began 5 December 1873 and construction 26 July 1875. The work was carried out by Morel, and took four years with hundreds of workers. It was the most expensive fort of the region. In 1885 the development of high-explosive shells made stone fortifications obsolete. It became necessary to reinforce the Fort de Villey- le-Sec with concrete and metal armor. At the same time the fort's artillery was judged to be vulnerable and was dispersed across the plateau. In 1890 four barracks were built of concrete, as well as a redan and two batteries in the redoubt. About 1900 a firing range was created with the fort at Gondreville in the edge of the Forest of Haye, to test the fort's weapons. Another, in the Bois de l'Embanie, was used as a training area for s In 1912 work began to equip the fort with a battery of two Mougin turrets with 155mm guns. This was interrupted by the First World War.  First World War  The military railway near the fort At the beginning of the war, after the French defeat at Morhange, the German troops moved rapidly to the west. From mid-September, after the Battle of Grand Couronn√© at Nancy, the front was stabilized within a few tens of kilometers along an axis Saint-Mihiel - Pont-√†-Mousson - Nomeny - Moncel-on-Pail - Arracourt. It will more hardly move in this sector. The population was evacuated, leaving only the garrison and the men who were essential to work the farms.  After the war  After the recovery of the Alsace-Moselle region, the fort lost its strategic interest. The army installed a small garrison, but was concerned with little more than maintenance. During the Second World War the fort's metal was stripped by the German army for scrap. The fort was bombarded by the Americans during the liberation of Toul. The 155mm guns of the Mougin turret were sent to Ouvrage Barbonnet, a S√©r√© de Rivi√®res fort in the Alps that had been modernized to function as part of the Alpine Line portion of the Maginot Line.  Present  An association has existed since 1961 to carry out restoration work on the fort. Portions were opened to the public in 1967 and the fort was listed on the inventory of historic structures in 1973. The Mougin turret and the north battery artillery have been restored to functional status. At present, the site is registered as a site pittoresque with tourism authorities, and is open from May to September. The preservation association uses Highland cattle to keep the vegetation on the surface of the fort under control.  Main enclosure  Because the village already occupied the best site, the fort was built to limit the cost and difficulty in moving the occupants. The villagers were opposed to relocation because the village occupies one of the only places where water is retained at the ground's surface, due to the presence of a layer of clay.  R√©duit  The fosse of the redoubt The r√©duit comprises the principal fortification of Villey-le-Sec. Constructed at the southwestern angle of the village , the r√©duit (a rallying point or center of resistance) forms a square, on each side. The r√©duit forms its own fort, concentrating together stores, quartering and ammunition magazines. Its plan is similar to the Fort de Lucey. However, its modernization was different and changed the fortification considerably. It is organized around a Mougin turret with two 155mm guns, one of only two working Mougin turrets. The guns were returned from Fort Barbonnet, which had two turrets. Four rectangular courts constitute the original barracks. Two concrete-protected barracks were constructed, one in 1888 in a special concrete, the other in 1910 in reinforced concrete which forms the present entry to the r√©duit. In 1914 a battery to be armed with two 155mm turrets was under construction but never completed.  Redan  Situated between the north and south batteries on the opposite side of the village from the redoubt, the redan is equipped with a 75mm gun turret and two armored observatories. A concreted barracks was added in 1890 under the turret. The redan was overlooked by a water tower and the steeple of the village church, which were dynamited in 1914 to prevent the Germans from using them to sight artillery. The Germans never came close to Villey, and the church tower was rebuilt in 1950. A third observation point was added during the war. In 2002 the preservation association pumped w to 2.5 meters of water from the works, allowing access to the barracks and turret. Limited stabilization work was done, and the area awaits restoration. It is not presently accessible to the public.  North battery  Aerial view of the north battery and village The north battery is located just to the north of the village. In the form of a V with legs long, it possessed a retractable 75mm gun turret and a machine gun turret, with two armored observatories. , 310 meters altitude. The battery controlled the plain. The entry was protected by an Ardagt et Pilter drawbridge. The position retains its double caponier. The restoration society has recovered the 75mm turret's guns from the ouvrage du Mordant and restored them so that they can fire blank rounds, along with the eclipsing action of the turret.  South battery  More imposing than the north battery, the south battery was planned to cover the Marron road, taking the valley of the Moselle in enfilade and facing the Bois l'Eveque. It lies to the southeast of the village. , 320 meters altitude. Like the north battery, the south battery was laid out in the form of a V. The south battery was not reinforced with concrete and retains its stone construction, with the exception of a concrete barracks added on the south side in 1890. It was planned to receive a 75mm gun, which was never installed. The entry was equipped with a rolling bridge by Th. Pilter that could be laterally displaced. The southern battery was used by the National School of Applied Geology and Mineral Exploration (√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de G√©ologie Appliqu√©e et de Prospection Mini√®re) in Nancy to store a radioactive mineral collection. South battery  Outer works   Redoute de Chaudeney  Also called the Charton redoubt, the Redoute de Chaudeney is located about one kilometer behind the fort at a location that could be used to bombard Toul. Its construction was initiated at the end of 1874 to anticipate delays in the construction of the main fort. Actual construction began in December 1875, predating the \\"panic\\" forts built after April‚ÄìMay 1875, when German chancellor Otto von Bismarck implied that Germany might initiate a pre-emptive war. The pentagonal position featured a Haxo casemate and a 164.7mm naval gun, protected by an earth rampart and masonry walls. The site is abandoned and covered with vegetation.  Batterie de Chaudeney  Four batteries were planned behind the redoubt , but only one was built, to the west in 1912. It was equipped with four 155mm guns. to the southeast of the batteries, a magazine was constructed. The magazine is abandoned but accessible.  Powder magazine of Bois sous roche  Buildings on the surface of the powder magazine Access to the powder magazine The powder magazine was located to the southwest of the fort . Constructed in 1890-91, it was equipped with its own well (now dry). Today it is in ruins and shelters bats (Myotis myotis, Plecotus, and Whiskered bats), with a temperature and humidity suitable for their hibernation. It is therefore designated a nature preserve and is closed to access.  Batteries de Bois sous roche  A set of six batteries was planned along the way to the powder magazine from the fort . Only four were built to the west in 1888, totaling 24 positions for 120mm or 155mm guns. A raised position behind the batteries shelters ammunition niches and conceals the 60 cm military railway from direct vision.  Advance post Ouvrage du Fays  A small infantry position north of the fort. . Constructed by a Declaration of Public Utility of 23 August 1889, it was planned to be slightly modernized between 1907 and 1914. Artillery magazine in the protective slope for the 60cm rail line  Train line  A P√©chot system rail line using a gauge of 60 cm was used to supply the fort. A P√©chot wagon remains, along with several traces of the old line and the protective slope that shielded the line. The Villey-le-Sec military rail line was built between 1889 and 1891, with extensions in 1906 to the Redoubt of Chaudeney and in 1913-14 to the road between Villey-le-Sec and Gondreville.

Hancock and starring Jan-Michael Vincent. The feature film was produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. Plot Marion ‚ÄúHedge‚Äù Hedgepeth, a Marine recruit during World War II, washes out in recruit training in San Diego. He is sent home in an unadorned baby blue uniform, leftover military surplus, as most recruits sent their civilian clothes home, thus the derogatory designation Baby Blue Marine. Traveling by bus to his home in St. Louis, Hedge meets a Marine Raider veteran at a stopover. The young, battle-scarred and highly decorated Marine has aged beyond his years with prematurely gray hair. As the Raider doesn't wish to return to the war, he knocks out Hedge and trades uniforms with him. Now penniless, with only the Raider uniform for clothing, Hedge hitchhikes towards St. Louis. He enters the idyllic small town of Bidwell, California, below Mount Shasta. His uniform‚Äôs decorations and Raider shoulder-sleeve insignia make him a hero to the community, whose own young men are away at the war. At the local diner, Hedge is befriended by waitress Rose, a recent high school graduate, and Mr. Elmore, a local who lost his son in the attack on Pearl Harbor. He also meets Army Private Danny Phelps, a local who just finished basic training and is awaiting assignment to the army typing pool. Rose invites Hedge to stay with her family for a few days, where Hedge bunks with her brother, Barney. Rose and Hedge fall in love, and he eventually tells her the truth of his story, saying that he has chosen to stay quiet because he does not want the real Raider to get in trouble for deserting. When three American-born teenaged boys escape from a local Japanese American internment camp, the camp‚Äôs small and inexperienced army troop is joined by the locals in searching the woods. Mr. Elmore reminds everyone that these are young American citizens, but some of the locals, particularly Private Phelps, seem hellbent on killing the ‚ÄúJaps‚Äù. Hedge finds the boys first, and they admit that they are sick of being unfairly held and are (naively) trying to get home to San Francisco. Phelps spots the scene from a nearby ridge and shoots, hitting Hedge, who falls into the rapids of a rushing mountain stream. The Japanese-American boys, aided by Mr. Elmore and a repentant Phelps, barely save the heavily bleeding Hedge from drowning. Thinking he might die, Hedge tells Rose to tell everyone his true story. When the war ends, Hedge returns to Bidwell and Rose, having served as a corporal under General Patton in the U.S. Third Army.

This was the first election in a British colony which used universal adult franchise. Background In 1931 the Donoughmore Constitution replaced the Legislative Council of Ceylon with the State Council of Ceylon as the legislature of British Ceylon. The State Council was to consist of 58 members of which 50 would be elected by universal suffrage and the remaining 8 members appointed the Governor. The old Legislative Council was dissolved on 17 April 1931 and candidate nominations took place on 4 May 1931. The Jaffna Youth Congress, an organisation that campaigned for Ceylon independence, called for a boycott of the election since the Donoughmore Constitution did not grant dominion status to Ceylon. Consequently, no nominations were received in four constituencies in the north of the country (Jaffna, Kankesanthurai, Kayts and Point Pedro). In addition, nine other constituencies only had a single nomination each and consequently the candidates were elected without a vote. Elections in the remaining 37 constituencies took place between 13 and 20 June 1931. In 1934 by-elections were held for the four vacant seats in the north.

It became a research center for the Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique (CEA), France's Atomic Energy Commission. The center was closed in 1997. History In 1870, France was partly occupied by the Prussian army. As a result of this defeat, the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications was built from 1874‚Äì1881 to defend Paris, consisting of 18 forts, five redoubts and 34 batteries. Construction started in 1876 on a roughly pentagonal fort with 48 artillery pieces and a garrison of 691 troops. Work was completed in 1882. The fort was updated in 1911 with a machine gun turret and a Mougin turret with two 155mm guns. The Fort de Vaujours is unique in its association with two annexes connected by a covered way to the main fort. The fort's barracks were burned in 1944. In 1947 the Sevran explosives works used the facility. From 1955 the site was occupied by the CEA as a research center, which considerably modified the fort and its environs. The CEA conducted pyrotechnic experiments at the location, using shock tubes and similar apparatus to study high-pressure shock waves in uranium. The Vaujours facility closed in 1997. The CEA proposed to sell the property, but concerns about radioactive contamination have stalled the sale. The large trapezoidal fort's main armament was a twin 155 mm Mougin turret. The turret remains, but its guns have been removed. Annexes Fort de Vaujours' artillery battery annexes are located to the north and south of the main fort, connected by covered ways. The northern battery was manned by 162 troops with six gun mounts in casemates. The fort formed a rectangle, surrounded by a ditch which lacked the caponiers of the main fort for its defense. The south annex also has six gun emplacements. The north battery is being demolished while the south battery is in very good state and occupied by an association.

Ua Cerbaill was a supporter of the Irish religious reform movement of the 11th century. He was a close associate of Saint Malachy, and with him founded Mellifont Abbey, the first Cistercian abbey to be built in Ireland. He was also responsible for foundations by the Arrouaisian order at Louth, Knock Abbey and Termonfeckin. He was central to the successful overthrow of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, High King of Ireland, who in violation of an oath had blinded Donnchad's foster-son Eochaid Mac Duinn Sl√©ibe the king of Ulaid in 1166. Afterwards he placed √Åed in Mac√°em T√≥inlesc on the throne of T√≠r Eogain. He was a half-brother of Tigern√°n Ua Ruairc, King of Br√©ifne. Ua Cerbhaill was a successful political operator on both a regional and local level. His religious foundations show his success in tying the reform movements interests to his own, facilitating as they did the consolidation of conquests he made. In alienating religious sites from local dynasts he undermined their use as a power base for future opposition and created a vested interest for the religious orders in maintaining the status quo. He was able to incorporate the Ulaid sub-kingdom of Conaille Muirtheimne, and the Midhe sub-kingdom of Fir Arda Ciannachta into his kingdom, the basis of modern County Louth, during the \\"High Kings with Opposition\\" period of instability which saw provincial armies repeatedly criss-cross the area, multiple divisions of Midhe, and frequent changes of kings. To reflect this change, between c. 1140 to c. 1190, County Louth was transferred from the see of Armagh to the see of Clogher. During this period the Bishop of Clogher (frequently 'Bishop of Airg√≠alla' in the chronicles) used the style Bishop of Louth. This change reflects the shift in center of the Ua Cerbhaill U√≠ Chremthainn sub-kingdom south within Airg√≠alla from the time of the Synod of R√°th Breasail in 1111 to the 1130s when Ua Cerbaill was establishing his base of power in Fernmag and around the settlement of Louth. This shift was precipitated by expansion of the Cen√©l Fearadhaigh Theas, a powerful Cen√©l nEoghain group, into the Clogher Valley. The title Bishop of Clogher was resumed after 1193, when County Louth was restored to the see of Armagh. By that time the Ua Cerbhaill family had been eclipsed and County Louth or 'English' Oriel had been lost to the Norman colony.
