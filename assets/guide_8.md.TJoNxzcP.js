The Vainakhs. Page 29 They were mostly known as Karabulaks, which they are called in Russian, from their Kumyk name. They also called themselves \\"Baloi\\". They were variously called an independent people, a subgroup of Chechens, or a subgroup of Ingush (which was further complicated by the fact that many in the 19th century considered Ingush to be a subgroup of Chechens, including many Ingush themselves). Their language is thought to have been somewhere between Chechen and Ingush (not unlike today's Galanchozh dialect spoken by the Myalkhi tukhum). Differentiation from Chechens and Ingush The Russians and the Kumyks both seem to have called the Arshtins a separate people, but other people of the region seem to have considered them simply to be Chechens separated from their fellows by political boundaries, due to the division of Vainakh land between Kumyks and Circassians. However, both micro- Chechens and Arshtins overthrew their overlords, the former establishing the clan-based democratic \\"Ichkerian\\" (from Turkish, meaning the free people) state based around Tukhum loyalties. The Arshtins may or may not have been separate from this. Downfall The late 1850s saw the end of the Eastern and Central Caucasian resistance to Tsarist rule was defeated; and in 1865, the Caucasian cleansing operations occurred. Although they mainly targeted Circassians for expulsion or murder, the Arshtins also fell victim. In May‚ÄìJuly 1865, according to official documents, 1366 Arshtin families disappeared (i.e. either fled or were killed) and only 75 remained.

Sundri Uttamchandani Smt. Sundri Uttamchandani (28 September 1924 ‚Äì 8 July 2013) was a noted Indian writer. She wrote mostly in Sindhi language. She was married to progressive writer A. J. Uttam. In 1986 she was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award by Sahitya Akademi in Sindhi for her Book Vichhoro, a compilation of nine short stories.Sahitya Academy Awards in Sindhi Biography Sundri Uttamchandani was born on 28 September 1924 at Hyderabad Sindh (now in Pakistan). Hydrabad was the capital of Sindh before the conquest of Sindh by the British. Though it lost its position as a capital city but, it continued to be a thriving centre of education literature and culture. All reform movements were rooted in its soil. At the very young age, Sundri was exposed to a vast repertoire of folk and mythological tales which were narrated by her parents to her and other children of the extended joint family. During her youth the freedom movement was sweeping across the country and she could not but be drawn to it. While still in college she translated a story \\"Bhadur Maao Ji Bahadur Deeah\\" (A brave daughter of a brave mother). This was her initiation in the literary field. She married Assandas Uttamchandani (A.J.Uttam), a Freedom fighter, with a keen interest in Sindhi Literature with clear leanings toward Marxist Philosophy and, who become in the later years one of the leading writers of Sindhi progressive literary movement, A J Uttam, was one of the founders of Sindhi Sahit Mandal in Bombay. Sundri accompanied him to weekly literary meetings which were presided over by a fatherly figure, Prof M U Malkani, who was a fountain head of encouragement to new and upcoming writers. This exposure to Sindhi writers and their creative works were to become source of inspiration for her and in the year 1953 she produced her first novel \\"Kirandar Deewaroon\\" (Crumbling walls). This proved to be path breaking. She shattered the near monopoly of male domination in literature by her one feat, while on the one hand, she won the accolades and acclaim of all senior writers for use of 'homely' language, a folksy- idiomatic language used by women folk in their household and thus brought in a new literary flavour in Sindhi literature. The theme and structure of the novel was mature and it has distinction of being reprinted many times over. This Novel was translated into many Indian languages and brought her acclaim by literary critics of those languages, thus elevating her from a writer of a regional language to a writer of All India fame. Her Second Novel \\"Preet Purani Reet Niraali\\" came in the year 1956, which has run into 5 reprints, which amply speaks of its merit and popularity. Apart from her path breaking novels, it is in short story form in which she found herself more comfortable. She has collections of short stories to her credit some of which have gone into various reprints. Some of her short stories have become water mark in this genre and are often cited as outstanding examples. Her Story\\" Bhoori\\" (A doll) brings out in stark relief the beauty of yester years, who due to ravages of partition of the country has lost her enchanting looks but is radiant with inner beauty born out of dignity of labour and assured demeanor to shoulder economic responsibilities to feed her family, thus standing shoulder to shoulder with her husband, ushering in gender equality without being sounding stirringly feminist.Her first story 'Mamta' against the war won her first prize in 1952 in a short story competition. 'Koshan' was another story which also appreciated and received first prize in 1954 from Kahani Magazine.In early sixties a Publisher of 'KAHANI' magazine had organised a short story competition in which many stalwarts of the time participated and Sundri's short story \\"KHEER BARIYA HATHRA\\" won the first prize. This was story published in a book titled as \\"KHEER BARIYA HATHRA\\" 1960 by KAHANI. Her story \\"HI SHAHAR\\" (This City) is everlasting portrayal of a meek Nepali watchman in a lower middle class apartment building in this city as a vast ruthless and soul less machine, unmindful of the personal loss or tragedy. Sundri has tried her hand at traditional poetry with proper meter but it is in free verse where she has found her niche. She has four poetry collections to her credit. Her poems delve deep into subtle and delicate gamut of emotions and find artistic and imaginative articulation with her individual stamp. Apart from winning many awards throughout her vast and eventful literary career, she was bestowed prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award for her Book \\"Vichhoro\\" in the year 1986. As a part of Progressive Writers' movement she has written on erstwhile Soviet Union, \\"NAEEN SABHYATA Jo DARSHAN' and Bharat Roos ba Banh Beli (India Russia two comrades in arms) for which she won The coveted Soviet Land Award. She has inspired many women writers to contribute to Sindhi literature and will continue to inspire future generations. Literary career Started writing in the year 1946. She has written 200 Short Stories, 2 Novels, 12 one act plays, Approx. 500 essays 200 poems. Has translated many novels, short stories and poems of renowned writers viz.

Falmouth Hauler Trashes Town Law, Cape Cod Times, 21 July 2010 . Retrieved 22 September 2010. As of June 2010 the station is operated by two Falmouth Department of Public Works employees. According to an April 2010 commission report, the UCRTS takes in 36,519 tons of municipal waste annually. The total cost to operate the station is about $300,000 annually. The towns served by the UCRTS have 30-year disposal contracts with SEMASS that are set to expire between 2015 and 2016. As of 2010 the present- day per-ton rates paid by the towns are all well below market rates, and new agreements will be far more expensive. The Cape Cod Commission is exploring future means of trash disposal for all 15 towns within the district, including transport to out-of-state facilities, but most of the options under consideration would retain and perhaps expand use of the UCRTS. It was announced on 5 December 2014 that the station would close at the end of the month due to changes in contracts with SEMASS by towns in the immediate region.

He also designed the dining room on the RMS Titanic, which was based on his design for that in the Hotel Russell in Bloomsbury. Doll was educated in Germany, and on his return to Britain he trained as an architect under Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt. Under Wyatt he was involved in designing the India Office in London, a project he worked on from 1866 to 1868. In 1885 Doll was appointed Surveyor to the Bedford Estates in Bloomsbury and Covent Garden in London. In 1898 he designed the Hotel Russell, which is distinctively clad in decorative th√©-au-lait (\\"tea with milk\\") terracotta, and which was based on the Ch√¢teau de Madrid on the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. Doll engaged the sculptor Henry Charles Fehr to model the four life-size statues of British Queens, who look down from above the main front entrance. The hotel's restaurant, until recently named Fitzroy Doll's, is said to be almost identical to the RMS Titanic\`s dining room which he also designed. Later, Doll designed the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square (which was demolished in the late 1960s and rebuilt in a contemporary style), and which was described by Pevsner as a ‚Äòvicious mixture of Art Nouveau Gothic and Art Nouveau Tudor‚Äô. In 1907 Doll designed the Flemish French-Gothic terrace of shops with apartments over them in Torrington Place.

Establishing a clear competency structure is one of the first and fundamental steps in profile development. Definition A competency architecture describes the common rules for defining competencies within the organization. It includes the guiding principles that describe how the profiles will be designed for the entire organization ‚Äì e.g., the format for displaying the competency profile, content for the profile (e.g. behavioral competencies and technical/professional competencies), core vs. unique competencies, etc.) There are three basic criteria that competency structures in most organizations must meet: # The competency profiles must include the competencies that employees must have, both now and in the future, to ensure that organization can achieve its vision and support its values; # The competency profiles must support all of their intended applications (e.g., Recruitment/Selection; Learning and Development; Performance Management; Multisource Feedback; Career Development and Succession Management; Human Resources Planning); and # All competency profiles must be easy to use by all stakeholders. Competency architecture right Several competency architectures are possible. Each organization needs to identify the architecture that best meets its needs. The following figure graphically depicts a model that is typically used as the basis for the development of competency profiles and the implementation of competency-based management. This or similar models in combination with a well-researched and constructed Competency Dictionary have been used successfully by many organizations as the basic framework for developing competency profiles. =Competency layers= The model builds from the vision, values and strategic business priorities of the organization and includes the following competency layers: Core Competencies ‚Äì The Core competencies include very general/generic competencies that all employees must possess to enable the organization to achieve its mandate and vision (e.g., Teamwork). These competencies describe in behavioral terms the key values of the organization and represent those competencies that are core to the organization‚Äôs principal mandate Job Family Competencies ‚Äì Job Family competencies are those competencies that are common to a group of jobs. They often include General Job competencies that tend to be required in a number of Job Families (e.g., Partnering), as well as Job Specific competencies that apply to certain job families more than others (e.g., Project Management). These tend to be related more to knowledge or skill required for certain types of jobs (e.g., Accounting for jobs involving financial administration) Technical / Professional Competencies ‚Äì The technical/professional competencies tend to be specific to roles or jobs within the Job Family, and include the specific skills and knowledge (know- how) to perform effectively (e.g. ability to use particular software; knowledge in particular professional areas such as finance, biochemistry; etc.). These competencies could be generic to a Job Family as a whole, or be specific to roles, levels or jobs within the family. Leadership Competencies ‚Äì These are the key competencies for roles in an organization that involve managing, supervising or influencing the work of others in some way. Some organizations view \\"leadership\\" to be a part of every job of the organization in that employees are expected to contribute and offer new or better ways of working regardless of their level or role in the organization. Leadership is required in teams, project management, as well as at the managerial, executive and board levels. Consistent with the requirement for ease of use, organizations typically define a limit on the number of key / important competencies that are included in the profile for any job / role within the organization. As a rule of thumb, best practice organizations establish a limit on the total number of competencies included in any one profile in the range of 12 to 15. =Example guideline= A typical set of rules for one organization‚Äôs competency profile development is: * Up to 12 competencies per profile, including five (5) core competencies. * Core Competencies ‚Äì 5 competencies that apply to all employees * Job Family Competencies ‚Äì Common to whole family * Technical / Professional (work specific) Competencies - Apply to some or all jobs / roles in group See also  References  Related literature  =Books= * Dubois, D., & Rothwell, W.

Competency Model Statistical Validation and Business Case Development, HR Technologies White Paper Human resource management ","title":"Competency architecture"},{"id":"28927405","text":"A competency dictionary is a tool or data structure that includes all or most of the general competencies needed to cover all job families and competencies that are core or common to all jobs within an organization (e.g., teamwork; adaptability; communication). They may also include competencies that are more closely related to the knowledge and skills needed for specific jobs or functions (e.g., IT skills, financial administration skills). Comprehensive A typical comprehensive competency dictionary should include a broad range of competencies developed through extensive literature search, review of best practices as well as ongoing refinement based on field research with various client groups. The competencies in the dictionary are required by a broad range of employees functioning within a wide variety of private and public sector organizations. The demonstration of these competencies by employees and managers is related to increased performance at the individual, team, and organizational levels. Each competency has a general definition, which provides the user with a general understanding of the type of behavior addressed by a particular competency. Each competency includes up to five proficiency levels and each level has an associated brief statement describing how that particular level is distinct from the other levels within that competency. The behavioral indicators at each proficiency level are illustrative of the proficiency level as opposed to representing a definitive list of all possible behaviors at each level. Finally, the defined levels of proficiency for each competency are incremental and additive so that employees demonstrating proficiency at a particular level can be assumed to perform effectively at all competency levels below. Many Comprehensive Competency Dictionaries are divided into two sets of competencies: # General job competencies ‚Äì common across many jobs and demonstrate the key behaviors required for success regardless of position. # Job-specific competencies ‚Äì these are required for success in particular functions or jobs. =Proficiency levels= Organizations typically include incremental competency proficiency scales as part of the overall competency structure. These scales reflect the amount of proficiency typically required by the organization within a competency area. For example, communication skills may be a requirement for most entry-level jobs as well as at the executive levels; however, the amount of communication proficiency needed at these two levels may be quite different. The proficiency scales serve two purposes: # They facilitate planning and development for improvement within current roles or jobs; and # They allow for comparisons to occur across jobs, roles and levels, not only in terms of the competencies required, but also the proficiency levels needed using a common incremental scale for defining the competencies. Thus, having competency proficiency scales supports career development, succession management and human resource planning activities within the organization. 600px General Work competencies are most often expressed as incremental competency proficiency scales ‚Äì in other words, proficiency at one level assumes proficiency at all levels below that level on the scale. Work Specific competencies, on the other hand, may be expressed as common group requirements and, where required, differences in proficiency requirements (by level of responsibility in a specified field of work) may be noted. =Target proficiency levels= Organizations typically define in their competency profiles the levels of performance (proficiency) to be attained for each competency. These are often driven by the use to be made of the competency profiles. For example: * Entry ‚Äì is the standard expected of employees on entry into a role. This is often used when the new entrant must learn or be trained to be able to perform to the standards required within the role. * Fully Effective ‚Äì is level required of employees who are performing at the standard expected for their role. * Stretch / Mastery ‚Äì is typically displayed by employees who have mastered their role. These employees are often sought out by other employees and supervisors to provide advice or assistance. It is important to define what standard (or standards) of performance will be modeled in the competency profiles as a component of the competency architecture. An example of how these standards for employee performance relate to competency proficiency is shown below. Dictionary options =Building versus purchasing a dictionary= Organizations may choose to create their own competency dictionaries, or purchase one that has been developed by experts in competency profiling and competency-based management. The advantage of developing a competency dictionary is that it will reflect which competencies are required for success in the organization and it will expressed in a way that reflects the values, vision and way of communicating within the organization. On the other hand, this option is very costly and time-consuming, and most do not have the internal expertise to complete this task =Purchasing= Purchasing a competency dictionary from a reputable company has the advantage of providing the organization with a well-developed and researched dictionary that can be used in a timely manner to support profile development and implementation. The disadvantage is that the dictionary may not reflect the full range of competencies needed, nor reflect them in a language that is suitable for the organization. =Hybrid option= Organizations often achieve a compromise by customizing a purchased competency dictionary (e.g., adding competencies, modifying the language slightly to reflect the organization's style of communicating and including additional behavioural indicators to reflect performance expectations of the organization). This provides a quick and cost-effective solution, and results in a Competency Dictionary that is targeted to the organization's specific needs.

German and Portuguese troops clashed several times on the border between German South West Africa and Portuguese Angola. The Germans won most of these clashes and were able to occupy the Humbe region of southern Angola until Portuguese control was restored a few days before the British campaign out of South Africa defeated the Germans. Background Portuguese troops embarking for Angola From 1911 until July 1914, the German and British Empires secretly negotiated about possible dismemberment of Portuguese Angola.The Anglo-German Negotiations over the Portuguese Colonies in Africa, 1911-14, J. D. Vincent-Smith, The Historical Journal, Vol. 17, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), pp. 620-629. JStor link In such a case most of the land would fall into the hands of the Germans. Angola- Bund, founded in 1912, was the German organization promoting the takeover. Even before World War I started (September 1914), the Portuguese government had sent reinforcements to the southern border of Angola. After the war broke out, the border between German South West Africa and Angola remained open. The Germans hoped they would be able to supply food and possibly even arms through it. However, the Portuguese colonial government was rather hostile and attempted to thwart all possible trade. A few German nationals in Angola were interned. Campaign Fighting in southern Portuguese Angola took place before a formal state of war had been declared between Germany and Portugal (Germany declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916) when clashes occurred between October 1914 and July 1915. Due to the possibility of an attack from German Southwest Africa, Portuguese forces in southern Angola were reinforced by a military expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel Alves Ro√ßadas, which arrived at Mo√ß√¢medes on 1 October 1914. Since mid-1914, there had been several incidents between Portuguese and German troops. The first serious one was the Naulila incident on 19 October, in which 3 German officers, heading a military column which had entered Angola without permission from the Portuguese authorities, were killed by Portuguese troops.Fraga, p.127 On 31 October, German troops armed with machine guns launched a surprise attack on the small Portuguese outpost at Cuangar, killing 2 officers, 1 sergeant, 5 soldiers and 1 civilian.Fraga, p.128 The attack became known as the \\"Cuangar Massacre\\". On 18 December the largest clash of the campaign occurred. A German force of 2,000 men under the command of Major Victor Franke attacked Portuguese forces positioned at Naulila. After stubborn resistance, the Portuguese were forced to withdraw towards the Humbe region, with 69 soldiers dead, among them 3 officers, 76 wounded, among them 1 officer, and 79 prisoners, among them 3 officers, while the Germans had 12 soldiers dead and 30 wounded, among them 10 officers.Fraga, p.128 After the explosion of the munitions magazine at Forte Ro√ßadas base, the Portuguese also left the Humbe, withdrawing farther north. On 7 July 1915, Portuguese forces under the command of General Pereira d'E√ßa reoccupied the Humbe region. Two days later, German forces in South West Africa surrendered, ending the South West Africa Campaign. Until September 1915, the Portuguese continued fighting in southern Angola against local groups who resisted colonial occupation, and who in part had received arms from the Germans.Ren√© P√©lissier, Les guerres grises: R√©sistance et revoltes en Angola (1845-1941), Montamets/Orgeval: √âditions P√©lissier, 1977 Notes References  * Historicus Africanus, \\"Naulila\\", Band II, Der 1.

History and Work The Forum for Women and Development has its roots in the 1989 national telethon which supported \\"women in the third world,\\" and which had been initiated by women's organizations, especially the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. In 1995 the two organizations that had been established to implement the \\"Women in the Third World\\" program were dissolved and replaced by a new permanent organization, the Forum for Women and Development. The primary goal of the Forum for Women and Development according to its bylaws is to contribute to the improvement of women‚Äôs social, economic, and political situation in the Global South. The forum only has other organizations as members, and does not have individual members. Member organizations are required to have at least 50 female members and aim to promote women's interests. The forum currently has around 50 women's organizations and women's committees in political parties, trade unions, and solidarity and aid organizations as members. The forum receives financial support from the Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (UD) through framework agreements on development and information activities. The political leadership, the Executive Board, is elected by the member organizations. Since 2017, Sylvi Graham is President of the forum. The forum has a small secretariat in Oslo which supports the Executive Board in their work. The head of the secretariat is Gro Lindstad. In 2005, the forum was the beneficiary of the Norwegian national television‚Äôs Telethon, whose funds have gone to combating violence against women. In 2014, the main women's rights organizations in Norway additionally founded the Norwegian Women's Lobby as an umbrella organization for the Norwegian women's movement with a broader focus than the Global South. Most of its member organizations also participate in the Forum for Women and Development, but the organizations have a different focus. In 2018 the Forum for Women and Development and five other key NGOs organized the customary torchlight parade in Oslo in honor of that year's Nobel Peace Prize laureates, Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, who were awarded the prize for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.

They are part of the Stadler GTW family of rail vehicles, developed by Stadler Rail. Due to their boxy shape, and angled cab ends, the members of the class have been nicknamed \\"Tetrapaks\\". Background Star√Ω Smokovec, Summer 2006. The TE≈Ω is a long line connecting Poprad-Tatry railway station, on the standard gauge Ko≈°ice‚ÄìBohum√≠n Railway, with a number of ski, tourist, and health resorts in the nearby High Tatras. Opened in 1908, the line was completely refurbished in the late 1960s, and is now operated by the ≈Ωelezniƒçn√° spoloƒçnos≈• Slovensko () (ZSSK). By the end of the twentieth century, the ƒåSD Class EMU 89.0 multiple units, which had entered service on the TE≈Ω as an integral part of the 1960s refurbishment, had reached the end of their working lives. The fifteen members of the ZSSK Class 425.95 were gradually introduced from 2000 to replace them, and now operate all TE≈Ω services. Technical details The tender for the supply of 14 units was won by a consortium, GTW High Tatras, which had been formed by the companies ≈ΩOS Vr√∫tky, Stadler Rail and Daimler-Chrysler Rail Systems. The design of the class was based upon that of the Stadler GTW 2/6. The overall assembly of the class members was carried out by ≈ΩOS Vr√∫tky. Each unit is made up of three sections. The middle section, with a carbody made of steel, is fitted with electrical equipment and traction motors driving a twin axle bogie. Each of the lightweight outer sections, made of aluminium, has a passenger compartment, a driver's workstation, and an unpowered twin axle bogie. The three sections are connected together by steel-rubber joints. A Class 425.95 train in the mountains, Summer 2006. The roof of the middle section is equipped with an electrically controlled pantograph to collect DC current. Each drive axle in the middle bogie is powered by a three-phase asynchronous motor, fed by an inverter changing the DC power supply to AC. All units have four braking systems - electro-operating regenerative brakes and an electromagnetic brake on the drive chassis and an electro-mechanical brake and a spring parking brake on all axles. Air suspension is used to minimize the transmission of vibration from the chassis to the passenger compartment. Each outer section is fitted with electrically driven double-leaf doors, operated by on-demand controls. In the boarding area inside the doors, there are outboard folding seats, 10 holders for skis or bicycles, and handles for standing passengers. The portions of the outer sections between the boarding areas and the driver's compartments have an elevated floor, accessible from the boarding areas by stairs. The portions between the boarding areas and the middle section have low floors. The upholstered passenger seats in all parts of the passenger compartments are arranged in a 2 + 2 configuration with a middle aisle. On each side of these compartments are large windows with tinted double glazing. The driver's workstations are separated from the passenger compartments by partly glazed partitions and all glass doors. In normal use, the passenger compartments are ventilated by microprocessor controlled ceiling ducts. Emergency ventilation can be achieved by tilting open the upper parts of some of the side windows. Heating elements are fitted to the sidewalls. Interior lighting is provided by fluorescent lamps, and the passenger compartments also have visual information systems, with multilingual acoustic stop announcements. All members of the class have been liveried since new in a red, white and grey design. Service history Poprad-Tatry, Summer 2006. The first member of the class arrived at Poprad in mid-October 2000, after being displayed at the International Engineering Fair in Brno. On 19 October 2000, it made its first trip on the TE≈Ω, an unpowered run to Star√Ω Smokovec behind a Class EMU 89.0. Between November 2000 and March 2001, the class leader, numbered 425.951, underwent testing on the network. It then operated trial runs with passengers. The testing process revealed certain incompatibilities between modern vehicles and the TE≈Ω's then outdated track and power systems. The latter therefore required some conversion work, including reprofiling of the lines in some sections, reconstruction of the platforms across the network, and also adjustments to the power system to enable it to benefit from the new vehicles' regenerative brakes. Eventually the class leader completed the tests and entered regular service. In 2001-2002, a total of 13 further units and one spare middle section were delivered. They gradually replaced the Class EMU 89.0 units, which were progressively retired. However, the total capacity of the new units proved to be somewhat inadequate, given that only 14 units had replaced 18 predecessors. In 2006, therefore, some of the Class EMU 89.0 units were returned to service to supplement the new units. The same year, two additional class 425.95 outer sections were acquired, and combined with the spare section to make up a fifteenth unit. The class 425.95s are also capable of multiple unit operation in pairs. The individual units are numbered as 425 951 to 425.965.

He regarded it as one of the least studied countries in Latin America by academic scholars in the United States and Europe, and was considered the first American historian to study and introduce Colombian history as an academic field in the United States. Early life and career Bushnell was born on May 14, 1923 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard University. After graduation, Bushnell worked for both the Latin American Division of the Office of Strategic Services and the United States State Department from 1944 to 1946. From 1956 to 1963, Bushnell worked as a United States Air Force historian based in Washington D.C. and New Mexico. He co-authored Space Biology for the U.S. Air Force, which chronicled high- altitude experiments which experts designed to launch people into outer space during the early years of the space program. He also oversaw the creation of an official written history of NASA and served on the NASA Historical Advisory Committee during this period. Bushnell first visited Colombia as a doctoral student in 1948. He completed his doctorate at Harvard University in 1951 by writing his thesis on the government of Francisco de Paula Santander. Bushnell would ultimately become one of the world's foremost experts on the history of modern Colombia during his career. Bushnell worked as a professor and academic at the University of Delaware and the University of Florida. He taught at the University of Florida from 1963, when he left the U.S. Air Force, until his retirement in 1991. He remained a professor emeritus at the University of Florida and co-founded the Friends of the University of Florida Center for Latin American Studies in March 2005. He also served as the editor-in-chief of the Hispanic American Historical Review from 1986 to 1991. In 1975 he served as chair of the Conference on Latin American History, the professional organization of Latin American historians affiliated with the American Historical Association.http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=542 Besides works on Colombian history, he co-authored with Neill W. Macaulay, Jr. The Emergence of Latin America in the Nineteenth Century (1988, 2nd: 1994, ). Colombia historian In 1993, Bushnell published his most widely read work on Colombian history, \\"The Making of Modern Colombia: A Nation in Spite of Itself\\", which was published in Spanish and then translated into English. The book became mandatory reading for scholars and students of Colombian history and politics. His other major works included The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia, The Emergence of Latin America, and Eduardo Santos and the good neighbor.

The orchestra consists of 66 musicians giving approximately 20 performances a year, mainly in the opera house and in the Salle Poirel, as well as other halls in Lorraine. It also accompanies all productions of the Op√©ra national de Lorraine. The precursor ensemble was established in 1884 as a municipal orchestra, with guidance from Edouard Brunel, the director of the Conservatoire de Nancy, and gave its first concert on 27 June 1884. In 1889, the composer Joseph-Guy Ropartz, a successor to Brunel as director of the Conservatoire, and the director of the opera, Albert Carr√©, set up a season of symphonic concerts taking place in the Salle Poirel, built specifically for this purpose. In 1979, the orchestra became independent in 1979 and took its current name. The current music director of the orchestra is Rani Calderon, effective with the 2015-2016 season. Calderon had previously served as principal guest conductor of the orchestra in the 2014-2015 season.

Biography He graduates in architecture in 1994 at the Politecnico di Milano. That same year he wins the first prize of San Carlo Borromeo at La Permanente of Milan, under the jury of Achille Castiglioni and Giancarlo De Carlo, with the Ekeberg sauna made in Sweden. He founds Atelier Forte in 1998, an architecture and sculpture research laboratory that deals with the design and creation of artistic and architectural works.Jessica Donati , The New York Times, August 18, 2010 Every year since 2003, he has been organizing a workshop of art and architecture in Sweden called StugaProject, near the town of Grythyttan. He has been a member of the Swedish Association of Architects since 2005. He participates in the 11th International Architecture Exhibition of Venice (2008) with Sleipnir Venexia.Luc Le Chatelier, Venise hisse le pavilion, , T√©l√©rama, September 23, 2008 It was on 12 February 2009, for the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth, that Duilio Forte wrote the Arkizoic Manifesto, the architectural style characterized by the union between architecture and Anemos, the breath of life. He participates in the 12th International Architecture Exhibition of Venice (2010) with Sleipnir Convivalis.The Italian Pavilion, , labiennale.orgAbitare, AILATI. REFLECTIONS FROM THE FUTURE, Padiglione Italia , April 5, 2010 He participates to the XXI Triennale International Exhibition of Milan in 2016 with the work URSUS at the exhibition Rooms, curator Beppe Finessi. :\\"His whole life is a workshop. He is the veritable \\"Craftsman\\" of the Italian architecture, both designer and builder. He doesn't need to talk to the workers or constantly see what they are doing. He does everything himself. His pencil is a saw, his AutoCAD is a welder. He makes everything he needs with his own hands, partly because it would be very difficult to explain to anyone else what's going on inside his complicated, visionary, fantastic head.\\" (Beppe Finessi, Domus 935, April 2010]) ArkiZoic Manifesto ArkiZoic style is determined by the rule (points 1‚Äì4), and the shape (points 5‚Äì8) 1\\\\. METHOD ArkiZoic style stems from the heuristic method application, the use of analogy, symbol and metamorphosis. It seeks the rigor of the method but imprecision of result too. It has its foundation in mathematics, in Fibonacci numbers and the golden Ratio. 2\\\\. EVOLUTION Arkizoic style develops according to natural evolution, by the respect of tradition, the exploitation of chance and natural selection. 3\\\\. MATHEMATICS Arkizoic manifesto interprets mathematics as the ordering principle of nature, a principle which is supported by studying the conduct of the Fibonacci numbers in the golden ratio. In particular the observation of analogies between the human figure and objective nature. 4\\\\. REPRESENTATION ArkiZoic form cannot be represented by geometric design, the executives are sketches that convey the emotion of the project. The drawings are produced after the end of physical realisation. 5\\\\. STRUCTURE Complexity is typical of living beings as the known forms are the result of millions of years of evolution. The reading of ArkiZoic work observed a musical recording with several melodies, the rhythm comes from the frequency of the adjacent elements and the possibility of an ideal continuation of the same. The Arkizoic works have articulation and they are constructed so that they can not ever really be considered finished. 6\\\\. SYMMETRY Natural forms are linked to the concept of imperfect symmetry. The order is determined by the symmetrical principle but the perfect membership to this principle is not binding, but rather disturbing perception. 7\\\\. MATERIALS Used only natural and traditional materials. There are no prefabricated artificial or recycled materials. The materials require maintenance, show evident signs of working and age, and they are rough. 8\\\\. DECORATION ArkiZoic form presents board, surface and punctual decoration. It is inspired by nature, from the animal kingdom to the vegetable one, and by tradition.

Life Born in Perugia, he was first a puer chori (boy soprano) at San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome under Giovanni Bernardino Nanino; then he was engaged as a contralto until July 1594 and as a bass from the beginning of May 1600 until the end of 1601. In 1603 he was mastro di capella of Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome. After an illness in 1606, in 1609 he left this work and became maestro at the Duomo of Benevento until 1615 (but in 1614 he worked for Cardinal Arrigoni in Rome). From 2 July 1616 he turned to San Luigi dei Francesi holding the same positions, and in 1620 he succeeded Francesco Soriano as maestro of the Cappella Giulia at San Pietro. In 1629 he was deponent for the testament of the composer Domenico Allegri, brother of Gregorio. From May 1631 he was again maestro of San Luigi, and held the post until his death in 1638; his successor was his pupil Orazio Benevoli.

He returned to Scotland in 1799 when he inherited an earldom from his nephew Charles Erskine, 8th Earl Kellie, and thus, became the 9th Earl of Kellie. Biography Erskine was born in Scotland to an aristocratic family that had become comparatively impoverished because of confiscations due to their support for the Stuart pretenders.Gilchrist (2004); Hildebrand (1953b), p. 481 He was probably born at Cambo House in Fife, one of the forfeited properties.Gilchrist (2004) =Gothenburg= At a young age, he was sent to Gothenburg to learn a trade. He was employed in 1759 in the office of George Carnegie, a Jacobite exile who had established himself as a merchant there. After a few years, he transferred to the firm of the iron-exporting English brothers John and Benjamin Hall, and became a partner in the firm in 1767. In his 30 years as a partner, he managed to amass a large fortune. In addition to retaining his partnership in the firm of the Hall brothers, Erskine pursued business under his own name, later partnering with David Mitchell from Montrose, who took over Thomas Erskine & Co. as sole owner after Erskine's departure for Scotland. In 1775 Erskine was appointed British consul for Gothenburg, Marstrand, and the other port cities on the West Coast of Sweden. As such, he wrote regular reports to the British government, including reports on the Swedish contraband trade with France during the revolutionary wars.Hildebrand (1953b), p. 482 This position also enhanced his social position in Gothenburg.Hildebrand (1953b), p. 482 He was one of the 20 (at the time unmarried and for the largest part British-born) founding members of the Royal Bachelors' Club, an English-type gentlemen's club established in 1769 mainly in order to circumvent a ban on the playing of billiards at public establishments.Hildebrand (1953b), p. 481 ff =Return to Scotland= Erskine bought back Cambo House in 1790. He spent the winter of 1793‚Äì94 in Scotland, but returned to Gothenburg, where he remained as consul and continued his business until 1799. In that year he inherited the Earldom of Kellie from his nephew Charles Erskine.According to Hildebrand (1953a, p. 478, and 1953b, p. 483), he inherited a baronetcy already in 1793 from his brother Captain David Erskine, who had previously inherited it from their oldest brother, Charles Erskine. Gilchrist (2004) does not mention a baronetcy, except the new one created for his grandson. His definite departure for Scotland was troubled by a conflict with the Gothenburg City Council, which demanded that he pay a sixth of his fortune before leaving Sweden.Hildebrand (1953b), p. 483 As Earl of Kellie, Erskine was elected a representative Scottish peer in the British House of Lords in 1804, was re-elected in 1807, and remained such until his death. In 1824, he succeeded the Earl of Morton as Lord Lieutenant of Fife.Gilchrist (2004) Marriage and family In 1771 Thomas Erskine wed Anne Gordon, a daughter of Captain Adam Gordon of Ardoch. The marriage was childless, but Erskine's daughter born out of wedlock, Harriet (born in 1763), married Johan Henrik Engelhart, professor of medicine at Lund. Four of Harriet's children were raised in their grandfather's house in Scotland. While the earldom was inherited by Erskine's brother Methven, a new Erskine Baronetcy was granted in 1820 to the 9th Earl's grandson, David Engelhart, who changed his name to Erskine and on whom Thomas Erskine entailed the estate of Cambo. David's sister, Harriet Engelhart, married a first cousin, another David Erskine (a grand nephew of the 9th Earl of Kellie and the natural son of Sir David Erskine) who settled as a merchant in Stockholm.Hildebrand (1953a), p. 479 Notes References *Gilchrist, Marianne McLeod (2004): \\"Erskine, Thomas, ninth earl of Kellie (1745/6‚Äì1828)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 24 July 2010. *Hildebrand, Bengt (1953a): \\"Erskine\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Vol. 14, pp. 476‚Äì480. *Hildebrand, Bengt (1953b): \\"Erskine, Thomas\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Vol. 14, pp. 480‚Äì484. 1746 births 1828 deaths Scottish merchants Lord-Lieutenants of Fife Scottish representative peers Scottish expatriates in Sweden Thomas 18th-century Scottish people 19th-century Scottish people 9 ","title":"Thomas Erskine, 9th Earl of Kellie"},{"id":"28927662","text":"Atalanta B.C. returned to Serie A following a two-year absence, and immediately established itself on the top half of the table, finishing in 7th place.

Julius Caesar was born on July 12 or 13, 100 BC, Subura in Rome http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Caesar-Julius.html#b into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. His father died when he was just 16, leaving Caesar as the head of the household. His family status put him at odds with the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who almost had him executed. At about that time, Caesar found himself captured by pirates, only to crucify his former captors after he was ransomed. Soon he began his military career. He served in Hispania, married Sulla's granddaughter and was elected chief priest, all in rapid succession. Shortly after this, he was suspected, though not convicted, of involvement in the Catiline Conspiracy. Soon he was leaving for a governorship in Hispania and positioning himself to be one of the most important figures in history.

See also: Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars: Julius 6 ; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.41; Virgil, Aeneid The cognomen \\"Caesar\\" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, caedere, caes-).Pliny the Elder, Natural History 7.7. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (Suda kappa 1199). Julius was not the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived long after he was born. The Historia Augusta suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin caesaries); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin oculis caesiis); or that he killed an elephant (' in Moorish) in battle.Historia Augusta: Aelius 2. Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favoured this interpretation of his name. Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, having produced only three consuls. Caesar's father, also called Gaius Julius Caesar, reached the rank of praetor, the second highest of the Republic's elected magistracies, and governed the province of Asia, perhaps through the influence of his prominent brother-in-law Gaius Marius.Suetonius, Julius 1 ; Plutarch, Caesar 1, Marius 6; Pliny the Elder, Natural History 7.54; Inscriptiones Italiae, 13.3.51‚Äì52 His mother, Aurelia Cotta, came from an influential family which had produced several consuls. Marcus Antonius Gnipho, an orator and grammarian of Gaulish origin, was employed as Caesar's tutor.Suetonius, Lives of Eminent Grammarians 7 Caesar had two older sisters, known as Julia Major and Julia Minor. Little else is recorded of Caesar's childhood. Suetonius and Plutarch's biographies of him both begin abruptly in Caesar's teens; the opening paragraphs of both appear to be lost.Plutarch, Caesar 1; Suetonius, Julius 1 The Marius-Sulla civil war Caesar's formative years were a time of turmoil, and \\"savage bloodshed\\". The Social War was fought from 91 to 88 BC between Rome and her Italian allies over the issue of Roman citizenship, while Mithridates of Pontus threatened Rome's eastern provinces. Domestically, Roman politics was divided between politicians known as optimates and populares. The optimates tended to be more conservative,Greenblatt, Miriam. 2005. Julius Caesar and the Roman Republic. P.10 defended the interests of the upper classMackay, Christopher S. Ancient Rome: a military and political history. P.171Shapiro, Susan O. 2005. O tempora!

Mass oratory and political power in the late Roman Republic. P.204-205 the populares advocated reform in the interests of the masses and used and promoted the authority of the Popular Assemblies. These were not official political parties, but were instead loose confederations of like-minded individuals who would often switch sides. Caesar's uncle Gaius Marius was a popularis, Marius' prot√©g√© Lucius Cornelius Sulla was an optimas, and in Caesar's youth their rivalry led to civil war. Both Marius and Sulla distinguished themselves in the Social War, and both wanted command of the war against Mithridates, which was initially given to Sulla; but when Sulla left the city to take command of his army, a tribune passed a law transferring the appointment to Marius. Sulla responded by marching his army on Rome (the first time ever this happened and an influence for Caesar in his later career as he contemplated crossing the Rubicon), reclaiming his command and forcing Marius into exile, but when he left on campaign Marius returned at the head of a makeshift army. He and his ally Lucius Cornelius Cinna seized the city and declared Sulla a public enemy, and Marius's troops took violent revenge on Sulla's supporters. Marius died early in 86 BC, but his followers remained in power.Appian, Civil Wars 1.34‚Äì75; Plutarch, Marius 32‚Äì46, Sulla 6‚Äì10; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.15‚Äì20; Eutropius 5; Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.6, 2.9 In 85 BC Caesar's father died suddenly while putting on his shoes one morning, without any apparent cause,Suetonius, Julius 1 ; Pliny the Elder, Natural History 7.54 and at sixteen, Caesar was the head of the family. The following year he was nominated to be the new Flamen Dialis, high priest of Jupiter, as Merula, the previous incumbent, had died in Marius's purges.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.22; Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.9 Since the holder of that position not only had to be a patrician but also be married to a patrician, he broke off his engagement to Cossutia, a plebeian girl of wealthy equestrian family he had been betrothed to since boyhood, and married Cinna's daughter Cornelia.Suetonius, Julius 1 ; Plutarch, Caesar 1; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.41 Then, having brought Mithridates to terms, Sulla returned to finish the civil war against Marius' followers. After a campaign throughout Italy he seized Rome at the Battle of the Colline Gate in November 82 BC and had himself appointed to the revived office of dictator; but whereas a dictator was traditionally appointed for six months at a time, Sulla's appointment had no term limit. Statues of Marius were destroyed and Marius' body was exhumed and thrown in the Tiber. Cinna was already dead, killed by his own soldiers in a mutiny.Appian, Civil Wars 1.76‚Äì102; Plutarch, Sulla 24‚Äì33; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.23‚Äì28; Eutropius, Abridgement of Roman History 5; Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.9 Sulla's proscriptions saw hundreds of his political enemies killed or exiled. Caesar, as the nephew of Marius and son-in-law of Cinna, was targeted. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar. Military service Gaius Marius, Caesar's uncle Feeling it much safer to be far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, Caesar quit Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the siege of Mytilene. On a mission to Bithynia to secure the assistance of King Nicomedes' fleet, he spent so long at his court that rumours of an affair with the king Nicomedes arose.Suetonius, Julius 2‚Äì3 ; Plutarch, Caesar 2‚Äì3; Cassius Dio, Roman History 43.20 The loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career: the Flamen Dialis was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities: Flamen Return to Rome In 79 BC, Sulla resigned his dictatorship, re-established consular government and, after serving as consul in 80 BC, retired to private life.Appian. Civil Wars 1.103 In a manner that the historian Suetonius thought arrogant, Julius Caesar would later mock Sulla for resigning the Dictatorship‚Äî\\"Sulla did not know his political ABC's\\".Suetonius, Julius 77 . He died later in 78 BC and was accorded a state funeral.Plutarch, Sulla 36‚Äì38 Hearing of Sulla's death, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. Lacking means since his inheritance was confiscated, he acquired a modest house in the Subura, a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome.Suetonius, Julius 46 His return coincided with an attempted anti-Sullan coup by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus but Caesar, lacking confidence in Lepidus's leadership, did not participate.Suetonius, Julius 3 ; Appian, Civil Wars 1.107 Instead he turned to legal advocacy. He became known for his exceptional oratory, accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption. Even Cicero praised him: \\"Come now, what orator would you rank above him...?\\"Suetonius, Julius 55 Aiming at rhetorical perfection, Caesar travelled to Rhodes in 75 BC to study under Apollonius Molon, who had previously taught Cicero.Suetonius, Julius 4 . Plutarch (Caesar 3‚Äì4) reports the same events but follows a different chronology. Kidnapping by pirates On the way across the Aegean Sea,Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (Julius 4 ). Plutarch (Caesar 1.8‚Äì2) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (Roman History 2:41.3‚Äì42) says merely that it happened when he was a young man. Caesar was kidnapped by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa.Plutarch, Caesar 1‚Äì2 He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. While held captive for a period of thirty-eight days he would participate in his captors' games, exercise alongside them, and order them to be silent when they were loud. During this time, Caesar also wrote poems and practiced his public speaking. He read his prose out loud to the pirates, flatly calling them illiterate barbarians if his work was not appreciated. The pirates were greatly entertained by his arrogance, which they attributed to the young man's age.http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Caesar-Julius.html#b When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty talents of gold, he insisted they ask for fifty.Freeman, 39 After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them in Pergamon. Marcus Junctus, the governor of Asia, refused to execute them as Caesar demanded, preferring to sell them as slaves,Freeman, 39‚Äì40 but Caesar returned to the coast and had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivityFreeman, 40‚Äîa promise the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He then proceeded to Rhodes, but was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of auxiliaries to repel an incursion from Pontus. Caesar begins a political career Mithridates VI of Pontus. On his return to Rome he was elected military tribune, a first step on the cursus honorum of Roman politics. The war against Spartacus took place around this time (73‚Äì71 BC), but it is not recorded what role, if any, Caesar played in it. He was elected quaestor for 69 BC,Freeman, 51 and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, widow of Marius, and included images of Marius, unseen since the days of Sulla, in the funeral procession. His own wife Cornelia also died that year.Freeman, 52 After her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC, Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Hispania under Antistius Vetus.Goldsworthy, 100 While there he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. He requested, and was granted, an early discharge from his duties, and returned to Roman politics. On his return in 67 BC,Goldsworthy, 101 he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla.Suetonius, Julius 5‚Äì8 ; Plutarch, Caesar 5; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.43 He was curator of the Appian Way in 66 BC and after taking out massive loans began a reconstruction project of the ancient road. This was a gamble as it placed him in early debt but allowed voters traveling to the city to see the work he had done. He was elected aedile and restored the trophies of Marius's victories; a controversial move given the Sullan regime was still in place. He also brought prosecutions against men who had benefited from Sulla's proscriptions, and spent a great deal of borrowed money on public works and games, outshining his colleague Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. He was also suspected of involvement in two abortive coup attempts.Suetonius, Julius 9‚Äì11 ; Plutarch, Caesar 5.6‚Äì6; Cassius Dio, Roman History 37.8, 10 63 BC: Caesar comes to prominence =The trial of Gaius Rabirius= Bust of Caesar from the Naples National Archaeological Museum. In 63 a tribune, Titus Labienus, prosecuted the elderly optimate senator Gaius Rabirius for the killing, 37 years previously, of the populist tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, who had been declared a public enemy by the Senate after a candidate for the consulship had been murdered during an election. Caesar was one of the two judges, and Suetonius says he had bribed Labienus to bring the prosecution.Suetonius, Julius 12 The charge was the archaic offence of perduellio, a form of treason, the punishment for which was crucifixion.Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: The Life of a Colossus, 2006 Rabirius was defended by Quintus Hortensius, who argued that he had not killed Saturninus, and Cicero, who argued that the killing of Saturninus was lawful as it had been done under the senatus consultum ultimum, a declaration of a state of emergency which authorised the consuls to do whatever it took to protect the Republic.Cicero, For Gaius Rabirius Rabirius was convicted, and exercised his right of appeal to the people. During his appeal, a procedural technicality was contrived - the praetor Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer took down the military flag from the Janiculum hill, indicating foreign invasion - and proceedings were adjourned. The prosecution was never resumed. The purpose of the trial is obscure, but it has been interpreted as a challenge to the use of the senatus consultum ultimum. Cassius Dio characterises it as a populist attack on the authority of the Senate.Cassius Dio, Roman History 26‚Äì28 Labienus would remain an important ally of Caesar over the next decade, and served under him during the Gallic wars. =Pontifex Maximus= The same year, Caesar ran for election to the post of Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the Roman state religion, after the death of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, who had been appointed to the post by Sulla. He ran against two powerful optimates, the former consuls Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. There were accusations of bribery by all sides. Caesar is said to have told his mother on the morning of the election that he would return as Pontifex Maximus or not at all, expecting to be forced into exile by the enormous debts he had run up to fund his campaign. He won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing, possibly because the two older men split their votes.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.43; Plutarch, Caesar 7; Suetonius, Julius 13 The post came with an official residence on the Via Sacra. =The conspiracy of Catiline= When Cicero, who was consul that year, exposed Catiline's conspiracy to seize control of the republic, Catulus and others accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.Sallust, Catiline War 49 Caesar, who had been elected praetor for the following year, took part in the debate in the Senate on how to deal with the conspirators. During the debate, Caesar was passed a note. Marcus Porcius Cato, who would become his most implacable political opponent, accused him of corresponding with the conspirators, and demanded that the message be read aloud. Caesar passed him the note, which, embarrassingly, turned out to be a love letter from Cato's half-sister Servilia.Cicero, Against Catiline 4.7‚Äì9; Sallust, Catiline War 50‚Äì55; Plutarch, Caesar 7.5‚Äì8.3, Cicero 20‚Äì21, Cato the Younger 22‚Äì24; Suetonius, Julius 14 Caesar argued persuasively against the death penalty for the conspirators, proposing life imprisonment instead, but a speech by Cato proved decisive, and the conspirators were executed. The following year a commission was set up to investigate the conspiracy, and Caesar was again accused of complicity. On Cicero's evidence that he had reported what he knew of the plot voluntarily, however, he was cleared, and one of his accusers, and also one of the commissioners, were sent to prison.Suetonius, Julius 17 62 BC: Scandal =Praetorship= While praetor in 62 BC, Caesar supported Metellus Nepos, now tribune, in proposing controversial legislation that would recall Pompey and his army in order to quell the rising disorder in Italy.p173, Caesar, Goldsworthy However, the pair were so obstinate in their proposals that they were suspended from office by the Senate. Caesar attempted to continue to perform his duties, only giving way when violence was threatened. The Senate was persuaded to reinstate him after he quelled public demonstrations in his favour.Suetonius, Julius 16 =The Bona Dea Scandal= That year the festival of the Bona Dea (\\"good goddess\\") was held at the domus publicus, Caesar's residence as pontifex maximus. No men were permitted to attend, but a young patrician named Publius Clodius Pulcher managed to gain admittance disguised as a woman, apparently for the purpose of seducing Caesar's wife Pompeia. He was caught and prosecuted for sacrilege. Caesar gave no evidence against Clodius at his trial, careful not to offend one of the most powerful patrician families of Rome, and Clodius was acquitted after rampant bribery and intimidation. Nevertheless, Caesar divorced Pompeia, saying that \\"the wife of Caesar must be above suspicion.\\"Cicero, Letters to Atticus 1.12, 1.13, 1.14; Plutarch, Caesar 9‚Äì10; Cassius Dio, Roman History 37.45 61 BC: Governorship in Hispania After his praetorship, Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior (Outer Iberia), but he was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of Rome's richest men. In return for political support in his opposition to the interests of Pompey, Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Hispania he conquered the Callaici and Lusitani, being hailed as imperator by his troops, reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.Plutarch, Caesar 11‚Äì12; Suetonius, Julius 18.1 60 BC: Campaign for the Consulship By the time Caesar returned to Rome mid-year in 60 BC, the senate had granted him the title of imperator, a title which entitled him to a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand in absentia, but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.Plutarch, Julius 13; Suetonius, Julius 18.2 See also *Julius Caesar (main article) *Ancient Rome *Caesar, Life of a Colossus a 2006 biography *The Roman Empire *The Roman Republic References External links *C.

After two years of law firm practice, she moved to Chicago, Illinois where she continued practicing law. During this time, she began volunteer tutoring and seeking creative ways to engage her students. She then wrote several children's picture book manuscripts and worked with a marketing firm creating web strategies.  Career as a creator  She is best known for her creation and distribution of the Kids Across Parents Down (KAPD) family crossword series. Dubbed \\"The Original Crossword Puzzle for Kids and Their Favorite Adults,\\" the collaborative puzzles are distributed weekly through Tribune Media Services and feature across clues for children and down clues for parents. All of the puzzles center on a lively and contemporary theme familiar to children and intriguing to parents with an eye toward fostering both family interaction and literacy. The series are primarily freeform style crosswords that focus on clever word play and quirky humor over the classic academic rigor of American-style (or newspaper‚Äìstyle crosswords), so a children's clue might be \\"What do you get when a cow dances?\\" (9 letters) (Answer: MILKSHAKE) while for adults a clue might be \\"What you find on the outside of every Will Smith compact disc\\" (7 letters) (Answer: RAPPER). Since its first appearance in 2003 in The Washington Posts Kids Post, versions of the crosswords have been picked up by several publications, including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Detroit Free Press, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. Family Magazine and Jack and Jill Magazine. In 2007, the puzzles spawned a book series, launching with two titles to date, Crazy Critters and On the Go and also provides puzzle content for kids menus and other programs offered by various family-friendly venues, such as Cracker Barrel and McDonald's restaurants. Buckner Walker has also created billboard-size puzzles for the annual Los Angeles Times Book Festival held at University of California, Los Angeles and at events sponsored by the Boston Celtics. In 2009, Buckner Walker launched Kids Across Teachers Down, a classroom version which extended the collaborative learning formula into schools. First published online at www.chicagotribune.com, the crossword encourages competition and collaboration with class vs. classroom and school vs. school tournaments. Buckner Walker has also produced a number of other family activity brands, including First Letter Fun (a picture-based crossword puzzle for new and pre-readers) and Blackout (a multi-level puzzle slated for a book series and smart phone applications). Buckner Walker is also well known for her creation of ethnic-oriented general interest crosswords for magazines such as Essence, Ebony and Rise Up. Previously, none of these publications had offered crosswords and, as such, she is credited with generating a groundswell of interest in crossword puzzles among members of the African-American community. In 2010 Buckner Walker created UnhappenIt, dubbed \\"The Apology App,\\" which provides users a quick and easy way to apologize online or via the Android smart phone, offering proposed language, recommended downloadable songs and various gifts to express a message apology. With its integration with Facebook and Twitter, the application also allows members to see and rank the apologies of others and to suggest songs for inclusion in the music database. Since its launch, the term \\"unhappen\\" has gained a viral momentum in social media and elsewhere and has been used by various journalists, media personalities and others in reference to one's desire to go back in time before an unfortunate occurrence.  Awards  Kids Across Parents Down was awarded the Mr. Dad Seal of Approval and has been recognized by Fast Company as a \\"Rising Star\\" in its Fast 50 Companies competition.

His father, John Thomas Hudson, was a British ship chandler and ironmonger. His mother, Suzanne D√©sir√©e Marcos, was a free New Orleans quadroon. Hudson's racial identity had been a matter of scrutiny for some years. He is first listed in the city directory in 1838 without the designation of \\"free man of color.\\" The following year, \\"f.m.c.\\" was included. Hudson's father apparently did not live with the family after 1822, but his mother had investments in real estate and had a steady income. Hudson may have been educated at home on Bienville Street near Bourbon Street. Within the family, Julien was known by the nickname \\"Pickil.\\" After a two-year apprenticeship to tailor Erasme Logoaster in the mid 1820s, Hudson began working with the husband and wife team of miniature painters Antoine Meucci and Nina Meucci at their studio on the corner of Royal and St. Peters Streets. Julien Hudson's apprenticeship with the Meuccis (1826-1827) lasted less than six months, as the Meuccis left New Orleans for Cuba, and later Bogota, Colombia. In 1829, Hudson's grandmother, Fran√ßoise Leclerc, left him at least $100 of a $7,000 estate that included three slaves. Little is known of Hudson's activities until June 1831, when he advertised in The New Orleans Bee that he had undergone a \\"complete course of studies\\" with Antoine Meucci. In August, Hudson applied for a passport to sail to Liverpool, and by December informed readers of The Louisiana Courier that he \\"lately had returned from Paris.\\" With whom he studied during this trip is not known. Hudson traveled again to Paris to study, presumably with neoclassical painter Alexandre-Denis Abel de Pujol (1785-1861), a student of Jacques-Louis David and winner of the Prix de Rome in 1811. Hudson's second trip may have begun in 1835 and by August 16, 1837, he was back in New Orleans.\\"In Search of Julien Hudson: Free Artist of Color in Pre‚ÄìCivil War New Orleans\\". The Historic New Orleans Collection. Hudson's return was most probably prompted by the financial Panic of 1837, which began on May 10, as well as by the death of his sisters. After returning to New Orleans, Hudson opened his own studio on 120 Bienville Street in 1831, though he appears in city directories as an artist only in the years 1837‚Äì1838. For a brief time in 1840, Hudson had a student, George David Coulon (1822-1904). Julien Hudson died in 1844 in New Orleans.

He was born in Burgos (Spain) and studied Journalism, Politics and Sociology in Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Vicente Bot√≠n started in the news media predominately about International Politics, concentrating on Latin America. In 1971 he travelled across the entire continent as an on-the-scene reporter for different broadcast Media; he was one of the first Spanish journalists, while in Chile, to interview President Salvador Allende. In 1972 he reported for the Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola (TVE) on significant events of that time in: France, United Kingdom, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco and Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, his major works were about Latin America: In the 60's he made documentaries in Nicaragua (Sandinismo y Contra), El Salvador (civil war), Paraguay (coup d'√©tat against Alfredo Stroessner), Cuba (he enterviewd Fidel Castro), Ecuador (amazon rainforest), Haiti (first triumph of Jean Bertrand Aristide), and Brasil, Guatemala, Per√∫, Chile and Honduras. In coproduction between Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola and UNHCR he film the documentary ‚ÄúDuro oficio el exilio‚Äù, about the drama of Central America refugees. Later, he was the director of En Portada, long-running documentary program of TVE. The most representative episode was ‚ÄúEl descubrimiento de la lentitud‚Äù, filmed aboard a replica of the Santa Mar√≠a Caravel on a voyage made in the same conditions experienced by Crist√≥bal Col√≥n when he landed in the Americas. He also continued his news reporting activities from various places in the world. From 1999 to 2004 he was the correspondent in Buenos Aires (Argentina) for Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola; he reported on stories throughout South America. He made many reports and documentaries about the Argentinian crisis caused by the fall of the President Fernando de la R√∫a, the deaths caused by starvation of the children of Tucum√°n; the various issues resulting from the trial of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, the problems in Bolivia related to the coca crop and the new Brazil president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. From 2005 to 2008 he was the correspondent in Cuba for Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola. He was threatened and pressured by the government while reporting which included stories on Human Rights, political opposition groups, the health of Fidel Castro and the possible turn over of government to his brother, Ra√∫l Castro. He also did reports for other Spanish language media radio and print. When he finished as a correspondent in Cuba he wrote, ‚ÄúLos funerales de Castro‚Äù about the difficult situation of the Cubans and ‚ÄúRa√∫l Castro: La pulga que cabalg√≥ al tigre‚Äù, a comprehensive biography of Ra√∫l Castro. Vicente Botin is a columnist of the Spanish newspapers El Pa√≠s, El Mundo and others. He lectures in Spain and the United States about the social, economical and political situation of Cuba: in Casa de Am√©rica, in Madrid and Columbia University in New York, Seton Hall in New Jersey; and also for the United Nations (invited by the United Nations Correspondents Association).

He is known as the possible identity of a man appearing in a 1936 photograph, conspicuously refusing to perform the Nazi salute with the other workers.Simone Erpel: Zivilcourage : Schl√ºsselbild einer unvollendeten \\"Volksgemeinschaft\\". In: Gerhard Paul (Hrsg.): Das Jahrhundert der Bilder, Bd. 1: 1900‚Äì1949, G√∂ttingen 2009, pp. 490‚Äì497, . Landmesser had run afoul of the Nazi Party over his unlawful relationship with Irma Eckler, a Jewish woman. Later, he was imprisoned and eventually, he was drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action. Biography August Landmesser was born in Moorrege in 1910, the only child of August Franz Landmesser and Wilhelmine Magdalene (n√©e Schmidtpott). In 1931, hoping it would help him get employment, he joined the Nazi Party. In 1935, when he became engaged to Irma Eckler (a Jewish woman), he was expelled from the party. They registered to be married in Hamburg, but the Nuremberg Laws enacted a month later prevented it. On 29 October 1935, Landmesser and Eckler's first daughter, Ingrid, was born. In 1937, Landmesser and Eckler tried to flee to Denmark, but were apprehended. She was pregnant again, which led to his being charged and found guilty in July 1937 of \\"dishonoring the race\\" under Nazi racial laws. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew whether she was fully Jewish. He was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence. The couple publicly continued their relationship, and on 15 July 1938, he was arrested again and sentenced to two and a half years in the B√∂rgermoor concentration camp. Eckler was detained by the Gestapo and held at the prison Fuhlsb√ºttel, where she gave birth to their second daughter, Irene. From there Eckler was sent to the Oranienburg concentration camp, then to the Lichtenburg concentration camp for women, and next, to the women's concentration camp at Ravensbr√ºck. A few letters from Irma Eckler were received until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 murdered. In the course of post-war documentation, in 1949, she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942. Meanwhile, Landmesser was discharged from prison on 19 January 1941. He worked as a foreman for the haulage company P√ºst. The company had a branch at the Heinkel-Werke (factory) in Warnem√ºnde. In February 1944 he was drafted into a penal battalion, the 999th Fort Infantry Battalion. After fighting in Croatia on 17 October 1944, he was declared killed in action. Like Eckler, he was declared legally dead in 1949. Initially, their children were taken to the city orphanage. Later, Ingrid was allowed to live with her maternal grandmother. In 1941, Irene went to the home of foster parents. After her grandmother's death in 1953, Ingrid also was placed with foster parents. The marriage of August Landmesser and Irma Eckler was recognized retroactively by the Senate of Hamburg in the summer of 1951. In the autumn of that year Ingrid assumed the surname Landmesser. Irene continued to use the surname Eckler. Recognition A figure identified as August Landmesser by Irene Eckler is visible in a photograph taken on 13 June 1936, which was published on 22 March 1991 in Die Zeit. It shows a large gathering of workers at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the launching of the navy training ship Horst Wessel. Almost everyone in the image has raised their arm in the Nazi salute, with the most obvious exception of a man toward the back of the crowd, who grimly stands with his arms crossed over his chest. In 1996, Irene Eckler published Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935‚Äì1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen \\"Rassenschande\\" (The Guardianship Documents 1935‚Äì1958: Persecution of a Family for \\"Racial Disgrace\\").

The identity of the man in the photograph is not known with certainty. Several historians side with another family's claims that the man is Gustav Wegert (1890‚Äì1959), a metalworker at Blohm+Voss who habitually refused to salute on religious grounds. They have presented documentation of Wegert's employment at Blohm+Voss at that time which advocates take as stronger evidence, as well as family photographs that better resemble the man in the famous photograph, as evidence.Gerhard Paul, Das Jahrhundert der Bilder 1900 bis 1949, Verlag Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht 2009, Seite 494 rechte Spalte Absatz 3), as quoted in . Quote: \\"In the meantime another Family from Hamburg has identified the man as a relative. It should be Gustav Wegert (1890‚Äì1959) who worked as a metalworker at Blohm & Voss. As a believing Christian he generally refused the Nazi Salute. Despite his distance to the Nazi Regime Gustav Wegert did not get in the eye of the Nazi persecution administration. Portraits from Wegert and Landmesser prove in both cases great similarity with the worker on that picture. At this time it has to remain unsettled who the man in the picture is‚Äú.

It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places by its original name, the Hotel Mississippi-RKO Orpheum Theater. The Hotel Mississippi was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 2005. In 2020 the complex was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. Hotel Mississippi-RKO Orpheum Theater The Davenport Block (c. 1915) on the left where the Mississippi Lofts and Adler Theatre stand today. The Hotel Mississippi was the last large-scale hotel to be built in the third phase of hotel construction in downtown Davenport after the Davenport Hotel in 1909 and the Hotel Blackhawk in 1915. The hotel and theater were designed by A.S. Graven of the Chicago architectural firm of Graven & Mayger. Henry Dreyfuss of New York City, an art consultant for the RKO chain, was involved with the theater but it's not exactly clear how. Contemporary accounts suggest he \\"was to provide an aesthetic sensibility and theatrical functionality to the theater derived from his years as a theatrical set designer.\\" with Its developer, George Bechtel, organized one of the first investment bond houses in Iowa in 1891. It specialized in buying and selling municipal bonds. He was able secure the means for the construction of the hotel during the Great Depression. The complex was built by the Lundoff- Bicknell Company. It is situated on the site that was occupied by the Davenport Block, a commercial block built by Col. George Davenport, one of the founders of the city of Davenport and its namesake. The hotel opened in November 1931 with 200 guest rooms and 50 apartments. It was initially operated by the Black Hawk Hotels Corporation of Davenport. The hotel struggled financially in the 1930s with an occupancy rate of about 25%. The hotel's restaurant and kitchen were located in the basement. Businesses such as a coffee shop, drug store, a clothier, realtor, floral shop and a beauty salon have been housed on the first floor over the years. By the 1970s the complex was owned by the Verdi Corporation, which was owned by prominent local realtor Mel Foster, Jr. and contractor Dudley Priester. The Mel Foster Company had its corporate headquarters in the building until the 1980s in what had been a Walgreens drug store location. By the early 1980s, the building had been converted into an apartment building. During this time period the local chamber of commerce leased space on the first floor of the building. The RKO Orpheum Theater was a 2,700-seat theater that was built at the same time as the hotel, which surrounds the theater to the south and west. It was one of five RKO Orpheum Theaters to open that year. It was also Iowa's largest movie house. The theater featured then up-to-date cinema equipment and a fully equipped stage that could accommodate vaudeville shows, concerts, and Broadway roadshow productions. The planned pipe organ, however, was never installed. Its grand opening was held on November 25, 1931, with Ginger Rogers sending a telegram from Hollywood to begin the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Her movie, Suicide Fleet, and five vaudeville acts accompanied by the theater's house orchestra were the opening night entertainment. Because of its size and modern facilities, the Orpheum became the Tri Cities cinema showplace, and it hosted all of Hollywood's major releases. Entertainers such as Tallulah Bankhead, Paul Robeson, Imogene Coca, Dorothy Lamour, Phil Ford, Forrest Tucker, John Barrymore, Liberace, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey, Jack Benny, Sammy Cahn, Phyllis Diller, Jimmy Dean, Stan Kenton, The Beach Boys, Sonny & Cher, The Supremes, and The Pointer Sisters performed in the theater live. The original ticket booth and seven display advertising cases remain in place at the main entrance. =Architecture= Adler Theatre Lobby detail The hotel portion of the facility is a ten-story L-shaped brick and granite building surrounding the seven-story theater. The ten-story portion of the building is high. Three passenger elevators provided access to the upper floors. All of the hotel rooms faced out from the outside of the \\"L.\\" There were no interior facing rooms. The verticality of the building is established by way of the vertically aligned windows that are separated by decorative panels. The Art Deco style is employed throughout the building, including the theater interior. Overall, the fa√ßade is void of excessive ornamentation. However, the stylized geometry indicative of the Art Deco style is found on the horizontal banding that defines the tenth floor. Decorative terracotta panels with a floral motif are also used to define the mezzanine level of the lower stories.Svendsen, 6-10 The theater's two-story grand lobby features a ceiling that rises to about , a grand staircase, and a mezzanine to access the balcony seats. Mirrored openings and curved edge pseudo balconies on the east wall of the lobby match the real balconies and openings on the west side. The lobby ceiling is a series of recessed stepped pyramid openings that are arranged in a large rectangular panel. Two large chandeliers with crystal strands form geometric patterns that are consistent with the theater's Art Deco style. Mississippi Lofts and Adler Theatre The Adler Theatre can be seen just behind Mississippi Lofts and the RiverCenter The theater had deteriorated over the years and by the 1970s the RKO Orpheum was rarely being used because of its large size and the advent of multiplex movie theaters. The last movie shown in the theater was Cleopatra Jones on September 11, 1973. The theater was used on occasion for road shows and rock concerts. In 1981, an effort began to restore the theater. The Davenport Chamber of Commerce bought the theater and donated it to the RiverCenter For The Performing Arts, a non-profit group that was established to raise money to restore the theater and operate it as a performing arts center. The theater restoration project lasted from 1985 to 1986. The Davenport architectural firm of Scholtz-Kuehn and Paul S. Veneklasen, an acoustics consultant from Santa Monica, California were responsible for the plans. The project included restoring the original crystal and glass chandeliers and rebuilding and reupholstering the original seats. New carpeting was reproduced in England using a roll of the original floral woolen carpeting that was found during the remodeling project. The renovated theater is a part of the adjacent convention center complex called the RiverCenter that opened in fall 1983. The convention center connects the Adler Theatre with the Hotel Blackhawk. A passageway with a new box office connects the theater and convention center at the theater's entresol. It was at this time that the theater was renamed the Adler Theatre after E.P. Adler and his son Phillip D. Adler. They had been newspaper publishers and philanthropists in Davenport and the decision to rename the theater was based on a $1.3 million endowment from Lee Enterprises, the company they led. The 2018 Adler Theatre marquee. In 2004, the City of Davenport bought the former Hotel Mississippi for $739,000 for the expansion of the Adler Theatre. In autumn 2006, a $10.5 million renovation was completed at the Alder. The theater's stage was expanded from a depth of to into what was the west wing of the hotel. The renovations also included a new loading dock, additional dressing rooms, improved sound and computerized rigging systems. The architect for this renovation was Van Dijk, Westlake, Reed, & Leskosky of Cleveland, Ohio, led by principal architect Paul Westlake. The theater is home to the Quad City Symphony Orchestra, Ballet Quad Cities, and hosts a Broadway tour series annually. At the same time as the theater was being renovated, the Hotel Mississippi was undergoing an $8.5 million renovation. The last tenants were moved out of the old hotel in 2004 and 56 new apartments were created primarily on the south side of the building. The project was completed in spring 2007. J&T; Development LLC of Chicago was in charge of the renovation. In addition to creating new apartments, the lobby area was restored to its past appearance. The project restored its multi-colored terrazzo floors, Art Deco-style elevator doors, and walnut and teak wood paneling. The loft manager's office was created from the hotel's former check-in desk. In November 2010, a new temporary marquee facade was installed above the main entrance of the theater. It replaced one that was installed in 1997, but used its frame. The 2010 marquee was replaced in April 2018 by a new $340,000 structure designed by Michigan architect Eric Larsen and built by Wagner Electric Sign Company of Elyria, Ohio. It features two angled panels with LED screens that advertise upcoming shows, and a vertical blade sign with the theater's name. The inspiration for the new marquee was the theatre's original 1931 RKO Theater marquee. The City of Davenport and private donations paid for the project.

He studied at Seoul University (BFA), graduate student at Miami University, Oxford Ohio 1962, Pratt Institute (MFA), and New York University (Ph. D, Art History). He was also a student of the T'ai Chi grandmaster Cheng Man-ch'ing in New York City. Career as artist =Themes and influences = Ahn's work is greatly influenced by nature, specifically the cycles of nature as in Zen and other Eastern philosophies. Ascribing to the Eastern belief that nature is central to everything that exists, Ahn paints natural forms and environments, which he abstracts into brushstrokes, drips, and splatters. Titles of his paintings reference trees, wind, and water, and include Broken Branch in the Rain, Old Zen Tree, and Wind, Rain, & Ocean. His swirls and drips portray the rapid, random, and untamed effects of natural forces.Don Ahn at the Japanese American National Museum Another influence or concept in Ahn's work is the dragon, a good and powerful figure from Korean and Chinese mythology, whose movements and forms Ahn suggests in whimsical ribbon-like marks and trails of paint. In Korean folk tales, dragons show goodwill to humans by sending clouds and rain, and they tend to live in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Paying tribute to this Folkloric legacy, Ahn's paintings bear titles such as Brown Dragon and Yellow Dragon, as well as titles using names of underwater creatures and habitats, like Phantasy in the Deep Sea. =Style and technique= Ahn's ink and acrylic paintings on canvas are reminiscent of Zen Calligraphy and paintings, with their quick brushstrokes and elegant compositions. Composed of swipes and spatters that course across the pictorial field, these works blend Eastern brush painting with Abstract Expressionist \\"action painting.\\"Review in The New York Times In his catalog essay, Jeffrey Wechsler remarks at \\"how completely even the most explosive of (the marks) ultimately resolve within the paintings as compositional pivots and Focal points of visual weight, but without reducing their sense of unbound energy\\" which he calls a \\"zen-like paradox.\\" He writes, \\"Somehow, speed becomes the medium for suggesting presence and substance.\\" The white paper background accounts for a large percentage of the surfaces of Ahn's works, but to Ahn, these areas are not characteristic of Western \\"negative space.\\" Instead, as in Eastern Philosophy, empty space or the void is full of Tao (the fullness of existence) and ch'i (the energy within it). =Exhibitions= Ahn has had numerous solo and group exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad, including the solo shows Dragons & Oceans at Ehwa Gallery, Seoul, South Korea in 2007, and Zen & Void at Walter Wickiser Gallery, New York, NY in 2004. His work is in private and public collections, including The Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Dayton Art Museum, Ohio, and the Evansville Museum, Indiana.

On 27 September 2018, the US Air Force selected the Boeing/Saab T-X entry to become its trainer aircraft. The new aircraft was given the designation and name \\"T-7 Red Hawk\\" in September 2019. The Air Force's initial plan is to purchase 351 T-7s, and has an option to purchase up to 475. History A USAF Northrop T-38 Talon from the 560th Flying Training Squadron. The T-38 is to be replaced as the USAF advanced jet trainer by the T-X program winner, the Boeing T-X, now known as the T-7 Red Hawk. The USAF's Air Education and Training Command (AETC) began developing the requirements for a replacement for the Northrop T-38 Talon as early as 2003. The average age of the T-38 fleet is over 50 years, and a fatigue failure in 2008 killed the two-person crew of a T-38C. Originally, the replacement trainer was expected to enter service around 2020, but the Air Force advanced the target date to 2017.... In the Fiscal 2013 budget proposal, the USAF suggested delaying the initial operating capability to FY2020 with the contract award not expected before FY2016. Shrinking budgets and the need to fund higher priority modernization projects pushed the full implementation of the yet-to-be-selected T-X aircraft to \\"fiscal year 2023 or 2024\\". Although the program was left out of the FY 2014 budget entirely, the service still viewed the trainer as a priority.. In February 2013, there was an expectation that the program might succumb to budget pressures in the USAF. In May 2013, the T-X industry day was postponed \\"until further notice\\" due to the fiscal climate.. In December 2013 the head of the program said there were no plans for 2014 or 2015, but that he would speak to the chief of staff about the program either in February 2014 or later. On 20 March 2015, the US Air Force released the T-X program requirements.. On 30 December 2016, the US Air Force released a formal request for proposals. The request includes 350 aircraft and initial operational capability by 2024. . On 27 September 2018, the U.S. Air Force officially selected the Boeing T-X entry as its new advanced jet trainer to replace the T-38... Requirements One of the driving requirements for the new trainer will be to help prepare pilots for the increased complexity in some areas, particularly information management, that are a part of fifth generation jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. The Air Force first viewed this as unnecessary and costly, but industry analysis showed it to be cheaper in the long run. The aircraft and simulation system will have to fulfill several basic training roles; basic aircraft control, airmanship, formation, instrument and navigation, advanced air-to-air, advanced air-to- ground, and advanced crew/cockpit resource management. Furthermore, there are five advanced training roles that the system is expected to fulfill; sustained high-G operations at 6.5‚Äì7.5g, aerial refueling, night vision imaging systems operations, air-to-air intercepts, and data-link operations. The 2009 Request For Information (RFI) mentions that some tasks, such as aerial refueling, may be performed in the simulator and not on the aircraft itself.. Aircraft availability is to be 80%, but not higher, as that would drive cost too high. Program requirements focus on life-cycle costs rather than just purchase price. Additionally, while the RFI is specifically for a USAF trainer, it asked potential suppliers about the feasibility of a fighter/attack variant of the aircraft and a carrier-capable variant for the United States Navy. However, the requirements manager for the program, Stephan Lyon, has stated that it is unlikely that potential combat performance will be considered. Similarly, while Navy officials will be participating in some stages of the program, carrier suitability will not be part of the evaluation. Similarly, the Air Force considered the possibility of adapting the T-X aircraft to perform light attack and close air support as part of their effort to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II. With the T-X already invested in, making it a multirole combat and training plane could defray costs of developing a new attack jet that can operate efficiently in a low-threat environment.Amid Pressure To Keep A-10 Alive, USAF Explores Close-Air Support's Future ‚Äì Militarytimes.com, 25 August 2015 However, by 2016 the Air Force decided to pursue other aircraft to meet CAS requirements and not \\"dilute\\" the trainer program to support other missions.USAF seeks two new close-air support aircraft ‚Äì Flightglobal.com, 24 July 2016 Competitors Several competitors submitted existing aircraft and others proposed all new designs. The following were submitted as bids:https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/27/2017-the- year-the-air-force-picks-its-new-plane.aspx Leonardo S.p.A. with the M-346-based T-100,http://www.ainonline.com/aviation- news/defense/2017-02-13/leonardo-stays-running-us-air-force-t-x-program Korea Aerospace Industries/Lockheed Martin with the T-50 Golden Eagle, Boeing and Saab Group new, purpose-built Boeing T-X, and Sierra Nevada Corporation and Turkish Aerospace Industries with a new design. =Boeing / Saab T-X /T-7 Red Hawk= On 6 December 2013, Boeing and Saab Group announced they would team up to offer a new aircraft (Boeing T-X) for the T-X program. On 22 August 2016, Boeing publicly revealed first pictures of the T-X concept. The single-engine, twin-tail aircraft was presented to the public on 13 September. The aircraft was first flown on 20 December 2016. =Leonardo T-100= T-100 at the Farnborough Airshow in 2018 Italian aerospace company Leonardo S.p.A. (formerly Alenia Aermacchi) is part of a bid with its M-346 Master. The company had initially considered submitting the aircraft as the prime contractor, but changed its mind in 2010. The company is offering a variant of the aircraft as the \\"Leonardo DRS T-100 Integrated Training System\\" for the competition. Alenia anticipates moving the final assembly location from Italy to the United States if it wins the competition. In January 2013, General Dynamics joined Alenia Aermacchi and signed a letter of intent (LOI) to compete jointly on the program.. In February 2014, CAE Inc., which specializes in flight simulators and flight training, joined General Dynamics and Alenia Aermacchi to offer the T-100 for the T-X program.. On 26 March 2015, General Dynamics withdrew as the prime contractor for the M-346 Master/T-100 offering. General Dynamics would no longer retain its role as the lead contractor and systems integrator for the bid.. Alenia Aermacchi which had been a subsidiary to a holding company Finmeccanica, was taken over completely on 1 January 2016 and renamed Leonardo in 2017. On 22 February 2016, Raytheon announced it was replacing General Dynamics and going to head-up the bid in the US for the T-X program, as the primary contractor, teamed with Leonardo, Honeywell Aerospace, and CAE USA Inc. The aircraft to be submitted would be a modified M-346 platform, named T-100, using two Honeywell/ITEC F124 low-bypass turbofan engines.. On January 25, 2017, Raytheon announced its withdrawal from the T-X program, leaving Leonardo without a partner in the program. On 8 February 2017, Leonardo announced its return to the U.S. Air Force T-X competition, proposing the T-100 with its American subsidiary, Leonardo DRS, as the prime contractor.http://www.defensenews.com/articles/leonardo-goes-it-alone-on-tx- bid Leonardo DRS will be supported by CAE USA in the design and development of the T-100 Ground-Based Training System (GBTS). Honeywell will also provide twin F124 turbofan propulsion engines. The aircraft is to be built at a new 750-employee manufacturing facility at Moton Field in Tuskegee, Alabama. =Lockheed Martin / KAI T-50 Golden Eagle= T-50 Golden Eagle Lockheed Martin with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) proposed their KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, which first flew in 2002, for the T-X program. While the T-50 was explicitly designed and built for the South Korean trainer requirement, Lockheed Martin officials acknowledged that the aircraft was designed with replacing the T-38 in mind. Hence, the Defense Department reserved the T-50A designation for the KAI T-50 in hopes of not creating confusion between two \\"T-50\\" trainers by allocating T-50 to an unrelated trainer aircraft.http://www.designation- systems.net/usmilav/412015-L(addendum).html#_Note_T50A Lockheed anticipated proposing the T-50 with few changes, mostly avionics related. Plans were in place to build a new assembly line in the United States for manufacturing the T-50 for the United States Air Force instead of manufacturing them in South Korea, should the Lockheed Martin/KAI team win the contract. On 17 December 2015, Lockheed and KAI revealed their T-X prototype in South Korea based on the T-50, the first competitor in the program to do so publicly. Referred to as the \\"T-X demonstrator aircraft\\", it adds to the T-50 airframe the ability for aerial refueling, embedded ground training systems, and a large area display in place of the five smaller screens. South Korean president Park Geun-hye attended the rollout ceremony. Lockheed Martin's upgraded T-50A jet trainer successfully completed its first flight test in Sacheon, South Korea, a key milestone for the aircraft. Flight tests in the U.S. should begin in 2017..... As a line replaceable unit, the aircraft can have an optional large dorsal hump, which houses the aerial refueling receptacle.. =Northrop Grumman / BAE Systems= Northrop Grumman with partners BAE Systems, L-3 Communications, and Rolls-Royce Holdings, initially had intentions of proposing an updated version of the Hawk T2/128 for the T-X program. Northrop Grumman assumed prime responsibilities for the team in 2014. Northrop built the U.S. Air Force's current training aircraft, the T-38 Talon. The Hawk T2 features an all glass cockpit, new wing, and fuselage components. Although the basic Hawk design dates back to the 1970s, the only parts shared between the T1 and T2 versions are the canopy and airbrake, making the T2 version essentially a new aircraft. The Northrop Grumman team was expecting this to be a low-risk, low-cost strategy for the competition, augmented by the fact that Hawk-based McDonnell Douglas/Boeing T-45C Goshawk with glass cockpit is used to train Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers students slated for tactical jet aircraft for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. On 13 September 2013, Rolls-Royce announced it would join the team and provide integration support for its Adour Mk951 engine.. However, in 2015, Northrop Grumman was no longer submitting the Hawk for T-X consideration, primarily due to airframe performance shortcomings with maneuvers such as high angle-of-attack and sustained accelerations, as well as concerns regarding affordability. Instead, Northrop Grumman had begun a new clean-sheet design to closely match the evolving T-X requirements. Scaled Composites, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, was to construct the prototype, with a first flight expected in late 2015. On 19 August 2016 in Mojave, Northrop Grumman publicly revealed a model of its T-X concept powered by a single GE F404-102D engine. The Scaled Composites Model 400 Swift made its first flight on August 26, and six more thereafter; its maximum takeoff weight of was lighter than the Lockheed/KAI T-50A or the M-346-based Leonardo T-100, and 25% heavier than the winning Boeing/Saab design, it had a maximum speed of and a ceiling of . On 1 February 2017, the companies announced they would not submit a proposal for the T-X program. =Sierra Nevada / TAI Freedom= Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) and Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) are also considering offering a new aircraft for the T-X program. based on the TAI Hurjet trainer. The companies have formed the Freedom Aircraft Ventures LLC in Centennial, Colorado to develop a lightweight, all-composite trainer for the competition. =Stavatti Javelin= Stavatti Aerospace announced on 31 March 2017 it submitted the Javelin for the T-X competition. The Javelin is a new single-engine, two-seat, military trainer jet and Very Light Fighter (VLF) aircraft derived from the Aviation Technology Group Javelin Mk-30. =Textron AirLand Scorpion= Textron AirLand Scorpion Textron AirLand, a joint venture between Textron and AirLand Enterprises, developed the Textron AirLand Scorpion light attack jet which had potential as a candidate for the T-X program. Textron management stated that with some modifications, such as swapping the two engines with a single engine and changing the wings, the aircraft would be an ideal match for the T-X role. Additionally, during the Farnborough 2014 Airshow, Textron representatives expressed significant interest in the T-X program, and indicated they were closely following the progression of the draft requirements. On 23 August 2014, Textron AirLand formally confirmed they would compete for the T-X trainer and modify the Scorpion to better fit the training requirements.. However, in September 2015 Textron AirLand revealed it would not offer a version of the Scorpion for the program due to changing Air Force requirements, moving from a low-cost advanced jet trainer requiring little development to a high-performance fly-by-wire trainer with top tier handling qualities. The company stated it was still interested in the T-X, but would have to offer a clean-sheet design like most of the other competitors...

The mission's Japanese name, Midori, means \\"green\\". The mission ended in July 1997 after the satellite sustained structural damage to the solar panel array. Its successor, ADEOS II, was launched in 2002. Like the first mission, it ended after less than a year - also following solar panel malfunctions.  Purpose  ADEOS I satellite ADEOS was designed to observe Earth's environmental changes, focusing on global warming, depletion of the ozone layer, and deforestation. On board the satellite are eight instruments developed by NASDA, NASA, and CNES. The Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) is a whisk broom radiometer developed by NASDA. The Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR), an optoelectronic scanning radiometer with CCD detectors, was also produced by NASDA. The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), developed with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, used fan-beam Doppler signals to measure wind speeds over bodies of water. The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) was built by CNES to study changes to Earth's ozone layer. The Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) device was also developed by CNES, and was also launched on ADEOS II. The Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer (ILAS) was developed by NASDA and the Environment Agency of Japan, and used grating spectrometers to measure the properties of trace gases using solar occultation. The Retroreflector in Space (RIS) and Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases (IMG) were both developed by Japan, and studied atmospheric trace gases and greenhouse gases respectively.  Mission  = Failure = On 28 August 1996, the satellite adjusted its attitude to control its orbit. As a result of this maneuver, the solar panel received sunlight from the rear. This caused the solar paddle mast to expand and the panel blanket to contract, placing tension on a soldered joint on the paddle, which eventually broke. The final communication from the satellite was received at 07:21 UTC on 30 June 1997, 9 months after launch.

It contained details about incidents of violence against civilians and non-combatants (including military personnel and assets outside of war-like settings) from publicly viewable information. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) discontinued WITS in 2012 and was merged into the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which can be downloaded from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) website at the University of Maryland.  Data collection  When collecting data WITS addressed two areas of concern: it practiced basic knowledge management techniques to ensure consistency in data collection and it cast a wider net on political violence than what may be considered terrorism. Casting a wider net ensured all candidate events are given fair consideration. Data was collected in a variety of ways. The NCTC gathered data from open sources manually using commercial subscription news services, the USG's Open Source Center (OSC), local news websites reported in English, and, as permitted by the linguistic capabilities of the team, local news websites reported in foreign languages. Team members on the NCTC read and reviewed each article. A senior intelligence analyst provided quality control over his or her team. The senior analyst reviewed each article to maintain consistency before publishing to the database. To reduce interpretation bias further (or increase inter- rater reliability), NCTC has analysts maintained account notes of commonly used terms and phrases found in the press, recurring political and ethnic issues, terrain notes, weather related trends, and other factors that influence a mastery of context surrounding acts of violence in countries assigned to their area of responsibility. To ensure WITS would give fair and proper consideration to all the events available in open source, WITS collected information on attacks that have any indications of terrorism.  Humans and computers  NCTC designed the WITS data coding process to make the best use of humans and computers. There is evidence to suggest that statistical models based on expert human judgment in older cases tend to outperform the same expert human judgment in newer cases. John Wiggle says, \\"Studies show that humans are good at categorizing and recognizing discrete objects and concepts, but often lack the ability to make effective aggregate judgments.\\" Being able to use humans and computers allows analysts to separate data quickly and effectively to determine what is or is not an act of violence. Analysts can then code them into the database, and the WITS system then made a logical decision on whether the act meets the criteria for terrorism. Having the computer assist NCTC with what is or is not terrorism allowed an analyst to compare the computer‚Äôs answer with human thinking about the attack.

Washington CityPaper, August 27, 2010. History It appears that Lillian Wiggins, a columnist for the Washington Afro American newspaper, was the first to \\"articulate\\" the conspiracy theory. In 1979, she wrote: \\"Many residents believe that the Marion Barry era may be the last time Washington will have a black mayor. If negative programming and characterization of black leadership are allowed to continue in the city of Washington and especially the black community, there is a strong possibility of the 'master plan' which I have so often spoken about maturing in the 1980s.\\" Believers note that the Federal City Council, an organized group of civic and corporate leaders, mostly white, meets in secret and uses its power to influence the city's direction. The theory particularly gained sway in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the city became increasingly unaffordable to low-income minorities. Urban renewal was also seen as intended to push out minority populations.Mikaela Lefrak, \\"Conspiracy theories: Bad for democracy but good for a politician turned novelist\\", Washington Post Magazine, Feb. 10, 2019, pp. 4-6.

It focused on analyzing the Soviet Union and other East European countries before and during the war. Establishment Fremde Heere Ost was established on 10 November 1938 as 12 Department of the General Staff of the Army, attached to the section Senior Quartermaster IV (). It was commanded by Oberstleutnant Eberhard Kinzel from November 1938 to March 1942. Oberstleutnant Reinhard Gehlen replaced Kinzel on 1 April 1942 on the orders of Chief of the General Staff, General Franz Halder, with an initial staffing of about 35 people.Critchfield, p 24 Foreign Armies East was the successor organisation of Department IIIb of the German General Staff, a section since 1889, and only became a department during World War I. During World War I, the department was heavily involved in military intelligence, counter-intelligence and sabotage. Later as it developed, it became involved in propaganda as well. Its main rival and competitor was the Naval Intelligence Department, (), a department of the Imperial German Navy. With the Treaty of Versailles, the army was drastically reduced and military intelligence was disallowed. However, a troop office, called Department T 3 () also referred to the Army Statistical Department () was created to be the new military intelligence department, but essentially a continuation of the old department. Most of the information that came into the department came from open sources, specifically daily news and military news. For example, the officer responsible for intelligence gathering from Great Britain from sources like The Daily Telegraph, the United Services Review, the Journal of the Royal United Services Institution and the Journal of the Royal Engineers. In 1935, the department was renamed to Abteilung Fremde Heere or Department of Foreign Armies, and it was finally renamed in 10 November 1938 by Franz Halder who split it into two departments called Fremde Heere Ost and Fremde Heere West. The offices of both organizations were located at 76 Tirpitzufer in Berlin, which was and is colloquially known as Bendlerblock. Fremde Heere Ost was the third branch of the German General Staff, while Fremde Heere West was the twelfth. The FHO initial task was the collection of statistical and technical data on the armies that Germany was at war with or countries that it had planned to invade including Poland, Scandinavia, Balkans, the Soviet Union, China,and the United States. 1942 Gehlen predicted the downfall of the Nazi state, and the coming Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. He planned to preserve his office of the FHO and then present it to the US as a sort of gift.Critchfield, p 24-27 End of World War II As the war ended, Gehlen hid himself, his staff and his microfilmed files in the chaos of the downfall of Hitler's government. General William Wilson Quinn of the US Seventh Army, recognized Gehlen's name from a report by Allen Dulles of the OSS. He ensured Gehlen and his material were brought to the attention of the US government.Critchfield, p 29 Gehlen revealed his plan for Foreign Armies East to Captain John Boker of US Military Intelligence, who persuaded General Edwin Sibert of USFET to listen to Gehlen.Critchfield, p 30 The J-2 staff of the Pentagon was also involved. These operations eventually led to the formation of Operation X, Operation Rusty, 'the Organization', 'the Org', and finally, the 'Gehlen Organization'.Critchfield, p 32 The Gehlen Organization became a powerful spy ring during the early years of the Cold War. Eventually, this organization was transformed into the Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND, West Germany's intelligence service.Critchfield, p 21, 22, et al Many of the controversial aspects of Gehlen and his organization, such as its links to old Nazis, and its infiltration by Eastern bloc agents, were later described by Heinz H√∂hne & Hermann Zolling, in articles and a book, The General Was a Spy.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. The initial story in their Harold Shea series, it was first published in the May 1940 issue of the fantasy pulp magazine Unknown. It first appeared in book form, together with its sequel, \\"The Mathematics of Magic\\", in the collection The Incomplete Enchanter, issued in hardcover by Henry Holt and Company in 1941, and in paperback by Pyramid Books in 1960. It has since been reprinted in various collections by numerous other publishers, including The Compleat Enchanter (1975), The Incompleat Enchanter (1979), The Complete Compleat Enchanter (1989), and The Mathematics of Magic: The Enchanter Stories of L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt (2007). It has been translated into Dutch and Italian. In 2016, the story was shortlisted for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Novella. The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. In \\"The Roaring Trumpet\\", Shea visits his first such world, that of Norse mythology. Plot summary Psychologist Reed Chalmers speculates that the mental problems of his patients may stem from their minds not being fully in tune with the world they live in, but rather, partially in sync with other, parallel universes. He holds that if their minds were to be correctly aligned they could be cured, and, contrarily, that if completely realigned to another universe, they would be projected into that universe. Chalmers has devised a system of symbolic logic to encode the underlying assumptions of a universe into a mathematical formula, the use of which he believes could affect such a realignment. He is, however, hesitant to put his theory to a practical test. Chalmers's subordinate colleague Harold Shea has fewer qualms. Dissatisfied with his life, he attempts to use his boss's process to project himself into the world of Irish heroic mythology, where with his modern knowledge he thinks to set himself up as a wonder worker. However, interdimensional travel proves an inexact science, and he misses his target reality landing instead in the decidedly colder, bleaker world of Norse myth. Moreover, the adjustment is complete; now speaking Old Norse, Shea is unable to read the English language Boy Scout Handbook he has brought as a survival manual‚Äîworse, he finds his new world's superstitious, pre-scientific belief system encoded in its basic physics. His matches won't light, his stainless steel knife rusts, and magic actually works. Worst of all, the world is on the verge of Ragnar√∂k, the final conflict between the Gods and the Giants. Lost and freezing, Shea falls in with Odinn, who leads him to the mortal farmstead of Sverre, where the Gods are meeting. There he is befriended by the servant Thjalfi, through whose offices he comes under the dubious patronage of the malicious, mischief-making god Loki. More congenial is Loki's rival Heimdall, who fills Shea in on the situation. It seems that the gods face dim prospects in the coming battle, as two of their most potent magical weapons, Thor's hammer and Frey's sword, have been stolen by their enemies Shea is enlisted into a quest to recover the Gods' treasures, joining Thor, Loki and Thjalfi in expedition to the stronghold of the Frost Giant Utgardaloki. There the Gods engage in contests with their hosts: Thor incredibly loses a wrestling match with an ancient crone, while Loki is beaten in an eating competition. Shea, seeing through the Giants' illusions, discovers that Thor's opponent is the Midgard Serpent and Loki's is fire. Realizing that the weapon they seek may be present under similar disguise, he finds Thor's hammer bespelled beneath the appearance of a quiver of arrows. Thor calls it to him and a battle royal ensues, in which Shea and Heimdall, present incognito, are captured by Fire Giants and hustled off to prison. The two find prison life brutal and dull, passing the time by racing cockroaches until Shea comes up with a scheme to trick their troll jailer Sn√∂gg into releasing them. Pretending to be a warlock, he convinces Sn√∂gg he can shrink the troll's prodigious nose and so make him \\"handsome\\" enough (by troll standards) to win a wife. Shea thinks he and Heimdall can convince Sn√∂gg the spell has worked by pretending to see a reduction, but to his astonishment, the pretend spell actually works. The troll lives up to his end of the bargain, and during their escape Sn√∂gg recovers Frey's sword. Their quest is a success, but Ragnar√∂k is nearly at hand, and Heimdall cannot summon the gods to battle without authorization from Odinn. Continuing his experiments with magic, Shea whips up a couple of flying brooms to get them to him quickly. The ride is more interesting than it ought to be, since the broomsticks prove aerodynamically unstable. They catch up to Odinn in Hel, the coldest of the Nine Worlds, where the chief of the Gods, in disguise, is consulting a prophetess allied with the enemy. Heimdall reports their success. Realizing the Gods' identities, the furious hag attempts to banish them with her magic. They laugh off her efforts, and Odinn instructs Heimdall to blow his trumpet and muster the Gods. The hag turns her fury against Shea, and on him the banishment works. The din of the roaring trumpet still ringing in his ears, he suddenly finds himself back among his friends in his own world. Relation to Norse mythology The plotline of the story is based on the myths of Thor's expedition to Jotunhem as told in the Gylfaginning section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, and the V√∂lva's prophecy regarding Ragnarok in the poem V√∂lusp√°, preserved in the Poetic Edda.

Nucky is loosely based on former Atlantic City, New Jersey political figure Enoch Lewis \\"Nucky\\" Johnson. Nucky is employed as treasurer of Atlantic County, but in effect controls the region as a political boss. He is a corrupt and powerful politician who leads a double life as a gangster, and continuously struggles to meet his interests on both fronts. Charming and intelligent, he is adored by the people of Atlantic City, especially its poor and immigrant inhabitants, for his numerous acts of charity. However, in private he has a tight grip on the city's politics and vice. Throughout the series he is portrayed as a Machiavellian politician who makes his henchmen do the dirty work, while showing a more humane side to his friends and family. However, by the end of season 2 he is shown becoming more ruthless in order to compete in the violent bootlegging business. Buscemi won Best Actor in Dramatic Series at the 68th Golden Globe Awards for his performance as Nucky. In flashbacks throughout the fifth season, he is played by Nolan Lyons as a child and Marc Pickering as a young man. Fictional biography Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson was born around 1870 and raised in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the eldest child of a poor Irish Catholic family. His father Ethan was an abusive alcoholic who at one point scarred Nucky's hand with a fireplace poker, and his sister Susan died of tuberculosis. As a child, Nucky began working for local political boss \\"Commodore\\" Louis Kaestner (Dabney Coleman), who became his mentor in politics. For a time, Nucky attended New Jersey State Normal School in Trenton and planned on becoming a teacher. However, he left college and returned to Atlantic City, working his way up the ladder to become the deputy sheriff in the Commodore's machine under the close watch of Sheriff Jacob Lindsay (Boris McGiver). Nucky became sheriff after he arranged for the Commodore to rape Gillian Darmody (Gretchen Mol), who was only 13 years old at the time. Fifteen years prior to the series' timeline, Nucky lost his infant son, Enoch Jr., to pneumonia, a tragedy that drove his wife, Mabel, to commit suicide. Nucky helped raise Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt), the Commodore's son with Gillian, and pulled strings to get him into Princeton University. He is disappointed when Jimmy drops out to enlist in World War I, but still gives him a job as his personal driver after the war ends. When Jimmy finds out that Nucky enabled the Commodore to rape Gillian, it creates a rift between them. =Season one= In the pilot episode, set the day before Prohibition is to take effect, Nucky -- despite publicly supporting the ban of alcohol -- conspires with other local politicians to profit from a bootlegging scheme. He is assisted by his younger brother, Atlantic County Sheriff Eli Thompson (Shea Whigham). Nucky makes a deal with mobsters Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg), Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza) and Johnny Torrio (Greg Antonacci) to let them purchase his seaborne liquor shipments exclusively. However, Jimmy conspires with Torrio's driver, Al Capone (Stephen Graham), to rob Nucky's shipment to Rothstein after the mobster takes Nucky's casino for over $90,000. The heist ends in bloodshed as Jimmy and Capone kill Rothstein's men. Nucky gets Jimmy out of trouble, while privately reproaching him and banishing him from Atlantic City. He later recruits Jimmy back from Chicago when Rothstein seeks revenge for the robbery. The truck heist also leads to Nucky being put under investigation by Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon), an agent from the Bureau of Prohibition who suspects he knows more about the hijacking than he admits. Nucky meets Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald), a pregnant member of the Women's Temperance League who seeks work for her abusive husband, Hans (Joseph Sikora). Nucky is immediately taken with her and gives her some money. He has Hans killed after he beats her so badly that she miscarries the child, and gets her a job at a boutique after she gets out of the hospital. Nucky and Margaret soon become lovers, and by the end of the season he informally adopts her children, Teddy and Emily. This creates tension between him and his former mistress, Lucy Danziger (Paz de la Huerta). Margaret eventually learns the extent of Nucky's corruption, including his order to have Hans killed. She leaves him after they have a heated argument. When Margaret finds out that Nucky had lost a child, however, she meets with him to express her sympathy, and he tells her that the time he spent with her and her children was the happiest of his life. Moved by his sincerity -- and realizing that she and her children would likely starve without his support -- Margaret renews their relationship. Rothstein, seeking revenge for the robbery, employs the D'Alessio brothers to strike back at Nucky's enterprise. They first make their move by lynching a driver of Northside gangster Chalky White (Michael K. Williams), one of Nucky's partners. Sometime later, two of the brothers rob one of Nucky's bagmen in broad daylight on the Boardwalk. Later, they rob Nucky's illegal casino, shooting Eli when he tries to intervene. Nucky is forced to demote Eli while the heat blows over, and while he eventually reinstates his brother, their relationship is badly strained. A few days later, two of the D'Alessio brothers try to shoot Nucky as he is walking with Margaret on the pier, but Nucky's butler, Eddie Kessler, deflects the gun away at the last second, and an innocent woman is shot in the shoulder. Nucky gets a break when Mickey Doyle, who has been partnered with the D'Alessios, double crosses them and gives information to Nucky about the conspiracy. Nucky has Chalky to arrange a false deal with Meyer Lansky in the hopes of luring the D'Alessios out of hiding. Chalky captures Lansky and two of the D'Alessios when they meet with him, including one of the would-be shooters from the attempt on Nucky's life. Both D'Alessios are killed and Lansky is allowed to leave with a message for Rothstein. At the end of the season, Nucky and Rothstein come to a truce: all will be forgiven and Nucky will use his political connections to help Rothstein dodge a federal indictment for fixing the 1919 World Series in exchange for $1 million and for Rothstein giving up the remaining D'Alessio brothers, whom Nucky quickly has tracked down and killed. As Nucky rings in the new year of 1921 with Margaret at his side, Jimmy, Eli and the Commodore conspire to overthrow him and take over Atlantic City. =Season two= A few months later, Nucky is arrested for voter fraud concerning his behind-the-scenes role in the election of Mayor Edward L. Bader (Kevin O'Rourke), with corruption and murder charges soon to follow. Nucky suspects that the Commodore, Jimmy and Eli are plotting against him, a suspicion that is confirmed when his cronies defect to Jimmy's side. After the Commodore suffers a debilitating stroke, Eli panics and goes to Nucky for help, but Nucky gets into a violent argument with his brother and disowns him. Shortly afterward, one of Jimmy's men makes an attempt on Nucky's life. Following his father's death, Nucky resigns as treasurer and tells Jimmy and the Commodore that they have won. It is a ruse, however; soon afterward, he sets in motion a plan to drive Jimmy and his partners out of business. He bombs the warehouse containing Jimmy's alcohol, and persuades Chalky to instigate a strike among the city's black service workers, leaving the speakeasies and restaurants too understaffed to serve alcohol. Nucky then travels to Ireland to sell Thompson machine guns to the Irish Republican Army in exchange for Irish whiskey. Jimmy is left with no product or customers, while Nucky becomes the most powerful bootlegger in Atlantic City. By this time, the U.S. Attorney's Office has found damning evidence of Nucky's crimes. Nucky gives Margaret temporary guardianship of a valuable piece of real estate so that she and the children will be taken care of should he go to prison. Emily contracts polio, which Margaret believes is divine retribution for their sins; she considers cleansing her soul by testifying against Nucky, which would send him to the electric chair. Nucky tells her that he wants to marry her and become a better man, while admitting that marrying her would make her unable to take the stand against him. The next day, Margaret sees him teaching Emily to walk in her leg braces, and realizes that he loves her and her children. They get married that afternoon at Margaret's church. Jimmy meets with Nucky to apologize for his treason, offering to help. On Nucky's order, Jimmy and his accomplice Richard Harrow (Jack Huston) kill Alderman James Neary (Robert Clohessy), the prosecution's main witness. The U.S. Attorney's Office is forced to drop the charges. Nucky then visits Eli and makes him a deal: he will plead guilty to the voter fraud case and be sentenced to two years in prison, thus protecting Nucky from being charged again. That night, Nucky calls Jimmy and tells him that he has kidnapped Manny Horvitz (William Forsythe), the man who killed Jimmy's wife Angela (Aleksa Palladino). It is a trap, however: when Jimmy arrives, Nucky's men hold him at gunpoint, and Nucky shoots him twice in the head, killing him. The next day, Nucky lies to Margaret about reconciling with Jimmy, a lie she immediately sees through. To punish him, Margaret signs over the deed to his real estate -- which he had planned to use in a lucrative road construction deal -- to her church. =Season three= In 1923, Nucky faces trouble from Gyp Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), a New York gangster who works for Joe Masseria (Ivo Nandi). Due to political turmoil involving U.S. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty (Christopher McDonald), whom Nucky pays $40,000 a month to protect him from any criminal investigations, Nucky agrees to simplify his operation and sell exclusively to Rothstein. Infuriated, Rosetti takes over Tabor Heights, a small town on the road between Atlantic City and New York where convoys stop for gas. He then blockades any of Nucky's alcohol deliveries from going through. The feud escalates when Rosetti kills eleven of Nucky's men. Rothstein sends Benjamin Siegel (Michael Zegen) to kill Rosetti, but the hit is unsuccessful. However, it does force Rosetti to flee Tabor Heights and go back to New York. Back home, Nucky's marriage to Margaret is now no more than a public show, and Nucky spends much of his time in Manhattan with his mistress Billie Kent (Meg Chambers Steedle). When Eli is released from prison, Nucky gives him a job in a liquor warehouse, but wants nothing to do with him personally. This changes when Eli is able to anticipate Rosetti's ambush, even though he is unable to stop it. After an Easter dinner with the family, Nucky reconciles with Eli and they go back to working together. In Washington, D. C., Daugherty plans to indict Nucky for bootlegging to make him a scapegoat for the corruption charges facing the Harding Administration. Nucky goes to Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon (James Cromwell) and convinces him to have George Remus (Glenn Fleshler) arrested in exchange for Nucky illegally running Mellon's distillery in West Overton, Pennsylvania. Remus has direct ties to Daugherty's accomplice Jess Smith (Ed Jewett), causing further problems for Daugherty and leaving Nucky in the clear. Rosetti convinces Masseria to provide him with extra men to take over Atlantic City. Acting on a tip from Gillian, Rosetti bombs Nucky's favorite restaurant in order to kill him, Rothstein and Luciano. All three survive the explosion, but Billie is killed. Nucky organizes a meeting with the East Coast crime bosses to seek support for killing both Rosetti and Masseria. Everyone at the meeting declines, however, and the job is left to Nucky's right-hand man Owen Sleater (Charlie Cox). However, Luciano and Lansky alert Masseria to Nucky's attempted hit in exchange for Masseria financing their heroin operation. As Owen enters a Turkish bathhouse to kill Masseria, he is fatally ambushed and shipped back to Nucky in a crate. From Margaret's grief-stricken reaction to Owen's death, Nucky deduces that the two had been having an affair. Nucky narrowly escapes being killed by Masseria's men and recruits White and Capone to provide men to fight back against Rosetti. An all-out gang war ensues with men being killed on both sides. Rothstein tries to convince Masseria to end his support for Rosetti in exchange for Nucky giving up 99% of the profits from Mellon's distillery. The agreement is a trap, however; as part of his deal with Nucky, Mellon has Rothstein arrested. White and Capone send their men to ambush Masseria's gang as they leave Atlantic City, resulting in a bloodbath. Meanwhile, Harrow unexpectedly storms the Artemis Club, massacring many of Rosetti's men and managing to rescue Tommy Darmody, who is held at gunpoint. Rosetti and two of his men are able to escape, but his second in command, Tonino Sandrelli (Chris Caldovino), kills Rosetti so Nucky will spare him. Nucky tries to reconcile with Margaret, who has left him and taken the children. Margaret rebuffs him, however, and refuses to accept money from him. =Season four= In 1924, Nucky has made peace with Masseria and Rothstein, and is a silent partner in Chalky's nightclub on the Boardwalk. He travels to Tampa, Florida to look into investing in a distillery run by Bill McCoy (Pearce Bunting), but rejects the deal, believing the location is too high- profile. He changes his mind and becomes part owner, unaware that McCoy has killed one of his investors. He also takes on Luciano and Lansky as partners in the distillery. While in Florida, he begins an affair with speakeasy owner Sally Wheet (Patricia Arquette). Nucky's empire faces a new threat in BOI Agent James Tolliver (Brian Geraghty), who infiltrates his distribution network by posing as a corrupt Prohibition agent. When Nucky sends Eddie to Penn Station to deliver money to Ralph Capone (Domenick Lombardozzi), Tolliver detains and blackmails him into revealing Nucky's arrangement with the Capones. Eddie returns to Nucky's house and commits suicide. Days later, Nucky has an uneasy reunion with Margaret and tells her of Eddie's death. Meanwhile, Nucky gets Eli's son Willie (Ben Rosenfield) off a murder charge by framing his college roommate and bribing the Philadelphia district attorney. Nucky gets Willie a job in the mayor's office. Tolliver finds out the truth, however, and tells Eli he will put Willie in prison unless he informs on Nucky. Eli becomes Tolliver's spy, and arranges for Nucky to attend a meeting with Masseria in which both will be arrested. Chalky asks for Nucky's backing in a war with heroin kingpin Valentin Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright). Nucky refuses to get involved, but Chalky becomes more insistent after Narcisse tries to kill him and brutalizes his mistress, Daughter Maitland (Margot Bingham). Nucky learns that Lansky is smuggling Narcisse's heroin on Masseria's orders and meets with Masseria and Narcisse in order to get his cut of the profits. Nucky orders Bader to have two sheriff's deputies drive Chalky to Philadelphia, but Bader is now supporting Narcisse and orders the deputies to kill Chalky. They fail, however, and Chalky shows up at Nucky's door demanding answers. To make amends, Nucky orders Harrow to kill Narcisse, and in return pulls strings to have Gillian convicted of murder so Harrow can take custody of Tommy. The hit goes awry, and Harrow and Chalky's daughter are killed. Nucky begins to suspect that Eli is informing on him, and cancels the meeting with Masseria. He arranges to go with Sally to Cuba, but first confronts Eli. Nucky pulls a gun on his brother, but after Willie walks in and Eli reveals Tolliver's blackmail, Nucky cannot bring himself to pull the trigger.http://tvline.com/2013/11/24/boardwalk-empire-season-5-spoilers-cast- returning/ When Eli kills Tolliver, Nucky sends him to Chicago under Capone's protection and goes to Cuba with Sally. =Season five= In 1931, Nucky travels between Cuba, New York and New Jersey, planning to go into the legal liquor business in anticipation of the end of Prohibition. In Cuba, an attempt is made on his life, and he suspects that Luciano and Lansky are behind it. In New York, he tries to start a partnership with Mayflower Grain Inc. executive Joseph Kennedy (Matt Letscher), but Kennedy turns him down. Nucky goes back to Atlantic City, where he befriends a bellboy named Joe Harper (Travis Tope), who reminds him of himself as a young man. Meanwhile, Margaret visits him for the first time in years to ask for his help in dealing with Rothstein's widow, who is blackmailing her. He gives her money in return for her help in driving down the price of Mayflower's stock. Soon afterward, Sally is murdered by Havana police and he is drawn into a feud between Luciano and Capone. When Luciano and Lansky make another attempt on his life - with his old friend Torrio's backing - Nucky declares war on them. He has Siegel kidnapped to force a meeting with Luciano and Lansky, who kidnap Willie in retaliation. At the meeting, Luciano threatens to kill Willie. Desperate to save his nephew, Nucky gives Luciano control of his empire in Atlantic City, and arranges to have Luciano's boss Salvatore Maranzano (Giampiero Judica) killed. That night, he receives a letter from Gillian, who is now in a sanitorium, begging him for help. In the series finale, Nucky short-sells Mayflower's stock with Margaret's help, and he makes a huge profit. He plans to leave Atlantic City forever, and says his goodbyes to Margaret and Eli. He visits Gillian in the sanitorium, and says the most he can do is set up a trust for her when she is released. On Nucky's last night in Atlantic City, he gets a call from the police, who have arrested Harper; Nucky bails him out and offers to give him money, but Harper angrily rejects the gesture. Hours later, Harper confronts Nucky and reveals who he truly is: Tommy Darmody, Jimmy Darmody's son and Gillian's grandson. Tommy accuses Nucky of betraying Gillian and guns him down. Nucky dies as IRS agents, who had followed him the entire evening, identify themselves and arrest Tommy. The arrival of the agents is a reference to the eventual fate of the real Enoch Johnson, who was imprisoned in 1941 on tax evasion charges. Casting In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss Enoch L. Johnson), Winter wanted to stray from the real life of Johnson as much as possible. \\"If we were going to cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast Jim Gandolfini.\\" The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on The Sopranos. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. \\"I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you. Explained Scorsese, \\"I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor.\\" Reception Buscemi has won and been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Nucky Thompson. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Award at the 63rd and 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. In addition, Buscemi won Best Actor in Dramatic Series at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, while also getting nominated at the 69th and 70th Awards. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the 17th and 18th Screen Actors Guild Awards while being nominated at the 19th, 20th and 21st. Buscemi won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series two years in a row from 2011 to 2012, while also being nominated in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

The game features a customizable cartoon avatar, called a \\"Fantagian\\", that users can customize with items ranging from hair to clothing and accessories. Fantage released to the general public on March 17, 2008 and had since expanded into a large online community‚Äî the game had over 16 million registered users by January 2012 and over 30 million by December 2014. The game was designed for the ages of 6 to 16. According to its founders, Fantage was focused on child safety, made possible by a three-tiered safety system. This safety system had several features, such as professional chat moderation, automatic word filtering, an in-game user reporting system, and varying chat options for parents. On May 17, 2018, Fantage announced that the game would shut down on June 30, 2018. At 12:36 AM EDT on July 1, 2018, Fantage closed down its servers to all users.  History  According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Fantage began development after the founders of the game, David Hwang and Peter Bae, created their company in January 2007, and the game was initially an educational math website until they received negative reception from a focus group of kids. A closed beta version of the game was available on October 29, 2007, which granted beta testers full access to features normally available through a paid membership, and the game went open beta on January 1, 2008. The game eventually released on March 17, 2008, where beta testers were gifted with a month of free membership, 1,000 Stars, and exclusive Beta Tester hair items, while new members received 2 weeks of free membership. In 2009‚Äì2010, Fantage received strategic investments from Nexon. These investments allowed Fantage to hire additional designers and key developers. The resulting site expansion and quality enhancement led to swift growth. In less than four months, from November 2009 to February 2010, Fantage completed the entire site renewal, which involved upgrades of more than thirty mini-games. Within a year, the user base grew from 3 million to 7.7 million registered users. Fantage developed and employed its own real time mass data processing technology, which enables 20 million users to access the site without any inconvenience. This database and server side program was created by Byungsoo Son, Frank Kim, Sungwon Um, and Dongpyo Lee, who were all key developers for the game. Fantage Inc. is currently headquartered in Fort Lee, New Jersey and run by Nexon.The message Fantage's development team left for the game's users regarding the game's discontinuation. = Overseas = On December 14, 2009, it was reported on a Japanese online gaming news site, Game Watch, that Nexon was releasing Fantage in Japan in February 2010. The game was eventually released on February 10, 2010 as , which was nicknamed \\"Fantage Japan\\" by players outside of Japan. As Nexon of Japan owned this version of the game, a Nexon Japan ID was required to create an account and to log in, and Nexon Points were used as another currency for the game. Some features from the game made for this version eventually were released internationally, such as two eye sets and some clothing items (though they were altered somewhat for unknown reasons). Notable features exclusive to this version of the game were Rare items being accessible from shops (they are normally available by gem combinations in the original game), the absence of a paid membership, and Magic Boxes, which contained special items. Oshare Land Fantage shut down on December 15, 2010. Nixon of Europe released a version of Fantage for European users in 2010, and similar to Oshare Land Fantage, the game required a Nexon Europe ID to create an account. The game shut down on July 20, 2011. Fantage has also been released onto France and Germany. = Mobile development = Since 2011, Fantage Inc. has created several mobile applications, such as Fantage IDfone, Fantage Bullseye, Fantage Fish Fish, and Starblaze. Their apps were available on App Store and Google Play, with a few exceptions not being available on Google Play. In 2014, Fantage released an iPad app called Fantage Comet, which was similar to the original game, but took place on a different area. Like some of the other apps, Fantage Comet was compatible with the original game, where users were able to log in and buy exclusive items from the app that could also be used into the online game. In recent times, many of the apps received negative reception from players. The company's Google Play page was shut down upon announcement of the game's closure. = Discontinuation = On May 17, 2018, Fantage announced that the game would be permanently closed on June 30, 2018. The game stopped receiving membership payments as of May 17, 2018, and the game's payment page and related mobile apps have been closed down. In commemoration of the game's discontinuation, the game hosted its last event, called \\"Farewell Party\\", which ran through May 17 through May 23, 2018. Users were given free items on each day of the event they have logged into the game, and Premium Membership was given to all users from June 1 through June 30, 2018. Fantage finally closed its doors on July 1, 2018 at 12:36 AM.  Business model  Fantage started out as a self-funded organization, but the company later received an infusion of capital from Nexon. Initial admission into Fantage was free and users can continue to use it as such; however, premium membership is required to access the full site including most clothing items, rare items, most gems, customization options, and most pets. Users also can purchase eCoins or Gold, which are additional currencies alongside Stars, in bulk amounts for set fees to use in-game for micro transactions. eCoins and Gold can be used to purchase almost every item, but only eCoins can be used to buy pet codes to speed up pet hatching, while only Gold can be used to purchase Limited items and items from other players in MyMall, an area in the game that provides users with premium membership the ability to sell items.  Environment  Screenshot of in-game environment Once users created an account, they were given a basic tutorial and eventually a few items and a basic house. To move around in the world, players would click on where they wanted their avatar to go. Players had the option of opening their home to everyone, just their buddies, or no one other than the owner themselves. Players were also given ID Cards (later changed to IDfones, which were initially called \\"myFones\\" in 2009), which were accessible by clicking on the user's avatar and provided information about said user, such as the amount of in-game money the user had or the player's overall level, which was made up by the Medals the player earned for their user. Many of these Medals would be invisible to others unless the user had a premium membership. Fantage took place on the titular floating island, which consisted of 13 main areas for users to explore: Downtown, Uptown, Mt. Fantage, Castle, Carnival, Beach, Forest, Fantage School, Pet Town, User Home, Sea Breeze, Lighthouse, and the Island; inside most of these main areas had additional smaller areas, such as shops and areas containing mini-games. There were several shops where players could purchase items with any of Fantage's 3 currencies; Stars, eCoins and Gold. Stars could be earned by playing games; eCoins by buying with real money, watching advertisements, or daily check-in; and Gold by buying, or through a transfer system in MyMall. = Games = Fantage had a selection of mini-games, some of which were multiplayer games. Some of the website's notable games were Top Models Fashion Show (a fashion show game), Splash! (a water balloon game), and Rocket Board (a roller coaster game). Users would earn a quantity of Stars depending on the player's score. After 2014's \\"Fantage Cataclysm\\" event, an event for the game's 6th anniversary that also included additions to the game's lore and a new redesign for the game's map, most of the mini-games in Fantage were compiled and moved to the Retro Arcade, located at the Carnival area. There was also the Creature Area, which had contained the Creature Arena and Creature Shop. Users could enter as a Creature purchasable from the Creature Shop and play with a variety of trampolines, cannons, and other things while collecting Stars. After the \\"Fantage Cataclysm\\", the Creature Area was removed, with the Creature Arena and Creature Shop being moved to the Forest. = Pets = In 2010, Fantage introduced Pets and the Pet Town to players. Users could collect pets by purchasing and hatching eggs or by using pet codes. Premium Members could hatch all pets using eggs; non-Premium members could only hatch two pets using eggs. Users who obtained eCoins were able to purchase Magic Codes to hatch a specific pet they wanted and at a faster rate. There were three magic code hatching times available 1 hour, 20 minute, or Instant. Occasionally, Fantage would release certain holiday-themed eggs that premium members can buy for a certain number of stars to get limited holiday pets. An additional family, Codies, were only available by collecting and assembling multiple items from Captain Cody, Fantage's resident superhero. Premium members also had the option to have their pets trail behind them as they explored Fantage and to let pets wander on the first floor of their home. All users could use their pets for Pet Games, which were located in the Pet Town area that specifically features pets. For players without pets (or enough pets, in the case of one game, Wild Rumble), Pet Games would lend them a pet to play with. The Top Models Fashion Show game was eventually updated to allow all users to use their pets to earn more points. = Farming = In 2013, Fantage introduced Farms to all players. Farms were accessible from the player's house or through their IDfone. Players were given 3 plots of land to plant seeds of various plants, which could be bought with Stars and planted with Sun Energy. After a specified period of time, the resulting crops could be harvested with Sun Energy to earn Stars. Farming also gave points to a certain Farming medal for the user's overall level. Much like FarmVille, players had to wait real time for plants to grow and could have helped out farms belonging to other players. Players could help out an unlimited number of people a day, but each farm could only be helped out 3 times per day. = Mission Center = Fantage had a Mission Center where players could participate in Missions. There were various Missions for users to play from and each Mission could be replayed once they were finished at least once. Upon completion (or re-completion) of a Mission, players were rewarded with points on their Mission Medal, which, like all Medals, counts toward the overall level of the user. Many of these missions had segments with mini-games and puzzles, which must be completed in order to progress further into the mission. These missions were often related to the creation of certain areas, such as the Lighthouse being created for the Mad Scientist mission, and some have provided some characterization to Fantage's NPCs. = Parties and socialization = Users may add up to 200 friends, or \\"buddies\\", and chat through instant messenger one-to-one or through a group chat. Users could also click on a player's avatar and click the ignore button, so that the ignored user's chat won't be seen to the player. Users could delete a buddy any time. If any user is bullying or using inappropriate behavior, players may click on the report button and the reported user is immediately ignored. Fantage's chat system allowed players to have one of three chat modes set on their avatar. The first mode, \\"Fantage Chat\\", was the normal mode where users can chat freely, though some messages will be filtered and will not be visible to others if they contain private information. The second mode, \\"Safe Chat\\", has the normal chat bubble disabled in favor of limited chat phrases, and was the mode recommended to parents concerned for their children during the game's run. The third mode, \\"No Chat\\", completely disables the user from chatting or seeing others chat in the game. Parties were later introduced in 2010 and could be used to invite large numbers of people to the player's house. Players may choose the theme of the party and whether the party was for everyone in the server or their friends (with later features allowing different music tracks to be played). Only one party could only be hosted at a time, even if the player leaves one server and tries to create another party in another server. Hosting a party costs 50 Stars, but players could buy additional features to the party, such as pi√±atas and exclusive party-themed stickers. Parties were previously limited to premium members, but in 2014, all users were able to host their own parties. = Education and charity = The Fantage School was introduced in 2011 as a new area with a variety of educational mini-games, ranging from math and chess to language arts and geography. The first floor contained art, math, social studies, and language arts, while the second floor had chess, checkers, and a trivia game. The bottom floor also contained an area where players could create their own Private Classrooms, where groups of players can enter and try to beat each other's scores on the mini-games provided in this area. Fantage has collaborated with a school in Los Angeles in 2012, where a fifth-grade class would participate in the \\"Fantage School Challenge.\\" The challenge consists of the fifth-grade class being separated into two teams, where they would play Fantage's educational games to see which team had the better scores. Fantage has also held events in the past where users can donate their Stars to charity. Some charity sites the game has been noted to work with include Child's Play in 2011 and Delivering Good (which was known then as K.I.D.S.) in 2013. Reception Within its first few years of launch, Fantage has gained positive reviews, with most of the praise going towards the game's kid-friendly environment. On March 9, 2010, Fantage received the Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review for excellence in children's interactive media, with the website's review on the game saying: \\"Fantage, or 'fantastic age' is a responsive, safe and no-fail MMO that resembles Club Penguin back in the good old days.\\" Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat notes that Fantage offers \\"fun games and social activities in a safe, parent-friendly setting\\", and how the game developed much more than 200 kid-friendly virtual world games that were then reported of being under development. A user on GamersInfo.net by the name of \\"Alladania\\" states that the game \\"has the potential to be more socially involving than games for the younger set but has enough other things going on that a lot of social chit- chat isn‚Äôt a requirement to have fun.\\" Jo McClelland of TIME has acknowledged the site as one of the best social networks for preteens. Carolina Ribeiro of Portuguese online magazine TechTudo believes the game can be enjoyed by kids while protecting their real identity and appearance with the game's avatars. Legacy A day after Fantage announced their discontinuation, rumors of an attempt to recreate Fantage's environment by creating a private server with the game's files surfaced. This project was then confirmed under the name Fantage Legacy. The project, which promised fan-requested ideas such as all users being given Premium Membership and the absence of in-game currencies other than Stars, gained many support from fans of the original game. The Pixel Park logo. A rainbow effect was previously used during the 2019 Pride Month. On July 12, 2018, the Fantage Legacy team announced on the project's official blog that the project was being discontinued, due to an e-mail from the official Fantage team that warned them of possible legal action that would accuse the team of Fantage copyright infringement. Despite this, it was also announced that same day that they would be working on a game similar to Fantage (codenamed Plan Z), as the Fantage Legacy team continued posting updates through their blog until May 28, 2019, when they revealed Pixel Park, the successor to Fantage Legacy. The Fantage Legacy website closed on May 31, and Pixel Park eventually launched its public beta on November 28. The first few hours of launch saw 156 users playing the game. The game had features such as clothing, chat, Player Cards, events, and other features. On January 10, 2020, Pixel Park closed its public beta, and registration for the game closed. Existing users (more than 1,500) were still able to play the game. On April 12, 2020, it was announced that development for Pixel Park would be suspended due to lack of finances and support. The game shut down on April 30. As of May 5, 2020, the website is no longer online.

For many years, wearing glasses while playing the sport was an embarrassment. Baseball talent scouts routinely rejected spectacled prospects on sight. The stigma had diminished by the early 1960s and by one estimate 20 percent of major league players wore glasses by the end of the 1970s. The development of shatter-resistant lenses in the latter half of the 1940s contributed to their acceptance. The first major-league player to wear spectacles was Will 'Whoop-La' White in 1878‚Äì86. Only pitchers dared wear glasses while playing until the early 1920s, when George 'Specs' Toporcer of the St. Louis Cardinals became the first outfielder to sport eyewear. Bespectacled pitchers are less rare as they have less need to field the ball. There are only two players in the Baseball Hall of Fame to have worn eyeglasses during play: Chick Hafey and Reggie Jackson. Because his vision became so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of glasses. Young uprising star Mike Stringer of the Arkansas Peacocks had his career ended by a flying splinter from a broken bat, blinding him in one eye. This lead him to be the first athlete to promote the use of Rec Specs in professional baseball. He earned the nickname after the accident of Mike ‚Äúwhich way is he actually looking‚Äù Stringer.

It was the last major battle of the war. The Chinese force consisted of a garrison of Manchu and Mongol Bannermen.Elliott, Mark (June 1990). \\"Bannerman and Townsman: Ethnic Tension in Nineteenth-Century Jiangnan\\". Late Imperial China 11 (1): 36‚Äì74. In command of the British forces was Sir Hugh Gough. Leading one brigade was future British field marshal Sir Colin Campbell.Greenwood 2015, p. 496 The British capture of this stronghold allowed them to proceed to Nanking. Fought near the confluence of the Grand Canal and Yangtze River, the battle effectively blocked operation of the Caoyun system, a transport network vital for the movement of grain throughout the empire. As a result, the Daoguang Emperor decided to sue for peace and agreed to sign the Treaty of Nanking, which brought hostilities to an end. Mass suicide was committed by the Manchu Bannermen who were defending the city.  Battle  In mid July, the British ships concentrated on Chinkiang and blocked the route between the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal. On the morning of July 21, the British attacked Chinkiang City in three directions with four brigades. With the support of artillery brigade, 2,310 soldiers of the first brigade attacked the Qing army guarding the outside of Chinkiang City; 1,832 soldiers of the second brigade attacked the west gate with the support of navy; 2,155 soldiers of the third brigade attacked the north gate. At this time, there were 1,583 Bannermen in Chinkiang and 2,700 Green Standard Army in the southwest suburb. The Green Standard Army were transferred from other provinces after the fort outside the city was attacked and the situation in Chinkiang was tense. The Green Standard Army, who were temporarily concentrated, were not familiar with the terrain of Chinkiang. Their weapons are all swords and spears, except for a small number of muskets. At 7 a.m. the British third brigade landed in Beigu mountain, and then attacked the north gate, which was covered by the British ship's heavy artillery. The Bannermen guarding the north gate immediately shot with muskets, hitting and injuring two British captains. The Bannermen dismantled some battlements and temporarily set up artillery to counterattack the British army. More than an hour after the fierce battle, the artillery of the Bannermen was destroyed, and the British troops rushed to the battery from the side. The garrison fought with the British on the wall of the city. Before dawn, the first brigade successfully landed and occupied the highlands near Jinshan. At 8 a.m., the British began their attack on the Green Standard Army stationed outside the city. These Green Standard Army came to reinforce the city from afar. Because of their tired journey and lack of food, they were defeated by the British army after fierce battle. Many Green Standard Army soldiers became deserters. The commander of Green Standard Army saw the fire in Chinkiang City and thought that the city had been lost, so he ordered the remaining soldiers to retreat. The west gate is the main battlefield for the British to attack the city. Shortly after the battle between the north gate and the southwest suburb, the second brigade began to attack the west gate. The British soldiers of the two regiments occupied some houses outside the city to shoot at the garrison under the cover; meanwhile, the transport ship carrying the British marines drove along the canal to the west gate, where they planned to attack the city. The west gate garrison fired at the British Army on land and the Marine Corps in the canal, injuring 16 sailors, 8 gunners and an officer and forcing the British army to withdraw from the canal within 10 minutes. After that, the British army sent another 200 Marines to cooperate with the land force to attack Chinkiang city again, this time they successfully occupied part of the city buildings. The defenders fought fiercely with the British Army on the city buildings. At noon, the British army sent a team of engineers to blow up the west gate with gunpowder. At the same time, the third brigade of the British Army occupying the north gate rushed to the west gate to fight, and finally the Qing's defense was broken. However, the garrison and the British army had a fierce street battle in the city. At least 40 British officers and soldiers were injured or killed in the street war. After the British army completely seized the city, Hai Ling, the supreme commander of the Qing army, and his family committed suicide.

Plot In the first scene, set around a major hunt, Miss May one of the servants at the park, is seduced by Frank the footman. Subsequently, they marry. Frank becomes a taxi driver, and his gradual rise in the world mirrors the decline of the estate. That same night the three boys go clambering over the roof of Neapcaster Park.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History  The Forrest Block was constructed in 1875 by John Forrest as a commercial block. Forrest was a capitalist who invested his financial resources in several buildings downtown. This is the location of the homestead where he lived for 33 years before he redeveloped it. It is one of a number of large commercial buildings in Davenport that were designed in an elaborate Italianate style during the decade after the American Civil War. with Prominent Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen designed the building and J.H. Whittaker was the general contractor. The building is designed to have retail businesses on the main floor and professional offices on the upper floors. Forrest Block from the southwest Over the course of its history, the building has housed small retail businesses, doctor's offices, a billiards parlor, a tavern, and an adult movie theater. The second floor was the location of the city's YMCA organization in 1886. The Ancient Order of United Workmen (AOUW) was located on the third floor. The post office occupied the corner storefront from 1889 to 1996. Other organizations that have been housed in the building include the Davenport Health Institute, the Tri-City Institute of Osteopathy, the Davenport Cooking School, and the Woodmen Hall. Dr. Jennie McCowen, a physician and a locally prominent leader for women‚Äôs rights, had her office in the building for many years. The second and third floors housed apartments in its more recent history. The building was called the Henley block for a while starting in 1910. The Forrest Block had not been occupied since the 1980s and was nearly torn down in 1991 to make way for a parking lot, but the city council blocked demolition because of protests by historic preservationists. Although it deteriorated over the years, the building remained structurally sound because when it was constructed it was \\"over-built\\" with extra floor bracing and other heavy-duty construction elements. The building's owners in 1999 received a state grant to install a new roof that helped stabilize the building as well. Highland Brothers bought the building for $130,000 in 2005. The following year they announced plans to convert the building into 10 luxury condominiums and commercial space on the first-floor. Work began on the renovation project, but soon ended. In 2009 the building was bought by Restoration St. Louis, who also owned the Hotel Blackhawk, which they were in the process of renovating at the time. They started renovating the Forrest Block building in March 2010. The $3.5 million renovation turned the building into 24 market rate apartments. Four of the units are live-and-work spaces. The building, which is , was divided into one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Some of the apartments face an interior courtyard. The project was completed in January 2011. A rooftop garden was also added to the building. Architecture The Forrest Block is a three-story, brick structure built on a stone foundation. It features a seven-bay symmetrical front and 17 bays on the upper floor of the southern elevation. Its location on a corner lot contributes to its imposing character. On the exterior of the building, each floor is distinct from the others. The windows on the main floor are nearly flat and become more rounded as they ascend. Each window has its own elaborate hood. The building is crowned with an imposing, bracketed cornice of pressed metal. On the Brady Street elevation the building features a pavilion which projects from the fa√ßade. It contains oversized Roman arched windows and a segmented cornice.

Beginning in the late 1970s, he became active within the civil rights movement, which he had once opposed. He has spoken and written extensively on civil rights and social justice. Background Tom Turnipseed was born on August 27, 1936 to parents George Franklin Turnipseed and Ruby May Turnipseed, n√©e Bell. A native of Mobile, Alabama, Turnipseed received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he met his wife, Judith (\\"Judy\\"), while she was a graduate student at the institution. The couple wed in 1963 and had two children. Turnipseed died from respiratory failure in 2020. Career and political campaigns In 1966, Turnipseed became the first executive director of the South Carolina Independent School Association, an accrediting agency set up to legitimize segregation academies. Turnipseed was the executive director of the George Wallace presidential campaign, 1968, when the former governor of Alabama received 13 percent of the vote against Hubert Humphrey and Richard M. Nixon. Turnipseed entered a 12-step recovery program after he was fired by Wallace for drinking. After the American Independent Party campaign, Turnipseed, like Wallace, returned to the Democratic Party. Turnipseed soon embraced the party's liberal majority wing and joined the interest group, Americans for Democratic Action, founded in 1947 by, among others, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Reuther, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Turnipseed was elected to the South Carolina Senate, serving from 1976 to 1980. That year he was the Democratic nominee for South Carolina's 2nd congressional district. He was defeated by the incumbent Republican Floyd D. Spence, a former Democrat and lawyer from Columbia who benefited from the Ronald W. Reagan presidential campaign that year. In the Spence-Turnipseed race, Republican strategist Lee Atwater planted questions with reporters about Turnipseed's treatment as a teenager for depression, and repeatedly stated that he was \\"hooked up to jumper cables\\". Turnipseed had discussed his electroshock treatments in media interviews prior to the race, but the issue soon received much wider publicity due to Atwater's efforts and ultimately doomed his re-election bid.Ben Johnson, \\"Forced abortions and other South Carolina dirty tricks\\", The Daily Beast, 21 January 2012, accessed 9 May 2015 A decade later, as Atwater was battling a late stage cancer that eventually claimed his life, he wrote to Turnipseed to ask for forgiveness for his actions; Turnipseed accepted his apology and later attended his funeral.What Lee Atwater learned and the lesson for his prot√©g√©s. Washington Post 16 April 1991, Page A19 In 1982, Turnipseed lost a Democratic runoff election for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina to Michael R. Daniel. Frye Gaillard of the Charlotte Observer described him as \\"angry and shrill, and even some of the people who agreed with him finally wished he'd go away. He tried to change his style for [this] campaign, but it was apparently too late. That's a shame, however, because politics can do with a little more passion. And particularly so when that sense of being right comes, as Turnipseed's did, from a deeply felt knowledge of what it means to be wrong.\\" In 1998, Turnipseed ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for Attorney General of South Carolina. Though he won twenty-six counties and finished with more than 46 percent of the vote, Turnipseed was defeated by the incumbent Republican Charlie Condon. However, the Republican governor, David Beasley, was unseated that year, and the GOP failed in its last attempt to unseat U.S. Senator Fritz Hollings. Activism Turnipseed was the president of the South Carolina Trial Lawyers Association. He was the former board chairman of the interest group, the Center for Democratic Renewal, formerly known as the National Anti-Klan Network, based in Atlanta. Turnipseed was the co-counsel for the Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, South Carolina. The church accused the Ku Klux Klan in the 1997 burning of its sanctuary and filed a civil suit against them for damages. In 1998, the African-American congregation won a $37 million jury verdict against the Klan. In 1998, Turnipseed received the Unitarian Universalist Association's highest honor, the Holmes Weatherly Award for the pursuit of social justice. Of Anglo descent, Turnipseed was a board member of the South Carolina Hispanic Leadership Council, a statewide, non-profit organization founded to inform, advocate for, and educate, both the Hispanic community and the population at large, on issues affecting Hispanics. Turnipseed had also been active in the environmental movement in South Carolina. He was the founding chairman of the Citizens' Local Environmental Action Network (CLEAN), a statewide umbrella and informational clearing house for local citizens' groups concerned with toxic waste dumps in their areas. Turnipseed argues that \\"environmental racism and classism\\" lead to toxic waste sites being located disproportionately in minority and poorer communities. He has argued that toxic wastes constantly migrate through the air, water, and soil and eventually threaten all persons. Media host and author Turnipseed has hosted radio shows on WCAY, WCTG, WCEO, and WOIC. He has also hosted a television show on WIS TV. In both formats, his programs provide a forum for discussing diverse issues. He has hosted community leaders, national and local leaders in politics and public affairs, sports, and arts, and entertainment. The Seed Show broad/web casts live on WOIC, 1230AM (Air America) and seedshow.com every weekday from 8 to 9 a.m. He continues to speak and write about political and human rights, traveling throughout the country. His articles and opinion pieces have been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Minneapolis Star- Tribune, The Charlotte Observer, CounterPunch, The State, and other newspapers. Turnipseed's essays have been featured in several books, including Cast A Cold Eye and America's Opinion Writers. His essay, \\"Renewing The Spirit Of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: King Day at the Dome 2003\\", is featured in the third edition of Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students, a college textbook by Sharon Crawley and Debra Hawhee, published in 2004 by Pearson/Longman.

If the eggs are touched by the player's laser base then a life is lost, so they effectively confine the movement of the laser base until they disappear after some pre-set time. There are a total of eight levels (called \\"phases\\" in the cassette inlay instructions), each successively more difficult than the last. The most difficult level has a total of two Birdmen and eight missiles raining down on the player simultaneously.

Koninsky (August 1879 ‚Äì January 2, 1952) was an American composer, music publisher, and music teacher who lived most of her life in Troy, New York. A prolific composer, she is thought to have authored over 300 pieces of music, including waltzes and marches. \\"Eli Green's Cakewalk\\", which became a popular hit when it appeared in 1898, was also the first cakewalk published by a woman. Some of her work was published under her male pseudonym, Jerome Hartman. Biography Sadie was the youngest of the five children born to Harris and Mary Koninsky of Troy, New York. Both parents were of European extraction. As a child, she received classical training in violin. Her first published compositions, \\"The Belles of Andalusia\\" (a waltz) and \\"The Minstrel King\\" (a march) appeared in 1894 and 1895, respectively. In 1896, she sold \\"Eli Green's Cake Walk\\" to Joseph W. Stern, a music publisher in New York City, who published it (under her legal name) with lyrics added by a staff writer. After studying piano with Harriet Brower, she took a job at Stern's company as an arranger. Soon afterward, Sadie and her brother Maurice went into the music business. By 1899, the family business, then known as \\"Edw. M. Koninsky & Brothers\\", was publishing music, including Sadie's sequel titled \\"Phoebe Thompson's Cake Walk\\". She became the main arranger and composer at Koninsky Music. During this time, her marches appeared under the name of \\"Jerome Hartman\\". During the 1920s, Sadie launched a publishing house of her own (Goodwyn Music Publishers) and also taught music and violin. She was still teaching in 1947. She died on January 2, 1952 and was buried at B'rith Sholom Cemetery in Troy. There is no evidence that she ever married.

Youth =Flight from West Prussia= Oertel was born in Stuhm, West Prussia, Germany (today Sztum, Poland). In January 1945, Oertel escaped from the advancing Red Army with his parents, milling director Egon Oertel and his wife Margarete (n√©e Wittek) westwards, initially to Gransee in Brandenburg, then continuing to Triptis in Thuringia which was captured by US forces rather than the Soviets. When Thuringia fell under Soviet control in the course of the Potsdam Agreement, the flight continued by horse and carriage, further westwards to √ñhringen in southwestern W√ºrttemberg. Goetz's father was able to support the family through his hobby, genealogy. His hometown, lying east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, was transferred to Poland after the war. =Education= After the Abitur at the Robert-Mayer-High School in Heilbronn and first work experiences in the private economy at the energy corporation AEG in Stuttgart, Oertel commenced his studies of physics at the Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel in 1953. A son of a member of the Corps (student fraternity) Masovia, he equally sought membership in the Kiel Corps Palaiomarchia-Masovia, where he sustained in four fencing duels.K√∂sener Corpslisten 1996, 114, 61 Physicist in the US Goetz followed his supervisor of his doctoral thesis to the US in 1957 with a Fulbright stipend, and got a position as physics research associate at the University of Maryland. He married Brigitte Beckmann in 1960, and became neighbor as well as friends with Karl-Ludwig Stellmacher, a German ‚Äì American mathematician. After his successful PhD promotion he was hired by NASA in January 1963 at their Langley Research Center as a researcher. The agency promoted his naturalization to US citizenship and provided him with responsibility over a current research project. He had to convince the NASA and General Electric engineers that the project was unviable and had to be restructured substantially. At the same time, his experimental research results from his PhD thesis became published and resulted in the application for two patents. =Solar physics= In 1967, the NASA HQ offered Goetz Oertel a senior position in Washington, D.C. and thus enabled a continuation of his theoretical work. When he was finally named leader of the program of the ATM of Skylab, consequentially becoming responsible for continuously increasing roles and functions, and finally was promoted Chief of Solar Physics, he had to come to an end with his experimental work, albeit successfully. =Nuclear energy= In 1974, the Nixon administration drafted its Federal Executive Development Program, with the goal to reduce the isolation of the Federal ministries, specifically among the higher level civil servants, the so-called super-grades. As a consequence, management skills gained a higher weight than the academic knowledge of the subject matter. Around 8.000 mid-level civil servants had to apply for 25 positions. Oertel applied successfully and was offered ‚Äûfree choice‚Äú among the Federal ministries. After the introduction course in Charlottesville, South Carolina he became, for six months each, scientific advisor to the President and at the Office of Management and Budget of the President's Office ‚Äì Department for Space, Science and Energy. In 1975, he was appointed Head of the Astronomy Program at the Ministry of Science, and in 1976 Chief of Staff of the Assistant Administrator for nuclear energy. From 1977 to 1984, he served as director for nuclear energy facilities (including nuclear waste- and secondary products of the defense sector) in the newly created Department of Energy. New positions at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina in Albuquerque brought responsibilities for 32,000 employees and an overall budget of USD 3 billion. =Astronomy= Oertel returned to the Ministry of Energy in 1985 as deputy assistant. Dealing with the consequences of the Challenger space shuttle accident and the Chernobyl disaster, the appointment to President and Chief Executive of AURA came at a suitable moment. AURA operated the Hubble Space Telescope, space- and solar observatories in Arizona, New Mexico and Chile, and, more recently, also the Gemini Observatorys in Hawaii and Chile. After thirteen successful years at this position, Oertel finally declined a five-year renewal of his contract. Honorations Oertel remains an active member of The National Academy of Sciences, and continues his work for various foundations and universities, as well as for ministries of science in North- and South America. The National Academies elected him as Associate for life. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers honored him with the Dixy Lee Ray Prize. Finally, the International Astronomic Union baptized an asteroid after him: 5074 Goetzoertel. Private life Oertel and his wife have one daughter and one son.

With around 140 members, the organization advocates for the conservation of the watershed in Macon County and its surrounding counties, helps protect and restore at-risk properties in the watershed, and maintains a biomonitoring program that charts the quality of aquatic life and biodiversity of the river.  History  In 1993, citizens, local government officials, and scientists attending a local watershed conference in Franklin recognized that accelerating growth and development were impacting the health of the Little Tennessee River watershed, and decided that they needed a strategy to protect water quality, aquatic life, and biodiversity in the watershed. The 200-plus people who participated decided that an organization was needed to lead the effort, and the LTWA was born.Little Tennessee Watershed Association Strategic Plan Executive Summary, 2009-2010 From 1994 onward, the LTWA operated as an all-volunteer organization under the Southwestern North Carolina Resource Conservation and Development Council, part of the US Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service. In 1998, the LTWA hired its first paid staff member. It earned 501c(3) nonprofit status in 2001.  Activity in the watershed  The LTWA focuses broadly on biomonitoring, education, restoration, and advocacy. = Biomonitoring = The LTWA's biomonitoring program is headed by Dr. William McLarney, who began monitoring the Little Tennessee watershed in 1990, before the LTWA was founded. The data from this program provides a picture of the biodiversity of the watershed over the past 20 years, and is the largest fish-based biomonitoring database in the world for any comparably sized watershed. Throughout the program's history, over 2,000 volunteers have participated in field work and data collection at over 150 sites around the watershed, and data from the program appears in the Southern Appalachian Information Node database, making it accessible all over the world. = Education = The LTWA has provided informal courses as part of volunteer biomonitoring activities for individuals and groups from many organizations including Franklin High School, Macon Middle School, Upward Bound, Outward Bound, NCCAT, The Mountain Retreat Center, SAFC, interns at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, and many others. It played a major role in creating a Biomonitoring Curriculum for Macon County schools in partnership with Coweeta Hydrologic Lab and has worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority's \\"Kids in the Creek\\" program. It has also published several guides and publications about the watershed, including A Field Guide to the Fishes of the Upper Little Tennessee Watershed, a 71-page illustrated booklet about 68 species of fish in the watershed, Sediment in our Watershed, a 4-page brochure funded by the Little Tennessee Nonpoint Source with information about the problems of sediment, and The State of the Streams in the Upper Little Tennessee Watershed: A Report on Water Quality and Habitat Trends, 1990-2002 , which uses data from the biomonitoring program to illustrate the overall health of the watershed. = Restoration = In the past decade, the LTWA has partnered with the Macon Soil and Water Conservation District and local landowners to perform voluntary restoration projects on more than 3.4 miles of eroded stream bank, plant more than 10.3 miles of vegetative buffer, and install 4.6 miles of livestock fence along local waterways. The organization also collaborates with the Land Trust for the Little Tennessee (also based in Franklin) to purchase, protect and restore at-risk tracts of land in the watershed.  Tessentee Farm  In 2008, the LTWA coordinated a volunteer effort to restore part of a 64-acre tract of bottomland and river bluff land at the junction of Tessentee Creek and the Little Tennessee River owned by the LTLT known as the Tessentee Farm back to its condition prior to the addition of a man-made pond and other landscaping.  The Watauga Restoration Project  In 2006, the LTWA was awarded a grant to study the spotfin chub, designated as a threatened species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Staff aquatic biologist and biomonitoring program leader William McLarney identified several potential barriers to fish passage between the Lake Emory Dam in Franklin to the Fontana reservoir in Swain County that appeared to be contributing to the decline of the spotfin chub in the watershed. This research led to a multi agency effort by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the North Carolina Division of Water Quality, USFWS, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, NRCS, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, and North Carolina State University to assess barriers to aquatic organism passage through the Little Tennessee and its tributaries. By 2007, several potential locations for restoration efforts (mostly located on private property) had been identified. The LTWA requested funds to pursue a restoration project along Watauga Creek in Macon County, and received a federal stimulus grant through the USFWS's Partners for Fish & Wildlife Program funds program (part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009). It then collaborated with local contractors on dam and culvert removal, temporary flow diversion around the dam during construction and some streambank stabilization, and built new free-spanning bridges that wouldn't block fish passage. The project is still ongoing, with the LTWA organizing volunteer groups to plant trees, sow grass seed, and lay down straw mulch. = Advocacy = The LTWA provides a pro-conservation voice in local politics, playing an active role on Macon County's Watershed Council, and advocates for the protection of the Little Tennessee watershed.  Rabun County Water Reclamation Facility  The organization has been a vocal opponent of a recent request by the commissioners of Rabun County, Georgia, for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division that would allow the county to discharge up to 2 million gallons per day of treated wastewater into the Little Tennessee. The proposed Rabun County Water Reclamation Facility, located at a former Fruit of the Loom plant in the headwaters of the watershed, would upgrade the Fruit of the Loom building's existing treatment plant, which was formerly an industrial wastewater facility, allowing it to treat domestic and industrial wastewater and act as the county's municipal wastewater treatment plant. The LTWA outlined its primary concerns in comments submitted by the Southern Environmental Law Center on their behalf to the Georgia EPD during the 30-day permit draft comment period, calling for a public hearing to address whether the permit should be granted and to ensure that it contains appropriate provisions to protect downstream users of the river. This prompted Macon County commissioners to vote unanimously to submit a letter to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division echoing the LTWA's call for a public hearing and highlighting concerns about the permit, including \\"interbasin transfer implications, the impact on a section of the Little Tennessee already listed as impaired, the town's plans to use the Little Tennessee as a public water supply, concerns raised about the use of chlorine for disinfection.\\" When the Georgia EPD agreed and scheduled a public hearing in the Rabun County courthouse, executive director Jenny Sanders urged Macon County citizens and officials to attend. The entire five-member Macon board of commissioners attended the meeting, as well as Franklin alderman Bob Scott, county manager Jack Horton, soil and erosion control officer Matt Mason, Director of Permitting, Planning and Development Jack Morgan and county planner Derek Roland.  Needmore Road improvements  The LTWA has also publicly opposed North Carolina Department of Transportation's proposal to pave and widen 3.3 miles of Needmore Road between Byrd road in Macon County and existing pavement in Swain County. The proposal to expand the road, which runs along the Little Tennessee River near the 4,500-acre protected Needmore Tract owned by the LTLT, was met with widespread opposition from the public. The LTWA submitted a letter to the NC DOT and the US Army Corps of Engineers outlining its concerns about the proposal, claiming that proposed method of widening the road‚Äîblasting through the acidic rock that borders it‚Äîwould have a negative impact on the Little Tennessee and those who live near it. When the NC DOT granted Macon County commissioners' request for a public hearing on the road improvements, the LTWA urged both its members and the public to come out in opposition. The NCDOT is reconsidering its plans for the road's expansion, and has scheduled a post-hearing meeting for November 30, 2010, to \\"review every comment received and (to) make a decision about what the next steps are.\\"  Organizational structure  The LTWA's board of directors comprises: * Stacy Guffey, Chair * Stephanie Laseter, Vice Chair * Dick Heywood, Treasurer * Sarah Weresuk, Secretary * Kathy Tinsley * Chad Boniface * Ed Haight * Dr. Don Dewhurst * Vic Greene * Ryan Griffith The LTWA's staff members are: * Jenny Sanders, Executive Director * Dr. Bill McLarney, Biomonitoring Program Director * Jason Meador, Watershed Program Coordinator * Sharon Willard, Bookkeeper  References   External links * Eenorthcarolina.org * Ltwa.org * Geonames.usgs.gov * Greenjobspider.com * Rankdirectory.org * Ltlt.org * Faqs.org * Ctnc.org Environmental organizations based in North Carolina Water organizations in the United States ","title":"Little Tennessee Watershed Association"},{"id":"28928962","text":"Gudleppa Hallikeri (1906‚Äì1972) was an Indian freedom fighter who is a native of Hosaritti in Haveri district of Karnataka state.

Development Kawasaki was the last of the big four Japanese manufacturers to start making motorcycles. In 1960 it bought a share in the Meguro motorcycle company that since the 1930s had made four-stroke singles up to 500 cc and later twins up to 650 cc for the Japanese and south-east Asian markets. From 1963 Kawasaki took complete control of Meguro, and the Meguro model K 500 cc four-stroke parallel-twin was re-badged as a Kawasaki. The Kawasaki W1 650 cc (actually 624 cc) four-stroke twin was developed from the Meguro K series, which Meguro had developed from a BSA A7 under license. Kawasaki developed the lighter Kawasaki A1 Samurai in 1966. It was quickly followed by the larger bore model, the A7 Avenger, which is similar to the Samurai. Sharing all of the Samurai components aside from pistons, piston rings, different mufflers with reverse cones, it also featured a race developed oiling system called Injectolube. Oil was not only injected in with the petrol as on the 250 but was also fed to the main bearings. The crankcases and crank were also redesigned for use with the Injectolube system. The A7SS Avenger has a crossover dual exhaust mounted on the left side and just below the seat. Other than exhaust system, there were no other changes between the standard A7 and A7SS. Engine The engine was advanced for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised the advantages of rotary disc valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors. The A7 Avenger had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and in line with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the disc cover. The rotary disc valve was housed inboard of that cover. In 1969 the ignition system was equipped with a capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system then increased the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.

The idea for the museum was conceived in 1995. The Museum was founded in 1997 by Leonard Garment, Counsel to two U.S. Presidents, and an accomplished jazz saxophonist, Abraham D. Sofaer, a former U.S. District Judge who gave the initial gift in honor of his brother-in-law Richard J. Scheuer, Jr., and matching funds from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. For more than 15 years the museum was based in East Harlem at 104 East 126th Street. On February 1, 2016, the Museum re-opened in a new space on the ground floor of 58 West 129th Street in Central Harlem with approximately 1900 square feet of exhibition space.Chinen, Nate (March 30, 2016), \\"The National Jazz Museum in Harlem Finds a Permanent Home\\", The New York Times.Pengelly, Martin (April 2, 2016) \\"Harlem's reopened National Jazz Museum can see for Mies and Miles\\", The Guardian. Programs and exhibits The National Jazz Museum in Harlem's Visitors Center has featured exhibits such as The Ghosts of Harlem by American music producer, photographer, and author Hank O'Neal. The show included images of Harlem jazz legends that O'Neal had the chance to interview and photograph for his book of the same name. The Visitors Center also houses books, recordings, and documentaries for guests to enjoy as well as photographs of contemporary jazz musicians. The museum hosts weekly programs such as the Harlem Speaks lecture series and Jazz for Curious Listeners sessions in which jazz novices and experts alike listen and learn about rare jazz recordings. The museum hosts events and programs at jazz venues and other museums such as the Rubin Museum of Art for the Harlem in the Himalayas concert series. Jonathan Batiste has been working with the museum since 2008 when he helped create the program Jazz Is: Now! in which his Stay Human band plays and \\"he deconstructs jazz, walking people through the theory and history of the music, often with the help of guests.\\" Batiste was named associate artistic director of the museum in 2012. The Savory Collection In August 2010 The National Jazz Museum in Harlem acquired nearly 1,000 discs of recorded radio broadcasts made by audio engineer William Savory in the midst of the swing era in the 1930s. The collection includes performances by jazz luminaries such as Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and Benny Goodman. Savory had access to bigger, slower-playing aluminum and acetate records and he was able to record much longer clips, capturing extended live shows and jam sessions that many thought would be lost forever. The recordings are being digitized by Brooklyn-based recording engineer Doug Pomeroy, a specialist in audio restoration. The transformation involves cleaning, correcting pitch, removing extraneous noise, mixing and mastering. The Savory Collection is being made available for purchase and portions of this collection have been made available for digital download through iTunes, as of May 2017 three volumes are available. Mosaic Records also released a limited-edition 6-CD set with selections from the collection.https://www.mosaicrecords.com/discography.asp?number=266-MD-CD Board of Directors  * Jonathan Scheuer, Chairman * Abraham D.

Candidates demonstrate competencies on the application form, and then in the interview, which in this case is known as a competency-based interview. The process of competency-based recruitment is intended to be fairer than other recruitment processes by clearly laying down the required competencies and then testing them in such a way that the recruiter has little discretion to favour one candidate over another; the process assumes high recruiter discretion is undesirable. As a result of its perceived fairness, the process is popular in public services. Competency-based recruitment is highly focused on the candidates' story-telling abilities as an indication of competency, and disfavours other indications of a candidate's skills and potential, such as references. Core Competencies Core competencies are the set of skills which are crucial to a business, for them to gain a competitive advantage in their market. Senior managers are unable to manage every single aspect of their business, including the competencies needed to maintain a strong business. This means that they must come up with a set of competencies which truly affect their competitive advantage, as this will save them time in the long run when it comes to hiring employees. Hamel and Prahalad‚Äôs main idea was that over time companies will develop key areas of expertise which are unique to that company and crucial for their long term growth. They said the core competencies should not be seen as being fixed; these competencies should change in response to changes in the company‚Äôs business environment. This is because over time, the business will evolve and new opportunities will arise and so the same must happen to the core competencies. Hamel and Prahalad came up with three questions which businesses must consider when identifying their core competencies: # Are the competencies difficult for competitors to imitate? # Do the competencies provide potential access to a wide variety of markets? # Do the competencies make a large contribution to the consumer benefits? Elements of a competency-based job description Key elements of the job description are: * Job title ‚Äì title that is used to refer to the employees position in the company e.g. Project Manager * Relevance of position ‚Äì statement about how the position supports the company (with its business plan and objectives) * Major responsibilities ‚Äì list of the main activities that the individual must undertake on a day-to-day basis * Critical criteria ‚Äì standards and qualities that candidates must have in order to be considered for the job * Preferred criteria ‚Äì qualities that the company would like candidate to possess but are not crucial in the day-to-day activities of the job * Reports to ‚Äì who their manager is Purpose There are 4 main reasons why competency-based job descriptions are crucial to businesses: # They provide crucial information for assigning the correct title and pay grade for the job # They make it easier to recruit candidates as the process becomes more efficient # Means potential candidates have a complete understanding of the duties and responsibilities they are to undertake # Finally, the competencies identify the essential functions of the job Job descriptions and competencies allow potential employees to identify the skills, qualities, experience and training needed for a certain job. The information in the job description and competencies is included in the performance requirements which form the performance reviews. Businesses rely on job descriptions and competencies to create training programs for their employees whereas employees use these to obtain the skills required for them to get a promotion or pay rise! Small businesses Small businesses struggle a lot more than larger businesses when it comes to employing people for jobs. It is much better for them to use competency-based job descriptions as they differ from standard job descriptions because they emphasize the worker rather than the work. Competency-based job descriptions decrease the chances of the employer hiring the wrong person for the job. To ensure that staff are placed properly within a small business, they must create a detailed job description. For a small business it is crucial that they hire the right number of people. This is because, if they hire too many people it could lead to money being wasted on staff income (wages are the highest costs to business). As well as other issues, as the saying goes: ‚Äútoo many cooks spoil the broth‚Äù! On the other hand, if they hire too few people, it could lead to inefficiencies and large costs for the small business in the long run. The best approach for small businesses will be to have a job preview, assess whether individuals are capable of learning the skills needed by the company. This will help filter out those candidates who will not be suitable for the job. If possible, small businesses should use experienced individuals in the hiring process, these individuals will know if the future employee will fit into the culture of the company as well as if they possess the relevant skills. Competency Life Cycle The competency life cycle consists of 4 phases which aim to develop and enhance individual and organisational competencies. The different phases are: # Competency mapping ‚Äì this phase is there to provide the company with a summary of all the crucial competencies needed in order to fulfil its targets (outlined in the business plan), outline the job requirements and the group needs. This phase also defines the required skill level for each job profile # Competency diagnosis ‚Äì this is based on the current employees in the company. This outlines the present proficiency level each employee possesses. The company will perform a ‚Äòskill gap analysis‚Äô, which defines the gap between the skills the employee currently has compared to the competencies needed for their job # Competency development ‚Äì this phase deals with development of training/activities the company provides to employees to fill the skill gaps found in the previous phase # Monitoring of competencies ‚Äì an analysis of the results of the competency development phase Competency Analysis In order to conduct thorough competency analysis, one has to gather information from various sources. These sources are known as job content experts (JCEs) and they have a good understanding of positions in companies. JCEs are usually the people who manage the position one is looking to fill. The first step of the competency analysis is to accumulate detailed descriptions of the tasks which make up the job: ‚Äòtask analyses‚Äô. This is done through a range of data collection methods: * Job observation: observe people already in the job and ask them to describe what they do etc. * Incumbent interviews: conduct interviews with people already in the job, asking each individual the same set of questions. The questions should be based on their key responsibilities, problems they need to solve/ difficulties they face, skills they feel are needed for success etc. * Critical incidents meetings: meetings with JCEs, getting them to provide examples of times employees have been highly efficient or inefficient * Competency vision meetings: meetings with ‚Äòvisionaries‚Äô, those who know about the future of the company. The reason for these meetings is because the hiring manager is looking for an employee who will stay for the long term and an employee who will contribute to the future success of the company Once the data from these various sources has been analysed, a list of the competencies needed for the job description can come together, completing the competency analysis. Advantages There are many benefits of using competencies in organisations: * Competencies help a business distinguish their top performers and their average ones. This is useful information for managers when it comes to giving out bonuses * As competencies are linked to business objectives or business strategies, aligning the two is more effective and convenient for the business, making it more streamlined * Identifying and using core competencies to create goods & services results in major contributions to the companies competitiveness * Businesses who use the competency-based approach will generally have a more flexible workforce, with individuals who are well trained and this should result in a successful performance from those employees * Staff turnover is reduced if competency- based job descriptions are used, as candidates whom are best suited for the role are hired =Criticisms= However, there are also some negative aspects of competency-based job descriptions. They can be time consuming, as it takes a long time to gather the data needed to decide which competencies are relevant for the job profile. This process can also be very costly and not all businesses may have the funds available to carry out the competency analysis. The analysis also requires staff with specific skills, which certain businesses may lack. Best practices Having established the competency profiles for groups and roles, organizations can use the competencies as the standards for assessing candidates throughout the screening and selection process as well as advertising and communicating the organization‚Äôs requirements to potential applicants. Competencies support recruitment and selection by: * Providing bona fide, validated, fair and unbiased standards against which to assess applicant competencies to perform in the targeted role / job. * Improving the transparency of the selection process by clearly communicating the behaviours employees must display for success in the role / job. * Contributing to the design of a well-articulated, efficient and effective recruitment and selection processes. * Creating efficiencies by providing re-usable selection tools and processes (e.g., question banks for interviews and reference-checking organized by competency; template interview and reference checking guides for roles / jobs within the organization; targeted role plays, work simulations, in-basket assessments; etc.) * Providing explicit, clear and transparent criteria on which to give candidates feedback on their performance in the selection process (e.g., input for future learning and development; etc.) * Providing standards for evaluating the success of the selection process ‚Äì e.g., correlating the results of the selection process with competency-based on-the-job performance. Some of the common benchmark competency-based practices in Recruitment and Selection include: * Notices of job requirements ‚Äì A template is developed to define how competencies will be reflected in notices regarding the requirements of jobs to be filled. As the competency profiles are completed, sample notices are developed for the varied types of jobs/ roles. . * Interview and Reference Checking Guides ‚Äì Template interview and reference checking guides are developed for varied types of jobs/ roles, including instructions and rating guides. These are made available to hiring managers and HR Advisors. * Template Interview and Reference Checking Guides ‚Äì Template interview and reference checking guides are developed for roles/career streams and levels within Occupational Groups including instructions and rating guides. These are made available to hiring managers and HR Advisors. * Competency-based Track Record / Portfolio Reviews ‚Äì Track record / portfolio reviews allow employees / applicants to document their past experiences and accomplishments that relate to the competency requirements for positions within the organization. Once completed, trained evaluators score the extent to which the required competencies are demonstrated in the written examples using standardized scoring criteria. Typically, the candidate / employee also provides references who can attest to the validity of the examples provided. Results can be used as part of the staffing process and / or for other purposes (e.g., competency gap analysis for Learning and Development; Succession Management; HR Planning). * Other Competency-based Assessment Methodologies ‚Äì A variety of other competency-based assessment methodologies can be incorporated into the selection process, including In-basket assessments, role plays or simulations of workplace situations that the employee will encounter, multi-source input (as appropriate), etc. When designing and implementing any methodology, it is important that it be defensible (i.e., reliable, fair, valid and unbiased). * Training on Competency-based Selection ‚Äì Managers must have the knowledge and skills to be able to apply the various competency-based assessment methodologies noted above to arrive at valid selection decisions. Likewise, employees must be able to participate effectively to provide an accurate picture of the competencies they possess. Finally, both managers and HR professionals must be able to establish selection processes that are both efficient and effective (i.e., reliable, fair, valid and unbiased). All of this requires targeted training / orientation programs to ensure that all stakeholders have the necessary skills. Implementation stages As competency profiles are developed for varied job groups, the following implementation stages are suggested for their use in recruitment and selection on a corporate-wide basis. Stage 1: * Define the policies and decision-rules for using competencies in the recruitment and selection processes * Identify considerations / guidelines for including information on competencies in notices of job requirements * Develop sample notices of job requirements as the competency profiles become available for use. * Customize or build an interview / reference checking question bank organized by competencies included in the competency profiles. * Customize or build other competency- based tools or processes (e.g., track-record reviews) that can be used across a number of occupational groups. Stage 2: * As the competency profiles are completed for the job groups, develop and implement recruitment, and selection processes consistent with policy and tools / templates defined in Stage 1. Review and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of these processes and adjust policies, procedures, templates, etc., as required. * Plan for and train managers and HR personnel on appropriate competency-based interviewing approaches (e.g., behavioral interviewing; situational interviewing). This training should be just-in-time ‚Äì i.e., as competency profiles become available for the different job groups. * Plan for, design and implement an orientation / training program for employees on how to participate in a competency-based recruitment and selection as new processes are being implemented). * Collect data on the effectiveness of the new recruitment and selection process (e.g., correlate results of selection process with on-job or training performance results) and make adjustments to the process, as required.

Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate by Emory University in 1978. =In Seoul= In 1968 or 1969, Lee returned to Korea to serve as professor of Political Science at Korea's top university, Seoul National University through 1973, and again served in this capacity after his return from Harvard circa 1974. He served as professor at Seoul National until being tapped to serve as a government minister in 1988. Political career Following thirty-three years in the academic world (around half in the U.S. and half in Seoul), Lee Hong-Koo entered the world of active politics and government when, in 1988, he was appointed Minister of Unification by then-recently elected President Roh Tae- Woo. In 1991, Lee was appointed South Korean Ambassador to the United Kingdom, also by Roh Tae-Woo, and from 1994 to 1995 Lee served as the 28th Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea under President Kim Young-Sam (though as Korea is a strong presidential system, the position of Prime Minister is subordinate to the presidency). At this time, Lee was politically independent of any party. =Entrance into the New Korea Party= In 1996, upon the advice of (then-)President Kim Young-Sam, Lee Hong-Koo formally entered the New Korea Party to run as a candidate for that party in the then-upcoming National Assembly elections. The New Korea Party was a rebranded version of the coalition of conservative and moderate forces that had come together in 1990 with the mergers of Kim Young-Sam's centrist party (core support area: Pusan and South Kyongsang), Kim Jong-Pil's (core support area: Chungcheong), and Roh Tae-Woo‚Äôs conservative party (core support area: Taegu and North Kyongsang), the latter of which was the clearest successor to the military-oriented regimes of the 1960s to 1980s. The party‚Äôs rebranding as ‚ÄòNew Korea‚Äô came following the departure of Kim Jong-Pil's party from this coalition in 1995. (The New Korea Party was renamed the Grand National Party in 1998 and essentially endured through the mid 2010s, with Kim Jong-Pil and his followers also returning by 2006, until the political crisis of 2016 under Park Geun-Hye caused severe divisions that broke apart the successor Saenuri party.) Lee Hong-Koo was elected a member of the National Assembly in the April 1996 general election, as the second name on the national party list for the New Korea Party. As Korea then had 47 seats to distribute on a proportional basis at the time, the high slot that the party gave Lee guaranteed that he would enter the National Assembly. The New Korea Party itself won 139 of 299 seats in the election, far above its rivals' individual totals of 79 seats (Kim Dae- Jung's party) and 50 seats (Kim Jong-Pil's right-wing breakaway party). =Rapid political rise, presidential speculation= Lee rose quickly in 1996, becoming a member of the Executive Committee of the New Korea party, and then the leader of the party itself. Lee was, at this time, widely considered a possible successor to President Kim Young-Sam (whose term of office was February 1993 to February 1998). In 1995 and early 1996, Lee served as Chairman of the World Cup Bidding Committee, which successfully lobbied for South Korea to co-host the World Cup in 2002 (FIFA selected Korea/Japan in May 1996). In December 1996, after the government quickly forced through a revised labor law despite widespread opposition across the country, Lee Hong-Koo resigned from his top leadership position in the New Korea Party but remained in the party. Following the inset of the 1997 Asian economic crisis, the opposition National Congress for New Politics candidate Kim Dae-Jung won the presidential election in December 1997 and took office in February 1998, Lee Hong-Koo was still a sitting National Assembly member from the party, now rebranded the Grand National Party (as of November 1997). =Ambassador to the United States= On March 24, 1998, President Kim Dae-Jung nominated Lee Hong- Koo to be South Korean Ambassador to the United States. As Lee Hong-Koo was serving in a top advisory capacity for the Grand National Party, the decision to appoint him ambassador to the U.S. was seen to signal a change in the nature of Korean politics. The Foreign Ministry explained that the nomination of a relatively important official of the previous government ‚Äúshows our intention to pursue bipartisan foreign policy.‚Äù The concurrent nomination of Lee Sung-Soo as Unification Minister, also a former prime minister under the previous government, was seen to confirm this attitude. Lee Hong-Koo served as the South Korean Ambassador to the United States for two and a half years, from May 1998 through August 2000, when he was replaced by Yang Sung-chul (serving August 2000 to April 2003). Lee's tenure as ambassador was during the \\"Sunshine Policy\\", when apparently-improving inter-Korean relations led President Kim Dae-Jung to become a serious contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, which he won in October 2000. Post-politics career Lee Hong-Koo was actively involved in government and diplomacy for 12 years (1988 to 2000) and active electoral politics in the National Assembly for two years (1996‚Äì1998). Following his return to private life in 2000, Lee became active as a newspaper columnist and in the think tank and policy world, becoming a member, among other organizations, of the elite Club of Madrid of former heads of state and government, and as a board member of the Seoul Forum, and founded a think tank himself (EAI). =Founding the 'East Asia Institute' think tank= In May 2002, Lee Hong-Koo founded the East Asia Institute (generally called \\"EAI\\" after its English acronym. Korean name: ÎèôÏïÑÏãúÏïÑÏó∞Íµ¨Ïõê) as an independent, non- profit, political- and foreign-policy think tank based in Seoul. By the 2010s, EAI consistently ranks in ‚Äúthe top 100 think tanks\\" among 6,000 think tanks around the world and its research and institutional model has been benchmarked by nascent research institutions in developing countries.\\"EAI Ranked among Top 100 Think Tanks in the World,\\"] press release, January 24, 2013. (Accessed July 7, 2017.) Lee Hong-Koo served as the Chairman of the Board at EAI for exactly ten years, retiring from the post in May 2012,\\"EAI Welcome New Chairman,\\" press release, June 2012. (Accessed July 7, 2017.) the same month as his 78th birthday. Ha Young-Sun took over as Chairman following Lee's retirement, a position he retains as of 2017. =Journalism and journalistic 'stalking' case= Lee wrote articles for the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper over several years. In 2011, the left-wing academic Chin Jung-kwon caused a small sensation by apparently \\"stalking\\" Lee by posting his own articles in Hankyoreh, a progressive South Korean daily, on the same day as Lee's columns were posted. Chin's \\"stalking\\" started precisely on April 11, 2011. He followed Lee's columns for 10 consecutive postings up to October 14, 2011. Chin's columns were posted about 20 hours later on the same day as Lee's columns were posted. Their columns are listed below.2011.04.11 00:26 [Ïù¥ÌôçÍµ¨ ÏπºÎüº] ÎåÄÌÜµÎ†πÏùò Í≥µÏïΩ Í∑∏Î¶¨Í≥† ÌóåÎ≤ï <Ïù¥ÌôçÍµ¨ ÏπºÎüº> ÎåÄÌÜµÎ†πÏùò Í≥µÏïΩ Í∑∏Î¶¨Í≥† ÌóåÎ≤ï Ï§ëÏïôÏùºÎ≥¥ 2011.04.112011.04.11 20:14 [Ïïº!

Cork in 1880, the childhood home of Clo Graves Biography Graves was born on 3 June 1863 at Buttevant Castle, Co. Cork, the third daughter of Major William Henry Graves (1825‚Äì1892) of the 18th Royal Irish Regiment and Antoinette, daughter of Captain George Anthony Deane of Harwich. She was a second cousin of Alfred Perceval Graves (1846‚Äì1931) ‚Äì son of Rt. Rev. Charles Graves (1812‚Äì1899), the mathematician Anglican Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Ahadoe- father of the poet Robert Graves (1895‚Äì1985), and his brother Charles Patrick Graves (1899‚Äì1971).Sir Bernard Burke: Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Ireland, 3rd. edition, London 1912, p. 275Clo Graves at npg.org.uk At the age of nine, she moved with her family to England from their Irish home. She had seen a good deal of barrack life, and at Alvington Lodge, Granada Street, Southsea,London Gazette, 6 January 1874, p. 82 where they went to live, she acquired a large knowledge of both services in the circle of naval and military friends they made there, and this knowledge years afterward she turned to good account in her novel Between Two Thieves. Educated at a Convent in Lourdes, she converted to Catholicism and came to London where she studied art at Bloomsbury. She was an unusual figure in London society, wearing her hair short, affecting a masculine manner and cut of costume, and smoking cigarettes in public when such characteristics were considered eccentric. In 1884, Clotilde Graves became an art student and worked at the British Museum galleries and the Royal Female School of Art, helping to support herself by journalism, among other things drawing little pen-and-ink grotesques for the comic papers. She abandoned art and took an engagement in a travelling theatrical company. In 1888 her first chance as a dramatist came. She was again in London, working vigorously at journalism, when some one was needed to write extra lyrics for a pantomime then in preparation. A letter of recommendation from an editor to the manager ended in Miss Clo Graves writing the pantomime of Puss in Boots. Later a tragedy by her, Nitocris, was produced at Drury Lane, and another of her plays, The Mother of Three, proved not only a literary, but also a financial success.THE BOOKMAN for February 1913 (Volume XXXVI, pp. 595‚Äì6) In 1900 she lived in Hampstead and possessed a very fine collection of Chinese and Japanese trophies. She was an enthusiastic fly-fisher and rode a tricycle.The King of Illustrated Newspapers, 3 March 1900, p. 264 Embarking on a literary career, Edmund Yates thought her stories ideal for his magazine World, and she also contributed to Punch. She became a successful London and New York playwright who enjoyed considerable literary acclaim in the first decades of the 20th century. With the actress Gertrude Kingston she wrote the play A Matchmaker, which gained a certain notoriety when it was criticised for comparing marriage to prostitution. In 1911, at the age of forty six, her first novel was published under the pseudonym of Richard Dehan. The significant thing was that in publishing her novel, The Dop Doctor (American title: One Braver Thing), Clotilde Graves chose the pen name of Richard Dehan, although she was already known as a writer (chiefly for the theatre) under her own name. It was made into a film of the same name in 1915 by Fred Paul. The film gave considerable offence in South Africa due to the harsh portrayal of English and Dutch characters. It was eventually banned under the Defence of the Realm Act. The story's protagonist is a drunken and disgraced medic who eventually makes his way to South Africa where he redeems his honour at the Siege of Mafeking. Albert G√©rard, in his European-language writing in Sub Saharan Africa , regards the book's description of the siege of Mafeking \\"as a heroic justification of British Imperial strategy and the vindication of a belief in the righteousness and superiority of the British cause. The Dop Doctor contains pro-Jingo arguments of the type which offers the stereotypical portrait of the Boer as backward and despicably primitive, and the black man as a shadow figure behind the civilizing foreground, an appendage of an argument over what to do with his labour\\". The incidentals of the novel, however, should not distract from its primary objective of tracing a story of redemption through expiatory suffering and kenosis, a subject much explored by writers, in several European languages, connected with the literary renouveau catholique movement. The Dop Doctor was followed, two years later, by Between Two Thieves. This novel has as a leading character Florence Nightingale under the name of Ada Merling. The story was at first to have been called \\"The Lady with the Lamp\\"; but the author delayed it for a year and subjected it to a complete rewriting, the result of a new and enlarged conception of the story. She died at the convent of Our Lady of Lourdes at Hatch End, Middlesex, on 3 December 1932.

Overview  The principal evidence cited for the existence of \\"Wiki-constitutionalism\\" is the sheer number of constitutions which have existed in Latin America when compared with other regions of the globe. If one looks at fully restructured rewrites (as opposed to amendments), \\"the Dominican Republic has had 32 separate constitutions since its independence in 1821.

The university is situated in the former barracks of the Cavalier-Guard Regiment where the university was founded. Description Military Engineering-Technical University is a higher military educational institution preparing officers of engineering and building specialties for all branches of troops and navy. It is located in Saint Petersburg where the university was founded, near Engineers Castle, Summer Garden, Suvorov Museum, Tauride Palace, and Smolny Convent. Military Engineering-Technical University has six faculties preparing specialists in the following branches: * Military construction, * Military energy resource engineering, * Naval base construction, * Sanitary engineering, * Mechanization of construction, * Special for civil. The university trains experts in the field of construction of buildings and special structures, engineering and technical systems and power industry. It has a modern experimental base for testing various thermal-mechanical and power equipment, structures and construction materials, and carries out research and development activities. It provides military university trained officers for all the Engineering Troops of Russia, a counterpart of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Also, possibly teaching of foreigners.  History  Suvorov Military Memorial Museum near VITU This is one of Saint Petersburg's eldest Higher Military engineering schools, its history (as Higher learning institution) beginning in 1810.[Stephen Timoshenko - Engineering Education in Russia, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1959] The Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University was founded as the Saint Petersburg military engineering School in 1810 on the base of the military school of engineering conductors (engineering of non-commissioned officers), after addition of officers classes and application of five-year term of teaching. In 1819 was renamed as the Main military engineering School. How Stephen Timoshenko wrote in a book \\"Engineering Education in Russia\\" the system of Higher learning institution of five-year Education of Main military engineering school was used later on the example of Institute of railway Engineers by all Russia and develops until now. This engineering school was alma mater of graduate for Fyodor Dostoyevsky.Anna Dostoyevskaya Flashbacks [1925]. M.: Artistic literature, 1981. In 1855, officers classes of the Nikolaevsky Engineering School was reformed as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy. After 1917, numerous transformations of Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and Engineering school were undertaken (but Higher learning institution survived). It was renamed as the Military-Engineering Academy, and then as Military-Technical Academy. But in 1932 followed the unsuccessful attempt of moving the Engineering Faculty to Moscow; it was completed later as the Sea Faculty returned to Leningrad in 1939 (As a result, from the base Saint Petersburg Engineering Higher learning institution was separated a new Moscow military Engineering-administrative academy). Only Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov could counteract Joseph Stalin\`s policy against the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and school in 1939.*Information page, including memoirs He ordered that the university be revived, and that the Marine Engineering faculty be returned from Moscow.* –°–∞–π—Ç, –ø–æ—Å–≤—è—â—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ù. –ì. –ö—É–∑–Ω–µ—Ü–æ–≤—É The attempts at bureaucratic movings (or Stalin's unfavorable attitude, 1932‚Äì1939) of the Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers can be examined in the historical context of the \\"Military Case\\" and Great Purge, on the eve of war against fascism.*List of accused of \\"Military Case\\" Also, Stalin's dislike of Fyodor Dostoyevsky was the reason of the unfavorable attitude against a university (because Stalin did not understand Dostoyevsky) . There were destructive consequences of some degradation for the pedagogical and scientific forces of Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers, but it was successfully corrected only due to the donor help of Petersburg Polytechnical Institute. Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy was formally and legally reborn in 1939 as the Higher Naval Engineering Construction School on the base of the Leningrad Industrial Construction Engineers Institute (separate part of Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University), and enlarged with the Sea Engineering Faculty of the Moscow Military Academy. Higher Naval Engineering Construction School was renamed the Higher Naval Engineering Technical School. Leonid Kantorovich became the professor of Military Engineering-Technical University, previously known as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, when it was revived on the site of part of the Polytechnical Institute. Also, the academician Boris Galerkin took a general's uniform in 1939, as the head of VITU's structural mechanics department became a lieutenant general. In September 1960, VITU university was called the Order of the Red Banner Higher Military Engineering School and became part of the construction troops. In 1974, the university was named after A.N. Komarovsky. In 1993, the university was reformed as the Military Engineering-Technical Institute, which received its present-day name in 1997, after as did merger the Pushkin Higher Military Engineering Construction School. = The Second World War= Military Engineering-Technical University directly took part in World War II. The graduating students of the university fought heroically at all fronts of that war. They showed spiritual force and quality of engineering competence. The forts and numerous fortifications buildings was established by the graduating students of university, all of it played a vital part in defending (for example Brest Fortress). So unique Krasnaya Gorka fort was constructed by the graduating students of VITU at the beginning of the 20th century with the installation of 12-inch guns in concrete casemates. The system of forts played a key part in the Siege of Leningrad. The VITU's graduating students by the commanders of Krasnaya Gorka fort did to finally stopped the offensive of fascists already in 1941. During the Siege of Leningrad, Boris Galerkin was the head of the city engineering defence department experts group. Also, he joined the military engineering commission of the Academy of Sciences. Hard non-stop work was undermining his health. Not long after the Victory, in , Galerkin died. Leonid Kantorovich was the professor of the VITU of the Navy, and there he was in charge of safety on the Road of Life; for his feat and courage he was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War.Dochenko V. D., Navy. War. Victory. St. Petersburg, Shipbuilding. 1995 All employees of the university were decorated with the medal \\"For Defense of Leningrad\\". In 1944, the university was the recipient of the Order of the Red Banner award, and VITU's cadets participated in the historic Moscow Victory Parade of 1945.  Traditions of Saint Petersburg High School of Military Engineers  Engineers Castle (southern fa√ßade) with the Monument to Peter I in the foreground, favourite place of VITU's cadets Military Engineering-Technical University prolongs, saves and develops the scientific and pedagogical traditions of Saint Petersburg High (higher learning institution) School of Military Engineers, the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and Nikolaevsky Engineering School, in the place of its own historical motherland. In present days, traditions about the unique quality of pedagogical qualification of professors and teachers are saved with punctilious care. So Leonid Artamonov, a Russian engineer, geographer and traveler, military adviser of Menelik II, was the example of tradition of university about harmonic association of spiritual force and engineering competence. The Saint Ignatius Bryanchaninov chose way of spiritual service. Dmitri Mendeleev was Professor of Chemistry at the Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University. Mendeleev got married at Nikolaev Engineering-technical University's church. So a professor Aleksey Shuliachenko, an engineer and chemist, known as the \\"grandfather of the Russian cement\\", was his student. Also, Aleksey Shuliachenko was able to become a professor for a future academician Boris Galerkin at the St. Petersburg Technological Institute. Alumni and faculty In total, the University prepared more than 45,000 military engineers.

It lies in the village of Patalenitsa, administratively part of Pazardzhik Municipality within Pazardzhik Province. The church was built in the 11th‚Äì14th century, with a possible dating to 1091 based on a stone plate inscription, the present location or even existence of which is unclear. Its frescoes, discovered in 1961 and restored in the 1970s, are a work of the 12th‚Äì13th century. Built in the vicinity of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was dug into the ground as the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so that it may be protected from desecration. It was only unearthed in the middle of the 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956. History and dating According to Bulgarian National Revival enlightener Stefan Zahariev from Pazardzhik, St Demetrius was not the first church in this location. In his description of the Pazardzhik district (kaza) published in 1870, he writes that a previously existing church in roughly the same place was dedicated to Saint Pantaleon and had given its name to the village of Patalenitsa. The Church of St Pantaleon was, according to Zahariev, previously an Ancient Greek sanctuary of Asclepius. He writes that a column from this church with an inscription dedicated to Asclepius was preserved in the newer village church. The time of the present church's construction cannot be exactly defined. Scholars such as Atanas Bozhkov are of the opinion that the Church of St Demetrius was built in the early 12th century, while Krastyo Miyatev and Neli Chaneva‚ÄìVeleva date it to the late 12th or early 13th century. One author has placed its construction in the late 13th or early 14th century and others include the 11th century among the possibilities. Some publications refer to a marble plate found in the church and bearing a Medieval Greek inscription with the following text: \\"[by] Gregory Kourkouas, pro[tospatharios] and duke of Ph[ilippopolis], indiction 14, year 6599 (= 1090/1091)\\". The plate is preserved in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia (inv. n. 253).; Nevertheless, in the late 19th century the church was known as the Holy Kutruleshtitsa (–°–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ö—É—Ç—Ä—É–ª–µ—â–∏—Ü–∞, Sveta Kutruleshtitsa) to the locals, which may indicate a connection to the name of Gregory Kourkouas from the plate. Another legend tells of the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th‚Äì15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and forgotten about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree on top of the hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. The church was listed among the architectural monuments of culture of national importance in 1956, and the subsequent discovery of its early murals led to its inclusion on the list of artistic monuments of culture in 1971. Architecture and decoration The Church of St Demetrius in Patalenitsa was built of stone, though the dome and side bays also exhibit brickwork. The church is long and wide, and is among the relatively few medieval churches of the crossed-dome type still standing in Bulgaria. It has an octagonal dome and a five-sided apse. The south facade features three bays with narrow windows attached. The church's floor was originally covered with marble, though the marble was removed in one of the possibly three rounds of reconstruction that the church underwent. For example, the present narthex was not added until the final reconstruction some time in the 19th century. Medieval frescoes used to cover the entirety of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018‚Äì1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv). Among the biblical scenes painted inside the Church of St Demetrius are the Ascension of Jesus, which adorns the altar vault, as well as the Resurrection of Lazarus and the Transfiguration of Jesus, which decorate the vault left of the apse. Images of a number of saints have also been preserved, including these of the patron saint Demetrius, Saint George riding a white horse, Saint Achillius of Larissa and Saint Nicholas.

Later that year Yoshie defeated former IWGP Heavyweight Champions Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima in singles matches. However, Yoshie's climb was cut short, when Nagata disbanded Fighting Club G-EGGS in June 2001, sending him back down the card. On June 13, 2003, Yoshie won his to date only title in NJPW, when he teamed with Hiroshi Tanahashi to defeat Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. They would hold the title for six months, before losing it to Tenzan and Osamu Nishimura. After years of being unable to break through into the main fold of NJPW, Yoshie decided not to re-sign with the promotion in January 2006 and instead became a freelancer. =Freelancer (2006‚Äìpresent)= After leaving NJPW, Yoshie made his debut for Pro Wrestling Zero1, where he, under the ring name Y2P‚Äì160 kg, formed a tag team called the P‚ÄìForce Men with Steve Corino. On February 25, 2006, Yoshie and Corino defeated Skull and Bones (Ikuto Hidaka and Minoru Fujita) to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. They would hold the title for four months, before losing it to Kohei Sato and Ryouji Sai on June 20, 2006. Yoshie spent most of the rest of 2006 working for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), where he in April participated in his first Champion Carnival. In late 2006 Yoshie also made his debut for Tatsumi Fujinami's and Osamu Nishimura's Muga World Pro Wrestling, for which he wrestled most of 2007. On December 13, 2007, Yoshie defeated Fujinami in the finals of a tournament to win Muga's Dragon Cup. On January 4, 2008, Yoshie made his return to NJPW at Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome, where he, Masato Tanaka, Tatsuhito Takaiwa and Katsushi Takemura defeated Takashi Iizuka, Koji Kanemoto, Tiger Mask and Ryusuke Taguchi in an eight-man tag team match, when Yoshie pinned Taguchi. Later that year Yoshie teamed with Manabu Nakanishi to take part in NJPW's G1 Tag League, where the team, named Big Mountain, reached the semifinals before losing to the eventual winners of the entire tournament, TenKoji (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima). On December 6, 2008, Yoshie and Nakanishi unsuccessfully challenged The Most Violent Players (Togi Makabe and Toru Yano) for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Akebono On February 6, 2010, Yoshie made his debut for Pro Wrestling Noah in a match, where he defeated Shuhei Taniguchi. In June Yoshie made another return to NJPW to compete in the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament, where, under a mask and the ring name Pink Strong Machine, he teamed with Super Strong Machine and Tonga Strong Machine. The team was eliminated in the second round by Prince Devitt, Ryusuke Taguchi and Hirooki Goto. In April 2012, Yoshie entered AJPW's 2012 Champion Carnival, however, an ankle fracture on April 23 forced him to pull out of the tournament. Yoshie returned to the ring at an AJPW event on January 20, 2013, when he teamed with Kenso to defeat Mazada and Sushi in a tag team match. The following month, Yoshie formed the Momokuro-gun tag team with Black Tiger V. On February 24, Yoshie returned to Pro Wrestling Noah, defeating Masao Inoue in a singles match. On January 26, 2014, Yoshie formed a super heavyweight tag team with Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Akebono. The team won AJPW's World Tag Team Championship on March 22, 2015, by defeating Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori. They lost the title to Go Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara on May 6. On November 23, 2017, Yoshie and Shogun Okamoto won Zero1's 2017 Furinkazan Tag Tournament, defeating Yuko Miyamoto and Yusaku Obata in the finals.

Built in Germany in 1971, it made several flights but did not enter production. Design and development One of the main reasons for the popularity of the biplane in the early days of aviation was the wing strength provided by this arrangement. The two wings, their interplane struts and flying wires form a strong, box girder-like structure. Thus cantilever biplane wings are quite rare, though they do provide extra wing area for a given span and for the easy separation of wings from each other and from the fuselage. The Lemberger LD20b was one of this kind, designed with readily detachable wings and tailplane so that it could be towed by a car. Whilst towing, the wings were stowed alongside the fuselage. The tailskid was linked to the car via a luggage rack-like frame. The upper and lower wings of the LD20b were very similar, with the same span, area and straight, near-constant chord, plan. The lower wings were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper ones to cabane struts above the front of the cabin. They were arranged with considerable stagger. The wings were built around two closely spaced spars, with plywood skin from the rear spar forward forming a torsion box and fabric covering behind. Differential ailerons were mounted only on the lower wings. The wooden, rectangular fuselage was plywood-covered to just behind the pilot's seat and fabric- covered further aft apart from a curved plywood decking behind the cabin. The fin was integral with the fuselage and unusually shallow with the variable incidence tailplane mounted on top of it, a little above the fuselage and bearing damped elevators. The balanced rudder was much taller than the fin. The enclosed cabin seated two in tandem with the front seat under the upper wing and over the centre of gravity. Dual control was fitted. In front, a Walter Mikron inverted 4-cylinder engine drove a two-bladed propeller. Operational history The LD20b was completed in 1971. Its first flights were made from EDSZ Rottweil-Zepfenhahn,(Germany), piloted by a Me 109 pilot. The next flight from Friedrichshafen, Germany, piloted by Arnold Wagner, an airline pilot, the Swiss aerobatic champion and designer of the Hirth Acrostar. After its presentation at Friedrichshafen, Leonhard Kurt Kienlein took over ownership, which he retains, and the task of making the structural changes in order to make sure the plane did reach stable flight characteristics. He also maintained the aircraft. An enclosed, all-weather trailer was built to house the LD20. The last flight after a total of 368 hours was in 1998. Later, Lemberger abandoned plans to build a high-wing monoplane of his own design after failing to find suitable construction space.

Unable to withstand not meddling, Blair follows Eva selling the watch that Chuck gave her and hatches a scheme to expose her as a gold digger. Blair tries to expose her but fails when Eva explains that she was selling the watch to pay the mortgage of Chuck's valet, displaying her altruistic personality and making Chuck have Eva decide to which charity he will donate to. Dan and Serena's conversation moves towards having fun instead of facing his loss. Blair calls on Serena's aid to uncover dirt regarding Eva's past and Serena recruits Dan to help her. Eva slowly reveals her past to Blair but finds nothing worthy of ruining her. Nate later sees that Juliet has been lying about her whereabouts and is determined to find the truth. Returning to her apartment, Dan and Serena explain that Eva was a prostitute. Blair kicks out Dan and finds Serena reluctant to see him go, not only finding dirt that she could use to ruin Eva but the revelation that Serena chose Dan when she intended to make a choice after Paris. Blair encourages Serena to attend Chuck's party and look for Dan. At the party, Blair finds out that Chuck is already aware of Eva's past and shrugs off Blair's attempt, Dan and Serena meet but are disturbed by Vanessa, who confronts Dan over his avoiding his loss over Milo and reveals that Serena was making a choice between him and Nate, and Nate confronts Juliet over her lying about her whereabouts. Chuck makes his announcement, stating that he will be setting up a new charity, one that Eva will be heading. Making a last-ditch effort to ruin Eva, Blair takes Chuck's passport from his valet in Eva's luggage to frame her for gold-digging and succeeds. Chuck asks Eva to leave but discovers from Lily that his passport was with her. Realizing his mistake, Chuck pleads with Eva to stay, even mentioning \\"everyone leaves me.\\" However, Eva, heartbroken, still leaves because, after all the love and kindness she has showed him, he still doubted her sincerity and believed Blair. When Nate turns to Serena, a jealous Dan confronts her stating that he knows about her decision between him and Nate, leaving Serena upset. Juliet then reveals that her brother is in jail and Nate gladly accepts her apology and her invitation into her apartment. The closing montage shows Dan opening his heart regarding Milo and his love for Vanessa, and Juliet paying a concierge for pretending that she owns her expensive apartment and fooling Nate. Chuck, believing that Blair wanted only to hurt him, goes to Blair's apartment and declares war on her for making Eva, the only good thing to come into his life, leave. He reveals that he's returned to his worst self and fires his valet. Blair and Serena, in the closing seconds, comfort each other.

The band, which performs a mix of punk rock and psychobilly, features Freeman on lead vocals and double bass in contrast to the backing vocals and bass guitar he typically performs in Rancid (though he still plays bass guitar on select tracks). Originally envisioned as a concept album about the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, Devils Brigade was co-written by Freeman and his longtime bandmate Tim Armstrong, who also played guitar on the album and served as record producer alongside Ryan Foltz. The album also features X drummer DJ Bonebrake and contributions from Rancid's Lars Frederiksen, and was released August 31, 2010 through Armstrong's label Hellcat Records. The album peaked at number 21 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums  Background and recording  Freeman started Devils Brigade in 2000 when he and Armstrong began writing songs together during breaks between Rancid tours. Backed by Armstrong on guitar and Rancid drummer Brett Reed, he debuted the project in 2002 with the song \\"Vampire Girl\\" on the compilation album Give 'Em the Boot III. He continued to work on Devils Brigade in between tours supporting Rancid's 2003 album Indestructible, releasing two singles in 2003 and 2005. Following tours in support of Rancid's 2009 album Let the Dominoes Fall, Freeman revived Devils Brigade to record a full-length album. It was originally envisioned as a concept album based on an idea of Armstrong's for a musical about the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, titled Half Way to Hell Club after the informal fraternity of nineteen steelworkers who were caught by safety netting strung below the construction site, saving them from what would have otherwise been fatal falls into the bay below. \\"We grew up in the East Bay looking at that bridge and it has always been a part of our lives\\", said Freeman. Armstrong co-wrote the album with Freeman, with six of the twelve tracks‚Äîincluding \\"Bridge of Gold\\" and \\"Half Way to Hell\\"‚Äîoriginating from the Golden Gate Bridge concept while the remaining six‚Äîincluding \\"Ride Harley\\" and \\"Vampire Girl\\"‚Äîwere new recordings of tracks from the first Devils Brigade demo. Devils Brigade was recorded in early 2010 at Sunset Lodge in Hollywood and Cleveland Audio in Cleveland, with additional recording conducted at Rancid's Bloodclot studio. It was produced by Armstrong, who also played guitar on the album and sang lead vocals on \\"Gentleman of the Road\\", and by Ryan Foltz who also played mandolin. Drums were played by DJ Bonebrake of X and The Knitters, who had previously played with Freeman in Auntie Christ. \\"It was a great vibe in the studio,\\" said Freeman, \\"The record has a real live and loose vibe. Loose in a good way. Tim's guitar style blended really well with DJ and everything clicked very quickly.\\" Lars Frederiksen of Rancid also contributed to two tracks: \\"Darlene\\", which he co-wrote, and \\"Bridge of Gold\\", on which he, Armstrong, and Freeman took turns singing the verses. Devils Brigade was released August 31, 2010 through Armstrong's Hellcat Records label. The band supported the album with a tour of the United States opening for Street Dogs through October 2010. The faster, original version of Darlene was originally recorded for Rancid's Let The Dominoes Fall. You can hear part of the track during the documentary on the making of the record.  Reception  Critics' reviews of Devils Brigade have generally praised its mix of musical styles while criticizing its working-class lyrical themes. Jason Lymangrover of Allmusic noted Freeman's \\"gruff Gene Simmons-esque growl\\", the surf rock influences on \\"Ride Harley\\", and the bluegrass approach to \\"Bridge of Gold\\". He concluded that the album was \\"a far cry from the straightforward modern-day punk of Rancid, but open-minded fans of the band may find the tumbleweed twist from the norm enticing.\\" Chris Parker of Alternative Press remarked that Freeman \\"sounds refreshed by the change of scenery\\", and that though the album at times borders on Rancid's punk rock sound, \\"Freeman takes advantage of the novelty to explore new territory, from rambunctious barrelhouse folk-punk ('Bridge of Gold') to throttling psychobilly ('Vampire Girl'), jazzy folk- swing ('Gentleman of the Road'), infectious old-school rock rave-ups ('Protest Song'), and reverb-drenched numbers biting Ennio Morricone ('Ride Harley'). While Freeman's gruff vocal delivery is still very punk rock, the overwhelming success of these dozen tracks is due to the effortless eclecticism of their gritty underclass portraits.\\" Criticism of the album has focused primarily on its lyrics. Joe Pelone of Punknews.org complained that the themes of working- class problems and motorcycles were very niche and had replaced the band's earlier, more kitschy material; he cited \\"Vampire Girl\\" as one of the band's best tracks while remarking that \\"sadly, the other songs aren't as gleefully macabre\\". He described the album's lyrics as being \\"pretty in keeping with the late-period Rancid of Let the Dominoes Fall, just with fewer references to being from the East Bay or whatever and more instances of roots rock\\", and complained that \\"some of the songs are pretty terrible‚Äî'Protest Song' is got- damn cheesy with its celebration of 'the working man / the blue collar man / he‚Äôs a fighting man'; the lyrics are wanting.\\" He noted, however, that \\"the music still serves up delicious slices of psychobilly\\" and that \\"this record sounds like a group of friends having fun.\\" Adam Steel of Eye Weekly gave Devils Brigade a negative review, saying that \\"Guitarist Armstrong, who seems to join and/or invent a new group every year, is just as disappointing in Brigade as his venture into Crazy Town‚Äìterritory with the Transplants\\". He criticized the album's \\"lack of consistency and overly complicated sounds\\" as well as Freeman's singing, remarking that \\"The disc never strays far from loud, crunchy guitars, but the vocals are too similar to that signature Rancid yell-scream delivery, sounding comical on tracks that feature banjo and upright bass\\".

Built 1983 by Mitsui Co. in Ichihara, Chiba, Japan and christened MV Sono, she sailed as a dry cargo ship under various names and flags until in 2010 she was converted into a Powership at the Sedef Shipyard in Tuzla, Turkey. She supplied electricity to the power grid in south-eastern Iraq. Currently, she supplies electricity to Sierra Leone. Cargo ship The ship was built in 1983 (according to some sources in 1984) as a bulk carrier with deck mounted cranes by the Japanese shipyard Mitsui Co in Ichihara, Chiba with yard number 1264 and was named Sono. The long vessel has a beam of and a draft of . By 41,525 DWT, she has a cargo capacity of . The ship is propelled by a single screw, which is powered by a 13,100 HP MAN B&W; Diesel engine. Misr Shipping Co. in Egypt purchased and renamed her Saqqara. Later, she was bought by Bright Star Marine in Malta and was renamed Seapace. The Greek company Thenamaris Ships Man. operated the cargo ship under the flag of Malta. Her next owner became another Greek maritime company, Vulcanus Technical Maritime Enterprises S.A., which renamed her to Melpomeni. =Sister ships= *Seaboxer II, Malta (ex-Aton) (IMO 8117029) *Radonezh, Liberia (ex-Abydos) (IMO 8117017) *Searider, Malta (ex- Thebes) (IMO 8204286) Powership The freighter Melpomeni was finally acquired in 2009 by Karpowership, a subsidiary of Karadeniz Holding, with the purpose to turn her into a floating power plant sailing under the Liberian flag. She was renamed Karadeniz Powership Doƒüan Bey after Nuri Doƒüan Karadeniz, the COO of the parent company. The Sedef Shipyard in Tuzla, Istanbul was commissioned by May 2009 with the task to convert the cargo ship into a Powership by installing the needed engine-generators, transformers and the electric switchboards on board. Doƒüan Bey is the first of its kind, a Powership with dual-fuel diesel engines installed on board. Aboard the vessel, twelve generator units are installed having 10.53 MW each. Three units are packed in one of the ship's four holds and fans and funnels mounted on deck. Bureau Veritas, an international certification agency with experience in overseeing both shipbuilding and power plant development, classified the vessel following its conversion as \\"special service-floating power plant\\". On April 3, 2010, the floating power plant was ready to go to its first mission in Iraq. After a sending-off ceremony held at the Sedef Shipyard in presence of the Turkish and Iraqi ministers of energy, she sailed to Basra, arriving there on May 1. Doƒüan Bey was moored at Berth #9 of Umm Qasr Port, south- eastern Iraq, at the country's hub of imports and exports. The power plant on the ship's deck generates electricity using a refined fuel provided by the Iraqi Department of Energy and runs it to the national power grid. It is reported that the Powership has the ability to supply Umm Qasr with all the electric energy required and some left over. The power plant on the ship is operated and maintained by Turkish personnel while for the security of the facility, around 70 local guards are hired. Doƒüan Bey provided electricity in Iraq for the next five years following a contract signed with the local Department of Energy. In January 2018, Karpowership signed a contract with Sierra Leone's national utility company, Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA) to supply 30 MW of power to Freetown for a duration of 5 years. Doƒüan Bey is currently in Sierra Leone.

In addition to providing educational and rehabilitative services, CSC also offers social and recreational activities for its clients, hosts camping sessions at its summer camp Highbrook Lodge, and has a Low vision Clinic. More than 100 specially trained staff members, including social workers, optometrists, certified vision rehabilitation therapists, orientation and mobility instructors, occupational therapists, educators, nurses, and other professionals work to help individuals with vision loss to live and work independently. Although unique services are available for each age group, many activities, especially social and recreational activities, overlap. History The Cleveland Sight Center was founded in 1906 under the name Cleveland Society for the Blind, inspired by an 1898 project at Goodrich House which, among other things, encouraged enrollment of blind and visually impaired individuals in the Cleveland Public School System. In early 1906, with support from the Cleveland Public Library system, Visiting Nursing Association, related charities, area settlement houses, and the American Foundation for the Blind under Robert B. Irwin, the Society for the Blind was established. In 1989 it was renamed as Cleveland Sight Center of the Cleveland Society for the Blind Leadership In April, 2015, Cuyahoga County Development Director, Larry Benders, became the tenth President and Executive Director of the Cleveland Sight Center. Benders had served as the director of the Cuyahoga County Workforce Investment Board. He had also served as the Director of Marketing for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. = Available technologies = CSC's STORER Center offers a wide variety of technologies and training to its clients, including computers, CCTVs, voice control (Dragon & J-Say), software magnification (ZoomText & MAGic), screen reader (JAWS, Window Eyes, System Access), optical character recognition (Kurzweil, OpenBook, and OmniPage), Braille translation (Duxbury), digital recorders, and digital book players, Braille embossers, refreshable Braille displays, note takers (PacMate, BrailleNote, and Braille+), and Microsoft Office products (Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Access) Working in partnership with University Hospitals' Eye Institute's Center for Retina and Macular Disease and its director, Suber Huang, MD, the Cleveland Sight Center will help treat patients who receive the first FDA approved retina implant, the Argus II. The implant works like a wireless device to transmit images through glasses to the implant, actually allowing patients to see. The Argus II is only effective with the nearly 100,000 people in the US suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease. Ann Arbor, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Durham, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia and San Francisco are also US cities approved for the device. = Organizational affiliates = * CSC is Ohio's distributor for Freedom Scientific * CSC's senior assistive technology practitioner is a member of RESNA * the STORER Center's manager is a member of North East Ohio Usability Professional Association  Orientation & mobility  Cleveland Sight Center's PREP program evaluates the extent of a client's needs for effective independent travel, creating a personalized orientation and mobility training plan catered to the individual's specific needs and age group.  Employment services  Cleveland Sight Center's Williams Career Development Department helps adults who are blind or visually impaired seeking career opportunities. Working in conjunction with the STORER Center and PREP, Employment Services informs clients and employers of the accommodations available to help the blind and visually impaired utilize their abilities and talents to their fullest capacity in the workplace. After determining what career interests clients have and/or are best suited for via its comprehensive vocational evaluation system, staff provide clients with training in various areas of job readiness, from learning to fill out applications and develop their resumes to practicing job interviews and learning about employer expectations. Through networking and partnerships with various organizations in northeast Ohio, including Progressive Field, the Great Lakes Science Center, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, employment services helps connect clients with employers and secure work. Once a client finds permanent work, he/she is monitored for 90 days during which employment services determines what accommodations the client needs to perform at optimal efficiency. The agency received a contract from Tourism Ohio, the state agency charged with promoting tourism to the Buckeye State. The Cleveland Sight Center runs the state's 1-800-BUCKEYE phone service. Those who call the tourism number are connected with an operator at the agency's call center, where the caller can get information and literature on visiting Ohio. In January, 2016, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted contracted with the Sight Center to provide call center services for callers looking for information on business services. The contract, which Husted said was for quality purposes, was for approximately $500,000. 95% of callers surveyed in the first month of the service reported a satisfactory service. Beginning in 2009, CSC began an 8-week program training working-aged clients to work in call center or customer service positions.  Business Enterprises Training  This program provides training to clients as potential food service managers in any of 100 facilities (e.g. cafeterias, snack bars, dry stands or vending machine locations) on Federal and State properties in Ohio, eleven of which are located around the Greater Cleveland Area. To qualify, a client must be at least 21 years old, have good interpersonal, math, and mobility skills, have a high school diploma or G.E.D., and undergo a two-week pre-training in-stand evaluation. By the end of August, 2012, the Cleveland Sight Center closed its nine remaining food stands, citing financial losses. The food stand program, which began in 1922, employed ten visually impaired people. The program had contracted significantly since 2000, when there were 18 food stands in the Cleveland area. The Sight Center has committed to finding replacement employment for all affected individuals.  Early intervention  Cleveland Sight Center's Bright Futures Early Intervention program works with children from birth to 3 years old and their families to help them overcome or minimize developmental delays, including adjusting to vision loss. The program staff includes an early interventionist, occupational therapist, physical therapist and a speech and language therapist who conduct assessments and activities, host weekly support groups, and provide encouragement and information for each family through these most crucial first three years of the client's life.  Preschool  Cleveland Sight Center's Bright Futures Preschool‚Äîa part of the Sight Center's Early Intervention program‚Äîis a program for 3- to 5-year-old children who have disabilities, including visual impairments. Children without any disabilities are also welcome. Students each receive assessments conducted by the Early Intervention staff, resulting in the creation of personalized lesson plans for them in typical areas of importance for developing children. The students participate in the program four times a week. Just like its other departments, CSC's preschool program works with other organizations and individuals to make the world more accessible for its young clients, such as its work with the local Girl Scouts to create tactile versions of Eric Carle books.  Highbrook Lodge Camp  Highbrook Lodge is Cleveland Sight Center's ACA Accredited summer camp spanning over 60 acres in Geauga County.

Attendees are then welcome to travel around the Crocker Park or Legacy Village areas with a white cane, utilizing their normal vision, wearing a pair of goggles that mimic the limiting effects caused by various eye diseases, or even sporting a blindfold if they so desire. CSC's 4th Annual White Cane Walk, held on 05/30/2010, had more than 400 people in attendance, including WDOK's on-air personality \\"Trapper Jack\\" who spoke of his own struggles with vision loss leading to eventual blindness and relationship with the Cleveland Sight Center. =EnVision Independence Vision Rehabilitation Program= Cleveland Sight Center normally provides rehabilitative services to clients at its University Circle location as well as through in-home sessions. However, since the inception of this new community-based rehabilitation and technology training program in October 2007, CSC has been able to provide the same services in Westerly Apartments & Barton Senior Center in Lakewood and Villa Serena in Mayfield Heights utilizing a class-like setting that mimics in-home training sessions. Each EnVision Independence session lasts seven weeks, during which trained and licensed social workers and rehabilitation professionals, many of whom are blind or visually impaired themselves, teach daily living skills complemented by assistive technology training. \\"The change in a client's confidence and outlook on life once they have completed their vision rehabilitation is remarkable,\\" says Peggy Keating, Director of Senior and Outreach Services at Cleveland Sight Center. \\"We hope to continue to expand this program to other communities throughout Northeast Ohio.\\" =Skipper's Invitational Sailing Excursion= Cleveland Sight Center's Blind and Visually Impaired Sailing Program, made possible in 1995 thanks to a grant from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Watercraft, aims to train persons with varying degrees of vision loss to navigate and pilot a nautical vessel. The program places great emphasis on teamwork, communication skills, and safety. Two teams were selected to sail to Fairport Harbor from the East 55th Street Marina on a Friday on two of CSC's donated boats, with two separate teams selected to make the return trip the following morning. Participants were chosen for this special excursion, expected to last between 4‚Äì5 hours, based on their skill level. Although the trip started off well, the boats eventually encountered strong headwinds and 8‚Äì10 foot waves which hindered any progress they could make as the crews estimated a remaining 7‚Äì8 hours between them and their destination. As a result, the teams headed back to Cleveland, arriving successfully after maneuvering through intense waves and less-than-ideal conditions. Despite not completing the challenge, it was evident that the crews still felt successful for achieving as much as they did, difficult seafaring conditions notwithstanding. =Fundamentals for success= Fundamentals for Success is a six-week program offered annually from June to July. It focuses on providing training for college or vocational training for CSC clients aged 16‚Äì22. CSC houses them in a residential apartment and provides them with various training and rehabilitative services. Services include independent living, survival skills, orientation and mobility, technology, financial aid/scholarship counseling, and developing recreational and social skills.

Roswell King owned slaves, many of whom helped to build his home and the original mill; however, the number of slaves his family owned decreased once the mill was operating. Barrington King and Ralph King, two of Roswell‚Äôs sons, moved to the area to help run the fledgling business.

The first building was four stories high, eighty-eight feet long and forty-eight feet wide, though it was later expanded to 140 by fifty-three feet. The Roswell Mill was incorporated in 1839 by the Georgia General Assembly. The King family built two buildings, known as The Bricks, in which mill employees lived.Web. 10 Oct. 2010.

Civil War Era The Roswell Mills are best known for their role in producing supplies for the Confederacy during the Civil War. They made \\"Roswell Gray\\" fabric to be sewed into Confederate military uniforms. Because it was of great importance to the South‚Äôs military supply chain, General Gerrard, a Union official working under the purview of General Sherman, seized the mill on July 5, 1864.\\"History of the Roswell Mill Workers.\\" Roswell Mills SCV Camp #1547.

The reference to the foreigners were made because the mill owners, apparently in a ploy to safeguard the mills, planted a French flag on the mills and put a French millhand in charge. =Deportation of workers= The taking of the mill was not just a capture of infrastructure. The Union troops took about 400 mill workers, most of them women and children, to Marietta to be sent North on trains.\\"Deportation of Roswell Mill Women.\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia.

During the week while the women were held in Marietta, several Union soldiers allegedly committed acts of assault against their captives. They were then left to fend for themselves in Indiana, in towns already overcrowded with refugees. Many would die from starvation or exposure until a mill opened in 1865 that provided employment.

Postbellum developments Known as Roswell Mill No. 2 when built in 1882, this structure is an adaptive reuse from former textile mill to current use as office space. After the war one of the cotton mills and the woolen factory were rebuilt. In 1882 a second cotton mill was built.Roswell Mill During the Reconstruction period and the beginning of the 20th century, the Roswell Manufacturing Company underwent several important changes. In 1897, the mills began using steam power, which improved productivity but kept the mill dependent on Vickery Creek. Easley Cotton Mills, a South Carolina company, bought the mill complex for $800,000 in 1920.\\"Roswell Mills Bring $800,000.\\" Atlanta Constitution 21 Feb. 1920: 9. Print.< At that time, the mill had 120 looms and 12,000 spindles. This infrastructure is a testament to the mill's large production capacity and value to the city of Roswell. The fact that the mill changed ownership frequently suggests its declining value in the increasingly competitive 20th-century market. In 1926, the mill was set on fire by a lightning strike, which caused about $400,000 in damage.\\"$400,000 Blaze Guts Historic Roswell Mill.\\" Atlanta Constitution 13 June 1926: 1. Print. The company was purchased by Southern Mills in 1947. In 1975, the mill halted operations as a result of outsourcing cotton production overseas. The mill's recent past is far less recorded in history than its pre-1950 history. There is no readily available record of the impact of the mill's closure on the surrounding area. It seems that the mill lost much of its money-making power when the age of King Cotton had passed. Current status The historic Roswell Mills are now under the jurisdiction of the U.S. National Park Service.\\"Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service).\\" Experience Your America. U.S. National Park Service. Web. 16 Sept. 2010. The mills are considered part of the Chattahoochee River Recreation Area, a popular local tourist attraction due to its nature trails, running paths, and rich history. Remnants of various buildings are still visible, and the covered bridge spanning Vickery Creek has been rebuilt. A private contractor was scheduled to clear away the effects of the elements from the mill site in the summer of 2008.\\"Roswell's History to Come Out from Underbrush.\\" Atlanta Journal Constitution. 27 May 2008.

It lies southwest of Pazardzhik, at the northern foot of the Karkaria ridge of the western Rhodope Mountains, some above sea level. In 1955, the nearby village of Batkun was merged to Patalenitsa. There are several ancient and medieval sights in and around Patalenitsa. These include the 11th‚Äì14th century crossed-dome Church of St Demetrius with its preserved frescoes, the Batkun Monastery, which was founded in the Middle Ages and last reestablished in the 19th century, the ruins of the medieval Batkun Fortress (Batkounion), and the ruins of an ancient sanctuary of Asclepius dating to the 1st‚Äì4th century. Besides the medieval but inactive St Demetrius, there are two other Bulgarian Orthodox churches in Patalenitsa. The Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God was built in 1708, while the Church of the Holy Mother of God in the Batkun neighbourhood is newer and dates to 1892. In addition, there is a new chapel dedicated to Saint George, which was constructed in 2002 at the place of an older one. There are several theories explaining the etymology of the village's name. According to one theory, it is tied to the name of Saint Pantaleon, a church dedicated to whom occupied the present site of the village's Church of St Demetrius. A second explanation derives the name from the village of Patele in Aegean Macedonia (today Agios Panteleimonas, Florina regional unit, Greece), from which people settled in Patalenitsa in the 18th century. Another possibility is a link to the Bulgarian word pat (–ø—ä—Ç, \\"road\\"), due to Patalenitsa's position on a crossroad. The village has its own village hall, the present building of which dates to 1970, a cultural centre (chitalishte) established in 1909, and a monument to the locals who perished as Bulgarian Army soldiers in the Balkan Wars and World War I. The earliest school in Patalenitsa was founded in 1865, though the current edifice of the village school was constructed in 1923.

With over twenty years of experience, and twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (2000 and 2001), KHRG is recognised internationally as an authority on major issues such as internal displacement, forced labour, landmines, conflict and land confiscation in southeast Burma/Myanmar. KHRG works directly with \\"rural villagers who are suffering abuses such as forced labor, systematic destruction of villagers and crops, forced relocations, extortion, looting, arbitrary detention, torture, sexual assault and summary executions.\\" Most of these abuses were committed by soldiers and officials of the State Peace & Development Council (SPDC), Burma's previous ruling military junta. The organisation's goal is to support villagers in rural Burma, by helping them develop strategies to resist abuse and by translating their testimonies for worldwide distribution, accompanied by supporting photos and documentary evidence. Most recently, KHRG was awarded the Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award in 2013, and KHRG staffers have been chosen to represent national civil society organisations in discussing land rights with the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission and the Myanmar Peace Center, and to testify before the United Nations Security Council about child soldiers. History = Karen people = The Karen are a group of Indo- Chinese tribes living principally in Burma in the Indo-Chinese Peninsula. The greater part of this territory they occupy in connection with the other peoples of the country, namely, the Burmese, Shan, Siamese, and Chin. The only exclusively Karen country is the hilly region of the Toungoo district and the Karenni subdivision.\\"The Karen People of Burma: A Study in Anthropology and Ethnology\\". (1922) The Karen languages, members of the Tibeto-Burman group of the Sino-Tibetan language family, consist of three mutually unintelligible branches: Sgaw, Pwo, and Pa'o.[20] [21] Karenni (Red Karen) and Kayan belong to the Sgaw branch. Karens were Animists originally, but today the majority is Buddhist in conjunction with Animism. The Buddhist influence came from the Mon who were dominant in Lower Burma until the middle of the 18th century. Tha Byu, the first convert to Christianity in 1828. Persecution of Christians by the Burmese authorities has continued to this day, fuelled by the belief that Western imperialists have sought to divide the country not only on ethnic but on religious grounds. = Background on Burma = Burma is a country of ethnic diversity, its estimated population of 48‚Äì50 million being divided between 15 major ethnic groups, many of them with distinct subgroups. These groups come from very different origins. The extent of differences is visible in their cultures and languages. According to the Karen, their people \\"arrived in Burma, a region at the time was virtually unpopulated jungle, approximately 2,500 years ago after a migration in several stages from the region of what is now Mongolia, and settled in what is now the Irrawaddy and Sittaung basin of central Burma.\\" This began the movement of peoples like the Karen from the central lowlands out into the hills. The British took over what is now Burma in 3 wars: 1824‚Äì26, 1852‚Äì53, and finally in 1886, when ‚ÄòBurma‚Äô became part of the British Empire as a province of British India. Burma gained its independence in 1948. \\"The military has dominated government since General Ne Win led a coup in 1962 that toppled the civilian government of U Nu. Burma remains under the tight control of the military-led State Peace and Development Council.\\" = Karen‚Äôs issues with the Burmese government = Burma is home to one of the longest running civil wars in the world. Over the last 50 years, opposition organisations representing a variety of political agendas have taken up arms against the central government in Rangoon. Since 1962, the country has been run by a succession of military governments, including the current ruling junta, the SPDC. The primary victims in Burma's protracted civil war have been ethnic minority people, like the Karen, Mon and Karenni.Bowles, \\"From village to camp: refugee camp life in transition on the Thailand-Burma Border\\". (1998) Under the rule of the SPDC, farming villages have to deal with several Army battalions moving into the area, restricting the movements of villagers and demanding food, labour, and building materials. Karen families operate on a subsistence level, growing enough rice and vegetables for their own use. Their system has no safety net in hard times, therefore there is no built-in capacity to deal with this situation. Their forced relocation under the SPDC military is for the purpose of using them as a convenient source of unpaid labour at local Army camps and along the roads. After a few months, many people find they have little option but to starve or flee. The Burmese army carries out massive forced relocation of rural villages, with the intention of eliminating civilian support for opposition groups or clearing ground for infrastructural projects. These days most people know what is happening at the relocation sites, so when they are ordered to move they simply flee into hiding in the forests surrounding their farmlands. Tens of thousands of people are presently living in this way \\"under the constant risk of being captured or shot by passing SPDC patrols who also seek out and destroy their food supplies and crops in the fields. Eventually, they can no longer survive this way and try to make their way to the border [between Burma and] Thailand to become refugees.\\"  KHRG‚Äôs Vision and Mission  The Karen Human Rights Group envisions a future in which people in Burma achieve full human rights and justice. To this end, the KHRG seeks to further develop as an independent, credible and Karen-led organisation working in close co-operation with local communities and operating with a perspective on human rights as articulated by villagers themselves. KHRG is an independent local organisation committed to improving the human rights situation in Burma by projecting the voices of villagers and supporting their strategies to claim human rights. KHRG aims to increase villagers‚Äô capability and opportunity to claim their human rights, and ensure that their voices, priorities and perspectives influence decision makers. They encourage other local and international groups and institutions to support villagers‚Äô self-protection strategies.  Karen camps and locations  Mae Sot, Thai‚ÄìBurmese border. Many Karen refugee camps are located along this border. The first Karen camp was established in 1984, not far from the border town of Mae Sot in Thailand's Tak Province. By 1986, there were 12 Karen refugee camps with a collective population of 19,000 people in Tak and Mae Hong Son provinces. The border between Thailand and Burma is over 2,000 km long, with thousands of potential crossing points. The link attached illustrates the Karen districts and the locations of various refugee camps along the border of the two states. New camps have often been established close to wherever large groups of new refugees crossed, frequently in the wake of military offensives. Individual families and smaller groups arriving in Thailand separately have gone to established camps. While some camps are located on main roads and near Thai villages, many are in remote areas. The terrain along the border is mountainous and heavily forested in places.  Documentaries on the Karen people  Human Rights in Burma is a documentary created by Burma Issues Organization. Another documentary, Prayer of Peace: Relief and Resistance in Burma‚Äôs War Zones, is a short documentary created by Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a multi-ethnic humanitarian service movement that brings help, hope and love to people in the war zones of Burma. A short extract from the film: > People know me as Monkey. In the Free Burma Rangers, I am a team pastor. And > another role is video cameraman. I started this work in 1998. At that time > the Burma Army came and the villagers fled into the jungle. As they fled I > took photos with a still camera. When people looked at the photos I would > explain to them. I wanted the photos to open their hearts. I tried but the > photos were not enough. I though if had a video camera it would be better. > Instead of me speaking for them they speak for themselves and people would > be moved. So I wanted to do video. In 2015, KHRG published a documentary on land confiscation in rural southeast Burma/Myanmar entitled 'With only our voices, what can we do?'  KHRG's position and roles within global perspectives  Scholar Kevin Malseed in Where There Is No Movement: Local Resistance and the Potential for Solidarity argues that even though \\"in Burma, any attempt to form independent agrarian movements is violently suppressed, rural Karen villagers have developed and practice complex forms of resistance involving inter-community action and solidarity across wide regions.\\"Malseed.(2008). \\"Where There Is No Movement: Local resistance and the potential for solidarity\\" These movements have been successful in \\"weakening state control over land and livelihoods largely because their lack of formal organization makes them difficult to target\\". Ingrid Brees in Refugees and transnationalism on the Thai‚ÄìBurmese border examines the role of the KHRG on the Burmese-Thai border. She argues that even though \\"the past decade has seen the rapid development of transnationalism research, transnationalism from below in situations of mass refugee influx has received little attention. However, the case study of Burmese refugees in Thailand clearly demonstrates that those refugees can maintain economic, social, cultural and political links with co-nationals in all the domains of the refugee diaspora, even if their capabilities are in principle strained.\\"Brees.(2010). Refugees and Transnationalism on the Thai‚ÄìBurmese Border It is believed that these organisations play a fundamental role in aiding refugees and helping them sustain their socio-political legitimacy.

It opened in 1905 as the Seelbach Hotel, envisioned by the Seelbach Brothers to embody the old- world grandeur of European hotels in cities such as Vienna and Paris. To do so in early 20th century Louisville, they employed a French Renaissance design in constructing the hotel.. Louis was already a restaurant owner in Louisville when his brother Otto joined him from Germany around 1890, forming the Seelbach Hotel Co.. The company began construction on the hotel in 1903. The hotel was quickly regarded among the finest hotels in the United States and throughout its long history has been frequented by many notable Americans‚Äîfor instance F. Scott Fitzgerald, who took inspiration from the Seelbach for a hotel in The Great Gatsby. The hotel is part of the Hilton Hotels & Resorts chain. History =1869‚Äì1924= Louis Seelbach and his brother Otto emigrated from Frankenthal, Germany, a small, rural town in Bavaria. Louis Seelbach arrived in Louisville in 1869 at age 17, shortly after reaching the United States. He worked in the first Galt House for a time upon his arrival, but after turning 22 in 1874, he realized that he had greater ambitions. He opened the Seelbach Bar & Grill that same year, and quickly built it into a flourishing enterprise. The success of the restaurant in Louisville's quickly expanding population and economy allowed Louis Seelbach to bring his brother Otto from Germany to help open the first Seelbach Hotel in 1891 above the bar & grill on 6th and Main.. A photo of the Seelbach Hotel and the surrounding neighborhood in 1910 The brothers were intent on building Louisville's first grand hotel: a hotel reflecting the opulence of European hotels. They purchased a piece of property at the corner of 4th and Walnut (now Muhammad Ali Blvd) Streets, broke ground in December 1903, and opened the doors on May 1, 1905, just in time for the Kentucky Derby.. On the opening day, over 25,000 people visited the hotel. The Seelbach hosted a gala that evening, with dinner parties in each of the 150 rooms.. The structure incorporated marble from Italy, Germany and France, along with wood from the West Indies and Europe.. The hotel attracted large numbers of patrons in its first two years, and, luckily, the Seelbach Realty Company‚Äîformed in 1902 before the property purchase‚Äîhad been planning from opening day to expand the hotel. On January 1, 1907, the second phase opened, raising the number of rooms to 500. The lower two floors of the ten-story structure were faced with stone, while the upper floors were brick. Work included enclosing the rooftop garden to allow it to be used as a winter garden.. This new and improved Seelbach regularly hosted guests of the Kentucky Derby. =1925‚Äì2009= In 1925, Louis, president of the Seelbach Hotel Co., died, creating a need for new management. On April 1, 1926, Chicago-based businessman Abraham M. Liebling bought the hotel for approximately $2.5 million.. In 1929, he sold the hotel to the Eppley Hotel Company for $2 million.. Mr. Eppley, of Omaha, Nebraska, owned many hotels throughout the Midwest, but eventually sold The Seelbach Hotel and all his other properties in 1956 to Sheraton as part of a $30 million deal. This made the Seelbach part of the second largest hotel sale in all of US history. The hotel became the Sheraton-Seelbach Hotel, but its name was soon shortened to just the Sheraton Hotel. Sheraton sold the hotel, along with seventeen other aging properties, to Gotham Hotels in 1968 and it regained its original name. Following a severe national economic slump in 1975, it closed after the owners went bankrupt. 4th St, one of the crossroads that The Seelbach sits on, in 1910 In 1978, Louisville native and Hollywood television actor, Roger Davis, bought the Seelbach. Restoration work began in early 1979 and continued until the grand re-opening on April 12, 1982.. National Hotels Corporation, a subsidiary of Radisson Hotels and DoubleTree Hotels managed of the property which had regained much of its former reputation.. The hotel has changed hands a number of times after its re-awakening. When MeriStar Hospitality Corp bought the hotel in 1998 and it became The Seelbach Hilton. The Seelbach was, by 2009, jointly owned by Interstate Hotels & Resorts and Investcorp and operating under the Hilton flag. In 2009, the hotel finished a renovation at a cost of $12 million. =Impact on Louisville= At the time of construction, little else existed in the area around 4th and Walnut Streets. When the Seelbach brothers proposed their project, the Mayor of Louisville said, \\"No one will come to a hotel so far away.\\" Several others attempted to discourage building on property so far from the 'center' of Louisville. Since then, Louisville has expanded and the Seelbach Hotel has long been astride one of the city's booming shopping and business districts. Between the 1930s and 1960s, the Seelbach Hotel even anchored an area with Louisville's \\"best shops\\".. Although it fell into disrepair for a period, today the area is again a bustling cultural and commercial center. The area surrounding the hotel is also filled with other large hotels in competition for the Louisville area guests. Not only has the city grown around the hotel, but more hotel owners were inspired to build in the same area after seeing the Seelbach's success. Notable guests Al Capone, a frequent Seelbach guest =Presidents= Many US Presidents have chosen to spend time at the hotel while in Louisville, including William Howard Taft (1911), Woodrow Wilson (1916), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1938), Harry Truman (1948), John F. Kennedy (1962), Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), Jimmy Carter (1970s), Bill Clinton (1998), and George W. Bush (2002).. =Gangsters= Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz, and Al Capone‚Äîwho was a frequent guest of the Seelbach‚Äîstayed at the hotel, often for clandestine poker games. One story from the 1920s involves Al Capone sneaking out through a series of secret stairways and tunnels when Louisville Police broke up one of these games.. Hotel staff are frequently eager to show the Al Capone room (if it is unoccupied) and give its history. =Others= The Rolling Stones, Whitney Houston, Elvis Presley, Billy Joel, Robin Williams, Russell Crowe, Julia Child, Wolfgang Puck, and Shorty Rossi, reality TV personality of Pit Boss are among those celebrities who have stayed at the Seelbach.. F. Scott Fitzgerald frequented the hotel in April 1918, while training for his deployment in World War I. One night after expensive bourbon and cigars however, he had to be restrained and was ejected from the hotel.. This experience seemingly did not tarnish his memories however, as he later included a fictional hotel akin to the Seelbach as the setting for the wedding of Tom and Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby.. In this story it is referenced that Tom \\"Rented out an entire floor of the Mulbach hotel\\" which could either refer to the Grand Ballroom (once located on the roof of the hotel) or the Rathskeller room (located in the basement) where Fitzgerald often went to the bar. Hotel The Seelbach undergoing restoration work in 1979 The hotel appears on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered \\"Louisville's Historic Hotel\\". =Amenities= The Seelbach offers its guests in Louisville access its restaurant The Oakroom, fitness center, and valet parking, among other standard features of a luxury hotel. =Restaurants= Restaurants in the Seelbach include The Oakroom, Gatsby's on Fourth, and Starbucks. The Oakroom is Kentucky's only AAA Five Diamond Restaurant Award winner, one of 44 in the nation while the Rathskellar, decorated with Rookwood Pottery, was a rare and distinctively Seelbach south-German influenced restaurant. Today the Rathskeller is used for occasional private events. Coming from German, the term \\"Rathskeller\\", means \\"council's cellar\\" and is a common name in German-speaking countries that refers to a bar or restaurant located in the basement of a city hall (Rathaus). The word \\"Rath\\" has nothing to do with the German word \\"Ratten\\" (rats) as has been mistakenly reported in some instances. There is a cocktail named after The Seelbach Hotel, called The Seelbach, which contains bourbon, triple sec, two kinds of bitters and topped with a brut sparkling wine or champagne. =In film= The Seelbach Hotel was featured in the 1999 Russell Crowe/Al Pacino film The Insider. The hotel has also been featured in The Hustler and The Great Gatsby (2013).

Focused on being \\"technically ambitious and socially engaged,\\" it is dedicated to producing new works that have an aspect of social awareness and using the theatre process to allow students to learn about theatre. The group takes its name from its history of having no permanent theatre to work in. The group produces three main stage shows a year, usually performed in the Walsh Black Box (no longer in use), the Village C Theatre, or the Devine Theatre in the Davis Performing Arts Center in the center of Georgetown's campus. Main stage shows are directed, produced, acted, designed largely by students. Often students in large roles such as director, producer, or designer, will have an assistant who they train to be able to perform that role on a future show. The group also produces \\"Square Pegs\\", opportunities for students to get involved in theatre without a large time commitment. These have a much shorter rehearsal process and have minimal technical elements and are often performed in the open air amphitheatre in Red Square or in Bulldog Alley in the Leavey Center. History Nomadic was created in 1982 under the name \\"D&B; Productions\\" by a group of members from the Mask & Bauble Dramatic Society (M&B;) who were tired of the Shakespeare and traditional theatre that M&B; was known for. Their first show was Harvey, about a man who befriends an imaginary giant rabbit. The group's second production, \\"The Fantasticks\\", shifted its early focus to musical theater. The name \\"Nomadic Theatre\\" was not used by the group until the spring, 1984 show, \\"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris\\", and was adopted because of the administration's unwillingness to allow the group to reserve facilities for fixed rehearsal locations, thus necessitating cast members for any given show to memorize the \\"standard progression\\" of locations where rehearsal space would be sought, and walk from one to the next until the evening's location was found. All of the group's belongings, consisting mostly of costume pieces, a few props, and a complete tool set purchased through the Roy Rogers restaurant points collection game, were kept in a closet illegally occupied by it in the basement of Xavier Hall. During the early years of the group, it produced a series of musical productions (Jacques Brel..., the Jones and Schmidt musical Philemon, A Night in the Ukraine, Sweeney Todd, What's a Nice Country Like You Doing in a State Like This? and Evita) before changing to a non-musical focus.Previous Seasons archive, Nomadic Theatre, retrieved August 21, 2019. In 2005 a new building, the Davis Performing Arts Center (DPAC), was constructed. Nomadic and other theatre groups on campus were able to use the advanced scene shop and costume shop for working on their shows, but the building's theatre spaces were to be reserved mainly for faculty directed shows. However, in March 2006, Nomadic Theatre were able to teamed up with the Department of Performing Arts at Georgetown for the first student production ever staged in the Devine Theatre of the building. In 2007, Nomadic became the first group to have a full-scale, student-run show in the Devine, with Translations. Since then Nomadic has regularly performed in the building. In the Spring of 2010 members of Nomadic Theatre were instrumental in the organization of Hate-Free Georgetown, a week- long celebration to \\"promote unity and respect on campus\\".

Lyster, M.D. (10 July 1875 ‚Äì 5 August 1933) was a United States Army physician and aviation medicine pioneer. In 1918, Lyster established an army laboratory that put aviation medicine on a sound scientific basis in the United States and he insisted on making military aviation physicians organic members of the flying squadrons, thus creating the position and role of \\"flight surgeon\\". These efforts, along with his 1917 creation of the post of chief surgeon, Aviation Section, Signal Corps and his planning and directing of the United States Army Air Medical Service, earned him the title of \\"Father of Aviation Medicine\\" or \\" Father of Army Aviation Medicine\\".French scientist Paul Bert (1833‚Äì1886) is often given the former epithet. Early life and education Theodore Charles Lyster was born at Fort Larned, Kansas, the son of U.S. Army Captain William J. and Martha Doughty Lyster. His childhood was spent in various posts around the country. At the age of seven, Lyster contracted yellow fever while living in Fort Brown, Texas. He was treated by William Gorgas, and Gorgas was credited with his recovery. Later, Gorgas married Lyster's aunt, making Lyster Gorgas's nephew by marriage. Having recovered from yellow fever, Lyster had a lifelong immunity to it. He received his Ph.B. in 1897 and his in M.D. in 1899, both from the University of Michigan. In June 1898, Lyster entered the army as a private and hospital steward. Military career  On October 3, 1900, he was commissioned as a surgeon. Lyster subsequently served as the Chief of the Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic at Ancon (Canal Zone) Hospital, Panama and Chief of the Eye Service in the University of Philippines, Manila. In 1914, during the American occupation of Vera Cruz, Mexico, Lyster served there as Chief Health Officer. =World War I= A month after the United States entered World War I, Lyster was promoted to lieutenant colonel. It was by War Department Special Order 207 (September 6, 1917) that Lyster became the first chief surgeon, Aviation Section, Signal Corps, United States Army‚Äîa position he had recommended as essential to fully realize the capability of Army aviation and provide adequate medical support to it. He was also Chief of Aviation and Professional Services in The Surgeon General's Office in 1917 and 1918, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award. With the expansion of the army and his new duties as chief surgeon, he rose to brigadier general in March 1918. Lyster as a colonel, c. 1917 Following a visit to Europe in 1918, Lyster conducted numerous research studies on the \\"Care of the Flyer\\" which led to substantial improvements in treatment and recovery. Learning from the British experience during the first years of World War I, Lyster made two important contributions to the efficiency and safety of flying. First, he emphasized physical standards for pilots. The British had cut flying fatalities from 60% to 20% by screening pilots for medical defects. This emphasis led Lyster to champion an extensive research program. This program was under the control of a board \\"with discretionary powers to investigate all conditions affecting the physical efficiency of pilots, to carry out experiments and tests at different flying schools, to provide suitable apparatus for the supply of oxygen ... [and] to act as a standing organization for instruction in the physiological requirements of aviators.\\" This board established the first laboratory of its kind and put aviation medicine on a sound scientific basis in the United States. Lyster's second major contribution was to insist on making aviation surgeons be organic parts of the squadrons. This arrangement meant that surgeons familiar with aviation would deploy with the flying units, rather than being part of a larger medical organization that would be slower to respond. This organization, as well as the emphasis Lyster put on selection and training of aviation surgeons, produced the concept of the flight surgeon. Although Lyster's most significant contribution was pioneering aviation medicine, he was instrumental in many other areas. He was primarily responsible for standardizing and expediting physical examinations (1917) and in organizing the Medical Research Board (1918). He was a member of several civilian medical organizations and made many valuable contributions to medical literature. His studies of yellow fever and his work in otorhinolaryngology are of lasting relevance. In retirement Lyster retired from active duty on 28 February 1919, reverting to his permanent rank of colonel. After the death of Dr Gorgas, Lyster carried on his work with the Rockefeller Foundation (1920‚Äì24) of eliminating yellow fever from Mexico and Central America. He served as medical examiner of the U.S. Department of Commerce, organizing the first issuing of licenses to commercial aviators. He also served as president of the Southern California Medical Association. By an Act of Congress in June, 1930, Lyster was promoted (restored) to \\"Brigadier General, Retired\\". Death  He died in Los Angeles, California on August 5, 1933, aged 58, of coronary sclerosis and angina pectoris.\\"Theodore C. Lyster\\" [Obit]; JAMA, 16 Sept 1933, pg 944. Legacy * The Theodore C.

It tends to grow alone, apart from other members of its species, and is browsed by elk and livestock. Description =Growth pattern= It is a perennial herb growing from a woody base surrounded by rosettes of large leaves that measure up to 50 centimeters long by 15 wide. =Stems and leaves= It produces a single erect stem which can reach two meters in height. =Inflorescence and fruit= The stem bears whorls of lance-shaped, pointed leaves smaller than those at the base. The plant is monocarpic, growing for several years and only flowering once before it dies.Weid, A. and C. Galen. (1998).

It is not known why some plants in an area will not flower in a mass flowering event, or what cues the plants rely on to initiate flowering. The inflorescence is a tall, erect panicle with flowers densely clustered at the top and then spread out in interrupted clusters below. Each flower has a calyx of four pointed sepals and a corolla of four pointed lobes each one to two centimeters long. The corolla is yellow-green with purple spots and each lobe has two fringed nectary pits at the base. There are four stamens tipped with large anthers and a central ovary. It blooms from July to August.

An LDR functions in much the same way as a global depository receipt (GDR). LDRs may represent ownership of either an underlying number of shares or a notional amount of bonds. Luxembourg Depository Receipts are particularly useful where an institution wants to ensure safe keeping of assets, i.e., in Luxembourg, but needs a specific national or regional banks' expertise in handling a variety of transactions (such as the sale of shares to local markets). Prices of LDRs are often close to the value of the related instrument but they are traded and settled independently and often in smaller lots (particularly in the case of bonds). Trading and settlement of LDRs is difficult to quantify as the use of local markets makes analyzing the size of this market quite difficult.

The book is a transition between the first series, The 39 Clues, and the second, Cahills vs. Vespers. It was written by Rick Riordan, Peter Lerangis, Gordon Korman, and Jude Watson. The book was released on April 5, 2011. Unlike the other 10 books (with the exception of the last one), the title card shows a series of dots rather than a globe. Plot This book has four plot lines. The first describes Gideon's discovery of the master serum and betrayal by his friend and first Vesper, Damien Vesper. The second recounts Madeleine Cahill's life and her attempt to reunite the Cahill family. The third tells of Grace's first mission to Casablanca, as she competes against George S. Patton to retrieve Gideon's gold ring. The fourth describes Amy and Dan's retrieval of Gideon's ring that Grace bequeathed to Amy, while escaping from Casper Wyoming, a Vesper member who is after it. =Gideon Cahill, 1507= The first part recounts the story of Gideon Cahill and Damien Vesper, and the inception of the empowering serum made of 39 ingredients. It is set in the year of 1507, when the Black Death was abound, and a third of the European population had been claimed. Cahill allows Vesper to use his, Cahill's, ancestral island as a retreat from the plague. This proves to be a problem because Vesper wants Cahill's serum, which he made to help cure the plague. Vesper, however, wants it for the purposes of power. Cahill gives each of his children a quarter of the serum and tells them to flee the island. During the night, before they can leave, Vesper's comes in search of the serum; but the Cahill sets off an explosion in his laboratory. The house is set on fire, yet all four of Gideon's children: Luke, Jane, Thomas, and Katherine; plus his wife, Olivia, survive. The children quickly begin blaming each other for the fire and leave in two separate groups: Luke and Jane, and Thomas and Katherine. This leaves Olivia alone, and she vows to re-unite the family, with the help of her unborn daughter, Madeleine. =Madeleine Cahill, 1526= Madeleine Cahill runs from home after the Vespers arrive and kill her mother. She finds Luke and becomes a governess to his son. However, when Luke inquires (as he had found her ring, which had once belonged to Gideon), she reveals that she is his sister. Luke, however, refuses to believe her, as he had heard similar claims before, and believes her to be working with Vesper, and orders her beheading in the morning. Madeleine escapes, and attempts to find the ring (aware of its \\"dark past\\"). Luke finds Vesper, who now has the ring, and attacks him, attempting to avenge his father. He fails, however, and is presumably killed. His son finds a note nearby: Beware the Madrigals. =Grace Cahill, 1942= Grace, a thirteen-year-old girl, troubled with raising baby Fiske, the disappearance of her father James, and the death of her mother Edith, receives a Morse code transmission telling her to go to Casablanca, to find General George S. Patton, leader of Operation Torch, to find Gideon's ring in \\"bulls-eye\\". Concluding that General Patton is a Cahill, Grace sneaks out of her home to deliver the message herself. She meets a pilot named Drago, and rides his plane \\"Olga\\" to Casablanca. As they arrive, Drago is killed, but reveals that Olga is named for his daughter. She meets General Patton and delivers the message, but grows ambitious and searches for it herself. She finds the location, but sees that the hidden ring is gone. Patton reveals that he too, had found it empty, but a slight bulge in his pocket tells her otherwise. Realizing that Patton is actually a Vesper, she steals the ring and returns to her family in Monaco. =Amy and Dan Cahill, Vespers= Amy and Dan's normal lives take a dramatic turn when Uncle Fiske reveals to them that Grace's ring is hidden in Switzerland. Aware of the Vespers following them, they find a decoded message that leads them to her chalet in the Alps. They find the ring, but are attacked by Vesper spies, and escape with the help of Fiske's friend Erasmus, a fellow Madrigal, and they return to Boston, aware that they must prepare if they are to defeat this new threat. The next series will talk about how Amy and Dan have to find the Vespers, for they have taken many of Amy and Dan's cousins as hostages, and are willing to kill them for something very big that they want.

First flown in 1962, nearly 100 have been built and others remain under construction. Design and development The Menestrel (en: Minstral), a single-engine low-wing cantilever monoplane, was designed for homebuilders. Three variants have appeared over the course of about 27 years: the original single seat HN 433 Menestrel flew in 1962, the more powerful HN 434 Super Menestrel in 1985 and the larger two-seat HN 700/1 Menestrel II in 1989. All Menestrel variants are wooden framed and fabric covered. The wing is built around a single spar and has constant chord to mid span, with semi- elliptical outer panels. There are no flaps fitted on the single seat variants, though they are an option on the Menestrel II. The fin and rudder are curved, the rudder having a horn balance. The tailplane is mounted on the top of the fuselage. The fuselage is structurally of simple square section, with a curved decking aft of the cockpit. The latter was originally open but the prototype later flew with a smooth plexiglass canopy that merged into the decking. The Menestrel II has side by side seating. Most Menestrels have a tailskid or, later, tailwheel undercarriage with cantilever main legs bearing Vespa scooter wheels. Many Menestrels have faired legs and spatted wheels. At least one Menestrel II, with the type number HN 701TM, uses a tricycle undercarriage. Menestrels have been powered by a variety of engines, mostly variants of the Volkswagen flat-4 engine. Early versions of these were entirely air-cooled, but more recently the cylinder heads have been water- cooled. Some early Menestrels with air-cooled engines have exposed cylinder heads for cooling but more have semi-cylindrical, bulged fairings to enclose them. The water-cooled engines used in the Menestrel II have cowlings which enclose the whole engine without additional fairings, with an air intake behind the propeller. The first HN 433 Menestrel had a 22 kW (30 hp) 1.3 L engine; later HN 433s have had engines in the 22-37 kW (30-50 hp) power range. Super Menestrels have used 1.6 L engines, producing powers of 26-49 kW (35-65 hp). The HN 700 Menestrel II uses one of two Limbach engines of 2.0 L or 2.4 L capacity. Operational history British registered two-seat HN700 Menestrel II The first prototype HN 433 flew on 25 November 1962 and Menestrel aircraft have continued to be home built from plans since then. 4 more HD 433s have appeared on the French register. The more powerful HN 434 proved more popular, with 23 on the French register and 1 on the Finnish. The two-seat HN 700 has been the most successful of the three variants in numerical terms. 56 have been registered in France and at least one in Spain. In the UK 8 examples have had Permits to Fly. Others remain under construction. The only HN 701 to appear on the French register, F-PLMT, has a tricycle undercarriage. A Centre d'essais en vol evaluation of the HN 434 declared it to be the best handling sportplane in Europe.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 100.

For 30 years he has been a popular personality in Birmingham, while making stops in Nashville (WKDA/KDF), San Diego (KPRI), Denver (KBCO), New Orleans (WQUE-Q93), and Mobile (WABB-FM). Mr. Calhoun has been a night-time/morning drive personality at several Birmingham radio stations and later in his career became known for his syndicated dark wave show, The Edge. Coyote J was part of the original air staff hired by WKDF, Nashville's progressive rock station, and WRAX (The X) Birmingham's Alternative Rock station. . Nashville: WKDA-FM/WKDF-FM =Switch from automation to live= WKDA-FM went live in the evening hours and on weekends with a progressive rock format in the early winter of 1970 and Coyote worked on air under the name Jim Battan, sometimes spelled Jim Baton, while still in high school; this came after a short stint on WKDA-AM where he worked under a number of different names. Mr. Battan did weekends, but also did 7-12 midnight in summer/autumn of 1970. Pensacola Battan went to WBSR AM in 1973 to do 7-12 midnight and experiment with a more brash, TOP 40 style that he would later bring to Birmingham, New Orleans and San Diego. Birmingham Battan began his Birmingham stints in late 1973 when he joined ERC-FM, employing the same format he had used at WKDF-FM Nashville; WERC AM ‚Äî Coyote J (Calhoun) is Born In 1975, Battan was hired by WERC Birmingham as a night-time Top 40 screamer. When WERC night time jock Chris Foxx (aka 'Superfoxx') abruptly quit over a contract dispute in late 1974, the company flipped Battan to WERC's AM from the FM and christened him Coyote J Calhoun (this time the name would stick). From 1975 to 1979 Coyote J was enormously popular in Birmingham and consistently won the 12 + audience during his reign. In one of his most controversial acts, Coyote J faked his own murder on-air, a stunt that led police and paramedics to storm the building expecting to find a knife wielding intruder inside. This led to a 5-day suspension, the first of many that would be handed down to the disc-jockey. Calhoun wrestled a live black bear before a packed house at Boutwell Auditorium in 1976. The fight abruptly ended after Coyote hit the bear over the head with a folding chair, annoying its handlers. When asked why he did it, Coyote replied, 'he started it.' In 1979, near the end of WERC's dominance and with the demise of AM Top 40 radio in sight, Coyote J resigned and left for Los Angeles to do stand up comedy and immerse himself in the neophyte punk/new wave scene. L.A. and San Diego: The 1980s and the Switch to New Wave and Punk In 1980, Coyote J. worked with the improv group 'The L.A. Connection'. In 1981 Coyote moved to KPRI to do 7to midnight and officially became a provocateur of new wave/post punk music on commercial radio. While in San Diego Calhoun worked as a bona fide shock jock. Back to 'Bama In 1983, after a short stay in Denver, Coyote J left the West Coast to head back south with a bevy of new wave in tow and began playing this 'new music' throughout the southeast. Coyote took the specialty show gig at WAPI-FM Birmingham (95 Rock) and began spinning another generation's soundtrack: The Pretenders, A Flock Of Seagulls, Human League, Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran, U2, Talk Talk, The Cure, Wall Of Voodoo, Depeche Mode, Echo and The Bunnymen, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark among others. In 1984 Coyote was transferred to WABB-FM Mobile, the sister station of I-95 (Dittman), where he did afternoons on the CHR and his new music show for PD Leslie Fram (99X Atlanta); That same year Calhoun won the 'Bobby Poe Air Personality of the Year' award. In 1996, Coyote J married Vicki Anglin, in 2001, they had a son Trey. They now have three sons, Jason, Brian, (the oldest) and Trey (the youngest). New Orleans In 1985 Coyote J landed the 7-midnight opening at WQUE-FM New Orleans. At 'Q-93' the dj debut an expanded version of his post punk program and began to use the name The Edge. In New Orleans Calhoun began incorporating dark wave, gothic, and Industrial to his new music play list. Q-93 flipped from CHR to urban in late 1986 and Coyote was cut loose. Back to Birmingham and 20 years of The Edge Coyote J found himself back in Birmingham in the spring of 1987, once again employed as a night-time screamer for a new personality-driven CHR, WZBQ, Z-102 (going up against the other Top 40 stations in town, I-95, as well as WKXX, KICKS 106). Calhoun reintroduced his Sunday night show as The Edge to Tuscaloosa, Birmingham and surrounding areas. While at Z-102.5 Coyote found himself in the middle of controversy once again, culminating with Calhoun getting fired live on the air. Before it was over Coyote was being escorted out of the building by police officers who heard the ruckus live on air and rushed to the station. Coyote was reinstated for a short time afterwards, but was let go from Z-102 for keeps in 1989. In 1989 Coyote J was hired by I-95, Z's cross town rival. I-95 OM Randy Lane decided to make him part of their new morning team to replace the popular duo, Mark and Brian, who had left for KLOS Los Angeles. The Morning Wake Up Service with Andy Spinosi, Trey Matthews and Coyote J debut in the spring of 1989. I-95 decided NOT to resign the trio in 1992. In 1992 The Edge went into syndication. From 1992 to 2002 The Edge aired on dozens of Alabama outlets: WVNA-Muscle Shoals, WQEN Gadsden, WTGZ Auburn, WHHY Montgomery, Z102.5 Tuscaloosa/Birmingham, I-95 and WRAX Birmingham, among others. During the years 1992-1994 Coyote also co-founded and wrote comedy for JAB, a Birmingham satirical magazine, along with Andy Spinosi, Tim Spinosi and Frank Cummings. JAB went to press eight times and closed their doors in early 1995. The X Years In 1995, Coyote J was hired as one of the original air talents to help launch The X (WRAX-FM) in Birmingham. Between 1998-2002 Coyote also wrote music reviews for The Birmingham Weekly. Coyote J stayed with The X until December 2006 when the station fell on hard times and flipped to Adult A/C. In January 2007 The Edge re-debut in Birmingham on ROCK 99.5 in its usual Sunday night time slot. Coyote J's contract for The Edge with ROCK 99/WZRR expired January 2009, at which time Coyote J pulled The Edge plug for good and retired the show. Coyote J returned to ROCK 99 to do a classic rock show in February 2009. Coyote left Citadel Broadcasting February 14, 2010 ending a tenure that spanned 15 years. In 2010 Coyote J began collaborating with the German dark wave band, Feeding Fingers and co-produced their third album, Detach Me From My Head. The album yielded three top 10 chart hits in Europe. Battan is currently working with Feeding Fingers and songwriter Justin Curfman on the band's fourth album. April 2012 saw the release of a new single by Feeding Fingers, 'Inside The Body Of An Animal' produced by Coyote J and Justin. Feeding Fingers fourth album, 'The Occupant', was released in late February 2013. Because of Justin Curfman's relocation to Germany the album had a number of producers. On this release Coyote J co-produced only three tracks: 'Inside The Body Of An Animal', 'I Drink Disappearing Ink' and 'Paper Dolls Would Eat Glass For Us,' as well as providing financial support. \\"Polaroid Papercuts\\" an advance single from the upcoming Feeding Fingers triple album 'Attend' produced by Coyote J and Dana Culling was released on March 16, 2015. In 2018 Coyote J produced Feeding Fingers eighth album, 'Do Owe Harm' on the Tephramedia label (Germany).

Early life and training Born in Havana, Alfonso Cat√° was the son of a diplomat in service to the government of Fulgencio Batista, president of Cuba from 1933 to 1959. When Alfonso was a boy, his father was posted to Geneva, Switzerland, and he was educated in private schools there, adding French and English to his native Spanish. Details of his early life are obscure, but he may also have begun his ballet training with Swiss teachers. In any case, when his family moved to the United States about 1950 and settled in New York City, his interest in dance was strong enough to cause him to enroll at the School of American Ballet. There, he was trained in the principles of classical ballet technique developed by George Balanchine, to whom he would remain devoted for the rest of his life.Anonymous, \\"Alfonso Cat√°, 53, Dancer, Teacher, and Ballet Director,\\" obituary, International New York Times, 22 September 1990. Performing career During his career as a dancer, Cat√° performed with several major ballet companies in Europe and America. In 1956, at age 19, he joined Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris, which performed in various cities in France and on tour to neighboring countries. Cat√° danced minor roles in many works in the company repertory, appearing on stage with Zizi Jeanmaire in Petit's Carmen and with Violette Verdy in Le Loup.J.P. Wearing, The London Stage 1950-1959: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel, 2nd ed. (London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2014). After a time with this company, he left to join the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, also based in Paris, where he appeared in the company's famous 1960 production of The Sleeping Beauty, staged by Bronislava Nijinska and Robert Helpmann and starring Nina Vyrubova and Serge Golovine.Clement Crisp, \\"Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas,\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research (Edinburgh), Summer 2005, pp. 1-17. In, 1961, Cat√° left France and moved to Germany, where he joined the Stuttgart Ballet, then being re-formed by South-Africa-born John Cranko. He took with him his Brazilian girlfriend, Marcia Hayd√©e, who would become Cranko's muse, prima ballerina of the company, internationally known star of Cranko's narrative ballets, and his eventual successor as artistic director of the company.Horst Koegler, \\"Hayd√©e, Marcia,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 3, p. 350. Upon returning to New York, Cat√° resumed his studies at the School of American Ballet and at the Joffrey School, where he improved his technical mastery. In 1964 he was among the first group of young professionals organized by Robert Joffrey into a company, along with Robert Blankshire, Wilhelm Burmann, Zelma Bustillo, Diana Carter, Luis Fuente, Hilda Morales, and Trinette Singleton.Sasha Annawalt, The Joffrey Ballet: Robert Joffrey and the Making of an American Ballet Company (New York: Scribner's, 1996). The newly named Joffrey Ballet made its debut at the New York City Center of Music and Drama in 1965, but Cat√° did not remain long with the troupe, soon leaving to join the corps of New York City Ballet, then resident at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Although happy to be dancing the Balanchine repertory, he decided, at age 30, to retire from the stage. In 1967, he left New York City Ballet and opened a boutique, called Yasny (\\"You ain't seen nothin' yet\\"), on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he sold dresses he had designed and Latin American pottery and jewelry.Anonymous, \\"Alfonso Cat√°, 53, Dancer, Teacher, and Ballet Director\\" obituary, International New York Times, 22 September 1990. Gregarious and charming, he attracted patrons to his shop from a wide surrounding neighborhood, including Balanchine, who would sometimes stop by for a chat. Directorial and choreographic career In 1969, Balanchine nominated Cat√° to become artistic director of the moribund ballet company of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve. It was an attractive offer, especially because of his childhood memories of the city, and a welcome opportunity that he was glad to accept. With Balanchine acting as artistic adviser, he took over leadership of the company, made dramatic reforms, and revitalized the repertory.Anne Davier, \\"Alfonso Cat√°,\\" in Dictionnaire du Th√©√¢tre en Suisse (Zurich: Chronos, 2005), p. 358. During the four years of his tenure (1969-1973), he introduced many of Balanchine's best works to appreciative Swiss audiences. Among them were S√©r√©nade (music, Tchaikovsky), Symphonie en Ut (Bizet), Apollon Musag√®te (Stravinsky), Les Quatre Temp√©raments (Hindemith), Concerto Barocco (Bach), Divertimento No. 15 (Mozart), Symphonie Ecossaise (Mendelssohn), Square Dance (Corelli and Vivaldi), and Who Cares\\"? (Gershwin).Peter Williams, \\"Mr. B's Man in Geneva: The Ballet of Geneva's Grand Th√©√¢tre in All-Balanchine Program,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), May 1971, pp. 32-36. These masterworks were supplemented by choreographies of his own, including La Nuit de Mai (music, Leoncavallo), Les Saisons (Glazunov), Sonatine pour Violon et Percussion (Pierre M√©tral), Pierre et le Loup (Prokofiev), Le Carnaval des Animaux (Saint-Saƒõns), Nuit Transfigur√©e (Schoenberg), and Concerto pour Percussion, Piano, et Orchestre √† Cordes (Tom√°s Swoboda). He also provided dances for operas and operettas: Un Ballo in Maschere (Verdi, 1970), La Belle Hel√®ne (Offenbach, 1971), L'√âtoile (Chabrier, 1971), and La Veuve Joyeuse (L√©har, 1972).Archives, Informations et Recherch√© du Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve, website, http://archives.genevaopera.ch.recherches. Retrieved 12 December 2015. Balanchine provided not only artistic advice; he sent Cat√° some of his most promising students from the School of American Ballet in New York. Among them were Claudia Jescke and Chris Jensen, who, at 19, partnered Violette Verdy in a Balanchine pas de deux from La Source at an international gala that Cat√° had organizedSouvenir program, Ballet Gala, Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve, 17 October 1971. and who would go on to an illustrious career as a principal dancer with the Basel Ballet and as ballet master of the Zurich Ballet. Other talented members of the company were the French dancer Dominique Bagouet, the English dancer David Allen, his French wife Claudine Kamoun, and the Swiss dancer Heinz Spoerli, who had established a reputation in Germany and Canada.No√´l Goodwin, \\"Cross-Channeled,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), January 1984, pp. 35-36. Encouraged by Cat√°, Spoerli choreographed his first major ballet, Le Chemin, in 1972. The success of this work, set to a commissioned electronic score by Eric Gaudibert and performed by Ruth Weber and Chris Jensen, launched Spoerli's career as the foremost Swiss choreographer of the twentieth century.Horst Koegler, Heinz Spoerli: Weltb≈±rger des Ballets (Zurich: Verlag Neue Z≈±rcher Zeitung, 2012). Over the next two decades, Cat√° worked as artistic director of three major dance companies: the Frankfurt Ballet in Germany (1973-1977), the Baltimore Ballet in the United States (1980-1981), and the Ballet du Nord in France (1983-1990). In the intervals between these jobs, he taught at various schools in New York City and elsewhere. As founder of the Ballet du Nord in Roubaix, France, close to the Belgian border, he remained active in the post of company director, chief choreographer, and teacher until his death in 1990. He built the company repertory on fourteen Balanchine ballets and such works as Concerto, set to music of Keith Emerson by Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, Les Nuits d'√âte, set to music of Hector Berlioz by Jean-Paul Comelin, and a number of works of his own devising. Among them were ballets to two evocative orchestral compositions: Nuits dans les Jardins d'Espagne by Manuel de Falla and La Mer by Claude Debussy.Anna Kisselgoff, \\"Ballet du Nord Performs in Brooklyn,\\" International New York Times, 19 October 1987. The company eventually evolved into the Centre Chor√©graphique National Roubaix‚ÄìNord-Pas-de-Calais (CNN), specializing in experimental contemporary dance.Margaret E. Willis, \\"Cat√° and His Ballet du Nord: France's Northern Lights,\\" Dance Magazine (New York), October 1987, pp. 50-53.

Retrieved 13 December 2015. Burmann's career was inextricably linked with Cat√°'s own. He danced with the Stuttgart Ballet, the Frankfurt Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet, the New York City Ballet, and the Geneva company, where he also served as ballet master. He later became a popular teacher at Steps on Broadway in New York City.

The Venerable Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, relates that Saint Ultan joined the mission led by Saint Fursey which went from Ireland through British territory to East Anglia around 633 AD, to the kingdom of King Sigeberht of East Anglia. The monastery at Cnobheresburg, of which he was a member, was established in the precinct of an old, stone-built, Roman shore-fort near the sea. The King received them and endowed the monastery, and it was later re- endowed by King Anna of East Anglia and his nobles.B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Mynors, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969), 268-277: Bede, HE iii.18. Following the attack on the monastery in 651 by Penda of Mercia, Anna of East Anglia was forced by Penda to flee into exile. The location is unknown. The site is commonly identified with Burgh Castle (Norfolk) near the mouth of the river Yare, thought to be the Garianonum of the Notitia Dignitatum and of the geographical description of Britain by Claudius Ptolemy.Louis Dahl, The Roman Camp and the Irish Saint at Burgh Castle (Jarrold, London 1913).

A detailed report by Norfolk Museums Service in 1983 (East Anglian Archaeology 20) shows that there was never any monastic settlement in Burgh Castle itself.

It is now obsolete. History The Orange Free State republic became a British colony at the end of the Anglo-Boer War in May 1902. The republic's official arms were discontinued, and on 10 December 1904, by Royal Warrant, King Edward VII granted a new coat of arms to the colony. The springbok was chosen as the principal charge in the arms. Although it had made its appearance in heraldry nearly thirty years earlier (in the crest of the arms granted to Edward Randles of Port Natal in 1875), this appears to have been the first time that the animal was used as a charge on a shield. Pama, C. (1965). Lions and Virgins Brownell, F.G. (1993). National and Provincial Symbols When the colony became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the provincial administration took over the arms, which it used until 1925. In 1937, after a twelve-year period without official arms, the provincial administration adopted the old republican arms, which were used as the provincial arms until the Orange Free State was reconstituted as the Free State Province in 1994.

In 1834 he married Margaret Vosburg. The couple had two children: Mrs. William J. Waterman and well-known dramatist Bronson Howard. In 1840, Howard came to Detroit, now a partner in the shipping firm of Bronson, Crocker, and Howard, to establish an agency for the firm. In 1848, he entered a partnership with N. P. Stewart, continuing his shipping and forwarding business and also as a railroad contractor, building substantial portions of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad line, although his firm lost $280,000 in the project. In 1854, Howard dissolved his partnership with Stewart and formed another one with his brother, Sebre. Howard was simultaneously president of the Farmer's and Mechanics Bank and the Peninsular Bank, and in 1848 he was elected mayor of Detroit. The Panic of 1857 caused the failure of the Peninsular Bank, and in 1858, Charles Howard moved to New York City.

They then released their first full- length album, Make Your Mark the following year. Both albums were re-released in 2009 after the band signed to Adeline Records; Dude Manor on 10\\" vinyl and Make Your Mark on 12\\" vinyl. Music videos were made for the songs \\"A Bottle of Charades\\" from Make Your Mark and \\"Later is Better\\" from Dude Manor. The band started preparing and recording their second full-length album titled Holy Shit in early 2010, set for release on May 17, 2011. They also went through several member changes; Shayne Lundberg was replaced by Bill Crook of A Textbook Tragedy on bass, and singer Matt Postal was replaced by Stuart Ross of Lowtalker and Misery Signals. The band released their second full-length album, Holy Shit, on May 17, 2011, shortly after releasing a music video for \\"Honesty, Honestly\\". Holy Shit is the first release to feature the new singer, Stu Ross (Lowtalker, Misery Signals). Bassist Shayne Lundberg completed his parts for the album before Bill Crook (A Textbook Tragedy) had joined. Shortly after the release of Holy Shit, the band took criticism from American media and the Canadian Heritage minister regarding the album's physical content, with packaging and liner notes that imitate the bible and depict Jesus Christ as a turd. In 2012, Stu Ross left the band to play guitar in Comeback Kid and Matt Postal briefly rejoined. Postal's last show with the band was in August.

It rises near the Berkshire village of Mortimer, and is a tributary of Burghfield Brook. Route Lockram Brook rises in various areas of woodland and farmland near Mortimer. These include drains in Brocas Plantation, to the west of Reading Road, and springs on Wokefield Common and in Starvale Woods further east. of Wokefield Common are managed as a nature reserve by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust, where the woodland is regularly thinned to preserve the heathland environment. A separate branch begins at springs on Long Moor, a little further to the south, which join up before passing under Loogmoor Road. More springs flow northwards from Lukin's Wood, before the branch and the main brook join by a road called Brewery Common, to the east of which is a spoon-shaped pond. It travels north east towards Wokefield, passing under Lockrams Lane near Wokefield Farm. There is a pleasant valley here where the brook is dammed to form a small body of water known as Millbarn Pond.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map It has been a fish pond since at least 1911, and covers an area of Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1911 The dam was constructed in the 18th century, creating a pond with a maximum depth of and a surface which is above sea level. The water is eutrophic, with high levels of nutrients supporting a diverse range of aquatic plants, and outflow from the lake is small, except in wet weather. The pond has been the location for the long term study of caddisfly by M I Crichton, who studied the pond environment between 1951 and 1982. Using a Robinson light trap, he identified 71 species of caddisfly at the site, including 24 of the 59 species of Limnephilidae resident in Britain. There is a sluice by the dam at the lower end of the pond, where the water cascades down seven brick steps into a deeply-shaded valley. Travelling further north east through Rookery Wood it passes under Goring Lane at Waterfall Cottage, where there was a small pond on the upstream side of the road in 1899, with a sluice controlling the outflow.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1899 Soon afterwards it merges with Burghfield Brook at James's Farm in Grazeley Green. The watercourse is particularly liable to flooding and has been the subject of discussion at West Berkshire Council meetings. After the junction, Burghfield Brook continues to the north east, skirting around the southern and eastern edges of the Atomic Weapons Establishment Burghfield, and under Burnthouse Bridge, before merging with the much larger Foudry Brook near Hartley Court Farm. Water Quality The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail. Lockram Brook is not sufficiently large to get its own entry in the Environment Agency's catchment data. However, under the criteria of the Water Framework Directive, water quality includes an assessment of how easily fish can move along the river, and the presence of a stepped weir at the outflow to Millbarn Pond means that it would probably be rated poor or bad.

Duffy has two Mickey Mouse features, similar shaped face and hip Mickey birthmark. Duffy is unique among Disney characters in that he was not first featured in a Disney movie or TV show until he made his television debut in the 2010 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade. History The Disney Bear was originally created for and briefly sold at the Disney World's Downtown Disney Once Upon a Toy shop in Orlando in 2002 as a unique product for its opening. With The Oriental Land Company executives looking for fresh ideas and the teddy bears being culturally popular, the company adopted the character in 2004, giving it a name, a sailor suit and a backstory. They aggressively marketed it in the Tokyo DisneySea park. He was added as a walk-around character, becoming a regular character in 2005. In 2005, the bear, as \\"My First Disney Bear,\\" was the boys' substitute toy given out at the Perfectly Princess Tea Party at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. Executives next added the My Friend Duffy show at a DisneySea restaurant. Due to Duffy's popularity amongst Japanese fans, limits were set on the number a guest could buy. Women aged 20 to 35 lined up at stores with any new costume release. Through the One Disney theme-park/corporate initiative of sharing IP/ideas, Duffy the Disney Bear was exported to the other Disney Parks. Duffy was released at the American Disney parks on October 14, 2010. He then joined Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on November 19, 2010. DisneySea began expanding the Duffy franchise with the addition of three Duffy's friends starting in 2011. His girlfriend, ShellieMay was debuted that year with Gelatoni the Cat in 2014. StellaLou, a bunny, was introduced on April 4, 2017 as a part of Easter celebration at the park. The next two friends debuted at other Disney Parks and Resorts. In 2018, Hong Kong Disneyland debuted Cookie the Dog. 'Olu the Turtle was introduced at Aulani in July 2018. Fictional character history Duffy was previously known as \\"The Disney Bear\\" with an entirely different backstory. In the original story, Tinker Bell gave Mickey's face to the blank faced and nameless teddy bear. As the current Duffy story goes, Minnie Mouse hand sewed Duffy for Mickey Mouse as he was packing for a long voyage at sea and presented him in a duffel bag, hence his name.

Community spirit finds expression in individual or group activities in which members of a community choose to engage for the benefit of that community. These activities may be locally organised, or informal and spontaneous. Nature of community spirit According to Amitai Etzioni, community spirit is a unity of people in society who uphold and share similar values and resources. It is a prerequisite for community spirit that individuals are willing to a degree to sacrifice their own interests for the good of the community. Community spirit is associated with voluntary work, favours and gestures of goodwill by residents and local businesses. A dictionary definition of \\"community spirit\\" is \\"willingness and desire to participate in activities that promote a community\\".Definition of \\"community spirit\\", Collins English Dictionary. The measure of community spirit is subjective, but could be assessed from the achievements resulting from community activities, in addition to the level of contentment expressed by community members. According to Durkheim, Collective effervescence indicates the intensity of group bonds through communal gatherings such as religious meetings. These bonds people create within a group ‚Äògenerate a kind of electricity that quickly transports them to an extraordinary degree of exaltation‚Äô.Law, Alex. Key Concepts in Classical Social Theory. Los Angeles: SAGE Publications, 2011. Print. Meaning, when people come together in such near proximity and share the sense of group, it generates a high degree of happiness. Thus, creating a feeling of collectiveness which reinforces social bonds. This feeling is initiated when there is Group cohesiveness, for example, when individuals share the same life experience the sense of group occurs.Kunin, Seth Daniel. Religion: The Modern Theories. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2003. Print. The expression of community spirit entails a group or individual engaging in activities that benefit the community, whats bonds the group in community spirit is the goal. The group works towards the same common goal, which is to better the community by committing positive acts of voluntary work. Activities making for community spirit Improvements to a community can be achieved by its members voluntarily working together on community projects or acting on gestures of goodwill.Etzioni, Amitai. The new golden rule: Community and morality in a democratic society. Basic Books, 1998. Examples of such contributions could include removing debris from the streets or public parks; organizing a community fair, a school fete or a charity event at a local venue; or rallying round when a community member is in need of support. Standing groups such as a neighbourhood watch or Women's Institute may also help create community spirit. Street Watch volunteers working with police in Olton, Solihull, UK.Community spirit is showcased through the efforts of community work. Community work is often carried out by members of a community involved in local groups, neighborhood groups or associations which engage in public service. Community work contributes to the community as a whole with acts of benefit to the public interest.Staff. \\"What Is Community Work?\\" What Is Community Work?

Community spirit can be displayed in forms of customized apparel. For example, the community logo can be placed on T-shirts, baseball caps, or bumper stickers.

Its staff includes professionals from the fields of civil, structural, mechanical engineering, architecture, geology, chemistry, ceramics and materials science. Serving clients from around the globe, CTLGroup maintains corporate offices and laboratories in Chicago (Skokie, Illinois) and Doha, State of Qatar and consulting offices in Austin, TX; Bradenton, FL; and Washington, DC. Services for clients in New York and North Carolina are provided through CTL Engineers & Construction Technology Consultants. Background CTLGroup began in 1916 as the research and development laboratory for the Portland Cement Association (PCA), which had recently moved to Chicago. The PCA was formed to develop the use of portland cement in construction, which at the time had become the most common construction material. Demand for consulting grew over the years, eventually expanding into other building materials and engineering issues. In 1986 CTLGroup became an independent firm, offering engineering, testing, and consulting services. First known as ‚ÄúConstruction Technology Laboratories,‚Äù the firm changed its name to ‚ÄúCTLGroup‚Äù in 2005 to reflect the fact that it provides both laboratory services as well as engineering consulting services. The firm's projects include involvement in the construction of the Burj Khalifa, the World Trade Center collapse investigation and work at the Stonecutters Bridge. History =2000s= CTLGroup provides highly specialized creep and shrinkage testing for supertall buildings. As construction projects rise above 984 feet, which is the minimum for supertall classification, precise calculations for creep and shrinkage become absolutely crucial. As a former research and development lab where the Pickett Effect and other important creep and shrinkage related theories and discoveries were made, CTLGroup was selected to perform much of the testing and consulting for numerous high profile projects, including the following: Trump Tower, Chicago; Al Hamra Tower, Kuwait; Freedom Tower, New York; Pentominium, Dubai; and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, Dubai. CTLGroup served as a contributor to the ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1 Standard for the Design of High Performance Green Buildings (since 2006) and ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings (since 1990). In 2003 CTLGroup completed an award-winning concrete restoration on Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple, a National Historical Landmark in Oak Park, Illinois. The firm continued work on in 2008 to restore the cantilevered south roof slab above the sanctuary of the temple. In 2001 CTLGroup‚Äôs Dr. W. Gene Corley oversaw the initial FEMA investigation and subsequent report on the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11th. His team found that the severity of the destruction was largely due to a lack of fireproofing in the building. The recommendations on structural fireproofing in Corley‚Äôs report were implemented throughout the industry. =1990s= CTLGroup evaluated deterioration and repair recommendations in monument structures in Washington, D.C., including the Lincoln Memorial and Jefferson Memorial. The firm also measured panel movements and temperature changes to determine the cause of cracks in the vertical granite panels of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at the request of the National Park Service. CTLGroup led the industry in nondestructive testing (NDT) when NDT expert Allen Davis developed and promoted the Impulse Response (IR) technique, a stress wave test used to evaluate concrete conditions. In 1995, W. Gene Corley, the ‚Äúpreeminent expert on building collapse investigations and building codes‚Äù led the investigation of the structural performance of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, following the bombing there. He served as the head of the Building Performance Assessment Team (BPAT) which involved the American Society of Civil Engineers, as well as representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the General Services Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. =1980s= When CTLGroup first became an independent subsidiary of PCA in 1986, it expanded its scope of services beyond concrete and modified its structures laboratory to incorporate the testing of steel structures. In 1986 NASA granted CTLGroup 40 grams of lunar soil, the largest amount ever awarded to industrial sectors. CTLGroup's experts, having studied the physical properties of concrete made with lunar soil, also referred to as lunarcrete, had conceived of building space stations and other structures on the moon using lunar soil. In their research the lunar material was conceived as a cementitious substitute that would help minimize supplies to be brought to the moon for a given construction project. The biggest obstacle to developing it on the moon, however, is that there is little usable hydrogen on the moon, and therefore no water with which to make concrete.

As the leading broker in the Irish market, Davy accounted for approximately 40 per cent of all dealings in Irish equities on the Irish Stock Exchange in 2009 and is the only domestically based primary dealer in Irish Government Bonds and acts as arranger on most Irish corporate bond issues. It acts as broker to 9 of the top 10 companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and 15 out of the 24 companies listed on the ESM (Ireland's equivalent of AIM). Davy is also responsible for circa 70 per cent of funds raised on the Irish Stock Exchange. According to annual accounts published Davy had retained profits at the end of 2011 of ‚Ç¨110.545 million compared with ‚Ç¨124.99 million in the previous year. This ‚Ç¨15 million reduction in its accumulated profits is believed to have been the result of the dividend payment to shareholders. When added to last year's profit, it indicates a distribution to the 100-plus staff who participated in the management buy-out of ‚Ç¨25 million. Davy closed last year with net assets of ‚Ç¨131.1 million. This is described as a \\"strong financial position\\", with its regulatory capital amounting to three times the statutory requirement. The Stockbrokers has held talks with AIB and Bank of Ireland to refinance its debts of ‚Ç¨140m, which are fully performing, and are due to be refinanced in 2014. History =1900s= James and Eugene Davy were raised in Rathmines and James, on the advice of his UCD economics professor, decided to enter stockbroking after graduating with a degree in Economics, while Eugene graduated with a Law degree. In 1926, a few years after Irish independence, James Davy became a member of the Dublin Stock Exchange and was soon joined by his brother Eugene to establish J&E; Davy, with its first office located on Westmoreland Street. At the time, Irish stockbroking was dominated by brokers who trained in London and lacked a more specific Irish perspective. The bulk of business consisted of buying and selling major British-quoted shares for private clients. It was in this environment that J&E; Davy set about building up a stockbroking business. Davy Headquarters at Dawson St, Dublin, Ireland Over the next two decades the two brothers gradually built up the company by tapping into the slowly emerging Catholic middle class, (the majority of its competitors being run by Protestants). It was also helped by Eugene Davy's contact's obtained through playing rugby, being capped 34 times for Ireland, acting as manager of the national team, and eventually becoming President of the IRFU. Their respective sons Brian and Joseph began to take control of the broker in the 1960s. Davy handled its first IPO listing on the Irish Stock Exchange in 1964. In 1988, Bank of Ireland acquired a majority stake in Davy and increased that to 90% in 1992. =2000s= In 2004, Davy opened an office in Cork providing wealth management and corporate finance services to clients in the Munster region. By 2005, Davy was responsible for the listings of over 60% of the companies on the Irish Stock Exchange. In 2006, it became independent again following a management and staff buy-out of the company with loans provided by Anglo Irish Bank for ‚Ç¨316 million, a figure acknowledged to reflect top of market conditions. This year also brought the opening of another regional office for Davy, located in Galway. Davy Private Clients invested in the Maldron Hotel Group through Dalata with former Jury's chief executive Pat McCann and TVC Holdings in 2007. The same year, Davy opened a dedicated office for Northern Ireland, located in Belfast city centre. In August 2010, Davy opened its first overseas office in London. Davy Private Clients were significant shareholders in Azur Pharma, who announced their merger in 2012 with US rival Jazz Pharmaceuticals with a Dublin headquarters. Davy was the only Irish dealer in Irish Government Bonds, when the country returned to the market for the first time since 2010 in January 2012. Davy Private Clients were part of those who secured shares in the social networking giant Facebook through their investment in Tiger Global Management's funds. 3 months later the stock lost over a quarter of its starting value, which led to the Wall Street Journal calling the IPO a \\"fiasco.\\" In 2012, Davy Research was named Ireland's No.1 brokerage and also the country's No.1 Equity Research Team in the Institutional Investor All-Europe Research Team 2012 Survey. In March 2012, following a four-month trawl, both nationally and overseas, Ivan Murphy was appointed Head of Davy Corporate Finance. Davy advised the Irish Government on the sale of the national lottery license, operated by the stated owned An Post. On 8 March 2012, Davy announced acquired Bloxham's private client business. The following May, Davy announced that it had acquired Bloxham's asset management business. The deal, together with the acquisition of Bloxham's private client business added approximately ‚Ç¨1.2billion to the value of assets under management by Davy. On 3 October 2012, Davy launched Davy Select, an online investment fund \\"supermarket\\" aimed at consumers looking to invest as little as ‚Ç¨500 in a pension. The platform ‚Äì which cost Davy ‚Ç¨10 million to develop ‚Äì was modelled on UK online fund selection sites which captured 20 per cent of the market in five years. Davy called for the abolition of exit charges by all pension providers \\"so that consumers can invest on the basis of performance and service and not be restricted by anti- consumer lock-in agreements\\". When the Irish Stock Exchange demutualised in April 2014, the broker became its largest shareholder holding 37.5% of the Exchange. Sponsorship =The Dublin Lectures 2012, The Little Museum of Dublin= On 1 March 2012, Davy announced its sponsorship of the 'Dublin Lecture Series 2012' at The Little Museum of Dublin situated on Stephens Green, Dublin. Theses lectures that take place monthly, explore the history of Dublin and her people. =The Davy Portrait Awards= On 9 June 2008, Davy launched the Inaugural Davy Portrait Awards, in association with Arts & Business. The main prizes total ‚Ç¨19,000 and were awarded by a judging panel of Royal Hibernian Academy President Stephen McKenna, Royal Ulster Academy President Rita Duffy and international art critic and writer Gemma Tipton. The 2010 Davy Portrait Award was won by Ian Cumberland, a Northern Ireland-based artist. The 2008 Davy Portrait Awards was won by Joe Dunne, a portrait artist based in Dublin. Controversy The Mahon Tribunal established that Davy, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, made a series of payments to the corrupt politician Liam Lawlor.Connolly Frank, Gilmartin, Page 184, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 12, 2014, Final report of the Mahon Tribunal In 1992, Davy made a political donation of ¬£5,000 to Bertie Ahern, which ended in his personal account at Irish Life & Permanent plc. The next year the firm was the subject of an Irish Stock Exchange inquiry over the handling of the flotation of Greencore plc, the recently privatised Irish Sugar Company. The then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds did not hold back in his criticism \\"you employ professional people to do the job...it was not done in a professional manner.\\" The Managing Partner resigned. Davy admitted that its representatives in 1999 devised a Liechtenstein based tax evasion scheme uncovered by the public service broadcaster, RT√â. A Davy spokesman confirmed that the scheme outlined in the memo was not used. In a high profile 2005 insider dealer case, the chief executive of Fyffes plc whose shares were the subject of the illicit trading said that he was \\"set up\\" by Davy and misled by a presentation to investors by Davy on behalf of his company. He also told the High Court he believed there was an arrangement between Davy and the party found responsible by the courts of insider dealing for the purpose of selling the shares they held in his company. Two reports of an investigation into the \\"wholly inappropriate sale of perpectual bonds\\" by Davy to credit unions failed to involve any of the credit unions affected, leaving them \\"in the dark and powerless to add any value to the findings of this investigation\\". The Irish Stock Exchange, who has Davy as one of its largest shareholders, and the Central Bank of Ireland then declined to give them access to the reports. The Chairman of one the Credit Unions who suffered large losses told his members The failure to publish the reports is to place the complaints process in a shroud of secrecy. Such a failure of openness, transparency and fairness can only serve to undermine confidence in the complaints process, forcing those with grievances into the courts. Such a course of action is not in the interest of any of the stakeholders.\\" A statement issued by the Irish Stock Exchange in relation to these reports acknowledged important mitigating factors such as: the changed investment demands of credit unions which were seeking higher yield investments, fundamentally altered conditions in bond markets, and the extensive interaction between Davy and its credit union clients. The Exchange stated that it was satisfied that Davy had taken appropriate remedial action to ensure that internal controls and conduct of business procedures had been rectified to mitigate against any recurrence of the breaches discovered. Davy loaned ‚Ç¨58.5 million of their clients money to the developer Bernard McNamara to fund his acquisition of a stake in the Irish Glass Bottle site in Dublin's Ringsend in 2006. In 2009 Davy took legal action against Mr. McNamara for breach of his loan obligations and secured a summary judgment in January 2010.Davy clients pursue builder, Aine Coffey, 316 words, 1 November 2009, The Sunday Times The brokers' clients never got their money back owing to the insolvency of the former billionaire however.McNamara unable to pay ‚Ç¨62.5m to investors. RT√â 13 January 2010http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0113/126304-mcnamarab/ Enfield Credit Union agreed to accept a ‚Ç¨35 million offer from Davy to credit unions affected by the sale of investment bonds to settle its claim against the stockbroking firm that it claimed Davy mis-sold to them. The terms secured by Enfield's advisers also applied to all the credit unions who are nursing losses of about ‚Ç¨75 million on the ‚Ç¨183 million worth of bonds Davy sold to them. Around 100 credit unions suffered a second round of losses because the bond that Davy acquired to compensate them for the earlier losses itself crashed in value. In December 2011, the Central Bank reprimanded and fined the firm for failing to report 61,542 transactions. Davy said that the breaches were \\"technical\\" and had been reported to the regulator by the firm in September 2010. \\"These were wholly technical reporting issues, with no client impact which were identified by Davy and voluntarily reported to the Central Bank, \\" a spokesman said. In April 2014 a young man described as \\"very vulnerable\\" with intellectual and other difficulties having suffered two strokes by the age of ten was awarded more than ‚Ç¨2m by the High Court after the stockbroking engaged in \\"deliberate neglect\\" and breach of duty of care in encouraging him to invest large amounts of his inherited ‚Ç¨5m monies in \\"seriously risky\\" contracts for difference resulting in substantial investment losses. The only child aged just 20 when he began his investment relationship with Davy using some ‚Ç¨5m inherited from his dead parents, was \\"not a person in the full of their intellectual, physical and mental health\\", the judge said and \\"should have been obvious to any observer of average perception\\" and many tests carried out on him showed \\"alarming degrees of impairment\\". There was a \\"systems failure\\" in Davy concerning its treatment of the vulnerable young man who they had sign blank paperwork, failures in its documents section and failure in responsibility by higher management, including a senior manager who certified in a \\"paper- covering exercise\\" that their client was suitable for CFD trading, the judge found. In a statement by Davy, the firm acknowledged \\"that initial trading gains recorded by the plaintiff on his Davy account were more than offset by subsequent losses during the downturn in 2008 and that processes in place at that time did not take adequate account of the plaintiff's unique circumstances,\\". It said the \\"processes in place at Davy at the time the investments were made pre-dated major regulatory changes and these had been reviewed and enhanced in line with regulatory developments since\\". Davy said that \\"it would carefully assess the outcome from the case that might benefit Davy clients in the future\\". In January 2012 the board of Siteserv announced the appointment of Davy Corporate Finance to advise (alongside KMPG) on their strategic and corporate options given the pending maturity of their debt with IBRC. 18 months after the Siteserv deal Des Carville, the Davy adviser on the transaction joined the Department of Finance. In responses to parliamentary questions posed, the Department of Finance said that Carville had declared a potential conflict of interest arising from his involvement with Siteserv before he joined. The government said he \\"has not been involved in any issues on the Siteserv transaction\\" such as approving parliamentary questions, reviewing freedom of information requests and all internal discussions on the matter. Catherine Murphy, the Independent TD who has been prominent in querying the role of the Department and State-owned IBRC in selling Siteserv at a ‚Ç¨105 million loss to taxpayers, had further answers to parliamentary questions submitted to Noonan. Murphy also asked Noonan about a possibility that the purchase of Siteserv shares using privileged information might have occurred while the sale process was ongoing. Noonan said his department does not monitor share dealing activity. In response Davy said \\"Davy would welcome any investigation that the appropriate regulatory authorities initiate in respect of sharedealings in Siteserv and are confident that any such investigation will prove these allegations to be totally without foundation.\\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/siteserv- adviser-worked-on-o-brien-s-esat-deals-1.2194400 List of main Competitors * Goodbody Stockbrokers * Cantor Fitzgerald * Bank of Ireland * Brewin Dolphin * St. James's Place plc * Investec References External links  Financial services in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Davy Group"},{"id":"28930432","text":"Pervoye Maya () is the name of several inhabited localities in Russia. ;Urban localities *Pervoye Maya, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, a work settlement in Balakhninsky District of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast ;Rural localities *Pervoye Maya, Astrakhan Oblast, a settlement in Privolzhsky District of Astrakhan Oblast *Pervoye Maya, Ivanovo Oblast, a village in the Furmanovsky District of Ivanovo Oblast *Pervoye Maya, name of several other rural localities ","title":"Pervoye Maya, Russia"},{"id":"28930435","text":"Lady Brigid Katharine Rachel Guinness (30 July 19208 March 1995) was the youngest daughter of Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh, and wife of Prince Frederick of Prussia, grandson of Wilhelm II, German Emperor.

The original position of the chate√¢u, on a rock above the Vltava valley, was altered by the creation of the Orl√≠k reservoir in 1954‚Äì62, and the chate√¢u is now barely a few metres above the water level. The meaning of the name Orl√≠k stems from the word \\"young eagle\\" (). It is often suggested that this castle would have resembled an eagle or nest perched upon the rocky outcrop above a turn in the river. History Orl√≠k Chate√¢u before the building of the Orl√≠k Dam. Oil on canvas, by Czech painter Vil√©m Str√∂minger. Orl√≠k was established as a royal castle beside a ford across the River Vltava in the second half of the 13th century, probably by P≈ôemysl Otakar II, although in the Middle Ages it came into the hands of noble families and its ownership changed many times. From 1408 the Zmrzl√≠k of Svoj≈°√≠n family owned it, and during their time the Hussite Captain Jan ≈Ωi≈æka of Trocnov stayed in the castle.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° (2003), The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, pg. 103, Kartografie Praha a.s., In 1508 the castle burned down, and was rebuilt as a Renaissance chate√¢u by the new owners, the Lords of ≈†vamberk. In 1623 the Eggenbergs acquired Orl√≠k, and in 1717 it was inherited by the Schwarzenbergs.David, Petr, Vladim√≠r Soukup, Lubom√≠r ƒåech (2004), Wonders of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, Euromedia Group, pg. 139, At the beginning of the 19th century it became their main residence. In 1802 the chate√¢u was burned out, and during the subsequent repairs a fourth storey was added to the building. The most famous member of the family was Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, who was victorious over Napoleon in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The current Romantic Gothic appearance dates from 1849 to 1860, when partial remodelling in this style was carried out according to plans by Bernard Gruber. The Early Gothic style castle of Orl√≠k was confiscated by the Communist Regime after 1948, but in 1990s was reverted to the Schwarzenbergs. Access to the chate√¢u is by a stone bridge across the moat. Three round towers rise above the main fa√ßade, one of them being the original, built in the 14th century. The passage into the chate√¢u is cut into the rock and leads to a trapezoidal courtyard, with arcades on the ground floor. The oldest building is the former palace, which dates from the 14th century and forms the north side of the courtyard. The interiors are mainly in the Empire style, from the first half of the 19th century. The Loveck√Ω s√°l (Hunter's Hall), with quadripartite ribbed vaulting, is original Gothic, and the chapel, also dating from the Gothic period, has a net vault. From an artistic point of view, the most valuable rooms are the state rooms on the first floor; the Greater and Lesser Knight's Halls; Hunting Hall; Blue and Empire Saloons; Library, and the Gun Corridor. The interiors are furnished in the style of the period and feature the family's collection of art works. Adjoining the chate√¢u is an English-style large park, covering , with native and non-native species of trees and shrubs, and a greenhouse with a collection of fuchsias. The Pseudo-Gothic Schwarzenberg vault is in the western part of the park.

It is native to North America, where it occurs across much of Canada and the northern and western United States. Symphoricarpos albus grows in shady and moist mountain and forest habitat, in woodlands and on floodplains and riverbanks. It can grow in a wide variety of habitat types. It is naturalized in parts of Britain, where it has been planted as an ornamental and a cover for game. Symphoricarpos albus is an erect, deciduous shrub, producing a stiff, branching main stem and often several smaller shoots from a rhizome. It can spread and colonize an area to form a dense thicket. It reaches in maximum height. Leaves are oppositely arranged on the spreading branches. They are generally oval, differing in size and shape, and up to long, or slightly larger on the shoots. The inflorescence is a raceme of up to 16 flowers. Each flower has a small, five-toothed calyx of sepals. The bell-shaped, rounded corolla is about long and bright pink in color. It has pointed lobes at the mouth and the inside is filled with white hairs. The fruit is a fleshy white berry-like drupe about a centimeter wide which contains two seeds. The plant sometimes reproduces via seed but it is primarily vegetative, reproducing by sprouting from its spreading rhizome. Birds disperse the seeds after they eat the fruit. This shrub is an important food source for a number of animals, including bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, and grizzly bears. Livestock such as cattle and sheep readily browse it. Many birds and small mammals use it for food and cover. Pocket gophers dig burrows underneath it during the winter. The fruit and shrub itself are poisonous to humans, causing vomiting. Native Americans used the plant as a medicine and a soap, and sometimes for food, and the wood was good for arrow shafts. In Russia, the berries are crushed in the hands and rubbed about for a soothing folk-remedy hand lotion. This shrub is used for erosion control in riparian areas, and it is planted in ecological restoration projects on disturbed sites such as abandoned mines. Its white fruits and blue-green foliage made it popular as an ornamental plant planted around old houses of the 1890s through the 1920s like with the Vanhoutte Spirea or Bridalwreath. It is still sold by some large diverse conventional nurseries and native plant nurseries, and occasionally found in modern landscapes. It grows in full sun to full light shade and a well-drained soil that is slightly acid to well alkaline, pH range of about 6.0 to 8.5. it is easy to transplant with its fibrous, shallow root system. Good for USDA hardiness zones of 2 to 7. Varieties S. albus var. laevigatus There are two varieties: *S. albus var. albus, native to eastern North America *S. albus var. laevigatus, native to the Pacific coast. It is a larger shrub, up to tall, and with slightly larger fruit. It is treated as a distinct species, Symphoricarpos rivularis, by some botanists.

The title \\"Mangia\\" is an Italian word meaning \\"eat!\\". The North American version is one of the rarest games for the 2600. Gameplay Screenshot The player controls a young boy who must eat plates of pasta placed in front of him by his mother, who will keep feeding him until his stomach explodes on-screen. To prevent this, the player can throw it to a cat, who occasionally appears at the window, and a dog, who walks across the bottom of the screen. However, if the mother sees the pasta being thrown to the cat or dog, she brings three times as much pasta the next time she returns. The joystick is used to control the player: pressing right causes the boy to grab a plate of pasta, pressing left causes him to eat it, and pressing up or down causes him to toss the pasta to the cat (named Frankie in the manual) or the dog (named Sergio) respectively. If the cat and dog are not nearby when the food is thrown to them, the mother returns with extra pasta to \\"punish\\" the player. The fire button is not used. If, instead of eating the pasta or throwing it to the animals, the player is idle, the pasta will accumulate on the table until it breaks, causing the player to lose a turn. Attempting to eat all the pasta without giving any to the cat or dog will cause the boy's stomach to swell, changing colors from blue to yellow to red, before finally exploding in a mass of chunky blue pixels.

Some months later, Quinlan sold The Savoy Hotel to the Saudi prince for ¬£250 million, while retaining the other hotels in the group, subsequently renamed The Maybourne Hotel Group. In 2005, Quinlan Private won the financier the deal of the year award at the Variety Club property awards for the Knightsbridge Estate acquisition. The same year, a group of investors led by Quinlan outbid the Abu Dhabi royal family to acquire a ¬£530 million Knightsbridge estate, including retail, hotels, offices and residential properties. In 2006, it was reported that Quinlan had more than ‚Ç¨5 billion worth of assets under management. Quinlan Private joined up with Chicago property company Golub to set up Quinlan Private Golub, an investment fund targeting eastern Europe. He acquired the Chelsea Harbour Hilton, a landmark hotel frequented by English Premiership football clubs for ¬£53.5m. Quinlan Private purchased the ‚Ç¨300m Diagonal Mar shopping centre in Barcelona in 2006, representing Spain's largest yet single property transaction. That year, Quinlan was investor in another syndicate that bought the Irish Glass Bottle development site in Dublin's Ringsend for ‚Ç¨413 million. Anglo-Irish Bank was the principal lender. As of 2009, the site remained undeveloped and the value was written down to ‚Ç¨60 million. In 2010, Anglo- Irish Bank's loan on the site was transferred to Ireland's National Asset Management Agency.Legal proceedings have been brought against property developer Bernard McNamara In 2007, Quinlan Private acquired Irish hotel chain Jurys Inns for ‚Ç¨1.165 billion. Some months later, Quinlan obtained a ‚Ç¨200 million investment in Jurys from the sovereign wealth fund of Oman, as part of a plan for further international expansion of the chain. The same year the firm acquired the Citigroup headquarters at 25 Canada Square for ¬£1 billion, in a joint venture with PropInvest. In April 2007, Quinlan's investment firm acquired a portfolio of 47 Marriott hotels in the UK for ¬£1.1bn. Also in 2007, Quinlan was a co-investor in the acquisition of the Madrid headquarters building of Banco Santander for ‚Ç¨1.9 billion. In 2008, Quinlan led a consortium that acquired the Bank of Ireland Headquarters in Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, for 180 million euros. In June 2017, it was reported that Quinlan was advising a consortium of European investors on an estimated ‚Ç¨1.3 billion bid to buy the Brussels building that houses the Belgian finance ministry. His firm Quinlan Real Estate is leading the bid, which involves one of the largest property transactions in Europe in recent years. The deal will be the largest in Belgian history and the second largest single-property sale in Europe in recent times after the sale of Coeur D√©fense in Paris. The Finance Tower includes a 10-storey block that was built adjacent to the original 31-storey building and it houses more than 4,500 office workers in more than 2.4 million sq ft of floorspace. In 2017, Quinlan also acted as an advisor for an ‚Ç¨8m deal for the acquisition of the former motor tax office in Dublin. Office agents expect the new block to be of particular interest to UK legal firms planning to relocate to Dublin as a result of Brexit. In 2018, Quinlan‚Äôs wife Siobh√°n emerged as a joint shareholder of a multimillion euro prime site in Ballsbridge that is earmarked to become Facebook‚Äôs international headquarters. The site had been acquired in 2015 for ‚Ç¨67.5 million. Planning permission to build a high-end office block was subsequently secured and the value of the site increased to ‚Ç¨120 million. Quinlan then sold her stake to Los Angeles-based real estate investment group Colony Capital. Business difficulties The financial crisis of 2007-2010 severely impacted Quinlan's liquidity. He has since reduced his debts by ‚Ç¨3 billion. In 2009 Quinlan resigned from Quinlan Private and moved to Switzerland on the advice of KPMG. In April 2011 a receiver was appointed on behalf of the National Assets Management Agency (NAMA) to take charge of a number of properties owned by Quinlan, after he had failed to repay loans to the agency totalling hundreds of millions of Euros.Receiver appointed to Derek Quinlan, Newstalk, 14 April 2011.

The band last consisted of founder, lyricist and frontwoman Irene Jericho, lead guitarist Chris Kackley, rhythm guitarist Jen Tonon, bassist Joe Cariola and percussionist Jay Jericho. The band released one EP and three studio albums.  History  =Formation and Early Works (2005 - 2008)= In November 2005, Irene Jericho, Jay Jericho, BJ Robey and Brett McCoy decided to form a new band after working together in folk rock band Revel Moon. They brought on bassist Joe Cariola to fill out the lineup. The newly formed band started playing bars and Pagan festivals on the East Coast. The band's name, according to the band's website, is a reference to the Cassandra metaphor. The band felt the name would be appropriate due to the politically charged and socially conscious tone of their lyrics. In December 2006, Chris Kackley joined Cassandra Syndrome as lead guitarist after Brett McCoy left the band to pursue other projects. In the same year the band entered the studio for the first time to record its first EP, titled Dissent Into Heresy. The EP was released in May 2007. For the next two years the band toured throughout the Mid-Atlantic states. In January 2008, BJ Robey left the band for personal reasons. The band continued as a four piece. =Of Patriots and Tyrants until split (2008-2014)= In February 2008, Figmental Records signed the band onto their label.

The album was released February 7th, 2009. Dr. T of Sonic Cathedral Webzine described the album as \\"metal, with a first rate female soprano driving the train...a metal based call to arms; a plea to recognize that life is fragile and that the earth that supports it must be nurtured.\\" During the last few months of production on Of Patriots and Tyrants, Katie Doherty joined Cassandra Syndrome as rhythm guitarist.

He describes a journey along a \\"great river\\", but the identity of the river is not known for certain. Life Rosier was born on 1 June 1573 at Winston, Suffolk, the son of James Rosier (d. 1581), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Dorothy Johnson. After his father's death in 1581, he was brought up in Ipswich by Robert Wolfrestone, a relative of his mother's, and then in Sir Philip Parker's household. After graduating BA from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1593 and MA in 1596, he entered the household of Sir Philip Woodhouse at Kimberley Hall in Norfolk where he became a Roman Catholic about 1602 under the influence of Lady Woodhouse, a member of the Catholic Yelverton family.. Rosier was among those who sailed to present-day Maine with Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602.. About that time he met Thomas Arundell, who hoped to establish a colony in America for his fellow Catholics. Arundell joined with Plymouth merchants and perhaps his brother-in-law, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, to set forth an expedition under Captain George Weymouth to explore the Maine coast. The voyage lasted from 5 March to 18 July 1605, with Rosier on board as cape merchant and reporter.; . According to Quinn, there were three versions of Rosier's account of the voyage: a now- lost journal; a manuscript version obtained first by Hakluyt and then by Purchas, who abridged it in Purchas his Pilgrimes in 1624; and yet another manuscript, perhaps edited by Hakluyt, which was published as A True Relation of the most prosperous voyage made this present year by Captaine George Waymouth in the Discovery of the Land of Virginia: where he discovered 60 miles of a most excellent River; together with a most fertile land, (London, 1605).; . The exact location of the \\"excellent river\\" is not specified, possibly because Rosier was being deliberately vague in order to preserve the expedition's knowledge to secure backing for a future expedition. David C. Morey argues that the expedition explored the Penobscot River.David C. Morey, The voyage of Archangell: James Rosier's account of the Weymouth voyage of 1605, \\"a true relation\\", Tilbury House, 2005, p.1 However, it has also been suggested that he travelled up the Saint George River.Handbook of North American Indians, Eastern Algonquian Languages, Government Printing Office, p.71 The native Algonquian vocabulary he records has been identified as Etchemin.Bernard Hoffman, The Historical Ethnography of the Micmac of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, University of California, 1955, p. 66 More recently it has been argued that it is more likely to be Eastern Abenaki. On 30 October 1605 Rosier, acting as Weymouth's agent, witnessed an agreement with Sir John Zouche for a voyage to Virginia, which was abandoned as a result of the revelation of the Gunpowder Plot in November of that year, and the development of other plans for the colonization of Virginia.; . For the next two years Rosier was in the service of Lord Buckhurst. On 7 May 1608 he left for Rome, where he was admitted into the Jesuit English College. The account he gave there of his life omits his involvement in the voyage of 1605. He was ordained on 18 April 1609, taking the name Philip James. He died at Loreto later that year on his way back to England to participate in the Jesuits' English mission. Cape Rosier on the Penobscot River in Brooksville, Maine, is named after James Rosier.

It is the youngest Latvian student fraternity.  Overview  Fraternitas Vanenica is a Latvian all-male, lifelong fraternity. It has two mottos: Veritati, humanitati, virtuti and Tƒìvijai, PienƒÅkumam, Draudzƒ´bai (For fatherland, duty, and friendship). Its colours are green, red and silver. Its name, translated from Latin, means Brotherhood of Vanema. Vanema was an ancient land in Latvia (Kurzeme) in the late Iron Age.  History  = Early years = Fraternitas Vanenica was founded by 18 Latvian students (mostly from Latvian University) who in years of war and after it arrived in Germany as refugees. Fleeing from the second soviet occupation, more than 150 000 Latvians emigrated from Latvia in the years 1941-1945. Most of them spent some time in Germany. Thus many young people wanted to restore their studies in German universities. Fraternitas Vanenica was partly established on the base of Latvian student society in Munchen. Fraternity admitted Latvian students mostly from Munich universities. These years was very active. Despite financial problems and poverty in post-war Germany, Fraternitas Vanenica was able to admit new members and to educate them in the spirit of pre-war Latvian student fraternities. = USA period = In the 1950, most Latvian refugees started moving to United States, Canada and other western countries. Also members of Fraternitas Vanenica moved to USA and on June 21, fraternity restored its work in USA, with headquarters in New York City. Also many members later moved to Venezuela and established there autonomous group of the fraternity. In those years, the fraternity admitted Latvian students from American and Venezuelan universities and colleges. Almost all Latvian student fraternities which renewed their work in exile, experienced the same problems. But despite threats of assimilation and lack of funds, student fraternities was one of the symbols of once independent Latvia. They helped to maintain Latvian language and culture in Latvian exile society and also retained more than 100-year-old traditions of Latvian student fraternities. = Fraternitas Vanenica today = In 1991, with collapse of Soviet Union, Latvia regained its independence. Many Latvian student fraternities restored their work in Latvia as early as 1989. Fraternitas Vanenica was exile organization so it moved to Latvia in 1992 and fully started work on September 24. Soon global centre (presidium) was also moved to Riga. It is registered with University of Latvia, but members ar admitted from all Latvian universities. In 2002 Fraternitas Vanenica bought its own house in Riga, Artilƒìrijas street 54. Today members of Fraternitas Vanenica is mostly economists, financiers, auditors and historians.

Mary Craig Sinclair (1882‚Äì1961) was a writer and the wife of Upton Sinclair. Early life and education She was born Mary Craig Kimbrough in Greenwood, Mississippi on February 12, 1882, the oldest child of Mary Hunter (Southworth) and Allan McCaskill Kimbrough, a judge.Peggy W. Prenshaw, \\"Sinclair, Mary Craig Kimbrough,\\" in James B. Lloyd, ed., Lives of Mississippi Authors, 1817‚Äì1967, University of Mississippi Press, 2009, accessed November 9, 2010 Beginning at age 13, Mary studied at the Mississippi State College for Women (starting with what were essentially high school classes) and graduated from the Gardner School for Young Ladies in New York City in 1900. Her father was a wealthy attorney with banking interests, and a member of one of the oldest elite Mississippi families. Career Kimbrough (called Craig in many accounts) began writing and contributed regularly to newspapers and magazines. On a trip with her mother to a sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, they attended a lecture by Upton Sinclair, who had published The Jungle, where they met him. Kimbrough talked with him about her writing and he began to teach her through their deepening relationship. At the time of the Kimbrough-Sinclair marriage on April 21, 1913, the New York Times reported that Mary Craig Kimbrough was best known in the South for The Romance History of Winnie Davis, her biography of Winnie Davis, the daughter of Jefferson Davis. But in her autobiography, Craig said she never wanted to publish it because she found that \\"emotionalism and sentimentality among Confederate veterans made writing an objective study impossible.\\" As she recalled, her future husband said, \\"Your book is terrible! You can't write. I can't honestly encourage you.\\"Southern Belle, p. 77 According to Craig, at her insistence Upton Sinclair published Sylvia (1913) under his name. Craig said that she wrote the novel about a Southern girl based on her own experiences. In her 1957 memoir, she described how she and her husband had collaborated on the work: > Upton and I struggled through several chapters of Sylvia together, > disagreeing about something on every page. But now and then each of us > admitted that the other had improved something. I was learning fast now that > this novelist was not much of a psychologist. He thought of characters in a > book merely as vehicles for carrying his ideas.Southern Belle, 106-8, 111‚Äì2, > 129‚Äì32, 142; quote 111-2 Once married, she said they collaborated on a sequel, Sylvia's Marriage (1914), which was also published under Upton Sinclair's name, by John C.

There was a triangular pond covering before it reached the south-eastern edge of Scratchface Copse.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1911 This section has largely been built over by planned housing estates constructed from the 1960s onwards, and even the retangular pond has been truncated at its southern end. The brook reappears to the north of Hawksworth Road,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map and forms an important wildlife corridor within the village. The stream continues along the edge of Pondhouse Copse before turning to the east and passing through the southern edge of Burghfield Village, another of Burghfield's population centres. It is culverted beneath two houses and Reading Road and then runs east for a while, skirting south of Burghfield Manor and St.Marys Church. The main section of the church building was constructed in Romanesque style by J.B. Lacey in 1843, but when Bodley and Garner added a chancel in 1892, they built it in Decorated style.

In this capacity he managed relations within the English legal profession and its relations internationally, as well as establishing the Senate of the Four Inns of Court that handles disciplinary action and organising the 750th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta and establishing a permanent memorial at the site. He also wrote Conduct and Etiquette at the Bar, which was the standard guide to the decisions of the General Council of the Bar for 25 years. Life Boulton was born in 1912 at Braxted Park in Essex to the politician Sir William Boulton, 1st Baronet, and attended Eton College before joining Trinity College, Cambridge. His academic record was not distinguished, but he was able to enter the Inner Temple in 1936 as a practising barrister. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Boulton, who was already with the Essex Yeomanry, joined the Royal Horse Artillery and served in North Africa. In 1940 he took part in Operation Compass, fighting at the Battle of Bardia and then the Siege of Tobruk, where he contracted jaundice and was evacuated to Alexandria. He returned to frontline service soon afterwards but was badly wounded in a land mine explosion. He spent much of the rest of the war recovering in Cairo, where he met his future wife Margaret Elizabeth Hunter. After the war he left the army as a lieutenant colonel and was employed with the Allied Control Council, helping to re-establish the German legal profession while excluding those members with Nazi sympathies. He returned to Britain in 1950 and became Secretary of the Bar Council. This position entailed a wide range of legal and diplomatic responsibilities including the organisation of law reform, managing relations with the Law Society and with foreign legal representatives, organising legal aid and even planning the 750th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta, establishing the first permanent memorial on the site. One of his most important roles was as author in 1953 of the standard guide to the decisions of the General Council of the Bar, named Conduct and Etiquette at the Bar, which was presented to every newly qualified barrister until well into the 1980s. Shortly before his retirement in 1975, Boulton was heavily involved in the establishment of the Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar, which handles internal disciplinary matters. In the Queen's Birthday Honours 1958, Boulton was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). On his retirement, Boulton was knighted in the 1975 New Year Honours. He later inherited the Boulton Baronetcy, of Braxted Park, on the death of his elder brother in 1983. He died in 2010, survived by his wife, two daughters and son who inherited the baronetcy.

The park is and sits at an elevation of . The park is open for year-round recreation including fishing, camping, and non- powered boating. Dead Timber State Recreation Area is north of Scribner on U.S. Route 275. Dead Timber State Recreation Area was the site of a seasonal Indian encampment. Local legend holds that the area acquired its name after an Indian campfire got out of control and burned much of the standing timber in the area, hence the name Dead Timber. The park is located between the Elkhorn River and an oxbow lake that was once part of the nearby meandering river. The natives camped near the river in the summer months before retreating behind the river bluffs and settling on the oxbow. An oxbow lake is formed when a river creates a meander due to the river eroding the banks through hydraulic action and abrasion/corrasion. After a long period of time this meander becomes very curved, and eventually the neck of the meander will touch the opposite side and the river will cut through the neck, cutting off the meander to form the oxbow lake. The park lies within Dodge County which was settled by European Americans in 1856. The whites displaced the Pawnee among other Native American tribes. The winter of 1856 was an especially hard winter. The newly arrived whites felt threatened by their Indian neighbors who camped near their settlements. The Pawnee sent a party to the town of Fremont to threaten war. The conflict was resolved when the whites agreed to provide food for the natives. The Pawnee were removed to a reservation by 1859. Dead Timber State Recreation Area is a small and largely undeveloped state park. Recreation is limited to camping, fishing, boating and picnicking. All boats must be human- powered as all motorized boats are not permitted in the park. Primitive restroom facilities are located within the park. There are 17 camping pads with electricity and 25 pads without electricity. Fishing is permitted in the oxbow lake. Budget cuts brought on by the nationwide recession has caused the state of Nebraska to dramatically limit the services it provides at Dead Timbers State Recreation Area and many other Nebraska state parks. Local citizens have seen the need to help care for the parks themselves and they have been volunteering to carry on chores normally handled by the state such as mowing grass, serving as camp hosts, and pulling other maintenance on the park's facilities.

The original album covers are displayed side by side on the front of these CD reissues, and it is clear that the color of the Born Free cover has been enhanced considerably for the Collectables release, as Williams's suntanned face from the original LP cover shown on the Sony release now has a more psychedelic orange glow. The Collectables CD was included in a box set entitled Classic Album Collection, Vol. 1, which contains 17 of his studio albums and three compilations and was released on June 26, 2001. Reception William Ruhlmann of Allmusic remarked that this album \\"marked a notable contemporization of the Williams formula. On his most recent albums, The Shadow of Your Smile and In the Arms of Love, he had leaned toward Brazilian sounds, recording more obscure material and several standards from the interwar period.\\" He also explained why the change may have happened: \\"In the Arms of Love, released only four months before Born Free, had sold disappointingly. Williams reacted by dropping the bossa nova and the oldies and looked more to the recent pop charts for covers like Bobby Hebb's 'Sunny.'\\" Ruhlmann suggested that Williams was trying to reach as wide of an audience as possible. \\"At a time when non-rock pop singers were beginning to be marginalized, Williams successfully threaded the needle, reassuring his older listeners while proving adaptable to current trends.\\" Track listing =Side one= # \\"Born Free\\" from Born Free (Don Black, John Barry) ‚Äì 2:27 # \\"Somewhere My Love\\" (Paul Francis Webster, Maurice Jarre) ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"Spanish Eyes\\" (Charlie Singleton, Eddie Snyder, Bert Kaempfert) ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"Strangers in the Night\\" (Charlie Singleton, Eddie Snyder, Bert Kaempfert) ‚Äì 2:32 # \\"Sherry!\\" from Sherry!

He competed on the nascent professional tennis tours (Grand Prix tour and World Championship Tennis) as well as in Davis Cup for Canada. Early tennis Bardsley went to California to pursue tennis, attending Diablo Valley College in 1963 and 1964. He returned to Vancouver to attend the University of British Columbia in 1965 and by 1967 he was British Columbia's top-ranked player. The following year he became the No. 2 ranked player in Canada as he finished runner-up at the Canadian Closed championship. He remained a top four ranked Canadian singles player through to 1975. Tour play From 1969 through 1975, Bardsley competed in 16 tennis tour main draws in singles and 18 in doubles. He did not fare well, winning only 2 singles matches and 6 in doubles. In 1969, he lost in the first round in Cincinnati in singles to Jun Kuki 1-6, 3-6 and in doubles playing with fellow Davis Cup player Don McCormick. The following month at the Canadian Open, he was eliminated by compatriot Harry Fauquier in straight sets while in doubles he and McCormick reached the second round. Bardsley next competed in a tour main draw at the 1971 Canadian Open, where in singles, after a first round bye, he lost to tennis legend John Newcombe, 3-6, 4-6. In doubles, he and McCormick lost their opening match. His next event was the 1972 Canadian Open where again after a first round bye he went out in the round of 32, this time to Terry Ryan, 5-7, 4-6. In doubles, this time playing with a different Canadian, Ken Binns, Bardsley reached the second round by defeating the Australian duo of John Cooper and Colin Dibley. Later that autumn, Bardsley also participated in the tour WCT Vancouver event. There he lost in the first round to Fred Stolle by the respectable score of 5-7, 6-7. In doubles, he and McCormick lost in the first round. Bardsley competed in three singles main draws in 1973 and five doubles draws. He won his first singles tour match in defeating Mike Estep at the Calgary Indoor, 7-6, 7-6. He lost in the next round to the iconic Ion ≈¢iriac, 5-7, 6-7. The Vancouver WCT, moved to April, was where Bardsley saw his next tour main draw action. He lost in the first round in singles to Tom Gorman, 2-6, 4-6, while in doubles he and partner Bob Carmichael also fell at the first hurdle. In August at the Canadian Open, he lost in the first round, again, this time to John Alexander, 4-6, 6-7. He lost his first match in doubles too, partnering Canadian Keith Carpenter. He played in two further tournaments in the autumn in doubles. At the Seattle Grand Prix, he and William Brown reached the second round while at the Quebec Grand Prix, Bardsley and partner C. Burr lost in the first. In the last computer rankings released for the year, in December, Bardsley was listed as World No. 213. For 1974, Bardsley appeared in more singles main draws than doubles, six and five. At the WCT Toronto in February, he lost in singles to Patrick Poisy, 1-6, 2-6, while in doubles he and partner Carpenter reached the second round. At the Salisbury Grand Prix (in Maryland), after a first round bye, Bardsley lost to another tennis icon, Jimmy Connors, 1-6, 2-6. In doubles, Tony reached the second round again, partnering Lars Elvstr√∏m. The following month at Calgary, he lost to Ian Crookenden 2-6, 6-7, while in doubles he and Elvstr√∏m lost in the first round. The duo did likewise the following week at the Jackson Grand Prix (in Jackson, Mississippi) while in singles, Bardsley was knocked out by Kim Warwick, 3-6, 5-7. His next play occurred in June at a Wimbledon Championships tune-up event, Beckenham, where Bardsley defeated Colin Dowdeswell 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 before falling to Syd Ball, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6. His July, 1974 (singles) ranking ended up being his career best, world No. 207. (Doubles rankings were kept until after Bardsley left the tour.) His final event for the year was the Canadian Open where Bardsley went out in the first round to yet another legend to be, Bj√∂rn Borg, 3-6, 1-6. In doubles, he and Don McCormick lost in the first round. His finished the year ranked World No. 228. In his final year on the tour, Bardsley appeared in the main draw of three events. At the Toronto Indoor WCT in February, he lost his opening singles match to Grover Raz Reid, 2-6, 3-6, while in doubles he and McCormick went out again in the first round. Bardsley next played outside of North America for the first time, at the Swedish Open, where he competed in the main draw just in doubles. He and partner Mike Power lost however in the first round. Bardsley's last tour main draw appearance was at the 1975 Canadian Open. He lost in singles to Paul Kronk, 4-6, 2-6, while in doubles he and partner David Brown reached the second round. He finished the year ranked World No. 308. Davis Cup Bardsley played in seven Davis Cup ties for Canada and had a match win-loss record of 7 and 8, 4 and 6 in singles and 3 and 2 in doubles. In 1972, in the North and Central America Group semi-finals, he lost both of his singles rubbers in straight sets, to Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez in Round 2 and Joaquin Loyo-Mayo in Round 4, as Canada lost the tie to Mexico 2-3. The following year in the group quarter-finals, Canada fell to Colombia in Bogot√°, 1-4. Canada No. 1 Mike Belkin was forced to retire in the opening rubber. Bardsley then was defeated in Round 2 to Jairo Velasco, despite taking the opening set. Colombia won the encounter with Velasco and Iv√°n Molina easily taking the doubles tie over Bardsley and his oft partner Don McCormick, 3-6, 4-6, 3-6. Bardsley did take Canada's only rubber for the tie, defeating Javier Restrepo, 8-6, 7-5, 6-1. The loss meant Canada had to play the Caribbean/West Indies Davis Cup team, a contest that they won. Bardsley won the opening rubber handily, 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 over Leo Rolle, and the doubles match partnering McCormick, also in straight sets. The following month, Canada faced Mexico again in the group semi-final, this time in Mexico City. Once again they lost, this time 1 won rubber to 4. Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez easily beat Bardsley 1-6, 3-6, 2-6 in Round 2 and he and McCormick came back from two sets down to level their tie before losing the fifth, 5-7. A year later in October, 1974, Canada and Mexico once again faced each other in the North and Central America group semi-final, and again the Mexicans prevailed 4-1. McCormick lost the first match and Bardsley the second, 2-6, 2-6, 2-6 to Loyo-Mayo. Pierre Lamarche and R√©jean G√©nois contested the doubles rubber this time, and were soundly beaten, 1-6, 0-6, 2-6 to Ram√≠rez and Vicente Zarazua. Bardsley's last Davis Cup action came the following year, 1975. Canada opened America Group play defeating Colombia 5-0 at Rockland Tennis Club in Montreal. Bardsley opened the tie defeating Orlando Agudelo 6-0, 6-3, 6-2. In doubles, Bardsley and G√©nois beat Agudelo and √Ålvaro Betancur also in straight sets. Then in a dead rubber Bardsley beat Javier Restrepo, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. Once again Canada faced Mexico, this time in the group quarter-finals. Bardsley played just the doubles rubber - he and G√©nois won the first and fourth sets before losing the fifth 4-6. Canada yet again fell to Mexico, for the ninth straight time since 1952, this time by the score of 2 matches to 3. Post-tour tennis In the last five years of his competitive career, Bardsley focused on tournaments in the Pacific Northwest, earning the #1 ranking in the region in 1977. His last year of competitive tennis was 1981, when he won the BC Nike Grand Prix tennis circuit and earned the #1 ranking in British Columbia. Bardsley later served as head tennis professional at Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club from 1978 until 1990 and volunteer director of tournament operations for the ITF Federation Cup held in West Vancouver in 1987. He also volunteered many hours on Tennis BC's board of directors in charge of coaching certification, all the time working for the improvement of tennis in his native province. Personal Bardsley was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.

Fundamentally, words that specify a spatio-temporal demarcation of their reference are considered bounded, while words that allow for a fluidly interpretable referent are considered unbounded. This distinction also relies on the divisibility of the lexical item's referent into distinct segments, or strata. Though this feature most often distinguishes countability in nouns and aspect in verbs, it applies more generally to any syntactic category. Boundedness in verbs For verbs, certain grammatical aspects express boundedness. Boundedness is characteristic of perfective aspects such as the Ancient Greek aorist and the Spanish preterite. The simple past of English commonly expresses a bounded event (\\"I found out\\"), but sometimes expresses, for example, a stative (\\"I knew\\"). The perfective aspect often includes a contextual variation similar to an inchoative aspect or verb, and expresses the beginning of a state. Boundedness in nouns In order for a noun to be semantically bounded, its referent item, whether tangible or abstract, must have clearly defined limits on the extent and content of what it encompasses. Structurally, bounded and unbounded nouns correlate to a number of descriptive criteria. The first criterion is internal homogeneity; while the referent of bounded nouns can be composed of distinct segments, an unbounded noun typically refers to something which is considered a cohesive expanse. The next criteria are the interrelated concepts of expansibility and replicability. Because unbounded nouns refer to internally homogenous referents, any part of their expansive referent could be analyzed as an instance of that noun. Further, any removal of the expanse does not change the applicability of the noun to its referent. These two qualities are not possible of bounded nouns. Note that boundedness in nouns should not be thought of as synonymous with countability. Rather, boundedness is an underlying semantic distinction that motivates countability.

During the Swedish siege of Akershus Fortress in Oslo in 1716, Charles XII of Sweden sent 600 soldiers under Axel L√∂wen to investigate whether they could surround the Norwegian defences. The Swedish troops had taken shelter in and by the old Norderhov Rectory (Norderhov presteg√•rd). Anna Colbj√∏rnsdatter received them friendly and kept them busy while she sent her son-in-law with a message to a nearby camp with 200 Norwegian soldiers. The Swedish force was taken by surprise and 130 of them captured. Reportedly she alerted the Norwegians to the presence of the troops of Charles XII of Sweden in the church yard at Norderhov, where they had taken shelter in and around the rectory.

He subsequently became chief executive, and then chairman, of Reckitt & Colman. Active from that period in the Confederation of British Industry, he became its president in 1984. Cleminson was born in 1921 in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, to businessman Arnold Cleminson and his wife, Dr. Florence Stacey-Cleminson, a physician at Victoria Children‚Äôs Hospital. Clemison attended Rugby School and was called up for war service in 1940 immediately after leaving. He fought in the North African Campaign and was captured, being taken to Italy as a prisoner of war. There he escaped and walked through enemy lines to rejoin his regiment during the Italian Campaign. He subsequently joined the Parachute Regiment as a captain and participated in the Battle of Arnhem, where his platoon ambushed and killed the German garrison commander Major-General Friedrich Kussin. During the fighting, Cleminson found himself trapped in an attic with Major-General Roy Urquhart, who took exception to Cleminson's mustache, which he called \\"damned silly\\". For three days he fought in the village of Oosterbeek, until he was wounded and captured. For his defense of the perimeter, Cleminson was awarded the Military Cross and was later featured in the film A Bridge Too Far, played by Michael Graham Cox. In early 1945, Cleminson was freed by American forces, and accompanied Urquhart to Norway at the end of the conflict. On demobilisation in 1946, Cleminson joined his father's firm, which had merged with J. J. Colman to form Reckitt & Colman. The company produced a wide array of household goods. Cleminson rose rapidly in the food division, known as Colman's, and then was appointed to the board of Reckitt & Colman, where from 1973 he was chief executive and from 1976 chairman. In 1980 he also took a position with the Confederation of British Industry, which was suffering severely due to the effects of the 1973‚Äì75 recession. He remained there until 1986, spending the last two years as president, before retiring from both positions to become chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board. In retirement, Cleminson held a number of chairman and board positions and was particularly active in Norfolk, where he was instrumental in the revitalization of the Theatre Royal, Norwich. For his services to business, Cleminson was knighted in 1982 and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. Cleminson was also a keen sportsman throughout his life and on his death in September 2010 was survived by his wife Judy and three children. He is buried in the graveyard of Barsham Church in Suffolk.

Introduction Theravada Buddhist cosmology describes the 31 planes of existence in which rebirth takes place. The order of the planes are found in various discourses of Gautama Buddha in the Sutta Pitaka. For example, in the Saleyyaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha mentioned the planes above the human plane in ascending order.Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1186. In several suttas in the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha described the causes of rebirth in these planes in the same order. In Buddhism, the devas are not immortal gods that play a creative role in the cosmic process. They are simply elevated beings who had been reborn in the celestial planes as a result of their words, thoughts, and actions. Usually, they are just as much in bondage to delusion and desire as human beings, and as in need of guidance from the Enlightened One. The Buddha is the \\"teacher of devas and humans (satthadevamanussanam). The devas came to visit the Buddha in the night. The Devatasamyutta and the Devaputtasamyutta of the Samyutta Nikaya gives a record of their conversations. The devaputtas are young devas newly arisen in heavenly planes, and devatas are mature deities.Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. . The data for the 31 planes of existence in samsara are compiled from the Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, Samyutta Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, Khuddaka Nikaya, and others. The 31 planes of existence can be perceived by a Buddha's Divine eye (dibbacakkhu) and some of his awakened disciples through the development of jhana meditation. According to the suttas, a Buddha can access all these planes and know all his past lives as well as those of other beings. In the Maha-Saccaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya of the Pali Canon, Gautama Buddha said: > When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of > defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I > directed it to the knowledge of the passing away & reappearance of beings. I > saw ‚Äî by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human ‚Äî beings > passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & > superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their > kamma: 'These beings ‚Äî who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, & > mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions > under the influence of wrong views ‚Äî with the break-up of the body, after > death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, > the lower realms, in hell. But these beings ‚Äî who were endowed with good > conduct of body, speech & mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held > right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views ‚Äî with > the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good > destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus ‚Äî by means of the divine eye, > purified & surpassing the human ‚Äî I saw beings passing away & re-appearing, > and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, > fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The > Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1070. In the Itivuttaka edition of the Khuddaka Nikaya and in the MƒÅpu√±√±abhƒÅyi Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha told about his past lives: > Whenever the eon contracted I reached the \\"Plane of Streaming Radiance\\", and > when the eon expanded I arose in an empty divine mansion. And there I was > Brahma, the great Brahma, the unvanquished victor, the all-seeing, the all- > powerful. Thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the devas. And many > hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch, righteous, a king of > righteousness, conqueror of the four regions of the earth, maintaining > stability in the land, in possession of the seven treasures.Bhikkhu Bodhi, > In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 588.MƒÅpu√±√±abhƒÅyi > Sutta, A·πÖgutarra Nikaya 7.59: Pali Text Society, A iv 88-89 =Causes for rebirth in various planes= The process by which sentient beings migrate from one state of existence to another is dependent on causes and conditions. The three causes are giving or charity, moral conduct, meditative development, and their opposites. Rebirth in the Kama-loka depends on a person's moral conduct and practice of giving. Rebirth in the Rupa-loka and Arupa-loka also requires meditation development. Liberation from all rebirth requires wisdom in addition to moral conduct and meditation. About the cycle of rebirth, Bhikkhu Bodhi, a scholar monk who has translated numerous texts from the Pali Canon, writes that beyond all planes of existence is the unconditioned Nibbana, the final goal of the Buddha's teaching: > A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the > Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary way station. The > ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, > no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering. > According to the Buddha's teaching, all states of existence within the round > of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with > pain. Thus, the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, > which means total release from the round of rebirth and death.Bodhi, Bhikkhu > (ed.) (2005). In The Words of the Buddha: An Anthology of Discourses from > the Pali Canon. Boston: Wisdom Publications. . =Liberation from rebirth= Liberation from the rounds of rebirth requires more than just meditation achievement. It is necessary to apply Yoniso Manasikara after emerging from Samma Samadhi (1st to 4th jhana) in order to arrive at a breakthrough by wisdom. The Udana shows that after emerging from the jhanas, the Buddha directed his attention to the cause of dukkha and the way leading to its cessation. This process culminates in the discovery of Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (dependent origination) and the Four Noble Truths. > When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted One arose from the > state of trance and in the first watch of the night, thoroughly thought out > the chain of cause and effect, in direct order, thus; \\"If there is this > (state), another (state) arises, by the arising of this (state), a (state) > is produced, that is to say: \\"From Ignorance spring Fabrications, from > Fabrications springs Consciousness, from Consciousness spring Mind and > Material Form, from Mind and Material Form, the six Organs of Sense, from > the six Organs of Sense, Contact, from Contact, Sensations, from Sensations, > Desire, from Desire, Attachment, from Attachment, Becoming, from Becoming, > Birth, from Birth spring Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and > Despair.

The 31 Planes of Existence = Arupa-Loka (Formless Realms) = The immaterial or formless realm (arupa loka) includes four planes into which beings are born as a result of attaining the Four Formless Jhana ar≈´padhyƒÅnas. The inhabitants of these realms are possessed entirely of mind. Having no physical form or location, they are unable to hear Dhamma teachings. They achieve this by attaining the formless jhana levels in a previous life, and now enjoy the fruits (vipƒÅka) of the good karma of that accomplishment for a period before rebirth in a lower plane again. They do not interact with the rest of the universe. * 31 - Realm of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception (nevasannanasannayatanupaga deva): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the fourth formless jhana in a previous life. The beings in this plane only have mind and no physical body. They are unable to hear Dhamma. In this sphere the formless beings do not engage in \\"perception\\". Uddaka RƒÅmaputta reached this plane and thought that this is awakening. After having experienced this state the Buddha realized that it will eventually lead to further rebirth.Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 801. * 30 - Realm of Nothingness (akincannayatanupaga deva): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the third formless jhana in a previous life. This is considered a form of perception, though a very subtle one. This was the sphere reached by ƒÄ·∏∑ƒÅra KƒÅlƒÅma, the Buddha's first teacher. Alara Kalama thought that it is the state of awakening or liberation.Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 796. * 29 - The Realm of Infinite Consciousness (vinnanancayatanupaga deva): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the second formless jhana. In this sphere formless beings dwell meditating on their consciousness (vij√±ƒÅna) as infinitely pervasive. * 28 - Realm of Infinite Space (akasanancayatanupaga deva): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the first formless jhana. = Rupa-Loka (Fine-Material World) = The fine material realm (rupa- loka) consists of sixteen planes. Beings are reborn into these planes as a result of attaining the form jhanas. The prevalent mode of experience here is meditative rather than sensory. They have bodies made of fine matter. The sixteen planes correspond to the attainment of the four form jhanas. The devas of the rupa-loka have physical forms, but are sexless and passionless. Beings in the lower planes are not able to see beings in planes higher than theirs. The beings of the Form realm are not subject to the extremes of pleasure and pain, or governed by desires for things pleasing to the senses, as the beings of the KƒÅma-loka are. The bodies of Form realm beings do not have sexual distinctions. Like the beings of the Arupa-loka, the dwellers in the Rupa-loka have minds corresponding to the dhyƒÅnas (PƒÅli: jhƒÅnas). In their case it is the four lower jhanas or r≈´padhyƒÅnas. Related Sutta : Jhana Sutta from the Anguttara Nikaya  Pure Abodes (Suddhavasa)  The Pure Abodes are distinct from the other worlds of the rupa-loka in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments. Birth in these five realms are a result of attaining the fruit of non-returning or Anagami, the third level of enlightenment. These Pure Abodes are accessible only to those who have destroyed the lower five fetters, consisting of self-view, sceptical doubt, clinging to rites and ceremonies, sense desires, and ill-will.Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), pp. 31, 95, entries for \\"AnƒÅgƒÅmin\\" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi- bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:735.pali) and \\"ƒÄgƒÅmin\\" (at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2587.pali). They will destroy their remaining fetters of craving for fine material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness and ignorance during their existence in the Pure Abodes. Those who take rebirth here are called \\"non-returners\\" because they do not return from that world, but attain final nibbana there without coming back. They guard and protect Buddhism on earth, and will pass into enlightenment as Arhats when they pass away from the Suddhavasa worlds. According to the Ayacana Sutta, among its inhabitants is Brahma Sahampati, who begs the Buddha to teach Dhamma to the world. The five Pure Abodes are: * 27 - Peerless Devas (Akanittha deva): World of devas \\"un-equal in rank\\". The highest of all the R≈´padhƒÅtu worlds, it is often used to refer to the highest extreme of the universe. The current ≈öakra will eventually be born there. * 26 - Clear-Sighted Devas (Sudassi deva): The \\"clear-seeing\\" devas live in a world similar to and friendly with the world. * 25 - Beautiful Devas (Sudassa deva): The world of the \\"beautiful\\" devas is said to be the place of rebirth for five kinds of anƒÅgƒÅmins. * 24 - Untroubled Devas (Atappa deva): The world of the \\"untroubled\\" devas, for whose company those of lower realms long. * 23 - Devas not Falling Away (Aviha deva): The world of the \\"not falling\\" devas, perhaps the most common destination for reborn AnƒÅgƒÅmins. Many achieve arhatship directly in this world, but some pass away and are reborn in sequentially higher worlds of the Pure Abodes until they are at last reborn in the world. These are called in PƒÅli , \\"those whose stream goes upward\\".  B·πõhatphala Planes  These two realms are a result of attaining the fourth jhana. They remain in the tranquil state attained in the 4th Jhana, and is characterized by equanimity (). * 22 - Unconscious beings (Asa√±√±asatta): Realm of mindless beings who have only bodies without consciousness. Rebirth into this plane results from a meditative practice aimed at the suppression of consciousness. Those who take up this practice assume release from suffering can be achieved by attaining unconsciousness. However, when the life span in this realm ends, the beings pass away and are born in other planes where consciousness returns. * 21 - Very Fruitful devas (vehapphala deva): In the Jhana Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha said \\"The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life-span of 500 eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades.\\"Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.)

Planes  These three realms are a result of attaining the third jhana. The mental state of the devas of these worlds corresponds to the third jhana, and is characterized by a quiet joy (sukha). These devas have bodies that radiate a steady light. * 20 - Devas of Refulgent Glory (subhakinna deva): The Buddha said, \\"The Subhakinha devas, monks, have a life-span of 64 mahakalpas. A run- of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades.\\"Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.)

Retrieved 2010-09-23 from \\"Access to Insight\\" at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html. * 19 - Devas of Unbounded Glory (appamanasubha deva): The world of devas of \\"limitless beauty\\". * 18 - Devas of Limited Glory (parittasubha deva): The world of devas of \\"limited beauty\\".  ƒÄbhƒÅsvara Planes  These three are a result of attaining the second jhana. The mental state of the devas of the ƒÄbhƒÅsvara worlds corresponds to the second dhyƒÅna, and is characterized by delight (prƒ´ti) as well as joy (sukha). * 17 - Devas of Streaming Radiance (abhassara deva): The Abhassara devas have a life-span of 8 mahakalpas. After that period they are reborn in a lower realm.Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)\\" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from \\"Access to Insight\\" at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html. * 16 - Devas of Unbounded Radiance (appamanabha deva): The world of devas of \\"limitless light\\", a concept on which they meditate. Their lifespan is 4 mahƒÅkalpas. * 15 - Devas of Limited Radiance (parittabha deva): The world of devas of \\"limited light\\". Their lifespan is 2 mahƒÅkalpas.  BrahmƒÅ Planes  The mental state of the devas of the BrahmƒÅ worlds corresponds to the first jhana. Like all beings, the brahmas are still tied to the cycle of rebirth, though sometimes they forget this and imagine themselves to be immortal. The Buddha said \\"The devas of Brahma's retinue, monks, have a life- span of an eon. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades.\\"Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.)

One way to rebirth in the brahma world is mastery over the first jhana. Another is through meditations on loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. According to the Subha Sutta, the Brahmin Subha asked the Buddha to teach him how to be born in the world of Brahma. And the Buddha said to him: > Then young man, listen carefully I will tell.‚Äô The young man agreed and the > Blessed One said. The bhikkhu pervades one direction with thoughts of loving > kindness, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in > every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, he pervades with the > thought of loving kindness grown great and immeasurable without anger and > ill will.

Just as a clever > drummer in no time would make known the message in the four directions. In > the same manner, when the release of the mind in loving kindness, is > developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method to > be born with Brahma.

(1995, > ed. Bhikkhu Bodhi). The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New > Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. . * 14 - Great Brahmas (Maha brahma): One of this realm's most famous inhabitants is the Great Brahma, a deity whose delusion leads him to regard himself as the all-powerful, all-seeing creator of the Universe. According to the BrahmajƒÅla Sutta, a MahƒÅ brahmƒÅ is a being from the ƒÄbhƒÅsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause. Related Sutta: Kevaddha Sutta * 13 - Ministers of Brahma (brahma-purohita deva): The \\"Ministers of BrahmƒÅ\\" are beings, also originally from the ƒÄbhƒÅsvara worlds, that are born as companions to MahƒÅbrahmƒÅ after he has spent some time alone. Since they arise after his thought of a desire for companions, he believes himself to be their creator, and they likewise believe him to be their creator and lord. * 12 - Retinue of Brahma (brahma-parisajja deva): The \\"Councilors of BrahmƒÅ\\" or the devas \\"belonging to the assembly of BrahmƒÅ\\". = Kama-Loka (The Sense-Sphere realm) = Birth into these heavenly planes takes place as a result of giving and moral discipline. The Sense-Sphere Realm is the lowest of the three realms. The driving force within this realm is sensual desire. These devas enjoy aesthetic pleasures, long life, beauty, and certain powers. The heavenly planes are not reserved only for good Buddhists. Anyone who has led a wholesome life can be born in them. People who believe in an \\"eternal heaven\\" may carry their belief to the deva plane and take the long life span there to be an eternal existence. Only those who have known the Dhamma will realize that, as these planes are impermanent, some day these sentient beings will fall away from them and be reborn elsewhere. The devas can help people by inclining their minds to wholesome acts, and people can help the devas by inviting them to rejoice in their meritorious deeds. Related Suttas: Saleyyaka Sutta, Dana Sutta  Higher Kama (Karma) Loka  These devas live in four heavens that float in the air, leaving them free from contact with the strife of the lower world. * 11 - Devas Wielding Power over the Creation of Others (Parinimmita-vasavattin deva): These devas enjoy sensual pleasures created by others for them. These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor. Mara, the personification of delusion and desire, lives here. * 10 - Devas Delighting in Creation (Nimmanarati deva): These devas delight in the sense objects of their own creation. They are capable of changing appearance to please themselves. The lord of this world is Sunirmita (PƒÅli Sunimmita). * 9 - Contented deva (Tusita deva): Tushita is the home of the contented gods, among whom many Bodhisattvas, including the future Buddha Maitreya, abide. Before his birth as Siddhartha, the present Buddha also used to dwell with the other Bodhisattvas in this realm. His name in this realm was ≈övetaketu (PƒÅli: Setaketu). While Maitreya is undoubtedly the most important of the dwellers in , the ruler of this world is (PƒÅli: Santusita). * 8 - Yama devas: These Yama devas live in the air, free of all difficulties.  Lower Kama-Loka  The lower devas of the Kama-loka live on different parts of the mountain at the center of the world, Sumeru. They are even more passionate than the higher devas, and do not simply enjoy themselves but also engage in strife and fighting. * 7 - Thirty-three gods (Tavatimsa deva): Beings that live on the peak of Sumeru are like the Olympian gods. Their ruler is Sakka or ≈öakra, a devotee of the Buddha. Sakka rules by righteousness, patience towards aggressors, and compassionate treatment of wrongdoers. Sakka and the devas honor sages and holy men. He earned his place as ruler of the devas by fulfilling seven vows which embody the standards of the virtuous householder while he was still a human being. The Buddha holds up Sakka's patience and forgiveness as a model for the bhikkhus. Many devas dwelling here live in mansions in the air. Besides the thirty-three devas, many other devas and supernatural beings dwell here, including the attendants of the devas and many apsarases (nymphs). Related Suttas: Sakka-panha Sutta and the Sakka Samyutta (11th section of the Samyutta Nikaya) which also contains 25 short discourses connected with Sakka. * 6 - Four Great Kings (catummaharajika deva): The world of the Four Great Kings includes the martial kings who guard the four quarters of the Earth. The chief of these kings is Vaisravana, but all are ultimately accountable to Sakra. Dhatarattha, king of the Eastern Direction, is lord of the gandhabbas. Virulha, king of the Southern Direction, is lord of the kumbandas. Virupakkha, king of the Western Direction, is lord of the nagas. Kuvera, who rules as king of the Northern Direction, is lord of the yakkhas. The devas who guide the Sun and Moon are also part of this world. This is home to the four types of earthly demigod or nature-spirit: Gandhabba - the celestial musicians or fairies Yakkha - tree spirits of varying degrees of ethical purity. They are analogous to the goblins, trolls, ogres, and fairies of Western fairy tales. They inhabit remote areas such as forests, hills, and abandoned caves. Though living in misery they have the potential for awakening and can attain the path and fruits of the spiritual life. Related Suttas: Yakkhasayutta of the Samyutta Nikaya. According to the Atanatiya Sutta: > \\"There are non-humans who are fierce, violent, given to retaliation; those > non-humans heed neither the (four) great kings, nor their ministers nor > their attendants. They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. > Even as in the kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of > Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels > against the king of Magadha, so there are non-humans who are fierce... (as > before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings.\\" Kumbhanda (dwarfs) Naga (dragons) Related Sutta: Maha-samya Sutta of the Digha Nikaya probably also Garuda = Human Beings (manussa loka) = * 5 - Human (manussa loka): Birth in this plane results from giving and moral discipline of middling quality. This is the realm of moral choice where destiny can be guided. The Khana Sutta mentioned that this plane is a unique balance of pleasure and pain. It facilitates the development of virtue and wisdom to liberate oneself from the entire cycle or rebirths. For this reason rebirth as a human being is considered precious according to the Chiggala Sutta. In the Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta (The Shorter Analysis of Action), the Buddha taught that: Killing others lead to short life if one becomes reborn in the human plane instead of the four lower States of Deprivation. By abandoning the very acts of killing and harming, one gets to be reborn in a heavenly world. Alternatively, one gets to be reborn in the human world being endowed with long life. Injuring of others beings can lead to rebirth in the States of Deprivation. Alternatively, the person comes back in the human plane as someone very sickly. Non-injuring of others leads to rebirth in good destinations. Alternatively, one comes back to the human plane enjoying good health. The same goes for the following: * Beautiful or Unattractive Human Rebirth depends on whether the person has an irritable character in this life. * Influential or Ordinary Human Rebirth depends on whether the person is envious of the gain and honor received by others in this life. * Rich or Poor Human Rebirth depends on whether one is generous to others, such as providing the requisites of holy people, in this present life. Related Suttas: Janussonin Sutta, Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta, = States of Deprivation (Apaya) = Rebirth into these planes results from unwholesome conduct. Beings reborn there have no moral sense and generally cannot create good kamma (karma). However, when the unwholesome kamma that brought them to these planes is exhausted, some stored good kamma can bring them rebirth in some other plane. Only stream-enterers and other ariyans can be sure they will never again be born in these planes of misery. Related sutta: Saleyyaka Sutta and The Vipaka Sutta * 4 - Asura: They are demons or \\"titans\\" that are engaged in endless conflict with each other. From the Jataka Tales, we are told that the Asuras are always fighting to regain their lost kingdom on the top of Mount Sumeru, but are unable to break the guard of the Four Great Kings.; also, see, Pali Text Society, Jataka Tales; PTS, J.i.202-4. The Asuras are divided into many groups, and have no single ruler, but among their leaders are Vemacitrin (PƒÅli: Vepacitti) and RƒÅhu. According to Marasinghe: > \\"In later texts we find the Asura realm as one of the four unhappy states of > rebirth. The NikƒÅya evidence however does not show that the Asura realm was > regarded as a state of suffering\\" Related sutta: Rattana Sutta * 3 - Hungry ghost (pretha loka): This is the realm where ghost and unhappy spirits wander in vain, hopelessly in search of sensual fulfillment. Related sutta : Tirokudda Kanda from the Khuddakapatha * 2 - Animal (tiracchana yoni): The animal realm includes animals, insects, fish, birds, worms, etc.. * 1 - Hell realms (niraya) These are realms of extreme sufferings are mentioned in the Balapandita Sutta and the Devaduta Sutta.

Titles He was the second son of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl, and younger brother of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. He also bore the ecclesiastical titles of Bishop of Caithness, his grant confirmed by Pope Paul III in January 1542, an office previously held by his maternal uncle Andrew Stewart, and Commendator of St Andrews Cathedral Priory. When Matthew, 4th Earl of Lennox, died in 1571, his heir was his grandson King James VI, as his eldest son Lord Darnley had died in 1567, so the title merged in the Crown. It was recreated for Matthew's second son Charles, (Darnley's younger brother), 1st Earl of Lennox (1572 creation), but he died without male issue in 1576. Robert Stewart was next in line, and was created Earl of Lennox and Lord Darnley on 16 June 1578. In 1580 Robert resigned his Earldom of Lennox and Lordship of Darnley; they were recreated the following year for his nephew Esm√© Stewart, son of John Stewart, seigneur d'Aubigny, third son of the third Earl of Lennox. On 5 March 1580 he was created Earl of March and Lord of Dunbar and held these titles until his death. As he had no legitimate issue, the titles again reverted to the crown. Life In 1543, Matthew and Robert Stewart came to oppose the rule of Regent Arran and Mary of Guise in Scotland. After the battle of Glasgow, in April 1543 Robert crossed the Clyde from Dumbarton Castle and rode to England, where he was regarded as a 'pledge' or hostage for Lennox.Cameron, Annie I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), 72, 81: Haynes, Samuel, ed., Collection of State Papers, (1740), p.39 As the war of the Rough Wooing continued, Robert Stewart briefly occupied Dumbarton Castle against the Scottish Government of Regent Arran. Robert came from England in May 1546 with the support of Henry VIII; he sailed from Chester with around 20 followers in the Katherine Goodman accompanied by a pinnace.Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, 1542-1547, vol.1 (1890), 379 Having borrowed the artillery of the Earl of Argyle, Arran successfully besieged the castle, which surrendered after 20 days.

She was the first female mayor of Portland, Oregon; she also served in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, on the Multnomah County Commission, and on the United States Parole Commission. Early life Dorothy McCullough was born in Oakland, California, on April 1, 1901. She was the only child of Flora (n√©e Hill) and Frank E. McCullough, who became a rear admiral in World War I. Her early life involved a great deal of travel including Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, China, Guam, and much of Europe. When her father was stationed in Washington, D.C., as assistant surgeon general she sneaked out at night to listen intently to the suffrage debates in Congress. Her formal education was limited until she entered Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island, where she graduated at age 16. She was determined to become an attorney (against her parents' wishes). She earned a B.A. during her prelaw education from the University of California, Berkeley, in the spring of 1921 and a J.D. degree at the same institution in June 1923. She was admitted to the State Bar of California in January 1923 and practiced law in San Francisco until July 1924. She married William Scott Lee on June 11, 1924, and moved to Portland, Oregon, where her husband, a chemical engineer, became an executive for the Standard Oil Company. McCullough Lee was admitted to the Oregon State Bar in October 1924 and began a small private legal practice in December. In 1931, she and Gladys M. Everett created Oregon's first all-woman law firm, opening their firm in Portland's Failing Building. Oregon political career Dorothy McCullough Lee was a representative in the Oregon House of Representatives for two terms from 1929-1931. She was appointed by the Multnomah County Commission to a vacated seat, and then won a seat in the Oregon Senate, where she served from 1932 to 1943. Richard A.Clucas et.al.: Orgeon politics and government: progressives versus conservative populists. University of Nebraska Press.2005 p. 87 Lee resigned from the Oregon Senate to assume the vacant city council seat of Clark D. Van Fleet, appointed to her by Mayor Earl Riley (on the recommendation of the man who became her most consistent opponent, commissioner Fred. L. Peterson). She vacated her law practice, then in the American Bank Building, to devote her full attention to city business. She became the first woman on the Portland City Council, and was the commissioner of public utilities. In office, she extended city water, modernized the traction system (battles with the Portland Traction Company earned her the nickname \\"Dauntless Dottie\\"), and applied United States Department of War methods including the loan of a U.S. Army bomber to effectively control mosquitoes. She was elected in 1944 to office. The city council rotated the president of the council position when the mayor was out of town. She became, technically, the first female mayor on January 16, 1946, when Mayor Riley was out of town. After a scandal in the mayor‚Äôs office involving Earl Riley and police officers and bribery, Lee was petitioned to run for office. She ran for and won a term as mayor, defeating seven candidates including Riley, in a landslide primary election, receiving 85,045 votes to Riley's 22,510. She said, \\"The forces are evil are pretty deep-seated in this city\\" and promised to \\"clean up sin, gambling, and prostitution\\". She was sworn in on January 1, 1949. She was the second woman to serve as mayor of a major U.S. city. She started her term of office by shaking up the administration of the police department. She forced the removal of slot machines from American Legion, Eagles, and Shrine facilities and even the prestigious Multnomah Athletic Club. She reorganized the police department, ferreting out corruption and enforced city ordinances against vice. Her administration instituted one-way traffic patterns in the downtown and revitalized the Housing Authority of Portland. She promoted an ordinance that passed unanimously prohibiting anyone from being excluded in a public place in Portland. She survived a recall effort in October 1949 and derision in the press (she was called \\"No Sin Lee\\" after closing the Chinese gambling establishments), but her anti-gambling stance likely cost her a second mayoral term. Later career Lee was appointed to the U.S. Board of Parole by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 7, 1953. She was appointed to the Subversive Activities Control Board on September 4, 1956, and appointed chairman on January 2, 1957 (her new position becoming effective January 21). While serving in this role she called for more women to seek employment in public affairs. She resigned this position in August 1962 to resume her law practice and to serve as a lecturer at Portland State University and the University of Portland. Awards Western Airlines honored her first anniversary as mayor by naming a new Convair CV-240 airliner The Dorothy McCullough Lee. The Woman's National Press Club selected her as one of the nation‚Äôs six most distinguished women in April 1949. She was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Mills College in Oakland in June 1949. Personal life Lee had two children, adopted as infants, David Scott Lee (born July 4, 1936, and received by the Lees five days later) and Priscilla Dorothy Lee (born October 30, 1937). Her husband, William Scott Lee, died on February 6, 1976. Death Early in 1981, Dorothy McCullough Lee suffered a heart attack. On February 19, 1981, she died at Park View Nursing Home. She is buried in Portland's River View Cemetery in the McCullough family plot beside her parents and her husband.

The name may derive from Slavic rada - \\"council\\" or \\"rad\\" - \\"eager\\" and gostiti or hostit - \\"to host\\", meaning \\"the one who hosts the council\\" or \\"eager to host - hospitable\\". It could have been a personal name, or an acquired title designating the leader or chieftain of a council, assembly, or veche. Menander Protector writes about Ardagast in his works, and the Strategikon of Maurice (late 6th century) makes mention of him. Ardagast may have led the Slavs who plundered Greece in 577. After the Avar Khagan Bayan I and the Byzantine Emperor Emperor Maurice concluded a treaty in 584, Ardagast raided Thrace, penetrating as far as the Long Wall. The Slavs suffered defeats only twice: at the Erginia river near the Long Walls (583) and in the Ansinon neighbourhood of Hadrianople at the hands of Comentiolus. The Slavs were later driven out of the Astica region. The raid in Thrace in 585Balkan studies: biannual publication of the Institute for Balkan Studies, Volume 37, p. 48 prompted Emperor Maurice to deal with the Slavs - sending an army under commander-in-chief Priscus and infantry commander Gentzon to cross the Danube at Dorostolon (present-day Silistra) and to carry out a surprise attack on the Slavs in their own territory (as the Slavs had long been pillaging the Byzantine Empire).History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, p. 128 The Byzantine army arrived at the Slavic camp at midnight, surprising the Slavs, who fled in confusion; Ardagast fell on a tree stump and was almost captured, but luckily he was near a river and eluded the attackers. Priscus sent his lieutenant Alexander across the Helibakion (Ialomi≈£a River) to find Slavs who were hiding in the woods and swamps, they failed to burn out the people hiding there, but a Gepid Christian who was associated with the Slavs deserted and revealed a secret passage. The Byzantine army then easily captured the Slavs, who according to the Gepid, were spies sent by King Musokios, who just heard about the attack on Ardagast.History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, p. 129 References *History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, Vol 2 South Slavic history 6th-century people 6th- century Slavs Slavic warriors ","title":"Ardagast"},{"id":"28931437","text":"Rory Joseph Burns (born 26 August 1990) is an English cricketer who plays for Surrey. He made his international debut for the England cricket team in November 2018. He is a left-handed batsman who opens in first-class cricket and occasionally fields as a wicket-keeper.

He was a Justice of the Supreme Court (now known as the High Court of New Zealand) (1935‚Äì51). Early life Callan was the son of John Bartholomew Callan, a Dunedin lawyer and member of the New Zealand Legislative Council. He was born on 15 August 1882, five years after his family's arrival in New Zealand from Australia. The Callans had migrated from Ireland to Australia with the Gavan Duffy family and Callan was descended from Charles Gavan Duffy. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Dunedin (where he was Dux in 1897) and commenced his law studies before the Law Faculty of the University of Otago came into being. His principal instructor was James Garrow, a well-known New Zealand legal scholar. On 10 July 1913, at the North East Valley Roman Catholic Church, Dunedin, Callan married Margaret Elizabeth, daughter of James Dugald Mowat, a Dunedin stationer, and they had one son. Lawyer After graduating BA and LL.B at the University of Otago, Callan entered his father's office (Callan and Gallaway) and became a partner in the firm when his father was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council in 1907. He was appointed a lecturer in law at Otago University in 1912. During World War I, Callan served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and became a Captain. On his returned to Dunedin he continued his law practice. He also became Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Otago and he resumed his lectures in Torts there. Callan took silk in 1934, and he moved to Wellington. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. On the bench Callan was appointed a Justice in the Supreme Court in 1935 and went to Auckland as a resident Judge. As a Judge, apart from the normal case load, Justice Callan also undertook Government investigations on the Aliens Tribunal and on the leakage of information (both relevant to World War II). Callan also contributed on a wider stage. Apart from his ten years as Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Otago (1924‚Äì34), he was also a member of the Council of Legal Education. Judicial character Callan was recognised as one of the most kind and erudite judges of his era. He was characterised by his interest in detail in his cases. \\"He observed every facet of a case and frequently made comments that were reported in the press\\". He was much given to asking questions during a legal argument. \\"He had also a keen dramatic sense. His favourite leisure occupation seemed to be the recital in detail of matters grave or gay in some case with which he had been concerned either as counsel or Judge.\\" He once observed that practice at the bar encouraged self-expression. But that, as the judges were recruited from the bar, such experts in self-expression were, as judges, put in a place where their greatest virtue was to be able to hold their tongues. Catholic layman Callan was a Catholic and was a leading layman for the New Zealand church. He was a close friend of James Michael Liston, the Catholic Bishop of Auckland. They had been contemporaries at the Christian Brothers School in Dunedin and like Liston, Callan had continued a close association with the Christian Brothers. For example, when in 1939 Liston opened the new Christian Brother's school, St Peter's College, Auckland, Callan sat on the podium with the bishop, representing the ex-pupils of the brothers. In 1922, (while still practising in Dunedin) Callan provided legal advice to Liston when the latter was charged with treason. When Pope Pius XII stated that Catholic judges should not play any part in divorce cases, a disturbed Callan indicated that he was prepared to resign but decided, after discussion with Liston, that the Pope's statement did not apply to New Zealand as \\"divorce could be understood to refer to the civil contract of marriage rather than to the sacrament of matrimony\\". In spite of this decision, Callan remained a close friend of Liston until his death. Death Callan died in Auckland on 12 February 1951 at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife and his son. His Requiem Mass was celebrated by Liston at St Patrick's Cathedral and as his cortege left the cathedral, it passed through a guard of honour formed by boys from St Peter's College.

Resolution =Observations= In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council praised the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to build peace in the subregion and to countries contributing towards UNAMSIL. It welcomed progress made towards benchmarks for the drawdown of UNAMSIL in accordance with resolutions 1436 (2002) and 1492 (2003). At the same time, the Council noted that progress towards the benchmarks was fragile and there were concerns about security and the capabilities of the Sierra Leone Police. The introduction also stressed the importance of the consolidation of state authority throughout Sierra Leone, including the diamond-producing and border areas. Furthermore, it was important that free and fair local elections were held in May 2004, according to the Council. A Human Rights Commission was to be established following a report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Council also noted the need for the Sierra Leonean government to assume responsibility for the country's national security as soon as possible, and the Secretary-General's conclusion that a small presence of the United Nations had to remain in Sierra Leone into 2005. =Acts= Extending UNAMSIL's mandate, the Council welcomed the Secretary-General's adjustment of the drawdown timetable to ensure a more gradual military reduction. It urged the government of Sierra Leone to continue efforts to develop a sustainable police force, army, penal system and independent judiciary so that it could assume full responsibility from UNAMSIL at the end of its mandate. The Council also urged the government to increase control and regulation of the diamond mining industry. The resolution authorised a residual presence of UNAMSIL to remain in Sierra Leone until June 2005, while being reduced to 3,250 troops, 141 military observers and 80 United Nations police. Tasks for the remaining personnel would be arranged by 30 September 2004. Meanwhile, the Secretary- General was requested to report on the situation in Sierra Leone, the conflict in Liberia and on the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone by 15 September 2004, particularly welcoming his intention to keep the human rights, humanitarian, security and political situation in Sierra Leone under review. The Council appreciated the work of the Special Court but noted financial concerns, calling for countries to submit outstanding contributions. Finally, UNAMSIL was asked to share its expertise with the United Nations Mission in Liberia and United Nations Operation in C√¥te d'Ivoire, particularly with regard to the movements of weapons and combatants across borders.

Menander Protector writes about Musokios in his works. Raid on Ardagast Ardagast, a commander of Musokios, was sent and raided Thrace, which prompted Emperor Maurice to deal with the Antae - sending an army with commander-in-chief Priscus and infantry commander Gentzon to cross the Danube at Dorostolon (present-day Silistra) and surprise attack the Slavs in their own territory (as the Slavs had long been pillaging the Byzantine Empire). The Army arrived at the Antae camp at midnight, surprising the Slavs who fled in confusion, Ardagast fell on a tree stump and was almost captured, but luckily he was near a river and eluded the caption. Priscus sent his lieutenant Alexander across the Helibakion (Ialomi≈£a River) to find Slavs who were hiding in the woods and swamps, they failed to burn out the people hiding, but a Gepid Christian who was associated with the Slavs deserted and showed a secret passage after which the army easily captured the Slavs, who according to the Gepid, were spies sent by King Musokios that just heard about the attack on Ardagast. End When lieutenant Alexander returned with the Gepid and captives, the Gepid received handsome presents and arranged a strategy to bring Musokios and his army into the hands of the Byzantines. The Gepid contacted Musokios and asked him to send a transport across the Paspirion river for the remaining army of Ardagast, Musokios assembled 150 monoxyles and 30 oarsmen which crossed the river. Meanwhile, Priscus approached the banks and met with the Gepid and arranged an ambush with 200 men in the guidance of Alexander. On the following night, the boatmen were heavily intoxicated of wine and fell asleep. The Gepid gave the signal and the Slav colony was slaughtered, with the boats taken into Byzantine possession and filled with 300 soldiers heading towards Musukios. A funeral ceremony of the brother of Musukios took place at the camp, with the people, as the boatsmen, being heavily intoxicated. Musukios was surprised and taken alive, a massacre lasted til the morning. Some Slavs escaped and returned to kill some of the army, as a result, Priscus hanged the negligent guards.

Description The Rutenberg power station, named for Pinhas Rutenberg, is owned and operated by the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC). Rutenberg is the newest thermal power station in Israel and the second largest in terms of generation capacity. It accounts for about fifteen percent of the IEC's total capacity. The power station is situated close to the sea since its cooling system uses sea water. =Technical data= The power station has a total installed capacity of 2,250 MW. It is arranged in two blocks, each containing two power generating units.Installed Capacity. IEC (2009) Two 550 MW boilers were supplied by Combustion Engineering (ABB) and two 575 MW boilers were supplied by Babcock & Wilcox. Turbines and generators were supplied by GEC-Alstom and ABB. The power station consumes 18,240 tonnes of coal per day, and 330 tonnes of cooling water per hour. Pollution control Block B was constructed with a scrubber (for FGD), while additional pollution control devices were being fitted to the block in 2020. Block A was not originally constructed with an FGD scrubber but one was later retrofitted to it (which also necessitated the construction of a new flue stack). It along with other pollution control devices (including an SCR system for reduction) became operational in December 2018. https://www.iec.co.il/spokesman/pages/24122018.aspx History Construction began in the early 1980s, after completion of the first phase of the Orot Rabin power station near Hadera. Phase A became operational in 1990. Phase B was finished in 2000. Coal was transported to the station by freight trains from the Port of Ashdod until an on-site deepwater coal pier was completed in 2000. Cancelled expansion Phase D expansion consisting of additional coal units at the site was approved in 2008. However, several subsequent objections and the greatly increased availability of domestically- produced natural gas in Israel as an alternative to imported coal starting in the early 2010s led to the plan's cancellation. As a result, 60 dunams of land originally reserved for phase D expansion at the site will be returned by the IEC to the State of Israel in 2020. If built, Phase D would have increased plant generation capacity by an additional 1,250 MW.

Early life  He was born on October 5, 1915 in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania. His father was a Sicilian immigrant who worked as a coal miner. His singing ability was recognized and encouraged early on by his mother, who taught him traditional Italian folk songs. In 1923, he moved with his parents and four sisters to his father's village in Sicily, and there his exposure to local culture promoted his musical advancement and inspired him to begin composing little songs. Sadly, his mother died when he was just 9 years old, which added an element of heartbreak to his inspiration that would be later evident in his songs about dealing with hardships. In 1931, at age 15, he moved back to the United States, with dreams of becoming an opera singer. He lived with his sister in the Bronx, New York. To earn money to pay for voice lessons, he took jobs as a shoeshine boy, hat blocker, and busboy. He also entered into singing competitions at local theaters and radio stations, slowly developing a fanbase in the local Italian-American communities. He also learned the jewelry business and opened up a store in 1942. He wrote and performed his own jingles on the radio as commercial advertisements for his jewelry store, earning him public recognition of his talent and humor. Once, he even bought a 10-minute radio advertising spot in which he sang as \\"Il Cantante Misterioso\\" (\\"The Mysterious Singer\\"). He soon became a regular guest on New York radio shows as well as in other cities.  Musical career  Despite his growing popularity, Paone was unable to find a record company willing to sign him, so he started his own label, Etna Records and began work on his first record \\"U Sciccareddu\\" (\\"The Little Donkey\\"), which became an overnight hit. Over the near-two decades of his singing career, \\"the Italian Bing Crosby,\\" as he was sometimes called, released over 150 songs in English or Italian, including such hits as \\"Tony the Iceman,\\" \\"The Big Professor,\\" \\"Blah, Blah, Blah\\" which was ranked No. 1 on the U.S. charts by Cash Box magazine in January 1959, and \\"Uei Paesano\\" (\\"My Countryman\\"), which sold 5 million copies. He would briefly also sign with Columbia and RCA, but preferred his own label. In the late 1940s, wishing to further expand his audience beyond Italian-Americans, Paone formed a vaudeville troupe whose act included midgets, comedians and trained bears, performing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Palace Theater on Broadway. His popularity soon grew outside of the U.S. to Europe, South America, and as far as Israel, where his song \\"The Telephone No Ring\\" became a hit in a Hebrew-language adaptation by the comedy troupe HaGashash HaHiver. He was especially popular in Argentina, where he was known as \\"the Italian Troubadour,\\" performing in a black cape with silver lining. In Buenos Aires on May 1, 1954, he is credited with calming a crowd of 750,000 rioting against the government by singing his trademark song \\"Uei Paesano.\\" In the 1950s, Paone sued Louis Prima, a singer and musician also from Sicily, over his song \\"The Little Donkey,\\" which he felt was a copyright infringement against his own record \\"U Sciccareddu.\\" The two parties eventually negotiated a settlement.\\"Nicola Paone\\" Songs of Italy. June 3, 2004  Restaurateur  By the late 1950s, at the height of his success, Paone had grown weary of the touring life and, wishing to spend more time with his wife, Delia, and young son, Joseph, he decided to bring his professional music career to a close and begin a new career path, as restaurateur. In 1958, he opened the Nicola Paone Restaurant at 207 East 34th Street in New York City. With decor resembling an Italian marketplace, the restaurant quickly became one of the top Italian eateries in the city, with Paone himself assuming some of the cooking duties and contributing such specialties as \\"Veal Boom Boom\\" and \\"Pasta Serenata\\" to the menu. The restaurant had served countless patrons over its 50 years of operation, including every New York City mayor from Robert Wagner to Rudolph Giuliani.\\"Legendary Italian Eatery Serves Its Last\\" Crains New York. June 26, 2008 In his 1978 review, conservative writer, commentator, and editor of the National Review William F. Buckley, pronounced Nicola Paone Restaurant his favorite restaurant. He said, \\"I can name my favorite restaurant as glibly as I can name my favorite wife, country, religion, and journal of opinion. It is (I should like to say, \\"of course,\\" but Paone's is not widely known) Nicola Paone; its address is 207 East 34th Street New York, and I suppose I have eaten there a hundred times in the last 10 years, which would certainly account for my being Paone's favorite customer; but, believe me, in this courtship, I was the suitor.\\"\\"The Color of Money\\" Dunk's Dictums. 2005 Buckley was a frequent patron for decades and became good friends with Paone. He even named a character after Paone in his novel \\"Spy Time: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton.‚Äù After retiring from his singing career, Paone rarely performed publicly. He did a brief tour in Argentina in the late 1960s and some performances for charity in the late 1980s. Just as he did for his jewelry store many years earlier, he would sing jingles as commercial advertisements for his restaurant on WQXR. He would also occasionally entertain his restaurant patrons with his guitar, singing a selection of his hits.  Retirement and death  After running his restaurant for 40 years, Paone retired in 1998. In 2002, he and his wife moved from their longtime Scarsdale, NY home to a nursing home in Albuquerque, NM, to be near their son Joseph, who later died suddenly in August 2003. On Christmas Day, 2003, Paone died at age 88, after falling ill with pneumonia.\\"Article: Nicola Paone, Singer-Songwriter Who Chronicled Italian Immigrant Experience and Restaurateur, Dies at 88 \\" The Italian Voice.

Clark & Co. was a banking and financial firm founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1837 by Enoch White Clark. Among its partners were American Civil War financier Jay Cooke and West Philadelphia developer Clarence Howard Clark. The firm merged in 1960 with Janney, Dulles & Battles, Inc., to become Janney, Battles & E.W. Clark, now part of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company.Janney history History =19th century= Clark came to Philadelphia from Providence, Rhode Island, in 1836. The next year, he created his firm with his two brothers, Luther Clapp Clark (July 4, 1815 - 1877) and Joseph Washington Clark (1810-1892); and brother-in-law, Edward Dodge. The firm did well, earning enough to pay off Enoch Clark's debts in seven years, then to propel the Clarks to a place among the city's wealthiest families. The firm opened branches in New York City, St. Louis, and New Orleans, and made considerable money performing domestic exchanges in the wake of the 1836 revocation of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States and the Panic of 1837. Moody's magazine, a monthly publication of the Moody's credit rating agency, later wrote: > During the first ten years of its development the firm gained wide > recognition and public confidence, owing to the indomitable energy of Enoch > W. Clark.The drafts of this house drawn between the various branches, were > regarded as the very best circulating medium in the West. There were more > than $2,000,000 worth of these drafts in circulation within a short time > after the establishment of the western branch offices and they were > considered everywhere as the equivalent of gold. At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), the U.S. government borrowed about $50,000,000 from the firm, then recognized as \\"the leading domestic exchange house\\" in the country. In 1849, Enoch's oldest son, Edward White Clark, became a member of the firm, and Jay Cooke, who had been with the house since 1842, was made a partner. Cooke retired from the firm in 1854, and went on to even greater fame and fortune by helping to sell the bonds that financed the U.S. Civil War. The elder Clark died in 1856 of complications of nicotine poisoning. In 1887, David Crawford Clark (January 23, 1864, at New York, New York-???), a son of company co-founder Luther Clapp Clark and his wife Julia Crawford, became a partner in Clark, Dodge & Co.Clark lived at 24 West 39th Street in New York.

In 1882, Edward's son Edward Walter Clark, Jr. became a partner; Clarence's son C. Howard Clark, Jr. followed two years later. The firm began investing in public utilities around this time, and went on to control many public utility and railroad properties.Obituary for Clark Jr. It exercised conservative management, and through 1914 had never defaulted on principal or interest payments on the bonded debt of its public utility corporations. =20th century= In 1900, the firm brought on Edward W.

Kendrick spurred the firm's bond business. The firm opened branch offices in Boston, Reading, Wilkes-Barre, Pittsburgh and Chicago. As of 1914, the firm's partners were E.W. Clark Jr., Clarence M.

Medical use Lixisenatide is used as adjunct to diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. In the European Union, its use is limited to complementing insulin therapy. As of 2017 it is unclear if they affect a person's risk of death. It is provided in an autoinjector containing fourteen doses and is injected subcutaneously. Lixisenatide should not be used for people who have problems with stomach emptying. Lixisenatide delays emptying of the stomach, which may change how quickly other drugs that are taken by mouth take effect. Lixisenatide in neurodegenerative diseases: Results from a research work which was done by McClean PL et al. demonstrated that the GLP-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and lixisenatide which are on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes show promise as potential drug treatments of Alzheimer disease AD. Lixisenatide was equally effective at a lower dose compared to liraglutide in some of the measured parameters after ten weeks of daily intraperitoneal injections with liraglutide (2.5 or 25 nmol/kg) or lixisenatide (1 or 10 nmol/kg) or saline of APP/PS1 mice at an age when amyloid plaques had already formed. When analyzing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, LTP was strongly increased in APP/PS1 mice by either drug, with more effectiveness accomplished with lixisenatide. The reduction of synapse numbers seen in APP/PS1 mice was prevented by the two drugs. The amyloid plaque load and dense-core Congo red positive plaque load in the cortex were reduced by both drugs at all doses. The chronic inflammation response (microglial activation) was also reduced by all treatments Cai HY et al. demonstrated in a study that lixisenatide could reduce amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation in the hippocampi of 12-month- old APP/PS1/tau female mice; activation of PKA-CREB signaling pathway and inhibition of p38-MAPK might be the important mechanisms in the neuroprotective function of lixisenatide. So, lixisenatide might have the potential to be developed as a novel therapy for AD Liu Wet al found an interesting results when comparing exendin-4 (10 nmol/kg), liraglutide (25 nmol/kg) and lixisenatide (10 nmol/kg), it was found that exendin-4 showed no protective effects at the dose chosen, while both liraglutide and lixisenatide showed effects in preventing the MPTP-induced motor impairment (Rotarod, open- field locomotion, catalepsy test), reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels (dopamine synthesis) in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia, a reduction of the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX and an increase in the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule B-cell lymphoma-2. The previous results demonstrate that both liraglutide and lixisenatide are superior to exendin-4, and both drugs show promise as a novel treatment of Parkinson disease Another study done by Kerry Hunter et al. profiled the GLP-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and lixisenatide. The kinetics of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), activation of the GLP-1R by measuring cAMP levels, and physiological effects in the brain on neuronal stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis were evaluated. Both drugs were able to cross the BBB. Lixisenatide crossed the BBB at all doses tested (2.5, 25, or 250 nmol/kg ip.) when measured 30 min post- injection and at 2.5-25 nmol/kg ip. 3 h post-injection. Lixisenatide also enhanced neurogenesis in the brain. Liraglutide crossed the BBB at 25 and 250 nmol/kg ip. but no increase was detectable at 2.5 nmol/kg ip. 30 min post- injection, and at 250 nmol/kg ip. at 3 h post-injection. Liraglutide and lixisenatide enhanced cAMP levels in the brain, with lixisenatide being more effective. The previous results suggest that these novel incretin analogues cross the BBB showing physiological activity and neurogenesis in the brain, which makes them good candidates to be used as a treatment of neurodegenerative diseases Adverse effects In about 0.1% of cases people have had anaphylactic reactions to lixisenatide and in about 0.2% of cases the drug has caused pancreatitis. Use with insulin or sulfonylurea may cause hypoglycemia. In some cases, people with no kidney disease have had acute kidney injury and in some people with existing kidney disease the condition has gotten worse. Because lixisenatide is a peptide people can and do develop an immune response to it that will eventually make the drug ineffective; people who have developed antibodies to lixisenatide tend to have more inflammation at the injection site. At least 5% of people had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, or dizziness after taking lixisenatide. Mechanism of action Lixisenatide is a member of the class of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist drugs, each of which activates the GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1 is a hormone that helps pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin in response to high blood sugar. Because it works like the normal hormone, insulin is only secreted when blood sugar is high. Like GLP-1, it also slows gastric emptying. Chemistry Lixisenatixe is a peptide made of 44 amino acids, with an amide group on its C terminus. has been described as \\"des-38-proline-exendin-4 (Heloderma suspectum)-(1‚Äì39)-peptidylpenta-L-lysyl- L-lysinamide\\", meaning it is derived from the first 39 amino acids in the sequence of the peptide exendin-4, that was isolated from the Gila monster venom, omitting proline at position 38 and adding six lysine residues.

Lixisenatide was approved by the European Commission on February 1, 2013. Sanofi submitted an NDA in the US, which was accepted for review by the US FDA in February 2013 but after discussions with the FDA about the cardiovascular safety data included in the package (starting in 2008, the FDA had required stronger CV safety data for new anti-diabetes drugs, following the controversy around the risks of Avandia) Sanofi decided to withdraw the NDA and wait for the results of a Phase III study that was scheduled to be completed in 2015. Because the drug was the first GLP-1 agonist that could be taken once a day, sales projections in 2013 were ‚Ç¨500M per year by 2018. Sanofi resubmitted the application which the FDA accepted in September 2015, by which time Sanofi had lost the lead in the field of anti-diabetic drugs to Novo Nordisk. Lixisenatide received FDA approval on July 28, 2016. In 2010, Zeland and Sanofi extended their license agreement to allow Sanofi to develop a combination therapy of lixisenatide with insulin glargine, which was Sanofi's best selling drug at the time, with sales of around ‚Ç¨3 billion in 2009. Sanofi planned to start the Phase III trial that year. Sanofi submitted the NDA in December 2015 for the combination, called LixiLan and it was considered by the same Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory FDA Committee that was considering lixisenatide as a single agent. In May 2016 by a vote of 12-2, with several members of the committee expressing reservations about Sanofi's plans to offer two pens with different ratios of insulin glargine and lixisenatide - one for people who had never taken insulin before and one for people who had; there was also concern about how to handle dosing when switching people from a single drug regimen to the combination drug. In August 2016 the FDA told Sanofi that it was delaying a final decision for three months, and asked Sanofi for more data on how people used the delivery devices. Patent protection for lixisenatide expires in 2020.

The film was released on December 22, 1957 by Allied Artists and is the forty-seventh film in the series. Plot The Bowery Boys have been collecting money to help a young polio victim in the neighborhood. At Mike Clancy's caf√©, Sach is entrusted with taking the ninety dollars they collected to the bank. Sam, a new customer of Mike's, offers to give Sach a ride to the bank, but takes him instead to a phony bookie joint where, unaware that the operation is not legitimate, he loses all the money to con men Tony and Al. After Duke berates him for losing the cash, Sach tells Blinky that he would give his very soul to get even with the bookies. Seconds after Blinky leaves, Sach receives a visit from the devil, sporting a morning coat and two small horns under his hat. The devil offers Sach a deal: he will provide Sach with the name of a winning horse every day for a week in return for Sach's soul. Although scared, Sach ultimately agrees and, after signing the devil's contract, is provided with his winner of the day. When Sach returns to Tony and Al to make a bet, they ask him for cash. Sach then decides to sell a jalopy belonging to the boys and takes it to a used car dealer, unaware that Duke has just sold the car to a patrol officer. The dealer virtually tears the car apart to reduce its value and offers Sach a dime for it, just as the policeman finds and arrests him. The devil visits Sach in jail and gives him the name of another winning horse. When Sach's horse wins, Tony and Al wonder if he might have inside information. With Mike's help, Duke and the others bail Sach out and the next day, the devil reappears in the form of an organ grinder's monkey with another tip. After the boys discover Sach chatting with the monkey, they arrange for him to visit a psychiatrist, but Sach only confuses the doctor, who ends up asking him for tips on winning horses. With twenty dollars borrowed from Mike, Sach returns to the phony bookie joint to bet on the newest horse the devil gave him, and Tony and Al decide to lay legitimate bets on the same horse. At the last moment, however, Sach is persuaded by a tout to bet on a different horse and everybody loses. Tony and Al are mystified by Sach's inside information and persuade Mabel, Tony's girl friend, to take a waitress job at Mike's to keep tabs on Sach and to find out the source of his tips. On the last day of their agreement, the devil gives Sach a hundred dollar bill and tells him to go to the racetrack and await word on the winning horse's name. Sach and Duke go to the track, accompanied by Mabel, and are followed by Tony, Al and Sam. Just after Sach receives the horse's name, \\"Rubber Check,\\" from the devil, disguised as a soft drinks salesman, Chuck arrives with the news that the Polio Fund has agreed to pay for the boy's treatment. Sach then realizes that they now do not need the money and he can cancel the devil's contract. Duke, however, insists on betting on Rubber Check and Mabel tips off Tony and the others. Sach talks with the devil and attempts to break the contract, but the devil refuses and points out that if the horse wins, Sach's soul is his. Sach then convinces Duke to help him to disable Rubber Check's jockey after which Sach takes his place in the race, but is unable to stop the horse from winning. Just after Sach explains the full dimensions of his problem to Duke, the devil reappears to claim him, but is thwarted by an official track announcement that Rubber Check is disqualified as he had an unauthorized jockey, thereby nullifying the devil's contract with Sach and causing Tony and his gang to lose all their money. Back in the Bowery, Sach is surprised to find the disenfranchised devil working as a busboy at Mike's. After the devil tells him that he can regain his \\"horns\\" by securing new clients, Sach directs him towards the bookies.

Taxonomy Leucotrichum was established in 2010 and has about six currently recognized species. The type species for the genus is Leucotrichum organense. Four of the species had been in Lellingeria, and one, Leucotrichum mortonii, had been in the defunct genus Xiphopteris. In 2004, a phylogenetic study of DNA sequences of grammitids showed that a few species of Lellingeria are not closely related to the others.Tom A. Ranker, Alan R. Smith, Barbara S.

They are sister to a clade of 26 species which at that time were in the genus Terpsichore. This was confirmed six years later in another molecular phylogenetic study on the grammitids. In 2010, four species from Lellingeria and one from Xiphopteris were transferred to the new genus Leucotrichum. The clade of 26 species that is sister to Leucotrichum was named as a new genus, Alansmia, in 2011.Michael Kessler, Ana Laura Moguel Vel√°zquez, Michael A. Sundue and Paulo H.

He made his MLB debut in 2012 for the Seattle Mariners, and has also played for the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox. Listed at and , he both throws and bats right-handed. Early years At the age of 12, Ram√≠rez left his home in Nicaragua to attend school in San Salvador, El Salvador. The school which he attended, Fundaci√≥n Educando a un Salvadore√±o, was aimed at helping baseball and soccer athletes training in their respective sports, while also offering academic support. From there, Ram√≠rez was discovered by Jorge Bahaia, who introduced him to Seattle Mariners scouts Ubaldo Heredia and Bob Engle. Engle also signed players Jos√© L√≥pez, Ryan Rowland-Smith, and Carlos Triunfel. Professional career =Seattle Mariners= On September 1, 2007, Ram√≠rez officially signed with Seattle Mariners. Ram√≠rez began his professional baseball career in 2008 with the rookie-level VSL Mariners of the Venezuelan Summer League. That season, he compiled a 4‚Äì1 record with a 2.86 earned run average (ERA), one complete game, and 46 strikeouts in 13 games, 11 starts. In 2009, Ram√≠rez continued playing with the VSL Mariners. Before the season, the Seattle Mariners minor league director Pedro Grifol compared Ram√≠rez to Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister. That season, Ram√≠rez compiled an 11‚Äì1 record with a 0.51 ERA, and 80 strikeouts in 14 games, 13 starts. He led the Venezuelan Summer League in wins, ERA, innings pitched (88), and strikeouts. After the season, the Seattle Mariners named Ram√≠rez as the pitcher of the year in their minor league organization. He participated in the Mariners instructional league in Arizona after the 2009 season. Seattle Mariners in 2013 Ram√≠rez spent the early part of the 2010 season in extended spring training with the Seattle Mariners. He was assigned to the Class-A Clinton LumberKings in early-April. On the season, Ram√≠rez was both a Midwest League mid-season all-star and a post-season all-star. He went 10‚Äì4 with a 2.97 ERA, one complete game, one save, and 117 strikeouts in 26 games, 23 starts with Clinton. After the season, Ram√≠rez was named the LumberKings Pitcher of the Year. At the end of the year, Erasmo was awarded in Nicaragua Athlete of the Year by the ACDN (Nicaraguan Association of Sport Journalists) over Everth Cabrera. In 2013, Ram√≠rez was going to join the Mariners starting roster before the start of the regular season before injuring his triceps. He eventually spent time in Class AAA before making his debut of the season with the Mariners on July 11 against the Boston Red Sox, but allowed seven runs in 4 2/3 innings. The following day, Ram√≠rez was sent down to the Everett AquaSox in order to allow him to stay on a regular rotation during the Major League All-Star break, and started July 17's game against the Vancouver Canadians, giving up two runs on six hits while striking out ten in 5 1/3 innings as the AquaSox won 7-6. =Tampa Bay Rays= On March 31, 2015, Ram√≠rez was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays for Mike Montgomery. Ram√≠rez struggled in his first month with the Rays, posting an 0-1 record with a 12.71 ERA. But, when he came back in mid-May from the Durham Bulls he was better for the rotation and team, putting up great numbers for the rest of the season. On September 14 against the New York Yankees he went 7 hitless innings. Ram√≠rez finished the season 11-5 with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings pitched. In 2016, Ram√≠rez made a more permanent switch to the bullpen, specifically in long relief situations. Ram√≠rez ended the season making appearances in 64 games, throwing 90 innings posting a 3.77 ERA.

The weapon was fed from a 32-round box magazine inserted in the side and had an unusual twist-action bakelite-covered handguard.An Illustrated Guide to Rifles and Sub-machine Guns, Salamander Books 1981, , Modern Rifles & Sub-Machine Guns published 1992 Development Following the end of World War Two, the British Army sought a replacement for the Sten which was the submachine gun of the British military since 1940. The Sten was simple, cheap and unrefined. While this very crudity was a positive asset in the straitened circumstances the British found themselves in during the war, a more refined and durable variant was requested. The Sten Mark V was developed to fill this need during 1944, adding a wooden stock, forward pistol grip and better construction. However, by the late 1940s the British Army was testing replacements. The Welgun developed by BSA during the war was briefly considered as was a design from Enfield. However, the Patchett Machine Carbine Mk 1. made by the Sterling Armaments Company which had been trialled during the war was chosen and as the Sterling submachine gun entered service in 1953. However, there was another contender which was also made by BSA. The \\"Experimental Machine Carbine, 1949\\" (EMC). Chambered in the same 9 mm Parabellum cartridge as the Sten with a side- mounted 32-round box magazine, shared by the Sten and later the Sterling. The EMC used blowback action but cycled - faster than the Sterling and all of the earlier Sten variants - at 600 rounds per minute. It came with unusual features, notably a Bakelite pump action foregrip, a hinged magazine insert which could be pivoted backwards to allow jams to be cleared without having to remove the magazine and to facilitate cleaning, and a safety switch in the pistol grip, easily operated by the users thumb. Regardless of the EMC's innovative features the design was not adopted. Overview The BSA Machine Carbine is a blowback-operated, magazine-fed weapon chambered in the 9√ó19mm round. Unusually the weapon lacks a bolt handle; instead it came with an unusual pump-action foregrip operated by pushing it forward and then pulling it back; this pushed a bar which pushed the bolt back and cocked the weapon. The grip was then rotated slightly to disengage the bar and allow the bolt to cycle once fired. In response to the Welgun's open receiver, the EMC was enclosed with only the magazine insert and ejection port open when firing. When the bolt was closed, these openings were covered, minimising the chances of dirt entering the action.

Song poetry refers to Classical Chinese poetry of or typical of the Song dynasty of China (960‚Äì1279). The dynasty was established by the Zhao family in China in 960 and lasted until 1279. Many of the best known Classical Chinese poems, popular also in translation, are from the Song dynasty poets, such as Su Shi (Dongpo), Ouyang Xiu, Lu You and Yang Wanli. This was also a time of great achievement in painting and literature, and many artists were accomplished in more than one of these, as well as often being government officials. Historical background The Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) was the first time that China was unified into one state since the Tang dynasty, the two dynasties were separated from each other by the Tang- Song transition period, known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a period of disunity. The Song period is divided into two parts, the first being the Northern Song (960‚Äì1127) which consisted of the China as reunified by the dynastic founder Emperor Taizu of Song. The second part of the Song period, known as the Southern Song (1127‚Äì1279) because the northern part of the empire was ceded to the military forces of the Jurchens, who formed their own Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) out of this former Song imperial territory. The Southern Song then faced a protracted struggle against the Mongol Empire before finally succumbing to the Mongol forces, who then established themselves as the Chinese Yuan dynasty. Despite the constant military pressure and its numerous foreign affairs difficulties, the Song dynasty was generally a time of growing population, economical prosperity, and excellence in the fine arts. The poetic tradition The poets of the Song dynasty drew on a long tradition of poetry in China, but particularly upon forms prevalent in the Tang dynasty, or in the case of the ci form, that developed toward the end of the Tang dynasty and the period immediately before the Song dynasty, especially seen in the works of Li Yu of the Southern Tang dynasty. One of the new developments was a large increase in the popularity of the Ci form of poetry, a form based on the traditional forms and rhythms, ultimately drawn from popular songs, but with new words. Another development was an increasing fusion of painting and poetry, such as in the various Eight Views of the Xiao Xiang series of matched paintings and poems. Many of the Song Dynasty poets were greatly affected by the politics of the time. Poetry and politics During the Northern Song many of the government officials/poets were caught up on one side or the other over the controversial reformism of the powerful government minister Wang Anshi. One of those affected by his opposition to Wang Anshi's policies was Su Shi, who got his nickname \\"Dongpo\\" from his place of banishment during his first period of exile, in which his poems were used against him as evidence of disloyalty to the empire, in what has been known as the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial. Su Shi's poetry also was much affected by his second period of banishment to what was then an extremely remote imperial outpost on the far southern island of Hainan. During the Southern Song, much of the political controversy was waged around the issue of the status of the occupied northern part of the empire, which had been lost in the Jurchen invasion. Lu You was one of the poets who considered reconquering the north his patriotic duty and wrote poems in this regard. Poets Famous Song dynasty poets include Lu You, Cai Xiang, Chao Chongzhi, Fan Chengda, Fan Zhongyan, Emperor Gaozong of Song, Gong Kai, Han Shizhong, Lady Huarui, Jiang Kui, Lu You, Li Houzhu, Li Qingzhao, Lin Bu, Liu Kezhuang, Lu You, Mei Yaochen, Mi Fu, Lu You, Ouyang Xiu, Qian Chu, Qin Guan, Shao Yong, Shen Kuo, Song Qi, Su Shi, Su Zhe, Wang Anshi, Wang Yucheng, Wen Tianxiang, Wen Tong, Xin Qiji, Yan Yu, Yang Wanli, Yue Fei, Zeng Gong, Zhang Xian, Lu You, Zhu Shuzhen, and Zhu Xi. Poetry, painting, and calligraphy Mi Fu, calligraphy detail. Mi Fu, c. 1100, Indian ink and color on paper. The Song Dynasty is known for its achievements in terms of combining poetry, painting, and calligraphy, called the three perfections, into a shared art form, or as complementary activities. One renowned practitioner of this combination of talents was Mi Fu (also known as Mei Fu). This practice was perhaps more of a rule then an exception for the Song Dynasty poets. Involvement in the writing of prose works was also not uncommon for the Song Dynasty poets; Song Qi and Ouyang Xiu collaborated on the now classic history of the Tang Empire New Book of Tang. The Ci form The Ci as a poetic form perhaps reached a high point during the Song Dynasty. The ci is a kind of lyric Classical Chinese poetry using a poetic meter based upon some 800 prototypical fixed-rhythm forms, originally tunes of songs, each having a traditional title. Each song title therefore came to specify particular fixed pattern of tone, rhythm, number of syllables (or characters) per line and the number of lines. Therefore, it is common for several ci to share the same title, which often has little or nothing to do with the topics of those poems, but rather the patterns that the lyrics follow. Many of its prime proponents were female poets, such as Li Qingzhao. Su Shi was another prominent Song poet famous for writing in the ci form. Xiaoxiang: poems of exile Part of the imaginary tour through Xiao-xiang by Li from the 12th century. Scroll, 30.3 cm x 400.4 cm. Ink on paper. Located at Tokyo National Museum, Tokyo. As in Tang times, many were the poems written by poets, who found, then lost, or never received the high paying and socially prestigious governmental positions that they desired or expected from the imperial court for their perceived abilities, talents, or application thereof: verified through the civil service examinations, actual political management services, or personal perception. Although service to the imperial court (and to the people which it theoretically represented) was a general societal ideal and frequent personal ideal, the arbitrary nature of the imperial power system, its censorial powers, and the vicissitudes of the historical process resulted in a poetic tradition of a strong but subtle dissent. The Xiaoxiang genre of poetry dates back at least to the third century, BCE.Murck, 6 It continued to develop to new levels of subtle expressions of discontent through the Song Dynasty era.

Bass was the art director of the Graphic Arts Department of CBS News during the 1960s, during which time he pioneered the production of a legible typography.\\"Inventing the Vidifont\\" He worked in many aspects of print media including posters, books, magazines, before, during and after his work with television, and was the recipient of an EMMY award. Early life (1914‚Äì1938) Born in Vienna, Austria, Rudi (named Rudolf at birth) was the only child of Friedrich Bass and Auguste Erlich Bass. His father was the chief engineer (Oberingenieur) in Vienna for the railroad, an inventor, and an accomplished pianist; his mother was artistically inclined and an early feminist. He attended Realgymnasium 1 in the Stubenring in Vienna in 1929, where he was immersed in a classical education including languages and math. Upon graduation, Bass was admitted to the Kunstgewerbeschule, now known as The University of Applied Arts, Vienna. With the help of his American uncle, John Bass, whom he joined when he arrived in New York City, Bass emigrated to the United States in the summer of 1938, for political reasons, having twice been imprisoned for distributing leaflets together with other activists against fascism which had already overtaken Austria, but before Kristallnacht, which occurred in November 1938.http://digital.cjh.org:1801/webclient/DeliveryManager?application=DIGITOOL-3&owner;=resourcediscovery&custom;_att_2=simple_viewer&pid;=1309642 Bass was hired by Esquire two weeks after entering the U.S.A. Bass continued working at Esquire until his entry into the U.S. Army in 1943. Bass served during World War II until 1946, during which time he became a U.S. Citizen. Bass‚Äô proclivity in writing extended to poetry as well, and a poem of his entitled, The Heroes was published in \\"The Best from Yank Army Weekly\\" (selected by the editors of Yank, published by E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New York 1945 p. 153). Creative life Later, he was an art director in The New York Times Promotion Department, followed by employment with McCann Erickson, BBDO, and Columbia Records. In television, he was the first, and to date, the only Director of Graphic Arts for CBS. While at CBS, he inspired the creation of the Vidifont, the first electronic graphics generator employed in television production. The first font offered by the Vidifont was the CND-36 (CBS News Division) font that Rudi designed for CBS News. Rudi worked with the lead engineer who designed the Vidifont teaching him the basics of graphics design so that he would understand the nuances of the problem he was trying to solve. Within a year of its introduction, the system was widely adopted by the industry. CBS received an EMMY award in recognition of the Vidifont‚Äôs impact on television production.

He primarily used acrylics for the paintings and India ink for the calligraphy. This body of work had two additional showings in different venues and were very well received in their entirety both for their beauty and their interesting and educational data in the text. During all their years in France and continuing in his studio at home in New York City until shortly before his death, Rudi continued his prolific creative life turning out books, other art work and more (see Published works). He painted, sketched, wrote, designed and created daily and was an inspiration for many much younger than he. At the time of his death, at the age 96, he was working on a project creating a new alphabet to enhance texting on smartphones. An oral history of his life was recorded by the Leo Baeck Institute in New York shortly before his death, and they have spoken for his work and manuscripts for their library.

Honorific In the Ottoman period, the term hatun was used as an honorific for women, roughly equivalent to the English term lady and a variant spelling of khatun. Like most Turkish honorifics, it is used after the first name.

Tew's sculptures are found in institutions, museums, churches and private collections including, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden. She resides in Minneapolis. Education Tew started her education at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design where she studied with Alice Tweton. As an adult, Tew went back to Gustavus Adolphus in St. Peter MN, where she was encouraged by her teacher Paul Granlund (1925‚Äì2003) to pursue Sculptor. Tew attributes most of her influences to the late Architect Ralph Rapson (1914‚Äì2008), who also designed the artist's home and was often found in Tew's studio and the late Modernist Charles Biederman (1906‚Äì2004). Early career Tew began her career as a freelance fashion illustrator in Minneapolis at the age of 15. The drastic change in Tew's artistic direction was brought on by the death of her only child in 1969. Shortly after the tragedy, a friend introduced Tew to Sculptor Paul Granlund, who was the resident sculptor at Gustavus at that time and ultimately became Tews's mentor and friend.

He began his career as a cub reporter for several newspapers and periodicals in Yorkshire, England, becoming Managing Editor of the Eastern Morning News, the Hull Evening News, the Hull Weekly News, the Yorkshire Evening News (all by the age of 27) and, subsequently, Editorial Director of the Argus Press (including the weekly journal, Cavalcade) and Managing Editor of the Sunday Referee which in addition to its extensive coverage of the news, also published articles by literary, philosophical and artistic contributors including Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Osbert Sitwell and Walt Disney (who published his cartoon strip \\"Silly Symphonies\\" in the paper each week). During his tenure at The Sunday Referee, Goulden published the poet, Dylan Thomas, in \\"Poet's Corner\\", and arranged publication of Thomas' first volume of poetry, 18 Poems, through the Panton Press in 1934.Dylan Thomas, The Biography by Paul Ferris Goulden is also considered responsible for initiating the first visit of a reigning British monarch to the United States when, after a meeting with Joseph P. Kennedy in London, Goulden published a proposal on the front page of Cavalcade, 26 July 1938, suggesting that such an event would be \\"in the interests of Anglo-American relations ‚Äì [and] in the interests of democracy.\\" Goulden is also credited as one of the first British publishers to warn the country openly of the rise of the National Socialist Party in Germany, dedicating an entire leader page of The Sunday Referee in April 1933 to an expos√© of the secret lives of the Nazi hierarchy. Goulden wrote, \\"Men of the Hitler-type are the flowers of a system which functions primarily for the individual and condones, with cynical indifference, the economic and political manipulation of the mass with every instrument from religion to the machine- gun.\\" In May 1933, Goulden published an interview with Albert Einstein in which the physicist is reported to have said, \\"Hitler understands how to raise this instinct [for a violent national feeling] to the power of a collective psychosis. He knows that the hate-lust is more easily inflamed in the presence of a visible and tangible enemy. That is why he has incited Nazi fury against the Jews. They are a convenient target ready to hand for the shafts intended in the near future for other races, at present outside the Nazi bowshot. The world must be warned.\\" Goulden's editorial attacks on the National Socialists continued until his departure from the newspaper in 1936. Chairman of the British publishing firm of W.H. Allen and Co. for thirty-six years, Goulden pioneered the area of entertainment publishing, while continuing to bring important literary works to the attention of the British public. He received numerous citations and awards for his work in humanitarian causes. He was also a pioneer in British civil aviation and co-invented the matrix-drying machine that revolutionised the casting of newspaper stereo-plates. Goulden was portrayed in Jane Campion's 1990 movie, \\"An Angel at My Table\\", as the publisher of celebrated author Janet Frame. He died in 1980.

Set in the Star Wars universe, Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue takes passengers on a turbulent trip across the galaxy, as droids C-3PO and R2-D2 attempt to safely return a spy to the Rebel Alliance. The Adventures Continue features locations and characters from Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace through Episode IX ‚Äì The Rise of Skywalker, unlike its predecessor, which mostly took place after the events of the original trilogy (Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope through Episode VI ‚Äì Return of the Jedi). The attraction opened on May 20, 2011 at Disney's Hollywood Studios, on June 3, 2011 at Disneyland, on May 7, 2013 at Tokyo Disneyland, and on March 26, 2017 at Disneyland Paris. Development =Pre-production= In April 2005, at Star Wars Celebration III, creator George Lucas confirmed that a Star Tours II was in production. In May 2009, /Film reported that filming for the new version of Star Tours was underway in West Hollywood, California. During pre-production, one of the locations that Imagineers wanted guests to visit was the ice planet of Hoth while it was under siege by Imperial walkers. However, the idea was quickly scrapped because it would interfere with the attraction's placement in the Star Wars timeline. According to Imagineer Jason Surrell, after the Hoth battle idea was replaced with an encounter with the planet's native fauna (e.g. tauntauns and wampas), the concept was presented to George Lucas. Lucas, although liking the idea, requested that the battle scene be used instead, even if it meant disrupting the series' canon. Lucas offered the possibility that there was perhaps an earlier scuffle between Rebel and Imperial forces on the planet before the events in Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back unfolded and that they \\"later decided to build a base there figuring the Empire wouldn't think the rebels would return to that same location.\\" The Kashyyyk sequence was suggested by John Lasseter. Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the extensive computer-generated imagery seen throughout the attraction. At the 2009 D23 Expo in Anaheim, Walt Disney Imagineering announced that Star Tours at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios would be closed in October 2010 for total renovation and would reopen in May and June 2011 as Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue. The updated ride system would consist of high-definition video, a Dolby 3D high-definition screen, an improved motion simulator, as well as several other newly added special effects. A short teaser trailer was shown at the expo featuring a podracing scene similar to that from Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. An accompanying teaser picture depicted a red-colored \\"StarSpeeder 1000\\" spacecraft. =Previews= In May 2010, Disney announced exact dates for the closure of Star Tours at both parks, both earlier than the originally announced October 2010 date. Star Tours closed on July 27 at Disneyland and on September 7 at Disney's Hollywood Studios. On June 11, 2010, at the \\"What's Next?\\" presentation, Disney announced that the re-imagined attraction would take place between Episodes III and Star Wars ‚Äì Episode IV: A New Hope of the Star Wars film series and would be named Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue. They also premiered an image showcasing the StarSpeeder 1000 flying through Coruscant. On August 12, during Celebration V, Disney showed a preview 'commercial' of what guests may expect to see, including visits to Endor, Bespin, and Alderaan. By September 24, two new characters were revealed for Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue. The first one was Ace, the new pilot, and the second one was the Aly San San spokesdroid, voiced by Allison Janney. During D23's \\"Destination D\\" event, Disneyland Resort President George Kalogridis stated that the new ride would feature 54 possible different experiences. On October 26, Tom Fitzgerald, Executive VP and Senior Creative Executive of Walt Disney Imagineering, stated that while \\"Ace\\" was supposed to be the pilot of the StarSpeeder 1000s, by the time riders actually take off, the pilot would be C-3PO. Fitzgerald also mentioned that Captain Rex, the former Star Tours pilot (but within the series' timeline, the future pilot), would also make an appearance somewhere on the new version of the attraction. Anthony Daniels, who played C-3PO in all the Star Wars films, returned to portray the character in three mediums; live-action suit, motion capture, and Audio-Animatronic voice. Fitzgerald revealed on February 11, 2011, that more characters would be encountered on the ride, including Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Imperial Stormtroopers, \\"Jumptroopers\\", Admiral Ackbar, Yoda, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca. He confirmed on April 1, locations that guests could visit on the new attraction. Destinations include Tatooine, Coruscant, Hoth, Naboo, Kashyyyk, and the Death Star as it orbits Geonosis. =Official opening and subsequent changes= The attraction in Florida began soft openings on May 14, with the official opening at midnight on May 20, 2011. The attraction in Anaheim began soft openings on May 20, with the official opening in the morning of June 3, 2011. Tokyo Disneyland's Star Tours attraction closed on April 2, 2012, and reopened as the revamped attraction on May 7, 2013. Disneyland Paris' Star Tours attraction was the final incarnation to change; it closed on March 16, 2016, and reopened as The Adventures Continue on March 26, 2017. In 2012, Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue was awarded as the most \\"Outstanding Attraction Refresh\\" by the Themed Entertainment Association. At the 2015 D23 Expo, it was announced that a desert planet called Jakku from The Force Awakens would be added to the attraction. The new adventure became available beginning November 16, 2015. The mineral planet Crait from The Last Jedi and Batuu, the remote outpost forest and mountain planet from Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, were added to the attraction on November 17, 2017. The ocean moon Kef Bir from The Rise of Skywalker was added to the ride on December 20, 2019, the film's release date. Attraction File:Star Tours Space Port.jpg|Indoor queue. File:Endor set at Star Tours‚ÄìThe Adventures Continue.jpg|Exterior Endor forest village set in Florida. File:Tatooine Traders.jpg|The Tatooine Traders gift shop in Florida. The exteriors of all four Star Tours attractions are different in their respective parks. The attraction in Florida is inspired by an Ewok village on the forest moon of Endor, whereas the California, Japan, and France versions are modeled after a Tomorrowland-esque space port. =Backstory= According to the opening crawlYouTube video featuring the Opening Crawl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3amd_0yniQ8 that preceded the attraction's inaugural opening; after the Dark Times began, Captain Antilles had dispatched C-3PO and R2-D2, the series' protagonist droids who were placed in the custody of Antilles by order of Bail Organa near the end of Revenge of the Sith, to assist in the inauguration of the spaceline. The seemingly close relationship between the Rebel Alliance and the Star Tours agency, caused the Galactic Empire to believe that both entities were in a partnership, and thus has monitored the agency's actions over the years. =Queue= Similar to the functionality of the previous Star Tours attraction, The Adventures Continue places guests in the role of space tourists en route to a predetermined destination. The queue is designed to resemble a spaceport terminal: posters advertise voyages to different planets, and a large LCD screen informs riders of flight statuses, planetary weather forecasts, and advertisements promoting the benefits of booking flights with Star Tours. The screen displays information in spoken basic language and Aurebesh. The queue is populated with Audio-Animatronic characters, including C-3PO, R2-D2, and two Mon Calamari officers, that interact with one another and to guests. Entering the cargo bay, Captain Rex from the original attraction can be found, who in accordance with the timeline has not been used yet, and is therefore being sent back to a factory as defective. He occasionally has a power surge and delivers a line from the original attraction. Two G2 droids interact with guests as they conduct their tasks. The more outspoken droid processing the passengers' luggage on a scanning system reveals the luggages' contents to the guests waiting in the queue. Many references, gags, and in-jokes relating to Star Wars, Disney, and Pixar films are made via the contents of this luggage. Guests then retrieve their 3-D \\"flight glasses\\" and are directed by a flight agent to one of several concourses where they wait to board. =Pre-show= Television monitors show C-3PO, who has been assigned to maintenance on the StarSpeeder 1000 that guests are about to board, inadvertently getting trapped in the cockpit after the ship's captain leaves. Following this, Aly San San presents safety instructions to the guests. Once the doors to the StarSpeeder 1000 open, guests enter one of several ride simulators. After the doors close, C-3PO complains to R2-D2 (who is stationed on top of the ship) about the misunderstanding, but is ignored when the StarSpeeder 1000 begins to take flight with C-3PO in it. =Ride experience= Attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios Attraction at Disneyland The ride sequence is randomized; guests riding Star Tours will experience four out of 21 different segments during each journey. This gives Star Tours the advantage of being both highly repeatable and constantly surprising. Even though guests can experience different journeys, the main priority is always delivering a Rebel spy ‚Äî who is chosen from the guests on the ride vehicle and whose photo is displayed to all the riders ‚Äî to safety. There are 21 random segments of the film: four opening segments, five primary destination segments, seven hologram message segments, and five ending destination segments. Combined, they allow for 700 different possible ride experiences. * The StarSpeeder 1000 takes off, although C-3PO protests he is not the captain. As the StarSpeeder 1000 is about to leave the Star Tours terminal: *#Darth Vader, Imperial Stormtroopers, and Jumptroopers (this segment offers a random variant in which Boba Fett is among the group) arrive to arrest the Rebel spy aboard the StarSpeeder 1000. Vader uses a Force-grip to keep the StarSpeeder 1000 from escaping. The StarSpeeder 1000 fires its lasers at the Sith Lord, who deflects them with his lightsaber, allowing the shuttle to make a rapid exit backwards out of the hangar, with the Imperial TIE fighters chasing after it. The StarSpeeder 1000 then makes the jump to lightspeed. *# A variant of Segment 1, with First Order stormtroopers and Kylo Ren replacing Darth Vader. *# An Imperial probe droid attaches to the windshield and detects the presence of the Rebel spy on board the StarSpeeder 1000. At the same moment, Han Solo, facing detention by the Empire, opens fire on a platoon of Stormtroopers and races up the boarding ramp of the Millennium Falcon. The Falcon takes off and launches out of the hangar with the StarSpeeder 1000 in hot pursuit. After a few maneuvers, the Millennium Falcon jumps away, and the StarSpeeder 1000 shoots down a couple of TIE fighters, takes a few shots at a Star Destroyer, causing severe damage to the bridge, then jumps to lightspeed, despite C-3PO's protests. *# A variant of Segment 3, with a First Order probe droid and Rey in Han Solo's place against the First Order. * After jumping to lightspeed, the StarSpeeder arrives at its primary destination: *# The StarSpeeder 1000 almost crash lands on Hoth amid a battle between the Rebels' snowspeeders and Imperial AT-ATs. After entering the combat zone against orders, an AT-AT fires at the StarSpeeder 1000, and the ship crashes in the snow, teetering on the edge of a cliff. The ship falls over the side and rides through the canyon like a luge, launching off another cliff and free-falling into a deep canyon. At the last second, R2-D2 re-engages the engines and the StarSpeeder 1000 rockets back into space. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 reaches Tatooine and takes part in the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace, along with Sebulba and other Podracer pilots Teemto Pagalies, Ratts Tyerell, Gasgano, Ebe Endocott, and Mars Guo. Ratts Tyerell crashes into the canyon wall, causing the StarSpeeder 1000 to collide with Teemto Pagalies's Podracer, which gives the StarSpeeder 1000 twice the power. Sebulba throws a tool at the StarSpeeder 1000's windshield and the race concludes with the enhanced StarSpeeder 1000 overtaking Sebulba for 1st place, crossing the finish line and jettisoning the Podracer before flying back into space, narrowly missing the crowd. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 lands on Kashyyyk, as Scout Troopers riding on speeder bikes chase Chewbacca and a Wookiee warrior on an ornithopter through the lush forest. A Scout Trooper gets hit by a tree branch and the Wilhelm scream can be heard. At one point, Chewbacca falls off from the back of his vehicle and hits the StarSpeeder 1000's windshield. The StarSpeeder 1000 flies through the Wookiee villages on top of the lush forest trees and passes the flying Kashyyyk blue bird creature. A Wookiee warrior swings on the vines while doing the Tarzan yell through the villages. The StarSpeeder 1000 passes through the forest tree branches before blasting off into space. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 arrives on Jakku, where it follows the Millennium Falcon (piloted by Finn) as it is pursued by First Order TIE fighters over the desert landscape. The Millennium Falcon accidentally shoots the StarSpeeder 1000 with its turret, causing the StarSpeeder 1000 to crash-land in the remains of a destroyed Star Destroyer, where scavengers pry the Star Tours logo off the StarSpeeder 1000. The StarSpeeder 1000 finds a way out and takes off into space. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 arrives in the Endor system and incurs a water landing on Kef Bir, riding the turbulent surf into the wreckage of the second Death Star. After a brief entanglement with a Dianoga, the StarSpeeder 1000 manages to escape into space. * After the StarSpeeder 1000 returns to space, either Admiral Ackbar, Princess Leia, Yoda, Poe Dameron, Maz Kanata, BB-8, or Lando Calrissian transmits an urgent hologram message, relaying rendezvous coordinates to R2-D2. * Despite C-3PO's protests, R2-D2 takes the speeder to the location's coordinates: *# The StarSpeeder 1000 arrives in the upper atmosphere during the battle of Coruscant, where the last forces of the CIS are piloting droid tri-fighters while vulture droids battle the Republic Army's Clone troopers ARC-170 starfighters. Buzz droids from the vulture droid's missile are projected at the StarSpeeder 1000, which attach themselves to the windshield. R2-D2 uses an electric shock to blast them off, but some of the buzz droids have already caused severe damage to the stabilizers. The powerless StarSpeeder 1000 then plummets through the planet's atmosphere and into the bustling sky traffic of the city planet. After several near misses, the StarSpeeder 1000 careens to a halt on a landing platform, nearly hitting a fuel tanker before crashing into a traffic control droid. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 arrives during battle of Naboo. Naboo is under attack by the last Trade Federation control ship armies. Three N-1 Naboo starfighters are ordered to lead the StarSpeeder 1000 into a hangar bay, but are shot down by vulture droids. Another vulture droid shoots down the StarSpeeder 1000, causing it to plummet into the ocean. The StarSpeeder 1000 then arrives near Otoh Gunga, sideswiping or smashing into Jar Jar Binks. After the Gungans order the StarSpeeder 1000 to follow the Gungan Bongo that will lead it through the planet's core, an opee sea killer attacks the guide, but is then eaten by a sando aqua monster. As the guide escapes, a colo claw fish tries to eat the StarSpeeder 1000, but R2-D2 blasts it with an electric shock. The StarSpeeder 1000 then surfaces, skipping off the water and into a hangar filled with Starfighter debris. The StarSpeeder 1000 smashes into the tail of a Naboo starfighter, either shattering the windshield and angering the pit droid that falls into the cockpit, or merely breaking the tail of the starfighter, angering the pit droid, who then throws gold paint at the StarSpeeder 1000 and storms off. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 discovers the still-uncompleted Death Star orbiting Geonosis. Ambushed in the asteroid field by Boba Fett aboard Slave I, the StarSpeeder 1000 dodges laser fire and exploding asteroids before venturing into the Death Star. Escaping through a hangar bay, the StarSpeeder 1000 is confronted again by the bounty hunter. Fett launches a sonic bomb, which is deflected back by a laser blast from the StarSpeeder 1000. The explosion cripples the bounty hunter, allowing the StarSpeeder 1000 to jump to lightspeed. It reaches the Rebel fleet, and lands aboard a Mon Calamari cruiser, where Rebel Alliance leaders await to offer congratulations. *# The StarSpeeder 1000 arrives on Crait and gets chased by First Order TIE fighters before descending into the planet's crystal mines. Escaping the mines from the First Order TIE fighters, the StarSpeeder flies over the salt flats, joining Resistance forces in an attack on the First Order. The StarSpeeder 1000 is instructed by Poe Dameron to assist the Resistance in their siege against the First Order, led by General Hux's forces. A speeder passes in front of the StarSpeeder 1000 which causes the windshield to be covered in red salt before R2-D2 wipes it clean. General Hux questions Star Tours presence and instructs his fleet to destroy the ship. The StarSpeeder 1000 proceeds to destroy a First Order AT-AT before escaping into space. The StarSpeeder 1000 makes the jump to lightspeed and arrives on Batuu, touching down safely on the remote planet. *#With Lando's recruitment, the StarSpeeder 1000 arrives on Exegol to assist the Resistance in confronting Palpatine's Final Order armada. Led by General Dameron, the StarSpeeder 1000 engages in battle, successfully assisting in defeating the enemy forces. The StarSpeeder 1000 makes the jump to lightspeed, returning safely to the Star Tours terminal. Upon arrival, the StarSpeeder 1000's captain can be seen running towards the ship in anger. * C-3PO thanks the guests for choosing Star Tours as their space-line of choice and are then given disembarking instructions by Aly San San.

After evaluating the storyboards of the ride sequences, Williams determined that a newly written musical score was unnecessary. Instead, Williams suggested that the on-ride music should be the original cues from the films, along with unused passages from the film scores that he and his music editor found. Michael Giacchino provided additional arrangements of various Star Wars themes for use in the commercials and pre-show videos in the attraction. Also, the signature Star Tours logo chimes, composed by Richard Bellis, remained in the attraction. =Ride system= StarSpeeder 1000 flying in Coruscant The attraction combines high-definition video, a Dolby 3D high- definition screen, an improved motion simulator and several newly added special effects and Audio-animatronics. Similar to its predecessor, Star Tours‚ÄìThe Adventures Continue utilizes the same hydraulic motion base cabin, patented as Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator (ATLAS), which features several degrees of freedom, including the ability to move 35 degrees in the X-Y-Z plane. In the original version, passengers rode in a vehicle named the \\"StarSpeeder 3000\\". Since the new attraction is set before the original film, the new ride vehicle is referred to as a \\"StarSpeeder 1000\\". The motion simulator itself was originally manufactured by Rediffusion Simulation.

The name originates from the feudal Japanese assassin. It is commonly played at meet-ups and conventions.  Rules and gameplay  The rules of ninja are simple, and have only a few pivotal rules for play. In a game, players will stand in a circle, and place their hands together, the player leading the game will say \\"Dong Chi Qua!\\". There, the countdown begins, and each player must strike a pose. Players take turns attacking their opponents by swiping at their arms and hands, and must freeze in place once their attack is finished. Defending players may dodge if they think they will be hit, and must also freeze once the attack is finished. If a player is hit, the hand or arm that is hit is out but the other hand or arm is still in. If a player misses, they must stop moving immediately. When both hands have been hit, the player is out and must stand back until there is one player left. The only player left is the winner. However, there have been variations to how children play the game, some exercise optional rules such as, the area that is hit, timed attacks or however the players want to change the game. When the attacker is attacking, at least one foot must stay on the ground at all times.  Variations  A common \\"Circle Ninja\\" variant requires players to move in a clockwise motion rather than any direction they please. In \\"Ultimate Ninja\\", players position themselves in a circle and take turns in a clockwise motion. This variant however, adds the objective of slapping either the hands or the feet. The players are also able to dodge multiple attacks before their turn. Typically, ultimate ninja has players completing more complex maneuvers such as cartwheels, slide kicks, jump kicks and so on. Another variation specifies that players have only one life, that is, when one hand is hit, the player is considered out. Some games have a \\"lightning round\\" where two players attack each other and try to not stop until one is hit in the hand. The game is over when a player gets hit in the hand, stops the motion, or becomes confused during his or her turn. Many people play a rapid one-on-one variant where players must stand toe-to-toe throughout the game. In \\"Ninja Balance\\", players can only use one hand and the other is placed behind the back and can not touch anything. The right hands are bound together and the players can not move one foot which is planted outer ankle bone to toe. The players score a hit by touching any part of the opponent with their finger of the bound hand or when they cause the other player to lose balance and move their planted foot. Three hits is a win. Players are disqualified for causing injury or using the dead hand for anything but balance. Another variation includes the \\"instant death\\" rule. The most common version being when a player strikes another in the nose. Other locations such as the neck and forehead may also be used.

Very little asphalt concrete ‚Äî less than 1 percent, according to a survey by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association conducted annually since 2009 ‚Äî is actually disposed of in landfills. When asphalt pavement material is reclaimed for reuse, it is able to replace both virgin aggregates and virgin asphalt binder. Similarly, asphalt roof shingles can be recycled for use in new asphalt pavements. Concrete Glass American public glass waste collection point for separating clear, green and amber glass Glass bottles and jars are gathered by a curbside collection truck and bottle banks, where the glass may be sorted into color categories. The collected glass cullet is taken to a glass recycling plant where it is monitored for purity and contaminants are removed. The cullet is crushed and added to a raw material mix in a melting furnace. It is then mechanically blown or molded into new jars or bottles. Glass cullet is also used in the construction industry for aggregate and glassphalt. Glassphalt is a road-laying material which comprises around 30% recycled glass. Glass can be recycled indefinitely as its structure does not deteriorate when reprocessed. Metals =Aluminium= Aluminium is one of the most efficient and widely recycled materials.DRLP Fact SheetsEnvironmental Protection Agency Frequently Asked Questions about Recycling and Waste Management Aluminium is shredded and ground into small pieces or crushed into bales. These pieces or bales are melted in an aluminium smelter to produce molten aluminium. By this stage, the recycled aluminium is indistinguishable from virgin aluminium and further processing is identical for both. This process does not produce any change in the metal, so aluminium can be recycled indefinitely. Recycling aluminium saves 95% of the energy cost of processing new aluminium. This is because the temperature necessary for melting recycled, nearly pure, aluminium is 600 ¬∞C, while to extract mined aluminium from its ore requires 900 ¬∞C. To reach this higher temperature, much more energy is needed, leading to the high environmental benefits of aluminium recycling. Americans throw away enough aluminium every year to rebuild their entire commercial air fleet. Also, the energy saved by recycling one aluminium can is enough to run a television for three hours. =Copper= Like aluminium, copper is 100% recyclable without any loss of quality, regardless of whether it is in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. =Iron and steel= Steel crushed and baled for recycling. Iron and steel are the world's most recycled materials, and among the easiest materials to reprocess, as they can be separated magnetically from the waste stream. Recycling is via a steelworks: scrap is either remelted in an electric arc furnace (90-100% scrap), or used as part of the charge in a Basic Oxygen Furnace (around 25% scrap). Any grade of steel can be recycled to top quality new metal, with no 'downgrading' from prime to lower quality materials as steel is recycled repeatedly. 42% of crude steel produced is recycled material. =Other metals= For information about recycling other, less common metals, refer to: *Bismuth recycling *Lead recycling Plastic The vast majority of plastic is non-biodegradable, so recycling is a part of global efforts to reduce plastic in the waste stream. There are many types of plastic and they generally have to be separated by type for successful recycling. The low density of plastics increases transportation costs per unit weight. Timber A tidy stack of pallets awaits reuse or recycling. Recycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product, with consumers commonly believing that by purchasing recycled wood the demand for green timber will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Greenpeace also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website. The arrival of recycled timber as a construction product has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.

Early life  Robert Mohr was born in Bisterschied in the Palatinate in 1897 into the family of a Palatine-born master mason, one of six brothers and three sisters. Mohr completed an apprenticeship as a tailor, but never practiced this profession. He served in the German Army during the First World War and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class before resigning in May 1919. In October 1919, Mohr entered into the Bavarian police. In May 1933 he joined the Nazi Party. He also belonged to the National Socialist Motor Corps, the Reich Air Defense League, the Reich Colonial League and the National Socialist People's Welfare organisations. In the 1930s he worked as a police chief in Frankenthal (Pfalz). From 1938 he worked for the Gestapo in Munich.  The White Rose  Between 18 and 20 February 1943, Mohr interrogated Sophie Scholl and obtained her confession to the distribution of leaflets for the White Rose movement. In a 1951 report to Robert Scholl, Sophie's father, Mohr claimed that he tried to save Sophie's life by leading her to testify against her brother Hans Scholl, to say she was under his influence and that they had different opinions on politics.  Later life  After completion of the investigation into the White Rose, Mohr became chief of the Gestapo office in Mulhouse, occupied Alsace. Around 1947 he was interned by the French but was not tried for his service in the Gestapo. From 1948 he worked in the spa at Bad D√ºrkheim. He died in 1977 in Ludwigshafen.

It runs from north to south. It passes two provinces, namely Jakarta and West Java. At Cibadak, the route continues to Indonesian National Route 3 which is run on the south of Java. Routes Jakarta - Bogor - Ciawi - Benda - Cicurug - Parung Kuda - Cibadak =Description= Jakarta From a junction with the Route 1 and old Great Post Road in Grogol, West Jakarta, Route 2 runs concurrently with Jl. S. Parman southeastward, parallel with Grogol River until reaching Tomang Interchange some 1.5 km later. In this segment, the route passes many buildings and structures such as Ciputra Mall, Trisakti University, Tarumanagara University, Podomoro City, etc. Continuing 2.8 km southward, it interchanges with Route 12 leading for Bogor via Parung near MPR/DPR/DPD Complex, the highest legislative institution in Indonesia. The interchange also marks the complete entrance of the route into Central Jakarta, before entering South Jakarta two kilometers southeastward in Semanggi Interchange. Western railway line parallel with Route 12 passes underneath the route. Route 2 also passes near Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in this segment. Route 1 carried by Jl. Gatot Subroto. After leaving Semanggi Interchange, the route proceeds southeastward for approximately 4.5 km. In this segment, Route 2 is carried by Jl. Gatot Subroto, and has one interchange with Jl. HR. Rasuna Said. The route is then carried by Jl. MT. Haryono after passing Pancoran Flyover, where a statue is located nearby. Southern railway line underpasses the route some 1.5 km eastward. In this segment, Route 2 passes many important central business districts. After crossing over Ciliwung River located 400 m east, Route 2 enters East Jakarta. In Cawang Interchange, located 1.5 km east, Route 2 turns to the south, entering Jl. MayJend. Sutoyo near Universitas Kristen Indonesia. Cawang Interchange also becomes the terminal point of Route 13, JaGorAwi, and Jakarta‚ÄìCikampek Toll Roads. Most traffic between Jakarta and Bogor takes the toll road due to congestion often occurred in Route 2. From this interchange southward, Route 2 runs concurrently with Great Post Road built by Herman Willem Daendels and parallel with a waterwork. In Cililitan Junction, located two kilometers southward, the route proceeds to the south as Jl. Raya Bogor, passing through the subdistricts of Kramat Jati, Ciracas, and Pasar Rebo. Route 2 interchanges with Jakarta Outer Ring Road (Cinere-JaGorAwi segment) five kilometers southward. Upon leaving the interchange, Route 2 travels six kilometers before reaching West Java border located near Infantry Battalion 201. West Java In Depok City, the entire route initially runs in subdistrict of Cimanggis. Near Bayer Factory, located 2.3 km south of Jakarta‚ÄìWest Java border, the two sides of Route 2 are split up between Cimanggis in the eastern side and Sukmajaya in western side. That persists until reaching Cilodong Junction located 7.7 km southward, when the western side comes in Cibinong, seat of Bogor Regency, while the eastern side still belongs to Depok. Route 2 entirely enters Bogor Regency some two kilometers southward. Continuing 3.7 km south, it curves to the southwest after leaving Nanggewer Mekar village, and enters Bogor City after crossing over Ciluar River. Route 2 intersects with Bogor Outer Ring Road Toll located 2.5 km southwest of Bogor northern limit, after which its alignment is turns to north-south direction. After the intersection, Route 2 is carried by Jl. KS. Tubun for 580 m, then by Jl. Raya Pajajaran after Warung Jambu Junction. It then reaches the downtown some 3.5 kilometers southward. It is where Bogor's most prominent landmark, Bogor Botanical Gardens is located. Bogor Agricultural University (Baranangsiang campus) and Botani Square Mall are also located nearby. Not far from the landmarks, Route 2 intersects with Bogor Toll Plaza, located across Baranangsiang Bus Station, the largest bus station in Bogor. In Sukasari, located two kilometers southeastward, Route 12, running concurrently with Route 11 coming from Rangkasbitung, converges with Route 2. The junction marks the southern terminus of Route 12, but Route 11 doesn't, it runs concurrently with Route 2 instead. Route 2 is then carried by Jl. Raya Tajur for five kilometers. After Ciawi Junction, Route 2 turns to the south. The junction also serves as the southernmost terminus of JaGorAwi Toll Road and the divergent point of Route 2 and Route 11; the latter proceeds eastward to Cianjur via Puncak, following the path of Great Post Road. A three-way junction in Warungnangka hamlet marks the complete entrance of the route into Bogor Regency; the route is previously divided between Bogor Regency in eastern side and Bogor City in western side. After encountering a junction in Tapos, located 700 m southward, Route 2 curves to the southwest, passing through mountainous area as it stretches on the slopes of Mount Salak, Mount Gede, and Mount Pangrango. Route 2 turns southward in Caringin, located 3.3 km later. Route 2 curves to the southwest three kilometers later in Cisempur hamlet. It later overpasses Southern railway line in Cigombong 2.2 km later, near a three-way junction. Before that it passes near Lake Lido. Within one kilometer southward, Route 2 enters Sukabumi Regency. One kilometer later, the route curves to the west for one kilometer. It then proceeds south for 800 m, followed by a southwestward curving. It encounters a railway crossing in Cicurug some 2.8 km later. Continuing 9.5 km south via curvaceous path, it overpasses the railway line in Parung Kuda. Until reaching Downtown Cibadak, the railway still largely runs parallel with the route. After overcrossing Cicatih River some 9.5 km southeastwards, Route 2 merges with Route 3 coming from Pelabuhan Ratu, seat of Sukabumi Regency. Route 3 succeeds Route 2 in going into Sukabumi City.

Canseco served as Board President since 1995. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= Canseco at a campaign rally in San Antonio ;2004 Canseco ran for the newly redrawn Texas' 28th congressional district. In the Republican primary, he and attorney Jim Hopson qualified for a run-off election. Canseco got just 21% of the vote, while Hopson got 49% of the vote (barely missing the 50% threshold to win the primary). In the run-off election, Hopson defeated Canseco 65%‚Äì35%. ;2008 Canseco was defeated in the Republican primary by Bexar County Commissioner and former San Antonio city councilman Lyle Larson 62%‚Äì38%. ;2010 In the Republican primary, Canseco and CIA officer Will Hurd qualified for a run-off election; Hurd got 34%, while Canseco got 32%. In the run-off, Canseco defeated Hurd 53%‚Äì47%.Texas Secretary of State In the general election, Canseco faced incumbent Democratic congressman Ciro Rodriguez. The Republican National Committee gave strong financial support to Canseco in an effort to regain the seat for the Republicans. As of October 13, 2010, Rodriguez had raised more cash overall ($1,481,520 versus Canseco's $980,821), but Canseco had more cash on hand ($147,961 versus Rodriguez's $90,915). Canseco defeated Rodriguez 49%‚Äì44%. ;2012 Ciro Rodriguez filed for a rematch with Canseco in 2012, but he lost the Democratic primary to State Representative Pete Gallego, 55%‚Äì45%. In the November 6 general election, Gallego defeated Canseco 50%‚Äì46%. Two minor candidates held the remaining 4.1% of the ballots. The race was contested amid allegations of voter fraud and irregularities. On November 9, Canseco conceded to Gallego, citing the high costs and lengthy period of time required to contest the election. Although Canseco continued to allege numerous irregularities, he had concluded that \\"a full investigation and recount would be expensive and time-consuming,\\" considering that the 23rd District embraces all or parts of 29 counties.Gary Martin, \\"Canseco calls Gallego on Friday to concede race\\", Laredo Morning Times, November 10, 2012, p. 5A Canseco carried the district's portion of Bexar County, home to more than half the district's population. However, it was not enough to overcome Gallego's margins in the central and western portions of the district, which were virtually coextensive with Gallego's old state House district. Gallego also dominated the heavily Hispanic border areas. ;2014 In a bid to return to Congress, Canseco polled 10,204 votes (40.4%) in the Republican primary on March 4. He finished a close second to Will Hurd, his intraparty rival from 2010. Hurd, an African American, received 10,348 votes (49.9%). The remaining 4,723 votes (18.7%) went to a third candidate, Robert Lowry. In the May 27 runoff Hurd handily defeated Canseco, 8,698 (59.5%) to 5,924 (40.5%). Hurd faced freshman Democratic Representative Pete Gallego in the November 4 general election, and ultimately won. When Canseco ran for Congress in 2010, he obtained two loans totaling $88,000 from his family-owned enterprises. The money was taken from a bank account of a subsidiary company with an address in Mexico. He also provided $86,000 in his own funds as a campaign loan. As Canseco ran in 2014, federal regulators were auditing his campaign funds to see if they were in violation of restrictions on corporate contributions and a longstanding ban on political donations made by foreign nationals, corporations, partnerships, and associations.Kevin Diaz of The Houston Chronicle, \\"Texas's 23rd Congressional District: Feds audit Canseco's campaign finances\\", Laredo Morning Times, May 2, 2014, pp. 1, 10A ;2018 In another bid to return to Congress, Canseco ran in the 18-way Republican primary for Texas's 21st congressional district to succeed the retiring incumbent Republican Lamar Smith.http://herald- zeitung.com/article_f72d4ed0-1c1f-11e8-9ddb-d38ec48e53b4.html He was ultimately unsuccessful, garnering less than 5% of the vote.https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-house- district-21-primary-election =Tenure= Canseco describes himself as a \\"limited-government conservative.\\"Bio page on campaign site . He supports the Arizona immigration law. He supports the extension of the Bush tax cuts and repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the campaign, Canseco openly identified with the Tea Party movement. Canseco was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans. During his tenure, he was one of four voting Latino members of Congress known to be a member of the RSC, the others being Bill Flores of Texas, Raul Labrador of Idaho and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. He was also a member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference. In 2012, Canseco delivered the Spanish language version of the Republican response to the State of the Union address. In summer 2011, Canseco was criticized after initially declining to introduce a bill allowing for a swap of land between the Federal Government and Bexar County, Texas. The bill, which was supported by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and sponsored by retiring Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Senate, would expand the development of the San Antonio River to the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. In October 2011, Canseco introduced the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act in the House, which mirrored Hutchison's Senate bill. The legislation would cost roughly $4 million over four years, even though the lands would be donated. In April 2012, Canseco traveled using the San Antonio International Airport. He said that he was assaulted by the Transportation Security Administration when an officer \\"was patting me down where no one is supposed to go.\\" The TSA officer said that he was assaulted by Canseco, but no arrests were made. Canseco advocates for changes in security procedures.

He was credited with thirteen confirmed aerial victories. Postwar, Joseph moved into engineering and manufacturing. He acquired components of New Imperial Motors upon its dissolution in 1939, and produced aircraft parts for the British war effort of World War II. After World War II, he turned his company's manufacturing to agricultural machinery. Early life Solomon Clifford Joseph was born in Birmingham on 29 April 1893. World War I Joseph joined the RNAS in August 1917.Shores et.al. (1990), p. 219. He trained as a pilot, receiving Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 5475 on a Caudron biplane at the British Flying School at Vend√¥me, France, on 7 October, and was commissioned as a temporary flight sub-lieutenant on 2 December. He was first assigned to No. 12 Squadron RNAS, but was transferred to No. 10 Squadron RNAS in February 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. He scored his first aerial victory on 7 May 1918, and continued to string out a dozen wins stretching through 3 September 1918; he teamed up to share victories with such fellow aces as Alfred Williams Carter and Clement W. Payton in several cases. On 10 August he was appointed a flight commander, with its accompanying temporary promotion to captain. On 21 September, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Three days later, he was wounded in action. He recovered in time to round off his victory string with a final win on 30 October 1918. Three days later, he was granted a Bar to his DFC in lieu of a second award. In the final analysis, Joseph had destroyed five enemy aircraft by himself, shared in destroying two others, drove three down out of control, and teamed up to drive another one down out of combat. He also was a balloon buster, being one of three pilots responsible for destroying a German observation balloon. On 4 April 1919, Joseph was transferred to the Royal Air Force's unemployed list. Postwar career Joseph returned to Birmingham to pursue a career in the engineering sector. On 17 November 1925 the partnership between Joseph and two others in the Tyseley Munitions Works, operating as breakers down of service ammunition and fuses, was dissolved. In early 1939 Simpson bought the assets of the bankrupt New Imperial Motors motorcycle company, which become part of his Clifford Aero & Auto Ltd. group, and produced components for Lancaster and Spitfire aircraft during the war. Post war, under the name of Clifford Cultivators Ltd., he produced rotary cultivators from 1946 to 1959, as well as hand and power pumps, electric washing machines, and fork lift trucks, while his company Clifford Covering Ltd. manufactured steering wheels. Clifford Aero & Auto was wound up in 1976.

It was written by Ryan Murphy, from a story by Murphy and Tim Wollaston, directed by Adam Shankman, and premiered on Fox on October 26, 2010. The episode features the glee club paying tribute to the 1973 musical The Rocky Horror Show, with elements of its 1975 film adaptation The Rocky Horror Picture Show, by staging it as a school musical. While cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) attempts to sabotage the production, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) dwells on his feelings for guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), and club members Finn (Cory Monteith) and Sam (Chord Overstreet) deal with body image issues. Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf, who star in the original film, appear in cameo roles in this episode. Elements of Rocky Horror were sanitized for the episode, including the costumes and lyrics. Creator Richard O'Brien expressed disappointment in the dilution of the musical's themes, and a spokesperson for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation criticized the episode for its use of the term \\"tranny\\". Watched by 11.76 million US viewers, \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" was the fifth consecutive episode of Glee to become the top-rated program on the night of broadcast in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It received a mixed response from critics, was alternatively deemed the series' best ever themed-episode by Rolling Stone Erica Futterman, and was described as the worst hour in the show's history by Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club. The episode featured cover versions of seven Rocky Horror songs, which were released on an extended play album. Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show reached number six on the Billboard 200. It marked the lowest debut and sales for the Glee cast in the US, but the highest position ever reached for a Rocky Horror album. The songs attracted mixed commentary, particularly the performance of \\"Time Warp\\", which was given a grade of \\"A+\\" by Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack, but derided by Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine as \\"very possibly the weakest, most uninspired rendition\\" he had ever heard. Plot The episode opens with the red lips of glee club member Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) against a black background as she sings \\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\\". In the school auditorium, the glee club members rehearse The Rocky Horror Show, performing \\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\\". They are interrupted by Dr. Carl Howell (John Stamos), who accuses club director Will Schuester of trying to steal his girlfriend, school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury. The episode continues in flashback format, with Will recalling the events leading up to Carl's accusation. Will learns that Emma and Carl attended a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which helped to lessen some of her obsessive‚Äìcompulsive behaviors. As Emma is a fan, Will decides to direct the glee club in a production of the musical, casting co-captains Finn Hudson and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) in the lead roles of Brad and Janet, Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) as Dr. Frank N. Furter, and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) as Rocky. While Sam is proud of his physique and secure in his own body-image, Finn feels self-conscious at the prospect of appearing in his underwear, as the role necessitates. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester is approached by news station managers Tim Stanwick (Barry Bostwick) and Barry Jeffries (Meat Loaf) about producing an undercover expos√© of the play, and convinces Will to involve her in the production. When Mike's parents refuse to let him play Frank N. Furter, a transvestite, Sue manipulates Carl into saving the musical. He auditions with the song \\"Hot Patootie\\", but feels that it would be more appropriate for him to play Eddie. The role of Frank, traditionally played by a male, is instead claimed by Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley). Will grows increasingly jealous of Carl as he joins the production. When Sam becomes hesitant to wear his skimpy costume, Will decides that he will play Rocky instead, and asks Emma to rehearse the suggestive \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" with him. Will is later called into Principal Figgins' (Iqbal Theba) office, where he learns that Finn has been suspended for walking through the hallway in his underwear, attempting to become comfortable with his costume. He convinces Figgins to reduce Finn's punishment, and the episode returns to the opening scene as Carl confronts Will over his private rehearsal with Emma. Alerted to Sue's planned expos√©, Will concedes that his motivations in putting on the production were questionable. He tells Emma that he will cease interfering with her relationship. Though he cancels the play, he has the glee club perform it for themselves, and the episode ends with a group rendition of \\"Time Warp\\". Production When casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy required that auditioning actors without theatrical experience demonstrate their ability to sing and dance as well as act. Mays, who was cast as guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury, auditioned with the song \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In April 2009, Murphy told the Los Angeles Times that he would like to have Mays perform the song on Glee. In October 2009, cast member Chris Colfer deemed \\"Time Warp\\" the song he would most like to perform on the show, and suggested a Rocky Horror-themed Halloween episode. Colfer re-iterated his desire to perform \\"Time Warp\\" at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, which prompted Murphy to reveal that a Glee episode devoted to Rocky Horror was planned for the show's second season. At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated he would be directing the episode, and also revealed that Adam Shankman would guest-direct one of the first ten episodes of the season. Shankman later revealed via the social networking website Twitter that he would in fact be directing the Rocky Horror episode, and commented, \\"Rocky Horror, while really risqu√©, is perfect for Glee because they all, in theory, feel like misfits.\\" Elements of Rocky Horror were sanitized for the episode, and Shankman believes that he was sought out in order to make the production more audience appropriate. Stamos was initially set to play Dr. Frank N. Furter, but the role was recast due to network resistance. Costumes used in the episode were inspired by the Rocky Horror musical and film, but were adapted for the Glee cast and cost over $30,000. The tight gold lam√© underwear worn by Peter Hinwood in the 1975 film were replaced by board shorts for Overstreet. In dressing Riley as Frank, series costume designer Lou Eyrich found it challenging to select outfits which would be acceptable for a primetime series, yet would still appeal to all audiences. To appeal to younger viewers, Eyrich updated the costume worn by Colfer as Riff Raff, pairing a tailcoat with jeans and a J.Crew henley shirt. Michele's costuming as Janet was similar to her regular wardrobe as Rachel, with Eyrich commenting, \\"That's why she was the perfect Janet.\\" Prior to broadcast, cast member Mark Salling claimed that he would play Rocky Horror talking lips. In the event, however, Salling did not appear in the episode. He was temporarily absent from the series, reportedly for creative reasons, and returned in November 2010. The lips were instead played by Rivera. Original Rocky Horror cast members Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf guest-starred in the episode. Bostwick deemed their roles \\"stunt casting\\", but suggested his character may return to the show in future and become involved with Sue. Susan Sarandon told People she was open to appearing in the episode depending on the role, and stated that she was flattered by the planned Glee tribute, but was not approached about appearing. An advance midnight screening of the episode was previewed on October 21, 2010 at the Angelika Film Center in New York City. Reception =Ratings= In its original broadcast, \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" was watched by 11.76 million US viewers and attained a 4.9/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For the fifth consecutive episode, Glee was the top-rated program of the night among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Both viewership and ratings rose from the previous episode, \\"Duets\\", which was watched by 11.36 million viewers and attained a 4.7/13 rating/share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. In the weekly program rankings, Glee was the fifth most-viewed show among adults 18‚Äì49, and the second scripted show behind only Modern Family. In overall viewers, it placed twentieth for the week. In Canada, the episode was watched by 2.48 million viewers, ranking as the fourth most-watched program for the week of broadcast. Viewership was again up on \\"Duets\\", which attained 2.25 million viewers and ranked seventh. The episode's Australian broadcast drew 1.34 million viewers, making Glee the fifth most-watched show of the night and the most-watched with viewers aged under 50. It placed eleventh in the weekly program rankings. There also, \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" registered a rise on the previous episode, which was watched by 1.04 million viewers, placed ninth on the night and twenty-eighth for the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.50 million viewers‚Äî2.121 million on E4, and 385,000 on E4+1‚Äîbecoming the most- watched show on cable for the week. Viewership remained static from \\"Duets\\", which also attained an audience of 2.50 million. =Critical response= Rocky Horror creator Richard O'Brien (pictured) expressed disappointment with the episode's sanitization. Rocky Horror creator Richard O'Brien was disappointed that the episode diluted the themes of the musical, and was puzzled that the word \\"transsexual\\" was censored. Matt Kane, entertainment media manager for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, criticized the use of the pejorative term \\"tranny\\" in its place, and found it \\"particularly alarming\\" given that the season one episode \\"Theatricality\\" presented a negative reaction to the use of a homophobic slur.\\" Critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded it an \\"F\\" and said it was \\"the worst hour this show has ever produced\\". She felt that it was overly ambitious, and that in attempting to skirt humorously around the issue of transsexuals, the end result was \\"more offensive than if the show had simply ignored the whole thing to begin with.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine called it a \\"travesty\\" and criticized \\"the arms-length treatment of the Frank N. Furter character\\", and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times deemed the episode flawed through its sanitization, despite initially having found the two shows \\"a particularly promising match\\". \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" received several favorable comparisons to previous themed episodes; Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone deemed it the best yet. Both Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post preferred it to the Britney Spears tribute episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\"; Wieselman hailed it as a \\"run-away success\\" that would satisfy Rocky Horror fans without being a \\"homage for homage's sake\\" like the Spears episode, and Stack felt that Rocky Horror was a \\"perfect fit\\" for Glee, due to thematic similarities between the two. While previous Glee tributes attracted criticism for their focus on musical numbers to the detriment of plot, Jenna Mullins of E! Online and CBS News Jessica Derschowitz appreciated that \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" was more story-driven. Critics generally disliked the focus the episode placed on the adult characters, with many objecting to Will's characterisation. VanDerWerff wrote that his storyline with Emma \\"misplac[ed] what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place\\", and IGN's Robert Canning‚Äîwho otherwise enjoyed the episode, and rated it 8.5/10‚Äîobserved that Will was presented as being selfish and a \\"terrible educator\\", in contrast to his former role as the moral centre of the show. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post initially found the focus on the adults a welcome change, but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed, and deemed it overall, \\"Creepy, vaguely uncomfortable, in slightly poor taste but well-intentioned, and ultimately, thoroughly entertaining to watch for reasons I can't quite put into words.\\" CNN's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma, as well as Finn and his body image issues. While Stack commended the male body image storyline, and found it refreshing for a program to examine the objectification of men, de Moraes derided it, and likened Finn and Sam's discussion about eating healthily and working out to an \\"after school special\\". The episode's conclusion‚Äîin which Will declares that the original Rocky Horror fans and New Directions members are united by their outcast status‚Äîwas widely criticized, with VanDerWerff deeming it a \\"series lowpoint\\", and \\"a muddled, terrible message, particularly in an episode that seems to have an uneasy relationship with actual outcasts, transsexuals.\\" Both Reiter and Aly Semigran of MTV questioned the resolution, with Reiter stating that it was unclear what message the creators were attempting to convey, and Semigran finding it disjointed, suggesting \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" to be a \\"rare Glee misstep\\". Music =Performances= Seven Rocky Horror songs were covered in the episode. The opening number of \\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\\", performed by Rivera and represented by a disembodied pair of red lips, mirrored the opening to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The song segued into a rehearsal of \\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\\", which was followed by a rehearsal of \\"Dammit Janet\\"‚Äîthe former with Michele on lead vocals, and the latter featuring Michele, Monteith, Colfer, Agron and Riley. Stamos' first vocal performance for the series followed, as he gave a rendition of \\"Hot Patootie\\". Stamos reportedly feigned illness in order to work with a private vocal coach and dance instructor on the number, and hired his own studio in which to rehearse. The performance entailed a shot-by-shot recreation of the original choreography. \\"Sweet Transvestite\\" featured Riley on lead vocals, and \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" showcased Mays, in her first lead performance since \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" in season one. The episode then closed with a group rendition of \\"Time Warp\\". =Commentary= Musical performances in the episode attracted mixed commentary, particularly \\"Time Warp\\". Stack rated all of the songs a \\"B\\" grade or higher, and gave \\"Time Warp\\" the highest grade of an \\"A+\\". He called it his favorite moment of the episode, and praised its energy; he wrote that Quinn made a \\"surprisingly good\\" Magenta. Semigran also praised the number, and commended the performances by Morris, Monteith, Agron and particularly Colfer, who, she wrote, \\"looked and sounded the part so well, you'd swear you were watching the original Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". In a generally negative review of the episode, Reiter commented that despite her dissatisfaction, she found herself singing along to \\"Time Warp\\" with \\"disconcerting enthusiasm\\", and was \\"nostalgically transported against [her] better judgment\\". In contrast, VanDerWerff stated that she would have increased her review of the episode from an \\"F\\" to a \\"D\\" had \\"Time Warp\\" been better, as she had \\"never seen a more lifeless version\\". Zoller Seitz similarly called it \\"very possibly the weakest, most uninspired rendition\\" he had ever seen, and criticized the side- lining of Colfer in favor of Monteith. Semigran said the song \\"Dammit Janet\\" was \\"spirited and spot-on\\", and Benigno graded it an \\"A\\", though observed that it was \\"painfully obvious\\" Michele and Monteith were lip-syncing. Futterman described the performance as \\"fully engaged, campy to the max and totally on point\\". \\"Hot Patootie\\" resulted in praise for Stamos, with Stack grading it an \\"A\\" and comparing it favorably to the actor's singing on Full House, and Semigran recommending that he be cast in a Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Show. Benigno wrote that his voice lacked Meat Loaf's \\"rock n' roll howl\\", but praised his charisma and dancing, and graded the performance an Critics disagreed over the casting of Mercedes as Frank. Semigran felt that, as sung by a female, \\"Sweet Transvestite\\" lost its shock value. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal would have preferred Salling's Puck in the role, but praised Riley's vocals, writing that her solo \\"woke us all up from the timid pacing\\". Benigno also enjoyed the number, and found that while Mercedes lacked the stage presence of Tim Curry, Riley did something \\"completely remarkable\\" as Frank, giving a largely flawless performance. He named \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" the best song of the episode, and graded it \\"A+\\". Despite finding the episode \\"abrupt, uneven [and] sanitized\\", Flandez felt that it was saved by this performance. Futterman remarked that having Emma in the role of Janet was \\"ideal\\", but preferred the song visually to vocally. Zoller Seitz disliked the change in Emma's characterization which brought about the number, and while he wrote that \\"Mays was so charming that she almost, almost saved it\\", he ultimately found the \\"motivational contortions\\" insulting to the audience. =Chart history= Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show, an extended play accompanying the episode, was released on October 19, 2010. Its track list includes each of the seven songs covered. The soundtrack debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, with 48,000 copies sold. It marked the lowest debut and sales for the Glee cast in the US, but the highest position ever reached for a Rocky Horror album. The EP attained lower chart positions internationally, peaking at number eight in Australia, ten in Canada, fifteen in Ireland, and twenty-three in the UK. \\"Time Warp\\" was the only song from the EP to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, attaining a position of eighty-nine. Internationally, its highest peak was in Ireland, where it reached number forty-two. \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\\" was the only other track from the EP to place on the singles charts, peaking at number seventy-two in the UK.

It is used in biological pest control of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) in cucumberCucumeris designates the species as \\"of cucumbers\\". and some other greenhouse crops. Description The mite has a pear-shaped translucent pinkish or tan-coloured body (depending on what it has most recently been feeding on) and grows to a length of between . It varies in morphology over its wide range and has been described numerous times under different names, and it is very difficult to distinguish it from other species of predatory mite. Biology Eggs of N. cucumeris are oval, white and translucent. They are laid on leaves, on hairs on the veins on the underside of leaves or in domatia. They hatch after about three days into non- feeding larvae which then pass through two nymphal stages before becoming adult. The development time from egg to adult is about eleven days at . Adult mites live for four to five weeks during which time females each lay about 35 eggs. This species is an aggressive predator and will feed on the immature stages of western flower thrips, common blossom thrips, onion thrips, melon thrips and chilli thrips, as well as the silverleaf whitefly and Asian citrus psyllid, and several plant-damaging mites. It is most successful with prey feeding on foliage, and less so with those in blossoms. Where there is more than one prey species present, it will tend to concentrate on the easiest one to find. For example, in a 2016 research project on cucumber plants, it was successful in controlling melon thrips on the leaves, but not common blossom thrips on the flowers. In the absence of suitable prey species, this mite can survive and reproduce while feeding on pollen, although survival rates, longevity and fecundity are all superior when prey is included in the diet. Use in biocontrol N. cucumeris has been used under glass in biocontrol of thrips, whitefly, psyllids, aphids and mites. It is widely available commercially and can be distributed round the crop in sachets suspended from the host plants. These contain the mite mixed with bran, accompanied by bran mites, as a temporary food source. As the predatory mite most widely used in biological control of thrips, N. cucumeris has produced excellent results in plants with pollen, such as the sweet pepper. It has the advantage that it is easy to maintain and rear. However it is much less effective in modern cucumbers which are a parthenocarpic crop which does not produce pollen.

It is affiliated with the World Assemblies of God Fellowship. The headquarters in Metro Manila. History The first missionary of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America to work in the Philippines was Benjamin H. Caudle and his wife who arrived in 1926.Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 131 However, due to his wife's illness, Caudle was forced to return to the U.S. In the 1930s, Filipinos who had graduated from Assemblies of God Bible schools began requesting that the denomination send an appointed missionary to organize the church there. At the time, the Philippines were a U.S. protectorate, and legally, the AG needed a missionary appointed by the U.S. body to be registered as a religious organization. In December 1939, the Assemblies of God USA responded by sending a missionary, Leland E. Johnson, to organize and superintend the Philippines District Council of the Assemblies of God. The first convention was held in March 1940 at Villasis, Pangasinan, and the Council was incorporated in July.Seleky, 273. Other missionaries would arrive, especially from China as conflict with Japan escalated. In 1941, Bethel Bible Institute was opened in Baguio to train pastors and evangelists.Seleky, 275. During World War II, Japanese military forces occupied the Philippines. The Bible institute, like all schools, was closed, and the missionaries were interned. During these years, the district was led entirely by Filipinos. After the war, the missionary presence was revived and Bethel Bible Institute was reopened. Immanuel Bible Institute in Cebu City was founded in 1951, and in 1953, Bethesda Children's Home was founded by Elva Vanderbout, a missionary to the Igorots of the Mountain Province in Northern Luzon.Seleky, 279-280.

Building and construction waste =Aggregates and concrete= Concrete blocks in Germany. Concrete aggregate collected from demolition sites is put through a crushing machine, often along with asphalt, bricks, dirt, and rocks. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. Crushed recycled concrete can also be used as the dry aggregate for new concrete if it is free of contaminants. Builder's rubble (like broken down bricks) is also used for railway ballast and gravel paths. This reduces the need for other rocks to be dug up, which in turn saves trees and habitats. =Asphalt and tarmac= Asphalt including asphalt shingle can be melted down and in part recycled. Tarmac can also recycled and there is now an active market for recycling tarmac in the developed world.Netregs - Guidance on Roadstone coating processes This includes tarmac scalpings produced when roads are scarified before a new surface is laid. =Gypsum, plaster and plasterboard products= Because up to 17% of gypsum products are wasted during the manufacturing and installation processes. Wallboard (Australia and others), plasterboard, Gyp (New Zealand), drywall (USA) or plasterboard (UK and Ireland) is frequently not re-used and disposal can become a problem. Some landfill sites have banned dumping of gypsum because of the tendency to produce large volumes of hydrogen sulfide gas. Some manufacturers take back waste wallboards from construction sites and recycle it into new wallboard.Plasterboard recycling Gypsum waste from new construction, demolition and refurbishment activities can be turned into recycled gypsum through mechanical processes, and the recycled gypsum obtained can replace virgin gypsum in the Gypsum Industry. Some of the reasons for recycling this waste are: * Gypsum is one of the few construction materials for which closed loop recycling is possible.EUROGYPSUM, Environmental and Raw Material Committee. Factsheet on: What is gypsum? Retrieved 16 December 2013. * Closed loop gypsum recycling saves virgin gypsum resources. * According to the European Directive 2008/98/EC on Waste,The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union. Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (Waste Framework Directive). Official Journal L 312 , 22/11/2008 P. 0003 - 0030. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0098:EN:NOT Retrieved 16 December 2013. recycling should be preferred to recovery and landfill disposal. * This Directive also establishes that the preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery of non-hazardous Construction and Demolition (C&D;) waste (excluding soil and stones other that those containing dangerous substances) have to be increased to a minimum of 70% by weight by 2020. * The disposal of gypsum-based materials can become a problem if they are accepted at normal cells in non-hazardous landfills, as the sulphate content of gypsum mixed with organic waste can break down under certain conditions into hydrogen sulfide gas. * =Bricks= Intact bricks recovered from demolition can be cleaned and re-used. Batteries Some batteries contain toxic heavy metals, making recycling or proper disposal a high priority. These batteries are Dutch; the Netherlands openly encourages battery recycling. The large variation in size and type of batteries makes their recycling extremely difficult: they must first be sorted into similar kinds and each kind requires an individual recycling process. Additionally, older batteries contain mercury and cadmium, harmful materials that must be handled with care. Because of their potential environmental damage, proper disposal of used batteries is required by law in many areas. Unfortunately, this mandate has been difficult to enforce. Lead-acid batteries, like those used in automobiles, are relatively easy to recycle and many regions have legislation requiring vendors to accept used products. In the United States, the recycling rate is 90%, with new batteries containing up to 80% recycled material. Japan, Kuwait, the USA, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, the UK and Ireland all actively encourage battery recycling programs. In 2006, the EU passed the Battery Directive of which one of the aims is a higher rate of battery recycling. The EU directive said at least 25% of all the EU's used batteries must be collected by 2012, and rising to no less than 45% by 2016, of which, that at least 50% of them must be recycled. Biodegradable waste Kitchen, garden, and other green waste can be recycled into useful material by composting into leaf mold and regular compost. This process allows natural aerobic bacteria to break down the waste into fertile topsoil. Much composting is done on a household scale, but municipal green- waste collection programs also exist. These programs can supplement their funding by selling the topsoil produced. Electronic waste =Electronics disassembly and reclamation= An abandoned computer monitor in Denton, Texas. Electronic recycling is recycling or reuse of computers or other electronics. It includes both finding another use for materials (such as donation to charity), and having systems dismantled in a manner that allows for the safe extraction of the constituent materials for reuse in other products. The direct disposal of electrical equipment‚Äîsuch as old computers and mobile phones is banned in many areas, such as the UK, parts of the USA, Japan, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, due to the toxic contents of certain components. The recycling process works by mechanically separating the metals, plastics, and circuit boards contained in the appliance. When this is done on a large scale at an electronic waste recycling plant, component recovery can be achieved cost-effectively. With high lead content in CRTs, and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which (LCDs) use lamps containing mercury, there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions. Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers and scrap dealers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing electrical energy requirements. Computers that are termed trashware in North America or totally reconditioned hardware in the UK and Ireland are computer equipment that has assembled from old hardware, using cleaned and checked parts from different computers, for use by disadvantaged people to bridge the digital divide. Trashware is different from retrocomputing, which has only cultural and recreational purposes. =Ink jet printer cartridges= Resetting an Epson ink cartridge using a resetter tool. Because printer cartridges from the original manufacturer are often expensive, demand exists for cheaper third party options. These include ink sold in bulk, cartridge refill kits, machines in stores that automatically refill cartridges, re-manufactured cartridges, and cartridges made by a corporate entity other than the original manufacturer. Consumers can refill ink cartridges themselves with a kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or re-manufacturer where ink is pumped back into the cartridge. PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and colour bleed. Metals A wide range of metals in commercial and domestic use have well developed recycling markets in most developed countries. Domestic recycling is commonly available for IronMetals - aluminium and steel recycling and steel, aluminium and in particular beverage and food cans. In addition, building metals such as copper,Recycling of Copper zincZinc recycling and leadLead recycling are readily recyclable through specialised companies. In the UK, these are usually either specialised scrap dealers or car breakers. Other metals present in smaller quantities in the domestic waste stream such as tinTin recycling and chromium are also extracted from metal put into the recycling system but are rarely recovered from the general waste stream. Paint Paper and newsprint Waste paper collected for recycling in Ponte a Serraglio, near Bagni di Lucca, Italy. Paper and newsprint can be recycled by reducing it to pulp and combining it with pulp from newly harvested wood. As the recycling process causes the paper fibres to break down, each time paper is recycled its quality decreases. This means that either a higher percentage of new fibres must be added, or the paper down- cycled into lower quality products. Any writing or colouration of the paper must first be removed by deinking, which also removes fillers, clays, and fibre fragments. Almost all paper can be recycled today, but some types are harder to recycle than others. Papers coated with plastic or aluminium foil, and papers that are waxed, pasted, or gummed are usually not recycled because the process is too expensive. Sometimes recyclers ask for the removal of the glossy paper inserts from newspapers because they are a different type of paper. Glossy inserts have a heavy clay coating that some paper mills cannot accept. Most of the clay is removed from the recycled pulp as sludge, which must be disposed of. If the coated paper is 20% by weight clay, then each ton of glossy paper produces more than 200 kg of sludge and less than 800 kg of fibre. The price of recycled paper has varied greatly over the last 30 or so years. http://www.wildaboutbritain.co.uk/forums/waste-recycling-and- pollution/46521-paper-recycling-crisis.html The German price of ‚Ç¨100/¬£49 per tonne was typical for the year 2003 and it steadily rose over the years. By the September 2008 saw the American price of $235 per ton, which had fallen to just $120 per ton, and in the January 2009, the UK's fell six weeks from about ¬£70.00 per ton, to only ¬£10.00 per ton. The slump was probably due to the economic down turn in East Asia leading to market for waste paper drying up in China. 2010 averaged at $120.32 over the start of the year, but saw a rapid rise global prices in May 2010, with the June 2010 resting $217.11 per ton in the USA as China's paper market began to reopen! Mexico, America, the EU, Russia and Japan all recycle paper en masse and there are many state run and private schemes running in those countries. In 2004 the paper recycling rate in Europe was 54.6% or . The recycling rate in Europe reached 64.5%3 in 2007, which confirms that the industry is on the path to meeting its voluntary target of 66% by 2010. Plastic Plastic shipping crates in Italian recycling plant. Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the material into useful products. Compared to glass or metallic materials, plastic poses unique challenges. Because of the massive number of types of plastic, they each carry a resin identification code, and must be sorted before they can be recycled. This can be costly; while metals can be sorted using electromagnets, no such 'easy sorting' capability exists for plastics. In addition to this, while labels do not need to be removed from bottles for recycling, lids are often made from a different kind of non- recyclable plastic. To help in identifying the materials in various plastic items, resin identification code numbers 1-6 have been assigned to six common kinds of recyclable plastic resins, with the number 7 indicating any other kind of plastic, whether recyclable or not. Standardized symbols are available incorporating each of these resin codes. Rubber Tires Tyres, these ones which were illegally dumped in France, are among the largest and most problematic sources of waste. Tire recycling or rubber recycling is the process of recycling vehicles tyres that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles. These tyres are among the largest and most problematic sources of waste, due to the large volume produced and their durability. Those same characteristics which make waste tyres such a problem also make them one of the most re-used waste materials, as the rubber is very resilient and can be reused in other products. In the United States, approximately one tyre is discarded per person per year. However, material recovered from waste tyres, known as \\"crumb\\" is generally only a cheap \\"filler\\" material and is rarely used in high volumes. Tyre recycling is also fairly common. Used tires can be added to asphalt for producing road surfaces or to make rubber mulch used on playgrounds, basketball courts and new shoe products. They are also often used as the insulation and heat absorbing/releasing material in specially constructed homes known as earthships. It is arguable that tire crumb in applications such as basketball courts could be better described as \\"reused\\" rubber rather than \\"recycled\\". Ship breaking  A 30- to 40-year-old general cargo ship anchored off Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, before being broken up. Ship breaking is a type of ship disposal involving breaking up ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused. Equipment on board the vessel can also be reused. Until the late 20th century, ship breaking took place in port cities of industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Today, most ship breaking yards are in Alang in India, Chittagong in Bangladesh, Aliaƒüa in Turkey and Gadani near Karachi in Pakistan. Ship breaking is one example that has associated environmental, health, and safety risks for the area where the operation takes place; balancing all these considerations is an environmental justice problem. Textiles In many countries, there is an active market in re-selling used clothes. In Britain, this dominated by charity shops who sell donated clean clothes. Less saleable clothes are put into the re-cycling waste stream. Textiles are made of a variety of materials including cotton, wool, synthetic plastics, linen, modal and a variety of other materials. The textile's composition will affect its durability and method of recycling. Textiles entering the re-cycling stream are sorted and separated by workers into good quality clothing and shoes which can be reused or worn. There is a trend of moving these facilities from developed countries to developing countries either for charity or sold at a cheaper price. Many international organisations collect used textiles from developed countries as a donation to those third world countries. This recycling practise is encouraged because it helps to reduce unwanted waste while providing clothing to those in need. Damaged textiles are further sorted into grades to make industrial wiping cloths and for use in high quality paper manufacture or material suitable for fibre reclamation and filling products. If textile reprocessors receive wet or soiled clothes, however, these may still be disposed of in a landfill, as the washing and drying facilities may not be present at sorting units. Fibre reclamation mills sort textiles according to fibre type and colour. Colour sorting eliminates the need to re- dye the recycled textiles. The textiles are shredded into \\"shoddy\\" fibres and blended with other selected fibres, depending on the intended end use of the recycled yarn. The blended mixture is carded to clean and mix the fibres and spun ready for weaving or knitting. The fibres can also be compressed for mattress production. Textiles sent to the flocking industry are shredded to make filling material for car insulation, roofing felts, loudspeaker cones, panel linings and furniture padding. According to Earth911.com, \\"Metal hangers, while made of steel, can be difficult to recycle because their hooks can damage recycling equipment and some have a petroleum coating. Some curbside recycling programs do accept them.... Many dry cleaners take back hangers, too....\\" Chat and furnace slag In North America, mine chat waste can be used on snow-covered roads to improve traction; as gravel; and as construction aggregate, principally for railway ballast, highway construction, and concrete production. Furnace slag and to a lesser degree coal slag have been used in lieu of construction and railway ballast gravel in the UK. Clinker, slag, fly ash and in some cases ashes have all historically been used in places such as the industrial parts of Yorkshire and South Wales to make domestic cinder paths.

Early life Felt was born in Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Felt and his wife the former Hannah Reeves. The older Felt died when Nathaniel H. was seven. Felt studied in local schools and was a member of the Divisionary Corps of Independent Cadets until age 15 when he became an apprentice to a tailor in Lynn, Massachusetts. He also clerked from about age 14 in a Salem, Massachusetts retail store for Mr. Benjamin Cox. With the aid of an older brother, John Gillingham Felt, he at age 21 set up a tailor shop with multiple employees and was then involved in trade with China and parts of west Africa. Felt's ancestry in Salem was deep and well-connected having descended from George Felt who first arrived in Salem in the year 1628 with John Endecott. On 3 October 1839 Felt married his second cousin Eliza Ann Preston. Both Nathaniel and Eliza were descendants of Bridget Bishop. The well-connected Felt family had many relatives in town and nearby; one of the most luminary examples was Joseph Barlow Felt who was Nathaniel's much older first cousin and often-cited Massachusetts historian. Earliest Latter Day Saint involvement On 17 September 1843 the Felts were baptized as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, primarily as a result of the missionary work of Erastus Snow. A likely attendee at the baptism ceremony was Brigham Young, future President of the LDS Church. who became a lifelong associate of Nathaniel and Eliza. In March 1844, Felt was ordained president of the Salem Branch of the Church by Erastus Snow. In late spring 1844, Brigham Young sent his teenage daughter Vilate from Nauvoo, Illinois with Augusta Adams Cobb to live with the Felts in Salem in order for her to obtain a proper education. By June 1844, Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff were frequent visitors in the Felt home during their efforts to elect Joseph Smith Jr president of the United States. When Smith was murdered at Carthage, Illinois, Brigham Young returned to Nauvoo and became leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In late Spring 1845 the Felts moved to Nauvoo and donated carpets and furniture to be used as furnishings in the Nauvoo Temple. While in Nauvoo he was the tailor for Brigham Young, John Taylor and many other Mormon leaders in the city. Felt was involved in the Battle of Nauvoo serving under the overall command of Daniel H. Wells. Shortly after this Felt became ill and so went to St. Louis, Missouri to try to regain his health, this was in the fall of 1846. St. Louis branch presidency In February 1847 Felt was appointed president of the St. Louis Branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. By this time the branch numbered well over 800 members. Largely due to emigration from elsewhere but also as a result of baptisms there the branch was growing even more. In March 1847 the St. Louis Conference (roughly equivalent to a District in present LDS Church organization) was organized by Felt into six ecclesiastical wards with governing council of twelve bishops to oversee emigration and relief for the poor. With areas outside St. Louis added to the Conference's jurisdiction it soon had between 3,000 and 10,000 Latter-day Saints under its watch. Besides various branches in St. Louis, Felt also supervised branches in Alton, Illinois and Gravois. Felt also oversaw the purchasing of supplies for and the chartering of steamboats for the British Mormons who would stop in St. Louis on their way to Utah. Another major activity of Felt while in St. Louis was giving priesthood blessings, visiting and comforting the sick, and other such things during the cholera epidemic after the great fire of 1849. In the end, Felt proved himself valuable to Brigham Young who used him for many other assignments in the following years. Move to the Utah Territory After serving as St Louis conference president for slightly more than three years, Felt was released in 1850 and started west with his wife and three children. He crossed the plains in the Edward Hunter Company which included the Heywood and Woolley Church Merchandise Train managed by Joseph L. Heywood and Edwin D. Woolley and primarily consisted of wagons carrying goods bought by the Church to try to avoid paying exorbitant rates charged by some merchants in Utah. Nathaniel would have been familiar with such enterprises having descended from great grandfather Jonathan Felt whose sons David and John Felt ran a successful shipping business from Salem. Felt arrived in Utah in October 1850 and was appointed an alderman of Salt Lake City in January 1851 by Brigham Young. In August 1851 Felt was elected to the first Utah Territorial Legislature. During the early 1850s he also helped George A. Smith in founding the town of Parowan, Utah. In the same year Felt was called as a traveling bishop of the LDS Church, with the assignment to instruct local bishops in various locations on the proper methods of processing and recording tithing and other donations. In 1852 Felt was appointed chaplain of the Nauvoo Legion (the name then used by the Utah Territorial Militia) with the rank of colonel and standing on the general staff. In 1854 Felt entered the practice of plural marriage, marrying Sarah Strange as his second wife. In 1854-1856 Felt served as a missionary in New York City where he served as assistant editor of The Mormon under John Taylor. During Felt's journey back from New York he intercepted the tragic handcart companies of 1856 including the Willie and Martin group. Later life Later in 1856 Felt married his third and last wife, Mary Louisa Pile. He was the father of 17 children. In 1858 Felt received a contract to supply grain to Camp Floyd. He set up a grain distribution system with locations in Salt Lake City, Nephi, Utah and Ephraim, Utah. When President Abraham Lincoln died, Felt served on a committee to honor the president's life. Soon thereafter when the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Schuyler Colfax, visited Salt Lake City with Massachusetts gadfly reporter Samuel Bowles, Nathaniel H. Felt was one of their hosts. Of Felt it was written, \\"Perhaps the most refined man of our hosts in personal appearance and manners was a Mr. Felt, originally from Salem, Mass.; he lived in a very neat two-story cottage, embowered with trees, and with two or three suggestive front doors.\\" The suggestive front doors referred to polygamy as the reason for having more than one front door. From 1865 to 1867 Felt served a mission to Great Britain, for part of this time serving as president of the London District. From November 1869 to May 1870 Felt served a mission in New England. Felt maintained regular correspondence to local newspapers and the Salem Gazette in his hometown. His personality tended toward sharing news and opinion through letters; many of which have been saved by the Historians Office of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and others. He crusaded vigorously in favor of the practice of plural marriage after 1854 (including a formal \\"remonstration\\" to congress) and he watched political matters closely. He was elected several times as either alderman or member of the city council in Salt Lake. As he aged his health declined, but he maintained employment as a cashier for ZCMI. Felt was an active contributor to Salem's Essex Institute (now Peabody Essex Museum) where several of his donations can be accessed including an 1842 edition of the Book of Mormon and a large patent document from England. Nathaniel Henry Felt died on Thursday, 27 January 1887. Notes References * Orson F. Whitney.

His father was preacher at Esbeck. Having received his early education at the Adreanum in Hildesheim, he went in his eighteenth year to the University of Helmstedt, where he studied under Georg Calixtus and Conrad Horneius. In 1628 he took his degree of master of philosophy in Jena and was called as pastor to the church of St. Magnus in Brunswick. After seven years of beneficent activity there, he received a call to Hildesheim, the seat of George, duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, as court chaplain and preacher in the Collegiate of St. Blaise. After the duke's death (1641), he, as well as the whole consistory, removed to Hanover, where he became chief court chaplain and general superintendent of the principality of Calenberg. Later (1665) he was general superintendent of Grubenhagen as well. He received the degree of doctor of divinity in 1643 for a dissertation, De igne purgatorio. Gesenius' importance lies chiefly in the services he rendered in the production of good hymnals and catechisms. With his friend David Denicke, he brought out a hymnal containing 222 hymns (Hanover, 1646), which was later enlarged and arranged for use in the churches. The compilers did not confine themselves to collecting and arranging the hymns, but also adapted many of the older ones and probably added a few of their own composition. To correct the prevailing ignorance in regard to Christian doctrine, Gesenius, in 1631, brought out his Kleine Katechismusschule, or \\" Brief Instruction as to how the Catechism Should be Taught to the Young and the Simple \\" (often reprinted). Later, by order of Duke George and of the consistory, he issued an abridgment of this work under the title Kleine Catechismusfragen √ºber den kleinen Catechismum Lutheri (1639 and manytimes republished). This work constitutes the celebrated catechism of Gesenius, which was introduced into all the schools of the principality of Calenberg and gained great repute in many parts of Lower Saxony. Notwithstanding the praise which was accorded the author, he was violently attacked, especially by Statius Buscher in his Cryptopapismus novae theologiae Helmstadiensis (Hamburg, 1638). Although Gesenius justified himself in a Grundliche Widerlegung (Lunenburg, 1641) and although his innocence was established through an investigation by impartial theologians, it must be admitted that, carried away by his zeal for a lively faith and for better knowledge, he allowed himself to wander from the straight path of Lutheran doctrine. Of the charge that he was secretly a Roman Catholic he clears himself in his last important work, Warum willst du nicht r√∂misch-katholisch werden, wie deine Vorfahren waren? (4 parts, Hanover, 1669 72). The strife concerning his Catechismusfragen was renewed in the eighteenth century, when King George I, in 1723, sought vainly to introduce Gesenius' catechism into the duchies of Bremen and Verden (cf. Unschuldige Nachrichten, 1724). In addition to the other services rendered by Gesenius to the cause of religious education, he published, in 1656, a manual of instruction in Biblical history, Biblische Historien Alten and Neuen Testaments.

The basic features of the performance include a lengthy invocation, a dance by the main character, and a play or skit. The invocation is enacted by slow rhythmic movements of legs, arms and fingers. The dramatic repertoire of Menora performance is based on Thai legends of Manohara, derived from the Buddhist Jataka tales, many of which already accultured into Malay society centuries ago. In the northeastern state of Kelantan and Terengganu, Menora incorporates much use of Malay language and a mak yong-style dance movements. While in the northwestern state of Kedah, it is performed in a mixture of Thai and local dialects, but adheres to the invocation-play in a distinctly north Malaysian style and incorporates some elements of Jikey and Mek Mulung. The musical ensemble consists of a pair of hand cymbals, a pair of small knobbed gongs, a pair of wooden sticks, a barrel-shaped kendang, a reed instrument and a vase-shaped single headed drum.

The play was a critical point for the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, as an incomplete pass (or a failed first-down conversion) would have likely resulted in a loss to Purdue, which in turn, would have almost certainly removed Ohio State from national championship contention. The nickname \\"Holy Buckeye\\" is a play on other similar expressions (e.g., \\"holy cow\\", \\"holy mackerel\\", etc.) and came from Brent Musburger, the ABC television play-by- play announcer, who exclaimed the phrase as the completion was made. Events of the play Diagram of the King Right 64 Y Shallow Swap (the \\"Holy Buckeye\\") Ohio State, which had been struggling on offense for the entire game, found itself with a 3rd and 14 at the 50-yard line, trailing Purdue by a score of 6‚Äì3 with 2:26 remaining in the game. After completing a 13-yard pass to Ben Hartsock on the left sideline, Ohio State had a 4th and 1 to go. Rather than have the kicker Mike Nugent attempt a long field goal to tie, or call a running play for tailback Lydell Ross to gain the necessary yardage to avoid a turnover on downs (star running back Maurice Clarett was injured and could not play), Jim Tressel called the \\"King Right 64 Y Shallow Swap\\" - a pass. With the game clock still running from the previous play, the ball was snapped with just 1:44 left, and after dropping back, quarterback Craig Krenzel stepped up into the pocket and threw a 37-yard pass down the left sideline, which was caught by Michael Jenkins in the endzone to score the winning touchdown.

It would have made heavy use of the preceding Blue Streak missile and the Black Knight test rocket development programmes, as well as some new elements, to produce a British-built launcher capable of deploying medium-sized payloads into orbit. Popularly known as the Black Prince due to its assigned rainbow code, in official documentation, the platform was referred to as the Blue Streak Satellite Launch Vehicle (BSSLV). The Black Prince originated from various ballistic missile programmes that were being conducted by the United Kingdom during the 1950s. As envisioned, it was to have been a multistage rocket, the first stage being the Blue Streak and the second stage being the Black Knight. This would have been mated to a variety of different interchangeable third stages, differing based upon the individual intended mission profile. According to performance projections, the Black Prince would have been capable of delivering a 960 kg (2,117 lb) payload to a 740 km (400 nmi) orbit. The Black Prince gained several supporters, including official government backing following the termination of military involvement in the Blue Stream programme during early 1960. It was seen as a viable means of reusing existing development work, but one that would still involve significant costs. The British government promoted the concept to other potential partners across Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations, however it became clear that the necessary backing would not be forthcoming. Work on the Black Prince launcher came to an effective halt shortly after the formation of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) working group and a government decision to proceed with British participation in the multinational Europa launcher programme instead. During the late 1960s, it was proposed that elements of the Black Knight could be combined with the later Black Arrow launcher. Development =Background= A Black Knight rocket ‚Äì the intended second stage for the Black Prince launcher A preserved Blue Streak missile ‚Äì the intended first stage for the Black Prince launcher During the early 1950s, the British government had identified the need to develop its own series of ballistic missiles due to advances being made in this field, particularly by the Soviet Union and the United States.Hill 2001, p. 249. A British programme to develop such a missile, named Blue Streak, was promptly initiated; however, there were key questions over the then-relatively unknown scenario of what such a vehicle would encounter when attempting re-entry to the atmosphere, there were fears that such a vehicle might simply burn up like a meteor and therefore be unachievable.Laycock and Laycock 2005, pp. 51‚Äì52. At the same time, Britain had also never previously developed a ballistic missile before, the field being relatively new and with few participants, thus there was significant value in developing and constructing a research ballistic missile in order to gain experience and data on how to design and build such vehicles, develop launch techniques, and general handling.Hill 2001, p. 251. Accordingly, during 1955, the Black Knight research rocket programme was commenced for this purpose.Hill 2001, p. 22.Massie and Robins 1986, p. 226. Following several launches, the Black Knight came to be regarded as a successful programme, having produced a relatively low cost and reliable rocket, and thus there was impetus present to proceed with further development of the platform.Hill 2001, p. 188. The Black Prince itself has its origins in a proposed design was put forward by Desmond King-Hele and Doreen Gilmour of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) during 1957.Harvey 2003, p. 38. As envisioned by this proposal, an expendable launch system could be developed using a mix of preexisting and in-development assets; the multi-stage launcher was to be formed of a Blue Streak first stage, a Black Knight (or Black Arrow) second stage, and a military solid rocket as a third stage. The proposal, which subsequently became widely known as the Black Prince, quickly attracted the attention of a key supporter in Dr Geoffrey Pardoe, the project manager for the Blue Streak missile programme. =Space launcher= On 13 April 1960, the Defence Minister Harold Watkinson announced the cancellation of Blue Streak as a military programme, and went on to state that: \\"the Government will now consider with the firms and other interests concerned, as a matter of urgency, whether the Blue Streak programme could be adapted for the development of a launcher for space satellites.\\" While development of the Blue Streak missile continued with the view of using it as a capable satellite launcher, the rate of work was substantially slowed. Aerospace author C.N Hill wrote that this declaration had been made: \\"Mainly, I suspect, to minimise the political damage that ensued from the [Blue Streak] decision\\".Hill 2001, p. 13. The 1957 concept design for a combined Blue Streak-Black Knight launcher was put forward once again, and this time received a favourable appraisal; the project was assigned the rainbow code of Black Prince. In official documentation, the platform was referred to as the Blue Streak Satellite Launch Vehicle (BSSLV).Hill 2001, pp. 125‚Äì126. The development of Black Prince was driven by the conjunction of the RAE and two private firms, aerospace manufacturer Saunders Roe and engine firm Bristol Siddeley. It was quickly recognised that the programme's cost would be a major issue, one estimate of the total development costs would have been equal of half of the Britain's university budget.Hill 2001, pp. 13‚Äì14. At the same point, it was becoming clear that, due to British military satellites already being delivered by American launchers and the domestic science community being perceived as lacking the funding to conduct multiple major research satellite programmes at once, that domestic demand for such a launcher was not guaranteed. Accordingly, it was decided that it would be preferable for other nations to be involved in the programme in order to share the burden of the costs and to be predisposed to making use of the launcher.Hill 2001, p. 14. The Black Prince programme underwent several major changes during development. In March 1961, the RAE informed Saunders Roe that it had decided to adopt a French- built second stage for the launcher in place of the Black Knight. During the mid-1960s, the deployment of some form of combination of the Black Knight with the later Black Arrow launcher was also under consideration.Hill 2001, pp. 130‚Äì131. =Cancellation= By late 1960, it was clear that no British Government department was prepared to provide full financing for the programme, and that neither would any of Britain's allies across the Commonwealth of Nations be prepared to make major contributions in order to meet the shortfall. Most Commonwealth members either lacked the resources to spare in order to participate, or lacked interest in doing so. Canada was already overcommitted to its existing space-related scientific commitments, while Australia reportedly lacked interest in the programme beyond supporting operations at Woomera; accordingly, the prospects for a joint programme to develop and operate the Black Knight were very dim.Hill 2001, pp. 126‚Äì127. Britain had also made diplomatic approaches to various European nations, the most significant of these being to France. An overture to the French Government by the Aviation Minister Peter Thorneycroft led to the formation of the European European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) group. In response to this initiative, work on the Black Prince launcher by the RAE and Saunders Roe soon came to a halt as attention from the British government waned and European negotiations continued. Instead, British participation in the multinational Europa launcher programme had gradually taken precedence.Hill 2001, pp. 140‚Äì141. In several respects, the Europa launcher was relatively similar to the Black Prince; notably, both launchers used the Blue Streak as their first stage, albeit with some improvements being made by the time of the later Europa launches taking place.Hill 2001, p. 141. Europa combined the British-built Blue Streak with sections built by other nations, such as the French-built second stage and Italian-built payload fairing. However, being roughly the same size and payload capacity as the Black Prince, Europa suffered the same key problem of customer demand: it remained too expensive for scientific missions, but incapable of carrying the larger payloads sought by the commercial sector.Hill 2001, pp. 141, 143. Ultimately, none of the ELDO members showed particular enthusiasm for the Europa launcher, which, according to Hill, was often regarded as being unnecessary and having been based on 'old technology', leading to the programme being both a political and technical failure. While the performance of Europa proved disappointing and below expectations, following further restructuring, it was succeeded by the commercially viable and successful Ariane family of launchers. Design The Black Prince was an expendable launch system that comprised a combination of preexisting and in-development assets; the multi- stage launcher was to be formed of a Blue Streak first stage, a Black Knight (or Black Arrow) second stage, and a military solid rocket as a third stage. Several different third stages would be available, depending on the required payload and orbit. Examples of orbits suggested by Saunders Roe and the RAE were a 556 km (300 nmi) orbit for 'experiments in stellar UV spectroscopy', a 556‚Äì1,296 km (300-i) orbit for 'enabling investigations of the Earth's radiation belts,' and a 556‚Äì185,200 km (300-i) orbit for a 'Space probe.'Hill 2001, p. 125. According to Hill, the failure to tailor the Black Prince to perform a specific mission or to clearly identify and promote the launcher as a platform for a given mission type had been a major failing of the overall programme. There were some problems with the design, however. The relative power of the rocket reduced with altitude.Hill 2001, p. 127. The solution requested by the government and provided by Saunders Roe was to use a high- energy cryogenic upper stage which would increase the payload to 408 kg (900 lb) to a 9,260 km (5,i) orbit, and 272 kg (600 lb) to a 16,670 km (9,i) orbit. The cost of developing the upper stage was estimated to be ¬£5‚Äì7 million.Hill 2001, p. 130. Payloads were estimated to be around 1,034 kg (2,280 lb) to a 370 km (200 nmi) orbit and 960 kg (2,117 lb) to a 740 km (400 nmi) orbit. However, the design was considered to be inefficient and difficult because of the large differences in the diameters of the 3 metre (10 ft) wide Blue Streak and the metre-wide (3 ft) Black Knight. Fitting satellites into a three-foot payload fairing could also have been a challenge.Hill 2001, p. 118. Nevertheless, these difficulties were also encountered with successful American rockets including the Thor and Atlas.Hill 2001, p. 119.

Gadgil, was an Indian economist, institution builder and the vice-chairman of the Planning Commission of India. He was the founder Director of the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune and the author of the Gadgil formula, which served as the base for the allocation of central assistance to states during the Fourth and Fifth Five Year Plans of India. He is credited with contributions towards the development of Farmers' Cooperative movement in Maharashtra. The Government of India recognised his services by issuing a commemorative postage stamp in his honour in 2008.  Biography  = Early years = Gadgil was born on 10 April 1901 in Nasik in the western Indian state of Maharashtra as the son of Ramchandra Bhargav, in Brahmin family which had migrated from the Konkan region. His early education was at his ancestral city of Nagpur after which he graduated from Mumbai University and proceeded to Cambridge University from where he secured Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Literature (MLitt) degrees. It is reported that the dissertation he submitted for his MLitt degree became a classic and was published by Oxford University Press as a book, The Industrial Evolution of India in Recent Times in 1924. He stayed at Cambridge and returned to India after obtaining a DLitt (Honoris Causa). = Career = Once in his home country, Gadgil joined the Maharashtra government service but gave it up in 1925 to serve as the principal at the Maganlal Thakordas Balmukunddas Arts College, Surat. Later, he associated himself with the Servants of India Society of Gopal Krishna Gokhale and when the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) was established in Pune in 1930, he became its founder director. His tenure at the institute lasted till 1933 during which time he undertook several projects related to development of rural economy. He was also a member of the Indian Economic Association and served as its president for the year 1940. In 1946, the Government of Maharashtra entrusted him and A. D. Gorwala, an Indian Civil Service officer, with the responsibility of devising a plan for the distribution of food in times of scarcity, and they recommended the introduction of fair price shops and rationing system, reportedly against the suggestions of Mahatma Gandhi. He was also involved with the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement and the cooperative sector and is known to have drawn up a plan for the development of Mumbai and Pune. Meanwhile, Gadgil's involvement with the cooperative movement in Maharashtra grew as he got associated with Vithalrao Vikhe Patil, Shankarrao Dhumal (father of Ajay Dhumal), and Vaikunthbhai Mehta, three of the pioneers of Indian cooperative movement. He became a director of the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank in 1930, served as the chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank and held the chair of the National Federation of Cooperative Banks. His association with Vithalrao Vikhe Patil and Shankarrao Dhumal is said to have resulted in the founding of Pravara Cooperative Sugar Factory, the first industrial venture in the Asian cooperative sector, in 1949. The venture, which later came to be known as the Pravara Model of Integrated Rural Development, is reported to have gained national recognition. He also served as the president of the National Cooperative Union of India, the apex organisation of the cooperative movement in India. The Reserve Bank of India included him as a member of the Survey Panel for the rural credit and, later, in 1952, he became a director of the apex bank in India, holding the post for a decade, till 1962. In 1966, he took up the post of the vice-chancellor of the Savitribai Phule Pune University but stayed at the post only for one year to move to Union Government as the Deputy chairman of the now defunct Planning Commission of India, the highest bureaucratic position in the Indian economic sector which holds the rank of a cabinet minister. He also served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament, from 3 April 1966 to 31 August 1967. =Gadgil formula = After his appointment as a member of the Planning Commission of India, Gadgil conducted studies on the pattern of allocation of central assistance to the states in the Five-Year Plans of India. In 1969, he evolved a set of guidelines for the purpose, popularly known as the Gadgil formula, which formed the base of central assistance to states in the Fourth and the Fifth Five-Year Plans of India. The proposals were based on the parameters such as Population (60%), Per Capita Income (10%), Tax Effort (10%), On-going Irrigation and Power Projects (10%) and Special Problems (10%). Later, on insistence from the state governments, the formula was revised (modified Gardgil formula) as Population (55%), PCI (25% ‚Äì calculated by deviation and distance methods), Fiscal Management (5%) and Special Development Problems (15%). In 1990, the standards were again modified, when Pranab Mukherjee, the former President of India, held the post of the deputy chairmanship of the Planning Commission, and the new set of rules came to be known as Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. = Personal life and honours = Gadgil is known to have been an enthusiastic reader and had a personal library composed of 3000 books. He was married to Pramila and the couple had three sons, Ajit, Purshottam and Madhav, and one daughter, Sulabha. He died on 3 May 1971, succumbing to a heart failure, while he was travelling from New Delhi to Pune. His youngest son, Madhav Gadgil, is a renowned ecologist, who chaired the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) of 2010, popularly known as the Gadgil Commission. = Honours = A year after Gadgil's death, the Government of Maharashtra and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly started a training institute, Dhananjayrao Gadgil Institute of Co- operative Management (DGICM) at Nagpur, in 1972, to provide training for state government and cooperative sector employees, which is run by the National Council for Cooperative Training (NCCT), New Delhi. On his birth centenary year, Maharashtra Economic Development Council, instituted the Gadgil Centenary Memorial Lecture, which is an annual event. The Government of India honoured him with a commemorative postage stamp, designed by reputed stamp designer, Sankha Samanta, in 2008. Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India, unveiled a statue of Gadgil at Pravara Nagar in Maharashtra on 8 February 2008. The central library of the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics has been named Dhananjayrao Gadgil Library, in his honour.  Publications  Gadgil's first published book was his MLitt thesis, The Industrial Evolution of India in Recent Times, originally published by Oxford University Press, in 1924 and subsequently reprinted many times. His researches in the 1930s and 40s, were brought out as a book, The Federal problem in India by Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in the Indian Independence year of 1947. The institute published another of his work, Economic Effects of Irrigation: report of a survey of the direct and indirect benefits of the Godavari and Pravara canals, in 1948. His observations on the economic policy of India have been documented as a book, Planning and economic policy in India, first published in 1961, prior to his joining the Planning Commission of India, reprinted subsequently by Sangam Books in 1979. In 2011, Oxford University Press, compiled his works and published India Economy: Problems and Prospects, The: Selected Writings of D.R Gadgil, edited by the noted economist-activist, Sulabha Brahme.

The Gallic War mainly took place in what is now France. In 55 and 54 BC, he invaded Britain, although he made little headway. The Gallic War ended with complete Roman victory at the Battle of Alesia. This was followed by the civil war, during which time Caesar chased his rivals to Greece, decisively defeating them there. He then went to Egypt, where he defeated the Egyptian pharaoh and put Cleopatra on the throne. He then finished off his Roman opponents in Africa and Hispania. Once his campaigns were over, he served as Roman dictator until his assassination on March 15, 44 BC. These wars were critically important in the transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. First consulship and triumvirate Bust of Julius Caesar, posthumous portrait in marble, 44-30 BC, Museo Pio- Clementino, Vatican Museums Three candidates stood for the consulship in 59 BC: Caesar, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus who had been aedile with Caesar several years earlier, and Lucius Lucceius. The election was dirty. Caesar canvassed Cicero for support, and made an alliance with the wealthy Lucceius, but the establishment threw its financial weight behind the conservative Bibulus, and even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in his favour. Caesar and Bibulus were elected as consuls.Plutarch, Caesar 13‚Äì14; Suetonius 19 Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey, who was unsuccessfully fighting the Senate for ratification of his eastern settlements and farmland for his veterans. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds since they were consuls together in 70 BC, and Caesar knew if he allied himself with one he would lose the support of the other, so he endeavoured to reconcile them. Between the three of them, they had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (rule of three men), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia.Cicero, Letters to Atticus 2.1, 2.3, 2.17; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.44; Plutarch, Caesar 13‚Äì14, Pompey 47, Crassus 14; Suetonius, Julius 19.2; Cassius Dio, Roman History 37.54‚Äì58 Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who was elected to the consulship for the following year.Suetonius, Julius 21 Caesar proposed a law for the redistribution of public lands to the poor, a proposal supported by Pompey, by force of arms if need be, and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, and the triumvirate's opponents were intimidated. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His lictors had their fasces broken, two tribunes accompanying him were wounded, and Bibulus himself had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts to obstruct Caesar's legislation proved ineffective. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar\\".Cicero, Letters to Atticus 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20, 2.21; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 44.4; Plutarch, Caesar 14, Pompey 47‚Äì48, Cato the Younger 32‚Äì33; Cassius Dio, Roman History 38.1‚Äì8 This also gave rise to this lampoon- The event occurred, as I recall, when Caesar governed Rome- Caesar, not Bibulus, who kept his seat at home. When Caesar and Bibulus were first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit Caesar's future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than governorship of a province, as their proconsular duties after their year of office was over.Suetonius, Julius 19.2 With the help of Piso and Pompey, Caesar later had this overturned, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (the western Balkans), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his pro-consulship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2:44.4; Plutarch, Caesar 14.10, Crassus 14.3, Pompey 48, Cato the Younger 33.3; Suetonius, Julius 22; Cassius Dio, Roman History 38:8.5 When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.Suetonius, Julius 23 =Conquest of Gaul= The Roman Republic in 40 BC after Caesar's conquests Caesar was still deeply in debt, and there was money to be made as a provincial governor, whether by extortionSee Cicero's speeches against Verres for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense. or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces, Illyricum and Gallia Narbonensis, bordered on unconquered territory, and independent Gaul was known to be unstable. Rome's allies the Aedui had been defeated by their Gallic rivals, with the help of a contingent of Germanic Suebi under Ariovistus, who had settled in conquered Aeduan land, and the Helvetii were mobilising for a mass migration, which the Romans feared had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated first the Helvetii, then Ariovistus, and left his army in winter quarters in the territory of the Sequani, signalling that his interest in the lands outside Gallia Narbonensis would not be temporary.Cicero, Letters to Atticus 1.19; Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 1; Appian, Gallic Wars Epit. 3; Cassius Dio, Roman History 38.31‚Äì50 Roman silver denarius with the head of captive Gaul 48 BC, following the campaigns of Caesar He began his second year with double the military strength of the previous year, having raised another two legions in Cisalpine Gaul during the winter. The legality of this was dubious, as the Cisalpine Gauls were not Roman citizens. In response to Caesar's activities the previous year, the Belgic tribes of north- eastern Gaul had begun to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move, and, after an inconclusive engagement against a united Belgic army, conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one legion, commanded by Crassus' son Publius, began the conquest of the tribes of the Armorican peninsula.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 2; Appian, Gallic Wars Epit. 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History 39.1‚Äì5 During the spring of 56 BC the Triumvirate held a conference at Luca (modern Lucca) in Cisalpine Gaul. Rome was in turmoil, and Clodius' populist campaigns had been undermining relations between Crassus and Pompey. The meeting renewed the Triumvirate and extended Caesar's proconsulship for another five years. Crassus and Pompey would be consuls again, with similarly long-term proconsulships to follow: Syria for Crassus, the Hispanian provinces for Pompey.Cicero, Letters to his brother Quintus 2.3; Suetonius, Julius 24; Plutarch, Caesar 21, Crassus 14‚Äì15, Pompey 51 The conquest of Armorica was completed when Caesar defeated the Veneti in a naval battle, while young Crassus conquered the Aquitani of the south-west. By the end of campaigning in 56 BC only the Morini and Menapii of the coastal Low Countries still held out.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 3; Cassius Dio, Roman History 39.40‚Äì46 In 55 BC Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by the Germanic Usipetes and Tencteri, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued the Morini and Menapii, he crossed to Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided the Veneti against him the previous year. His intelligence was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the Kent coast he was unable to advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 4; Appian, Gallic Wars Epit. 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History 47‚Äì53 He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, establishing Mandubracius of the Trinovantes as a friendly king and bringing his rival, Cassivellaunus, to terms. But poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, led by Ambiorix of the Eburones, forcing Caesar to campaign through the winter and into the following year. With the defeat of Ambiorix, Caesar believed Gaul was now pacified.Cicero, Letters to friends 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.10, 7.17; Letters to his brother Quintus 2.13, 2.15, 3.1; Letters to Atticus 4.15, 4.17, 4.18; Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 5‚Äì6; Cassius Dio, Roman History 40.1‚Äì11 While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to regain Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece Octavia in marriage, alienating Octavia's husband Gaius Marcellus, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of Parthia. Rome was on the edge of violence. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married Cornelia, daughter of Caesar's political opponent Quintus Metellus Scipio, whom he invited to become his consular colleague once order was restored. The Triumvirate was dead.Suetonius, Julius ; Plutarch, Caesar 23.5, Pompey 53‚Äì55, Crassus 16‚Äì33; Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 46‚Äì47 left In 52 BC another, larger revolt erupted in Gaul, led by Vercingetorix of the Arverni. Vercingetorix managed to unite the Gallic tribes and proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements including the Battle of Gergovia, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 7; Cassius Dio, Roman History 40.33‚Äì42 Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year,Aulus Hirtius, Commentaries on the Gallic War Book 8 Gaul was effectively conquered. Titus Labienus was Caesar's most senior legate during his Gallic campaigns, having the status of propraetor.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 1.21 Other prominent men who served under him included his relative Lucius Julius Caesar,Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 7.65 Crassus' sons PubliusJulius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 2.34 and Marcus,Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 6.6 Cicero's brother Quintus,Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 6.32f. Decimus Brutus,Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 3.11 and Mark Antony.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 7.81f. Plutarch claimed that the army had fought against three million men in the course of the Gallic Wars, of whom 1 million died, and another million were enslaved. 300 tribes were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed. Almost the entire population of the city of Avaricum (Bourges) (40,000 in all) was slaughtered. Julius Caesar reports that 368,000 of the Helvetii left home, of whom 92,000 could bear arms, and only 110,000 returned after the campaign. However, in view of the difficulty of finding accurate counts in the first place, Caesar's propagandistic purposes, and the common gross exaggeration of numbers in ancient texts, the totals of enemy combatants in particular are likely to be far too high. Furger-Gunti considers an army of more than 60,000 fighting Helvetii extremely unlikely in the view of the tactics described, and assumes the actual numbers to have been around 40,000 warriors out of a total of 160,000 emigrants.Furger-Gunti, 102. Delbr√ºck suggests an even lower number of 100,000 people, out of which only 16,000 were fighters, which would make the Celtic force about half the size of the Roman body of ca. 30,000.. men.H. Delbr√ºck Geschichte der Kriegskunst im Rahmen der politischen Geschichte, Vol. 1, 1900, pp. 428 and 459f. Civil war Bust of Pompey the Great in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as Proconsul had finished.Suetonius, Julius 28 Moreover, the Senate forbade Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted and politically marginalised if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a Consul or without the power of his army. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. On 10 January 49 BC Caesar crossed the Rubicon river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only one legion and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon, Plutarch reports that Caesar quoted the Athenian playwright Menander in Greek, saying anerrhiphth≈ç kubos (·ºÄŒΩŒµœÅœÅŒØœÜŒ∏œâ Œ∫œçŒ≤ŒøœÇ; let the dice be tossed).Plutarch, Caesar 60.2 Suetonius gives the Latin approximation alea iacta est (the die has been tossed).Suetonius, Julius 32 The Optimates, including Metellus Scipio and Cato the Younger, fled to the south, having little confidence in the newly raised troops especially since so many cities in northern Italy had voluntarily surrendered. An attempted stand by a consulate legion in Samarium resulted in the consul being handed over by the defenders and the legion surrendering without significant fighting. Despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey had no intention of fighting. Caesar pursued Pompey to Brindisium, hoping to capture Pompey before the trapped Senate and their legions could escape.Plutarch, Caesar 35.2 Pompey managed to elude him, sailing out of the harbour before Caesar could break the barricades. Having near no naval force since Pompey had already scoured the coasts of all ships for evacuation of his forces, Caesar decided to head for Hispania saying \\"I set forth to fight an army without a leader, so as later to fight a leader without an army.\\" Leaving Marcus Aemilius Lepidus as prefect of Rome, and the rest of Italy under Mark Antony as tribune, Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to Hispania, rejoining two of his Gallic legions, where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Greece where on 10 July 48 BC at Dyrrhachium Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat when the line of fortification was broken. He decisively defeated Pompey, despite Pompey's numerical advantage (nearly twice the number of infantry and considerably more cavalry), at Pharsalus in an exceedingly short engagement in 48 BC.Plutarch, Caesar 42‚Äì45 Bust of Cleopatra VII, Altes Museum, Berlin In Rome, Caesar was appointed dictator,Plutarch, Caesar 37.2 with Mark Antony as his Master of the Horse; Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulate (with Publius Servilius Vatia as his colleague) and then, after eleven days, resigned this dictatorate.Martin Jehne, Der Staat des Dicators Caesar, K√∂ln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38. He pursued Pompey to Alexandria, where Pompey was murdered by a former Roman officer serving in the court of King Ptolemy XIII.Plutarch, Pompey 77‚Äì79 Caesar then became involved with the Alexandrine civil war between Ptolemy and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, the Pharaoh Cleopatra VII. Perhaps as a result of Ptolemy's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra; he is reported to have wept at the sight of Pompey's head,Plutarch, Pompey 80.5 which was offered to him by Ptolemy's chamberlain Pothinus as a gift. In any event, Caesar withstood the Siege of Alexandria and latter he defeated the Ptolemaic forces in 47 BC in the Battle of the Nile and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory of the Alexandrine civil war with a triumphant procession on the Nile in the spring of 47 B.C. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, introducing Caesar to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs. Caesar and Cleopatra never married, as Roman Law only recognised marriages between two Roman citizens. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage, which lasted 14 years ‚Äì in Roman eyes, this did not constitute adultery ‚Äì and may have fathered a son called Caesarion. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the Tiber. Late in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed Dictator, with a term of one year. After spending the first months of 47 BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated King Pharnaces II of Pontus in the Battle of Zela; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies.Suetonius, Julius 35.2 Thence, he proceeded to Africa to deal with the remnants of Pompey's senatorial supporters. He quickly gained a significant victory at Thapsus in 46 BC over the forces of Metellus Scipio (who died in the battle) and Cato the Younger (who committed suicide).Plutarch, Caesar 52‚Äì54 After this victory, he was appointed Dictator for ten years.Martin Jehne, Der Staat des Dicators Caesar, K√∂ln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38. Technically, Caesar was not appointed Dictator with a term of ten years but he was appointed annual dictator for the next ten years in advance. Nevertheless, Pompey's sons Gnaeus Pompeius and Sextus Pompeius, together with Titus Labienus, Caesar's former propraetorian legate (legatus propraetore) and second in command in the Gallic War, escaped to Hispania. Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the Battle of Munda in March 45 BC.Plutarch, Caesar 56 During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46 BC (with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus) and 45 BC (without colleague). =Aftermath of the civil war= Roman minted coin. While he was still campaigning in Hispania, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar in absentia. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held on 21 April to honour Caesar‚Äôs victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.Plutarch, Caesar 56.7‚Äì56.8 On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian) as the heir to everything, including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Marcus Junius Brutus would be the next heir in succession. Caesar tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register. From 47 to 44 he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans. In 63 BC Caesar had been elected Pontifex Maximus, and one of his roles as such was settling the calendar. A complete overhaul of the old Roman calendar proved to be one of his most long lasting and influential reforms. In 46 BC, Caesar established a 365-day year with a leap day every fourth year.Suetonius, Julius 40 (This Julian calendar was subsequently modified by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 into the modern Gregorian calendar.) As a result of this reform, a certain Roman year (mostly equivalent to 46 BC in the modern calendar) was made 445 days long, to bring the calendar into line with the seasons. The month of July is named after Julius in his honour.Suetonius, Julius 76 The Forum of Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix, was built among many other public works.

His work has been exhibited at numerous international film festivals, fine art galleries, museums and independent cinemas. Early life Roberts grew up on a ranch in Fort Collins, Colorado. Broadley, Erin, \\"A Plague Called Complacency: Guerilla Filmmaker Burke Roberts Talks Film and Fanaticism,\\" SuicideGirls.com, April 1, 2007. At eighteen, Roberts came to Hollywood and acted extensively in television and film. His performances of note include Vincent Gallo's \\"Brown Bunny\\" and \\"NYPD Blue\\". He studied the Meisner Teqnique primarily with William Alderson, under the eye of Sanford Meisner during his declining years. In the late 1990s he stopped acting to shift his focus entirely to fimmaking and art installation. Director Moving behind the camera in the mid 1990s, Roberts' work as a director has received international acclaim in some part due to his unique DIY high-production values. He has been profiled in an eclectic array of cultural publications including a feature interview on Suicidegirls.com, Film Threat Magazine, Tank Magazine London, cover story for Cinetrange Paris, multiple articles in his hometown periodicals ‚Äì Los Angeles Times and L.A. Weekly and many more. In order to realize his work, Roberts formed \\"The Bizzurke Army Underground Film Militia,\\" (also known as \\"Bizarrmy\\") a network of artists and technicians who devote their time and talents pro bono to his productions. Baxter, Peter, \\"Slamdance Interview: Burke Roberts,\\" Slamdance.com, Friday August 8, 2008. His films deal with challenging themes, such as oppression, fanaticism and extreme circumstances. His first film \\"Jesus Rides Shotgun\\" gained a cult following and began an expanding body of challenging short works: \\"Handicap City\\", \\"Echo Of A Man\\", \\"Insult To Injury\\", \\"Some of An Equation\\", \\"Substance Ovuse\\", and \\"Sky Drops\\" - All of which have played in dozens of cities and countries due to Roberts unique approach of touring his films in a tradition historically practiced by independent musicians. Films A 'large scale guerrilla film' that takes place in the height of the great depression with train hoppers. This film screened in Paris, London, Barcelona, Berlin and many more.

Music videos Having avoided the music video arena for 15 years Roberts recently entered the genre - the first of which he directed was named in the top 50 music videos of 2010 by NME Magazine for Warpaint 'Stars'. Within his first year he directed videos for Swahili Blonde, Patrick Park, The Mccarricks, Sistol, Spindrift and Hollie Cook which premiered on such online venues as Pitchfork, NME, Paste Magazine and the Los Angeles Times. Art In recent years he has expanded his ventures into large scale sculptures and installation art. His portable projection system, \\"The Engine\\" is a pioneering angle of Roberts' DIY practices. The work consists of a 2000-pound light and steel sculpture that kinetically supports a 17-foot screen. Hart, Hugh, \\"The Engine at LACMA's Muse 'til Midnight,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 23, 2009. The transportable, self-contained exhibition system has been used as an alternative mode for distribution and presentation of alternative cinema. It debuted at The Architecture and Design Museum of Los Angeles and was shown at NASA, Tesla Motors Showroom, Burning Man and Coachella. Roberts also curated and produced a unique art festival in Los Angeles called Engine CollisionFest. The festival includes novelists, poets, performance artists, fashionistas, musicians, creators of new media and practitioners of cinema. Participants included Cory McAbee (\\"The American Astronaut\\"), creators of Adult Swim's Metalocalypse, Wu-Tang Clan's Raekwon and Warhol Superstar Cherry Vanilla.

History =Early Baroque= The stylistic roots of the concert lie in early baroque Italian models brought back to German by musicians such as Heinrich Sch√ºtz, and popularised by his contemporaries such as Samuel Scheidt. Some of these concerts take an Italianate dialogue or oratorio form, notably the works of Kaspar F√∂rster and the dialogues of Sch√ºtz. =Middle Baroque= The next generation of composers working in this form include Johann Schelle, Johann Philipp F√∂rtsch, Sebastian Kn√ºpfer, Dietrich Buxtehude and early members of the Bach family, the works of whom have been partially preserved in the Altbachisches Archiv. Johann Pachelbel is another composer contributing to the genre, for instance his Christ lag in Todesbanden, P 60, for SATB voices, strings, bassoon and continuo. Musical form and examples Reception German church music of the Baroque era composed after the first half of 17th century was throughout the 20th century hardly ever indicated as sacred concerto or, in German, . Pieces of this genre were mostly qualified as motets or as cantatas, for instance: * When Max Schneider published a large selection of the (ABA) in 1935, he ranged the compositions in two volumes, the first of which was called (Motets and choral songs), containing, among others, Johann Michael Bach's , and . Georg Christoph Bach's , ABA II, 2, was included in the second volume, titled (Cantatas). In 21st-century scholarship, the sacred concerto or description is used more often to indicate compositions from the late 17th or early 18th century: * A 2009 catalogue of the archive of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin describes Johann Michael Bach's ABA I, 6 and I, 7 as , and Georg Christoph Bach's ABA II, 2 as Sacred concerto.

It originally aired on NBC on September 30, 2010. The episode was written by B. J. Novak and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. \\"Counseling\\" guest stars Eric Zuckerman as a store clerk, Vincent Angelo as a vendor, and Michael Schur as Mose Schrute. Evan Peters also appears as Luke Cooper in archival footage from the previous episode. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is forced to have six hours of counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Peters), but Michael refuses to make Toby's job easy. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) attempts to finagle a promotion to office administrator and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) boycotts the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him. \\"Counseling\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The episode was viewed by 7.36 million viewers and received a 3.7 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, marking a significant drop in the ratings when compared to the previous week. Despite this, the episode was the highest-rated NBC series of the night that it aired, as well as the highest-rated non-sports NBC broadcast for the week it aired. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is assigned six hours of counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in \\"Nepotism\\", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael that he will not fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories, such as being raised by wolves and getting probed by Alf. Toby pretends to admit defeat, then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. Unaware he is even undergoing counseling, the method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people. At one point, he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that, and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked. Michael eventually realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and insults and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe, even making Toby laugh with his impression. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and \\"bang this out\\". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) realizes that although she has her dream job of salesman, she just might not be cut out for it after all since she makes few sales and very little money. A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea to finagle a promotion to office administrator, hopefully for some added income. She informs Gabe of her promotion \\"from a few months back\\" and tells him she has not been paid accordingly, to which Gabe promises her he will get the missing wages if she can get all of the department heads to sign off on it. While she is busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator, Gabe catches on that she might be lying, and confronts her about it. Using a strategy she learned from watching poker, she stands her ground against Gabe and becomes de facto office administrator. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) has decided to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him, going so far as to cancel orders to businesses there, including that of the other salesmen. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had come all the way there to say, \\"You made a big mistake. Huge!\\" The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came for: a pewter wizard statuette holding a crystal ball. Production alt= \\"Counseling\\" was written by B. J. Novak, a producer and screenwriter for the series who also portrays the character of Ryan Howard on the show. The entry was directed by Jeffrey Blitz, who had also directed the previous episode \\"Nepotism\\". \\"Counseling\\" features Eric Zuckerman, Vincent Angelo and Michael Schur in guest appearances as a store teller, a vendor, and Mose Schrute, respectively. Evan Peters also appears as Luke Cooper in archival footage from the previous episode. With the seventh season of The Office being Carell's last, the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves; the first half would \\"celebrate Carell's finale year and highlight different actors on the show\\", whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager. As such, \\"Counseling\\" was one of the first episodes of the season to specifically highlight other characters, in this case Lieberstein's character, Toby. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Stanley discussing boycotting Kellogg's, Dwight putting on his fancy clothing, Dwight getting his pipe from Creed, Kevin giving Dwight a tissue, extended footage of Michael's counseling session, Michael discussing dogs, and extended footage of Dwight in the mall. Cultural references At Dwight's daycare, a poster for the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse is hung on the wall; however, Dwight has scribbled out the words \\"Insane\\" and \\"Posse\\" to make it fit into the daycare. In the episode, Dwight's subplot is inspired by Julia Roberts's character in the film Pretty Woman. Dwight even attempts to use Roberts's line, \\"Big mistake\\", but instead renders it as \\"You made a big mistake. Huge!\\" During Michael's counseling session, he sardonically tells Toby that he was probed by ALF, the alien star of the eponymous television series. Michael and Toby later pass the time playing Connect Four. Darryl notes to Pam that he saw a TLC show about Kate Walsh's home office, and he wants one similar. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Counseling\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.36 million viewers with a 3.7 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a decrease in a million viewers and a 14 percent decrease in the 18‚Äì49 demographic from the previous episode. The episode became the highest-rated non-sports related NBC program for the original week it aired and also became the twenty-first most-watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Joel Keller of AOLTV called it a \\"vast improvement\\" from the previous episode \\"Nepotism\\", because he felt that \\"everyone at Dunder-Mifflin Scranton acted like themselves\\". Keller called Toby and Michael's counseling session \\"great\\" and enjoyed the way Toby was able to trick Michael. Kelly Gerlach of TV Equals enjoyed the episode and noted that it \\"felt like the earlier seasons\\" because \\"there wasn‚Äôt forced humor, nothing made me cringe in my seat because of bad writing, and the awkward situations were written specifically to be awkward.\\" In the end, she called the episode \\"decent\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the main story employed \\"one of the show's most reliable running jokes\\". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode, and he wondered if \\"this was a one-time thing, or if Michael's treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little.\\" Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it \\"pleasant\\". He wrote that each of the three stories \\"weren't flat out funny\\" but were \\"enjoyable\\". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C\\" grade. While he enjoyed the main storyline revolving around Michael and Toby and felt that it \\"came together both comically and dramatically at the end of the day\\", he felt the rest of the episode was \\"quite uneven\\" with elements that were \\"ridiculous\\", such as how Pam attained her new job. McNutt's largest complaint with the remainder of the episode was that neither ended in \\"a logical place\\"; he felt Dwight's plot featured a disconnect from the character, and that Pam's story was \\"lazy\\".

Written by Charlie Grandy and directed by John Stuart Scott, the episode aired on NBC in the United States on October 7, 2010. Guest stars include Robert Mammana, Phil Abrams and Robert R. Shafer. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) lands a role in a local production of Sweeney Todd and invites the entire office to the performance, hoping to impress his former girlfriend, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). While Michael Scott (Steve Carell) struggles to put his jealousy aside, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) have trouble with their less-than- stellar babysitter, Erin. Originally, the producers and writers wanted the in- show musical to be performed badly, but they later changed their minds and decided that the musical should be quality work, according to Helms. The episode featured several guest actors and actresses to round out the parts in the musical. \\"Andy's Play\\" was viewed by 6.95 million viewers and received a 3.5 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, marking a slight drop in the ratings when compared to the previous week. Despite this, the episode was the highest-ranked NBC series of the night and received positive reviews from critics. Synopsis Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is going to perform as Anthony Hope in a local production of Sweeney Todd, and he wants his co-workers to come. He makes a special effort to invite Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), whom he hopes to win back with a good performance, by buying tickets for her and Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is especially hard to convince, since he is still upset that he was not chosen to be in the musical after his own audition. Andy informs him that no one auditioning got the part of Sweeney Todd, which was instead given to a veteran \\"world class\\" actor, and Michael agrees to go. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) say they want to go, but have been unable to find a babysitter for their daughter Cece. Erin agrees to come, but she later decides to babysit Cece so Pam and Jim can attend instead. On the night of the show, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) reads from the program that contrary to Andy's assumption, the actor (Robert Mammana) playing Sweeney Todd has no acting or singing experience, and was discovered by the director while singing karaoke, annoying Michael. During the intermission, the director compliments Michael on the \\"energy\\" of his audition and encourages him to audition again, suggesting that he felt that Sweeney Todd simply wasn't the right production for Michael's acting style. Put out by this, Michael steals a bottle of wine from the concessions table, which he and his co-workers drink during the show. Andy, upset that Erin is not in the audience, repeatedly checks for messages from her on his cell phone. While he is on stage, his phone rings in his pocket, disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise. To make matters worse, Michael drops his bottle of wine, causing a commotion as it rolls. He then loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat, which pop as they hit the top of the hall. This startles a baby, and the sound of her cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with Cece, exciting Andy, but angering Jim and Pam. At the end of the show, everyone cheers except for Michael, who angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd. Later, in a kind of retaliation, Darryl starts to boo Michael in the middle of a conversation whenever he speaks. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), having found a loophole in her parenting contract with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) which permits him to develop romantic feelings for her, attempts to attract him. She uses another technicality in the contract to force him to take her to Andy's play as a date, and wears uncharacteristically revealing clothing. But when Dwight becomes lustful, Angela rebuffs him and insists that they count the date as one of their five required instances of sexual intercourse before leaving. Meanwhile, Andy and Erin chat backstage, and Erin states how happy she is that they are spending time together outside of the Office again. However they are interrupted by Gabe calling Erin, and she leaves to meet him. As Andy sulks backstage, his co-workers arrive and cheer him up by encouraging him to sing a rendition of Macy Gray's \\"I Try\\" while Darryl accompanies him on piano. Production \\"Andy's Play\\" was written by supervising producer Charlie Grandy, his fifth writing credit for the show. The episode was directed by John Stuart Scott, his first and only directing credit for the show. With the seventh season of The Office being Carell's last, the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves; the first half would \\"celebrate Carell's final year and highlight different actors on the show\\", whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager. As such, \\"Andy's Play\\" was one of the first episode of the season to specifically highlight \\"potential heirs to the throne\\", in this case Ed Helms' character, Andy. According to Helms, the original script called for the musical numbers to be \\"slaughtered\\" by the actors and actresses. However, as the episode was being finalized, the producers decided for the cast to \\"perform razor-sharp renditions\\" of the songs instead. Due to the ensemble nature of the musical featured in the episode, guest actors and actresses were required. Actor Robert Mammana portrayed Mitchel Walsh, who played the title role in the play within the play. Heather Marie Marsden played Mrs. Lovett, Maxwell Glick appeared as Tobias, and Phil Abrams appeared as Shelby Thomas Weems, the musical's director. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy discussing the \\"crowd dynamic\\" at musicals and music events, Gabe discussing his history of playing Ichabod Crane in three separate play productions, Pam and Jim discussing how hard it is to get a babysitter, Michael ordering flowers, Andy getting a pep talk from his director, Phyllis worrying about Cynthia and Bob bonding, and Kevin talking to his sister who happens to be playing a part in the musical. Cultural references The songs featured in the episode from the actual Sweeney Todd musical are \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\", \\"Johanna\\", and \\"By the Sea\\". Erin accidentally references The Baby-Sitters Club, a series of novels by Ann M. Martin, when talking about breaking into the babysitting business in Scranton. Michael brings balloons to the musical, Phyllis notes that they remind her of the 2009 Pixar film Up. Note: The dialogue can be accessed by enabling subtitles and/or closed captions. Jim mentions that trying to put CeCe to sleep reminds him of the 2008 war film The Hurt Locker. The ending scene features Michael auditioning for the musical by re-acting an entire episode of the American police procedural and legal drama television series Law & Order, complete with opening monologue, theme music, and the show's notable \\"Clang\\" sound effect. Andy sings Macy Gray's single \\"I Try\\" with the rest of the office to cheer himself up at the end of the episode. Reception Many critics commented upon the scene wherein Ed Helms's (pictured) character Andy checks his cellphone on stage. \\"Andy's Play\\" first aired on October 7, 2010. In its original American broadcast, it was viewed by an estimated 6.95 million viewers with a 3.5 rating/10 percent share among adults between the age of 18 and 49. This means that 3.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-old households watched the episode, and ten percent of that demographic had their televisions tuned to the channel at any point. This marked a 0.2 rating decrease from the previous weeks episode, although the episode ranked second in its time slot and was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. This episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that, Andy's Play' was the kind of strong, character driven episode I've missed from the show‚Äînot just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode, period.\\" Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode was a reminder of \\"what has always been great about this show\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode \\"worked largely because it embraced [the] idea\\" that \\"the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet, and that if you work with people long enough they can feel like your family.\\" He ultimately concluded that the episode was one that \\"makes me happy [that] I spent an evening in the company of these goofballs.\\" Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\", stating that it was \\"inconclusive\\" proof whether or not Andy could be the show's lead, in advance of Steve Carell's exit from the series, but that \\"in terms of providing entertainment, I think the episode worked quite well\\" and was \\"honest and charming\\". Vulture writer Phoebe Reilly was slightly critical of Apple product placements‚ÄîRyan's iPad and Andy's iPhone‚Äîbut found the use of the second \\"still funny: the signature chirp of Andy‚Äôs iPhone interrupts a scene, prompting him to pretend it‚Äôs a bird that he has to silence by saying, 'He's gone to sleep now. I've closed his beak. Many reviews commented upon Andy's phone-interrupted onstage scene. Poniewozik praised \\"Andy‚Äôs flop-sweat attempt to improvise his way out of his cellphone's going off while running up against the limits of what his character knows about Sweeney\\", calling it \\"hilarious\\". Forcella was complimentary towards \\"the awkward moment when his phone didn't stop ringing and [Andy] had to explain it on stage\\", noting that it had \\"brilliant timing and execution.\\" References External links * \\"Andy's Play\\" at NBC.com  2010 American television episodes The Office (American season 7) episodes Musical television episodes Sweeney Todd ","title":"Andy's Play"},{"id":"28934072","text":"Antioch is a ghost town in Sheridan County, Nebraska, United States. Located approximately 15 miles east of Alliance on Nebraska Highway 2, the town was once nicknamed \\"the potash capital of Nebraska.\\" The town took its name from Antioch, Ohio.  History  Antioch is located in the sparsely-populated Sandhills region of western Nebraska. According to one historian, the year before the United States became involved in World War I, the town only had one schoolhouse, a church, and a store. In 1917, scientists at the University of Nebraska introduced a method of distilling potash from the water of alkali lakes which dotted the Sandhills.(1919) The American Missionary. Volume 73. Congregational Home Missionary Society, American Missionary Association.\\"Antioch: Potash boom town\\". Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved Sept. 25, 2010. Potash had been primarily imported from Germany prior to World War I. German potash had sold for around $8 to $10 per ton, but scarcity during the war drove the price of potash to $150 a ton. Antioch's proximity to several major alkali lakes made it the logical home of five potash reduction factories: the American, Nebraska, Alliance, National, and Western potash companies.\\"The Great WWI Potash Industry of Southern Sheridan County, Nebraska\\" Sheridan County Historical Society. p. 2. Retrieved Sept. 25, 2010. All these companies were major suppliers of potash during World War I. With the factories came work and by spring of 1918, Antioch had grown into a small city with a population of over 5,000 people. The potash from Antioch was used during the war in the production of fertilizer, Epsom Salts, soda, and other products. The land on which the factories in Antioch had been built were state-owned, and the government's leasing them to private companies attracted public scrutiny. To combat the rumors of favoritism, the Nebraska Secretary of State and Nebraska State Land Commissioner issued a press release claiming that they had leased the land privately rather than publicly to avoid delay because \\"our country needs the product for munitions.\\" Potash was not used in munitions, but the public generally accepted the falsehood as fact. Antioch potash historical marker When Germany and France resumed trade with the United States in 1921, the potash trade was decimated. German and French potash was cheaper to produce than Nebraska potash and thus destroyed the market for American-made potash. The factories immediately closed. The machinery was sold for scrap; the factories were demolished for the salvage value of the building materials; and the company housing was torn down or moved. Only the foundations of the factories and of some of the larger houses remained.Jensen, Richard E. \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory-- Nomination Form: Antioch Potash Plants\\".

The film takes place in postwar Japan, following a Japanese clan through their wedding and funeral ceremonies, and the lengths the family goes to preserve their traditions in spite of the damage it causes to the younger generations.  Plot  The film begins with Masuo Sakurada receiving a telegram from his cousin Terumichi. He is traveling with his cousin Ritsuko to check out his cabin and see if the telegram is true. Masuo has a flashback to the ceremony on the first anniversary of his father's death, after he and his mother are repatriated to Japan from Huludao. Because his younger brother died before they returned from the former Manchukuo, Masuo is expected to live for two sons. Throughout each of the ceremonies, the tangled family web is revealed, with numerous instances of incest that make the relationships between each of the family members somewhat unclear. The continued incest is not only expected amongst the family. Masuo himself is interested in Setsuko, and later Ritsuko, and finds himself in competition with Terumichi for them. Masuo finds himself sacrificing much of his freedom for the family. He has a talent for baseball, but gives it up when his mother dies and he is not present. He burns all of his baseball possessions except his glove. His sacrifice reaches its climax when he goes through a marriage ceremony to an absentee bride at his grandfather's insistence. He finally releases his frustration and hatred for his grandfather afterward. His grandfather dies years later, and at his memorial service Masuo is asked by his uncles to marry as quickly as possible to have another heir to the family lineage. Masuo and Ritsuko finally arrive at Terumichi's cabin in the film's final segment, to discover that the telegram informing them of Terumichi's death is true. Ritsuko feels an obligation to commit suicide next to Terumichi, because he had been her lover. Masuo leaves the scene, and outside has a flashback to a childhood memory of playing baseball with his cousins and Setsuko, who have all died.  Cast  * Nobuko Otowa as Sakurada Shizu * Kenzo Kawarasaki as Masuo * Kei Sat≈ç as Kazuomi, Grandfather * Atsuko Kaku as Ritsuko * Atsuo Nakamura as Terumichi * Akiko Koyama as Setsuko * Fumio Watanabe as Susumu * Kiyoshi Tsuchiya as Tadashi * Hosei Komatsu as Sakurada Isamu * Rokko Toura as Sakurada Mamoru * Eitaro Ozawa as Tachibana Takeyo Production =Themes and interpretations= The Ceremony, like many other ≈åshima films, is often seen as a social critique of Japanese society. One of the most important themes in the film is that of the clan's attempt to look prosperous on the outside, while it is secretly falling apart from within. In his article on Nagisa ≈åshima at Senses of Cinema, Nelson Kim makes the case that this is showing how Japan in and of itself is \\"trapped between past and present\\", with an older generation stuck in their ways and a younger generation afraid to speak up. Any attempt at changing of the social order is quelled. This is seen best with the character of Tadashi, a far right nationalist sympathizer who coincidentally dies after attempting to interrupt Masuo's wedding ceremony. The film also shows the lengths that the Sakurada clan goes to preserve traditions, and how they negatively affect the younger generations. This is best seen in Masuo's wedding scene, in which his bride does not appear. Rather than canceling the wedding, Kazuomi insists that the ceremony go through as planned, with Masuo facing the embarrassment of having to marry a nonexistent bride. The incest committed within the family is also a recurring critique of Japanese society. The clan's obsession with inbreeding to keep the family line pure is a reflection of the conformity and xenophobia in Japanese Society. Xenophobia is also satirized again at Masuo's wedding ceremony, when a relative of the absent bride is giving a speech on how this nonexistent girl is a \\"perfect and pure Japanese girl\\" who has been untainted by foreign influence. A recurring scene in the film involves Masuo putting his ear to the ground. The first time the scene is shown, he explains that he is listening for his brother, who was buried alive in northeast China. This is repeated the night before Setsuko's death, and again at the end of the film. This gesture becomes a metaphor for the backward morality and that has crippled the humanity of the Sakurada clan. =Style and form= The Ceremony has a nonlinear narrative, jumping back and forth between the present, with Masuo and Ritsuko heading out to find Terumichi, and the past, all the weddings and funerals Masuo attended through his life. Masuo often delivers voice-over narration directed to his relatives about his regrets of the past and his feelings of how they affected his life. The musical score appears mostly during the present day sequences between Masuo and Ritsuko, or in sequences which would otherwise be silent. The ceremonies in the past usually do not have any musical accompaniment. ≈åshima and cinematographer Toichiru Narushima often make use of symmetrical framing and wide-angle lenses, and throughout each ceremony often track the camera in toward individuals who are talking. In wider shots within the ceremonies, the camera often focuses on one side of the clan's seating arrangement at the ceremony, framed so that everyone in the frame is facing the same direction, similar to the family meal scene at the end of Yasujir≈ç Ozu's Tokyo Story. The Ceremony makes use of many long takes. Some of the more private conversations during the ceremonies are played out throughout static long takes, with none of the characters moving around the screen. Wide-angle tracking shots are often used to help establish locations, as the film does not make usage of the 180 degree rule in its editing.

Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: \\"dog\\" and \\"bone\\" will appear more often in documents about dogs, \\"cat\\" and \\"meow\\" will appear in documents about cats, and \\"the\\" and \\"is\\" will appear approximately equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The \\"topics\\" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document's balance of topics is. Topic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body. In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies. Originally developed as a text-mining tool, topic models have been used to detect instructive structures in data such as genetic information, images, and networks. They also have applications in other fields such as bioinformatics and computer vision.Cao, Liangliang, and Li Fei-Fei. \\"Spatially coherent latent topic model for concurrent segmentation and classification of objects and scenes.\\" 2007 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer Vision. IEEE, 2007. History An early topic model was described by Papadimitriou, Raghavan, Tamaki and Vempala in 1998. Another one, called probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), was created by Thomas Hofmann in 1999. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), perhaps the most common topic model currently in use, is a generalization of PLSA. Developed by David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan in 2002, LDA introduces sparse Dirichlet prior distributions over document-topic and topic- word distributions, encoding the intuition that documents cover a small number of topics and that topics often use a small number of words. Other topic models are generally extensions on LDA, such as Pachinko allocation, which improves on LDA by modeling correlations between topics in addition to the word correlations which constitute topics. Hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) is an alternative to LDA, which models word co-occurrence using a tree of latent variables and the states of the latent variables, which correspond to soft clusters of documents, are interpreted as topics. Animation of the topic detection process in a document-word matrix. Every column corresponds to a document, every row to a word. A cell stores the frequency of a word in a document, dark cells indicate high word frequencies. Topic models group both documents, which use similar words, as well as words which occur in a similar set of documents. The resulting patterns are called \\"topics\\".http://topicmodels.west.uni-koblenz.de/ckling/tmt/svd_ap.html Topic models for context information Approaches for temporal information include Block and Newman's determination of the temporal dynamics of topics in the Pennsylvania Gazette during 1728‚Äì1800. Griffiths & Steyvers used topic modeling on abstracts from the journal PNAS to identify topics that rose or fell in popularity from 1991 to 2001 whereas Lamba & Madhusushan used topic modeling on full-text research articles retrieved from DJLIT journal from 1981‚Äì2018. In the field of library and information science, Lamba & Madhusudhan applied topic modeling on different Indian resources like journal articles and electronic theses and resources (ETDs). Nelson has been analyzing change in topics over time in the Richmond Times-Dispatch to understand social and political changes and continuities in Richmond during the American Civil War. Yang, Torget and Mihalcea applied topic modeling methods to newspapers from 1829‚Äì2008. Mimno used topic modelling with 24 journals on classical philology and archaeology spanning 150 years to look at how topics in the journals change over time and how the journals become more different or similar over time. Yin et al. introduced a topic model for geographically distributed documents, where document positions are explained by latent regions which are detected during inference. Chang and Blei included network information between linked documents in the relational topic model, to model the links between websites. The author-topic model by Rosen-Zvi et al. models the topics associated with authors of documents to improve the topic detection for documents with authorship information. HLTA was applied to a collection of recent research papers published at major AI and Machine Learning venues. The resulting model is called The AI Tree. The resulting topics are used to index the papers at aipano.cse.ust.hk to help researchers track research trends and identify papers to read, and help conference organizers and journal editors identify reviewers for submissions. Algorithms In practice, researchers attempt to fit appropriate model parameters to the data corpus using one of several heuristics for maximum likelihood fit. A recent survey by Blei describes this suite of algorithms. Several groups of researchers starting with Papadimitriou et al. have attempted to design algorithms with probable guarantees. Assuming that the data were actually generated by the model in question, they try to design algorithms that probably find the model that was used to create the data. Techniques used here include singular value decomposition (SVD) and the method of moments. In 2012 an algorithm based upon non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was introduced that also generalizes to topic models with correlations among topics. In 2018 a new approach to topic models emerged and was based on Stochastic block model  Topic models outside texts  Topic models are being used also in other contexts. For examples emerged uses of topic models in biology and bioinformatics research. In this case topics are biological latent variables to be inferred.

In addition to serving as a venue for slalom races and training, the center offers a range of services to the general public including guided raft trips, inflatable kayak rentals, and riverboard rentals.left The center opened in May 2007, constructed at a cost of $24 million, and is the third pump-powered artificial whitewater facility built in North America.The first, Dickerson Whitewater Course, built in a converted industrial water channel, uses the cooling-water pumps of the Dickerson Generating Station. The second, U.S. National Whitewater Center, in Charlotte, North Carolina, was the first designed solely for recreation. Its educational partner in water sports instruction is the Adventuresports Institute of nearby Garrett College, which offers degrees in outdoor adventure sports. History The concept of Adventure Sports Center International (ASCI) originated after the 1989 Whitewater Slalom World Championships on the remote Savage River in Western Maryland. Sergi Orsi, then president of the International Canoe Federation encouraged the organizers of the 1989 Savage River event to build a pump- powered artificial whitewater course in a more accessible location nearby. The Maryland state government supported the project to promote summer tourism in the region. Since the Wisp Ski Resort already had a pump-filled mountaintop reservoir to supply its snowmaking machines with water in the winter, the artificial whitewater course was sited next to this reservoir to make use of its water in the summer. The roads, motels, and restaurants which served the ski area in the winter made the location accessible to summer visitors. In April, 2011, ASCI was chosen as the site for the 2014 World Championship slalom competition. The races were held on September 16‚Äì21.Sports Center Wins Bid to Host 2014 World Champs Retrieved 2011-05-11 A number of modifications were made for the 2014 competition, including two boulder removals and several streambed changes. Course Design left The course plans were drawn by the McLaughlin Whitewater Design Group, architects of the Ocoee Whitewater Center, which served as the canoe slalom venue for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The Ocoee facility is the only Olympic whitewater venue built in a riverbed, using natural boulders to direct the water flow, and McLaughlin used a similar design here‚Äîwith a channel shaped like a natural streambed and lined with natural boulders blasted from the mountaintop. The purpose was both aesthetic and practical. Irregular surfaces dampen the water surges that can occur in geometrically regular artificial channels. right The first 100 meters of the course originally began with a stream-wide drop from the start pool and a split around a \\"Dark Destroyer\\" boulder in the middle of the stream. However, in the winter of 2013 the top drop was narrowed and moved back into the start pool, reducing the slope, and the mid-stream boulder was removed. The next three drops were modified with underwater speed bumps to slow down the water and reduce surges. The first 100 meters remains the steepest and narrowest part of the course, but it is now more a pool-drop stream than a continuous rapid.The absence of the mid-stream boulder is evident in this July 2013 video. Retrieved 2013-09-21. At any point swimmers can escape the current and swim ashore. The last 280 meters of the course, starting at the lower bridge beyond the 300-meter competition section, is a practice area with easy put-in and take-out on either shore. The last feature is a spillway drop into the lower pool. A conveyor belt carries boats and paddlers back to the start pool. To create standing waves for freestyle (rodeo) competition, hydraulically adjustable wave shaping plates were placed under the water in six locations: two where pump-driven water enters the start pool, and one at the bottom of each of the four concrete-walled spillway drops. Jimmy Blakeney, 2003 U.S. National Freestyle Kayak Champion, assisted in the final design of the wave shapers.

Setting This area consists of rolling grassy hills and river valleys of the Rocky Mountains foothills in the US state of Montana and the Canadian province of Alberta. The area largely consists of the Rocky Mountain Front, where the Great Plains rise to meet the Rockies, and is thus near the Continental Divide. The foothills are drained by the upper Missouri River and the Clark Fork/Bitterroot River systems among others. The ecoregion also contains outlying disconnected areas of similar habitat such as valleys of the Bow River in Alberta. The area has a moderate climate, warmed by the Chinook wind which brings dry, warm summers (average 14¬∞C) and winters that are mild for this latitude (ave. -8¬∞C). Flora While the dominant vegetation are grasses such as rough fescue with Parry's oatgrass and Koeleria (June grasses) the foothills are rich in plant life with, for example, 487 species of plant counted in southwest Montana's Centennial Valley. The ecoregion also contains sagebrush country in the higher and drier valleys in the rain shadow of the Rockies such as the upper Madison, Ruby and Red Rock Rivers, which are a similar habitat to the neighbouring Snake-Columbia shrub steppe ecoregion. Finally the ecoregion contains parts of the Prairie Pothole Region, large areas of wetland and rich grass on the Rocky Mountain Front steppe. Traditionally the grassland was reduced and then renewed by a combination of heavy grazing by bison and other ungulates and regular fires. Fauna The traditional wildlife of this area of included the large herds American bison, elk and bighorn sheep observed during the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the early 19th century but which now remain in small numbers only. Another iconic mammal found here are the grizzly bears, which come down from the mountainsides to forage in the rich habitats of rivers and grasslands. This is the last remaining area in the United States where grizzlies come down to the Great Plains. Other mammals of the valleys include White-tailed deer, wolves, mountain lions, mule deer, pronghorn and ground squirrels. Birds spotted in the Centennial Valley for example include grouse, sandhill crane and trumpeter swan. Threats and preservation About 25% of the original grassland remains (less than 10% in Canada) and continues to decrease due to the rapid growth of the Rockies' population. Expansion of cities in both Montana and Alberta is removing habitat and blocking the movements of native species including grizzly bears, elk, mule deer and others. Growth is most intense in southwestern Montana, specifically in the Bitterroot Valley around Missoula and the area just north of Yellowstone National Park along the Gallatin River, namely in Bozeman and the resort town of Big Sky, and the Yellowstone River in Paradise Valley. The area contains the largest and most expensive Superfund toxic waste site in the United States. The Clark Fork River Superfund Complex consists of three major sites along a 120 mile stretch of the Clark Fork River. It includes the Berkeley Pit, a former copper mine one mile across that now holds heavily acidic (pH = 2.5) water 900 feet in depth. Areas of relatively intact grassland and wetland on the Rocky Mountain Front include the Pine Butte Swamp Preserve near Choteau, Montana, parts of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, and a number of other hills and valleys of southwestern Montana including the Centennial Mountains, the Big Hole River and parts of the Madison River valleys. Protected areas include Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in Centennial Valley, Pine Butte Swamp, the National Bison Range in western Montana and a number of Bureau of Land Management wilderness study areas.

The play is set during the French Revolution and is one of seven Sardou plays set in that period. The plot follows a young actor, Labussi√®re (based on a historical person), who infiltrates the revolutionary Committee of Public Safety and saves its potential victims by destroying their files. This plot is set against the revolt of 27 July 1794 known as the Thermidorian Reaction. Performances It was first staged on January 24, 1891Sardou and the Sardou plays, Jerome Alfred Hart, page 100 at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise with sets and costumes designed by the author, and executed by Eug√®ne Carpezat, Philippe Chaperon, and others. In the next performance, on the 26th, radical Republican members of the audience took offense at Sardou's criticism of Maximilien Robespierre. They became threatening to the point of riot, with noise, confusion, shouted threats to Sardou's life, and police finally called to clear the crowd away.New York Times, February 15, 1891 The protesters were led by the socialist newspaper editor Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray and included the deputy Eug√®ne Baudin. The government of President Carnot prohibited the production from all state-funded venues. It would reopen years later, March 3, 1896, at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin, again starring Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin. The play is named for the eleventh month of the French Republican calendar. Auguste Escoffier's Lobster Thermidor is named in honour of the play. Synopsis Act I It is the era of the French Revolution, just before the fall of Robespierre. It is five in the morning, the month July (Thermidor), and on the banks of the River Seine in Paris, between the Isle Louvier and the Arsenal, the washerwomen come to rinse and beetle soiled linen. Citizen Labussi√®re, a former actor who has been appointed Registering Clerk to the Committee of Public Safety, comes to the banks of the Seine, accompanied by Lupin, for a purpose which requires the utmost secrecy. They meet an amateur fisherman who has come out at that early hour to avoid the reproaches of his wife. She is enraged at his conduct at the theatre the evening before when he applauded the hero of the play. The hero had denounced his wife because she pitied the victims of the guillotine. Labussi√®re sends up the fisherman by leading him to complain about those who keep up the fashion of wearing powder in their hair while flour is so scarce that famine is imminent, and by reminding him that Robespierre himself always goes powdered. The fisherman is alarmed, and Lupin advises him to make himself scarce at once, which he does hastily. As Labussi√®re and Lupin are preparing to perform their secret task they are again interrupted by an artillery officer, one Martial Hujon. Labussi√®re recognizes Martial as a former school-fellow and comrade in the army. Labussi√®re sends Lupin over to the Isle Louviers to finish the work in hand, and remains conversing with Martial. Martial tells him that he is trying to find a young girl and novice of the Ursuline Convent named Fabienne. Last winter he rescued her from freezing to death when she was made homeless because of the suppression of the convent. Martial protected her and intended to marry her but his regiment was ordered abroad and they were forced to part for the time being. He had been wounded in the 1794 Battle of Fleurus, had been imprisoned and then exchanged, and returned bearing the colours won from the enemy. He presented the colours to Citizen Lazare Carnot whom he recognized as a former comrade in the Light Infantry. He was warmly received. Fabienne had disappeared and the friends with whom he left her had been executed. He searched for her everywhere, and at last saw her among the washerwomen on the banks of the Seine, but she disappeared into the crowd and now he can find no trace of her. He and Labussi√®re lament the loss of the great men of the Revolution and the tyranny of Robespierre and his associates. Lupin returns, announcing that the purpose for which he and Labussi√®re had come had been achieved. They are about to depart when a frightful commotion is heard. Fabienne is seen surrounded by washerwomen who are about to throw her into the Seine because on hearing of the execution of an old abbess and a nun by the guillotine she had cried: \\"Jesus, what a horror!\\" The mob is led by a bully named Fran√ßoise. Fabienne is about to be drowned when Labussi√®re and Martial interpose. Labussi√®re points out to the mob that Fabienne cannot be an aristocrat since she is engaged to marry Martial, who is a soldier of the Republic and a hero of the Battle of Fleurus. The girl is released but ordered to cry: \\"Death to all aristocrats!\\" This she refuses to do, saying that she does not wish the death of anybody. The infuriated mob calls an agent of Robespierre, one Pourvoyer, to arrest Fabienne. Labussi√®re orders Martial to keep quiet and leave all to him. The agent is carrying her off when Labussi√®re puts on a hectoring air and on being asked for his card of citizenship, he calls Pourvoyer a dog and asks by what right he dares to demand it. Alarmed by the masterful manner of Labussi√®re, Pourvoyer jumps to the conclusion that he must be a person in authority. He cringes before him and lays the blame on Fran√ßoise and the women. The women, on hearing that Labussi√®re is in the employ of the Committee of Public Safety are terribly frightened and beg for pardon, vehemently crying out: \\"Pardon, citizen, pardon!\\" while Fran√ßoise adds, penitently: \\"Health and Fraternity!\\" to which Labussi√®re answers, with covert satire: \\"And Death!\\" Act II Jacqueline is a costumer and B√©rillon is a lamplighter at the theatre in which Labussi√®re used to act, and are great friends of his. Jacqueline is dusting and arranging things in the room. Her husband, Jacques B√©rillon is also a revolutionary soldier. He calls her by her classic name of \\"Carmagnole,\\" which she refuses to answer to. She in turn mocks his antique surname of \\"Casca\\" and scoffs at the idea of rechristening their little boy Joseph by the terrible title of \\"√áa Ira,\\" a quotation from a French revolutionary song which B√©rillon has adopted to hide his own apathy and cowardice. After a long discussion on the difficulties of the times and their mutual hopes, B√©rillon goes out to attend a meeting of the Convention to keep up his reputation as a true sans- culotte. As soon as he has gone Labussi√®re comes in, accompanied by Martial and Fabienne. Labussi√®re describes to Jacqueline what happened at the river and requests her to receive Fabienne and be a mother to her. Jacqueline gladly promises to do so. Fabienne tells that after the departure of Martial and the loss of her home and friends, she was cast upon the world. By chance, she met Sister Marie-Th√©r√©se of the Ursuline Convent in the church of Notre Dame. The nave of the church was despoiled and turned into a store for barrels of wine and liquor. Sister Marie-Th√©r√©se had come into the church, like Fabienne, to pray due to the imminent peril of their lives. The sister, pitying the poor girl's sad condition was taking her home when she met Mother Angelique and ten other sisters, together with a novice. The women lived together, Fabienne assuming the household duties. It was in going to wash their linen that she was assaulted by the washerwomen and rescued by Labussi√®re and Martial. After some talk, political and theatrical, Labussi√®re tells them that he has retired temporarily from the stage because of a quarrel with a fellow actor who had denounced one of his companions. Labussi√®re had assaulted the denouncer during rehearsal. Jacqueline, left desolate by B√©rillon‚Äôs military and political avocations, leaves to attend to the shop. Fabienne expresses her gratitude to Labussi√®re and learns that his position as Clerk of the Committee of Safety saved her life. Martial and Fabienne are disturbed when Labussi√®re tells them that he was once in charge of registering condemned aristocrats. He explains that he had opportunities to save some of their lives, especially some members of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise who had been denounced. This reconciled him in a measure to the horrors of his office. He also congratulates himself on his talent as a comedian which has enabled him to deceive his superiors and to carry out his designs. Fabienne, hearing the mention of Chief of Police H√©ron, tells them that H√©ron had married a woman of St. Malo before the Revolution who had been a servant in Fabienne's mother's house. He was a stableman. When turned out of the convent, Fabienne had called on the woman but she was not at home and H√©ron received her. He was tipsy and talked insolently to her, glorying in the downfall of her family and telling her, grossly, that she would be glad to clean his wife's shoes now. He drew her to him and she pushed him away. He was insulted and when he fell down because of his drunkenness, she fled the house. Labussi√®re is very much alarmed at this and asks Fabienne to disguise herself in a peasant girl's costume which Jacqueline provides from the theatre wardrobe. Fabienne reluctantly puts on the costume. He then advises Martial to change his regimentals for a plain suit of clothes, saying that H√©ron will try to be revenged. Should he call for Pourvoyer, his agent, they would be recognised as Martial and Fabienne and would be denounced for the insult to H√©ron. While Fabienne changes her dress Labussi√®re tells Martial that he must take Fabienne to Brussels and marry her for their own safety. Martial says he was only too willing, but that he fears that her affection for him has died out during his long absence. Labussi√®re laughs at the notion and quits him to go and order dinner before their departure. When Martial proposes this plan to Fabienne she is terribly agitated and distressed, and after much pressing she confesses that despairing of ever seeing Martial again and believing him to be dead she has taken the final vow and is now Sister Mary Magdalene. A long scene ensues in which after much argument and persuasion Fabienne's love overcomes her sense of duty to religion, and she consents to flee with and marry Martial. She sends a letter to the nuns informing them of her decision. Martial now goes to keep an appointment with Labussi√®re. To the horror and terror of Jacqueline and Fabienne, a procession is seen carrying Mother Angelique and the other nuns to prison. A police officer named Bouchard accuses Fabienne of having written the letter to the nuns as a way of warning them of their imminent arrest. She is immediately carried off, saying \\"It is not I that am to be pitied, but you.\\" Act III In the office of the Registry of Prisoners (a dismantled room in Tuileries) the officials are assembled, waiting for Labussi√®re. They are all anxious to go to the sitting of the National Convention, knowing that Robespierre will attempt to make himself an autocrat. They quarrel among themselves, taking different sides and on the arrival of Labussi√®re they all rush off to the Convention, leaving him in charge of the office. They caution him to have the papers of the condemned all ready as the scaffold would not be at work that day, but would be glutted with victims the day after. Martial comes to keep his appointment with Labussi√®re and announces to him that Fabienne has consented to be his wife. Marteau comes in with news that a jail delivery will take place tomorrow. He brings a supplementary list of victims, among which is the name of Fabienne Lecoulteux. H√©ron has accused a girl of attempting to assassinate him and that she too has been arrested. They conclude that Martial's Fabienne is H√©ron‚Äôs accused. As soon as Marteau leaves, Martial pleads with Labussi√®re to substitute one of three women with the name Fabienne Lecoulteux for his Fabienne. One is a woman of the streets, another is a woman of eighty-one years of age, and yet another, the mother of a family. Labussi√®re struggles with the decision while the determination of Martial is to save Fabienne at any cost. Lupin comes in and tells them that the discussion in the Convention is coming to a crisis and Robespierre is becoming furious at the opposition to his authority and plans. He also says that Fouquier Tinville has declared that he is tired of Labussi√®re‚Äôs continual mislaying of the lists of the condemned and that he will hold him responsible in future‚Äîin fact, if Labussi√®re does not make out his lists more accurately, he may make out his own condemnation. In the midst of Labussi√®re‚Äôs struggle between official duty and his friendship with Martial, the officials return in confusion, crying out that Robespierre has fallen and has been arrested, together with Marteau, Couthon and Saint- Just. Cries are heard in the streets as Robespierre and his associates are conveyed to the Committee of Public Safety. The infuriated people howl out: \\"Down with Robespierre! Down with the tyrant!\\" and the officials join in the cry: \\"Death to Robespierre! Long live the Republic!\\" while a voice outside answers: \\"Long live the Republic!\\" At that moment the crier's voice is heard outside: \\"Demand that Robespierre be outlawed together with his accomplices! Demand that he and they be arrested and tried!\\" The beat of the soldiers' drums is heard in the distance as the tumbrels advance, bearing Fabienne to her death. Act IV In the lesser court of the Conciergerie, Debrun, Brault and others, jailers, turn-keys, National Guards, gendarmes and executioners, including the Chief Headsman, Sanson, are waiting to send the tumbrels containing the condemned prisoners forth to the guillotine. Brault's daughter is watering her flowers at a window. All are talking about the late events and wondering what has been done with Robespierre, some being in his favour, others against him. Labussi√®re and Martial enter, searching for Fabienne. Labussi√®re is known to all as a government official, and has specially recommended himself to Madame and Mademoiselle Brault (the wife and daughter of the head jailer) by giving them free tickets to the theatre. Through them a note is conveyed to Fabienne, a letter and a flower, bidding Martial an eternal farewell and telling him that the sight of her companion nuns going to prison has recalled her to her religious duty, and that they must wait to meet in heaven. Tavernier enters and tells how the President of the Convention, Citizen Ren√©- Fran√ßois Dumas has been arrested on the bench, by order of the Committee of Public Safety. Labussi√®re and Martial take heart, supposing that the condemnations of the accused will be put off till the immediate matters in the Convention shall be settled. This hope, however, is frustrated by an announcement that the President's chair has been taken by Citizen Maire and the trial of the prisoners has gone forward and the condemned are to be taken to the place of execution in the tumbrels. Labussi√®re endeavours to delay the fatal procession to the guillotine by saying that in so uncertain a time, it would be a fearful risk to send the prisoners to execution until it was certain that Dumas was restored to power or executed himself. Fouquier Tinville, dining out with a friend, orders the tumbrels to proceed on their way despite the uncertainty. An inspiration then seizes Labussi√®re who declares that Fabienne is a nun who has broken her vows for the sake of her lover, Martial, and is entitled to stay of execution because she is pregnant. Fabienne indignantly refuses to sign a document to this effect and upbraids Martial with trying to dishonour her in the eyes of God and of the world. Fran√ßoise and the other women strive hard to persuade her, but in vain. The beat of the soldiers' drums is played for the tumbrels to start at once. Martial then, in despair, swears that he is the father of the unborn child, and Fran√ßoise testifies to the truth of his assertion. Fabienne, however, swears that she is a pure virgin and a nun, and calls Martial a liar, although confessing her love for him, ending by exclaiming: \\"Farewell, and thanks for what you have done for me! My dearest Martial, I may now love you without sin!\\" She is borne off to execution. Martial, driven to despair, rushes to drag her from the tumbrel, but is shot by Tavernier and falls dead, his last word being: \\"Fabienne.\\" Critic's review \\"Realism has never been brought to greater perfection. The howling of the mob, the tocsin, the revolting sayings and jests, are marvellously depicted. An epoch cannot be more strikingly and faithfully delineated. The piece is a denunciation of the terror which even now finds a few defenders and perhaps would-be repeaters, but there is nothing new in this indictment\\" (On the original production of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise).

The fruit bodies of the fungus are highly toxic, and have been responsible for several fatalities in Japan. The fungus contains several trichothecene mycotoxins. Taxonomy The species was originally described as Hypocrea cornu-damae by Narcisse Th√©ophile Patouillard in 1895, and later transferred to the genus Podocrea in 1905 by Pier Andrea Saccardo. In 1994 Japanese mycologists Tsuguo Hongo and Masana Izawa placed the species in the genus Podostroma. Range The fungus was once thought to be only native to Korea and Japan, but recent discoveries have been made in Java, Papua and northern Australia. Description The conidiophores (specialized fungal hyphae that produce conidia) are up to 400 Œºm high and about 2‚Äì4 Œºm wide in the main axial hyphae. The phialides are arranged in tufts with narrow angles at the top, similar to the branching hyphae found in Trichoderma species. The conidia are roughly spherical with a truncate base in each spore, pale green in color, and measure 2.5‚Äì3.5 Œºm in diameter. Their surfaces are almost smooth, but sometimes appearing very faintly roughened with light microscopy. Toxicity 200px Several poisonings have been reported in Japan resulting from the consumption of the fungus. In 1999, one of a group of five people from Niigata prefecture died two days after consuming about of fruit body that had been soaked in sake. In 2000, an individual from Gunma prefecture died after eating the fried mushroom. Symptoms associated with consumption in these cases included stomach pains, changes in perception, decrease in the number of leukocytes and thrombocytes, peeling skin on the face, hair loss, and shrinking of the cerebellum, resulting in speech impediment and problems with voluntary movement. In another instance, an autopsy revealed multiple organ failure, including acute kidney failure, liver necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In one case of poisoning, the patient suffered from hemophagocytosis, in addition to severe leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, seven days after ingesting the fungus. Plasmapheresis and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were used to treat the blood abnormalities. The authors suggested that these treatments, in addition to the large volume of administered intravenous saline - over a 12-hour period‚Äîwere responsible for his successful recovery. The poisoning symptoms are similar to those observed previously with animals that had consumed trichothecene mycotoxins. Japanese researchers detected the presence of the macrocyclic trichothecenes satratoxin H, satratoxin H 12‚Ä≤,13‚Ä≤-diacetate, satratoxin H 12‚Ä≤-acetate, and satratoxin H 13‚Ä≤-acetate. When grown in liquid culture the fungus additionally produces roridin E, verrucarin J, and satratoxin H. With the exception of verrucarin J, a 500-microgram dose of any of these compounds, when injected into the abdomen of mice, will result in their death the following day. It has been claimed that touching the fungus can cause skin irritation, but this is controversial.

The genus Acacia is the largest genus of flowering plants in Australia, containing about 1000 species throughout a diverse range of environments from coast to desert. The word Acacia is thought to have been derived from a Greek word for sharpen, and lineata from a Latin word meaning marked by fine parallel lines . Currently A. lineata is not considered rare or endangered, but it is considered uncommon in Victoria.  Description  Acacia lineata grows into a bushy, low spreading shrub 0.5-2m high and 1-2.5m wide. Branchlets are round, hairy and resinous. It is a perennial. Like a lot of Acacias, the leaves of A. lineata are not true leaves, but a modified leaf stem known as a phyllode. The phyllodes of A. lineata are dark green, sparsely to densely hairy, often sticky, slightly clustered, tough and erect; ending in a small point 0.7-2.5cm long to 1-3mm wide. Margins are thick, there is a visible vein running lengthwise and a small gland near the base. The inflorescence is a bright yellow ball 4-6mm in diameter, containing 10-16 flowers on a slim stalk 2.5-10mm long (singly or in pairs), growing out from the base of the phyllodes. The seed pod or legumes are curved and can be flat or twisted, 2-6cm long and 2-4mm wide, turning from green to a dark brown when mature and papery in texture. They are slightly hairy and sticky. Seeds are greyish/black, 3 to 5mm long, oblong shaped and spaced length-ways within the legume; with flattened sections separated each seed from another. The seed- terminal is short, folded and widens into a pale aril.  Taxonomy  A. lineata belongs to the Family Fabaceae also called the legume or pea family, in the Clade Mimosoidae. The following species are considered conspecific with A. lineata; A. impricata, A. flexifolia, A. runciformis and A. dasyphylla.  Distribution and Habitat  A. lineata has a sporadic distribution. It occurs in central to western New South Wales (NSW). It is has been noted to grow around the Killara Road area of the Narrandera Rangers NSW, and throughout the mallee areas north-east of Barellan NSW. It also known to occur in south-east Queensland (QLD), north-west Mallee areas of Victoria (VIC) and can be seen in south-east South Australia (SA); with known locations including the Yorke Peninsula region and Murray region . A. lineata growa in a variety of habitats such as sclerophyll forest and woodland, but mostly occurs in mallee communities.  Ecology  A. lineata can grow in alkaline, sandy, or gravely soils. Having phyllodes instead of leaves help A. lineate to survive in dry semi-arid environments, by reducing water loss. The phyllodes of A. lineatea are small, point up and are slightly hairy; adaptations that further reduce water loss. Acacias are able to fix nitrogen in the soil via a host bacteria that live on the roots called rhizobia, which aids in the growth of other plant species.  Reproduction and Dispersal  A. lineata flowers appear from July to October depending on the region, with seeds maturing over summer. The pale aril of the A. lineata seeds, suggests dispersal by ants.  Cultivation and Uses  A. lineata is planted as an ornamental shrub in parks and along roadsides. It prefers temperate regions, is moderately drought and frost tolerant, and will grow from a seed or cutting. Acacias are a good source of pollen; nesting habitat and seeds are eaten by birds. Indigenous Australians (hypo link) use many species of Acacia for a diverse range of purposes. A few include seeds and roots for food, wood for fire, tools, shelters etc, habitat to attract other foods (birds, kangaroos) and as a seasonal indicator.
