In the summer the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos sent troops under the commander Saktikios to repel another Bulgarian raid at the outskirts of the Byzantine capital. The Byzantines stormed the Bulgarian camp but were defeated when they confronted the main Bulgarian forces. During his flight from the battlefield Saktikios was mortally wounded and died the following night. The Bulgarians, who by 922 were in control of most of the Balkans, continued to ravage the Byzantine countryside virtually unopposed. However, they lacked the maritime power to conduct a successful siege of Constantinople. The subsequent attempts to negotiate a Bulgarian‚ÄìArab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople were discovered by the Byzantines and successfully countered. The strategic situation in the Balkans remained unchanged until both sides signed a peace treaty in 927, which recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate. The primary sources for the battle are the continuation of George Hamartolos' Chronicle and John Skylitzes' Synopsis of Histories.  Background  During his short reign the Byzantine emperor Alexander (r. 912‚Äì913) provoked a conflict with the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893‚Äì927). Simeon I, who had long harboured ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself, took the opportunity to wage war. With the Byzantine Empire in disarray following Alexander's death in June 913, the Bulgarians reached Constantinople unopposed and forced the regency of the infant Constantine VII (r. 913‚Äì959) to recognize Simeon I as emperor (in Bulgarian, Tsar). Following a palace coup in 914, the new Byzantine regency revoked the concessions to the Bulgarians and summoned the whole army, including the troops in Asia Minor, to deal with the Bulgarian threat once and all. In the decisive battle of Achelous in 917 the Byzantine forces were completely annihilated, leaving the Bulgarians in charge of the Balkans. Their annual campaigns reached the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth. All subsequent attempts to confront the Bulgarian army at Katasyrtai, Aquae Calidae and Pegae ended in defeat. Despite his military supremacy over land, Simeon I was aware that he needed naval assistance in order to seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate the assistance of the powerful Arab navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.  The battle  Manasses Chronicle. To distract the Byzantine attention from the secret negotiations with the Arabs, in the summer of 922 the Bulgarians launched a campaign in Eastern Thrace. They captured and garrisoned a number of fortified towns in the region, including Bizye. In June they reached the outskirts of Constantinople and burned the Palace of Theodora, situated on the shores of the Golden Horn. In response, emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920‚Äì944) summoned the commanders of the tagmata on a feast and urged them to confront the Bulgarians.\\"Continuation of the Chronicle of George Hamartolos\\" in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 146\\"Synopsis of Histories by John Skylitzes\\" in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 252 The following day one of them, Saktikios, led the assault against the Bulgarians. While most of the Bulgarian soldiers were dispersed to loot the countryside, the Byzantines attacked the Bulgarian camp and slaughtered the few defenders left there. When the main Bulgarian forces were informed about the attack, they headed back to the camp to engage the opponents. In the ensuing heavy struggle the Bulgarians prevailed and forced the Byzantines to flee despite the personal courage of Saktikios, who the Byzantine chroniclers claim to have \\"killed many\\". During the flight, the horse of Saktikios got stuck in the mud of a river and the Byzantine commander was wounded in the seat and the thigh. His soldiers managed to free the horse from the mud and to bring him to the Blachernae alive. Saktikios was laid in the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae, where he died the following night.\\"Synopsis of Histories by John Skylitzes\\" in GIBI, vol. VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 253  Aftermath  A map of Constantinople with the Golden Horn visible to the north and the Blachernae to the north-west. After the victory Simeon I sent letters to the Ecumenical Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and Romanos' co- emperor Constantine VII to propose peace negotiations. However, his intention was to prolong the negotiations until the return of his envoys to the Fatimids. While Simeon I and Nicholas Mystikos exchanged letters the military actions continued. In a few weeks the Bulgarian army captured Adrianople, the most important city in Byzantine Thrace. The fall of Adrianople raised fears in Constantinople that a Bulgarian assault of the city was imminent. The Byzantines tried to intimidate Simeon I by threatening to incite the Magyars, the Pechenegs and Kievan Rus' to attack Bulgaria from the north-east, as they had done in the war of 894‚Äì896. Simeon I knew that these were empty words because the Byzantine Empire was in no position to carry out these threats. In the meantime, the Bulgarian envoys received a warm welcome by al-Mahdi. The Fatimid caliph accepted the Bulgarian terms and sent his own emissaries to Simeon I. However, on the way back their ship was captured by the Byzantines, who managed to outbid the Bulgarians and distract a Fatimid attack. The Bulgarians remained in control of most of the Balkans, annexing Byzantium's ally Serbia in 924, but without naval support were unable to launch a decisive attack on Constantinople. The war continued until the death of Simeon I in 927, when his son Peter I (r. 927‚Äì969) concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines, who recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate in return for most of Simeon I's conquests in Thrace after 917.

It premiered on December 20, 1936, at the Guild Theatre in New York City. The set was designed by Isamu Noguchi. Riegger's music was scored for piano, wind instruments and percussion; Noguchi's set was made up primarily of curtains, platforms and stairs. The original production was danced by Martha Graham and Group, the forerunner of the Martha Graham Dance Company. According to the program notes, the dance is based upon \\"the advent and consequences of war\\" and concerned itself with the \\"contemporary situation\\", referring to the impending conflict in Europe.  Synopsis  Chronicle is more than an hour in length and chronicles the time frame from 1914 to 1936. It is divided into three major sections: Dances Before Catastrophe, which includes Spectre-1914 and Masque; Dances After Catastrophe, which includes Steps in the Street and Tragic Holiday-In Memoriam; and a final section Prelude to Action. Each section has been performed as an independent work. Steps in the Street was recreated in 1988. It is part of the current Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire. The opening solo Spectre-1914 is a prelude to the action that follows. The dancer moves with stiff, robotic gestures in response to off-stage drums and trumpet, an embodiment, perhaps, of the inevitability of marching off to war. In the subsequent section Masque, a soloist costumed in metallic gray holds forth to an audience of followers in a formal, \\"court-like\\" display. Steps in the Street, a long ensemble piece, suggests a mass of unwanted individuals, such as a group of the unemployed or homeless. The dancers shuffle dejectedly, occasionally rallying to execute rebellious gestures, and then return to their resigned trudging. Carrying a black flag, the soloist then leads the ensemble in a service of commemoration (Tragic Holiday-In Memoriam). The finale Prelude to Action depicts a call for \\"a brave new world\\".  Original cast  At the time, Graham's all-female troupe consisted of Anita Alvarez, Thelma Babbitz, Bonnie Bird, Dorothy Bird, Ethel Butler, Aza Ceskin, Jane Dudley, Frieda Flier, Marie Marchowsky, Sophie Maslow, Marjorie Mazia, May O'Donnell, Kathleen Slagle, Gertrude Schurr, Anna Sokolow and Mildred Wile.  Critical reception  Following the premiere, The New York Herald critic described Chronicle as superior to Panorama, \\"Miss Graham's previous attempt at an extended choreographic work with historical and sociological implications\\" and pointed \\"the way to brilliant future accomplishments\\" but did not fully succeed. \\"Many of the ideas are expressed at too great a length, and the suite, which requires about one and a quarter hours in the unfolding, would profit greatly by radical pruning.\\" From the \\"aspects of design and motion,\\" however, \\"Miss Graham and her group accomplish much that is remarkable. Considered merely as controlled, directed energy their efforts were amazing.\\" Graham reworked the ballet extensively between the first and second performances. The New York Times reviewer John Martin wrote that Graham \\"not only made revisions in its choreography and costuming, but actually managed to alter its general direction and manner of functioning.\\" Where the original dance was well made, Martin noted, it \\"projected no passion, irradiated no warmth.\\" In its \\"second incarnation\\" the critic described the opening solo as \\"ominous and gripping\\", Dances After Catastrophe as having \\"great power\\" and containing \\"under their surface of defeat and suffering the most eloquent indications of protest and rebellion.\\" Of the revised version Dance Observer's reporter wrote, \\"It is an ambitious undertaking, a composition on a grand scale, making enormous demands on both the soloist and her group,\\" while the critic for The Christian Science Monitor noted, \\"I found it deeply moving‚Ä¶and only seldom disappointing...The technical performance of this work, by both Miss Graham and the group, leaves you gasping.\\" The critic for The New York Sun compared Chronicle to Kurt Jooss' famous anti-war ballet The Green Table. The set and score were also praised. The set for its simplicity. The \\"plangent, percussive\\" score for its \\"composition, understanding of the text\\" and \\"excellent foreshadowing of the choreography.\\"  Steps in the Street  In 1988, the Graham company recreated Chronicle's middle section Steps in the Street. Subtitled Devastation - Homelessness - Exile, the dance is a portrait of the human condition born out of the Great Depression and of Graham's response to the Spanish Civil War. It references the plight of individuals suffering through hunger, poverty. and civil and labor unrest and presents a nihilistic view of war's destructiveness and isolating effects. Although the work does not employ sets, the sculptural lighting design enhances the geometric choreography. The twelve dancers' movements are stark, angular and percussive. They dance in groups, but never really together. Reviews of the re-staged work were positive. The New York Times dance critic wrote, \\"Why do early Graham works that have recently been revived look so fresh? Steps, which is obviously a fragment but a major fragment, provides the answer. Its form is completely abstract: the choreography is focused on one woman...who was constantly bypassed by lines of 12 other women in black...\\" She also noted that although the piece was made during a specific historical era, it has broader implications. \\"Miss Graham was dealing here with the aftermath of war but also with the loneliness that can well up in everyone, especially those alienated from society.\\" The New York Post dance critic agreed. \\"Seemingly picking up contrapuntal elements in Riegger‚Äôs score, the choreography conveys the desperation of the masses, the pain of isolation, the loneliness of despair.\\"  References  Category:1936 ballet premieres Category:Ballets by Martha Graham ","title":"Chronicle (ballet)"},{"id":"49474587","text":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a 1961 children's book written by Norton Juster.

Early life Lu Zongdao was orphaned during childhood, and he was raised by his maternal family. His maternal uncles were all soldiers devoted to his learning, and Lu Zongdao also studied very hard. After passing the imperial examination, Lu Zongdao was assigned to Dingyuan District (in Hao Prefecture) where he first assumed the position of a defender, later becoming the director of sea salt. To the southeast of the district was a sea harbor, but years of sediment had blocked the water flow. Lu Zongdao thus initiated a hydraulic engineering project in which laborers reconnected the harbor to the sea, and the harbor was then known as \\"Shore of Lord Lu\\". During Emperor Zhenzong's reign After Dingyuan, Lu Zongdao successively served as the military administrative assistant of She Prefecture and assistant director of the Palace Library. In 1017, due to an excellent record, Lu Zongdao was appointed \\"right exhorter\\", responsible for monitoring documents passing to and from the emperor and the Secretariat. Lu Zongdao had wanted to talk to the emperor about a multitude of issues, but the emperor was very annoyed by his frequent memorials. During an audience with the emperor, Lu Zongdao then said, :\\"Did your majesty appoint me only to pretend to take advice? Personally, I feel ashamed if I receive wages but do not perform my duties. So I ask your majesty to relieve me of my post.\\" The emperor thought about the matter for a long time. One day, missing Lu Zongdao, he wrote the characters \\"Honest Lu\\" (È≠ØÁõ¥; \\"Lu Zhi\\") on the palace wall. Lu Zongdao was further promoted to vice director of the Bureau of Revenue, while simultaneous serving as an adviser under the heir apparent (Zhao Zhen). At that time, Lu Zongdao lived close to a restaurant which he frequented to drink. Once, an imperial messenger carrying the emperor's urgent summon had to wait at his residence for a long time before Lu Zongdao returned from the restaurant. The messenger asked him what he would say if the emperor criticized his tardiness. Lu Zongdao replied that he would just tell the truth. The messenger warned him that he would be punished, but Lu Zongdao replied: :\\"Drinking wine is a normal human activity, but lying to the emperor is a great crime for a minister.\\" The messenger returned and reported what Lu said. When the emperor questioned him, Lu Zongdao replied: :\\"I had visitors arrive from my hometown. Because I am poor and do not own enough cups and plates in my house, I drank with them at the restaurant.\\" The emperor was impressed by his honesty. Therefore, he would frequently mention Lu Zongdao's name to his wife Empress Liu as someone trustworthy. During Empress Dowager Liu's regency Once, the empress dowager asked him what he thought of the infamous Empress Wu during the Tang dynasty.

It is the biggest non-profit consumer organization in North America representing passengers of commercial airlines. In 2011, FlyersRights.org pushed a rule through the U.S. Department Of Transportation, which expanded on passenger protections.  Current legislation  In 2015, FlyersRights.org drafted and filed a petition to the U.S. Congress calling for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to set guidelines for the minimum distance between rows in planes and appoint a committee to help develop benchmarks. Tens of thousands signed their names to the petition. In February 2016, Congressman Steve Cohen, (D-TN), introduced an amendment to a FAA funding bill called the Seat Egress in Air Travel which mandated a certain amount of legroom to passengers for safety, health and comfort. It was defeated in the House Transportation Committee. Two weeks later Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) also added an amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Bill requiring the agency to set the seat-size guidelines. In April 2016, The Senate voted down the amendment on a 54-to-42 vote, with most Democrats supporting the amendment and most Republicans opposed.

Legal work  Flyers Rights partnered with Travelers United to file an amicus curiae brief with the Supreme Court on December 20, 2016 in support of an injured passenger's appeal in Von Schoenebeck v. KLM.  Aviation Safety  FlyersRights.og has been critical of the FAA‚Äôs airplane certification process. In May 2013, in the aftermath of the Boeing 787 grounding due to lithium ion battery fires, FlyersRights.org, with independent experts, challenged the FAA‚Äôs preliminary fix as inadequate to prevent future fires or to warn pilots or ground crews of overheating batteries. FlyersRights.org proposed an ETOPS rating of 120 until the FAA could demonstrate the safety of the 787. In 2014, the NTSB would find that the FAA was too reliant on Boeing‚Äôs assertions of the battery‚Äôs safety. Meanwhile, Airbus announced it would avoid using Boeing‚Äôs lithium ion battery in its planes. When the FAA Flight Standardization Board recommended iPad training rather than simulator training for pilots of the grounded 737 MAX in April 2019, FlyersRights.org lobbied to extend the public comment period and argued for simulator training. Seven months later, Boeing announced that it would require simulator training for pilots. FlyersRights.org published a white paper on the 737 MAX‚Äôs design flaws and the problematic FAA certification process, including Boeing‚Äôs large role. FlyersRights.org recommended # Release of technical details of fix to outside experts for evaluation # Suspension of Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) # Criminal and civil prosecution of Boeing and its employees who hid or misrepresented dangerous conditions # Simulator training for pilots # Increased funding of FAA certification and safety oversight # Oath of office requirement for industry personnel with delegated authority and whistleblower and other employment protections In December 2019, FlyersRights.org sued the FAA for failure to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request for documents related to the FAA‚Äôs process for evaluating Boeing's proposed fixes to the 737 MAX.

History According to tradition (included in the Trono≈°a Chronicle), before the famous Battle of Kosovo (1389), the troops of Prince Lazar gathered and held a holy communion in the Samodre≈æa Church. Tradition further holds that Milo≈° Obiliƒá, the assassin of the Murad I, was buried in the church after the battle. The Church was desecrated and destroyed many times throughout its long history. In year of 1932, the church was rebuilt under the joint project of famous Serbian architects Petar Popoviƒá and Aleksandar Deroko. It was made of white marble hewn stone with purified forms and clear lines, with almost complete absence of decorations. During the works on the renovation of the church, nearby were found skeletons which were presumed to belong to the victims of the Battle of Kosovo. At the end of June 1999, after the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces and the arrival of French KFOR forces in the area, the church in Samodre≈æa was vandalized and burned by Albanians. The church was again under attack in 2004, also by Kosovar Albanians. The church's roof was destroyed, over the apse there is a large hole, glass windows and doors are broken, the bell tower and the wall around the church were destroyed (only the bell has been preserved and it is located in Zveƒçan). The interior has been turned into a rubbish dump and a toilet for people and livestock.

Early life  Jones was born October 24, 1832 in Dolwyddelan, North Wales, the son of Richard James Jones and Ann Jones. On September 2, 1845 Richard, Ann and family (5 boys and one girl) immigrated to the United States. Richard purchased 480 acres of government land east of the village of Cambria, Wisconsin. He built a log house and moved there in the spring of 1846. The farm was named Oakland. In May 1852, David R. left Oakland for the city of Racine, Wisconsin where he apprenticed with architect Lucas Bradley. His brother, Evan O. Jones, remained in Cambria and was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and Senate.  Architecture  Jones worked in Racine for about 4 years before he returned to Cambria. While in Cambria he designed and built many buildings in the area, along with maintaining a lumber yard. In 1871 he left Cambria to become the head draftsman for architect Abraham Radcliffe of St. Paul, Minnesota. In the spring of 1873, Jones returned to Wisconsin and started his own practice in Madison. He set up office on Main Street across from the Capitol. He maintained the office in Madison until 1885. In 1880 and 1881 Jones had a branch office in Racine Wisconsin. His head draftsman James Gilbert Chandler worked for him in the Racine office and later took over the business in 1882. One of his first commissions in Madison was a mansion for General David Atwood, the founder and publisher of the Wisconsin State Journal. Atwood wrote highly of Jones skill in his paper. Residences for other prominent Madisonians were soon to follow, Mayor Silas U. Pinney, Colonel C.G. Thorton, banker Lucien Hanks, and Judge Romanzo Bunn among others. Madison was becoming a resort city in the 1870s and 80s. Two of Jones commissions were in response to that. Jones designed the buildings for the Monona Lake Assembly Chautauqua and the Tonyawatha Resort Hotel during that time period. Much of his other work was for the Wisconsin State Government. He designed buildings for the Normal Schools at Whitewater, Platteville and River Falls. He also designed buildings at the Mendota Insane Asylum, University of Wisconsin Madison and the north and south wings of the Wisconsin Capitol Building. Jones had several students and employees within his firm. His students were Herman Esser, Owen J. Williams, and James G. Chandler. He employed Edward Stark, Frederick W. Paunach, William Kleinpell and J. Albert Swenon.  The capitol disaster  In the spring of 1882, the Wisconsin State Legislature approved $200,000 for the extension of the Wisconsin State Capitol. An architectural competition was held and Jones was awarded the commission. In May of that year bids were sought, with a project completion date of January 1, 1884. Twice the project went out for bids only to exceed the $200,000 approved by the state legislature. Twice Jones was requested to revise the plans in order to bring down the bids. One of the revisions eliminated the octagonal towers and the lower ranks of iron columns were replaced with stone piers. Eventually the firm of Bentley and Nowlan were the successful bidders with a bid of $188,370. By late 1883 the north wing was all but completed. The south wing had some additional work to be structurally complete. On November 8th, at 1:40 pm the south wing collapsed, trapping and killing 8 workmen and injuring many others. Immediately after, Governor Jeremiah Rusk called together a group of specialist to determine the cause. The group was made up of A.C. Nash, a prominent architect from Ohio, Godfrey Ludwig, the superintendent of public buildings for Cincinnati Ohio, C.F. Struck architect from Minneapolis, and J.R. Willett an architect from Chicago. Their report placed the blame on substandard materials, specifically the cast iron columns. The day after the disaster, a coroner‚Äôs inquest was impaneled. That inquest was led by Dane County District Attorney Robert M. La Follette. \\"The panel found Nowlan culpable of \\"improperly and insufficiently\\" repairing a fault in the second-story pier near the southeast corner of the extension, which they found to have contributed to the falling of the south wing. They also found D. R. Jones and a consulting Milwaukee architect, Henry C. Koch, guilty of negligence \\"in designing the internal construction of the said south wing of the Capitol Extension without a due and proper regard for the safety during the erection . . .\\"  The aftermath of the capitol disaster  After the collapse of the capitol, both the number and the scale of the projects declined for Jones. In 1885 Jones sold his Madison office to Owen J. Williams. Jones returned to Cambria where he continued to design buildings until just prior to his death. His post Madison works include buildings for the City of Portage Wisconsin (Fire Engine House and Council Room), Columbia County (Register of Deeds Building, Jail and Sheriffs House, Insane Asylum, Poor House), the State of Wisconsin and numerous churches and residences throughout south central Wisconsin. In 1893, Jones was hired by William H. Jones, President of the Plano Manufacturing Company, as the principal and supervising architect for the construction of a new manufacturing plant. When completed, the factory encompassed 25 acres of land in West Pullman, Illinois and employed 1400 workers. Jones worked on the project from 1893 to 1905. In 1902 the Plano Manufacturing Company merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, the Deering Harvester Company, and 2 other companies to form the International Harvester Company. Jones' last known building, the addition to the Cambria Wisconsin High School, was in 1911.

He wrote poetry for the newspaper ‚ÄòY Drych‚Äô and for local publications such as the Cambria News. Jones and his poetry were featured in the Cambrian, a magazine published in Utica New York. Jones had two books of poetry published, ‚ÄúHans Bywrd yr Han Lywyd‚Äù (1897) and ‚ÄúYr Ymchwilan y Galwuni‚Äù (1910). His unpublished works are in a collection at Bangor University in Wales UK.  Personal life  On October 30, 1857, Jones married Jane Williams of Welsh Prairie, Wisconsin. Four children were born from this union, (Mary, Margaret, Richard and Jane). Richard died in 1865, a year after his birth from scarlet fever. Though Richard‚Äôs death was painful for the entire family, it was especially difficult for David to lose his son. Six years later, his wife, Jane, died in 1871 while the family was living in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was left with his three daughters to mourn her loss. Jones moved back to Wisconsin in 1873. It was there that he met the woman that was to be his new bride. On December 24, 1878 he was married to Annie Roberts of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. She remained by his side until his death in 1915. Death David Richard Jones died February 16, 1915, at the age of 82 and is buried in the Cambria Cemetery along with his wives.

Plot The mysterious Patrick Garavan watches David Merkin, who is in a coma after a car accident. When the patient awakens, he desperately calls for his lover Annabelle, who has been killed. In retrospect, he sees the course of their relationship and how the tragedy came about. David was a writer whose first book was panned by critics. Annabelle liked it, however, and they began a tumultuous love affair. Inspired by his feelings, David wrote another book. He sent it to a young authors competition without giving his name. David didn't feel good enough for the elegant Annabelle, who was coveted as a good-looking photo model by men. He came across secret meetings in a French ch√¢teau and jealously suspected a rival. He snuck into the castle and inadvertently shot Mark Merylle when a shot went off from a pistol he dropped. David escaped from the crime scene. His girlfriend told him about her lucrative work for a perfume advertisement, about which she had to remain silent so far. Mark, a photographer, had taken erotic photos of her but had no affair with her. David still saw rivals everywhere and jealousy tormented him. His girlfriend was distraught over his suspicions. David's anonymous book won first prize in the competition and became a bestseller. Annabelle brought the disk that proved who the author was to Patrick, who she used to live with. He confronted her with a newspaper article in which David was wanted as Mark's murderer. Annabelle was at the end of her nerve. When she was driving with David in the car, she opened the door to leave him. This caused the car to skid and collide with an oncoming vehicle. The young woman was killed and David was admitted to the hospital seriously injured. When he wakes up, he leaves the hospital unrecognized. The bribed nurse informs Patrick immediately. He contacts David, and they meet in his castle for a psychological test of strength. Patrick pretends to be the real writer of the hit novel. With David's help, he wants to turn it into a script for a film and offers him money for it. Both present their different points of view on the plot. It is about love, desire and jealousy. David thinks Annabelle lives on in his book. He admits to be guilty of her and Mark's death. Patrick incites David's jealousy and shows him an erotic video in which Annabelle can be seen in bed with two naked men. David commits suicide with a pistol, to which Patrick manipulated him, because in reality Annabelle was not having an affair, but the video was her work for the perfume advertisement. Through his deception, Patrick achieved his goal of avenging the death of Mark, whom he loved.

Its purpose is to promote high standards of veterinary nursing in New Zealand.  History  The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association was established in 1992 by a group of like minded veterinary nurses, seeking representation within the veterinary profession in New Zealand. As of October 2018 the membership of the association stands at just over 1160 members. Veterinary nursing in New Zealand is a profession in its own right, moving away from the previous classification of paraprofessionals.  Purpose  The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association functions as the representative body for veterinary nurses in New Zealand. It provides an annual Continuing Professional Development scheme, linked closely with the newly implemented voluntary registration. The association produces a quarterly journal (New Zealand Veterinary Nurse journal) and a regular e-newsletter to keep members up to date with current issues in the veterinary nursing profession. Executive committee members of the association provide support to its members on a wide range of topics, including Human Resources, Health and Safety, and Regulation. The organisation raises awareness about common issues, for example obesity, which affects one in three pets. The NZVNA set recommended wage guidelines for veterinary nurses and veterinary nursing assistants. The NZVNA oversees Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for veterinary nurses, and provides accreditation for CPD providers. = WSAVA affiliate = The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association was the first representative body for veterinary nurses to be an affiliate member of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association. = IVNTA affiliate = The New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association is a permanent member of the International Veterinary Nurses and Technicians Association (which advocates communication and co-operation of veterinary nurses and technicians around the world.  Regulation  In 2016, the New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association implemented voluntary registration of veterinary nurses. Previously, there was no form of registration, or formal way of recognising veterinary nursing qualifications. Currently, registration is overseen by the New Zealand Veterinary Nursing Association, with plans to establish a Veterinary Nursing Council of New Zealand to take over this process in the future. The process of regulation of veterinary nurses coincides with the New Zealand government's review of veterinary nursing education. Veterinary nursing education underwent a mandated government review in 2014/2015, with new qualifications being delivered in 2016. These are the Certificate in Veterinary Technology, Veterinary Nursing Assistant, and Diploma in Veterinary Nursing. The Diploma in Veterinary Nursing is the minimum qualification required for registration.  Vet Nurse of the Year award winners  The NZVNA and Hill's Veterinary Nurse of the Year Award was launched in 2013 to recognise New Zealand veterinary nurses who advocate and significantly contribute to the care of their patients, and who are an integral part of the veterinary health care team.

Education Eelco Alta was born in 1723 in the coastal village of Makkum, and studied theology at the University of Franeker from 1737 until 1745, when he started as a minister in the nearby villages of Beers and Jellum. After nine years he moved to the main protestant church of Boazum, where he was to spend almost all of the next fifty years. He was politically active in the last years of the Dutch Republic, siding (although not explicitly) with the forces of republican \\"Patriotism\\", partly for religious reasons. During the royalist backlash of the late 1780s, this caused him some problems: some of his sons were actively persecuted, while he was forced to leave Boazum between 1790 and the Batavian Revolution of 1795. Thereafter, he shortly served as a member of the newly installed parliament of the Batavian Republic, but afterward admitted to prefer spending his time with his congregation.Nieuw Nederlands Biografisch Woordenboek (NNBW), Vol. 4, p. 38-9.

In 1780, the Society for the Avancement of Agriculture in Amsterdam (Maatschappij ter bevordering van den Landbouw) awarded him 30 golden guineas for his efforts in promoting vaccination against Rinderpest, about which he submitted an extensive treaty to the society. Astronomy Initially anonymously, Alta authored a treatise in 1774, Philosophical Considerations concerning the Conjunction of the Planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon.

It was long said to have motivated Eise Eisinga to build his famous planetarium (or orrery) in Franeker. According to the canonicised view, Alta stated that the upcoming conjunction of the planets with the sun would herald the apocalypse, and through his planetarium, Eisinga was able to prove that in fact, the conjunction would not take place. Modern research has however come to the more prosaic conclusion that Eisinga was mainly motivated by practical motives - most of all not having to calculate the orbits and respective positions of the planets and the sun on paper, but instead using his planetarium as a reference.Huib J.

Amarendran). His gym trainer Dheena (Sai Dheena) is seen paying respects at the funeral before leaving. The plot then shifts to a young crime inspector named Kumaran (Sundeep Kishan), who is chasing a petty thief and witnesses Dheena murdering his wife. Kumaran chases Dheena, who corners him and halts him with a blow to his head. In an ensuing tussle, Kumaran manages to kill Dheena. A meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai (Lavanya Tripathi) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later, when he faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai, who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress, Vishma (Akshara Gowda) is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and gets stressed and shocked upon finding the similar blood stains from the earlier murder and the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer. Aadhirai finds him, treats him for his PTSD, and makes him normal. Kumaran meets with Rudhran (Daniel Balaji) and introduces Aadhirai to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds that a makeup man named Gopi (Mime Gopi) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, he gets to know that Gopi and Dheena showed a totally different behavior a few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down Gopi, but he jumps to his death before confessing anything. The next murder happens, and the victim is another scientist named Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find evidences in Narayanan's home and finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits his office and finds that his behavior has changed. His own dog starts to bark at him, and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening, and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold-blooded side when he kills his dog. Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody. While signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name but corrects it to his own sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that the first sign was signed \\"Pramodh\\". A brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a late colleague of Narayanan. They worked together at the Indian Institute of Neurosciences. A senior official named Velayudham (Jayaprakash) reveals that Pramodh was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store their memories into a hard drive, which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a gel which would house millions of nano-transmitters. When injected into the brain, these transmitters will attach onto the neurons. When the person dies, their memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased, and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano- transmitters. This way the person (their memories) will not die and will instead live forever. To prove his theory, Pramodh works day and night. During this experiment, he sends a patient into a coma but is not bothered about human life and instead wants to succeed in his mission. After Narayanan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neurosciences, he stops Pramodh's project. Pramodh uses himself as the subject, transfers his memories in a hard drive, and commits suicide. Once he dies, his memories get transferred to his trainer, and then to Gopi and then Rudhran. Kumaran solves this and finds that the next target is Army general Major Sathyan (Jackie Shroff). Pramodh, who is living in Rudhran's body, commits suicide and arrives into Sathyan's brain. Sathyan invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years, and no one can stop him. With a clue from Pramodh's wife, Kumaran finds his secret lab where Pramodh has his memories stored. Pramodh successfully retrieves the hard drive containing his memories, which includes blackmailing and later killing Kumaran's friend Karna (Bagavathi Perumal). He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down, and a gunfight ensues. Finally, Kumaran realizes that Aadhirai is the next subject. If Sathyan dies, then Pramodh's memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice. 20 years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai, and they have a son. It is shown that Kumaran has trapped Sathyan in his basement and has kept him alive.

It has smooth, powdery white bark, a crown of juvenile, sessile, stem-clasping leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus mooreana is a straggly tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of and often has a crooked trunk. It has smooth white, powdery bark that is shed annually to reveal pale pink new bark, and small branches that are glaucous. The leave in the crown are juvenile leaves that are sessile, stem-clasping, elliptical to heart-shaped or almost round, sometimes lance-shaped, long and wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves are the same shade of dull greyish green to glaucous on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds usually sessile. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and wide and red or maroon with a glaucous covering and a conical operculum. Flowering occurs between May and August and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Eucalyptus mooreana is similar in appearance to, and closely related to the kalumburu gum (E. herbertiana) and Halls Creek white gum (E. cupularis) but can be distinguished from them by its crown of stem-clasping, juvenile leaves. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus mooreana was formally described by William Vincent Fitzgerald and the description was published in \\"The Western Mail\\" newspaper on 2 June 1906. The specific epithet (mooreana) honours Newton James Moore who was Minister of Lands at the time. Further descriptions of the species as E. mooreana (W.V.Fitzg.) Maiden were published in 1920 by Joseph Maiden in his book A Critical Revision of the genus Eucalyptus but the Australian Plant Census accepts Fitzgerald's original 1906 publication. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus mooreana is found on steep rocky slopes and summits in a small area of the Kimberley region of Western Australia where it grows in red sandy soils over sandstone or quartzite in the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It is isolated to six separate populations, five of which are in conservation areas and one on a pastoral lease spread over a combined area of . One of the populations comprised 150 individual plants while the others have not been surveyed. It is found at reasonable high elevations including the summit of Mount Broome at , Bold Bluff and Mount Leake . Conservation status In 2008 the species is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Federal GovernmentEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) meaning that it is likely to become extinct or is rare, or otherwise in need of special protection. The main threats to the species are fire and grazing by cattle.

Unlike an order of removal (including expedited removal as well as orders obtained as a result of removal proceedings), a withdrawal of application for admission does not create a bar to future entry.  Types of withdrawal  = For people who are not Lawful Permanent Residents = For people who are not United States Lawful Permanent Residents, withdrawal of application for admission is officially noted on Form I-275, Withdrawal of Application for Admission/Consular Notification. The Form I-275 has two pages. The first page includes the alien's biographical information and the reasons why the application would have been denied. The second page includes a signed statement by the alien acknowledging that he or she has read the reasons the application would be denied, and is choosing to withdraw the application. Additional forms that may be attached to Form I-275 include Form I-213 (Record of Apprehension or Interview) and Form I-862 (Notice to Appear). = For Lawful Permanent Residents = For Lawful Permanent Residents seeking re-entry, the LPR may be denied re-entry due to living outside the United States for over a year, or due to criminal activity that makes him or her inadmissible. In the case of LPRs who are being denied re-entry solely on account of living outside the United States for long but do not otherwise have any blemish on their immigration record, withdrawal of application for admission is usually offered as an option, both by CBP and by the Immigration Judge. The withdrawal of application for admission is entered on Form I-407, along with a Voluntary Relinquishing of Permanent Residence.  Stages at which withdrawal may be sought  Withdrawal of application may be sought at any of these stages: * Initial inspection at a designated port of entry, from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This is the most common use of withdrawal of application for admission. * Deferred inspection at a Deferred Inspection Site, from CBP. * An Immigration Judge (IJ) while in removal proceedings. = Withdrawal of application for admission at the designated port of entry = Arriving Aliens undergo initial inspection at a designated port of entry (such as an airport, seaport, or land port; note that this does not include unofficial land crossings) by officers of the Office of Field Operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When an alien presents himself or herself for admission at a designated port of entry, the usual course of action is for a CBP officer to let the alien in. If the alien is entering on a nonimmigrant visa, a Form I-94 is issued, whereas if the alien is entering using the Visa Waiver Program, Form I-94W is issued. Lawful Permanent Residents are not issued any form upon re-entry. If the CBP officer believes that the alien should not be admitted, the alien may be taken in for extended questioning, after which the alien may either be allowed to enter the United States, or face one of these fates: * Withdrawal of application for admission/consular notification: Here, the applicant withdraws the application to enter the United States. If the entry was visa-based, the corresponding visa may or may not be canceled, depending on the specifics. * Expedited removal * Removal proceedings that involve a hearing before an Immigration Judge (this is quite rare for arriving aliens, since any arriving alien deemed removable can be removed through expedited removal). At land borders, voluntary departure and voluntary return may also be available options. The option of withdrawal of application for admission is offered by CBP at the discretion of the officers involved. The following factors are considered when making the decision, as per the instructions in Section 17.2 of CBP's Inspector's Field Manual: * Seriousness of the immigration violation: The more serious the violation, the less likely it is that CBP allows a withdrawal of application for admission. * Previous findings of inadmissibility against the applicant: Past findings of inadmissibility make it unlikely that a withdrawal of application for admission be granted. * Intent of the person to violate the law: Persons who are suspected of having intent to violate the law are unlikely to be allowed to withdraw their application than those who appear to have made an honest mistake. * Ability to overcome the ground of inadmissibility: If it is believed that the alien would be admissible to the United States with somewhat different documentation (such as a different kind of visa, or a waiver), CBP is more likely to allow the alien to withdraw the application for admission. * Age or poor health of applicant: Aliens in poor health are more likely to be allowed to withdraw their application for admission. * Other humanitarian or public interest considerations: Such considerations, where applicable, may lead CBP to be more willing to allow a withdrawal of application for admission than it otherwise would. In summary, withdrawal of application for admission is suitable for cases where an alien may have innocently or through ignorance, misinformation, or bad advice, obtained an inappropriate visa but has not concealed the true purpose of the trip. For instance, an alien who entered on a visa whose expiration date is not yet reached, but that is no longer valid because the underlying status is now void, may be asked to withdraw the application for admission. For lawful permanent residents, the option to withdraw the application for admission may be offered in cases where the LPR appears to be inadmissible on account of having been outside the United States for a long period of time. In the case of a withdrawal of application for admission at a designated port of entry, the applicant must depart immediately. Generally, the alien stays in the custody of either CBP or the air or sea carrier throughout the process. In addition to issuing Form I-275 or I-407 indicating withdrawal of application for admission, the CBP also issues: * Form I-259 to the alien's air or sea carrier (in the case of aliens entering at air or sea ports) telling the carrier to return the alien by a specified date. * Form I-94, endorsing both sections with \\"WD - Application for Admission WIthdrawn. (Stamp Number), (Port), and (Date).\\" In addition, Block 20 indicates the file number of the alien's case, Block 26 specifies the grounds of inadmissibility, the withdrawal form served, and the flight or ship by which the alien is expected to depart. = Withdrawal of application at a deferred inspection site = Deferred inspection means that the officer at the port of entry, rather than making a final decision on whether to admit the applicant, defers the decision, asking the applicant to show up for an interview at a CBP office with additional documentation and for a final decision, as described in Section 17.1 of the CBP's Inspector's Field Manual. The onward office where the deferred inspection is carried out uses the same criteria for determining whether to allow the applicant to withdraw the application for admission as the CBP officers at the port of entry do. = Withdrawal of application for admission with the consent of an immigration judge = It is sometimes possible for the Immigration Judge (IJ) to allow the alien to withdraw the application for admission during removal proceedings. Note that this applies only to Arriving Aliens, who were never admitted into the United States, but rather were stopped by CBP at the time of attempted entry and placed in removal proceedings. Usually, the consent of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is necessary in order for the applicant to be allowed to withdraw the application at this stage. The IJ cannot grant permission to withdraw until he or she is satisfied: # that the individual possesses both the means and intent to depart immediately; and # that the individual has established that factors directly relating to the issue of inadmissibility indicate that granting withdrawal would be in the interest of justice.  Consequences  = Entry in the alien's immigration record = The Form I-275 (and for people entering as LPRs, Form I-407) becomes part of the alien's immigration record, potentially affecting future attempts to be admitted to the United States or apply for visas. = Effect on validity of documents used for seeking admission = A withdrawal of application for admission does not automatically invalidate the documents used (if any) to seek admission. In cases of application for admission using an entry visa, the visa remains intact where the reason for inadmissibility does not extend to invalidating the visa. An example would be if the alien simply forgot to bring along all the necessary documentation while traveling but has it at home. On the other hand, if the reason for inadmissibility also implies that the visa should not be issued, the visa is invalidated and the applicant needs to apply for a visa again with the consulate. Regardless of whether the visa is invalidated, the withdrawal of application for admission does not directly invalidate any underlying USCIS application or petition (such as Form I-129 or Form I-130), or other form (such as Form I-20 for students) that was a prerequisite to obtaining the visa.  History  = Prior to the IIRIRA = Prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, withdrawal of application for admission was not recognized in any statute or regulation. The rules surrounding it were only articulated in Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decisions. Some important decisions were: * Matter of Vargas-Molina (1971) recognized that an Immigration Judge (IJ) could discretionarily allow an alien to withdraw the application for admission during removal proceedings. However, in order for this to happen, the alien needed to convince the IJ that it was in the best interests of justice. * Matter of Gutierrez (1988) clarified that the alien needed to demonstrate to the IJ that he or she would immediately depart the United States in order to be able to withdraw the application. It also clarified that withdrawal of application for admission should not be construed as a form of relief from removal. Further, if excludability (now called inadmissibility) were established, the approval of the INS (now the U.S. Department of Homeland Security) was needed to allow withdrawal. = Withdrawal of application for admission as recognized in the IIRIRA = The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 officially recognized withdrawal of application for admission. It stated that withdrawal of application for admission was a discretionary option that the Attorney General could offer at any time in lieu of either expedited removal or removal proceedings. = Use of this procedure after Donald Trump's executive orders on January 27, 2017 = On January 27, 2017, United States President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13769, immediately forbidding the entry into the United States of people from seven countries on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Some people from these countries, who had obtained visas prior to the order and were en route to the United States at the time of the order, were inadmissible into the United States, but not through any fault of their own. The CBP Office of Field Operations officers at the ports of entry offered some of these people the option to withdraw their application for admission.  Comparison with other procedures  = Comparison with removal procedures = Withdrawal of application for admission is an alternative to expedited removal (when carried out by CBP) or removal proceedings (when carried out by the Immigration Judge). Whereas withdrawal of application for admission requires the consent of both the authorities (CBP or the Immigration Judge) and the alien, expedited removal does not require the alien's consent. An alien who refuses to withdraw the application for admission may instead be subject to expedited removal (by the CBP) or removal through an order by the Immigration Judge. Other ways an alien may receive an order of removal include stipulated removal (requires the consent of the alien and the Immigration Judge), reinstatement of removal (only applicable to somebody who re-enters unlawfully after having previously being removed), and removal proceedings (order given by the Immigration Judge). An alien who receives an order of removal is subject to a re-entry bar that may be five, ten, or twenty years depending on the circumstances. In contrast, there are no re-entry bars in case of withdrawal of application for admission. The main disadvantage of a withdrawal of application for admission is that it constitutes consent on the alien's part to the charges made in the Form I-275, and therefore makes it harder for the alien to challenge or appeal the finding. Expedited removal orders can be challenged with the CBP (though not appealed) and the findings of removal proceedings allow for appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals. = Comparison with voluntary return = Another option that is somewhat similar to withdrawal of application for admission is voluntary return. The two are similar in the following respects: * In both cases, the alien does not formally enter the United States. * Neither of them involves a removal order, and therefore neither carries the re-entry bar (5, 10 or 20 years) associated with a removal order. * Both of them are offered discretionarily by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, usually the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer at the port of entry or deferred inspection site. * Both of them require consent from the alien as well, though if the alien fails to consent, he or she may be subject to expedited removal instead, which carries more severe penalties. However, the two differ somewhat in the context where they are offered: * Withdrawal of application for admission applies only to Arriving Aliens who present themselves for admission at a port of entry, whereas voluntary return applies to people apprehended or stopped at a land border. In particular, the offices within CBP that handle these are different: withdrawal of application for admission is handled by the CBP Office of Field Operations whereas voluntary returns are handled by United States Border Patrol. * Withdrawal of application for admission is typically granted only in cases where the CBP officer involved genuinely believes that the alien did not engage in misrepresentation or try to break the law or conceal information, but voluntary return may be granted even in cases where it is believed that the applicant may have been trying to violate immigration law. * Withdrawal of application for admission is carried out through the issuing of immigration forms (I-275, etc.) whereas voluntary return requires no signed statement and in general involves less formality. = Comparison with voluntary departure = Like withdrawal of application for admission and voluntary return, voluntary departure requires the alien to leave the United States, but does not put a removal order on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a removal order would create. However, voluntary departure differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of unlawful presence acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes voluntary departure.

Formation and activities The Muwafaq Foundation was started by Khalid bin Mahfouz in Saudi Arabia in 1991 to ‚Äúestablish an endowment like the Rockefeller Foundation to give grants for disaster relief, education, and health‚Äù. The organization operated schools and health clinics in various countries ranging from Pakistan to Bosnia and Somalia. The organization was directed by Khalid bin Mahfouz's son, Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz, and Yasin al- Qadi, another prominent Saudi businessman who has also been linked to terrorist funding and was listed as a Specially Designated National by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Khalid bin Mahfouz owned National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest bank. In a lawsuit filed by families of 9/11 victims, the bank was said to have been involved in financing a number of bin Laden's terrorist attacks.Unger, Craig. (2004).

The Muwafaq Foundation is part of the Islamic Charity Project International umbrella organization which oversees over a dozen Islamic charities including Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini Society.Deliso, Christopher. (2007). The Coming Balkan Caliphate: The Threat of Radical Islam to Europe and the West. Praeger Security International. Pg. 32. The organization has been called ‚Äúan al Qaeda front that transfers millions from wealthy Saudis to bin Laden‚Äù by the U.S. Treasury Department. The bin Mafouz family has denied that the Muwafaq Foundation was involved in funding terrorism. Chronology The initial registration of the organization was done by al-Qadi, as well as its later registration as a financial trust in 1992. In May 1992, the organization described itself as having a new structure that was based in Jersey but focused on Pakistan, with offices in Islamabad and Peshawar. The island of Jersey is a tax haven and does not require charities to register and submit records so there are no public records documenting the foundation there. While not much is known about the actual activities of the organization, it is known to have operated internationally in several countries. The Muwafaq began activity in the Sudan in 1992 and began to benefit from funds collected by the Sudan government through a zakat, the Islamic charity tax on all citizens. In Sudan, the Muwaqaf partnered at least once with UNICEF who contributed $7,000 to develop a feeding center for malnourished children. Muwaqaf remained in Sudan as late as 1997 when it was described in a UN report as carrying out projects in health, education, and agriculture. Documents in 1993 show that the Muwaqaf was located in Somalia, but its headquarters were recorded as being in Delaware, which has the most relaxed corporate disclosure requirements in the United States. The headquarters in Delaware was shut down in 1995. The Muwafaq was also linked to mujahedeen operations in the Balkans and Europe, with offices registered in Croatia, Albania, Bosnia, Austria, and Germany. The foundation was also present in Ethiopia, which in the early 1990s led to allegations of their supporting terrorist activity in Africa. The newsletter Africa Confidential published a connection between the Muwafaq Foundation and an assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. It was believed that the Sudanese government and Islamist organizations were behind the assassination attempt. In 1995, the foundation filed a libel suit against the newsletter which it later won. The claims of the connection between the Muwafaq and the assassination attempt turned out to be false. In 1995, Ramzi Yousef was arrested for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York which caused Pakistani authorities to raid the Islamabad offices of both Muwaqaf and another charity, Mercy International. Amir Mehdi was the local head of Muwaqaf at the time and was held in prison for several months before he was eventually released without charge. In 1996, Paris based Arab newspaper Al-Watan al-Arabi published an interview with bin Laden. In the interview bin Laden named Muwaqaf in Zagreb, Croatia as a part of a humanitarian organization network of which he was a major supporter. In 1997, the bad publicity from the Africa Confidential article caused the Saudi government to end their operations, but its infrastructure, its legal system, and some of its schools and clinics were not ever formally dismantled. According to Yasin al-Qadi, the foundation closed in 1996. In 1998 the Muwaqaf became the subject of an FBI investigation after a man linked to Muwaqaf was named as a terrorist supporter.

The Annunciation icon is an example of the late Komnenian-era style and was likely produced in Constantinople. The icon, tempera on wood, is one of the largest icons on display at St. Catherine's Monastery, standing 61 cm in height and 42.2 cm length. Very similar Annunciation icons exist to help establish the date of the Sinai icon. One at Kurbinovo in Yugoslavia, dated 1191, and the icon at Lagoudhere on Cyprus, dated 1192.Weitzmann, Kurt, The Icon, Holy Images-Sixth to Fourteenth Century, (New York) George Braziller, Inc. 1978), 92. The icon has distinctive elements that lead art historians, such as Evans and Wixom, to suggest the icon may have been produced at St. Catherine's Monastery itself rather than Constantinople. The Annunciation icon shares features found exclusively on other icons only at the Sinai monastery, such as the reflective circles scored in the surface of the gold and the grisaille medallion with the infant Christ on the Virgin Mary's breast.  Iconography  The Annunciation icon is highly stylized and is striking for its unique emotional and dramatic quality. An exceptionally sophisticated piece, the icon is notable for its saturated golden tone and naturalism. Colors are used sparingly; deeply saturated blues and purples adorn the Virgin's garments and are used on the tips of the Angel Gabriel's wings as well.Weitzmann, Kurt, The icon, 92 The remainder of the icon is finished in gold grisaille. Rotating discs enhance the glittering effect of the icon. The Holy Spirit and Word of God, symbolized as the dove surrounded by the shimmering gold medallion, is shown descending upon the Virgin Mary. Gabriel's pose imitates the classical Maenad in form and style, and may be the Byzantine artist's allusion to Thucydides or Homer.Evans and Wixom, The Glory of Byzantium, Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era A.D.843-1261, New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Abrams, Inc. 1997. 374-375. Gabriel approaches the Virgin with a fluid running step. Gabriel is attired in flowing gold robes, done in striation that invigorates the angel's garment. The Angel Gabriel's expression has been described as intensely troubled as he looks into the sad face of the Virgin, anticipating her sorrows.Weitzmann, Kurt, The Icon, Holy Images, Sixth-Fourteenth Century,( New York, George Braziller, Inc,, 1978. 92-93 Depicting the Virgin Mary in a landscape setting, with the river at her feet, is exceptional in Byzantine art. The Virgin, sitting regally upon her throne, holds in her left hand the red fabric of the temple veil. The infant Christ is barely visible, traced by a gold mandorla or nimbus, upon the Virgin's upper body. Mary touches the baby in utero, with the same hand holding the red material, linking the Veil of the Temple to Christ. These iconographic details emphasize the theological rhetoric of the icon. The Virgin appears slender and frail, looking somewhat apprehensive at the approaching angel. The Byzantine artist has embellished the Annunciation Icon with motifs of spring and fertility.Belting, Hand, Likeness and Presence, A History of the Image before the Era of Art, (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 1994) 277. The river teems with various aquatic creatures. Spring motifs depict birds nesting on the rooftops, trees sprouting foliage, the flowing river freed from winter, underneath the golden glowing sun. Symbolism of fertility is reflected by the pair of storks on the rooftop and the river alive with fish, visual reminders that Christ's conception was at springtime. The spring date of the Feast of the Annunciation encouraged writers and artists to connect the feast's theme with natural symbolic representations of renewal.Belting, Hans, Likeness and Presence, A History of the Image before the Era of Art, 277-278 Beyond the river, gradations of gold background blend into the golden architectural buildings on the icon. The lower buildings in the foreground are thought to represent Nazareth, the hometown of the Virgin Mary.Belting, Hans, Likeness and Presence, A History of the Image before the Era of Art (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 1994) 277-278 The Virgin's golden house is an elegant church style structure. The marriage veil displayed in the window is drawn back.Evans and Wixom, The Glory of Byzantium, 374 Atop the Virgin's house is a rooftop garden alluding to the rhetoric of the Song of Solomon (4:12) and is associated with Mary's virginity.Evans and Wixom, The Glory of Byzantium, 375 The Virgin's house reflects fertility symbolized by the two storks nesting atop the roof.

The Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (AMFPA) is a worldwide organization representing these artists. The brushes and tools that are used are ordinary artist's implements, but they may be modified in length or width. Mouth painters hold the brush in their mouth or between their teeth and maneuver it with their tongue and cheek muscles. The paper or canvas is usually mounted vertically on an easel. Mouth painting is strenuous for neck and jaw muscles since the head has to perform the same back and forth movement as a hand does when painting.

She served as President of the History of Science Society (HSS) from 2006-2007. She has written extensively on gender and sexuality in medieval science and medicine. Her book Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture (1993) received the Pfizer Prize in 1994, from the History of Science Society, as the outstanding book on the history of science. Early life and education Joan Cadden received her B.A. from Vassar College in 1965, and her M.A. degree from Columbia University in 1967, writing her thesis on De elementis: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire in the 12th and 13th Centuries. She completed her Ph.D. in history and philosophy of science at Indiana University in 1971. Her Ph.D. thesis was The Medieval Philosophy and Biology of Growth: Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Albert of Saxony and Marsilius of Inghen on Book I, Chapter V of Aristotle‚Äôs ‚ÄòDe generatione et corruptione,‚Äô with Translated Texts of Albertus and Thomas Aquinas. Career Cadden taught as an assistant professor in the Department of History of Science at Harvard University from 1971-1976. She was a visiting lecturer in history at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1977-1978. She taught at Kenyon College from 1978-1996. She was a Dibner Visiting Historian of Science at Purdue University Calumet in 1996-1997. She joined the University of California at Davis in 1996 as Professor of History. Cadden served as President of the History of Science Society (HSS) from 2006-2007. She retired and became Professor Emeritus at UC Davis in 2008. Her work has been characterized as exploring the \\"seams of disciplines\\"‚Äîthe connections between history of science, gender history, history of sexuality, social history, and intellectual history. Methodologically, she broke new ground, paying \\"particular attention to the cultural and social milieux these sources were produced in; to the assumptions and expectations of authors and readers; to questions of form, style, and presentation.\\" Her book Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture (1993) was groundbreaking in its examination of sex and gender, and has deeply influenced subsequent scholarship. Cadden examines the discussions of sexual difference from Aristotle through the fourteenth century, revealing a wide range of ideas about sexual determination, reproductive roles and sexual pleasure. She finds multiple models of sexuality in writings throughout the middles ages. This challenged Thomas Laqueur's assertion in Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud (1990) that male and female were seen as \\"manifestations of a unified substratum\\" before the 18th century. Cadden addressed medieval discourse in all its \\"staggering complexity\\", an \\"interconnectedness of intellectual interests\\" that was \\"far from comforting\\" in its diversity. She went on to research Pietro D'Abano and to explore the complexities of medieval natural philosophers' understanding of homosexual desire in her book Nothing Natural Is Shameful: Sodomy and Science in Late Medieval Europe (2013). Although she recognizes its limitations, she uses the medieval term \\"sodomy\\" to avoid conflation with modern senses of the term \\"homosexuality\\". Discussion focuses around Aristotle's Problemata IV.26 and its questioning of male-male sexual desire. The book has been described as \\"a sophisticated reflection on sex and sexuality.\\" Awards Her book Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Age: Medicine, Science, and Culture (1993) received the 1994 Pfizer Prize for outstanding book on the history of science from the History of Science Society. It was the first book on gender studies and the first book in thirty years on medieval studies, to win that award. Her work was celebrated at two sessions at the 44th annual International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2009 by the Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship. The Medieval Foremothers Society honored Joan Cadden in the sessions ‚ÄúThinking beyond the ‚ÄòWoman Writer‚Äô in Reconstructing Women‚Äôs Intellectual Worlds,‚Äù and ‚Äú(New) Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages: Medicine, Science, and Culture (A Roundtable).‚Äù These were later published in the Medieval Feminist Forum (2010).

It is where the English serial killer John George Haigh, the \\"Acid Bath Murderer\\", met his first victim. History The Goat is the oldest remaining pub on Kensington High Street, being constructed in 1695. The area had become a regular east-west route when King William built Kensington Palace and The Goat was the first significant building on this new thoroughfare. It was built as a coffeehouse but, by 1702, it was an alehouse. In 1707, the freehold was purchased by the local parish for ¬£80, using funds from the legacies of two women who had left money for education and support of the poor. The income from the alehouse was then used to support the poor and the National School which had been established in Kensington in 1645. There were extensive alterations in 1880. Around 1896, a new pub sign was painted by the Beggarstaffs who had their studio in Kensington at the time. This endured into the twentieth century and impressed the local art aficiando, Oliver Brown. =John George Haigh, the \\"Acid Bath Murderer\\"= In 1944, the English serial killer John George Haigh, the \\"Acid Bath Murderer\\", had a chance meeting in the Goat with William McSwann, a wealthy owner of amusement arcades, for whom he had worked as a chauffeur in 1936, before spending time in prison for fraud. They met at the Goat again at about 6pm on 9 September, when they had some glasses of wine and a meal, after which Haigh enticed McSwann to his workshop nearby at 79 Gloucester Road (now the basement of a branch of Kentucky Fried Chicken), broke his skull with a pinball table leg, and dumped his body in a 40-gallon tub which he filled with sulphuric acid. Haigh went on to kill McSwann's parents almost a year later, and dissolved their corpses in sulphuric acid elsewhere, before assuming McSwann's identity and selling all of his parents' properties. =Secret tunnels to Kensington Palace= There are many rumours of tunnels linking the pub to Kensington Palace, which it overlooks, and although there are extensive vaults under the road, and perhaps tunnels into the grounds, no tunnel to the Palace itself has yet been found.

Cao Pi, the first emperor of the Wei, ordered its compilation upon his accession to the throne in 220 and it was completed in 222. The purpose of the Huanglan was to provide the emperor and ministers of state with conveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time. Complete versions of the Huanglan existed until the Song dynasty (960-1279), when it became a lost work, although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies. The Huanglan was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the (624) Tang Yiwen Leiju and the (1408) Ming Yongle dadian. Title The title combines hu√°ng Áöá \\"emperor; imperial\\" and l«én Ë¶Ω \\"see; look at; watch; inspect; display\\" (compare the Taiping Yulan encyclopedia). This character Ë¶Ω redundantly combines ji√†n Ë¶ã \\"‚Äòsee\\" and the phonetic element jiƒÅn Áõ£ < Old Chinese *kÀÅram \\"see; look at; inspect\\", which was an ancient graphic variant character for ji√†n < *kÀÅram-s Èëë or Èëí \\"mirror\\", cognate with j√¨ng Èè° *qra≈ã-s \\"mirror\\". Five centuries before the title Huanglan first occurred, but the words huang (before it meant \\"emperor\\") and lan co-occur in the Chuci poem Li Sao \\"Encountering Sorrow\\", believed to be written by Qu Yuan (c. 340-278 BCE). The 1st line establishes the poet's noble ancestry from Zhuanxu, the legendary Yellow Emperor's grandson, the 2nd describes his auspicious birth, and the 3rd line says, \\"My father, seeing the aspect of my nativity (ÁöáË¶ΩÊèÜ‰ΩôÂàùÂ∫¶ÂÖÆ), Took omens to give me an auspicious name\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 68). In this context, huang Áöá means \\"august; stately; revered\\" in reference to the poet's father and lan Ë¶Ω means \\"see\\". The \\"mirror\\" meaning of the Chinese lan in Huanglan parallels the Medieval genre of speculum literature that aimed to encompass encyclopedic knowledge in a single work (e.g., Albertus Magnus's Speculum astronomiae), and the modern scholarly survey article that summarizes a field of knowledge. Although the title is usually transliterated Huanglan or Huang Lan, some English translations are: *Imperial Speculum (Needham et al. 1986: 569) *The Imperial Survey (Yong and Peng 2008: 225) *Book for the Emperors (Cheng, Brown, et al. 2009 5: 2667) *Emperor's mirror (Zurndorfer 2013: 505) *Imperial Anthology (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2015) History A painting of Cao Pi and two ministers, by the Tang dynasty artist Yan Liben. Beginning with the 3rd- century Huanglan, the first Chinese \\"encyclopedia\\" genre was the \\"imperial florilegium\\" that compiled excerpts from other writings and arranged them under appropriate headings for the convenience of the emperor and his ministers (Needham et al. 1986: 200). Chinese traditional leishu encyclopedias differ from Western encyclopedias in that they consist almost entirely of selected quotations from written sources and arranged by a set of categories, the name encyclopedia having been applied to them because they embrace the whole realm of knowledge (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 81). The emperor summoned a group of Confucian scholars to compile a completely new type of reference work that would provide the emperor and his ministers with a quick source for finding moral and political precedents (Zurndorfer 2013: 505). The chief editor Mou Xi ÁπÜË•≤ (186-245) collaborated with Liu Shao, Huan Fan, Wang Xiang ÁéãË±°, Wei Dan ÈüãË™ï, and other scholars (Needham et al. 1986: 569, Theobald 2013). Cao Pi instructed his officials to collect all the available classical philosophical texts and their commentaries, and to arrange them in suilei xiangcong Èö®È°ûÁõ∏Âæû \\"successive categories\\" (Zurndorfer 2013: 509). The Huanglan compilers adopted the macrostructure of the (c. 3rd century BCE) Erya dictionary with explicitly labelled sections, the microstructure of the (c. 239 BCE) L√ºshi Chunqiu (Yong and Peng 2008: 225). The original Huanglan was divided into over 40 sections and comprised over 1000 chapters. During the Six dynasties period (222-589), a number of works like the Huanglan were compiled, including the (c. 530) Liang dynasty Hualin bianlue ËèØÊûóÈÅçÁï• \\"An Arrangement of the Whole Company of Flowers\\" by Xu Mian ÂæêÂãâ and (c. 550) Northern Qi Xiuwendian yulan ‰øÆÊñáÊÆøÂæ°Ë¶Ω \\"Imperial Speculum of the Hall of the Cultivation of Literature\\" (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 207, 571). Both of these were lost. Between the 3rd and 18th centuries, some 600 leishu were compiled, of which only 200 are still extant (Zurndorfer 2013: 505). The textual history of the Huanglan is recorded in the bibliography sections of the standard Twenty-Four Histories. The (636) Book of Sui bibliography Á∂ìÁ±çÂøó section records Huanglan ÁöáË¶Ω editions in a 120-chapter version edited by Moui Xi ÁπÜË•≤ and others, a Liang dynasty 680-chapter version, a 123-chapter version by the astronomer He Chengtian ‰ΩïÊâøÂ§©, and a 50-chapter version by Xu Yuan ÂæêÁà∞. It also records the lost 4-chapter Huanglanmu ÁöáË¶ΩÁõÆ index, and the 12-chapter Huanglan chao ÁöáË¶ΩÊäÑ revised by Prince Xiao Chen Ëï≠Áêõ. The (945) Old Book of Tang bibliography Á∂ìÁ±ç‰∏ã records a 122-chapter version by He Chengtian, and an 84-chapter one by Xu Yuan. Subsequent standard histories do not record the Huanglan. By the year 1000, the complete version Huanglan was definitively known to be lost (Drege 1991: 24). Several Qing dynasty (1644-1911) scholars collected surviving fragments of the lost encyclopedia (e.g., the Commentary on the Water Classic quotes it 15 times). For example, Huang Shi ÈªÉÂ•≠'s Wei Huanglan È≠èÁöáË¶Ω and Wang Mo's Huanglan yili ÁöáË¶ΩÈÄ∏Á¶Æ. References *Cheng, Linsun, Kerry Brown, et al., eds.

It has trails connecting it to Santa Rosa Valley County Park at the canyon's mouth, to Wildwood Regional Park east of the canyon, and to Rancho Conejo Playfields southwest of the canyon. Geography The canyon separates the Conejo Grade area and westernmost Simi Hills from the Mount Clef Ridge to the east. It was formed by Arroyo Conejo (creek) flowing down through the Simis from the higher Conejo Valley to the lower Santa Rosa Valley, where the creek merges with Arroyo Santa Rosa and becomes Conejo Creek. It is located in an area locally known as La Barranca (Spanish for canyon). It is a deeply eroded canyon at the foothills of dramatic ridgelines and volcanic outcroppings on the Mount Clef Ridge. Hill Canyon is part of the Conejo Canyons Open Space, which is owned and operated by the Conejo Open Space Foundation (COSF). The canyon is situated east of the Conejo Grade in Camarillo, CA, and is immediately west of the Mount Clef Ridge of Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks. Once slated for a golf course , the canyon is now protected open space.

Here, the final decision on whether to admit the Arriving Alien, instead of being conducted at the port of entry where the alien arrived, is deferred to be carried out later at a deferred inspection site, while the alien is paroled into the United States. The guidelines followed at the deferred inspection site are largely the same as those followed by the officers at the port of entry, and are described in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Inspector's Field Manual. Aliens do not accrue unlawful presence between the time of arrival and the date of deferred inspection, but they do begin to accrue unlawful presence after their parole ends, if they are not successfully admitted at the deferred inspection site by then. The officers at both the port of entry and the deferred inspection site are part of the CBP Office of Field Operations.  Decision at the port of entry to use deferred inspection  = Conditions under which the officer at the port of entry may choose deferred inspection = Deferred inspection is used in cases where the officer at the port of entry (such as an airport or a sea port) has doubts about the arriving alien's admissibility to the United States, and believes these doubts cannot be satisfactorily resolved at the port of entry but can be resolved through one or more of these: * Presentation of additional evidence * Further review of the case * The posting of a maintenance of status and departure bond * Other similar action that can only be conducted at the onward location Deferred inspection should not be used merely with the goal of transferring a difficult case to another office, but rather should be accompanied by clear reasons for deferral. Moreover, the option is generally intended for use only in cases where it is believed that the case is likely to be resolved in the alien's favor, and not in cases where the alien is likely to be established inadmissible. The officer at the port of entry should consider the following when making a decision to defer inspection: * The likelihood that the alien will be able to establish admissibility: Only if this is high will inspection be deferred. * The type of documents lacking, and the ability to obtain necessary documentation: Only if it is deemed likely that the alien can obtain the documents will the inspection be deferred. * The alien's good faith efforts to obtain necessary documents prior to arrival at the POE: If the alien did not make good faith efforts, deferred inspection is less likely to be granted. * The verification or establishment of the alien's identity and nationality * Age, health, and family ties * Other humanitarian considerations * The likelihood that the alien will appear * The nature of possible inadmissibility (i.e., criminal history, previous violations) * The potential danger posed to society if the alien is paroled: The more dangerous he alien is deemed, the less likely deferred inspection is. Common reasons for deferred inspection include situations where a Lawful Permanent Resident is believed to have been outside the United States for over 180 days, or cases where the alien is believed to have committed a crime that makes the alien inadmissible or removable. = Procedure at the port of entry = The following procedures are followed for deferred inspection: * The deferral of inspection must be approved by the port director, assistant port director, or chief inspector at the GS-13 level or above. * If approved, the alien is issued a Form I-546, Order to Appear for Deferred Inspection. The form includes the name of the deferred inspection site where the alien must appear. The deferred inspection site where the alien is asked to appear is called the onward office. * Information about the deferred inspection, including a copy of the Form I-546, is added to the alien's information on record with the CBP, and forwarded to the onward office within 24 hours of the scheduling of the deferred inspection. * The alien is photographed and fingerprinted using Form FD-249. * The alien is paroled for a period of at most 30 days, and the Form I-94 is stamped with a parole stamp and endorsed to indicate the following:  Date to which deferred/paroled  DE, Deferred Inspection (with purpose)  Deferring port code  Action date  The officer's admission stamp code  Onward office code * In addition, a Form I-259, Notice to Detain, Remove, or Present Alien, is issued to the alien's air or sea carrier, telling the carrier that it is possible that the alien may need to be returned (either as a result of an expedited removal order or because the alien is asked to withdraw his or her application for admission at the deferred inspection site).  Processing before and at the onward office  = Preparation for the deferred inspection = The alien needs to work to acquire all the relevant documentation that needs to be presented to demonstrate admissibility, to show at the onward office. On CBP's side, the port of entry forwards the alien's file, including a copy of the Form I-546, to the onward office. The onward office may need to do additional processing to evaluate te alien's admissibility. = Conduct of the deferred inspection = When the alien appears for the deferred inspection at the onward office, the officer here inspects the alien using the same rules that the officer at the port of entry would, but now armed with the additional documentation available. There are two possibilities: * The alien is found admissible: The alien's parole period ends and the alien is now considered officially admitted to the United States. If the alien is not a Lawful Permanent Resident and is entering in a non-immigrant status, then a new Form I-94 is issued. * The alien is found inadmissible: The officer may discretionarily allow the alien to withdraw the application for admission, to which the alien may or may not consent. The officer may also issue an order of expedited removal against the alien, or put the alien through removal proceedings. In the case of a withdrawal of application for admission or order of expedited removal, the original Form I-259 issued at the port of entry can be used to compel the alien's carrier to return the alien. The CBP officer conducting the deferred inspection at the onward office may allow the applicant's attorney to be present. However, the attorney's role is limited to that of observer and consultant for the applicant, and the attorney does not have legal authority to represent the applicant. = Dealing with no shows = It is the onward office's responsibility to monitor the progress of cases referred for a deferred inspection. Cases should not be pending longer than 30 days after the expiration of the scheduled appointment unless the applicant requested an extension. If the alien fails to appear for his or her deferred inspection, then the alien starts accruing unlawful presence and receives a Form I-862 Notice to Appear, indicating the beginning of removal proceedings against the alien. At this point, regardless of the issue of the alien's original admissibility, the alien's subsequent unlawful presence can hurt his or her immigration record.  Other actions  = Corrections to Form I-94 = Deferred inspection sites also be used by aliens seeking to fix problems with the documents issued to them at the port of entry (specifically, the Form I-94). For instance, if an alien entered lawfully but was not issued a Form I-94, or was issued a Form I-94 with incorrect information. In addition, if some information was not entered correctly on the Form I-94, this can be fixed at a deferred inspection site. = Changes to the expiration date on Form I-94 are not handled at deferred inspection site = Deferred inspection sites are only intended for correcting errors at the port of entry, rather than extending the expiration date of a correctly filled Form I-94. To extend the validity of Form I-94, the extension needs to be made with the appropriate government agency. In particular: * In general, the standard methods to extend or change non-immigrant status, such as Form I-129 (when extending or switching to a temporary work status), Form I-539 (for other statuses), and Form I-485 (for Adjustment of Status to a Lawful Permanent Resident) apply. * For people on student and exchange visitor visas (F visa and J visa), if the Form I-94 has expiration date specified as \\"D/S\\" (Duration of Status) it suffices to extend the underlying authorization by extending the expiration date on the Form I-20. This is done with the assistance of the student's Designated School Official (DSO). * For people on student and exchange visitor visas, there could be cases where the Form I-94's expiration date is 30 days from the date of arrival, instead of \\"D/S\\". This happens when there are some problems with the alien's documentation. The alien is issued Form I-515A explaining the problem, and must coordinate with the DSO to send this documentation, along with Form I-20 or Form DS-2019, Form I-94, admission stamp, and the SEVIS fee, to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Although qualitatively similar to deferred inspection, this differs in that the alien is officially admitted rather than paroled, and the next step is carried out with the SEVP rather than with the CBP. If the Form I-94 does not have \\"D/S\\" but the applicant did not receive a Form I-515A, this is an error on CBP's part and should be resolved at a Deferred Inspection site.

In 1991, Kadi loaned $820,000 to the Quranic Literacy Institute allegedly due to his friendship with the group‚Äôs president. While he said that the money was intended to allow them to make a land investment in order to yield profits and support their work, the income was actually given to Mohammad Salah, a high level Hamas military operative who was employed as a computer analyst by the Quranic Literacy Institute. When Mohammad Salah pleaded guilty to helping Hamas in an Israeli military court in 1995, the U.S. Treasury Department added him as a list of specially designated terrorists. In 1998 when he returned to the Chicago suburbs, the U.S. filed a forfeiture complaint to confiscate $1.4 million in assets that belonged to him and the Quranic Literacy Institute. The $820,000 loaned to the Institute by Kadi was included in the confiscated funds. The organization was also used to transfer funds by Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzook, who was working to resurrect the military wing of Hamas. The organization served as a transfer point of funds between Hamas political committee leaders to those tasked with revitalizing the Hamas military wing. This occurred after the mass deportation of Hamas and other terrorists from Gaza and the West Bank to southern Lebanon in 1992. In 2004, the Quranic Literacy Institute was ruled liable, along with the Holy Land Foundation, and Islamic Association of Palestine, in a $156 million lawsuit for aiding and abetting Hamas in the death of 17-year-old U.S. citizen, David Boim. The decision was later reversed on the grounds that it could not be proven that the funds given by these organizations to Hamas were intended for use in the death of David Boim and nothing else. Further trials occurred against the Holy Land Foundation; its 2008 trial was the largest terrorism financing prosecution in American history.

Waywords and Meansigns has released two editions of audio, each offering an unabridged musical adaptation of Joyce's book. A third edition, featuring over 100 artists and performing much shorter passages of the book, debuted May 4, 2017. The project brought together a diverse array of musicians. An artist or group performed each chapter in the first two editions; artists performed shorter, page-length passages in the third edition. The musicians only requirements were that \\"the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order\\". With a goal of making Joyce's famously obscure novel more accessible, all audio from the project is distributed freely online. Background The Waywords and Meansigns project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged. The first edition, which premiered in 2015, featured a different artist or musical group performing each of the book's seventeen chapters. The second edition, which premiered in 2016, also offered an unabridged version of the book, performed by a different set of artists and musicians. A third edition, dubbed the Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition, premiered in 2017 with a focus on performing shorter passages rather than complete chapters. In an open edition, with contributors invited to create new recordings on an ongoing basis, the Opendoor Edition features over 100 contributors from 15 countries. Over 300 people have been involved in Waywords and Meansigns since 2014. While some passages in Waywords and Meansigns adhere to traditional song structures, much of the music is experimental. The musicians' only requirements were that \\"the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order.\\" All audio from the project is distributed freely online under Creative Commons licensing. Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at Royal Holloway, University of London has called the project \\"wonderfully innovative\\" and The Guardian has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible. Contributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of \\"musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake- heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous.\\" Waywords and Meansigns has been noted as a uniquely ambitious, and unusual, project. Rock critic Jesse Jarnow applauded Waywords and Meansigns for their innovative use of the digital platform and University College Dublin's Digital Platform for Contemporary Irish Writing includes Waywords and Meansigns in their \\"Joyce Today\\" collection.

Reception While many reviews of Waywords and Meansigns celebrate the project for its uniqueness and ambition, other reviewers find the project's massive scope daunting. The project has been lauded for its digital distribution platform, utilizing Creative Commons licensing to freely distribute audio. Writing for The Guardian, Billy Mills described Waywords and Meansigns as one of many Internet-based projects helping to make Joyce's famously obscure novel more approachable. While premiering advance audio from the second edition, Bort of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote \\"this massive undertaking will provide an endless supply of head scratches and cheers alike to its undertakers\\". While reviewing Neil Campbell's contribution in The Wire, Dan Barrow spoke positively of the overall project: \\"As a putative adaptation of the Wake, does the approach of Waywords and Meansigns work? Undoubtedly.\\" The James Joyce Centre dubbed the first edition \\"31 hours, 8 minutes, 11 seconds worth of delightful strangeness.\\" James Joyce scholar Finn Fordham called the project \\"wonderfully innovative\\" and described the second edition as \\"a series of unexpected transformations of this endlessly transformative text.\\" The open information site and public domain blog Open Culture featured all three editions of the project, writing of the first edition \\"as with all compilation albums, some tracks are better than others... It is definitely a labor of love.\\" Open Culture wrote of the second edition: \\"these artists try to transcend ordinary ways of reading great literature, and clearly have lots fun in the doing\\". Aodh√°n Kelly and Tom De Keyser reviewed the first edition of Waywords and Meansigns for the James Joyce Quarterly. Noting that \\"the project has gathered considerable interest among both the artistic community and Joyce enthusiasts and reading groups\\", Kelly and De Keyser wrote that \\"each track is... a unique and completely personal interpretation of an artist's reading of the text\\". The review concludes: \\"While we cannot say that we enjoyed the music in all instances, the project does attempt to bring challenging literature to a broader public... add[ing] another layer of richness to the life of the book with its own musical interpretation as a new form of cultural production\\". Paste's Jay Horton wrote of the third edition: \\"It‚Äôs soon enough made clear that there are as many varieties of musical renderings as there are interpretations of its prose, which sparks the likely-unavoidable problem concerning the songs and the book they‚Äôre taken from and the ideas it (barely) contains ‚Äì there‚Äôs just too damn many.\\" In her PopMatters review, Maria Schurr wrote of the third edition: \\"the well of inspiration springing from Joyce's words is thrillingly infinite.\\" Open Culture's Josh Jones deemed the third edition \\"one of the most appropriate responses to the novel in the 78 years since its publication.\\" See also *James Joyce *Finnegans Wake *Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition References External links *Waywords and Meansigns website Category:Creative Commons-licensed works Category:Digital humanities projects Category:Finnegans Wake Category:Macaronic language Category:Music organizations ","title":"Waywords and Meansigns"},{"id":"49476874","text":"Roger Federer was the two-time defending champion, but withdrew due to a knee injury.

Biography Baybugha was a mamluk of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad. According to historian David Ayalon, Baybugha was one of the few mamluks to have ethnic Rus origins. He is first mentioned by Mamluk-era historians during the reign of an-Nasir Muhammad's son, as-Salih Isma'il. During the reign of the latter's brother and successor, al-Muzaffar Hajji, Baybugha became the amir majlis (lord of the audience), a relatively high-ranking office which was responsible for overseeing the sultan's physicians and oculists. In 1347, he was promoted to na'ib al-saltana (viceroy) of Egypt. During the reign of Hajji's successor, an-Nasir Hasan, another son of an-Nasir Muhammad, Baybugha, as na'ib al- saltana, was among the four senior emirs who actually ruled the Mamluk state.Al-Harithy 1996, p. 70. The other three were Baybugha's brother Manjak al-Yusufi (com), Shaykhu an-Nasiri and Taz an-Nasiri (com), all former mamluks of an-Nasir Muhammad. During his viceroyship, in 1348, Baybugha decreed that the sons of fief holders could inherit the fiefs from their fathers. The decree endeared him to the population. While on Baybugha was making the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca with Taz, an-Nasir Hasan attempted to assert his authority over the senior emirs, and had Baybugha arrested. He was imprisoned in al- Karak. An-Nasir Hasan was overthrown in September 1351 and replaced by his half-brother as-Salih Salih. The latter freed Baybugha and appointed him na'ib (governor) of Aleppo in 1351, replacing Emir Arghun al-Kamili.Al-Harithy 1996, p. 78. The following year, Baybugha incited a rebellion by the Mamluk emirs in Syria against the sultan. The latter responded by leading a military expedition against the rebellious emirs, and he succeeded in arresting Baybugha, along with the nuwab (governors) of Safad, Hama and Tripoli. Baybugha was incarcerated in the Aleppo Citadel in 1353, and was executed later that year. He was married to Shaqra (d. 1389), a daughter of An-Nasir Hasan.

As of December 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 800 vulnerable avian species. 7.3% of all evaluated avian species are listed as vulnerable. No subpopulations of birds have been evaluated by the IUCN. For a species to be assessed as vulnerable to extinction the best available evidence must meet quantitative criteria set by the IUCN designed to reflect \\"a high risk of extinction in the wild\\". Endangered and critically endangered species also meet the quantitative criteria of vulnerable species, and are listed separately. See: List of endangered birds, List of critically endangered birds. Vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species are collectively referred to as threatened species by the IUCN. Additionally 53 avian species (0.48% of those evaluated) are listed as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status. As these species typically have small distributions and/or populations, they are intrinsically likely to be threatened, according to the IUCN. While the category of data deficient indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa, the IUCN notes that it may be appropriate to give them \\"the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed.\\" This is a complete list of vulnerable avian species evaluated by the IUCN.

Through community involvement, students, faculty, and community members joined forces to push for the restoration of a public building known for its policy of racial discrimination against African Americans as a center for the study of civil rights. Housed in the former Engman Public Natatorium ‚Äì South Bend, Indiana's first swimming pool that excluded and then segregated against African Americans for almost thirty years ‚Äì the CRHC is dedicated to the preservation of the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the history of race and ethnic relations in the Michiana area, and seeks to provide education, research, and forums, while examining human rights principles and challenges for future generations. Located within the West Washington National Historic Register District, the Engman Natatorium opened in 1922 as a public swimming pool that limited use to whites and was not fully integrated until 1950. The Natatorium closed in 1978, and sat for decades in a state of disrepair. Thanks to the efforts of students, and faculty from Indiana University South Bend, the City of South Bend, the South Bend Heritage Foundation, and the Indiana University Foundation, the building underwent extensive renovations and now functions as the home of the Civil Rights Heritage Center. History The Indiana University South Bend Civil Rights Heritage Center was born out of the transformation of the former Engman Public Natatorium. This unique rebirth of the public pool, which was honored in South Bend's designation as an All-America City in 2011 and a 2014 Freedom Award presented at the Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Indiana Statehouse Celebration, now pays tribute to the civil-rights contributions of local citizens. On May 14, 2000, sixteen IU South Bend students, faculty, and staff from the South Bend Tribune boarded a tour bus for 15 days of studying the Civil Rights Movement in the South. Their goal was to experience history as a living presence, to feel its power and vitality in a way which goes far beyond even the best books and classroom lectures. These students walked where civil rights participants walked, ate where they ate, and talked with more than twenty veterans of this critical period in our nation's history. These students returned from Freedom Summer 2000 and founded the Civil Rights Heritage Center. The Civil Rights Heritage Center was formed to record, preserve, and highlight the struggles and achievements of citizens committed to social justice. In May 2010, the Engman Natatorium was dedicated as the IU South Bend Civil Rights Heritage Center with support from generous contributions from local residents and philanthropists and the College of Liberal Arts and Science at IU South Bend. It represents a legacy of determination and triumph and stands as a symbol of justice won, in a community committed to healing its past.
