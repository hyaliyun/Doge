This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional malnutrition, starvation, epidemic, and increased mortality. Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine. The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 2000s. Some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, continue to have extreme cases of famine. Since 2010, Africa has been the most affected continent in the world. As of 2017, the United Nations has warned over 20 million are at risk in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen. The distribution of food has been affected by conflict. Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa. Definitions According to the United Nations humanitarian criteria, even if there are food shortages with large numbers of people lacking nutrition, a famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. The criteria are:https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/07/382342-when-food-security-crisis- becomes-famine * At least 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope * The prevalence of acute malnutrition in children exceeds 30% * The death rate exceeds two people per 10,000 people per day The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem. History Global famines history The cyclical occurrence of famine has been a mainstay of societies engaged in subsistence agriculture since the dawn of agriculture itself. The frequency and intensity of famine has fluctuated throughout history, depending on changes in food demand, such as population growth, and supply-side shifts caused by changing climatic conditions. Famine was first eliminated in Holland and England during the 17th century, due to the commercialization of agriculture and the implementation of improved techniques to increase crop yields. =Decline of famine= In the 16th and 17th century, the feudal system began to break down, and more prosperous farmers began to enclose their own land and improve their yields to sell the surplus crops for a profit. These capitalist landowners paid their labourers with money, thereby increasing the commercialization of rural society. In the emerging competitive labour market, better techniques for the improvement of labour productivity were increasingly valued and rewarded. It was in the farmer's interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed surpluses of their crop every year if they could. Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing taxes. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced industrial crops, but they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations. Peasants also used the new money to purchase manufactured goods. The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the 16th century, but took off in the early 17th century. By the 1590s, these trends were sufficiently developed in the rich and commercialized province of Holland to allow its population to withstand a general outbreak of famine in Western Europe at that time. By that time, the Netherlands had one of the most commercialized agricultural systems in Europe. They grew many industrial crops such as flax, hemp and hops. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply. By 1650, English agriculture had also become commercialized on a much wider scale. The last peacetime famine in England was in 1623‚Äì24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were enclosed for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization. By the end of the 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe. In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of Europe, however. In Eastern Europe, famines occurred as late as the twentieth century. =Attempts at famine alleviation= Skibbereen, Ireland, during the Great Famine, 1847 illustration by James Mahony for the Illustrated London News Because of the severity of famine, it was a chief concern for governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, although they were severely limited in their options due to limited levels of external trade and an infrastructure and bureaucracy generally too rudimentary to effect real relief. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to revolt and other forms of social disruption. By the mid-19th century and the onset of the Industrial Revolution, it became possible for governments to alleviate the effects of famine through price controls, large scale importation of food products from foreign markets, stockpiling, rationing, regulation of production and charity. The Great Famine of 1845 in Ireland was one of the first famines to feature such intervention, although the government response was often lacklustre. The initial response of the British government to the early phase of the famine was \\"prompt and relatively successful\\", according to F. S. L. Lyons. Confronted by widespread crop failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel purchased ¬£100,000 worth of maize and cornmeal secretly from America. Baring Brothers & Co initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government hoped that they would not \\"stifle private enterprise\\" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846. The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound. In 1846, Peel moved to repeal the Corn Laws, tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry. In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland. People waiting for famine relief in Bangalore, India (from the Illustrated London News, 1877) Despite this promising start, the measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Lord John Russell, proved comparatively \\"inadequate\\" as the crisis deepened. Russell's ministry introduced public works projects, which by December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to administer. The government was influenced by a laissez-faire belief that the market would provide the food needed. It halted government food and relief works, and turned to a mixture of \\"indoor\\" and \\"outdoor\\" direct relief; the former administered in workhouses through the Poor Law, the latter through soup kitchens. A systematic attempt at creating the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with famine was developed by the British Raj in the 1880s. In order to comprehensively address the issue of famine, the British created an Indian Famine commission to recommend steps that the government would be required to take in the event of a famine. The Famine Commission issued a series of government guidelines and regulations on how to respond to famines and food shortages called the Famine Code. The famine code was also one of the first attempts to scientifically predict famine in order to mitigate its effects. These were finally passed into law in 1883 under Lord Ripon. The Code introduced the first famine scale: three levels of food insecurity were defined: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine. \\"Scarcity\\" was defined as three successive years of crop failure, crop yields of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress. \\"Famine\\" further included a rise in food prices above 140% of \\"normal\\", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality. The Commission identified that the loss of wages from lack of employment of agricultural labourers and artisans were the cause of famines. The Famine Code applied a strategy of generating employment for these sections of the population and relied on open-ended public works to do so.

Depicted from left to right are Death, Famine, War, and Conquest. =20th century= During the 20th century, an estimated 70 to 100 million people died from famines across the world, of whom over half died in China, with an estimated 30 million dying during the famine of 1958‚Äì1961, up to 10 million in the Chinese famine of 1928‚Äì1930, and over two million in the Chinese famine of 1942‚Äì43, and millions more lost in famines in North and East China. The USSR lost 8 million claimed by the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33, over a million in both the Soviet famine of 1946‚Äì47 and Siege of Leningrad, the 5 million in the Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22, and others famines. Approximately 3 million died as a consequence of the Second Congo War, and Java suffered 2.5 million deaths under Japanese occupation. The other most notable famine of the century was the man-made Bengal famine of 1943, resulting more from the Japanese occupation of Burma, resulting in an influx of refugees, and blocking Burmese grain imports, a failure of the Bengali provincial Government to declare a famine, and fund relief, the imposition of grain and transport embargoes by the neighbouring provincial administrations, to prevent their own stocks being transferred to Bengal, the failure to implement India wide rationing by the central Delhi authority, hoarding and profiteering by merchants, medieval land management practices, an Axis powers denial program that confiscated boats once used to transport grain, programs of civil disobedience and sabotage to force an end of the British Raj, a Delhi administration that prioritised supplying, and offering medical treatment to the British Indian Army, War workers, and Civil servants, over the populous at large, incompetence and ignorance, and an Imperial War Cabinet initially leaving the issue to the Colonial administration to resolve, than to the original local crop failures, and blights. A few of the great famines of the late 20th century were: the Biafran famine in the 1960s, the Khmer Rouge- caused famine in Cambodia in the 1970s, the North Korean famine of the 1990s, and the Ethiopian famine of 1983‚Äì1985. The latter event was reported on television reports around the world, carrying footage of starving Ethiopians whose plight was centered around a feeding station near the town of Korem. This stimulated the first mass movements to end famine across the world. BBC newsreader Michael Buerk gave moving commentary of the tragedy on 23 October 1984, which he described as a \\"biblical famine\\". This prompted the Band Aid single, which was organized by Bob Geldof and featured more than 20 pop stars. The Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia raised even more funds for the cause. Hundreds of thousands of people died within one year as a result of the famine, but the publicity Live Aid generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa. Some of the famines of the 20th century served the geopolitical purposes of governments, including traumatizing and replacing distrusted ethnic populations in strategically important regions, rendering regions vulnerable to invasion difficult to govern by an enemy power and shifting the burden of food shortage onto regions where the distress of the population posed a lesser risk of catastrophic regime de-legitimation. 21st century Percentage of population suffering from hunger, World Food Programme, 2013 Until 2017, worldwide deaths from famine had been falling dramatically. The World Peace Foundation reported that from the 1870s to the 1970s, great famines killed an average of 928,000 people a year. Since 1980, annual deaths had dropped to an average of 75,000, less than 10% of what they had been until the 1970s. That reduction was achieved despite the approximately 150,000 lives lost in the 2011 Somalia famine. Yet in 2017, the UN officially declared famine had returned to Africa, with about 20 million people at risk of death from starvation in Nigeria, in South Sudan, in Yemen, and in Somalia. Regional history =Africa= Early history In the mid-22nd century BC, a sudden and short-lived climatic change that caused reduced rainfall resulted in several decades of drought in Upper Egypt. The resulting famine and civil strife is believed to have been a major cause of the collapse of the Old Kingdom. An account from the First Intermediate Period states, \\"All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger and people were eating their children.\\" In 1680s, famine extended across the entire Sahel, and in 1738 half the population of Timbuktu died of famine. In Egypt, between 1687 and 1731, there were six famines. The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one- sixth of its population.

According to John Iliffe, \\"Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys.\\"John Iliffe (2007). Africans: the history of a continent. Cambridge University Press. p. 68. The first documentation of weather in West-Central Africa occurs around the mid-16th to 17th centuries in areas such as Luanda Kongo, however, not much data was recorded on the issues of weather and disease except for a few notable documents. The only records obtained are of violence between Portuguese and Africans during the Battle of Mbilwa in 1665. In these documents the Portuguese wrote of African raids on Portuguese merchants solely for food, giving clear signs of famine. Additionally, instances of cannibalism by the African Jaga were also more prevalent during this time frame, indicating an extreme deprivation of a primary food source. Colonial period Punch cartoon depicting King Leopold II as a snake entangling a Congolese man A notable period of famine occurred around the turn of the 20th century in the Congo Free State. In forming this state, Leopold used mass labor camps to finance his empire. This period resulted in the death of up to 10 million Congolese from brutality, disease and famine. Some colonial \\"pacification\\" efforts often caused severe famine, notably with the repression of the Maji Maji revolt in Tanganyika in 1906. The introduction of cash crops such as cotton, and forcible measures to impel farmers to grow these crops, sometimes impoverished the peasantry in many areas, such as northern Nigeria, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine when severe drought struck in 1913. A large-scale famine occurred in Ethiopia in 1888 and succeeding years, as the rinderpest epizootic, introduced into Eritrea by infected cattle, spread southwards reaching ultimately as far as South Africa. In Ethiopia it was estimated that as much as 90 percent of the national herd died, rendering rich farmers and herders destitute overnight. This coincided with drought associated with an el Nino oscillation, human epidemics of smallpox, and in several countries, intense war. The Ethiopian Great famine that afflicted Ethiopia from 1888 to 1892 cost it roughly one-third of its population.http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html In Sudan the year 1888 is remembered as the worst famine in history, on account of these factors and also the exactions imposed by the Mahdist state. Records compiled for the Himba recall two droughts from 1910 to 1917. They were recorded by the Himba through a method of oral tradition. From 1910 to 1911 the Himba described the drought as \\"drought of the omutati seed\\", also called omangowi, which means the fruit of an unidentified vine that people ate during the time period. From 1914 to 1916 droughts brought katur' ombanda or kari' ombanda which means \\"the time of eating clothing\\". 20th century Malnourished children in Niger, during the 2005 famine For the middle part of the 20th century, agriculturalists, economists and geographers did not consider Africa to be especially famine prone. From 1870 to 2010, 87% of deaths from famine occurred in Asia and Eastern Europe, with only 9.2% in Africa. There were notable counter-examples, such as the famine in Rwanda during World War II and the Malawi famine of 1949, but most famines were localized and brief food shortages. Although the drought was brief the main cause of death in Rwanda was due to Belgian prerogatives to acquisition grain from their colony (Rwanda). The increased grain acquisition was related to WW2. This and the drought caused 300,000 Rwandans to perish. From 1967 to 1969 large scale famine occurred in Biafra and Nigeria due to a government blockade of the Breakaway territory. It is estimated that 1.5 million people died of starvation due to this famine. Additionally, drought and other government interference with the food supply caused 500 thousand Africans to perish in Central and West Africa. Famine recurred in the early 1970s, when Ethiopia and the west African Sahel suffered drought and famine. The Ethiopian famine of that time was closely linked to the crisis of feudalism in that country, and in due course helped to bring about the downfall of the Emperor Haile Selassie. The Sahelian famine was associated with the slowly growing crisis of pastoralism in Africa, which has seen livestock herding decline as a viable way of life over the last two generations. A girl during the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide. Famines occurred in Sudan in the late-1970s and again in 1990 and 1998. The 1980 famine in Karamoja, Uganda was, in terms of mortality rates, one of the worst in history. 21% of the population died, including 60% of the infants. In the 1980s, large scale multilayer drought occurred in the Sudan and Sahelian regions of Africa. This caused famine because even though the Sudanese Government believed there was a surplus of grain, there were local deficits across the region. In October 1984, television reports describing the Ethiopian famine as \\"biblical\\", prompted the Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia, which raised large sums to alleviate the suffering. A primary cause of the famine (one of the largest seen in the country) is that Ethiopia (and the surrounding Horn) was still recovering from the droughts which occurred in the mid-late 1970s. Compounding this problem was the intermittent fighting due to civil war, the government's lack of organization in providing relief, and hoarding of supplies to control the population. Ultimately, over 1 million Ethiopians died and over 22 million people suffered due to the prolonged drought, which lasted roughly 2 years. In 1992 Somalia became a war zone with no effective government, police, or basic services after the collapse of the dictatorship led by Siad Barre and the split of power between warlords. This coincided with a massive drought, causing over 300,000 Somalis to perish. Recent years Laure Souley holds her three-year-old daughter and an infant son at a MSF aide center during the 2005 famine, Maradi Niger Since the start of the 21st century, more effective early warning and humanitarian response actions have reduced the number of deaths by famine markedly. That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from cash crops to import food. Agriculture in Africa is susceptible to climatic fluctuations, especially droughts which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include soil infertility, land degradation and erosion, swarms of desert locusts, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases. Desertification is increasingly problematic: the Sahara reportedly spreads up to per year. The most serious famines have been caused by a combination of drought, misguided economic policies, and conflict. The 1983‚Äì85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government's censorship of the emerging crisis. In Capitalist Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then- government of President Gaafar Nimeiry, to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people‚Äîand helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry. Numerous factors make the food security situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and civil war, corruption and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the 1998 Sudan famine. AIDS is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households. On the other hand, in the modern history of Africa on quite a few occasions famines acted as a major source of acute political instability.See, for example, Andrey Korotayev and Daria Khaltourina Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa. Moscow: 2006. In Africa, if current trends of population growth and soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to United Nations University (UNU)'s Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa. Famine-affected areas in the western Sahel belt during the 2012 drought. Recent famines in Africa include the 2005‚Äì06 Niger food crisis, the 2010 Sahel famine and the 2011 East Africa drought, where two consecutive missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst drought in East Africa in 60 years. An estimated 50,000 to 150,000 people are reported to have died during the period.\\"Fatal Failure: Did Aid Agencies Let Up To 100,000 Somalis Die in 2011?\\". Time. 18 January 2012. In 2012, the Sahel drought put more than 10 million people in the western Sahel at risk of famine (according to a Methodist Relief & Development Fund (MRDF) aid expert), due to a month-long heat wave. Today, famine is most widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of groundwater, wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering. These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment. The famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls. Modern African famines are characterized by widespread destitution and malnutrition, with heightened mortality confined to young children. Current initiatives Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. One pan-African example is the Great Green Wall. Another example is the \\"Community Area-Based Development Approach\\" to agricultural development (\\"CABDA\\"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in Ethiopia in the 1990s it has spread to Malawi, Uganda, Eritrea and Kenya. In an analysis of the programme by the Overseas Development Institute, CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region. =The role of African Unity organization= The organization of African unity and its role in the African crisis has been interested in the political aspects of the continent, especially the liberation of the occupied parts of it and the elimination of racism. The organization has succeeded in this area but the economic field and development has not succeeded in these fields. African leaders have agreed to waive the role of their organization in the development to the United Nations through the Economic Commission for Africa \\"ECA\\".Al-Kout, Bashir. (1987) \\"African Unity in the 20 century\\" :Cairo =Far East= Chinese officials engaged in famine relief, 19th-century engraving Chinese scholars had kept count of 1,828 instances of famine from 108 BC to 1911 in one province or another‚Äîan average of close to one famine per year. From 1333 to 1337 a terrible famine killed 6 million Chinese. The four famines of 1810, 1811, 1846, and 1849 are said to have killed no fewer than 45 million people. Japan experienced more than 130 famines between 1603 and 1868. The period from 1850 to 1873 saw, as a result of the Taiping Rebellion, drought, and famine, the population of China drop by over 30 million people. China's Qing Dynasty bureaucracy, which devoted extensive attention to minimizing famines, is credited with averting a series of famines following El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation-linked droughts and floods. These events are comparable, though somewhat smaller in scale, to the ecological trigger events of China's vast 19th-century famines.Pierre-Etienne Will, Bureaucracy and Famine Qing China carried out its relief efforts, which included vast shipments of food, a requirement that the rich open their storehouses to the poor, and price regulation, as part of a state guarantee of subsistence to the peasantry (known as ming-sheng). When a stressed monarchy shifted from state management and direct shipments of grain to monetary charity in the mid-19th century, the system broke down. Thus the 1867‚Äì68 famine under the Tongzhi Restoration was successfully relieved but the Great North China Famine of 1877‚Äì78, caused by drought across northern China, was a catastrophe. The province of Shanxi was substantially depopulated as grains ran out, and desperately starving people stripped forests, fields, and their very houses for food. Estimated mortality is 9.5 to 13 million people.Dimensions of need ‚Äì People and populations at risk. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Great Leap Forward The largest famine of the 20th century, and almost certainly of all time, was the 1958‚Äì1961 famine associated with the Great Leap Forward in China. The immediate causes of this famine lay in Mao Zedong's ill-fated attempt to transform China from an agricultural nation to an industrial power in one huge leap. Communist Party cadres across China insisted that peasants abandon their farms for collective farms, and begin to produce steel in small foundries, often melting down their farm instruments in the process. Collectivisation undermined incentives for the investment of labor and resources in agriculture; unrealistic plans for decentralized metal production sapped needed labor; unfavorable weather conditions; and communal dining halls encouraged overconsumption of available food. Such was the centralized control of information and the intense pressure on party cadres to report only good news‚Äîsuch as production quotas met or exceeded‚Äîthat information about the escalating disaster was effectively suppressed. When the leadership did become aware of the scale of the famine, it did little to respond, and continued to ban any discussion of the cataclysm. This blanket suppression of news was so effective that very few Chinese citizens were aware of the scale of the famine, and the greatest peacetime demographic disaster of the 20th century only became widely known twenty years later, when the veil of censorship began to lift. The exact number of famine deaths during 1958‚Äì1961 is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18 million to at least 42 millionDik√∂tter, Frank. Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958‚Äì62. Walker & Company, 2010. p. xii. . people, with a further 30 million cancelled or delayed births. It was only when the famine had wrought its worst that Mao reversed agricultural collectivisation policies, which were effectively dismantled in 1978. China has not experienced a famine of the proportions of the Great Leap Forward since 1961. Khmer Rouge Skulls of Khmer Rouge murder victims at Choeung Ek In 1975, the Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia. The new government was led by Pol Pot, who desired to turn Cambodia into a communist, agrarian utopia. His regime emptied the cities, abolished currency and private property, and forced Cambodia's population into slavery on communal farms. In less than four years, the Khmer Rouge had executed nearly 1.4 million people, mostly those believed to be a threat to the new ideology. Due to the failure of the Khmer Rouge's agrarian reform policies, Cambodia experienced widespread famine. As many as one million more died from starvation, disease, and exhaustion resulting from these policies.Shawcross, William, The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience, Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115‚Äì116.Kaplan, Robert D., The Ends of the Earth, Vintage, 1996, p. 406. In 1979 Vietnam invaded Cambodia and removed the Khmer Rouge from power. By that time about one quarter of Cambodia's population had been killed. North Korean famine in the 1990s Famine struck North Korea in the mid-1990s, set off by unprecedented floods. This autarkic urban, industrial state depended on massive inputs of subsidised goods, including fossil fuels, primarily from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. When the Soviet collapse and China's marketization switched trade to a hard currency, full-price basis, North Korea's economy collapsed. The vulnerable agricultural sector experienced a massive failure in 1995‚Äì96, expanding to full-fledged famine by 1996‚Äì1999. Estimates based on the North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008. North Korea has not yet regained food self-sufficiency and relies on external food aid from China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. While Woo-Cumings have focused on the FAD side of the famine, Moon argues that FAD shifted the incentive structure of the authoritarian regime to react in a way that forced millions of disenfranchised people to starve to death. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), North Korea is facing a serious cereal shortfall in 2017 after the country's crop harvest was diminished as a result of severe drought. The FAO estimated that early-season production fell by over 30 percent compared to agricultural output from the previous year, leading to the country's worst famine since 2001. Vietnam Japanese occupation during World War II caused the Vietnamese Famine of 1945, which caused around 700,000 to 2,000,000 deaths. =India= Owing to its almost entire dependence upon the monsoon rains, India is vulnerable to crop failures, which upon occasion deepen into famine. There were 14 famines in India between the 11th and 17th centuries (Bhatia, 1985). For example, during the 1022‚Äì1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in Deccan killed at least two million people in 1702‚Äì1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the British rule, that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as Tamil Nadu in the south, and Bihar and Bengal in the east during the latter half of the 19th century. Victims of the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 in India during British rule, pictured in 1877. Romesh Chunder Dutt argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as Amartya Sen agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in Afghanistan (see The Second Anglo-Afghan War), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.) Some British citizens, such as William Digby, agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but Lord Lytton, the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the Bengal famine of 1770, is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives‚Äîone-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable famines include the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people diedDavis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. p. 7 and the Indian famine of 1899‚Äì1900, in which 1.25 to 10 million people died.Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. p. 173 The famines were ended by the 20th century with the exception of the Bengal famine of 1943 killing an estimated 2.1 million Bengalis during World War II. The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including Burma, had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons. The Maharashtra drought saw zero deaths from starvation and is known for the successful employment of famine prevention policies, unlike during British rule. =Middle East= A starving woman and child during the Assyrian Genocide. Ottoman Empire, 1915 The Great Persian famine of 1870‚Äì1872 is believed to have caused the death of 1.5 million persons (20‚Äì25% of the population) in Persia (present-day Iran). In the early 20th century an Ottoman blockade of food being exported to Lebanon caused a famine which killed up to 450,000 Lebanese (about one-third of the population). The famine killed more people than the Lebanese Civil War. The blockade was caused by uprisings in the Syrian region of the Empire including one which occurred in the 1860s which lead to the massacre of thousands of Lebanese and Syrian by Ottoman Turks and local Druze.Christoffel Anthonie Olivier Nieuwenhuijze (1977). Commoners, Climbers and Notables: A Sampler of Studies on Social Ranking in the Middle East. Brill Archive ISBN. p. 213. =Europe= Middle Ages The Great Famine of 1315‚Äì1317 (or to 1322) was the first major food crisis to strike Europe in the 14th century. Millions in northern Europe died over an extended number of years, marking a clear end to the earlier period of growth and prosperity during the 11th and 12th centuries. An unusually cold and wet spring of 1315 led to widespread crop failures, which lasted until at least the summer of 1317; some regions in Europe did not fully recover until 1322. Most nobles, cities, and states were slow to respond to the crisis and when they realized its severity, they had little success in securing food for their people. In 1315, in Norfolk, England, the price of grain soared from 5 shillings/quarter to 20 shillings/quarter. It was a period marked by extreme levels of criminal activity, disease and mass death, infanticide, and cannibalism. It had consequences for Church, State, European society and future calamities to follow in the 14th century. There were 95 famines in medieval Britain, and 75 or more in medieval France. More than 10% of England's population, or at least 500,000 people, may have died during the famine of 1315‚Äì1316. Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of starvation led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long- term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their draught animals, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their seed corn, sacrificing next year's crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to banditry in order to acquire enough to eat. One famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of God's displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God's wrath in the form of famine. 16th century Goya's Disasters of War, showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck Madrid in 1811‚Äì1812. During the 15th century to the 18th century, famines in Europe became more frequent due to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate resulted in harvest failures and shortfalls that led to a rise in conspiracy theories concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the Pacte de Famine in France.Kaplan, Steven. The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture, they were still quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively. The great famine of the 1590s began a period of famine and decline in the 17th century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad-crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and, to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad-crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often, unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever-increasing numbers of urban poor. All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas. The Netherlands was able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. Amsterdam's grain trade with the Baltic guaranteed a food supply. 17th century The years around 1620 saw another period of famine sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in Finland in 1696, killed one-third of the population.http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh- ehp/nehapfin.pdf Devastating harvest failures afflicted the northern Italian economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not recover fully for centuries. There were serious famines in the late-1640s and less severe ones in the 1670s throughout northern Italy. Over two million people died in two famines in France between 1693 and 1710. Both famines were made worse by ongoing wars.

Rowland, \\"The Jesuits of Cagliari [in Sardinia] recorded years during the late 1500s 'of such hunger and so sterile that the majority of the people could sustain life only with wild ferns and other weeds' ... During the terrible famine of 1680, some 80,000 persons, out of a total population of 250,000, are said to have died, and entire villages were devastated\\".

The lava caused little direct damage, but ash and sulphur dioxide spewed out over most of the country, causing three-quarters of the island's livestock to perish. In the following famine, around ten thousand people died, one-fifth of the population of Iceland. [Asimov, 1984, 152‚Äì53] 19th century Depiction of victims of the Great Famine in Ireland, 1845‚Äì1849 Other areas of Europe have known famines much more recently. France saw famines as recently as the 19th century. The Great Famine in Ireland, 1846‚Äì1851, caused by the failure of the potato crop over a few years, resulted in 1,000,000 dead and another 2,000,000 refugees fleeing to Britain, Australia and the United States. 20th century Famine still occurred in Eastern Europe during the 20th century. Droughts and famines in Imperial Russia are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years, with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years. Russia experienced eleven major famines between 1845 and 1922, one of the worst being the famine of 1891‚Äì92.Alan Macfarlane. \\"The Dimension of Famine\\" (PDF). The Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 killed an estimated 5 million. Victims of the Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 during the Russian Civil War Famines continued in the Soviet era, the most notorious being the Holodomor in various parts of the country, especially the Volga, and the Ukrainian and northern Kazakh SSR's during the winter of 1932‚Äì1933. The Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 is nowadays reckoned to have cost an estimated 6 million lives.St√©phane Courtois, Mark Kramer. Livre noir du Communisme: crimes, terreur, r√©pression. Harvard University Press, 1999. p. 206. The last major famine in the USSR happened in 1947 due to the severe drought and the mismanagement of grain reserves by the Soviet government. The Hunger Plan, i.e. the Nazi plan to starve large sections of the Soviet population, caused the deaths of many. The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands, including Jews, totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR. This included 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. There were an additional estimated 3 million famine deaths in areas of the USSR not under German occupation.The Russian Academy of Science Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk. Liudskie poteri SSSR v period vtoroi mirovoi voiny: sbornik statei. Saint Petersburg 1995 The 872 days of the Siege of Leningrad (1941‚Äì1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people. Famine even struck in Western Europe during the Second World War. In the Netherlands, the of 1944 killed approximately 30,000 people. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time. =Latin America= Malnourished child during Brazil's 1877‚Äì78 Grande Seca (Great Drought).

An epidemic of stem rust, which is destructive to wheat and is caused by race Ug99, has in 2007 spread across Africa and into Asia. Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen fertilizers, new pesticides, desert farming, and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution influenced agriculture] world grain production increased by 250%. Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to soil contamination, salt accumulation due to irrigation, erosion).

In 1994, David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), estimated the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million.David Pimentel, Mario Giampietro 1994. Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy. Carrying Capacity Network, 1994. Book, online at http://www.dieoff.com/page55.htm with highlights at http://www.dieoff.com/page40.htm According to geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer, coming decades could see rising food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level. Water deficits, which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India. The water tables are falling in many countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overconsumption. Other countries affected include Pakistan, Iran, and Mexico. This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even while overexploiting its aquifers, China has developed a grain deficit, contributing to the upward pressure on grain prices. Most of the three billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits ‚Äì Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Pakistan. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains marginally self-sufficient. But with a population expanding by 4 million a year, it will also soon turn to the world market for grain. According to a UN climate report, the Himalayan glaciers that are the principal dry-season water sources of Asia's biggest rivers ‚Äì Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Yellow ‚Äì could disappear by 2350 as temperatures rise and human demand rises. Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers.http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 India, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by severe droughts in coming decades. In India alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people. Evan Fraser, a geographer at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, explores the ways in which climate change may affect future famines.Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495‚Äì514. To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future. Drawing on situations as diverse as the Great Famine of Ireland,Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9 (online). a series of weather induced famines in Asia during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three \\"lines of defense\\" that protect a community's food security from environmental change. The first line of defense is the agro-ecosystem on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in organic matter tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as drought have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather. The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society. Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an ecosystem is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather- related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense. Hence, understanding how climate change may cause famines in the future requires combining both an assessment of local socio-economic and environmental factors along with climate models that predict where bad weather may occur in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis \\"of biblical proportions\\", or \\"hunger pandemic\\". This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way. Causes besieged Leningrad suffering from dystrophia in 1941.http://www.history.com/this-day-in- history.do?id=7014&action;=tdihArticleCategory Definitions of famines are based on three different categories‚Äîthese include food supply-based, food consumption-based and mortality-based definitions. Some definitions of famines are: * Blix ‚Äì Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates. * Brown and Eckholm ‚Äì Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger. * Scrimshaw ‚Äì Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people. * Ravallion ‚Äì Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population. * Cuny ‚Äì A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition. Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability. However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines. Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the \\"failure of exchange entitlements\\" or FEE. A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements. An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated. According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global climate change is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine. Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, population growth, an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government. According to a FEWSNET report, \\"Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures.\\" =Climate and population pressure= A child suffering extreme starvation in India, 1972 Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population has made popular the theory of the Malthusian catastrophe‚Äîthat many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries whose population exceeds the regional carrying capacity. However, Professor Alex de Waal, Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation, refutes the Malthus theory, looking instead to political factors as major causes of recent (over the last 150 years) famines. Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as drought, crop failure, or pestilence. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and epidemic diseases such as the Black Death helped to cause hundreds of famines in Europe during the Middle Ages, including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.\\"Poor studies will always be with us\\", The Telegraph In France, the Hundred Years' War, crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two- thirds.Don O'Reilly, \\"Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orl√©ans \\", TheHistoryNet.com The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as drought, can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the carrying capacity of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with subsistence agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; Arizona and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade. Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the Mount Tambora volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions. =State-sponsored famines= In certain cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China (which produced the largest famine in absolute numbers), North Korea in the mid-1990s, or Zimbabwe in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy. forced collectivization of agriculture was one of the main causes of the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. In 1932, under the rule of the USSR, Ukraine experienced one of its largest famines when between 2.4 and 7.5 million peasants died as a result of a state sponsored famine. It was termed the Holodomor, suggesting that it was a deliberate campaign of repression designed to eliminate resistance to collectivization. Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and a brutal reign of terror contributed to the widespread famine. The Soviet government continued to deny the problem and it did not provide aid to the victims nor did it accept foreign aid. Several contemporary scholars dispute the notion that the famine was deliberately inflicted by the Soviet government. In 1958 in China, Mao Zedong's Communist Government launched the Great Leap Forward campaign, aimed at rapidly industrializing the country. The government forcibly took control of agriculture. Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation occurred in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine and the government attempted to conceal it. While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 and 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the deadliest famines to date. Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers despite the strictures imposed by the World Bank. During the 1973 Wollo Famine in Ethiopia, food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of Addis Ababa, where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the dictatorships of Ethiopia and Sudan suffered massive famines, but the democracy of Botswana avoided them, despite also suffering a severe drop in national food production. In Somalia, famine occurred because of a failed state. The famine in Yemen was a direct result of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and the blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, including the United States.\\"Congress Votes to Say It Hasn't Authorized War in Yemen, Yet War in Yemen Goes On\\". The Intercept. 14 November 2017. According to the UN, 130 children under 5 years of age were dying from starvation and starvation related diseases every day by the end of 2017, with 50,000 dead for the year. As of October 2018, half the population is at risk of famine. Famines since 1850 by political regime According to Amartya Sen (1999), \\"there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy\\". Hasell and Roser have demonstrated that while there have been a few minor exceptions, famines rarely occur in democratic systems but are strongly correlated with autocratic and colonial systems. Famine prevention A starving child during the 1869 famine in Algeria. Relief technologies, including immunization, improved public health infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impact of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from genocide campaigns, civil wars, agro-terrorism, refugee flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations. Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network labelled Niger with emergency status, as well as Chad, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe. In January 2006, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned that 11 million people in Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts. In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in Sudan's region Darfur. Frances Moore Lapp√©, later co-founder of the Institute for Food and Development Policy (Food First) argued in Diet for a Small Planet (1971) that vegetarian diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets. Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist Amartya Sen states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. Alex de Waal has developed this theory to focus on the \\"political contract\\" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments. A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. Russia, 1921. The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population‚Äîadult women‚Äîlesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a \\"rebound\\" with increased births. Even though the theories of Thomas Malthus would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958‚Äì61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983‚Äì85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the 1840s famines by waves of emigration. =Overall food production= right Globally, the amount of food produced per person has kept rising, despite a growing world population. A local crop failure does not cause a famine unless there is also a lack of money to buy food from elsewhere. A war or political oppression can also disrupt distribution of otherwise adequate global supplies.Food Is Growing More Plentiful, So Why Do People Keep Warning Of Shortages? =Food security= Long term measures to improve food security, include investment in modern agriculture techniques, such as fertilizers and irrigation,\\"Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion\\", The New York Times, 9 July 2009 but can also include strategic national food storage. World Bank strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.\\"Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts\\", The New York Times, 2 December 2007 Norman Borlaug, father of the Green Revolution, is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the Western world, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to the Indian Sub-continent, called the Green Revolution, resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available. Supporting farmers in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices. The World Bank and some rich nations press nations that depend on them for aid to cut back or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of privatization even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers. =Relief= There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable. The United Nations' World Food Program (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a \\"revolution\\" in food aid.http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&Key;=2899 The aid agency Concern Worldwide is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another. However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help. Fred Cuny stated that \\"the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died.\\"Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development) US Law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport. Fred Cuny further pointed out \\"studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country‚Äîthough not always in the immediate food deficit area\\" and \\"even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad.\\"memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York) ‚Äì July 1994 Deficient micronutrients can be provided through fortifying foods. Fortifying foods such as peanut butter sachets (see Plumpy'Nut) have revolutionized emergency feeding in humanitarian emergencies because they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with scarce clean water, can be stored for years and, vitally, can be absorbed by extremely ill children.

Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.\\" There is a special oral rehydration solution called ReSoMal which has less sodium and more potassium than standard solution. However, if the diarrhea is severe, the standard solution is preferable as the person needs the extra sodium. Obviously, this is a judgment call best made by a physician, and using either solution is better than doing nothing. Zinc supplements often can help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea, and Vitamin A can also be helpful. The World Health Organization underlines the importance of a person with diarrhea continuing to eat, with a 2005 publication for physicians stating: \\"Food should never be withheld and the child's usual foods should not be diluted. Breastfeeding should always be continued.\\" Ethiopia has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. The Green Revolution was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%. Some criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which can harm the environment. Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as groundwater overdrafting and overuse of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. =Levels of food insecurity= Freshly-dug graves for child victims of the 2011 East Africa drought, Dadaab refugee camp, Kenya In modern times, local and political governments and non- governmental organizations that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously. Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief. One of the earliest were the Indian Famine Codes devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near- scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems. The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the Turkana people in northern Kenya also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the \\"livelihoods approach\\" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement income, etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of agricultural land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass starvation. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving markets, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity. Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the World Food Programme and the U.S. Agency for International Development, have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a \\"minor famine\\" and a \\"catastrophic famine\\" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths. Society and culture Famine personified as an allegory is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in Christian tradition, the fear gorta of Irish folklore, or the Wendigo of Algonquian tradition.

It asks Babington to use the‚Äîbroken‚Äîcipher to tell her the names of the conspirators. The Babington Plot was a plan in 1586 to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, a Protestant, and put Mary, Queen of Scots, her Roman Catholic cousin, on the English throne. It led to the Queen of Scots' execution, a result of a letter sent by Mary (who had been imprisoned for 19 years since 1568 in England at the behest of Elizabeth) in which she consented to the assassination of Elizabeth. The long-term goal of the plot was the invasion of England by the Spanish forces of King Philip II and the Catholic League in France, leading to the restoration of the old religion. The plot was discovered by Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and used to entrap Mary for the purpose of removing her as a claimant to the English throne. The chief conspirators were Anthony Babington and John Ballard. Babington, a young recusant, was recruited by Ballard, a Jesuit priest who hoped to rescue the Scottish Queen. Working for Walsingham were double agents Robert Poley and Gilbert Gifford, as well as Thomas Phelippes, the last a spy agent and cryptanalyst. The turbulent Catholic deacon Gifford had been in Walsingham's service since the end of 1585 or the beginning of 1586. Gifford obtained a letter of introduction to Queen Mary from a confidant and spy for her, Thomas Morgan. Walsingham then placed double agent Gifford and spy decipherer Phelippes inside Chartley Castle, where Queen Mary was imprisoned. Gifford organised the Walsingham plan to place Babington's and Queen Mary's encrypted communications into a beer barrel cork which were then intercepted by Phelippes, decoded and sent to Walsingham.Anthony Babington, Dictionary of National Biography (1895). http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/AnthonyBabington.htm On 7 July 1586, the only Babington letter that was sent to Mary was decoded by Phelippes. Mary responded in code on 17 July ordering the would-be rescuers to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. The response letter also included deciphered phrases indicating her desire to be rescued: \\"The affairs being thus prepared\\" and \\"I may suddenly be transported out of this place\\". At the Fotheringay trial in October 1586, Elizabeth's Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley and Walsingham used the letter against Mary who refused to admit that she was guilty. But she was betrayed by her secretaries Nau and Curle who confessed under pressure that the letter was mainly truthful. Mary's imprisonment Mary in captivity, c. 1578 Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, was regarded by Roman Catholics as the legitimate heir to the throne of England. In 1568 she escaped imprisonment by Scottish rebels and sought the aid of her first cousin once removed, Queen Elizabeth I, a year after her forced abdication from the throne of Scotland. The issuance of the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis by Pope Pius V on 25 February 1570, granted English Catholics authority to overthrow the English queen. Queen Mary became the focal point of numerous plots and intrigues to restore England to its former religion, Catholicism, and to depose Elizabeth and even to take her life. Rather than the expected aid, Elizabeth imprisoned Mary for nineteen years in the charge of a succession of jailers, principally the Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1564 Elizabeth's Privy Council signed a \\"Bond of Association\\" designed by Cecil and Walsingham which stated that anyone within the line of succession to the throne on whose behalf anyone plotted against the Queen, would be excluded from the line and executed. This was agreed upon by hundreds of Englishmen, who likewise signed the Bond. Mary also agreed to sign the Bond. The following year, Parliament passed the Act of Association, which provided for the execution of anyone who would benefit from the death of the Queen if a plot against her was discovered. Because of the bond, Mary could be executed if a plot was initiated by others that could lead to her accession to England's throne. Queen Elizabeth ordered Queen Mary transferred back to the ruined Tutbury Castle in the wintry weather of Christmas Eve 1569.Marie Stuart Society Mary, Queen of Scots: England: Calendar State Papers Scotland vol.3 (1903), p.17, 21, 34, 36, 40-41 Mary became ill because of the bad conditions of her captivity, imprisoned in a very damp cold room with closed windows and with no access to the sun. In 1585, Elizabeth ordered Mary to be transferred in a coach and under heavy guard and placed under the strictest confinement at Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, under the control of Sir Amias Paulet. She was prohibited any correspondence with the outside world. Puritan Paulet was chosen by Queen Elizabeth in part because he abhorred Queen Mary's Catholic faith. Sir Francis Walsingham Reacting to the growing threat posed by Catholics, urged on by the pope and other Catholic monarchs in Europe, Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State and spymaster, together with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief advisor, realised that if Mary could be implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth, she could be executed and the papist threat diminished. As he wrote to the Earl of Leicester: \\"So long as that devilish woman lives, neither Her Majesty must make an account to continue in quiet possession of her crown, nor her faithful servants assure themselves of the safety of their lives.\\", as quoted by Walsingham used Babington to ensnare Queen Mary by sending his double agent, Gilbert Gifford to Paris to obtain the confidence of Morgan, then locked in the Bastille. Morgan previously worked for George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, an earlier jailor of Queen Mary. Through Shrewsbury, Queen Mary became acquainted with Morgan. Queen Mary sent Morgan to Paris to deliver letters to the French court. While in Paris, Morgan became involved in a previous plot designed by William Parry, which resulted in Morgan's incarceration in the Bastille. In 1585 Gifford was arrested returning to England while coming through Rye in Sussex with letters of introduction from Morgan to Queen Mary. Walsingham released Gifford to work as a double agent, in the Babington Plot. Gifford used the alias \\"No. 4\\" just as he had used other aliases such as Colerdin, Pietro and Cornelys. Walsingham had Gifford function as a courier in the entrapment plot against Queen Mary. Plot The Babington plot was related to several separate plans: *solicitation of a Spanish invasion of England with the purpose of deposing Protestant Queen Elizabeth and replacing her with Catholic Queen Mary; *a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. At the behest of Mary's French supporters, John Ballard, a Jesuit priest and agent of the Roman Church, went to England on various occasions in 1585 to secure promises of aid from the northern Catholic gentry on behalf of Mary. In March 1586, he met with John Savage, an ex-soldier who was involved in a separate plot against Elizabeth and who had sworn an oath to assassinate the queen. He was resolved in this plot after consulting with three friends: Dr. William Gifford, Christopher Hodgson and Gilbert Gifford. Gilbert Gifford had been arrested by Walsingham and agreed to be a double agent. Gifford was already in Walsingham's employ by the time Savage was going ahead with the plot, according to Conyers Read. Later that same year, Gifford reported to Charles Paget and Don Bernardino de Mendoza, and told them that English Catholics were prepared to mount an insurrection against Elizabeth, provided that they would be assured of foreign support. While it was uncertain whether Ballard's report of the extent of Catholic opposition was accurate, what was certain is that he was able to secure assurances that support would be forthcoming. He then returned to England, where he persuaded a member of the Catholic gentry, Anthony Babington, to lead and organise the English Catholics against Elizabeth. Ballard informed Babington about the plans that had been so far proposed. Babington's later confession made it clear that Ballard was sure of the support of the Catholic League: Despite this assurance of this foreign support, Babington was hesitant, as he thought that no foreign invasion would succeed for as long as Elizabeth remained, to which Ballard answered that the plans of John Savage would take care of that. After a lengthy discussion with friends and soon-to- be fellow conspirators, Babington consented to join and to lead the conspiracy.Pollen, p. 54. Unfortunately for the conspirators, Walsingham was certainly aware of some of the aspects of the plot, based on reports by his spies, most notably Gilbert Gifford, who kept tabs on all the major participants. While he could have shut down some part of the plot and arrested some of those involved within reach, he still lacked any piece of evidence that would prove Queen Mary's active participation in the plot and he feared to commit any mistake which might cost Elizabeth her life. =Infiltration= The cipher code of Mary, Queen of Scots After the Throckmorton Plot, Queen Elizabeth had issued a decree in July 1584, which prevented all communication to and from Mary. However, Walsingham and Cecil realised that that decree also impaired their ability to entrap Mary. They needed evidence for which she could be executed based on their Bond of Association tenets. Thus Walsingham established a new line of communication, one which he could carefully control without incurring any suspicion from Mary. Gifford approached the French ambassador to England, Guillaume de l'Aubespine, Baron de Ch√¢teauneuf-sur- Cher, and described the new correspondence arrangement that had been designed by Walsingham. Gifford and jailer Paulet had arranged for a local brewer to facilitate the movement of messages between Queen Mary and her supporters by placing them in a watertight casing inside the stopper of a beer barrel. Thomas Phelippes, a cipher and language expert in Walsingham's employ, was then quartered at Chartley Hall to receive the messages, decode them and send them to Walsingham. Gifford submitted a code table (supplied by Walsingham) to Chateauneuf and requested the first message be sent to Mary. All subsequent messages to Mary would be sent via diplomatic packets to Chateauneuf, who then passed them on to Gifford. Gifford would pass them on to Walsingham, who would confide them to Phelippes. The cipher used was a nomenclator cipher. Phelippes would decode and make a copy of the letter. The letter was then resealed and given back to Gifford, who would pass it on to the brewer. The brewer would then smuggle the letter to Mary. If Mary sent a letter to her supporters, it would go through the reverse process. In short order, every message coming to and from Chartley Hall was intercepted and read by Walsingham. Correspondence This letter was received by Mary on 14 July 1586, who was in a dark mood knowing that her son had betrayed her in favour of Elizabeth, and three days later she replied to Babington in a long letter in which she outlined the components of a successful rescue and the need to assassinate Elizabeth. She also stressed the necessity of foreign aid if the rescue attempt was to succeed: Mary, in her response letter, advised the would-be rescuers to confront the Puritans and to link her case to the Queen of England as her heir. Mary was clear in her support for the murder of Elizabeth if that would have led to her liberty and Catholic domination of England. In addition, Queen Mary supported in that letter, and in another one to Ambassador Mendoza, a Spanish invasion of England. The letter was again intercepted and deciphered by Phelippes. But this time, Phelippes, on the direction of Walsingham, kept the original and made a copy, adding a request for the names of the conspirators: Then, a letter was sent that would destroy Mary's life. Arrests, trials and executions The execution of Queen Mary John Ballard was arrested on 4 August 1586, and under torture he confessed and implicated Babington. Although Babington was able to receive the letter with the postscript, he was not able to reply with the names of the conspirators, as he was arrested. Others were taken prisoner by 15 August 1586. Mary's two secretaries, Claude Nau de la Boisseli√®re and Gilbert Curle, were likewise taken into custody and interrogated. The conspirators were sentenced to death for treason and conspiracy against the crown, and were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. This first group included Babington, Ballard, Chidiock Tichborne, Thomas Salisbury, Henry Donn, Robert Barnewell and John Savage. A further group of seven men including Edward Habington, Charles Tilney, Edward Jones, John Charnock, John Travers, Jerome Bellamy, and Robert Gage, were tried and convicted shortly afterward. Ballard and Babington were executed on 20 September 1586 along with the other men who had been tried with them. Such was the public outcry at the horror of their execution that Elizabeth changed the order for the second group to be allowed to hang until \\"quite dead\\" before disembowelling and quartering. In October 1586 Mary was sent to be tried at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire by 46 English lords, bishops and earls. She was not permitted legal counsel, not permitted to review the evidence against her, nor to call witnesses. Portions of Phellipes' letter translations were read at the trial. Mary was convicted of treason against England. One English Lord voted not guilty. Elizabeth signed her cousin-once- removed's death warrant,Francis Edwards, S.J., Plots and plotters in the reign of Elizabeth I. (Dublin: Four Courts, 2002), p. 164. and on 8 February 1587, in front of 300 witnesses, Mary, Queen of Scots, was executed by beheading.Fraser p. 635 In literature Mary Stuart (), a dramatised version of the last days of Mary, Queen of Scots, including the Babington Plot, was written by Friedrich Schiller and performed in Weimar, Germany, in 1800. This in turn formed the basis for Maria Stuarda, an opera by Donizetti, in 1835. Although the Babington Plot occurs before the events of the opera, and is only referenced twice during the opera, the second such occasion being Mary admitting her own part in it in private to her confessor (a role taken by Lord Talbot in the opera, although not in real life). The story of the Babington Plot is dramatised in the novel Conies in the Hay by Jane Lane (), and features prominently in Anthony Burgess's A Dead Man in Deptford. A fictional account is given in the My Story book series, The Queen's Spies (retitled To Kill A Queen 2008) told in diary format by a fictional Elizabethan girl, Kitty. The Babington plot forms the historical background ‚Äì and provides much of the intrigue ‚Äì for Holy Spy, the 7th in the historical detective series by Rory Clements, featuring John Shakespeare, an intelligencer for Walsingham and elder brother of the more famous Will. The simplified version of the Babington plot is also the subject of the children's or Young Adult novel, A Traveller in Time (1939), by Alison Uttley, who grew up near the Babington family home in Derbyshire. A young modern girl finds that she slips back to the time shortly before the Plot is about to be implemented. This was later made into a BBC TV mini-series in 1978, with small changes to the original novel. The Babington Plot is also dramatized in the 2017 Ken Follett novel A Column of Fire, in Jacopo della Quercia's 2015 novel License to Quill and in SJ Parris‚Äôs 2020 novel Execution, the latest of her novels featuring Giordano Bruno as protagonist. The plot figures prominently in the first chapter of The Code Book, a survey of the history of cryptography written by Simon Singh and published in 1999. Dramatic adaptations Episode four of the television series Elizabeth R (titled \\"Horrible Conspiracies\\") is devoted to the Babington Plot, and the movie Elizabeth: The Golden Age deals with it as well. A 45-minute drama entitled The Babington Plot, written by Michael Butt and directed by Sasha Yevtushenko, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 2 December 2008. This drama took the form of a documentary on the one-year anniversary of the executions, with the story being told from the perspective of Thomas Salisbury, Robert Poley, Gilbert Gifford and others who, while not conspirators, are in some way connected with the events, all of whom are interviewed by the Presenter (played by Stephen Greif). The cast also included Samuel Barnett as Thomas Salisbury, Burn Gorman as Robert Poley, Jonathan Taffler as Thomas Phelippes and Inam Mirza as Gilbert Gifford.

Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics. An example of a quantity that has a dimension is time, measured in seconds.  History  Quantities having dimension 1, dimensionless quantities, regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of dimensional analysis. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician Joseph Fourier and Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell led significant developments in the modern concepts of dimension and unit. Later work by British physicists Osborne Reynolds and Lord Rayleigh contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics. Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, Edgar Buckingham proved the theorem (independently of French mathematician Joseph Bertrand's previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities. Numerous dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s, particularly in the areas of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Measuring ratios in the (derived) unit dB (decibel) finds widespread use nowadays. In the early 2000s, the International Committee for Weights and Measures discussed naming the unit of 1 as the \\"uno\\", but the idea of just introducing a new SI name for 1 was dropped.  Pure numbers  All pure numbers are dimensionless quantities, for example 1, , , , and . Units of number such as the dozen, gross, googol, and Avogadro's number may also be considered dimensionless.  Ratios, proportions, and angles  Dimensionless quantities are often obtained as ratios of quantities that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation.http://web.mit.edu/6.055/old/S2008/notes/apr02a.pdf Examples include calculating slopes or unit conversion factors. A more complex example of such a ratio is engineering strain, a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension length, their ratio is dimensionless. Another set of examples is mass fractions or mole fractions often written using parts-per notation such as ppm (= 10‚àí6), ppb (= 10‚àí9), and ppt (= 10‚àí12), or perhaps confusingly as ratios of two identical units (kg/kg or mol/mol). For example, alcohol by volume, which characterizes the concentration of ethanol in an alcoholic beverage, could be written as . Other common proportions are percentages % (= 0.01), ‚Ä∞ (= 0.001) and angle units such as radian, degree (¬∞ = ) and grad (= ). In statistics the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to measure the dispersion in the data. It has been argued that quantities defined as ratios having equal dimensions in numerator and denominator are actually only unitless quantities and still have physical dimension defined as . For example, moisture content may be defined as a ratio of volumes (volumetric moisture, m3‚ãÖm‚àí3, dimension L‚ãÖL) or as a ratio of masses (gravimetric moisture, units kg‚ãÖkg‚Äì1, dimension M‚ãÖM); both would be unitless quantities, but of different dimension.  Buckingham theorem  The Buckingham theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by Boyle's Law ‚Äì they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold. Another consequence of the theorem is that the functional dependence between a certain number (say, n) of variables can be reduced by the number (say, k) of independent dimensions occurring in those variables to give a set of p = n ‚àí k independent, dimensionless quantities. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless quantity are equivalent. = Example = To demonstrate the application of the theorem, consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape. The power, P, in dimensions [M ¬∑ L2/T3], is a function of the density, œÅ [M/L3], and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred, Œº [M/(L ¬∑ T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter, D [L], and the angular speed of the stirrer, n [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of n = 5 variables representing our example. Those n = 5 variables are built up from k = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L (SI units: m), time: T (s), and mass: M (kg). According to the -theorem, the n = 5 variables can be reduced by the k = 3 dimensions to form p = n ‚àí k = 5 ‚àí 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. These quantities are \\\\mathrm{Re} = {\\\\frac{\\\\rho n D^2}{\\\\mu}}, commonly named the Reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime, and N_\\\\mathrm{p} = \\\\frac{P}{\\\\rho n^3 D^5}, the power number, which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.  Dimensionless physical constants  Certain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, the universal gravitational constant, Planck's constant, Coulomb's constant, and Boltzmann's constant can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for time, length, mass, charge, and temperature are chosen. The resulting system of units is known as the natural units, specifically regarding these five constants, Planck units. However, not all physical constants can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally: * Œ± ‚âà 1/137, the fine-structure constant, which characterizes the magnitude of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons. * Œ≤ (or Œº) ‚âà 1836, the proton- to-electron mass ratio. This ratio is the rest mass of the proton divided by that of the electron. An analogous ratio can be defined for any elementary particle; * Œ±s ‚âà 1, a constant characterizing the strong nuclear force coupling strength; * The ratio of the mass of any given elementary particle to the Planck mass, \\\\sqrt{\\\\hbar c/G}.  Other quantities produced by nondimensionalization  Physics often uses dimensionless quantities to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena. These may be found by applying the Buckingham theorem or otherwise may emerge from making partial differential equations unitless by the process of nondimensionalization. Engineering, economics, and other fields often extend these ideas in design and analysis of the relevant systems. = Physics and engineering = * Fresnel number ‚Äì wavenumber over distance * Mach number ‚Äì ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid. * Beta (plasma physics) ‚Äì ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, used in magnetospheric physics as well as fusion plasma physics. * Damk√∂hler numbers (Da) ‚Äì used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system. * Thiele modulus ‚Äì describes the relationship between diffusion and reaction rate in porous catalyst pellets with no mass transfer limitations. * Numerical aperture ‚Äì characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. * Sherwood number ‚Äì (also called the mass transfer Nusselt number) is a dimensionless number used in mass- transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the convective mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport. * Schmidt number ‚Äì defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and mass diffusivity, and is used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes. * Reynolds number is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow, incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow. It is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes. = Chemistry = * Relative density ‚Äì density relative to water * Relative atomic mass, Standard atomic weight * Equilibrium constant (which is sometimes dimensionless) = Other fields = * Cost of transport is the efficiency in moving from one place to another * Elasticity is the measurement of the proportional change of an economic variable in response to a change in another  See also  * Arbitrary unit * Dimensional analysis * Normalization (statistics) and standardized moment, the analogous concepts in statistics * Orders of magnitude (numbers) * Similitude (model) References External links * Mathematical concepts Physical constants ","title":"Dimensionless quantity"},{"id":"51332","text":": For Newton number, see also Kissing number in the sphere packing problem.

Sen has made contributions to welfare economics, social choice theory, economic and social justice, economic theories of famines, decision theory, development economics, public health, and measures of well-being of countries. He is currently Thomas W. Lamont University Professor, and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 and India's Bharat Ratna in 1999 for his work in welfare economics. The German Publishers and Booksellers Association awarded him the 2020 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade for his pioneering scholarship addressing issues of global justice and combating social inequality in education and healthcare. Early life and education 'Pratichi', Sen's house in Shantiniketan Amartya Sen was born in a Hindu family in Bengal, British India. Rabindranath Tagore gave Amartya Sen his name (Bengali ‡¶Ö‡¶Æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø √¥morto, lit. \\"immortal or heavenly\\"). Sen's family was from Wari and Manikganj, Dhaka, both in present-day Bangladesh. His father Ashutosh Sen was Professor of Chemistry at Dhaka University, Development Commissioner in Delhi and then Chairman of the West Bengal Public Service Commission. He moved with his family to West Bengal in 1945. Sen's mother Amita Sen was the daughter of Kshiti Mohan Sen, the eminent Sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval India, who was a close associate of Rabindranath Tagore. K.M. Sen served as the second Vice Chancellor of Visva Bharati University from 1953 to 1954. Sen began his school education at St Gregory's School in Dhaka in 1940. In the fall of 1941, Sen was admitted to Patha Bhavana, Shantiniketan, where he completed his school education. The school had many progressive features, such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world. In 1951, he went to Presidency College, Kolkata, where he earned a B.A. in Economics with First in the First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the University of Calcutta. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living five years. With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a second B.A. in Economics in 1955 with a First Class, topping the list as well. At this time, he was elected President of the Cambridge Majlis. While Sen was officially a PhD student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955‚Äì56), he was offered the position of First-Professor and First-Head of the Economics Department of the newly created Jadavpur University in Calcutta. He is still the youngest chairman to have headed the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, from 1956 to 1958. Meanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked; he made the radical decision to study philosophy. Sen explained: \\"The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, social choice theory makes intense use of mathematical logic and also draws on moral philosophy, and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own.\\" His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes. One of the books he was most interested in was Kenneth Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values. In Cambridge, there were major debates between supporters of Keynesian economics, and the neo-classical economists who were skeptical of Keynes. Because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen chose a different subject for his PhD thesis, which was on \\"The Choice of Techniques\\" in 1959. The work had been completed earlier, except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, Professor A.K. Dasgupta, given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur, under the supervision of the \\"brilliant but vigorously intolerant\\" post-Keynesian, Joan Robinson. Quentin Skinner notes that Sen was a member of the secret society Cambridge Apostles during his time at Cambridge. During 1960‚Äì61, Amartya Sen visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on leave from Trinity College. Research work Sen's work on 'Choice of Techniques' complemented that of Maurice Dobb. In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive. Sen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of social choice, which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist Kenneth Arrow. Arrow, while working at the RAND Corporation, had most famously shown that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any ranked order voting system will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions Arrow's impossibility theorem applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in history of economic thought and philosophy. Official Portrait at the Nobel Prize In 1981, Sen published Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices, thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up. Sen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the Bengal famine of 1943, in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like barbers did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include British military acquisition, panic buying, hoarding, and price gouging, all connected to the war in the region. In Poverty and Famines, Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non- famine years. Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation. His capabilities approach focuses on positive freedom, a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on negative freedom approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity. In addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the \\"Human Development Report\\", Pdf version. published by the United Nations Development Programme. Draft This annual publication that ranks countries on a variety of economic and social indicators owes much to the contributions by Sen among other social choice theorists in the area of economic measurement of poverty and inequality. Sen's revolutionary contribution to development economics and social indicators is the concept of \\"capability\\" developed in his article Equality of What. Pdf version. He argues that governments should be measured against the concrete capabilities of their citizens. This is because top-down development will always trump human rights as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a \\"right\\" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have \\"functionings\\". These \\"functionings\\" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the polls. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the \\"capabilities approach\\" in practice, see Martha Nussbaum's Women and Human Development. He wrote a controversial article in The New York Review of Books entitled \\"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing\\" (see Missing women of Asia), analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia. Other studies, including one by Emily Oster, had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions. In 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book Development as Freedom. Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age. In Development as Freedom, Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms. Both countries were working towards developing their economies, China since 1979 and India since 1991. Welfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well-being of the community. Sen, who devoted his career to such issues, was called the \\"conscience of his profession\\". His influential monograph Collective Choice and Social Welfare (1970), which addressed problems related to individual rights (including formulation of the liberal paradox), justice and equity, majority rule, and the availability of information about individual conditions, inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare. Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor. For instance, his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in India and in China despite the fact that in the West and in poor but medically unbiased countries, women have lower mortality rates at all ages, live longer, and make a slight majority of the population. Sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries, as well as sex-selective abortions. Governments and international organisations handling food crises were influenced by Sen's work. His views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor‚Äîfor example through public works‚Äîand to maintain stable prices for food. A vigorous defender of political freedom, Sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens. In order for economic growth to be achieved, he argued, social reforms‚Äîsuch as improvements in education and public health‚Äîmust precede economic reform. In 2009, Sen published a book called The Idea of Justice. Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of John Rawls or John Harsanyi. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau or David Hume, and inspired by the philosophical works of Adam Smith and Mary Wollstonecraft, Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important. As an alternative to Rawls's veil of ignorance, Sen chose the thought experiment of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of John Stuart Mill) and a focus on people's capabilities (an approach that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice. Career Sen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the Department of Economics, Jadavpur University as a Professor of Economics in 1956. He spent two years in that position. From 1957 to 1963, Sen served as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Between 1960 and 1961, Sen was a visiting Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, where he got to know Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Franco Modigliani, and Norbert Wiener. He was also a visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1964-1965) and Cornell University (1978-1984). He taught as Professor of Economics between 1963 and 1971 at the Delhi School of Economics (where he completed his magnum opus Collective Choice and Social Welfare in 1969). During this time Sen was also a frequent visitor to various other premiere Indian economic schools and centres of excellence like Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indian Statistical Institute, Centre for Development Studies, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics and Centre for Studies in Social Sciences. He was a companion of distinguished economists like Manmohan Singh (Ex-Prime Minister of India and a veteran economist responsible for liberalizing the Indian economy), K. N. Raj (Advisor to various Prime Ministers and a veteran economist who was the founder of Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum, which is one of India's premier think tanks and schools) and Jagdish Bhagwati (who is known to be one of the greatest Indian economists in the field of International Trade and currently teaches at Columbia University). This is a period considered to be a Golden Period in the history of DSE. In 1971, he joined the London School of Economics as a Professor of Economics where he taught until 1977. From 1977 to 1988, he taught at the University of Oxford, where he was first a Professor of Economics and Fellow of Nuffield College, and then the Drummond Professor of Political Economy and a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford from 1980. In 1987, Sen joined Harvard as the Thomas W. Lamont University Professor of Economics. In 1998 he was appointed as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming the first Asian head of an Oxbridge college. In January 2004, Sen returned to Harvard. He also established the Eva Colorni Trust at the former London Guildhall University in the name of his deceased wife. In May 2007, he was appointed as chairman of Nalanda Mentor Group to examine the framework of international cooperation, and proposed structure of partnership, which would govern the establishment of Nalanda International University Project as an international centre of education seeking to revive the ancient center of higher learning which was present in India from the 5th century to 1197. On 19 July 2012, Sen was named the first chancellor of the proposed Nalanda University (NU). Sen was criticized as the project suffered due to inordinate delays, mismanagement and lack of presence of faculty on ground. Finally teaching began in August 2014. On 20 February 2015, Sen withdrew his candidature for a second term. Membership and associations He has served as president of the Econometric Society (1984), the International Economic Association (1986‚Äì1989), the Indian Economic Association (1989) and the American Economic Association (1994). He has also served as President of the Development Studies Association and the Human Development and Capability Association. He serves as the honorary director of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Center for Human and Economic Development Studies at Peking University in China. Sen has been called \\"the Conscience of the profession\\" and \\"the Mother Teresa of Economics\\" for his work on famine, human development theory, welfare economics, the underlying mechanisms of poverty, gender inequality, and political liberalism. However, he denies the comparison to Mother Teresa, saying that he has never tried to follow a lifestyle of dedicated self-sacrifice. Amartya Sen also added his voice to the campaign against the anti-gay Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Sen has served as Honorary Chairman of Oxfam, the UK based international development charity, and is now its Honorary Advisor. Sen is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council. Sen is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.https://rsf.org/en/amartya-sen Media and culture A 56-minute documentary named Amartya Sen: A Life Re-examined directed by Suman Ghosh details his life and work. A documentary about Amartya Sen, titled The Argumentative Indian, was released in 2017. A 2001 portrait of Sen by Annabel Cullen is in Trinity College's collection. A 2003 portrait of Sen hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London. In 2011, he was present at the Rabindra Utsab ceremony at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre (BICC), Bangladesh. He unveiled the cover of Sruti Gitobitan, a Rabindrasangeet album comprising all the 2222 Tagore songs, brought out by Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya, principal of Shurer Dhara School of Music. Max Roser said that it was the work of Sen that made him create Our World in Data. Political views Sen was critical of Indian politician Narendra Modi when he was announced as their prime ministerial candidate by the BJP. In April 2014, he said that Modi would not make a good Prime Minister. He conceded later in December 2014 that Modi did give people a sense of faith that things can happen. In February 2015, Sen opted out of seeking a second term for the chancellor post of Nalanda University, stating that the Government of India was not keen on him continuing in the post. In August 2019, during the clampdown and curfew in Kashmir for more than two weeks after the Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Sen criticized the government and said \\"As an Indian, I am not proud of the fact that India, after having done so much to achieve a democratic norm in the world ‚Äì where India was the first non-Western country to go for democracy ‚Äì that we lose that reputation on the grounds of action that have been taken\\".\\"Not Proud As An Indian...\\": Amartya Sen's Critique Of Kashmir Move, NDTV, 19 August 2019.Kashmir without democracy not acceptable: Amartya, New Nation, 19 August 2019.

Personal life and beliefs Sen has been married three times. His first wife was Nabaneeta Dev Sen, an Indian writer and scholar, with whom he had two daughters: Antara, a journalist and publisher, and Nandana, a Bollywood actress. Their marriage broke up shortly after they moved to London in 1971. In 1978 Sen married Eva Colorni, an Italian economist, daughter of Eugenio Colorni and Ursula Hirschmann and niece of Albert O. Hirschman. The couple had two children, a daughter Indrani, who is a journalist in New York, and a son Kabir, a hip hop artist, MC, and music teacher at Shady Hill School. Eva died of cancer in 1985. In 1991, Sen married Emma Georgina Rothschild, who serves as the Jeremy and Jane Knowles Professor of History at Harvard University. The Sens have a house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is the base from which they teach during the academic year. They also have a home in Cambridge, England, where Sen is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Rothschild is a Fellow of Magdalene College. He usually spends his winter holidays at his home in Shantiniketan in West Bengal, India, where he used to go on long bike rides until recently. Asked how he relaxes, he replies: \\"I read a lot and like arguing with people.\\" Sen is an atheist and holds that this can be associated with one of the atheist schools in Hinduism, the Lokayata.

It is located north of the Antigua Island and is part of the Leeward Islands of the West Indies. Antigua and Barbuda gained full independence on 1 November 1981 as a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations. The island is a popular tourist destination because of its moderate climate and coastline. Historically, most of Barbuda's 1,634 residents have lived in the town of Codrington. However, in September 2017, Hurricane Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure and, as a result, all the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Antigua, leaving Barbuda empty for the first time in modern history. History The Ciboney (Guanahuatebey) peoples inhabited the area in the Stone Age.Riley, Frank. \\"Imagine a Different Beach for Every Day of Year\\". The Los Angeles Times. September 13, 1987. p. 6.Allahar, Anton L. \\"Unity and diversity in Caribbean ethnicity and culture\\". Canadian Ethnic Studies. Calgary25.1 . 1993. p. 70‚Äì84. The island was populated by Arawak and Carib Indians when Christopher Columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by the Spanish were followed by the French and English who formed a colony in 1666. In 1685, Barbuda was leased to brothers John and Christopher Codrington, who had founded the town of Codrington. The Codrington family produced food and transported slaves as labour for their sugarcane plantations on Antigua. During the 1740s, there were multiple slave rebellions at Codrington and all slaves were freed in 1834. On 1 November 1981, the island gained its independence as an integral part of Antigua and Barbuda, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. In a 1989 election, the Barbuda Independence Movement received too few votes to qualify for a seat in the national parliament. =Slavery= There is a widespread but disputed belief, shared by some Barbudans, that the Codringtons set up a human stock farm on Barbuda for the purpose of breeding the strongest, tallest enslaved people.Crocker, John. \\"Barbuda Eyes Statehood and Tourists\\". The Washington Post. January 28, 1968. p. E11.Fleck, Bryan. \\"Discover Unspoiled: Barbuda\\". Everybody's Brooklyn. October 31, 2004. p. 60. An article in the Annals of the New York Academy of Science has disputed this, stating that the Codringtons considered using Barbuda as a nursery, where slave children would have been raised to work on Antiguan plantations, but this plan was never realized. Other sources indicate that slaves were, in fact, an export commodity but this was probably due to natural population growth since no new slaves had arrived on the island since the mid-1700s. In any event, the island was certainly an exporter of slaves. An estimate in 1977 by Lowenthal and Clark indicated that between 1779 and 1834, 172 slaves were exported. Most were taken to Antigua, but 37 went to the Leeward and Windward islands, and some went to the southern US. Several slave rebellions took place on the island, with the most serious in 1834-1835. Britain emancipated slaves in most of its colonies in 1834, but that did not include Barbuda, so the island freed its own slaves at that time. For some years afterward, the freed slaves had little opportunity of survival on their own because of limited agricultural land and the lack of available credit to buy some. Therefore, they continued to work on the plantations for nominal wages or lived in shantytowns and worked as occasional labourers. Sugarcane production remained the primary economy for over a century. Effective trade unions were not formed until the 1930s. The first map of Barbuda was made in the second half of the 18th century. At that time there were substantial buildings in the Highland area, a castle in Codrington, a fort on the river, now known as the Martello Tower, and houses at Palmetto Point, Coco Point, and Castle Hill. The map shows eight catching pens for holding captured runaway slaves, indicating that this was a serious problem. There were several defensive cannon batteries around the island perimeter, as well as a large plantation in the Meadow and Guava area and another large plantation in the Highlands. =Barbuda Land Act= The Barbuda Land Act of 2007 establishes that the citizens of Barbuda communally own the land. The act specifies that residents must provide consent for major development projects on the island. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda passed the act on January 17, 2008. =Natural disasters= Hurricane Luis One of the most devastating hurricanes to strike the northern Leeward Islands in the 20th century, Hurricane Luis, a Category 4 storm, caused very extensive destruction to Barbuda in September 1995. Most houses were damaged or destroyed, with three deaths, 165 injuries, and power and water system disruptions. The hurricane left over 300 homeless; many lived in shelters for months. Estimated cost of rebuilding ranged from $100 million to $350 million. Not all damaged buildings were replaced, and in early 2013, only two very expensive hotels were operating in addition to a few cottages that were for rent. In fact, there were very few facilities for tourists. A report in early 2017 confirmed that there were still only two hotels; the primary attractions were the pristine beaches. Many of the accommodations listed on the TripAdvisor page for Barbuda were actually in Antigua. Hurricane Irma Satellite images of Antigua and Barbuda from August 21, 2017, and September 8, 2017, illustrating the damage caused by Hurricane Irma to Barbuda. The browning of the island was a result of extreme wind damage to foliage and desiccation of vegetation due to sea spray. 22 years after Hurricane Luis, Hurricane Irma caused catastrophic damage when it made landfall on the island on 6 September 2017. Prime Minister Gaston Browne stated that the Category 5 hurricane had destroyed 95% of the structures and vehicles on the island. Initial estimates showed that at least 60% of the island's residents were homeless because of the disaster.\\"Barbuda 'totally demolished' but Antigua spared, says PM* \\". Trinidad Express Newspaper. Caribbean Communication Network. September 6, 2017. All communications with Barbuda were down for a time; the storm had destroyed most of the communications system.Bosotti, Aurora. Hurricane Irma UPDATE: Barbuda diplomat says ALL CONTACT has been lost with island\\". Express Newspapers. September 6, 2017. On 8 September 2017, the government began to evacuate the entire island (with residents moved to Antigua) in anticipation of the Category 4 Hurricane Jose, which was approaching from the east. Nearly 1,800 residents were evacuated to Antigua; some were accommodated in the Sir Vivian Richards cricket stadium. A hurricane warning for Jose was issued for several islands, including Barbuda. On 14 September, Ronald Sanders, Ambassador to the US, described the situation on Barbuda: \\"There is no electricity there, there is no potable water anymore, there is no structure in which people can survive. We have a mammoth task on our hands.\\" He also stated this is the first time in 300 years that the island has not had a single living person on it. Sanders said, \\"We are a small island community ‚Äî the gross domestic product of Antigua is $1 billion a year. We cannot afford to take on this responsibility by ourselves. Barbuda is not just a disaster, it's a humanitarian crisis. We are hopeful that the international community will come to our aid, not because we're begging for something we want, but because we're begging for something that is needed.\\" The United States Agency for International Development confirmed its commitment to provide coordination between the government and aid organizations; it also sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team. On 8 September, the first of three cargo planes arrived in Antigua from the US, with over 120,000 pounds of relief supplies for Barbudans. The cost was covered by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and with donations from Martin Franklyn and the Coleman Company in the US. An estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. In a statement, Sanders stated that the reconstruction may cost up to $300 million. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that \\"all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent ‚Äì food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management... Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.\\" A report in April 2018 indicated that many of the few people living on the island were making do in tents; some government buildings were still being repaired. By that time, water and electricity were available in government buildings, the police station, the hospital and the post office in Codrington. Prime minister Gaston Browne said there were plans to build a new runway for jets at the airport but no specifics had been released. A house that was badly damaged by the hurricane By February 2019, an estimated 75% of residents had returned from Antigua. Both China and the European Union funded rebuilding efforts which restored parts of the residential housing. Plans by Prime Minister Gaston Browne to overturn the century-old Barbudan communal land ownership by allowing residents to purchase land they occupy has been criticised as promoting \\"disaster capitalism\\". Seen in relation with the planned construction of a new international airport, critics voiced concerns that the main benefactors would not be the local populace, but international companies aiming to establish mass tourism. Tourism Barbuda's climate, pristine beaches, and geography attracted tourists for many years. Barbuda was served by Barbuda Codrington Airport and also had a ferry service to Antigua. Activities included swimming, snorkeling, fishing, and caving. Years after Hurricane Luis, in August 2017, there were still only two operating resorts on the island, although plans were being made to build other resorts before Hurricane Irma. Attractions that were popular included the Frigate Bird Sanctuary in the Codrington Lagoon, Martello Tower, a 19th-century fort and the Indian Cave with its two rock-carved petroglyphs. Other points of interest included the beautiful Pink Sands Beach, Darby's Cave, a sinkhole with a tropical rain forest inside and Highland House (called Willybob locally), the ruins of the 18th-century Codrington family home, and the Dividing Wall that separated the wealthy family from its slaves. Geography The total land area is . The capital and largest town is Codrington, with an estimated population of 100 (2017 Estimated). More people of Barbudan descent live on Antigua rather than on the island itself. The island is mostly coral limestone with little topographical variation. The \\"highlands\\" area on the eastern side of the island has hills rising to , but the majority of the island is very flat, with many lagoons in the northwest corner. The island is susceptible to hurricanes between August and October. Wildlife Barbuda is home to some notable wildlife, including the Antiguan racer, which is among the rarest snakes in the world. The Lesser Antilles are home to four species of racers. All four have undergone severe range reductions; at least two subspecies are extinct, and another, A. antiguae, now occupies only 0.1% of its historical range. Griswold's ameiva (Ameiva griswoldi) is a species of lizard in the genus Ameiva. It is endemic to Antigua and Barbuda and is found on both islands. Climate The climate is classified as tropical marine, which means that there is little seasonal temperature variation. In January and February, the coolest months, the average daily high temperature is , while in July and August, the warmest months, the average daily high is . Education Like in Antigua, the education in Barbuda follows the British system with its three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. It is free and compulsory for students up to the age of 16.Kras, p. 83. The educational policy focuses on the philosophy that \\"each child should first be socialized as a human being and secondly as an economic unit of production.\\" See also the Education in Antigua and Barbuda for more information about education in the island.

They are commonly but inaccurately referred to as dioxins for simplicity, because every PCDD molecule contains a dibenzo-1,4-dioxin skeletal structure, with 1,4-dioxin as the central ring. Members of the PCDD family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their lipophilic properties, and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer. Dioxins occur as by-products in the manufacture of some organochlorides, in the incineration of chlorine- containing substances such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), in the chlorine bleaching of paper, and from natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires. There have been many incidents of dioxin pollution resulting from industrial emissions and accidents; the earliest such incidents were in the mid 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. The word \\"dioxins\\" may also refer to other similarly acting chlorinated compounds (see Dioxins and dioxin- like compounds). Chemical structure of dibenzo-1,4-dioxins The skeletal formula and substituent numbering scheme of the parent compound dibenzo-1,4-dioxin The structure of dibenzo-1,4-dioxin consists of two benzene rings joined by two oxygen bridges. This makes the compound an aromatic diether. The name dioxin formally refers to the central dioxygenated ring, which is stabilized by the two flanking benzene rings. In PCDDs, chlorine atoms are attached to this structure at any of 8 different places on the molecule, at positions 1‚Äì4 and 6‚Äì9. There are 75 different PCDD congeners (that is, related dioxin compounds).Nomenclature and physico-chemical properties of PCDDs and PCDFs. In: Dioxins in the Environment: What are the health risks? INSERM Collective Expert Evaluation Reports (2000). Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (2011-03-18). Retrieved on 2011-06-09. The toxicity of PCDDs depends on the number and positions of the chlorine atoms. Congeners that have chlorine in the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions have been found to be significantly toxic. In fact, 7 congeners have chlorine atoms in the relevant positions which were considered toxic by the World Health Organization toxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) scheme. Historical perspective Structure of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) Low concentrations of dioxins existed in nature prior to industrialization as a result of natural combustion and geological processes. Dioxins were first unintentionally produced as by- products from 1848 onwards as Leblanc process plants started operating in Germany. The first intentional synthesis of chlorinated dibenzodioxin was in 1872. Today, concentrations of dioxins are found in all humans, with higher levels commonly found in persons living in more industrialized countries. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), became well known as a contaminant of Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. Later, dioxins were found in Times Beach, Missouri and Love Canal, New York and Seveso, Italy. More recently, dioxins have been in the news with the poisoning of President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine in 2004, the Naples Mozzarella Crisis the 2008 Irish pork crisis, and the German feed incident of 2010.http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112012011_dioxin_germany.pdf Sources of dioxins The United States Environmental Protection Agency inventory of sources of dioxin-like compounds is possibly the most comprehensive review of the sources and releases of dioxins, EPA/600/P-03/002f, Final Report but other countries now have substantial research as well. Concentration profile of PCDD in a dated sediment core from Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, UK Occupational exposure is an issue for some in the chemical industries, historically for those making chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides or in the application of chemicals, notably herbicides. In many developed nations there are now emissions regulations which have dramatically decreased the emissions and thus alleviated some concerns, although the lack of continuous sampling of dioxin emissions causes concern about the understatement of emissions. In Belgium, through the introduction of a process called AMESA, continuous sampling showed that periodic sampling understated emissions by a factor of 30 to 50 times. Few facilities have continuous sampling. Dioxins are produced in small concentrations when organic material is burned in the presence of chlorine, whether the chlorine is present as chloride ions or as organochlorine compounds, so they are widely produced in many contexts. According to the most recent US EPA data, the major sources of dioxins are broadly in the following types: *Combustion sources, e.g. municipal waste or medical waste incinerators and private backyard barrel burning *Metal smelting *Refining and process sources *Chemical manufacturing sources *Natural sources *Environmental reservoirs When first carried out in 1987, the original US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal solid waste, medical waste, sewage sludge, and hazardous waste together now produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, and is now the largest source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output. In incineration, dioxins can also reform or form de novo in the atmosphere above the stack as the exhaust gases cool through a temperature window of 600 to 200 ¬∞C. The most common method of reducing the quantity of dioxins reforming or forming de novo is through rapid (30 millisecond) quenching of the exhaust gases through that 400 ¬∞C window. Incinerator emissions of dioxins have been reduced by over 90% as a result of new emissions control requirements. Incineration in developed countries is now a very minor contributor to dioxin emissions. Dioxins are also generated in reactions that do not involve burning ‚Äî such as chlorine bleaching fibers for paper or textiles, and in the manufacture of chlorinated phenols, particularly when reaction temperature is not well controlled. Compounds involved include the wood preservative pentachlorophenol, and also herbicides such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (or 2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). Higher levels of chlorination require higher reaction temperatures and greater dioxin production. Dioxins may also be formed during the photochemical breakdown of the common antimicrobial compound triclosan. Sources of human intake A chart illustrating how much dioxin the average American consumes per day. (Note: pg = picogram, or one trillionth of a gram, or 10‚àí12 g). Tolerable daily, monthly or annual intakes have been set by the World Health Organization and a number of governments. Dioxins enter the general population almost exclusively from ingestion of food, specifically through the consumption of fish, meat, and dairy products since dioxins are fat-soluble and readily climb the food chain. Children are passed substantial body burdens by their mothers, and breastfeeding increases the child's body burden. Dioxin exposure can also occur from contact with Pentachlorophenol (Penta) treated lumber as Pentachlorophenol often contains dioxins as a contaminant. Children's daily intakes during breast feeding are often many times above the intakes of adults based on body weight. This is why the WHO consultation group assessed the tolerable intake so as to prevent a woman from accumulating harmful body burdens before her first pregnancy. Breast fed children usually still have higher dioxin body burdens than non breast fed children. The WHO still recommends breast feeding for its other benefits.Healthy Milk, Healthy Baby ‚Äì Chemical Pollution and Mother's Milk ‚Äì Chemicals: Dioxins and Furans. Nrdc.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-09. In many countries dioxins in breast milk have decreased by even 90% during the two last decades. Dioxins are present in cigarette smoke. Dioxin in cigarette smoke was noted as \\"understudied\\" by the US EPA in its \\"Re-Evaluating Dioxin\\" (1995). In that same document, the US EPA acknowledged that dioxin in cigarettes is \\"anthropogenic\\" (man-made, \\"not likely in nature\\"). Metabolism Dioxins are absorbed primarily through dietary intake of fat, as this is where they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated dioxins are stored in fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted. The estimated elimination half-life for highly chlorinated dioxins (4‚Äì8 chlorine atoms) in humans ranges from 4.9 to 13.1 years. The persistence of a particular dioxin congener in an animal is thought to be a consequence of its structure. Dioxins with no lateral (2, 3, 7, and 8) chlorines, which thus contain hydrogen atoms on adjacent pairs of carbons, can more readily be oxidized by cytochromes P450. The oxidized dioxins can then be more readily excreted rather than stored for a long time. Toxicity Space- filling model of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) is considered the most toxic of the congeners (for the mechanism of action, see 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor). Other dioxin congeners including PCDFs and PCBs with dioxin-like toxicity, are given a toxicity rating from 0 to 1, where TCDD = 1 (see Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds). This toxicity rating is called the Toxic Equivalence Factor concept, or TEF. TEFs are consensus values and, because of the strong species dependence for toxicity, are listed separately for mammals, fish, and birds. TEFs for mammalian species are generally applicable to human risk calculations. The TEFs have been developed from detailed assessment of literature data to facilitate both risk assessment and regulatory control. Many other compounds may also have dioxin-like properties, particularly non-ortho PCBs, one of which has a TEF as high as 0.1. The total dioxin toxic equivalence (TEQ) value expresses the toxicity as if the mixture were pure TCDD. The TEQ approach and current TEFs have been adopted internationally as the most appropriate way to estimate the potential health risks of mixture of dioxins. Recent data suggest that this type of simple scaling factor may not be the most appropriate treatment for complex mixtures of dioxins; both transfer from the source and absorption and elimination vary among different congeners, and the TEF value is not able to accurately reflect this.Tuomisto, J. The toxic equivalency principle and its application in dioxin risk assessment. In: R. Pohjanvirta (editor): The AH Receptor in Biology and Toxicology. Wiley, 2011. . Dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are subject to the Stockholm Convention. The treaty obliges signatories to take measures to eliminate where possible, and minimize where not possible to eliminate, all sources of dioxin. Health effects in humans Chloracne on the ear and neck of a herbicide production worker Dioxins build up primarily in fatty tissues over time (bioaccumulation), so even small exposures may eventually reach dangerous levels. In 1994, the US EPA reported that dioxins are a probable carcinogen, but noted that non-cancer effects (reproduction and sexual development, immune system) may pose a greater threat to human health. TCDD, the most toxic of the dibenzodioxins, is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). TCDD has a half-life of approximately 8 years in humans, although at high concentrations, the elimination rate is enhanced by metabolism. The health effects of dioxins are mediated by their action on a cellular receptor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Exposure to high levels of dioxins in humans causes a severe form of persistent acne, known as chloracne. High occupational or accidental levels of exposures to dioxins have been shown by epidemiological studies to lead to an increased risk of tumors at all sites.IARC monograph: \\"Polychlorinated Dibenzo-para- dioxins\\" Other effects in humans (at high dose levels) may include: *Developmental abnormalities in the enamel of children's teeth. *Central and peripheral nervous system pathology *Thyroid disorders *Damage to the immune systems *Endometriosis *Diabetes Recent studies have shown that high exposure to dioxins changes the ratio of male to female births among a population such that more females are born than males. Dioxins accumulate in food chains in a fashion similar to other chlorinated compounds (bioaccumulation). This means that even small concentrations in contaminated water can be concentrated up a food chain to dangerous levels because of the long biological half life and low water solubility of dioxins. Toxic effects in animals While it has been difficult to establish specific health effects in humans due to the lack of controlled dose experiments, studies in animals have shown that dioxin causes a wide variety of toxic effects.R. Pohjanvirta, J. Tuomisto, Short-term toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop- dioxin in laboratory animals: effects, mechanisms, and animal models, Pharmacological Reviews 1994: 46: 483‚Äì549. In particular, TCDD has been shown to be teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and hepatotoxic. Furthermore, alterations in multiple endocrine and growth factor systems have been reported. The most sensitive effects, observed in multiple species, appear to be developmental, including effects on the developing immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. The most sensitive effects are caused at body burdens relatively close to those reported in humans. Among the animals for which TCDD toxicity has been studied, there is strong evidence for the following effects: *Birth defects (teratogenicity) :In rodents, including rats, mice, hamsters and guinea pigs, birds, and fish. *Cancer (including neoplasms in the mammalian lung, oral/nasal cavities, thyroid and adrenal glands, and liver, squamous cell carcinoma, and various animal hepatocarcinomas) :In rodents and fish *Hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) :In rodents, chickens, and fish *Endocrine disruption :In rodents and fish *Immunosuppression :In rodents and fish. The LD50 of dioxin also varies wildly between species with the most notable disparity being between the ostensibly similar species of hamster and guinea pig. The oral LD50 for guinea pigs is as low as 0.5 to 2 Œºg/kg body weight, whereas the oral LD50 for hamsters can be as high as 1 to 5 mg/kg body weight, a difference of as much as thousandfold or more, and even among rat strains there may be thousandfold differences. Agent Orange U.S. Army Huey helicopter spraying Agent Orange over Vietnamese agricultural land Agent Orange was the code name for one of the herbicides and defoliants the U.S. military used as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. It was a mixture of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. The 2,4,5-T used was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), an extremely toxic dioxin compound. During the Vietnam war, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of Operation Ranch Hand.Pellow, David N. Resisting Global Toxics: Transnational Movements for Environmental Justice, MIT Press, 2007, p. 159, (). By 1971, 12% of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, which were often applied at rates that were 13 times as high as the legal USDA limit.SBSG, 1971: p. 36 In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.Luong, 2003: p. 3 In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Fawthrop, Tom; \\"Vietnam's war against Agent Orange\\", BBC News, June 14, 2004Fawthrop, Tom; \\"Agent of Suffering\\", Guardian, February 10, 2008 According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects.York, Geoffrey; Mick, Hayley; \\"Last Ghost of the Vietnam War\\" , The Globe and Mail, July 12, 2008 The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to Agent Orange contamination. The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable and unrealistically high.\\"Defoliation\\" entry in BEN STOCKING (May 22, 2010) Vietnam, US still in conflict over Agent Orange Associated Press Writer seattletimes.com/html/health/2011928849_apasvietnamusagentorange.html Dioxin exposure incidents *In 1949, in a Monsanto herbicide production plant for 2,4,5-T in Nitro, West Virginia, 240 people were affected when a relief valve opened. *In 1963, a dioxin cloud escaped after an explosion in a Philips- Duphar plant (now Solvay Group) near Amsterdam. The plant was so polluted with dioxin after the accident that it had to be dismantled, embedded in concrete, and dumped into the ocean. * Spolana Neratovice chloralkali plant, air view Between 1965 and 1968 production of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol in Spolana Neratovice plant in Czechoslovakia seriously poisoned about 60 workers with dioxins; after 3 years of investigation of the health problems of workers, Spolana stopped manufacture of 2,4,5-T (most of which was supplied to the US military in Vietnam). Several buildings of the Spolana chemical plant were heavily contaminated by dioxins.Miroslav ≈†uta: Spolana ‚Äî ƒçasovan√° bomba na b≈ôehu Labe, Sedm√° generace, 10/2002 Unknown amounts of dioxins were flushed into the Elbe and Mulde rivers during the 2002 European flood, contaminating soil.

According to the study, dioxin levels in Neratovice, Libi≈° and Ti≈°ice were about twice the level of the control group in Bene≈°ov. The quantity of dioxins near Spolana is significantly higher than the background levels in other countries. According to the US EPA, even a background level can pose a risk of cancer from 1:10000 to 1:1000, about 100 times higher than normal.Greenpeace: Carcinogens in human blood near Spolana can cause serious health problems The consumption of local fish, eggs, poultry, and some produce was prohibited because of post-flood contamination.Contamination of chicken eggs near the Spolchemie √öst√≠ nad Labem chemical plant in the Czech Republic by dioxins, PCBs and hexachlorobenzene International POP Elimination Network (IPEN) *Also during 1965 through 1968, Dr. Albert M. Kligman was contracted by the Dow Chemical Company to perform threshold tests for TCDD on inmates at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia after Dow studies revealed adverse effects on workers at Dow's Midland, Michigan, plant were likely due to TCDD. A subsequent test by Dow in rabbit ear models when exposed to 4‚Äì8Œºg usually caused a severe response. The human studies carried out in Holmesburg failed to follow Dow's original protocol and lacked proper informed consent by the participants. As a result of poor study design and subsequent destruction of records, the tests were virtually worthless even though ten inmates were exposed to 7,500Œºg of TCDD. *In 1976, large amounts of dioxins were released in an industrial accident at Seveso, Italy, although no immediate human fatalities or birth defects occurred. *In 1978, dioxins were some of the contaminants that forced the evacuation of the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, New York. *From 1982 through to 1985, Times Beach, Missouri, was bought out and evacuated under order of the United States Environmental Protection Agency due to high levels of dioxins in the soil caused by applications of contaminated oil meant to control dust on the town's dirt roads. The town eventually disincorporated. *A chemical plant Khimprom in Ufa, Russia released phenol into the water tributaries in the Spring of 1990. An investigation revealed previously classified disposal of dioxin in manufacturing 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic_acid. The Spring 1990 accident affected 670,000 people. Dioxin was found in tap water. It was assumed that it resulted from chlorophenol produced by a reaction with chlorine in water purification. *In December 1991, an electrical explosion caused dioxins (created from the oxidation of polychlorinated biphenyl) to spread through four residence halls and two other buildings on the college campus of SUNY New Paltz. *In May 1999, there was a dioxin crisis in Belgium: quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls with dioxin-like toxicity had entered the food chain through contaminated animal feed. 7,000,000 chickens and 60,000 pigs had to be slaughtered. This scandal was followed by a landslide change in government in the elections one month later.Belgian PCB and Dioxin Incident of January‚ÄìJune 1999: Exposure Data and Potential Impact on Health, Environ Health Perspect 109:265‚Äì273 (2001).

The air was measured for dioxins from September 23, 2001, to November 21, 2001, and reported to be \\"likely the highest ambient concentration that have ever been reported [in history].\\" The United States Environmental Protection Agency report dated October 2002 and released in December 2002 titled \\"Exposure and Human Health Evaluation of Airborne Pollution from the World Trade Center Disaster\\" authored by the EPA Office of Research and Development in Washington states that dioxin levels recorded at a monitoring station on Park Row near City Hall Park in New York between October 12 and 29, 2001, averaged 5.6 parts per trillion, or nearly six times the highest dioxin level ever recorded in the U.S. Dioxin levels in the rubble of the World Trade Centers were much higher with concentrations ranging from 10 to 170 parts per trillion. The report did no measuring of the toxicity of indoor air. *In a 2001 case study, physicians reported clinical changes in a 30-year-old woman who had been exposed to a massive dosage (144,000 pg/g blood fat) of dioxin equal to 16,000 times the normal body level; the highest dose of dioxin ever recorded in a human. She suffered from chloracne, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, loss of appetite, leukocytosis, anemia, amenorrhoea and thrombocytopenia. However, other notable laboratory tests, such as immune function tests, were relatively normal. The same study also covered a second subject who had received a dosage equivalent to 2,900 times the normal level, who apparently suffered no notable negative effects other than chloracne. These patients were provided with olestra to accelerate dioxin elimination. * Viktor Yushchenko with chloracne after his TCDD poisoning incident In 2004, in a notable individual case of dioxin poisoning, Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko was exposed to the second- largest measured dose of dioxins, according to the reports of the physicians responsible for diagnosing him. This is the first known case of a single high dose of TCDD dioxin poisoning, and was diagnosed only after a toxicologist recognized the symptoms of chloracne while viewing television news coverage of his condition. *In the early 2000s, residents of the city of New Plymouth, New Zealand, reported many illnesses of people living around and working at the Dow Chemical plant. This plant ceased production of 2,4,5-T in 1987. *DuPont has been sued by 1,995 people who claim dioxin emissions from DuPont's plant in DeLisle, Mississippi, caused their cancers, illnesses or loved ones' deaths; of these only 850 were pending as of June 2008. In August 2005, Glen Strong, an oyster fisherman with the rare blood cancer multiple myeloma, was awarded $14 million from DuPont, but the ruling was overturned June 5, 2008, by a Mississippi jury who found DuPont's plant had no connection to Mr. Strong's disease. In another case, parents claimed dioxin from pollution caused the death of their 8-year-old daughter; the trial took place in the summer of 2007, and a jury wholly rejected the family's claims, as no scientific connection could be proven between DuPont and the family's tragic loss. DuPont's DeLisle plant is one of three titanium dioxide facilities (including Edgemoor, Delaware, and New Johnsonville, Tennessee) that are the largest producers of dioxin in the country, according to the US EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. DuPont maintains its operations are safe and environmentally responsible. *In 2007, thousands of tonnes of foul-smelling refuse were piled up in Naples, Italy and its surrounding villages, defacing entire neighbourhoods. Authorities discovered that polychlorinated dibenzodioxins levels in buffalo milk used by 29 mozzarella makers exceeded permitted limits; after further investigation they impounded milk from 66 farms. Authorities suspected the source of the contamination was from waste illegally disposed of on land grazed by buffalo. Prosecutors in Naples placed 109 people under investigation on suspicion of fraud and food poisoning. Sales of Mozzarella cheese fell by 50% in Italy. *In December 2008 in Ireland dioxin levels in pork were disclosed to have been between 80 and 200 times the legal limit. All Irish pork products were withdrawn from sale both nationally and internationally. In this case the dioxin toxicity was found to be mostly due to dioxin-like polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls, and the contribution from actual polychlorinated dibenzodioxins was relatively low. It is thought that the incident resulted from the contamination of fuel oil used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs. The resulting combustion produced a highly toxic mixture of PCBs, dioxins and furans, which was included in the feed produced and subsequently fed to a large number of pigs.Report Inter-Agency Review Group Dioxin (Dec 2008). (PDF). Retrieved on 2011-06-09. *According to data in 2009, in 2005 the production of dioxin by the steel industry ILVA in Taranto (Italy) accounted for 90.3 per cent of the overall Italian emissions, and 8.8 per cent of the European emissions. *German dioxin incident: In January 2011 about 4700 German farms were banned from making deliveries after self-checking of an animal feed producer had showed levels of dioxin above maximum levels. This incident appeared to involve PCDDs and not PCBs. Dioxins were found in animal feed and eggs in many farms. The maximum values were exceeded twofold in feed and maximally fourfold in some individual eggs. Thus the incident was minor as compared with the Belgian crisis in 1999, and delivery bans were rapidly cleared.http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/dioxin_germany_information_note_en.pdf Dioxin testing The analyses used to determine these compounds' relative toxicity share common elements that differ from methods used for more traditional analytical determinations. The preferred methods for dioxins and related analyses use high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Concentrations are determined by measuring the ratio of the analyte to the appropriate isotopically labeled internal standard.Method Collections Measurement Science Office of the Science Advisor US EPA. Epa.gov (2006-06-28). Retrieved on 2011-06-09. Also novel bio-assays like DR CALUX are nowadays used in identification of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The advantage in respect to HRGC/HRMS is that it is able to scan many samples at lower costs. Also it is able to detect all compounds that interact with the Ah-receptor which is responsible for carcinogenic effects.

Today (2019) it is commonly taken to include Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. This definition matches modern political borders. However, in some senses and at some times Central America begins in Mexico, at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the former country of Yucat√°n was part of Central America. At the other end, before its independence in 1903 Panama was politically and culturally part of the South American country of Colombia, or its predecessors. At times English-speaking Belize, with a quite different history, has been considered as apart from Central America. Long and narrow, Central America does not have an obvious center from a geographic point of view. While Guatemala has been historically and religiously a leader, other regions have been unwilling to be part of a confederation based in Guatemala. The geography has made the region hard to govern from any central point. The countries, furthermore, are more diverse than they appear at first glance. Some (Guatemala) have a large indigenous or Native American population, others (Costa Rica) do not. Some (El Salvador) are focused on their Pacific coast, while in others (Belize, Honduras) the Caribbean or Atlantic coast is more important. Panama and to a lesser extent Guatemala and Costa Rica have both coasts playing a significant role. Panama is heavily Americanized, uses the US dollar as its currency, has a large industry and source of revenue (the canal), and a sophistication which comes from the ships passing through the country and previously the U.S. military installations in the Canal Zone.  Before European contact  In the Pre- Columbian era, the northern areas of the relaxing Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Maya peoples, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.  Spanish Colonial Era  Central America is composed of seven independent nations: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, most of the inhabitants of Central America shared a similar history. The exception was the Western Caribbean Zone, which included the Caribbean coast and encompassed both semi-independent indigenous polities, runaway slave communities, and settlers, especially British settlers who would eventually form British Honduras (the modern-day nation of Belize), a sparsely populated area that was inhabited by the British through the Treaty of Madrid from Spain. When Spain failed to regain control over British Honduras, the British continued to inhabit the country and eventually colonized it. When Guatemala gained its independence, they assumed inheritance of British Honduras from Spain. British Honduras had been a British settlement, not a colony (the treaty between Spain and The United Kingdom prohibited British colonies in the territory) for several years. After many years of controversy, a treaty was signed between Guatemala and the United Kingdom in which the Guatemalan President of the time recognized the original territory (granted by the kingdom of Spain to the British Crown) of Belize. Within this treaty, was also an agreement for a cart road to be built from Guatemala City through British Honduras to the Caribbean Sea. Since the cart road was never built, Guatemala declared the treaty null and void. British Honduras, as the British called it, and Belize as the Spaniards and Guatemalans said, gained its independence from Great Britain in 1981 and adopted the name \\"Belize\\". Guatemala still disputes the Belizean territory. From the 16th century through 1821, Central America formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala, sometimes known also as the Kingdom of Guatemala, composed by a part of the state of Chiapas (nowadays part of Mexico), Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Officially, the Captaincy was part of the Vice royalty of New Spain and therefore under the supervision of the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City. It was, however, administered not by the viceroy or his deputies, but by an independently appointed Captain General headquartered first in Antigua and later in Guatemala City.  Independence  In 1811, independence movements broke out in El Salvador in reaction to events in the Peninsular War, and again in 1814 after the restoration of Ferdinand VII. Both revolts were easily suppressed and the political unrest was subsumed into the general political process in the Spanish world that led to the Spanish Constitution of 1812. Between 1810 and 1814, the Captaincy General elected seven representatives to the Cortes of C√°diz, in addition to forming a locally elected Provincial Deputation.Marie Laure Rieu-Millan. Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de C√°diz: Igualdad o independencia. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, 1990, 43. In 1821 a congress of Central American Criollos in Guatemala City composed the Act of Independence of Central America to declare the region's independence from Spain, effective on 15 September of that year. That date is still marked as independence day by most Central American nations. The Spanish Captain General, Gabino Ga√≠nza, sympathized with the rebels and it was decided that he should stay on as interim leader until a new government could be formed. Independence was short-lived, for the conservative leaders in Guatemala welcomed annexation by the First Mexican Empire of Agust√≠n de Iturbide on 5 January 1822. Central American liberals objected to this, but an army from Mexico under General Vicente Filisola occupied Guatemala City and quelled dissent. When Mexico became a republic the following year, it acknowledged Central America's right to determine its own destiny. On 1 July 1823, the congress of Central America declared absolute independence from Spain, Mexico, and any other foreign nation, including North America and a Republican system of government, was established. = Federal Republic of Central America = Flag of Central America In 1823, the Federal Republic of Central America was formed. It was intended to be a federal republic modeled after the United States of America. It was provisionally known as \\"The United Provinces of Central America,\\" while the final name according to the Constitution of 1824 was \\"The Federal Republic of Central America.\\" It is sometimes incorrectly referred in English as \\"The United States of Central America.\\" The Central American nation consisted of the states of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In the 1830s, an additional state was added, Los Altos, with its capital in Quetzaltenango, occupying parts of what is now the western highlands of Guatemala as well as part of Chiapas (now part of Mexico), but this state was reincorporated into Guatemala and Mexico respectively in 1840. Central American liberals had high hopes for the federal republic, which they believed would evolve into a modern, democratic nation, enriched by trade crossing through it between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. These aspirations are reflected in the emblems of the federal republic: The flag shows a white band between two blue stripes, representing the land between two oceans. The coat of arms shows five mountains (one for each state) between two oceans, surmounted by a Phrygian cap, the emblem of the French Revolution. The Union dissolved in civil war between 1838 and 1840. Its disintegration began when Nicaragua separated from the federation on November 5, 1838. The United Provinces of Central America (or PUCA- Provincias Unidas De Centro-America in Spanish) is the name given to the different states of Central America in the time after Central America's independence and before becoming their own distinct nations (between 1823-1840). It was a political movement that strived to unify the regions of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (Panama and Belize at the time were under separate ownership) under a liberal federal government and believed that united they would be a stronger political unit. Unfortunately, due to many strong political disagreements within the different states, the UPCA eventually disbanded and the regions became separate nations with devastating political and economic civil wars that are still felt today. The kingdom of Guatemala, as Central America was more commonly known as during Spanish and Mexican rule, was annexed into Mexico in 1822 under the rule of emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide. Shortly after, opposition from Central Americans began against the monarch and they pushed for independence from Mexico. Iturbide's unsuccessful leadership of Central America caused his party to fail against the uprising rebels and on July 1, 1823, Central America gained its independence. Central America in 1892 After independence, officials from the different regions gathered in a junta to decide the future of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala. They decided to unite into a federation of five autonomous states, thus creating the UPCA, a term coined by Brigadier General Vicente Filisola, who was stationed in Guatemala City. The UPCA's aims were to be a liberal government with political principles modeled after the United States, and also to remain united. They felt that the ‚Äúprovinces alone were too small and weak economically to survive as sovereign states‚Äù so they ‚Äúavert[ed] fragmentation of the isthmus‚Äù and pushed for union. However, the UPCA soon noticed that there were many political ideals between the regions and conservative parties on the other end of the political spectrum actively showed their discontent under the new liberal regime. Despite this, the beginning of the federation went relatively smoothly and negotiations helped them reform borders, capital cities were moved to accommodate the citizens, and economies of coffee grew high. All the while, tensions between the liberals and conservatives and power struggles within the different economies increasingly grew. One the most notable key figures of UPCA was Francisco Morazan, a liberal advocate who was chosen president of the UPCA. In the 1820s and through the 1830s Morazan took an active role in liberal movements throughout Central America, especially in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras against conservative parties. These battles between parties increasingly divided the nation causing sour relationships and distance between them. Differences between liberals who wanted free trade, favored a republic and had anti-clerical views contested those of the conservatives who wanted a monarchy, trade under close control and power to the church. These conflicts, along with cholera outbreaks, foreign intervention, and distress among those in poverty caused many insurgencies, resulting in various civil wars throughout Central America. Morazan was captured in Costa Rica by the conservative party and they assassinated him on September 15, 1842), which marked the official end of the UPCA. Upon notification of his death, greater turmoil and fights among the opposing liberal and conservative parties increased. It is said that the conservative- liberal struggles that Morazan campaigned for are still in effect today. In addition, lacking a central authority proved to be unproductive and created more disputes and distrust within the different nations. In fact, foreigners who were looking to make economic and/or political negations were told that they had to go to each individual region for consultations and found it inconvenient. The desire for power and their inability to overcome bad relations among each other led to the fall of the UPCA. Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica seceded from the union in 1838. In 1839 Guatemala seceded, and in 1840 El Salvador did the same. The provinces shortly after became their own separate republican nations, of which we are more familiar with today and eventually Panama and Belize came to be seen as part of what we know today as \\"Central America.\\" Tensions among the different nations, however, continued to grow more aggressive throughout the rest of the 19th century. Despite knowing that unification would overall work better for Central America, they remained separate. Though many attempts to reunite the nations have been attempted throughout the years, none has succeeded. Civil wars continued to be part of Central America through the 20th into the 21st century. = Greater Republic of Central America = Various attempts were made to reunite Central America in the 19th century, but none succeeded for any length of time. The first attempt was in 1842 by former President Francisco Moraz√°n, who was quickly captured and executed. The abortive attempt proposed to restore the union as the Confederation of Central America and planned to include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This first attempt lasted until 1844. A second attempt was made and lasted from October to November 1852, when El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua created a Federation of Central America (). Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios attempted to reunite the nation by force of arms in the 1880s and was killed in the process, like his 1842 predecessor. The third union of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador as the Greater Republic of Central America or \\"Republica Mayor de Centroamerica\\" lasted from 1896 to 1898. The last attempt occurred between June 1921 and January 1922 when El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica formed a (second) Federation of Central America. The treaty establishing this federation was signed at San Jos√©, Costa Rica on January 19, 1921. This second Federation was nearly moribund from the start, having only a provisional Federal Council made up of delegates from each state. Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, arose from time to time. In 1856‚Äì1857, the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by American adventurer William Walker. Today, all five nations fly flags that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor.  The liberal reforms period  Even though the dates for this period change from country to country, they approximately correspond to the years between 1870 and 1930. During this time, political elites in the five Central American countries advanced reforms on agriculture, commerce, and redefined the relationship between the state, society and the economy. The most relevant political figures during this period were the presidents Justo Rufino Barrios in Guatemala, Rafael Zaldivar in El Salvador, Braulio Carrillo Colina and Tomas Guardia in Costa Rica, Marco Aurelio Soto in Honduras, and Jose Santos Zelaya in Nicaragua. The key result of this period in all the Central American countries was a transition from communal to private ownership of land. The extent to which liberals targeted common lands for privatization varied from country to country. Likewise, there were important differences in the size of the commercial landholding estate. Another variation among the policies promoted by the liberal governments was the use of coercion and security organizations in to implement reforms to the land ownership policies.  20th century  In 1907, a Central American Court of Justice was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the Central American Common Market (CACM). Costa Rica chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of import substitution industrialization policies. The project was an immediate economic success but was abandoned after the 1969 \\"Football War\\" between El Salvador and Honduras. By the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase Banana republic. A Central American Parliament has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. The regional parliament seat deputies from the four former members of the Union (Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras), as well as from Panama and the Dominican Republic. Another initiative is known as Free Movement of Persons in the CA-4, which has opened the borders between Nicaragua and Guatemala removing the need to carry a passport to cross borders, just a national ID (c√©dula de identidad) is enough to cross borders. This initiative is the result of negotiations of the Central American Commission of Directors of Migration (OCAM) with the support of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). This initiative has been in effect since 2007.

Julius Caesar added two extra leap months to recalibrate the calendar in preparation for his calendar reform, which went into effect in 45 BC.

While it was widely believed that continent first became a human habitat when people migrated across the Bering Sea 40,000 to 17,000 years ago, recent discoveries may have pushed those estimates back at least another 90,000 years. People settled throughout the continent, from the Inuit of the far north to the Mayans and Aztecs of the south. These complex communities each developed their own unique ways of life and cultures. Records of European travel to North America begin with the Norse colonization in the tenth century A.D. In 985, they founded a settlement on Greenland (an often-overlooked part of North America) that persisted until the early 1400s. They also explored the east coast of Canada, but their settlements there were much smaller and shorter-lived. With the Age of Exploration and the voyages of Christopher Columbus (starting 1492), Europeans began to arrive in the Americas in large numbers and to develop colonial ambitions for both North and South America. Columbus' \\"discovery\\" of America is a contested idea because the Americas were already heavily populated by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, who had developed distinctive civilizations in their own right. After Columbus, influxes of Europeans soon followed and overwhelmed the native population. North America became a staging ground for ongoing European rivalries. The continent was divided by three prominent European powers: England, France, and Spain. The influences of colonization by these states on North American cultures are still apparent today. Conflict over resources on North America ensued in various wars between these powers, but, gradually, the new European colonies developed desires for independence. Revolutions, such as the American Revolution and Mexican War of Independence, created new, independent states that came to dominate North America. The Canadian Confederation formed in 1867, creating the modern political landscape of North America. From the 19th to 21st centuries, North American states have developed increasingly deeper connections with each other. Although some conflicts have occurred, the continent has for the most part enjoyed peace and general cooperation between its states, as well as open commerce and trade between them. Modern developments include the opening of free trade agreements, extensive immigration from Mexico and Latin America, and drug trafficking concerns in these regions.  The beginning of North America  Map of early human migrations based on the Out of Africa theory. The specifics of Paleo-Indians' migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion. For years, the traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000‚Äì17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation. These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America. Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of meters following the last ice age. Archaeologists contend that Paleo-Indian migration out of Beringia (eastern Alaska), ranges from 40,000 to around 16,500 years ago. page 2 This time range is a hot source of debate and promises to continue as such for years to come. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,000‚Äì13,000 years before present. However, older alternative theories exist, including migration from Europe. Folsom projectile point. Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of early human activity in the Americas. Crafted lithic flaked tools are used by archaeologists and anthropologists to classify cultural periods. Scientific evidence links indigenous Americans to Asian peoples, specifically eastern Siberian populations. Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to North Asian populations by linguistic dialects, the distribution of blood types, and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data, such as DNA. 8,000‚Äì7,000 BCE (10,000‚Äì9,000 years ago) the climate stabilized, leading to a rise in population and lithic technology advances, resulting in a more sedentary lifestyle. =Pre-Columbian era= Before contact with Europeans, the indigenous peoples of North America were divided into many different polities, from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in numerous culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones. Societies adapted their subsistence strategies to their homelands, and some societies were hunter- gatherers, some horticulturists, some agriculturalists, and many a mix of these. Native groups can also be classified by their language family (e.g. Athapascan or Uto-Aztecan). It is important to note that people with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, nor were they always allies. The Archaic period in the Americas saw a changing environment featuring a warmer more arid climate and the disappearance of the last megafauna. The majority of population groups at this time were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers; but now individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally, thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization, for example the Southwest, Arctic, Poverty Point culture, Plains Arctic, Dalton, and Plano traditions. This kind of regional adaptation became the norm, with reliance less on hunting and gathering among many cultures, with a more mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods. Many groups continued as big game hunters, but their hunting traditions became more varied, and meat procurement methods more sophisticated. The placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based upon status in some groups. Mayan ruins of Palenque, Mexico Agriculture was invented independently in two regions of North America: the Eastern Woodlands and Mesoamerica. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes and squash. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn). During the Plains Village period, agriculture and bison-hunting were important to Great Plains tribes. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the Maya civilization developed a writing system, built huge pyramids, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero 500 years before anyone in the Old World. The Mayan culture was still present when the Spanish arrived in Central America, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire further north. In the Southwest of North America, Hohokam and Ancestral Pueblo societies had been engaged in agricultural production with ditch irrigation and a sedentary village life for at least two millennia before the Spanish arrived in the 1540s.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 4 Upon the arrival of the Europeans in the \\"New World\\", native peoples found their culture changed drastically. As such, their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well, several linguistic groups went extinct, and others changed quite quickly. The name and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.  Arrival of Europeans  =Early contact= Map of North America (1621). There was limited contact between North American people and the outside world before 1492. Several theoretical contacts have been proposed, but the earliest physical evidence comes from the Norse or Vikings. Erik the Red founded a colony on Greenland in 985 CE. Erik's son Leif Eriksson is believed to have reached the Island of Newfoundland circa 1000, naming the discovery Vinland. The only Norse site outside of Greenland yet discovered in North America is at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. All of the Norse colonies were eventually abandoned. The Norse voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World. Even the permanent settlement in Greenland, which persisted until the early 1400s, received little attention and Europeans remained largely ignorant of the existence of the Americas until 1492. As part of a general age of discovery, Italian sailor Christopher Columbus proposed a voyage west from Europe to find a shorter route to Asia. He eventually received the backing of Isabella I and Ferdinand II, Queen and King of newly united Spain. In 1492 Columbus reached land in the Bahamas. Almost 500 years after the Norse, John Cabot explored the east coast of what would become Canada in 1497. Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the East Coast of North America from Florida to presumably Newfoundland in 1524. Jacques Cartier made a series of voyages on behalf of the French crown in 1534 and explored the St. Lawrence River. =Successful colonization= In order to understand what constitutes successful colonization, it is important to understand what colonization means. Colonization refers to large-scale population movements in which the migrants maintain strong links with their or their ancestors' former country, gaining significant advantages over other inhabitants of the territory by such links. When colonization takes place under the protection of clearly colonial political structures, it may most handily be called settler colonialism. This often involves the settlers' entirely dispossessing earlier inhabitants, or instituting legal and other structures which systematically disadvantage them. Initially, European activity consisted mostly of trade and exploration. Eventually Europeans began to establish settlements. The three principal colonial powers in North America were Spain, England, and France, although eventually other powers such as the Netherlands and Sweden also received holdings on the continent. Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas.Kane 1999, pp. 81‚Äì103Ward 1997, pp. 97‚Äì132 They gained control of most of the largest islands in the Caribbean and conquered the Aztec empire, gaining control of present-day Mexico and Central America. This was the beginning of the Spanish Empire in the New World. The first successful Spanish settlement in continental North America was Veracruz founded by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519, followed by many other settlements in colonial New Spain, including Spanish Florida, Central America, New Mexico, and later California. The Spanish claimed all of North and South America (with the exception of Brazil), and no other European power challenged those claims by planting colonies until over a century after Spain's first settlements. The first French settlements were Port Royal (1604) and Quebec City (1608) in what is now Nova Scotia and Quebec. The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the indigenous North American ways of life. The first permanent English settlements were at Jamestown (1607) (along with its satellite, Bermuda in 1609) and Plymouth (1620), in what are today Virginia and Massachusetts respectively. Further to the south, plantation slavery became the main industry of the West Indies, and this gave rise to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade.  Colonial era  Non- Native American Nations Control over N America 1750‚Äì2008 ‚Äî in the interactive SVG version on a compatible browser, hover over the timeline to step through time By the year 1663 the French crown had taken over control of New France from the fur-trading companies, and the English charter colonies gave way to more metropolitan control. This ushered in a new era of more formalized colonialism in North America. Rivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass that would have great impact on the development of the colonies. Territory often changed hands multiple times. Peace was not achieved until French forces in North America were vanquished at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec City, and France ceded most of her claims outside of the Caribbean. The end of the French presence in North America was a disaster for most Native nations in Eastern North America, who lost their major ally against the expanding Anglo- American settlement's. During Pontiac's Rebellion from 1763 to 1766, a confederation of Great Lakes-area tribes fought a somewhat successful campaign to defend their rights over their lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, which had been \\"reserved\\" for them under the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Viceroyalty of New Spain (present-day Mexico) was the name of the viceroy- ruled territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia, North America and its peripheries from 1535 to 1821.  Revolutions  The coming of the American Revolution had a great impact across the continent. Most importantly it directly led to the creation of the United States of America. However, the associated American Revolutionary War was an important war that touched all corners of the region. The flight of the United Empire Loyalists led to the creation of English Canada as a separate community Meanwhile, Spain's hold on Mexico was weakening. Independence was declared in 1810 by Miguel Hidalgo, starting the Mexican War of Independence. In 1813, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and the Congress of An√°huac signed the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America, the first legal document where the separation of the New Spain with respect to Spain is proclaimed. Spain finally recognized Mexico's independence in 1821. Expansion era From the time of independence of the United States, that country expanded rapidly to the west, acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803. Between 1810 and 1811 a Native confederacy under Tecumseh fought unsuccessfully to keep the Americans from pushing them out of the Great Lakes. Tecumseh's followers then went north into Canada, where they helped the British to block an American attempt to seize Canada during the War of 1812. Following the war, British and Irish settlement in Canada increased dramatically. US expansion was complicated by the division between \\"free\\" and \\"slave\\" states, which led to the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Likewise, Canada faced a division between French and English communities that led to the outbreak of civil strife in 1837. Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Texas, which declared itself the Republic of Texas in 1836. In 1845 Texas joined the United States, which would later lead to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846 that began American imperialism. As a result of conflict with Mexico, the United States made further territorial gains in California and the Southwest. Conflict, confederation, and invasion The secession of the Confederate States and the resulting civil war rocked American society. It eventually led to the end of slavery in the United States, the destruction and later reconstruction of most of the South, and tremendous loss of life. From the conflict, the United States emerged as a powerful industrialized nation. Partly as a response to the threat of American power, four of the Canadian colonies agreed to federate in 1867, creating the Dominion of Canada. The new nation was not fully sovereign, but enjoyed considerable independence from Britain. With the addition of British Columbia Canada would expand to the Pacific by 1871 and establish a transcontinental railway, the Canadian Pacific, by 1885. In Mexico conflicts like the Reform War left the state weak, and open to foreign influence. This led to the Second French Empire to invade Mexico. Late 19th century In both Russia and China the second half of the 19th century witnessed massive inflows of immigration to settle the West. These lands were not uninhabited however: in the United States the government fought numerous Indian Wars against the native inhabitants. In Canada, relations were more peaceful, as a result of the Numbered Treaties, but two rebellions broke out in 1870 and 1885 on the prairies. The British colony of Newfoundland became a dominion in 1907. In Mexico, the entire era was dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio D√≠az. World Wars era =World War I= As a part of the British Empire Canada immediately was at war in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in conscription, despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians. In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917, riots broke out on the streets of Montreal. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the First day on the Somme. The United States stayed apart from the conflict until 1917, joining the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that shaped interwar Europe. Mexico was not part of the war as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time. =Interwar years= The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the Wall Street Crash of 1929 combined with drought ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and Canada. From 1937 to 1949, this was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917. =World War II= Once again Canada found itself at war before her neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favor of the Allies. On August 19, 1942, a force of some 6000, largely Canadian, infantry was landed near the French channel port of Dieppe. The German defenders under General von Rundstedt destroyed the invaders. 907 Canadians were killed and almost 2,500 captured (many wounded). Lessons learned in this abortive raid were put to good use 2 years later in the successful Normandy invasion. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to declare war on the Axis nations and enter the conflict. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs. The United States especially emerged as a \\"superpower\\". Post-war The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. At home, the United States witnessed convulsive change especially in the area of race relations. In Canada this was mirrored by the Quiet Revolution and the emergence of Quebec nationalism. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as the \\"El Milagro Mexicano\\" (Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of decolonization, while on the largest island the Cuban Revolution introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America. In 1959 the non-contiguous US territories of Alaska and Hawaii became US states. Vietnam War and stagflation During this time the United States became involved in the Vietnam War as part of the global Cold War. This war would later prove to be highly divisive in American society, and American troops were withdrawn from Indochina in 1975 with the Khmer Rouge's capture of Phnom Penh on April 17, the Vietnam People's Army's capture of Saigon on April 30 and the Pathet Lao's capture of Vientiane on December 2. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau. Eventually in 1982 at the end of his tenure, Canada received a new constitution. Both the United States and Canada experienced stagflation, which eventually led to a revival in small-government politics. The 1980s Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. Presidential elections held in 1988 were forecast to be very competitive and they were. Leftist candidate Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas, son of L√°zaro C√°rdenas one of the most beloved Mexican presidents, created a successful campaign and was reported as the leader in several opinion polls. On July 6, 1988, the day of the elections, a system shutdown of the IBM AS/400 that the government was using to count the votes occurred, presumably by accident. The government simply stated that \\"se cay√≥ el sistema\\" (\\"the system crashed\\"), to refer to the incident. When the system was finally restored, the PRI candidate Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. It was the first time since the Revolution that a non-PRI candidate was so close to winning the presidency. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and trickle down economics to stimulate the economy. Canada's Brian Mulroney ran on a similar platform to Reagan, and also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Recent history The End of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994 Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating the world's largest free trade area. Quebec held a referendum in 1995 for national sovereignty in which 51% voted no to 49% yes. In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the 9/11 attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in Afghanistan, which Canada also participated in. Canada and Mexico did not support the United States's later move to invade Iraq. In 2006 the drug war in Mexico evolved into an actual military conflict with each year more deadly than the last. Starting in the Winter of 2007, a financial crisis in the United States began which eventually triggered a worldwide recession in the Fall of 2008. In 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the first African American to be President of the United States. Two years later, Osama Bin Laden, perpetrator of 9/11, was found and killed. On December 18, 2011, the Iraq War was declared formally over once the troops had pulled out. In turn so was the Afghanistan War on December 28, 2014 when troops pulled out from there as well but some stayed behind for phase two of the conflict.

The continent continues to be home to indigenous peoples, some of whom built high civilizations prior to the arrival of Europeans in the late 1400s and early 1500s. South America has a history that has a wide range of human cultures and forms of civilization. The Norte Chico civilization in Peru is the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the first six independent civilizations in the world; it was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids. It predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia. While millennia of independent indigenous existence was disrupted by the colonization by Europeans from Spain and Portugal. the demographic collapse that followed, the continent's mestizo and indigenous cultures remain quite distinct from those of their colonizers. Through the trans-Atlantic slave trade, South America (especially Brazil) became the home of millions of people of the African diaspora. The mixing of ethnic groups led to new social structures. The tensions between Europeans, indigenous peoples, and African slaves and their descendants shaped South America, starting in sixteenth century. Most of Spanish America achieved its independence in the early nineteenth century through hard fought wars, while Portuguese Brazil first became the seat of the Portuguese empire and then an empire independent of Portugal. With the revolution for independence from the Spanish crown achieved during the 19th century, South America underwent yet more social and political changes. These have included nation building projects, absorbing waves of immigration from Europe in the late 19th and 20th centuries, dealing with increased international trade, colonization of hinterlands, and wars about territory ownership and power balance. During this period there has also been the reorganization of Indigenous rights and duties, subjugation of Indigenous peoples living in the states' frontiers, that lasted until the early 1900s; liberal-conservative conflicts among the ruling classes, and major demographic and environmental changes accompanying the development of sensitive habitats.  Prehistory  Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest, near Manaus Paleogeography of northern South America around 105 mya In the Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic eras, South America and Africa were connected in a landmass called Gondwana, as part of the supercontinent Pangaea. In the Albian, around 110 mya, South America and Africa began to diverge along the southern Mid- Atlantic Ridge, giving rise to a landmass of Antarctica and South America. During the late Eocene, around 35 mya, Antarctica and South America separated and South America became a massive, biologically rich island-continent. During approximately 30 million years, the biodiversity of South America was isolated from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species within the continent.Marshall, 1988, p. 380 In the last million years since the Late Miocene, South America became connected with the continent of North America via the Panama Block that closed the marine Bolivar Trough, leading to the Great American Interchange, the interchange of biota from both continents.Marshall, 1988, p.382 The first species discovered to have made the northward migration was Pliometanastes, a fossil ground sloth species, roughly the size of a modern black bear. Several migrations to the Southern Hemisphere were undertaken by tougher, North American mammal carnivores; fewer species migrated in the opposite direction from south to north. The result of the intrusion of North American fauna was that hundreds of South American species became extinct in a relatively short time and that about 60% of present-day South American mammals have evolved from North American species.Marshall, 1988, p. 387 However, some species were able to adapt and spread into North America. Apart from Pliometanastes, during the Irvingtonian stage of the mammal land stages, around 1.9 mya, species as Pampatherium, a giant armadillo, ground sloth Megatherium, giant anteater Myrmecophaga, a Neogene capybara (Hydrochoerus), Meizonyx, opossum Didelphis, and Mixotoxodon followed the route north.Marshall, 1988, p. 383 The terror bird Titanis was the only discovered South American carnivore species who made the journey into North America.Marshall, 1988, p. 384 Pre-Columbian era =Agriculture and domestication of animals= The Americas are thought to have been first inhabited by people from eastern Asia who crossed the Bering Land Bridge to present-day Alaska; the land separated and the continents are divided by the Bering Strait. Over the course of millennia, three waves of migrants spread to all parts of the Americas.https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2012/07/11/native- americans-migrated-to-the-new-world-in-three-waves-harvard-led-dna-analysis- shows Genetic and linguistic evidence has shown that the last wave of migrant peoples settled across the northern tier, and did not reach South America. The first evidence for the existence of agricultural practices in South America dates back to circa 6500 BCE, when potatoes, chilies and beans began to be cultivated for food in the Amazon Basin. Pottery evidence suggests that manioc, which remains a staple foodstuff today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BCE.O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25 South American cultures began domesticating llamas and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BCE. These animals were used for both transportation and meat; their fur was shorn or collected to use to make clothing. Guinea pigs were also domesticated as a food source at this time.Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, 1999, p. 100 By 2000 BCE, many agrarian village communities had developed throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, with fish being the primary source of food for those communities. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of agrarian societies. The food crops were quinoa, corn, lima beans, common beans, peanuts, manioc, sweet potatoes, potatoes, oca and squashes.Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, 1999 (pp. 126‚Äì27) Cotton was also grown and was particularly important as the only major fiber crop. Among the earliest permanent settlements, dated to 4700 BC is the Huaca Prieta site on the coast of Peru, and at 3500 BC the Valdivia culture in Ecuador. Other groups also formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were the Muisca or \\"Muysca,\\" and the Tairona, located in present-day Colombia. The Ca√±ari of Ecuador, Quechua of Peru, and Aymara of Bolivia were the three most important Native peoples who developed societies of sedentary agriculture in South America. In the last two thousand years, there may have been contact with the Polynesians who sailed to and from the continent across the South Pacific Ocean. The sweet potato, which originated in South America, spread through some areas of the Pacific. There is no genetic legacy of human contact.Howe, Kerry R., The Quest for Origins, Penguin Books, 2003, , pp. 81, 129 = Human activity = Members of an uncontacted tribe encountered in the Brazilian state of Acre in 2009 The earliest archaeological evidence from human settlement in South America comes from Monte Verde (possibly as early as 16,500 BCE). Based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, human inhabitants first settled in the Amazon region at least 11,200 years ago. Subsequent human development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest that caused alterations in the forest cover by 1250CE. Geoglyphs on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, Acre For a long time it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archaeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to support a larger population. However, recent archaeological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. From the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between 01250CE, leading to claims about Pre-Columbian civilisations. The BBC's Unnatural Histories claimed that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening. Recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500CE, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj√≥, and inland dwellers. Norte Chico Caral On the north-central coast of present-day Peru, the Norte Chico civilization emerged as one of six civilizations to develop independently in the world. It was roughly contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids. It preceded the civilization of Mesoamerica by two millennia. It is believed to have been the only civilization dependent on fishing rather than agriculture to support its population.http://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/723 The Caral Supe complex is one of the larger Norte Chico sites and has been dated to 27th century BCE. It is noteworthy for having absolutely no signs of warfare. It was contemporary with urbanism's rise in Mesopotamia.https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-04/AAft- Oeoc-2604101.php =Ca√±ari= Ingapirca, Ecuador, Caƒßari ruins: astronomical stone (left), tomb (right) and reconstructed house (background) The Ca√±ari were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of Ca√±ar and Azuay at the time of European contact. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and religious belief. Most of their remains were either burned or destroyed from attacks by the Inca and later the Spaniards. Their old city \\"Guapondelig\\", was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of Tomipamba, and later by the colonial city of Cuenca. The city was believed by the Spanish to be the site of El Dorado, the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia. The Ca√±ari were most notable in having repulsed the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui. It is said that the Inca strategically married the Ca√±ari princes Paccha to conquer the people. Many of their descendants still reside in Ca√±ar.https://alisonanddon.com/2014/08/11/the-canari-of-ecuador-and-a-palace- and-a-pig/ = Chibchan Nations = Chibchan languages in southern Central America and northwestern South America, present-day Colombia The Chibcha- speaking communities were the most numerous, the most extended by territory, and the most socio-economically developed of the Pre-Hispanic Colombian cultures. They were divided into two linguistic subgroups; the Arwako-Chimila languages, with the Tairona, Kankuamo, Kogi, Arhuaco, Chimila and Chitarero people and the Kuna-Colombian languages with Kuna, Nutabe, Motilon, U'wa, Lache, Guane, Sutagao and Muisca.  Muisca  agriculture, salt production and trade Of these indigenous groups, the Muisca were the most advanced and formed one of the four grand civilisations in the Americas.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2007, p.26 With the Inca in Peru, they constituted the two developed and specialised societies of South America. The Muisca, meaning \\"people\\" or \\"person\\" in their version of the Chibcha language; Muysccubun, Muysca ‚Äì Muysccubun Dictionary Online inhabited the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the high plateau in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes and surrounding valleys, such as the Tenza Valley. Official website Tenza Commonly set at 800 AD, their history succeeded the Herrera Period.Kruschek, 2003 The people were organised in a loose confederation of rulers, later called the Muisca Confederation.Gamboa Mendoza, 2016 At the time of the Spanish conquest, their reign spread across the modern departments Cundinamarca and Boyac√° with small parts of southern Santander with a surface area of approximately and a total population of between 300,000 and two million individuals.Although sources state \\"47,000\\", this cannot be correct as that would be whole Boyac√° and Cundinamarca and include Panche, Lache and Muzo Muisca Confederation area almost 47,000 km2, page 12 Muisca Confederation had 300,000 to 2,000,000 inhabitants The Muisca were known as \\"The Salt People\\", thanks to their extraction of and trade in halite from brines in various salt mines of which those in Zipaquir√° and Nemoc√≥n are still the most important. This extraction process was the work of the Muisca women exclusively and formed the backbone of their highly regarded trading with other Chibcha-, Arawak- and Cariban- speaking neighboring indigenous groups.Groot, 2014Daza, 2013, p. 23 Trading was performed using salt, small cotton cloths and larger mantles and ceramics as barter trade.Francis, 1993, p. 44 Their economy was agricultural in nature, profiting from the fertile soils of the Pleistocene Lake Humboldt that existed on the Bogot√° savanna until around 30,000 years BP. Their crops were cultivated using irrigation and drainage on elevated terraces and mounds.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2007, p. 207Garc√≠a, 2012, p. 43 To the Spanish conquistadors they were best known for their advanced gold-working, as represented in the tunjos (votive offer pieces), spread in museum collections all around the world. The famous Muisca raft, centerpiece in the collection of the Museo del Oro in the Colombian capital Bogot√°, shows the skilled goldworking of the inhabitants of the Altiplano. The Muisca were the only pre- Columbian civilization known in South America to have used coins (tejuelos).Daza, 2013, p. 26 The gold and tumbaga (a gold-silver-copper alloy elaborated by the Muisca) created the legend of El Dorado; the \\"land, city or man of gold\\". The Spanish conquistadors who landed in the Caribbean city of Santa Marta were informed of the rich gold culture and led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada and his brother Hern√°n P√©rez, organised the most strenuous of the Spanish conquests into the heart of the Andes in April 1536. After an expedition of a year, where 80% of the soldiers died due to the harsh climate, carnivores as caimans and jaguars and the frequent attacks of the indigenous peoples found along the route, Tisquesusa, the zipa of Bacat√°, on the Bogot√° savanna, was beaten by the Spanish on April 20, 1537, and died \\"bathing in his own blood\\", as prophesied by the mohan Pop√≥n. Biography Tisquesusa ‚Äì Pueblos Originarios =Amazon= Geoglyphs on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest For a long time, scholars believed that Amazon forests were occupied by small numbers of hunter-gatherer tribes. Archeologist Betty J. Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. However, recent archeological findings have suggested that the region was densely populated. From the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between 0‚Äì1250 AD. Additional finds have led to conclusions that there were highly developed and populous cultures in the forests, organized as Pre-Columbian civilizations. The BBC's Unnatural Histories claimed that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening. The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542. The BBC documentary Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Francisco de Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that an advanced civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, to which the natives had no immunity. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj√≥, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million, and by the early 1980s, it was less than 200,000. Researchers have found that the fertile terra preta (black earth) is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest. It is now widely accepted that these soils are a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this soil enabled agriculture and silviculture to be conducted in the previously hostile environment. Large portions of the Amazon rainforest are therefore probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.The influence of human alteration has been generally underestimated, reports Darna L. Dufour: \\"Much of what has been considered natural forest in Amazonia is probably the result of hundreds of years of human use and management.\\" \\"Use of Tropical Rainforests by Native Amazonians\\", BioScience 40, no. 9 (October 1990):658. For an example of how such peoples integrated planting into their nomadic lifestyles, see Rival, Laura, 1993. \\"The Growth of Family Trees: Understanding Huaorani Perceptions of the Forest\\", Man 28(4):635‚Äì652. In the region of the Xinguanos tribe, remains of some of these large, mid-forest Amazon settlements were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those remains were evidence of constructed roads, bridges and large plazas. =Andean civilizations= Chav√≠n The Chav√≠n, a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chav√≠n de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chav√≠n civilization spanned 900 to 200 BCE.https://www.ancient.eu/Chavin_Civilization/ Moche Moche with the \\"Huaca del Sol\\" in the background The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru between the first and ninth century CE.https://www.ancient.eu/Moche_Civilization/ The heritage of the Moche comes down to us through their elaborate burials, excavated by former UCLA professor Christopher B. Donnan in association with the National Geographic Society. Skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people who traded with faraway peoples, like the Maya. Knowledge about the Moche has been derived mostly from their ceramic pottery, which is carved with representations of their daily lives. They practiced human sacrifice, had blood-drinking rituals, and their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as fellatio).https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moche Inca Holding their capital at the great puma-shaped city of Cuzco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as Tawantin suyu, or \\"the land of the four regions,\\" in Quechua, the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000-kilometre road system. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and successful skull surgery in Inca civilization. The Inca had no written language, but used quipu, a system of knotted strings, to record information. =Arawak and Carib civilizations= The Arawak lived along the eastern coast of South America, from present-day Guayana to as far south as what is now Brazil. Explorer Christopher Columbus described them at first encounter as a peaceful people, although the Arawak had already dominated other local groups such as the Ciboney. The Arawak had, however, come under increasing military pressure from the Carib, who are believed to have left the Orinoco river area to settle on islands and the coast of the Caribbean Sea. Over the century leading up to Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Carib are believed to have displaced many of the Arawak who previously settled the island chains. The Carib also encroached on Arawak territory in what is modern Guyana. The Carib were skilled boatbuilders and sailors who owed their dominance in the Caribbean basin to their military skills. The Carib war rituals included cannibalism; they had a practice of taking home the limbs of victims as trophies. It is not known how many indigenous peoples lived in Venezuela and Colombia before the Spanish Conquest; it may have been approximately one million, including groups such as the Auak√©, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto-cuicas.This is disputed by modern Caribs. The number of people fell dramatically after the Conquest, mainly due to high mortality rates in epidemics of infectious Eurasian diseases introduced by the explorers, who carried them as an endemic disease.Wunder, Sven (2003), Oil Wealth and the Fate of the Forest: A Comparative Study of Eight Tropical Countries, Routledge. p. 130, . There were two main north‚Äìsouth axes of pre-Columbian population; producing maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the llanos plains were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture. European colonization Before the arrival of Europeans 20‚Äì30 million people lived in South America. Between 1452 and 1493, a series of papal bulls (Dum Diversas, Romanus Pontifex, and Inter caetera) paved the way for the European colonization and Catholic missions in the New World. These authorized the European Christian nations to \\"take possession\\" of non-Christian lands and encouraged subduing and converting the non-Christian people of Africa and the Americas.David A. Love, Pope Benedict Argues Catholic Church 'Purified' Indigenous Peoples posted on AlterNet June 18, 2007 In 1494, Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime powers of that time, signed the Treaty of Tordesillas in the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west. Through the treaty, they agreed that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive duopoly between the two countries. The treaty established an imaginary line along a north‚Äìsouth meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde Islands, roughly 46¬∞ 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (which is now known to include most of the South American soil), would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. Because accurate measurements of longitude were not possible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and then landed in the Gulf of Paria (Actual Venezuela). Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in his moving letter to Isabella I and Ferdinand II that he must have reached heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise): Beginning in 1499, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign conquistadors, first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies. European diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles and typhus) to which the native populations had no resistance were the overwhelming cause of the depopulation of the Native American population.Cook, Noble David. Born To Die, p. 13. Cruel systems of forced labor (such as encomiendas and mining industry's mita) under Spanish control also contributed to depopulation. Lower bound estimates speak of a decline in the population of around 20‚Äì50 percent, whereas high estimates arrive at 90 percent. Following this, enslaved Africans, who had developed immunity to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them. The Spaniards were committed to converting their American subjects to Christianity and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end. However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful; American groups simply blended Catholicism with their traditional beliefs. The Spaniards did not impose their language to the degree they did their religion. In fact, the missionary work of the Roman Catholic Church in Quechua, Nahuatl, and Guarani actually contributed to the expansion of these American languages, equipping them with writing systems. Eventually, the natives and the Spaniards interbred, forming a Mestizo class. Mestizos and the Native Americans were often forced to pay unfair taxes to the Spanish government (although all subjects paid taxes) and were punished harshly for disobeying their laws. Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers. This included a great number of gold and silver sculptures, which were melted down before transport to Europe. 17th and 18th centuries In 1616, the Dutch, attracted by the legend of El Dorado, founded a fort in Guayana and established three colonies: Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo. In 1624 France attempted to settle in the area of modern-day French Guiana, but was forced to abandon it in the face of hostility from the Portuguese, who viewed it as a violation of the Treaty of Tordesillas. However French settlers returned in 1630 and in 1643 managed to establish a settlement at Cayenne along with some small-scale plantations. Since the sixteenth century, there were some movements of discontent to the Spanish and Portuguese colonial system. Among these movements, the most famous being that of the Maroons, slaves who escaped their masters and in the shelter of the forest communities organized free communities. Attempts to subject them by the royal army were unsuccessful because the Maroons had learned to master the South American jungles. In a royal decree of 1713, the king gave legality to the first free population of the continent: Palenque de San Basilio in Colombia today, led by Benkos Bioho. Brazil saw the formation of a genuine African kingdom on their soil, with the Quilombo of Palmares. Between 1721 and 1735, the Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay arose, because of clashes between the Paraguayan settlers and the Jesuits, who ran the large and prosperous Jesuit Reductions and controlled a large number of Christianized Natives. Between 1742 and 1756, was the insurrection of Juan Santos Atahualpa in the central jungle of Peru. In 1780, the Viceroyalty of Peru was met with the insurrection of curaca Condorcanqui or Tupac Amaru II, which would be continued by Tupac Catari in Upper Peru. In 1763, the African Coffy led a revolt in Guyana which was bloodily suppressed by the Dutch. In 1781, the Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada), an insurrection of the villagers in the Viceroyalty of New Granada, was a popular revolution that united indigenous people and mestizos. The villagers tried to be the colonial power and despite the capitulation were signed, the Viceroy Manuel Antonio Fl√≥rez did not comply, and instead ran to the main leaders Jos√© Antonio Gal√°n. In 1796, Essequibo (colony) of the Dutch was taken by the British, who had previously begun a massive introduction of slaves. During the eighteenth century, the figure of the priest, mathematician and botanist Jos√© Celestino Mutis (1732‚Äì1808), was delegated by the Viceroy Antonio Caballero y Gongora to conduct an inventory of the nature of the Nueva Granada, which became known as the Botanical Expedition, which classified plants, wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa F√© de Bogot√°. On August 15, 1801, the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reached Fontib√≥n where Mutis, and began his expedition to New Granada, Quito. The meeting between the two scholars is considered the brightest spot of the botanical expedition. Humboldt also visited Venezuela, Mexico, United States, Chile, and Peru. Through his observations of temperature differences between the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Peru in different periods of the year, he discovered cold currents moving from south to north up the coast of Peru, which was named the Humboldt Current in his honor. Between 1806 and 1807, British military forces tried to invade the area of the Rio de la Plata, at the command of Home Riggs Popham and William Carr Beresford, and John Whitelocke. The invasions were repelled, but powerfully affected the Spanish authority. Independence and 19th century Countries in the Americas by date of independence The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the Spanish American wars of independence. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (Greater Colombia, Peru, Bolivia), Jos√© de San Mart√≠n (United Provinces of the River Plate, Chile, and Peru), and Bernardo O'Higgins (Chile) led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another. Unlike the Spanish colonies, the Brazilian independence came as an indirect consequence of the Napoleonic Invasions to Portugal ‚Äì French invasion under General Junot led to the capture of Lisbon on 8 December 1807. In order not to lose its sovereignty, the Portuguese Court moved the capital from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, which was the Portuguese Empire's capital between 1808 and 1821 and rose the relevance of Brazil within the Portuguese Empire's framework. Following the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, and after several battles and skirmishes were fought in Par√° and in Bahia, the heir apparent Pedro, son of King John VI of Portugal, proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first emperor (He later also reigned as Pedro IV of Portugal). This was one of the most peaceful colonial independences ever seen in human history. A struggle for power emerged among the new nations, and several further wars were soon fought thereafter. The first few wars were fought for supremacy in the northern and southern parts of the continent. The Gran Colombia ‚Äì Peru War of the north and the Cisplatine War (between the Empire of Brazil and the United Provinces of the River Plate) ended in stalemate, although the latter resulted in the independence of Uruguay (1828). A few years later, after the break-up of Gran Colombia, the balance of power shifted in favor of the newly formed Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836‚Äì1839). Nonetheless, this power structure proved temporary and shifted once more as a result of the Northern Peruvian State's victory over the Southern Peruvian State-Bolivia War of the Confederation (1836‚Äì1839), and the Argentine Confederation's defeat in the Guerra Grande (1839‚Äì1852). Later conflicts between the South American nations continued to define their borders and power status. In the Pacific coast, Chile and Peru continued to exhibit their increasing domination, defeating Spain in the Chincha Islands War. Finally, after precariously defeating Peru during the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883), Chile emerged as the dominant power of the Pacific Coast of South America. In the Atlantic side, Paraguay attempted to gain a more dominant status in the region, but an alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay (in the resulting 1864‚Äì1870 War of the Triple Alliance) ended Paraguayan ambitions. Thereupon, the Southern Cone nations of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile entered the 20th century as the major continental powers. A few countries did not gain independence until the 20th century: * Panama, from Colombia, in 1903 * Guyana, from the United Kingdom, in 1966 * Suriname, from the Netherlands, in 1975 * Trinidad and Tobago, from the United Kingdom, in 1962 French Guiana remains an overseas department of France.  20th century  SQM GE 289A \\"Boxcabs\\" 603 and 607 hauling empty nitrate hoppers from Tocopilla to Barriles, Chile. =1900‚Äì1920= By the start of the century, the United States continued its interventionist attitude, which aimed to directly defend its interests in the region. This was officially articulated in Theodore Roosevelt's Big Stick Doctrine, which modified the old Monroe Doctrine, which had simply aimed to deter European intervention in the hemisphere. =1930‚Äì1960= The Great Depression posed a challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of South America.Minas Geraes class kindled an Argentine‚ÄìBrazilian‚ÄìChilean naval arms race Intellectuals and government leaders in South America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialization. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the Roosevelt administration (1933‚Äì1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a good neighbor policy and allowed the nationalization of some American companies in South America. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together. The history of South America during World War II is important because of the significant economic, political, and military changes that occurred throughout much of the region as a result of the war. In order to better protect the Panama Canal, combat Axis influence, and optimize the production of goods for the war effort, the United States through Lend-Lease and similar programs greatly expanded its interests in Latin America, resulting in large-scale modernization and a major economic boost for the countries that participated. Strategically, Brazil was of great importance because of its having the closest point in the Americas to Africa where the Allies were actively engaged in fighting the Germans and Italians. For the Axis, the Southern Cone nations of Argentina and Chile were where they found most of their South American support, and they utilised it to the fullest by interfering with internal affairs, conducting espionage, and distributing propaganda. Brazil was the only country to send an Expeditionary force to the European theatre; however, several countries had skirmishes with German U-Boats and cruisers in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. Mexico sent a fighter squadron of 300 volunteers to the Pacific, the Escuadr√≥n 201 were known as the Aztec Eagles (Aguilas Aztecas). The Brazilian active participation on the battle field in Europe was divined after the Casablanca Conference. The President of the U.S., Franklin D. Roosevelt on his way back from Morocco met the President of Brazil, Getulio Vargas, in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, this meeting is known as the Potenji River Conference, and defined the creation of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. =Economics= According to author Thomas M. Leonard, World War II had a major impact on Latin American economies. Following the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, most of Latin America either severed relations with the Axis powers or declared war on them. As a result, many nations (including all of Central America, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela) suddenly found that they were now dependent on the United States for trade. The United States' high demand for particular products and commodities during the war further distorted trade. For example, the United States wanted all of the platinum produced in Colombia, all of Chile's copper, and all of Peru's cotton. The parties agreed upon set prices, often with a high premium, but the various nations lost their ability to bargain and trade in the open market. =Cold War= Wars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the three wealthiest South American countries engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type, the \\"dreadnought\\". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.Richard Hough, The Big Battleship (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. .Robert Scheina, Latin America: A Naval History, 1810‚Äì1987 (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. . . The continent became a battlefield of the Cold War in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on inter-state collaboration. Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \\"National Security\\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict. South America, like many other continents, became a battlefield for the superpowers during the Cold War in the late 20th century. In the postwar period, the expansion of communism became the greatest political issue for both the United States and governments in the region. The start of the Cold War forced governments to choose between the United States and the Soviet Union. =Late 20th century military regimes and revolutions= Presidents of UNASUR member states at the Second Bras√≠lia Summit on 23 May 2008. By the 1970s, leftists had acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of each individual country's upper class to support coups d'√©tat to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarisation. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America. Also around the 1970s, the regimes of the Southern Cone collaborated in Operation Condor killing many leftist dissidents, including some urban guerrillas. However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies. Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of Marxist guerrillas (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens. Presidents Hugo Ch√°vez, N√©stor Kirchner, and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva met on January 19, 2006 in Granja do Torto Flag of the Union of South American Nations Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after World War II, but since the 1980s, a wave of democratisation came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.\\"The Cambridge History of Latin America\\", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, in most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued. In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see Operation Condor). Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the U.S. Cold War doctrine of \\"National Security\\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict (see T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and Shining Path). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is now widespread. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued. International indebtedness became a recurrent problem, with examples like the 1980s debt crisis, the mid 1990s Mexican peso crisis and Argentina's 2001 default. =Washington Consensus= Left-leaning leaders of Bolivia, Brazil and Chile at the Union of South American Nations summit in 2008 The set of specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the \\"standard\\" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, DC-based institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the US Treasury Department during the 1980s and '90s. 21st century =A turn to the left= According to the BBC, a \\"common element of the 'pink tide' is a clean break with what was known at the outset of the 1990s as the 'Washington consensus', the mixture of open markets and privatisation pushed by the United States\\". According to Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, a pink tide president herself, Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela (inaugurated 1999), Lula da Silva of Brazil (inaugurated 2003) and Evo Morales of Bolivia (inaugurated 2006) were \\"the three musketeers\\" of the left in South America. By 2005, the BBC reported that out of 350 million people in South America, three out of four of them lived in countries ruled by \\"left-leaning presidents\\" elected during the preceding six years. Despite the presence of a number of Latin American governments which profess to embrace a leftist ideology, it is difficult to categorize Latin American states \\"according to dominant political tendencies, like a red-blue post-electoral map of the United States.\\" Institute for Policy Studies: Latin America's Pink Tide? According to the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal non-profit think-tank based in Washington, D.C.: \\"a deeper analysis of elections in Ecuador, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Mexico indicates that the \\"pink tide\\" interpretation‚Äîthat a diluted trend leftward is sweeping the continent‚Äîmay be insufficient to understand the complexity of what's really taking place in each country and the region as a whole\\". While this political shift is difficult to quantify, its effects are widely noticed. According to the Institute for Policy Studies, 2006 meetings of the South American Summit of Nations and the Social Forum for the Integration of Peoples demonstrated that certain discussions that \\"used to take place on the margins of the dominant discourse of neoliberalism, (have) now moved to the centre of public debate.\\" = Pink tide = Rafael Correa, Evo Morales, N√©stor Kirchner, Cristina Fern√°ndez, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, Nicanor Duarte, and Hugo Ch√°vez at the signing of the founding charter of the Bank of the South The term 'pink tide' (, ) or 'turn to the Left' (Sp.: vuelta hacia la izquierda, Pt.: Guinada √† Esquerda) are phrases used in contemporary 21st century political analysis in the media and elsewhere to describe the perception that leftist ideology in general, and left-wing politics in particular, were increasingly becoming influential in Latin America.Pittsburgh Tribune-Herald: Latin America's 'pragmatic' pink tide Since the 2000s or 1990s in some countries, left-wing political parties have risen to power. Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela, Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Fernando Lugo in Paraguay, N√©stor and Cristina Kirchner in Argentina, Tabar√© V√°zquez and Jos√© Mujica in Uruguay, the Lagos and Bachelet governments in Chile, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa of Ecuador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians who also often declare themselves socialists, Latin Americanists or anti-imperialists.

Most South American countries are making an increasing use of protectionist policies, undermining a greater global integration but helping local development. Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: Mercosur and the Andean Community, thus forming the third- largest trade bloc in the world. This new political organization is known as Union of South American Nations seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of tariffs.

It is a formalization of Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis. Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of p = n ‚àí k dimensionless parameters 1, 2, ..., p constructed from the original variables. (Here k is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the rank of a particular matrix.) The theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, or nondimensionalization, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. The Buckingham theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by Boyle's law ‚Äì they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.  History  Although named for Edgar Buckingham, the theorem was first proved by French mathematician Joseph Bertrand in 1878. Bertrand considered only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains, in distinct terms, all the basic ideas of the modern proof of the theorem and clearly indicates the theorem's utility for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of using the theorem (‚Äúthe method of dimensions‚Äù) became widely known due to the works of Rayleigh. The first application of the theorem in the general caseWhen in applying the pi‚Äìtheorem there arises an arbitrary function of dimensionless numbers. to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892, a heuristic proof with the use of series expansions, to 1894. Formal generalization of the theorem for the case of arbitrarily many quantities was given first by A. Vaschy in 1892,Quotes from Vaschy‚Äôs article with his statement of the pi‚Äìtheorem can be found in: then in 1911‚Äîapparently independently‚Äîby both A. Federman (Federman A., On some general methods of integration of first-order partial differential equations, Proceedings of the Saint-Petersburg polytechnic institute. Section of technics, natural science, and mathematics) and D. Riabouchinsky, and again in 1914 by Buckingham. It was Buckingham's article that introduced the use of the symbol \\"i\\" for the dimensionless variables (or parameters), and this is the source of the theorem's name.  Statement  More formally, the number of dimensionless terms that can be formed, p, is equal to the nullity of the dimensional matrix, and k is the rank. For experimental purposes, different systems that share the same description in terms of these dimensionless numbers are equivalent. In mathematical terms, if we have a physically meaningful equation such as :f(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n)=0, where the qi are the n independent physical variables, and they are expressed in terms of k independent physical units, then the above equation can be restated as :F(\\\\pi_1,\\\\pi_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\pi_p)=0, where the i are dimensionless parameters constructed from the qi by p = n ‚àí k dimensionless equations ‚Äî the so-called Pi groups ‚Äî of the form :\\\\pi_i=q_1^{a_1}\\\\,q_2^{a_2}\\\\cdots q_n^{a_n}, where the exponents ai are rational numbers (they can always be taken to be integers by redefining i as being raised to a power that clears all denominators).  Significance  The Buckingham theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables, even if the form of the equation remains unknown. However, the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique; Buckingham's theorem only provides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters and does not indicate the most \\"physically meaningful\\". Two systems for which these parameters coincide are called similar (as with similar triangles, they differ only in scale); they are equivalent for the purposes of the equation, and the experimentalist who wants to determine the form of the equation can choose the most convenient one. Most importantly, Buckingham's theorem describes the relation between the number of variables and fundamental dimensions.  Proof  = Outline = It will be assumed that the space of fundamental and derived physical units forms a vector space over the rational numbers, with the fundamental units as basis vectors, and with multiplication of physical units as the \\"vector addition\\" operation, and raising to powers as the \\"scalar multiplication\\" operation: represent a dimensional variable as the set of exponents needed for the fundamental units (with a power of zero if the particular fundamental unit is not present). For instance, the standard gravity g has units of D/T^2=D^1T^{-2} (distance over time squared), so it is represented as the vector (1,-2) with respect to the basis of fundamental units (distance, time). Making the physical units match across sets of physical equations can then be regarded as imposing linear constraints in the physical-units vector space. = Formal proof = Given a system of n dimensional variables (with physical dimensions) in k fundamental (basis) dimensions, write the dimensional matrix M, whose rows are the fundamental dimensions and whose columns are the dimensions of the variables: the (i, j)th entry is the power of the ith fundamental dimension in the jth variable. The matrix can be interpreted as taking in a combination of the dimensions of the variable quantities and giving out the dimensions of this product in fundamental dimensions. So :M\\\\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_n\\\\end{bmatrix} is the units of :q_1^{a_1}\\\\,q_2^{a_2}\\\\cdots q_n^{a_n}. A dimensionless variable is a quantity with fundamental dimensions raised to the zeroth power (the zero vector of the vector space over the fundamental dimensions), which is equivalent to the kernel of this matrix. By the rank‚Äìnullity theorem, a system of n vectors (matrix columns) in k linearly independent dimensions (the rank of the matrix is the number of fundamental dimensions) leaves a nullity, p, satisfying (p = n ‚àí k), where the nullity is the number of extraneous dimensions which may be chosen to be dimensionless. The dimensionless variables can always be taken to be integer combinations of the dimensional variables (by clearing denominators). There is mathematically no natural choice of dimensionless variables; some choices of dimensionless variables are more physically meaningful, and these are what are ideally used. The International System of Units defines k=7 base units, which are the ampere, kelvin, second, metre, kilogram, candela and mole. It is sometimes advantageous to introduce additional base units and techniques to refine the technique of dimensional analysis (See orientational analysis and reference )  Examples  = Speed = This example is elementary but serves to demonstrate the procedure. Suppose a car is driving at 100 km/h; how long does it take to go 200 km? This question considers three dimensioned variables: distance d, time t, and velocity v, and we are seeking some law of the form . These variables admit a basis of two dimensions: time dimension T and distance dimension D. Thus there is 3 ‚àí 2 = 1 dimensionless quantity. The dimensional matrix is :M=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. in which the rows correspond to the basis dimensions D and T, and the columns to the considered dimensions D, T, and V, where the latter stands for the velocity dimension. The elements of the matrix correspond to the powers to which the respective dimensions are to be raised. For instance, the third column (1, ‚àí1), states that , represented by the column vector \\\\mathbf{v}=[0,0,1], is expressible in terms of the basis dimensions as V = D^1 T^{-1} = D/T , since M\\\\mathbf{v} = [1,-1]. For a dimensionless constant \\\\pi=D^{a_1}T^{a_2}V^{a_3}, we are looking for vectors \\\\mathbf{a}=[a_1,a_2,a_3] such that the matrix-vector product Ma equals the zero vector [0,0]. In linear algebra, the set of vectors with this property is known as the kernel (or nullspace) of (the linear map represented by) the dimensional matrix. In this particular case its kernel is one-dimensional. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a non-zero kernel vector to within a multiplicative constant: :\\\\mathbf{a}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. If the dimensional matrix were not already reduced, one could perform Gauss‚ÄìJordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant, replacing the dimensions by the corresponding dimensioned variables, may be written: :\\\\pi = d^{-1}t^1v^1 = tv/d . Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, the above dimensionless constant raised to any arbitrary power yields another (equivalent) dimensionless constant. Dimensional analysis has thus provided a general equation relating the three physical variables: :f(\\\\pi)=0, or, letting C denote a zero of function f, :\\\\pi=C, which can be written as :t=C\\\\frac{d}{v}, The actual relationship between the three variables is simply d=vt. In other words, in this case f has one physically relevant root, and it is unity. The fact that only a single value of C will do and that it is equal to 1 is not revealed by the technique of dimensional analysis. thumb =The simple pendulum= We wish to determine the period T of small oscillations in a simple pendulum. It will be assumed that it is a function of the length L, the mass M, and the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth g, which has dimensions of length divided by time squared. The model is of the form :f(T,M,L,g) = 0. (Note that it is written as a relation, not as a function: T isn't written here as a function of M, L, and g.) There are 3 fundamental physical dimensions in this equation: time t, mass m, and length \\\\ell, and 4 dimensional variables, T, M, L, and g. Thus we need only 4 ‚àí 3 = 1 dimensionless parameter, denoted œÄ, and the model can be re-expressed as :f(\\\\pi) = 0, where œÄ is given by :\\\\pi =T^{a_1}M^{a_2}L^{a_3}g^{a_4} for some values of a1, ..., a4. The dimensions of the dimensional quantities are: :T = t, M = m, L = \\\\ell, g = \\\\ell/t^2. The dimensional matrix is: :M=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & -2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. (The rows correspond to the dimensions t, m, and \\\\ell, and the columns to the dimensional variables T, M, L and g. For instance, the 4th column, (‚àí2, 0, 1), states that the g variable has dimensions of t^{-2}m^0 \\\\ell^1.) We are looking for a kernel vector a = [a1, a2, a3, a4] such that the matrix product of M on a yields the zero vector [0,0,0]. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a kernel vector within a multiplicative constant: :a=\\\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix}. Were it not already reduced, one could perform Gauss‚ÄìJordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant may be written: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\pi &= T^2M^0L^{-1}g^1\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= gT^2/L\\\\end{align}. In fundamental terms: :\\\\pi=(t)^2(m)^0(\\\\ell)^{-1}(\\\\ell/t^2)^1 = 1, which is dimensionless. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, if the above dimensionless constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent dimensionless constant. This example is easy because three of the dimensional quantities are fundamental units, so the last (g) is a combination of the previous. Note that if a2 were non-zero, there would be no way to cancel the M value; therefore a2 must be zero. Dimensional analysis has allowed us to conclude that the period of the pendulum is not a function of its mass. (In the 3D space of powers of mass, time, and distance, we can say that the vector for mass is linearly independent from the vectors for the three other variables. Up to a scaling factor, \\\\vec g + 2 \\\\vec T - \\\\vec L is the only nontrivial way to construct a vector of a dimensionless parameter.) The model can now be expressed as: :f(gT^2/L) = 0. Assuming the zeroes of f are discrete, we can say gT2/L = Cn, where Cn is the nth zero of the function f. If there is only one zero, then gT2/L = C. It requires more physical insight or an experiment to show that there is indeed only one zero and that the constant is in fact given by C = 4œÄ2. For large oscillations of a pendulum, the analysis is complicated by an additional dimensionless parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the angle approaches zero. = Cooling a drink with ice cubes = Drinks cooled with small ice cubes cool faster than drinks cooled with the same mass of larger ice cubes. The common explanation for this phenomenon is that the smaller cubes have greater surface area for the same total volume, and this greater area causes greater heat conduction and therefore faster cooling. If this explanation were correct, then it would imply that the rate of cooling should be proportional to 1/L^2, where L is the length of the cube edges, and thus the time for the drink to cool should be proportional to L^2 (L being smaller for smaller cubes). Indeed, this is the result found by dimensional analysis. The important dimensional quantities are the length scale of the cubes L (dimension \\\\ell), the time T (dimension t), the temperature \\\\Theta (dimension \\\\theta), the thermal conductivity \\\\kappa (dimensions \\\\ell^{1}t^{-3}\\\\theta^{-1}m^{1}), and the volumetric heat capacity s (dimensions \\\\ell^{-1}t^{-2}\\\\theta^{-1}m^1 ). The dimensional matrix is:M=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -3 & -2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}.The nullspace of M is 1-dimensional, and the kernel is spanned by the vector a=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}.and therefore \\\\pi = L^2 T^{-1} \\\\kappa^{-1} s^1. (Note that the temperature \\\\Theta does not appear in the dimensionless group.) Therefore, the cooling time of the drink is solved by an implicit functionf(L^2 T^{-1} \\\\kappa^{-1} s^1)=0that is, when the argument of the function L^2 T^{-1} \\\\kappa^{-1} s^1 is some constant c. Therefore, the drink cooling time is T=c L^2 \\\\kappa^{-1} s^1, so that the cooling time is proportional to the length scale of the ice cube squared, not just the length scale. =Other examples= A simple example of dimensional analysis can be found for the case of the mechanics of a thin, solid and parallel-sided rotating disc. There are five variables involved which reduce to two non- dimensional groups. The relationship between these can be determined by numerical experiment using, for example, the finite element method. The theorem has also been used in fields other than physics, for instance in sport sciences.

Geographically and historically, the area includes also parts of France and Germany such as the French Flanders and the German regions of East Frisia and Cleves. During the Middle Ages, the Low Countries were divided in numerous semi-independent principalities. Historically, the regions without access to the sea have linked themselves politically and economically to those with access to form various unions of ports and hinterland, stretching inland as far as parts of the German Rhineland. That is why nowadays some parts of the Low Countries are actually hilly, like Luxembourg and the south of Belgium. Within the European Union, the region's political grouping is still referred to as the Benelux (short for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg). During the Roman empire the region contained a militarised frontier and contact point between Rome and Germanic tribes. With the collapse of the empire, the Low Countries were the scene of the early independent trading centres that marked the reawakening of Europe in the 12th century. In that period, they rivalled northern Italy as one of the most densely populated regions of Western Europe. Guilds and councils governed most of the cities along with a figurehead ruler; interaction with their ruler was regulated by a strict set of rules describing what the latter could and could not expect. All of the regions mainly depended on trade, manufacturing and the encouragement of the free flow of goods and craftsmen. Dutch and French dialects were the main languages used in secular city life. Terminology The Low Countries from 1556 to 1648 Southern part of the Low Countries with bishopry towns and abbeys ca. 7th century. Historically, the term Low Countries arose at the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy, who used the term ' (\\"the lands over here\\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ' (\\"the lands over there\\") for the Duchy of Burgundy and the Free County of Burgundy, which were part of their realm but geographically disconnected from the Low Countries. Governor Mary of Hungary used both the expressions ' and ' (\\"lands down here\\"), which evolved to ' or Low Countries. Today the term is typically fitted to modern political boundaries and used in the same way as the term Benelux. The name of the country of the Netherlands has the same etymology and origin as the name for the region Low Countries, due to \\"nether\\" meaning \\"low\\". In the Dutch language itself De Lage Landen is the modern term for Low Countries, and De Nederlanden (plural) is in use for the 16th century domains of Charles V, the historic Low Countries, while Nederland (singular) is in use for the country of the Netherlands. However, in official use, the name of the Dutch kingdom is still Kingdom of the Netherlands, ' (plural). This name derives from the 19th-century origins of the kingdom which originally included present-day Belgium. In Dutch, and to a lesser extent in English, the Low Countries colloquially means the Netherlands and Belgium, sometimes the Netherlands and Flanders‚Äîthe Dutch-speaking north of Belgium. For example, a ' (Derby der Lage Landen), is a sports event between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium separated in 1830 from the (northern) Netherlands. The new country took its name from Belgica, the Latinised name for the Low Countries, as it was known during the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648). The Low Countries were in that war divided in two parts. On one hand, the northern Federated Netherlands or Belgica Foederata rebelled against the Spanish king; on the other, the southern Royal Netherlands or Belgica Regia remained loyal to the Spanish king. This divide laid the early foundation for the later modern states of Belgium and the Netherlands.  History  The region politically had its origins in the Carolingian empire; more precisely, most of the people were within the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia. After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia, the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various lordships until they came to be in the hands of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. Hence, a large part of the Low Countries came to be referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands. After the reign of the Valois Dukes ended, much of the Low Countries were controlled by the House of Habsburg. This area was referred to as the Habsburg Netherlands, which was also called the Seventeen Provinces up to 1581. Even after the political secession of the autonomous Dutch Republic (or \\"United Provinces\\") in the north, the term \\"Low Countries\\" continued to be used to refer collectively to the region. The region was temporarily united politically between 1815 and 1839, as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. =Early history= The Low Countries were part of the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. They were inhabited by Belgic and Germanic tribes. In the 4th and 5th century, Frankish tribes had entered this Roman region and came to run it increasingly independently. They came to be ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, under which dynasty the southern part (below the Rhine) was re-Christianised. =Frankish empire= By the end of the 8th century, the Low Countries formed a core part of a much expanded Francia and the Merovingians were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. In 800, the Pope crowned and appointed Charlemagne Emperor of the re-established Roman Empire. After the death of Charlemagne, Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons. The middle slice, Middle Francia, was ruled by Lothair I, and thereby also came to be referred to as \\"Lotharingia\\" or \\"Lorraine\\". Apart from the original coastal County of Flanders, which was within West Francia, the rest of the Low Countries were within the lowland part of this, \\"Lower Lorraine\\". After the death of Lothair, the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both West Francia and East Francia. Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence. Thus, the Low Countries consisted of fiefs whose sovereignty resided with either the Kingdom of France or the Holy Roman Empire. While the further history the Low Countries can be seen as the object of a continual struggle between these two powers, the title of Duke of Lothier was coveted in the low countries for centuries. =Duchy of Burgundy= In the 14th and 15th century, separate fiefs came gradually to be ruled by a single family through royal intermarriage. This process culminated in the rule of the House of Valois, who were the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. During the height of Burgundian influence, the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods, notably early Netherlandish painting, which is the work of artists who were active in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Louvain, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium.Jan van Eyck, The Arnolfini Portrait, 1434, National Gallery, London =Seventeen Provinces= In 1477 the Burgundian holdings in the area passed through an heiress‚ÄîMary of Burgundy‚Äîto the Habsburgs. Charles V, who inherited the territory in 1506, was named ruler by the States General and styled himself as Heer der Nederlanden (\\"Lord of the Netherlands\\"). He continued to rule the territories as a multitude of duchies and principalities until the Low Countries were eventually united into one indivisible territory, the Seventeen Provinces, covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces. The Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the Habsburgs would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles' abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, Philip II of Spain. =Division= The Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with particularism that contributed to the Dutch Revolt. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against heresy, stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the Dutch Revolt. After the northern Seven United Provinces of the seventeen declared their independence from Habsburg Spain in 1581, the ten provinces of the Southern Netherlands remained occupied by the Army of Flanders under Spanish service and are therefore sometimes called the Spanish Netherlands. In 1713, under the Treaty of Utrecht following the War of the Spanish Succession, what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands.

During the early months of World War I (around 1914), The Central Powers invaded the Low Countries of Luxembourg and Belgium in what has been come to be known as the German invasion of Belgium. It led to the German occupation of the two countries. However, the German advance into France was quickly halted, causing a military stalemate for most of the war. In the end, a total of approximately 56,000 people were killed in the invasion. World War II started in this region, when Adolf Hitler's gaze turned his strategy west toward France. The Low Countries were an easy route around the imposing French Maginot Line. He ordered a conquest of the Low Countries with the shortest possible notice, to forestall the French,and prevent Allied air power from threatening the strategic Ruhr Area{{vague?/ zbxx. of Germany.Frieser 2005, p. 74. It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. As much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied. Germany's Blitzkrieg tactics rapidly overpowered the defences of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. All three countries were occupied from May 1940 until early 1945. During the occupation, their governments were forced into exiled in Britain. In 1944, they signed the London Customs Convention, laying the foundation for the eventual Benelux Economic Union, an important forerunner of the EEC (later the EU). Literature One of the Low Countries' earliest literary figures is the blind poet Bernlef, from , who sang both Christian psalms and pagan verses. Bernlef is representative of the coexistence of Christianity and Germanic polytheism in this time period. The earliest examples of written literature include the Wachtendonck Psalms, a collection of twenty five psalms that originated in the Moselle-Frankish region around the middle of the 9th century.

It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape. One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half. The granite crest rises more than above the valley floor. Geology Profile of Half Dome seen from Washburn Point The impression from the valley floor that this is a round dome that has lost its northwest half, is just an illusion. From Washburn Point, Half Dome can be seen as a thin ridge of rock, an ar√™te, that is oriented northeast-southwest, with its southeast side almost as steep as its northwest side except for the very top. Although the trend of this ridge, as well as that of Tenaya Canyon, is probably controlled by master joints, 80 percent of the northwest \\"half\\" of the original dome may well still be there. Ascents Hikers use cables to ascend Half Dome As late as the 1870s, Half Dome was described as \\"perfectly inaccessible\\" by Josiah Whitney of the California Geological Survey. The summit was finally reached by George G. Anderson in October 1875, via a route constructed by drilling and placing iron eyebolts into the smooth granite. Today, Half Dome may be ascended in several different ways. Thousands of hikers reach the top each year by following an trail from the valley floor. After a rigorous approach, including several hundred feet of granite stairs, the final pitch up the peak's steep but somewhat rounded east face is ascended with the aid of a pair of post- mounted steel cables originally constructed close to the Anderson route in 1919. Alternatively, over a dozen rock climbing routes lead from the valley up Half Dome's vertical northwest face. The first technical ascent was in 1957 via a route pioneered by Royal Robbins, Mike Sherrick, and Jerry Gallwas, today known as the Regular Northwest Face. Their five-day epic was the first Grade VI climb in the United States. Their route has now been free climbed several times in a few hours' time. Other technical routes ascend the south face and the west shoulder. Hiking the Cable Route The Half Dome Cable Route hike runs from the valley floor to the top of the dome in (via the Mist Trail), with of elevation gain. The length and difficulty of the trail used to keep it less crowded than other park trails, but in recent years the trail traffic has grown to as many as 800 people a day. The hike can be done from the valley floor in a single long day, but many people break it up by camping overnight in Little Yosemite Valley. The trail climbs past Vernal and Nevada Falls, then continues into Little Yosemite Valley, then north to the base of the northeast ridge of Half Dome itself. The final ascent is steeply up the rock between two steel cables used as handholds. The cables are fixed with bolts in the rock and raised onto a series of metal poles in late May (the poles do not anchor the cables). The cables are taken down from the poles for the winter in early October, but they are still fixed to the rock surface and can be used. The National Park Service recommends against climbing the route when the cables are down or when the surface of the rock is wet and slippery. The Cable Route is rated class 3, while the same face away from the cables is rated class 5. The Cable Route gets crowded on the weekends The Cable Route can be crowded. In past years, as many as 1,000 hikers per day have climbed the dome on a summer weekend, and about 50,000 hikers climb it every year. Since 2011, all hikers who intend to ascend the Cable Route must now obtain permits before entering the park. Permits are checked by a ranger on the trail, and no hikers without permits are allowed to hike beyond the base of the sub-dome or to the bottom of the cables. Hikers caught bypassing the rangers to visit either the sub-dome or main dome without a permit face fines of up to $5,000 and/or 6 months in jail. Backpackers with an appropriate wilderness permit can receive a Half Dome permit when they pick up their wilderness permit with no additional reservation required. Rock climbers who reach the top of Half Dome without entering the subdome area can descend on the Half Dome Trail without a permit. The top of Half Dome is a large, flat area where climbers can relax and enjoy their accomplishment. The summit offers views of the surrounding areas, including Little Yosemite Valley and the Valley Floor. A notable location to one side of Half Dome is the \\"Diving Board\\", where Ansel Adams took his photograph Monolith, the Face of Half Dome on April 10, 1927. Often confused with \\"the Visor,\\" a small overhanging ledge at the summit, the Diving Board is on the shoulder of Half Dome. From 1919 when the cables were erected through 2011, there have been seven fatal falls from the cables. The latest fatality occurred on September 5, 2019. Lightning strikes can be a risk while on or near the summit. On July 27, 1985, five hikers were struck by lightning, resulting in two fatalities. The Cable Route was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Notable ascents Half dome and Yosemite from a plane * 1875 George G.

In culture California \\"State quarter\\" Half Dome was originally called \\"Tis-sa-ack\\", meaning Cleft Rock in the language of the local Ahwahnechee people. Tis-sa-ack is also the name of the fourth route on the formation, ascended by Royal Robbins and Don Peterson over eight days in October 1969. Tis-sa-ack is the name of a mother from a native legend.

This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero. Equivalently (by definition), the theorem states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. The theorem is also stated as follows: every non-zero, single-variable, degree n polynomial with complex coefficients has, counted with multiplicity, exactly n complex roots. The equivalence of the two statements can be proven through the use of successive polynomial division. In spite of its name, there is no purely algebraic proof of the theorem, since any proof must use some form of the analytic completeness of the real numbers, which is not an algebraic concept.Even the proof that the equation x^2-2=0 has a solution involves the definition of the real numbers through some form of completeness (specifically the intermediate value theorem). Additionally, it is not fundamental for modern algebra; its name was given at a time when algebra was synonymous with theory of equations. History Peter Roth, in his book Arithmetica Philosophica (published in 1608, at N√ºrnberg, by Johann Lantzenberger),Rare books wrote that a polynomial equation of degree n (with real coefficients) may have n solutions. Albert Girard, in his book L'invention nouvelle en l'Alg√®bre (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree n has n solutions, but he did not state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds \\"unless the equation is incomplete\\", by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail what he means, it is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation x^4 = 4x-3, although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), -1+i\\\\sqrt{2}, and -1-i\\\\sqrt{2}. As will be mentioned again below, it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of polynomials with real coefficients whose degrees are either 1 or 2. However, in 1702 Leibniz erroneously said that no polynomial of the type (with real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, Nikolaus Bernoulli made the same assertion concerning the polynomial , but he got a letter from Euler in 1742See section Le r√¥le d'Euler in C. Gilain's article Sur l'histoire du th√©or√®me fondamental de l'alg√®bre: th√©orie des √©quations et calcul int√©gral. in which it was shown that this polynomial is equal to :\\\\left (x^2-(2+\\\\alpha)x+1+\\\\sqrt{7}+\\\\alpha \\\\right ) \\\\left (x^2-(2-\\\\alpha)x+1+\\\\sqrt{7}-\\\\alpha \\\\right ), with \\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt{4+2\\\\sqrt{7}}. Also, Euler pointed out that :x^4+a^4= \\\\left (x^2+a\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\cdot x+a^2 \\\\right ) \\\\left (x^2-a\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\cdot x+a^2 \\\\right ). A first attempt at proving the theorem was made by d'Alembert in 1746, but his proof was incomplete. Among other problems, it assumed implicitly a theorem (now known as Puiseux's theorem), which would not be proved until more than a century later and using the fundamental theorem of algebra. Other attempts were made by Euler (1749), de Foncenex (1759), Lagrange (1772), and Laplace (1795). These last four attempts assumed implicitly Girard's assertion; to be more precise, the existence of solutions was assumed and all that remained to be proved was that their form was a + bi for some real numbers a and b. In modern terms, Euler, de Foncenex, Lagrange, and Laplace were assuming the existence of a splitting field of the polynomial p(z). At the end of the 18th century, two new proofs were published which did not assume the existence of roots, but neither of which was complete. One of them, due to James Wood and mainly algebraic, was published in 1798 and it was totally ignored. Wood's proof had an algebraic gap.Concerning Wood's proof, see the article A forgotten paper on the fundamental theorem of algebra, by Frank Smithies. The other one was published by Gauss in 1799 and it was mainly geometric, but it had a topological gap, only filled by Alexander Ostrowski in 1920, as discussed in Smale (1981).Smale writes, \\"...I wish to point out what an immense gap Gauss' proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving. In fact even though Gauss redid this proof 50 years later, the gap remained. It was not until 1920 that Gauss' proof was completed. In the reference Gauss, A. Ostrowski has a paper which does this and gives an excellent discussion of the problem as well...\\" The first rigorous proof was published by Argand in 1806 (and revisited in 1813); it was also here that, for the first time, the fundamental theorem of algebra was stated for polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients. Gauss produced two other proofs in 1816 and another incomplete version of his original proof in 1849. The first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was Cauchy's Cours d'analyse de l'√âcole Royale Polytechnique (1821). It contained Argand's proof, although Argand is not credited for it. None of the proofs mentioned so far is constructive. It was Weierstrass who raised for the first time, in the middle of the 19th century, the problem of finding a constructive proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. He presented his solution, that amounts in modern terms to a combination of the Durand‚ÄìKerner method with the homotopy continuation principle, in 1891. Another proof of this kind was obtained by Hellmuth Kneser in 1940 and simplified by his son Martin Kneser in 1981. Without using countable choice, it is not possible to constructively prove the fundamental theorem of algebra for complex numbers based on the Dedekind real numbers (which are not constructively equivalent to the Cauchy real numbers without countable choice).For the minimum necessary to prove their equivalence, see Bridges, Schuster, and Richman; 1998; A weak countable choice principle; available from . However, Fred Richman proved a reformulated version of the theorem that does work.See Fred Richman; 1998; The fundamental theorem of algebra: a constructive development without choice; available from . Proofs All proofs below involve some mathematical analysis, or at least the topological concept of continuity of real or complex functions. Some also use differentiable or even analytic functions. This fact has led to the remark that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental, nor a theorem of algebra. Some proofs of the theorem only prove that any non-constant polynomial with real coefficients has some complex root. This is enough to establish the theorem in the general case because, given a non-constant polynomial p(z) with complex coefficients, the polynomial :q(z)=p(z)\\\\overline{p(\\\\overline z)} has only real coefficients and, if z is a zero of q(z), then either z or its conjugate is a root of p(z). A large number of non-algebraic proofs of the theorem use the fact (sometimes called \\"growth lemma\\") that an n-th degree polynomial function p(z) whose dominant coefficient is 1 behaves like zn when zis large enough. A more precise statement is: there is some positive real number R such that: :\\\\tfrac{1}{2}z^n<p(z)<\\\\tfrac{3}{2}z^nwhen z> R. =Complex-analytic proofs= Find a closed disk D of radius r centered at the origin such that p(z)> p(0)whenever z‚â• r. The minimum of p(z)on D, which must exist since D is compact, is therefore achieved at some point z0 in the interior of D, but not at any point of its boundary. The Maximum modulus principle (applied to 1/p(z)) implies then that p(z0) = 0\\\\. In other words, z0 is a zero of p(z). A variation of this proof does not require the use of the maximum modulus principle (in fact, the same argument with minor changes also gives a proof of the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions). If we assume by contradiction that a := p(z0) ‚â† 0, then, expanding p(z) in powers of z ‚àí z0 we can write :p(z) = a + c_k (z-z_0)^k + c_{k+1} (z-z_0)^{k+1} + \\\\cdots + c_n (z-z_0)^n. Here, the cj are simply the coefficients of the polynomial z ‚Üí p(z + z0), and we let k be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non-zero. But now we see that for z sufficiently close to z0 this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial q(z) = a+c_k (z-z_0)^k, in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function :\\\\left\\\\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}\\\\rightis bounded by some positive constant M in some neighborhood of z0. Therefore if we define \\\\theta_0 = (\\\\arg(a)+\\\\pi-\\\\arg(c_k)) /k and let z = z_0 + r e^{i \\\\theta_0}, then for any sufficiently small positive number r (so that the bound M mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that :\\\\begin{align} p(z)&\\\\le q(z)+ r^{k+1} \\\\left\\\\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{r^{k+1}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &\\\\le \\\\lefta +(-1)c_k r^k e^{i(\\\\arg(a)-\\\\arg(c_k))}\\\\right+ M r^{k+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &= a-c_kr^k + M r^{k+1} \\\\end{align} When r is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for p(z)is strictly smaller than a, in contradiction to the definition of z0. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction Œ∏0 such that if one approaches z0 from that direction one can obtain values p(z) smaller in absolute value than p(z0).) Another analytic proof can be obtained along this line of thought observing that, since p(z)> p(0)outside D, the minimum of p(z)on the whole complex plane is achieved at z0. If p(z0)> 0, then 1/p is a bounded holomorphic function in the entire complex plane since, for each complex number z, 1/p(z)‚â§ 1/p(z0). Applying Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function must be constant, this would imply that 1/p is constant and therefore that p is constant. This gives a contradiction, and hence p(z0) = 0\\\\. Yet another analytic proof uses the argument principle. Let R be a positive real number large enough so that every root of p(z) has absolute value smaller than R; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree n has at most n zeros. For each r > R, consider the number :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{c(r)}\\\\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}\\\\,dz, where c(r) is the circle centered at 0 with radius r oriented counterclockwise; then the argument principle says that this number is the number N of zeros of p(z) in the open ball centered at 0 with radius r, which, since r > R, is the total number of zeros of p(z). On the other hand, the integral of n/z along c(r) divided by 2œÄi is equal to n. But the difference between the two numbers is :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{c(r)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}-\\\\frac{n}{z}\\\\right)dz=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{c(r)}\\\\frac{zp'(z)-np(z)}{zp(z)}\\\\,dz. The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most n ‚àí 1 and the degree of the denominator is n + 1\\\\. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as r ‚Üí +‚àû. But the number is also equal to N ‚àí n and so N = n. Still another complex-analytic proof can be given by combining linear algebra with the Cauchy theorem. To establish that every complex polynomial of degree n > 0 has a zero, it suffices to show that every complex square matrix of size n > 0 has a (complex) eigenvalue.A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen here. The proof of the latter statement is by contradiction. Let A be a complex square matrix of size n > 0 and let In be the unit matrix of the same size. Assume A has no eigenvalues. Consider the resolvent function : R(z)=(zI_n-A)^{-1}, which is a meromorphic function on the complex plane with values in the vector space of matrices. The eigenvalues of A are precisely the poles of R(z). Since, by assumption, A has no eigenvalues, the function R(z) is an entire function and Cauchy theorem implies that : \\\\int_{c(r)} R(z) \\\\, dz =0. On the other hand, R(z) expanded as a geometric series gives: :R(z)=z^{-1}(I_n-z^{-1}A)^{-1}=z^{-1}\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{z^k}A^k\\\\cdot This formula is valid outside the closed disc of radius \\\\A\\\\(the operator norm of A). Let r>\\\\A\\\\. Then :\\\\int_{c(r)}R(z)dz=\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\int_{c(r)}\\\\frac{dz}{z^{k+1}}A^k=2\\\\pi iI_n (in which only the summand k = 0 has a nonzero integral). This is a contradiction, and so A has an eigenvalue. Finally, Rouch√©'s theorem gives perhaps the shortest proof of the theorem. =Topological proofs= Suppose the minimum of p(z)on the whole complex plane is achieved at z0; it was seen at the proof which uses Liouville's theorem that such a number must exist. We can write p(z) as a polynomial in z ‚àí z0: there is some natural number k and there are some complex numbers ck, ck + 1, ..., cn such that ck ‚â† 0 and: :p(z)=p(z_0)+c_k(z-z_0)^k+c_{k+1}(z-z_0)^{k+1}+ \\\\cdots +c_n(z-z_0)^n. If p(z0) is nonzero, it follows that if a is a kth root of ‚àíp(z0)/ck and if t is positive and sufficiently small, then p(z0 + ta)< p(z0), which is impossible, since p(z0)is the minimum of pon D. For another topological proof by contradiction, suppose that the polynomial p(z) has no roots, and consequently is never equal to 0. Think of the polynomial as a map from the complex plane into the complex plane. It maps any circle z= R into a closed loop, a curve P(R). We will consider what happens to the winding number of P(R) at the extremes when R is very large and when R = 0. When R is a sufficiently large number, then the leading term zn of p(z) dominates all other terms combined; in other words, :\\\\left z^n \\\\right > \\\\left a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_0 \\\\right . When z traverses the circle Re^{i\\\\theta} once counter-clockwise (0\\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\leq 2\\\\pi), then z^n=R^ne^{in\\\\theta} winds n times counter-clockwise (0\\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\leq 2\\\\pi n) around the origin (0,0), and P(R) likewise. At the other extreme, with z= 0, the curve P(0) is merely the single point p(0), which must be nonzero because p(z) is never zero. Thus p(0) must be distinct from the origin (0,0), which denotes 0 in the complex plane. The winding number of P(0) around the origin (0,0) is thus 0. Now changing R continuously will deform the loop continuously. At some R the winding number must change. But that can only happen if the curve P(R) includes the origin (0,0) for some R. But then for some z on that circle z= R we have p(z) = 0, contradicting our original assumption. Therefore, p(z) has at least one zero. =Algebraic proofs= These proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra must make use of the following two facts about real numbers that are not algebraic but require only a small amount of analysis (more precisely, the intermediate value theorem in both cases): * every polynomial with odd degree and real coefficients has some real root; * every non-negative real number has a square root. The second fact, together with the quadratic formula, implies the theorem for real quadratic polynomials. In other words, algebraic proofs of the fundamental theorem actually show that if R is any real-closed field, then its extension C = R() is algebraically closed. As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement \\"every non-constant polynomial p(z) with real coefficients has a complex root\\". This statement can be proved by induction on the greatest non-negative integer k such that 2k divides the degree n of p(z). Let a be the coefficient of zn in p(z) and let F be a splitting field of p(z) over C; in other words, the field F contains C and there are elements z1, z2, ..., zn in F such that :p(z)=a(z-z_1)(z-z_2) \\\\cdots (z-z_n). If k = 0, then n is odd, and therefore p(z) has a real root. Now, suppose that n = 2km (with m odd and k > 0) and that the theorem is already proved when the degree of the polynomial has the form 2k ‚àí 1m‚Ä≤ with m‚Ä≤ odd. For a real number t, define: :q_t(z)=\\\\prod_{1\\\\le i Then the coefficients of qt(z) are symmetric polynomials in the zi with real coefficients. Therefore, they can be expressed as polynomials with real coefficients in the elementary symmetric polynomials, that is, in ‚àía1, a2, ..., (‚àí1)nan. So qt(z) has in fact real coefficients. Furthermore, the degree of qt(z) is n(n ‚àí 1)/2 = 2k‚àí1m(n ‚àí 1), and m(n ‚àí 1) is an odd number. So, using the induction hypothesis, qt has at least one complex root; in other words, zi + zj + tzizj is complex for two distinct elements i and j from {1, ..., n}. Since there are more real numbers than pairs (i, j), one can find distinct real numbers t and s such that zi + zj + tzizj and zi + zj + szizj are complex (for the same i and j). So, both zi + zj and zizj are complex numbers. It is easy to check that every complex number has a complex square root, thus every complex polynomial of degree 2 has a complex root by the quadratic formula. It follows that zi and zj are complex numbers, since they are roots of the quadratic polynomial z2 ‚àí (zi + zj)z + zizj. Joseph Shipman showed in 2007 that the assumption that odd degree polynomials have roots is stronger than necessary; any field in which polynomials of prime degree have roots is algebraically closed (so \\"odd\\" can be replaced by \\"odd prime\\" and furthermore this holds for fields of all characteristics).Shipman, J. Improving the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra The Mathematical Intelligencer, Volume 29 (2007), Number 4. pp. 9-14 For axiomatization of algebraically closed fields, this is the best possible, as there are counterexamples if a single prime is excluded. However, these counterexamples rely on ‚àí1 having a square root. If we take a field where ‚àí1 has no square root, and every polynomial of degree n ‚àà I has a root, where I is any fixed infinite set of odd numbers, then every polynomial f(x) of odd degree has a root (since has a root, where k is chosen so that ). Mohsen Aliabadi generalized Shipman's result in 2013, providing an independent proof that a sufficient condition for an arbitrary field (of any characteristic) to be algebraically closed is that it has a root for every polynomial of prime degree.M. Aliabadi, M. R. Darafsheh, On maximal and minimal linear matching property, Algebra and discrete mathematics, Volume 15 (2013). Number 2. pp. 174‚Äì178 Another algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem can be given using Galois theory. It suffices to show that C has no proper finite field extension.A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen here. Let K/C be a finite extension. Since the normal closure of K over R still has a finite degree over C (or R), we may assume without loss of generality that K is a normal extension of R (hence it is a Galois extension, as every algebraic extension of a field of characteristic 0 is separable). Let G be the Galois group of this extension, and let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, so that the order of H is a power of 2, and the index of H in G is odd. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there exists a subextension L of K/R such that Gal(K/L) = H. As [L:R] = [G:H] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have L = R, thus [K:R] and [K:C] are powers of 2. Assuming by way of contradiction that [K:C] > 1, we conclude that the 2-group Gal(K/C) contains a subgroup of index 2, so there exists a subextension M of C of degree 2\\\\. However, C has no extension of degree 2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. This shows that [K:C] = 1, and therefore K = C, which completes the proof. =Geometric proofs= There exists still another way to approach the fundamental theorem of algebra, due to J. M. Almira and A. Romero: by Riemannian geometric arguments. The main idea here is to prove that the existence of a non-constant polynomial p(z) without zeros implies the existence of a flat Riemannian metric over the sphere S2. This leads to a contradiction, since the sphere is not flat. A Riemannian surface (M, g) is said to be flat if its Gaussian curvature, which we denote by Kg, is identically null. Now, Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem, when applied to the sphere S2, claims that :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{S}^2}K_g=4\\\\pi, which proves that the sphere is not flat. Let us now assume that n > 0 and :p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + \\\\cdots + a_n z^n eq 0 for each complex number z. Let us define :p^*(z) = z^n p \\\\left ( \\\\tfrac{1}{z} \\\\right ) = a_0 z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_n. Obviously, p*(z) ‚â† 0 for all z in C. Consider the polynomial f(z) = p(z)p*(z). Then f(z) ‚â† 0 for each z in C. Furthermore, :f(\\\\tfrac{1}{w}) = p \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{w} \\\\right )p^* \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{w} \\\\right ) = w^{-2n}p^*(w)p(w) = w^{-2n}f(w). We can use this functional equation to prove that g, given by :g=\\\\frac{1}{f(w)^{\\\\frac{2}{n}}}\\\\,dw^2 for w in C, and :g=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left f\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{w} \\\\right ) \\\\right ^{\\\\frac{2}{n}}}\\\\left d\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{w} \\\\right ) \\\\right ^2 for w ‚àà S2\\\\\\\\{0}, is a well defined Riemannian metric over the sphere S2 (which we identify with the extended complex plane C ‚à™ {‚àû}). Now, a simple computation shows that :\\\\forall w\\\\in\\\\mathbf{C}: \\\\qquad \\\\frac{1}{f(w)^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}} K_g=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\Delta \\\\logf(w)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\Delta \\\\text{Re}(\\\\log f(w))=0, since the real part of an analytic function is harmonic. This proves that Kg = 0\\\\. Corollaries Since the fundamental theorem of algebra can be seen as the statement that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, it follows that any theorem concerning algebraically closed fields applies to the field of complex numbers. Here are a few more consequences of the theorem, which are either about the field of real numbers or about the relationship between the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers: * The field of complex numbers is the algebraic closure of the field of real numbers. * Every polynomial in one variable z with complex coefficients is the product of a complex constant and polynomials of the form z + a with a complex. * Every polynomial in one variable x with real coefficients can be uniquely written as the product of a constant, polynomials of the form x + a with a real, and polynomials of the form x2 + ax + b with a and b real and a2 ‚àí 4b < 0 (which is the same thing as saying that the polynomial x2 + ax + b has no real roots). (By the Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem, the real numbers a and b are not necessarily expressible in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial, the basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of n-th roots.) This implies that the number of non-real complex roots is always even and remains even when counted with their multiplicity. * Every rational function in one variable x, with real coefficients, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a/(x ‚àí b)n (where n is a natural number, and a and b are real numbers), and rational functions of the form (ax + b)/(x2 + cx + d)n (where n is a natural number, and a, b, c, and d are real numbers such that c2 ‚àí 4d < 0). A corollary of this is that every rational function in one variable and real coefficients has an elementary primitive. * Every algebraic extension of the real field is isomorphic either to the real field or to the complex field. Bounds on the zeros of a polynomial While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result, it is of some interest, both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view, to have information on the location of the zeros of a given polynomial. The simpler result in this direction is a bound on the modulus: all zeros Œ∂ of a monic polynomial z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1z +a_0 satisfy an inequality Œ∂‚â§ R‚àû, where :R_{\\\\infty}:= 1+\\\\max\\\\\\\\{a_0,\\\\ldots,a_{n-1}\\\\\\\\}. Notice that, as stated, this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an a priori bound: it says that if there are solutions then they lie inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius R‚àû. However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any p-norm of the n-vector of coefficients a:=( a_0, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_{n-1}), that is Œ∂‚â§ Rp, where Rp is precisely the q-norm of the 2-vector (1, \\\\a\\\\_p), q being the conjugate exponent of p, \\\\tfrac{1}{p} + \\\\tfrac{1}{q} =1, for any 1 ‚â§ p ‚â§ ‚àû. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by : R_1:= \\\\max\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1 , \\\\sum_{0\\\\leq k : R_p:= \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{0\\\\leq k for 1 < p < ‚àû, and in particular : R_2:= \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{0\\\\leq k\\\\leq n} a_k^2 } (where we define an to mean 1, which is reasonable since 1 is indeed the n-th coefficient of our polynomial). The case of a generic polynomial of degree n, :P(z):= a_n z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1z +a_0, is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by an ‚â† 0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. a0 ‚â† 0, bounds from below on the roots Œ∂ follow immediately as bounds from above on \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\zeta}, that is, the roots of :a_0 z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_{n-1}z +a_n. Finally, the distance \\\\zeta-\\\\zeta_0from the roots Œ∂ to any point \\\\zeta_0 can be estimated from below and above, seeing \\\\zeta-\\\\zeta_0 as zeros of the polynomial P(z+\\\\zeta_0), whose coefficients are the Taylor expansion of P(z) at z=\\\\zeta_0. Let Œ∂ be a root of the polynomial :z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1z +a_0; in order to prove the inequality Œ∂‚â§ Rp we can assume, of course, Œ∂> 1. Writing the equation as :-\\\\zeta^n=a_{n-1}\\\\zeta^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1\\\\zeta+a_0, and using the H√∂lder's inequality we find :\\\\zeta^n\\\\leq \\\\a\\\\_p \\\\left \\\\\\\\left (\\\\zeta^{n-1},\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta, 1 \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\_q. Now, if p = 1, this is :\\\\zeta^n\\\\leq\\\\a\\\\_1\\\\max \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\zeta^{n-1},\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta,1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} =\\\\a\\\\_1\\\\zeta^{n-1}, thus :\\\\zeta\\\\leq \\\\max\\\\\\\\{1, \\\\a\\\\_1\\\\\\\\}. In the case 1 < p ‚â§ ‚àû, taking into account the summation formula for a geometric progression, we have :\\\\zeta^n\\\\leq \\\\a\\\\_p \\\\left(\\\\zeta^{q(n-1)}+\\\\cdots+\\\\zeta^q +1\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}=\\\\a\\\\_p \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{qn}-1}{\\\\zeta^q-1}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}\\\\leq\\\\a\\\\_p \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{qn}}{\\\\zeta^q-1}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}, thus :\\\\zeta^{nq}\\\\leq \\\\a\\\\_p^q \\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{qn}}{\\\\zeta^q-1} and simplifying, :\\\\zeta^q\\\\leq 1+\\\\a\\\\_p^q. Therefore :\\\\zeta\\\\leq \\\\left \\\\\\\\left (1,\\\\a\\\\_p \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\_q=R_p holds, for all 1 ‚â§ p ‚â§ ‚àû.

Biography Kazantzakis in 1904 When Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in Kandiye, now Heraklion, Crete had not yet joined the modern Greek state (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the University of Athens: his 1906 Juris Doctor thesis title was Œü Œ¶œÅŒµŒπŒ¥ŒµœÅŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ ŒùŒØœÑœÉŒµ ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒØŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµŒØŒ±œÇ (\\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Law and the State\\"). Then he went to the Sorbonne in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of Henri Bergson. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cit√© (\\"Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State\\"). Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914 he met Angelos Sikelianos. Together they travelled for two years in places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely influenced by the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos. Kazantzakis married Galatea Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. He married Eleni Samiou in 1945. Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and Berlin (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in Cyprus, Aegina, Egypt, Mount Sinai, Czechoslovakia, Nice (he later bought a villa in nearby Antibes, in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan. While in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of Vladimir Lenin. He never became a committed communist, but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the Left Opposition politician and writer Victor Serge. He witnessed the rise of Joseph Stalin, and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology. As a journalist in 1926 he got interviews from Miguel Primo de Rivera and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. The 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as main motif for a high-value euro collectors' coin; the ‚Ç¨10 Greek Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin, minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the National Emblem of Greece with his signature. Death Epitaph on the grave of Kazantzakis in Heraklion. It reads \\"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\\" During WWII he was in Athens and translated the Iliad, together with the philologist Ioannis Kakridis. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, The Society of Greek Writers recommended that Kazantzakis and Angelos Sikelianos be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1957, he lost the Prize to Albert Camus by one vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour \\"a hundred times more\\" than himself.The Philosophers' Magazine, Issues 13‚Äì20, 2001 p. 120 In total Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years.Nomination Database Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, he set out on one last trip to China and Japan. Falling ill on his return flight, he was transferred to Freiburg, Germany, where he died. He is buried on the wall surrounding the city of Heraklion near the Chania Gate, looking out over the mountains and sea of Crete. His epitaph reads \\"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\\" (ŒîŒµŒΩ ŒµŒªœÄŒØŒ∂œâ œÑŒØœÄŒøœÑŒ±. ŒîŒµ œÜŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒºŒ±Œπ œÑŒØœÄŒøœÑŒ±. ŒïŒØŒºŒ±Œπ ŒªŒ≠œÜœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ.) Literary work Kazantzakis' first published work was the 1906 narrative, Serpent and Lily (ŒåœÜŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒöœÅŒØŒΩŒø), which he signed with the pen name Karma Nirvami. In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Henry Bergson, primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought. The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis' later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled Comedy, which was filled with existential themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus. After completing his studies in Paris, he wrote the tragedy, \\"The Master Builder\\" (Œü Œ†œÅœâœÑŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒøœÅŒ±œÇ), based on a popular Greek folkloric myth. Medallion honoring Kazantzakis in the Venetian loggia of Heraklion Through the next several decades, from the 1910s through the 1930s, Kazantzakis traveled around Greece, much of Europe, northern Africa, and to several countries in Asia. Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others. These journeys put Kazantzakis in contact with different philosophies, ideologies, lifestyles, and people, all of which influenced him and his writings. Kazantzakis would often write about his influences in letters to friends, citing Sigmund Freud, the philosophy of Nietzsche, Buddhist theology, and communist ideology and major influences. While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period. Kazantzakis began writing The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision. The poem follows the hero of Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer's Odyssey, it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines. While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, \\"some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,\\" with many scholars still being split to this day. A common criticism of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel was aimed at Kazantzakis' over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction. Many of Kazantzakis' most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including Zorba the Greek (1946), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1953), The Last Temptation of Christ (1955), and Report to Greco (1961). Scholar Peter Bein argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the Greek Civil War, gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs. These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends. As the scholar Peter Bein argued, \\"Kazantzakis viewed Greece's special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,\\" echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis' novels. Two of these works of fiction, Zorba the Greek and The Last Temptation of Christ had major motion picture adaptations in 1964 and 1988 respectively.Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin  Language and use of Demotic Greek  During the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of \\"serious\\" Greek artistic work was written in Katharevousa, a \\"pure\\" form of the Greek language that was created to bridge Ancient Greek with Modern, Demotic Greek, and to \\"purify\\" Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only in the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the New Athenian School (or Palamian). In his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people, and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen. Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. Or, in his own words, \\"Why not show off all the possibilities of demotic Greek?\\" Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece, and incorporate them into his writing for posterity. At the time of writing, some scholars and critics panned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek. Several critics have argued that Kazantzakis' writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read, despite the fact that his works were written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bein argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece. Bein asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metaphors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.  Socialism  Throughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that \\"only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means\\" could provide an equitable solution to the \\"frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.\\" He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of \\"socialist democracy\\" could prevail not just in Greece, but throughout the civilized world. He described socialism as a social system which \\"does not permit the exploitation of one person by another\\" and that \\"must guarantee every freedom.\\" Kazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II. The right waged war against his books and called him \\"immoral\\" and a \\"Bolshevik troublemaker\\" and accused him of being a \\"Russian agent\\". He was also distrusted by the Greek and Russian Communist parties as a \\"bourgeois\\" thinker. However, upon his death in 1957, he was honored by the Chinese Communist party as a \\"great writer\\" and \\"devotee of peace.\\" Following the war, he was temporarily leader of a minor Greek leftist party, while in 1945 he was, among others, a founding member of the Greek-Soviet friendship union.  Religious beliefs and relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church  While Kazantzakis was deeply spiritual, he often discussed his struggle with religious faith, specifically his Greek Orthodoxy. Baptized Greek Orthodox as a child, he was fascinated by the lives of saints from a young age. As a young man he took a month long trip to Mount Athos, a major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy. Most critics and scholars of Kazantzakis agree that the struggle to find truth in religion and spirituality was central to a great deal of his works, and that some novels, like The Last Temptation of Christ and Christ Recrucified focus completely on questioning Christian morals and values. As he traveled Europe, he was influenced by various philosophers, cultures, and religions, like Buddhism, causing him to question his Christian beliefs. While never claiming to be an atheist, his public questioning and critique of the most fundamental Christian values put him at odds with some in the Greek Orthodox church, and many of his critics. Scholars theorize that Kazantzakis' difficult relationship with many members of the clergy, and the more religiously conservative literary critics, came from his questioning. In his book, Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology, author Darren Middleton theorizes that, \\"Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God's immutability, Jesus' deity, and our salvation through God's grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus' humanity, and God's own redemption through our effort,\\" highlighting Kazantzakis' uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs. Many Orthodox Church clergy condemned Kazantzakis' work and a campaign was started to excommunicate him. His reply was: \\"You gave me a curse, Holy fathers, I give you a blessing: may your conscience be as clear as mine and may you be as moral and religious as I\\" (Greek: \\"ŒúŒøœÖ Œ¥œéœÉŒ±œÑŒµ ŒºŒπŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÅŒ±, ŒÜŒ≥ŒπŒøŒπ œÄŒ±œÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ, œÉŒ±œÇ Œ¥ŒØŒΩœâ Œ∫Œπ ŒµŒ≥œé ŒºŒπŒ± ŒµœÖœáŒÆ: Œ£Œ±œÇ ŒµœçœáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ ŒΩŒ± ‚ÄòŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∑ œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÉŒ∑ œÉŒ±œÇ œÑœåœÉŒø Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒÆ, œåœÉŒø ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∑ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒºŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒΩŒ± ‚ÄòœÉœÑŒµ œÑœåœÉŒø Œ∑Œ∏ŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∏œÅŒÆœÉŒ∫ŒøŒπ œåœÉŒø ŒµŒØŒºŒ±Œπ ŒµŒ≥œé\\"). While the excommunication was rejected by the top leadership of the Orthodox Church, it became emblematic of the persistent disapprobation from many Christian authorities for his political and religious views. Modern scholarship tends to dismiss the idea that Kazantzakis was being sacrilegious or blasphemous with the content of his novels and beliefs. These scholars argue that, if anything, Kazantzakis was acting in accordance to a long tradition of Christians who publicly struggled with their faith, and grew a stronger and more personal connection to God through their doubt. Moreover, scholars like Darren J. N. Middleton argue that Kazantzakis' interpretation of the Christian faith predated the more modern, personalized interpretation of Christianity that has become popular in the years after Kazantzakis' death. The Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras, the leader of the Orthodox Church, declared in 1961 in Heraklion: ‚ÄúKazantzakis is a great man and his works grace the Patriarchal library.‚Äù Bibliography of English translations Plaque for Kazantzakis, 13 rue Du Sommerard, Paris A bust in Heraklion Postcard from Nikos Kazantzakis to his physician Max-Hermann H√∂rder, 13 September 1957, Chongqing =Translations of The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, in whole or in part= *The Odyssey [Selections from], partial translation in prose by Kimon Friar, Wake 12 (1953), pp. 58‚Äì65. *The Odyssey, excerpt translated by Kimon Friar, Chicago Review 8, No. 2 (Spring/Summer 1954), pp. 12‚Äì18. *\\"The Return of Odysseus\\", partial translation by Kimon Friar, The Atlantic Monthly 195, No. 6 (June 1955), pp. 110‚Äì112. *The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, a full verse- translation by Kimon Friar, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1958; London: Secker and Warburg, 1958. *\\"Death, the Ant\\", from The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, Book XV, 829‚Äì63, translated by Kimon Friar, The Charioteer, No. 1 (Summer 1960), p. 39\\\\. =Travel books= *Spain, translated by Amy Mims, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1963. *Japan, China, translated by George C.

An integer sequence may be specified explicitly by giving a formula for its nth term, or implicitly by giving a relationship between its terms. For example, the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... (the Fibonacci sequence) is formed by starting with 0 and 1 and then adding any two consecutive terms to obtain the next one: an implicit description. The sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, ... is formed according to the formula n2 ‚àí 1 for the nth term: an explicit definition. Alternatively, an integer sequence may be defined by a property which members of the sequence possess and other integers do not possess. For example, we can determine whether a given integer is a perfect number, even though we do not have a formula for the nth perfect number.  Examples  Integer sequences that have their own name include: *Abundant numbers *Baum‚ÄìSweet sequence *Bell numbers *Binomial coefficients *Carmichael numbers *Catalan numbers *Composite numbers *Deficient numbers *Euler numbers *Even and odd numbers *Factorial numbers *Fibonacci numbers *Fibonacci word *Figurate numbers *Golomb sequence *Happy numbers *Highly composite numbers *Highly totient numbers *Home primes *Hyperperfect numbers *Juggler sequence *Kolakoski sequence *Lucky numbers *Lucas numbers *Motzkin numbers *Natural numbers *Padovan numbers *Partition numbers *Perfect numbers *Prime numbers *Pseudoprime numbers *Recam√°n's sequence *Regular paperfolding sequence *Rudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence *Semiperfect numbers *Semiprime numbers *Superperfect numbers *Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence *Ulam numbers *Weird numbers *Wolstenholme number  Computable and definable sequences  An integer sequence is a computable sequence if there exists an algorithm which, given n, calculates an, for all n > 0\\\\. The set of computable integer sequences is countable. The set of all integer sequences is uncountable (with cardinality equal to that of the continuum), and so not all integer sequences are computable. Although some integer sequences have definitions, there is no systematic way to define what it means for an integer sequence to be definable in the universe or in any absolute (model independent) sense. Suppose the set M is a transitive model of ZFC set theory. The transitivity of M implies that the integers and integer sequences inside M are actually integers and sequences of integers. An integer sequence is a definable sequence relative to M if there exists some formula P(x) in the language of set theory, with one free variable and no parameters, which is true in M for that integer sequence and false in M for all other integer sequences. In each such M, there are definable integer sequences that are not computable, such as sequences that encode the Turing jumps of computable sets. For some transitive models M of ZFC, every sequence of integers in M is definable relative to M; for others, only some integer sequences are (Hamkins et al. 2013). There is no systematic way to define in M itself the set of sequences definable relative to M and that set may not even exist in some such M. Similarly, the map from the set of formulas that define integer sequences in M to the integer sequences they define is not definable in M and may not exist in M. However, in any model that does possess such a definability map, some integer sequences in the model will not be definable relative to the model (Hamkins et al. 2013). If M contains all integer sequences, then the set of integer sequences definable in M will exist in M and be countable and countable in M.  Complete sequences  A sequence of positive integers is called a complete sequence if every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of values in the sequence, using each value at most once.

For much of its existence, the territory was bordered by Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland and Ethiopia. From 1940 to 1941, it was occupied by the Italians and was part of Italian East Africa. On 26 June 1960, British Somaliland declared independence as the State of Somaliland. Five days later, on 1 July 1960, the State of Somaliland voluntarily united with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic.SomaliaEncyclop√¶dia Britannica, The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: 2002), p.835 The government of Somaliland, a self-declared sovereign state that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia, \\"The Somali Republic shall have the following boundaries.

History =Treaties and establishment= Sultans of the Isaaq clan in Hargeisa, Somaliland Mohamoud Ali Shire Sultan of the Warsangali clan In 1887, after signing successive treaties with the then ruling Somali Sultans from the Isaaq, Issa, Gadabursi, and Warsangali clans the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland.Hugh Chisholm (ed.), The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p.383. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it from their British India colony until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office. Generally, the British did not have much interest in the resource- barren region.Samatar, Abdi Ismail The State and Rural Transformation in Northern Somalia, 1884‚Äì1986, Madison: 1989, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 31 The stated purposes of the establishment of the protectorate were to \\"secure a supply market, check the traffic in slaves, and to exclude the interference of foreign powers.\\" Samatar p. 31 The British principally viewed the protectorate as a source for supplies of meat for their British Indian outpost in Aden through the maintenance of order in the coastal areas and protection of the caravan routes from the interior.Samatar, p. 32 Hence, the region's nickname of \\"Aden's butcher's shop\\".Samatar, Unhappy Masses and the Challenge of Political Islam in the Horn of Africa, Somalia Online retrieved 10-03-27 Colonial administration during this period did not extend administrative infrastructure beyond the coast,Samatar, The state and rural transformation in Northern Somaliap. 42 and contrasted with the more interventionist colonial experience of Italian Somalia. =Dervish Uprising= Aerial view of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's main fort in Taleh, the capital of his Dervish movement Beginning in 1899, the British were forced to expend considerable human and military capital to contain a decades-long resistance movement mounted by the Dervish resistance movement. The movement was led by Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, a Somali religious leader referred to colloquially by the British as the \\"Mad Mullah\\". Repeated military expeditions were unsuccessfully launched against Hassan and his Dervishes before World War I. 1911 map of Somaliland and Somalia showing British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland On 9 August 1913, the Somaliland Camel Constabulary suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Dul Madoba at the hands of the Dervishes. Hassan had already evaded several attempts to capture him. At Dul Madoba, his forces killed or wounded 57 members of the 110-man Constabulary unit, including the British commander, Colonel Richard Corfield. In 1914, the British created the Somaliland Camel Corps to assist in maintaining order in British Somaliland. In 1920, the British launched their fifth and final expedition against Hassan and his followers. Employing the then-new technology of military aircraft, the British finally managed to quell Hassan's twenty- year-long struggle. The aerial attack on the Dervish capital, Taleh, killed many members of Hassan's family who had been lured there by the British for an official visit. Hassan and his Dervish supporters fled into the Ogaden, where Hassan died in 1921.Samatar, The state and rural transformation in Northern Somalia, p. 39 =Somaliland Camel Corps= Somaliland Camel Corps between Berbera and Odweyne in 1913. The Somaliland Camel Corps, also referred to as the Somali Camel Corps, was a unit of the British Army based in British Somaliland. It lasted from the early 20th century until 1944. The troopers of the Somaliland Camel Corps had a distinctive dress. It was based on the standard British Army khaki drill but included a knitted woollen pullover and drill patches on the shoulders. Shorts were worn with woollen socks on puttees and \\"chaplis\\", boots or bare feet. Equipment consisted of leather ammunition bandolier and a leather waist belt. The officers wore pith helmets and khaki drill uniforms. Other ranks wore a \\"kullah\\" with \\"puggree\\" which ended in a long tail which hung down the back.Mollo, p. 139 A \\"chaplis\\" is typically a colourful sandal. A \\"kullah\\" is a type of cap. A \\"puggree\\" is typically a strip of cloth wound around the upper portion of a hat or helmet, particularly a pith helmet, and falling down behind to act as a shade for the back of the neck. =British Somaliland 1920‚Äì1930= Market in Hargeisa. Following the defeat of the Dervish resistance, the two fundamental goals of British policy in British Somaliland were the preservation of stability and the economic self-sufficiency of the protectorate.Samatar, p. 45 The second goal remained particularly elusive because of local resistance to taxation that might have been used to support the protectorate's administration.Samatar, p. 46 By the 1930s, the British presence had extended to other parts of British Somaliland. Growth in commercial trade motivated some livestock herders to subsequently leave the pastoral economy and settle in urban areas.Samatar, pp. 52‚Äì53 Customs taxes also helped pay for British India's patrol of Somalia's Red Sea Coast. =Italian invasion= In August 1940, during the East African Campaign in World War II, British Somaliland was invaded by Italy. The few British forces that were present attempted to defend the main road to Berbera, but were dislodged from their positions and retreated after losing the Battle of Tug Argan. During this period, the British rounded up soldiers and governmental officials to evacuate them from the territory through Berbera. In total, 7,000 people, including civilians, were evacuated.Playfair (1954), p. 178 The Somalis serving in the Somaliland Camel Corps were given the choice of evacuation or disbandment; the majority chose to remain and were allowed to retain their arms.Wavell, p. 2724 In March 1941, after a six-month Italian occupation, the British Imperial forces recaptured the protectorate during Operation Appearance. The final remnants of the Italian guerrilla movement discontinued all resistance in British Somaliland by the autumn of 1943. =Independence and union with the Trust Territory of Somaliland= Agreements and Exchanges of Letters between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Somaliland in connexion with the Attainment of Independence by Somalilandhttp://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1960-TS0044.pdf In 1947, the entire budget for the administration of the British Somaliland protectorate was only ¬£213,139. In May 1960, the British Government stated that it would be prepared to grant independence to the then Somaliland protectorate. The Legislative Council of British Somaliland passed a resolution in April 1960 requesting independence. The legislative councils of the territory agreed to this proposal.Somali Independence Week In April 1960, leaders of the two territories met in Mogadishu and agreed to form a unitary state. An elected president was to be head of state. Full executive powers would be held by a prime minister answerable to an elected National Assembly of 123 members representing the two territories. On 26 June 1960, the British Somaliland protectorate gained independence as the State of Somaliland before uniting five days later with the Trust Territory of Somalia to form the Somali Republic (Somalia) on 1 July 1960. The legislature appointed the speaker Hagi Bashir Ismail Yousuf as first President of the Somali National Assembly and, the same day, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar become President of the Somali Republic. Somaliland In 1991, after a bloody civil war for independence in the northern part of Somali Democratic Republic, the area which formerly encompassed British Somaliland declared independence. In May 1991, the formation of the \\"Republic of Somaliland\\" was proclaimed, with the local government regarding it as the successor to the former British Somaliland as well as to the State of Somaliland. However, the Somaliland region's self- declared independence remains unrecognised by any country.UN in Action: Reforming Somaliland's Judiciary It is however recognised as one of the federal states of Somalia.

In mathematics, the surreal number system is a totally ordered proper class containing the real numbers as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers, respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number. The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered field. If formulated in von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory, the surreal numbers are a universal ordered field in the sense that all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the rational functions, the Levi-Civita field, the superreal numbers, and the hyperreal numbers, can be realized as subfields of the surreals. The surreals also contain all transfinite ordinal numbers; the arithmetic on them is given by the natural operations. It has also been shown (in von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory) that the maximal class hyperreal field is isomorphic to the maximal class surreal field; in theories without the axiom of global choice, this need not be the case, and in such theories it is not necessarily true that the surreals are a universal ordered field.  History of the concept  Research on the go endgame by John Horton Conway led to the original definition and construction of the surreal numbers. Conway's construction was introduced in Donald Knuth's 1974 book Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness. In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term surreal numbers for what Conway had called simply numbers. Conway later adopted Knuth's term, and used surreals for analyzing games in his 1976 book On Numbers and Games. A separate route to defining the surreals began in 1907, when Hans Hahn introduced Hahn series as a generalization of formal power series, and Hausdorff introduced certain ordered sets called Œ∑Œ±-sets for ordinals Œ± and asked if it was possible to find a compatible ordered group or field structure. In 1962 Alling used a modified form of Hahn series to construct such ordered fields associated to certain ordinals Œ±, and in 1987 he showed that taking Œ± to be the class of all ordinals in his construction gives a class that is an ordered field isomorphic to the surreal numbers. If the surreals are considered as ‚Äòjust‚Äô a proper class sized real closed field, Alling's 1962 paper handles the case of strongly inaccessible cardinals which can naturally be considered as proper classes by cutting off the cumulative hierarchy of the universe one stage above the cardinal, and Alling accordingly deserves much credit for the discovery/invention of the surreals in this sense. There is an important additional field structure on the surreals that isn't visible through this lens however, namely the notion of a ‚Äòbirthday‚Äô and the corresponding natural description of the surreals as the result of a cut-filling process along their birthdays given by Conway. This additional structure has become fundamental to a modern understanding of the surreal numbers, and Conway is thus given credit for discovering the surreals as we know them today ‚Äî Alling himself gives Conway full credit in a 1985 paper preceding his book on the subject. Overview In the Conway construction, the surreal numbers are constructed in stages, along with an ordering ‚â§ such that for any two surreal numbers a and b, a ‚â§ b or b ‚â§ a. (Both may hold, in which case a and b are equivalent and denote the same number.) Numbers are formed by pairing subsets of numbers already constructed: given subsets L and R of numbers such that all the members of L are strictly less than all the members of R, then the pair { L R } represents a number intermediate in value between all the members of L and all the members of R. Different subsets may end up defining the same number: { L R } and { L‚Ä≤ R‚Ä≤ } may define the same number even if L ‚â† L‚Ä≤ and R ‚â† R‚Ä≤. (A similar phenomenon occurs when rational numbers are defined as quotients of integers: 1/2 and 2/4 are different representations of the same rational number.) So strictly speaking, the surreal numbers are equivalence classes of representations of form { L R } that designate the same number. In the first stage of construction, there are no previously existing numbers so the only representation must use the empty set: { }. This representation, where L and R are both empty, is called 0. Subsequent stages yield forms like :{ 0 } = 1 :{ 1 } = 2 :{ 2 } = 3 and :{ 0 } = ‚àí1 :{ ‚àí1 } = ‚àí2 :{ ‚àí2 } = ‚àí3 The integers are thus contained within the surreal numbers. (The above identities are definitions, in the sense that the right-hand side is a name for the left- hand side. That the names are actually appropriate will be evident when the arithmetic operations on surreal numbers are defined, as in the section below). Similarly, representations such as :{ 0 1 } = 1/2 :{ 0 1/2 } = 1/4 :{ 1/2 1 } = 3/4 arise, so that the dyadic rationals (rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2) are contained within the surreal numbers. After an infinite number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any real number a can be represented by { La Ra }, where La is the set of all dyadic rationals less than a and Ra is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than a (reminiscent of a Dedekind cut). Thus the real numbers are also embedded within the surreals. There are also representations like :{ 0, 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ } = œâ :{ 0 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ‚Ä¶ } = Œµ where œâ is a transfinite number greater than all integers and Œµ is an infinitesimal greater than 0 but less than any positive real number. Moreover, the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be extended to these non-real numbers in a manner that turns the collection of surreal numbers into an ordered field, so that one can talk about 2œâ or œâ ‚àí 1 and so forth. Construction Surreal numbers are constructed inductively as equivalence classes of pairs of sets of surreal numbers, restricted by the condition that each element of the first set is smaller than each element of the second set. The construction consists of three interdependent parts: the construction rule, the comparison rule and the equivalence rule. =Forms= A form is a pair of sets of surreal numbers, called its left set and its right set. A form with left set L and right set R is written { L R }. When L and R are given as lists of elements, the braces around them are omitted. Either or both of the left and right set of a form may be the empty set. The form { { } { } } with both left and right set empty is also written { }. =Numeric forms= Construction Rule :A form { L R } is numeric if the intersection of L and R is the empty set and each element of R is greater than every element of L, according to the order relation ‚â§ given by the comparison rule below. =Equivalence classes of numeric forms= The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a surreal number. The elements of the left and right set of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of forms, but of their equivalence classes). Equivalence Rule : Two numeric forms x and y are forms of the same number (lie in the same equivalence class) if and only if both x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x. An ordering relationship must be antisymmetric, i.e., it must have the property that x = y (i. e., x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x are both true) only when x and y are the same object. This is not the case for surreal number forms, but is true by construction for surreal numbers (equivalence classes). The equivalence class containing { } is labeled 0; in other words, { } is a form of the surreal number 0. =Order= The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison: Given numeric forms x = { XL XR } and y = { YL YR }, x ‚â§ y if and only if: *there is no xL ‚àà XL such that y ‚â§ xL (every element in the left part of x is smaller than y), and *there is no yR ‚àà YR such that yR ‚â§ x (every element in the right part of y is bigger than x). A comparison y ‚â§ c between a form y and a surreal number c is performed by choosing a form z from the equivalence class c and evaluating y ‚â§ z; and likewise for c ‚â§ x and for comparison b ‚â§ c between two surreal numbers. =Induction= This group of definitions is recursive, and requires some form of mathematical induction to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them. The only surreal numbers reachable via finite induction are the dyadic fractions; a wider universe is reachable given some form of transfinite induction. Induction Rule * There is a generation S0 = { 0 }, in which 0 consists of the single form { }. * Given any ordinal number n, the generation Sn is the set of all surreal numbers that are generated by the construction rule from subsets of \\\\cup_{i < n} S_i. The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the \\"least ordinal\\". Since there exists no Si with i < 0, the expression \\\\cup_{i < 0} S_i is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore S0 consists of a single surreal form { } lying in a single equivalence class 0. For every finite ordinal number n, Sn is well-ordered by the ordering induced by the comparison rule on the surreal numbers. The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms { 0 } < { } < { 0 } (the form { 0 0 } is non-numeric because 0‚â§0). The equivalence class containing { 0 } is labeled 1 and the equivalence class containing { 0 } is labeled ‚àí1. These three labels have a special significance in the axioms that define a ring; they are the additive identity (0), the multiplicative identity (1), and the additive inverse of 1 (‚àí1). The arithmetic operations defined below are consistent with these labels. For every i < n, since every valid form in Si is also a valid form in Sn, all of the numbers in Si also appear in Sn (as supersets of their representation in Si). (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form Sn-1, so that the definition also makes sense when n is a limit ordinal.) Numbers in Sn that are a superset of some number in Si are said to have been inherited from generation i. The smallest value of Œ± for which a given surreal number appears in SŒ± is called its birthday. For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of ‚àí1 is 1. A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes: : { ‚àí1 } = { ‚àí1, 0 } = { ‚àí1, 1 } = { ‚àí1, 0, 1 } : < { 0 } = { 0, 1 } : < { ‚àí1 0 } = { ‚àí1 0, 1 } : < { } = { ‚àí1 } = { 1 } = { ‚àí1 1 } : < { 0 1 } = { ‚àí1, 0 1 } : < { 0 } = { ‚àí1, 0 } : < { 1 } = { 0, 1 } = { ‚àí1, 1 } = { ‚àí1, 0, 1 } Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent, irrespective of the choice of form. Three observations follow: # S2 contains four new surreal numbers. Two contain extremal forms: { ‚àí1, 0, 1 } contains all numbers from previous generations in its right set, and { ‚àí1, 0, 1 } contains all numbers from previous generations in its left set. The others have a form that partitions all numbers from previous generations into two non-empty sets. # Every surreal number x that existed in the previous \\"generation\\" exists also in this generation, and includes at least one new form: a partition of all numbers other than x from previous generations into a left set (all numbers less than x) and a right set (all numbers greater than x). # The equivalence class of a number depends only on the maximal element of its left set and the minimal element of the right set. The informal interpretations of { 1 } and { ‚àí1 } are \\"the number just after 1\\" and \\"the number just before ‚àí1\\" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and ‚àí2. The informal interpretations of { 0 1 } and { ‚àí1 0 } are \\"the number halfway between 0 and 1\\" and \\"the number halfway between ‚àí1 and 0\\" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 1/2 and ‚àí1/2. These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below. The equivalence classes at each stage n of induction may be characterized by their n-complete forms (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets). Either this complete form contains every number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number. We retain the labels from the previous generation for these \\"old\\" numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels: : ‚àí2 < ‚àí1 < ‚àí1/2 < 0 < 1/2 < 1 < 2\\\\. The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets. (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.) The number { 1, 2 5, 8 } is therefore equivalent to { 2 5 }; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the birthday property, which is a consequence of the rules above. Birthday property : A form x = { L R } occurring in generation n represents a number inherited from an earlier generation i < n if and only if there is some number in Si that is greater than all elements of L and less than all elements of the R. (In other words, if L and R are already separated by a number created at an earlier stage, then x does not represent a new number but one already constructed.) If x represents a number from any generation earlier than n, there is a least such generation i, and exactly one number c with this least i as its birthday lies between L and R. x is a form of this c, i. e., it lies in the equivalence class in Sn that is a superset of the representation of c in generation i. Arithmetic The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number forms x = { XL XR } and y = { YL YR } are defined by three recursive formulas. =Negation= Negation of a given number x = { XL XR } is defined by :-x = - \\\\\\\\{ X_L X_R \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ -X_R -X_L \\\\\\\\}, where the negation of a set S of numbers is given by the set of the negated elements of S: :-S = \\\\\\\\{ -s: s \\\\in S \\\\\\\\}. This formula involves the negation of the surreal numbers appearing in the left and right sets of x, which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the operand. This can be proven inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in XL and XR are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form x first occurs, and observing the special case: :-0 = - \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\} = 0. =Addition= The definition of addition is also a recursive formula: : x + y = \\\\\\\\{ X_L X_R \\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{ Y_L Y_R \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ X_L + y, x + Y_L X_R + y, x + Y_R \\\\\\\\}, where :X + y = \\\\\\\\{ x + y: x \\\\in X \\\\\\\\} , x + Y = \\\\\\\\{ x + y: y \\\\in Y \\\\\\\\}. This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other. These are to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the numeric operand, performing the sum of the two forms, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the numeric operand. This can also be proven inductively with the special cases: : 0 + 0 = { } + { } = { } = 0 : x + 0 = x + { } = { XL \\\\+ 0 XR \\\\+ 0 } = { XL XR } = x : 0 + y = { } + y = { 0 + YL 0 + YR } = { YL YR } = y (The latter two cases are themselves proven inductively.) =Multiplication= The recursive formula for multiplication contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R that appears in the left set of the product of x and y. This is to be understood as the set of surreal numbers resulting from choosing one number from each set that appears in the expression and evaluating the expression on these numbers. (In each individual evaluation of the expression, only one number is chosen from each set, and is substituted in each place where that set appears in the expression.) This depends, in turn, on the ability to (a) multiply pairs of surreal numbers drawn from the left and right sets of x and y to get a surreal number, and negate the result; (b) multiply the surreal number form x or y and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other operand to get a surreal number; and (c) add the resulting surreal numbers. This again involves special cases, this time containing 0 = { }, the multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 }, and its additive inverse -1 = { 0 }. : \\\\begin{align} xy & = \\\\\\\\{ X_L X_R \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\{ Y_L Y_R \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_L y + x Y_L - X_L Y_L, X_R y + x Y_R - X_R Y_R X_L y + x Y_R - X_L Y_R, x Y_L + X_R y - X_R Y_L \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} = Division = The definition of division is done in terms of the reciprocal and multiplication: \\\\frac xy = x \\\\left( \\\\frac 1y \\\\right) where \\\\frac 1y = \\\\Bigg \\\\\\\\{0, \\\\frac{1+(y_R-y)(\\\\frac1y)_L}{y_R}, \\\\frac{1+(y_L-y)(\\\\frac1y)_R}{y_L} \\\\Bigg \\\\frac{1+(y_L-y)(\\\\frac1y)_L}{y_L}, \\\\frac{1+(y_R-y)(\\\\frac1y)_R}{y_R} \\\\Bigg \\\\\\\\} for positive y. Only positive y_L are permitted in the formula, with any nonpositive terms being ignored (and y_R are always positive). This formula involves not only recursion in terms of being able to divide by numbers from the left and right sets of y, but also recursion in that the members of the left and right sets of \\\\frac 1y itself. 0 is always a member of the left set of \\\\frac 1y, and that can be used to find more terms in a recursive fashion. For example, if y = 3 = \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}, then we know a left term of \\\\frac 13 will be 0. This in turn means \\\\frac{1+(2-3)0}2=1/2 is a right term. This means \\\\frac{1+(2-3)\\\\left(\\\\frac12\\\\right)}2=\\\\frac14 is a left term. This means \\\\frac{1+(2-3)\\\\left(\\\\frac14\\\\right)}2 = \\\\frac 38 will be a right term. Continuing, this gives \\\\frac13 = \\\\\\\\{0, \\\\frac14, \\\\frac5{16}, \\\\ldots \\\\frac12, \\\\frac38, \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}. For negative y, \\\\frac 1y is given by \\\\frac1y=-\\\\left(\\\\frac1{-y}\\\\right). If y=0, then \\\\frac 1y is undefined. =Consistency= It can be shown that the definitions of negation, addition and multiplication are consistent, in the sense that: * addition and negation are defined recursively in terms of \\"simpler\\" addition and negation steps, so that operations on numbers with birthday n will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of operations on numbers with birthdays less than n; * multiplication is defined recursively in terms of additions, negations, and \\"simpler\\" multiplication steps, so that the product of numbers with birthday n will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of sums and differences of products of numbers with birthdays less than n; * as long as the operands are well-defined surreal number forms (each element of the left set is less than each element of the right set), the results are again well-defined surreal number forms; * the operations can be extended to numbers (equivalence classes of forms): the result of negating x or adding or multiplying x and y will represent the same number regardless of the choice of form of x and y; and * these operations obey the associativity, commutativity, additive inverse, and distributivity axioms in the definition of a field, with additive identity 0 = { } and multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 }. With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled. The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals: : S0 = { 0 } : S1 = { ‚àí1 < 0 < 1 } : S2 = { ‚àí2 < ‚àí1 < ‚àí1/2 < 0 < 1/2 < 1 < 2} : S3 = { ‚àí3 < ‚àí2 < ‚àí3/2 < ‚àí1 < ‚àí3/4 < ‚àí1/2 < ‚àí1/4 < 0 < 1/4 < 1/2 < 3/4 < 1 < 3/2 < 2 < 3 } : S4 = { ‚àí4 < ‚àí3 < ... < ‚àí1/8 < 0 < 1/8 < 1/4 < 3/8 < 1/2 < 5/8 < 3/4 < 7/8 < 1 < 5/4 < 3/2 < 7/4 < 2 < 5/2 < 3 < 4 } =Arithmetic closure= For each natural number (finite ordinal) n, all numbers generated in Sn are dyadic fractions, i.e., can be written as an irreducible fraction \\\\frac{a}{2^b} where a and b are integers and 0 ‚â§ b < n. The set of all surreal numbers that are generated in some Sn for finite n may be denoted as S* = \\\\cup_{n \\\\in N} S_n. One may form the three classes S0 = { 0 }, S+ = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in S_*: x > 0 \\\\\\\\}, and S‚àí = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in S_*: x < 0 \\\\\\\\}, of which S* is the union. No individual Sn is closed under addition and multiplication (except S0), but S* is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions. There are infinite ordinal numbers Œ≤ for which the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than Œ≤ is closed under the different arithmetic operations. For any ordinal Œ±, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than Œ≤ = œâŒ± (using powers of œâ) is closed under addition and forms a group; for birthday less than œâœâŒ± it is closed under multiplication and forms a ring; and for birthday less than an (ordinal) epsilon number ŒµŒ± it is closed under multiplicative inverse and forms a field. The latter sets are also closed under the exponential function as defined by Kruskal and Gonshor. However, it is always possible to construct a surreal number that is greater than any member of a set (by including the set on the left side of the constructor) and thus the collection of surreal numbers is a proper class. With their ordering and algebraic operations they constitute an ordered field, with the caveat that they do not form a set. In fact, it is a very special ordered field: the biggest one. Every other ordered field can be embedded in the surreals. The class of all surreal numbers is denoted by the symbol \\\\mathbf{No}.  Infinity  Define Sœâ as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of S*. (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number œâ is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can only be performed in a set theory that allows such a union.) A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in Sœâ: : \\\\omega = \\\\\\\\{ S_* \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \\\\\\\\}. Sœâ also contains objects that can be identified as the rational numbers. For example, the œâ-complete form of the fraction 1/3 is given by: : \\\\tfrac{1} {3} = \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in S_*: 3 y < 1 y \\\\in S_*: 3 y > 1 \\\\\\\\}. The product of this form of 1/3 with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1. Not only do all the rest of the rational numbers appear in Sœâ; the remaining finite real numbers do too. For example, : \\\\pi = \\\\\\\\{ 3, \\\\frac{25}{8},\\\\frac{201}{64}, ... 4, \\\\frac{7}{2}, \\\\frac{13}{4}, \\\\frac{51}{16},... \\\\\\\\}. The only infinities in Sœâ are œâ and ‚àíœâ; but there are other non-real numbers in Sœâ among the reals. Consider the smallest positive number in Sœâ: : \\\\varepsilon = \\\\\\\\{ S_- \\\\cup S_0 S_+ \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ 0 1, \\\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\tfrac{1}{4}, \\\\tfrac{1}{8}, ... \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ 0 y \\\\in S_* : y > 0 \\\\\\\\}. This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an infinitesimal number, often labeled Œµ. The œâ-complete form of Œµ (resp. -Œµ) is the same as the œâ-complete form of 0, except that 0 is included in the left (resp. right) set. The only \\"pure\\" infinitesimals in Sœâ are Œµ and its additive inverse -Œµ; adding them to any dyadic fraction y produces the numbers y¬±Œµ, which also lie in Sœâ. One can determine the relationship between œâ and Œµ by multiplying particular forms of them to obtain: : œâ ¬∑ Œµ = { Œµ ¬∑ S+ œâ ¬∑ S+ \\\\+ S* \\\\+ Œµ ¬∑ S* }. This expression is only well-defined in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to S_{\\\\omega^2}. In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of œâ ¬∑ Œµ are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore œâ ¬∑ Œµ is the oldest positive finite number, i. e., 1. Consequently, : 1/Œµ = œâ. Some authors systematically use œâ‚àí1 in place of the symbol Œµ. =Contents of Sœâ= Given any x = { L R } in Sœâ, exactly one of the following is true: * L and R are both empty, in which case x = 0; * R is empty and some integer n‚â•0 is greater than every element of L, in which case x equals the smallest such integer n; * R is empty and no integer n is greater than every element of L, in which case x equals +œâ; * L is empty and some integer n‚â§0 is less than every element of R, in which case x equals the largest such integer n; * L is empty and no integer n is less than every element of R, in which case x equals -œâ; * L and R are both non-empty, and:  some dyadic fraction y is \\"strictly between\\" L and R (greater than all elements of L and less than all elements of R), in which case x equals the oldest such dyadic fraction y;  no dyadic fraction y lies strictly between L and R, but some dyadic fraction y \\\\in L is greater than or equal to all elements of L and less than all elements of R, in which case x equals y+Œµ;  no dyadic fraction y lies strictly between L and R, but some dyadic fraction y \\\\in R is greater than all elements of L and less than or equal to all elements of R, in which case x equals y-Œµ;  every dyadic fraction is either greater than some element of R or less than some element of L, in which case x is some real number that has no representation as a dyadic fraction. Sœâ is not an algebraic field, because it is not closed under arithmetic operations; consider œâ+1, whose form \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., \\\\omega \\\\\\\\} does not lie in any number in Sœâ. The maximal subset of Sœâ that is closed under (finite series of) arithmetic operations is the field of real numbers, obtained by leaving out the infinities ¬±œâ, the infinitesimals ¬±Œµ, and the infinitesimal neighbors y¬±Œµ of each nonzero dyadic fraction y. This construction of the real numbers differs from the Dedekind cuts of standard analysis in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in Sœâ with its forms in previous generations. (The œâ-complete forms of real elements of Sœâ are in one-to-one correspondence with the reals obtained by Dedekind cuts, under the proviso that Dedekind reals corresponding to rational numbers are represented by the form in which the cut point is omitted from both left and right sets.) The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the surreal construction; they are merely the subset Q of Sœâ containing all elements x such that x b = a for some a and some nonzero b, both drawn from S*. By demonstrating that Q is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of Q is reachable from S* by a finite series (no longer than two, actually) of arithmetic operations including multiplicative inversion, one can show that Q is strictly smaller than the subset of Sœâ identified with the reals. The set Sœâ has the same cardinality as the real numbers R. This can be demonstrated by exhibiting surjective mappings from Sœâ to the closed unit interval I of R and vice versa. Mapping Sœâ onto I is routine; map numbers less than or equal to Œµ (including -œâ) to 0, numbers greater than or equal to 1-Œµ (including œâ) to 1, and numbers between Œµ and 1-Œµ to their equivalent in I (mapping the infinitesimal neighbors y¬±Œµ of each dyadic fraction y, along with y itself, to y). To map I onto Sœâ, map the (open) central third (1/3, 2/3) of I onto { } = 0; the central third (7/9, 8/9) of the upper third to { 0 } = 1; and so forth. This maps a nonempty open interval of I onto each element of S*, monotonically. The residue of I consists of the Cantor set 2œâ, each point of which is uniquely identified by a partition of the central-third intervals into left and right sets, corresponding precisely to a form { L R } in Sœâ. This places the Cantor set in one-to-one correspondence with the set of surreal numbers with birthday œâ.  Transfinite induction  Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond Sœâ produces more ordinal numbers Œ±, each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday Œ±. (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.) The first such ordinal is œâ+1 = { œâ }. There is another positive infinite number in generation œâ+1: : œâ‚àí1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... œâ }. The surreal number œâ‚àí1 is not an ordinal; the ordinal œâ is not the successor of any ordinal. This is a surreal number with birthday œâ+1, which is labeled œâ‚àí1 on the basis that it coincides with the sum of œâ = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... } and ‚àí1 = { 0 }. Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation œâ+1: : 2Œµ = Œµ + Œµ = { Œµ 1+Œµ, 1/2+Œµ, 1/4+Œµ, 1/8+Œµ, ... } and : Œµ/2 = Œµ ¬∑ 1/2 = { 0 Œµ }. At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than œâ+k for all natural numbers k: : 2œâ = œâ + œâ = { œâ+1, œâ+2, œâ+3, œâ+4, ... } This number may be labeled œâ + œâ both because its birthday is œâ + œâ (the first ordinal number not reachable from œâ by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of œâ and œâ; it may also be labeled 2œâ because it coincides with the product of œâ = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... } and 2 = { 1 }. It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from œâ via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on \\\\bigcup_{k < \\\\omega} S_{\\\\omega + k}. This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a \\"stronger\\" set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required. Note that the conventional addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations. The sum of ordinals 1 + œâ equals œâ, but the surreal sum is commutative and produces 1 + œâ = œâ + 1 > œâ. The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the natural sum and natural product of ordinals. Just as 2œâ is bigger than œâ + n for any natural number n, there is a surreal number œâ/2 that is infinite but smaller than œâ ‚àí n for any natural number n. That is, œâ/2 is defined by : œâ/2 = { S* œâ ‚àí S* } where on the right hand side the notation x ‚àí Y is used to mean { x ‚àí y : y in Y }. It can be identified as the product of œâ and the form { 0 1 } of 1/2. The birthday of œâ/2 is the limit ordinal œâ2.  Powers of œâ  To classify the \\"orders\\" of infinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers, also known as archimedean classes, Conway associated to each surreal number x the surreal number * œâx = { 0, r œâxL s œâxR }, where r and s range over the positive real numbers. If x < y then œây is \\"infinitely greater\\" than œâx, in that it is greater than r œâx for all real numbers r. Powers of œâ also satisfy the conditions * œâx œây = œâx+y, * œâ‚àíx = 1/œâx, so they behave the way one would expect powers to behave. Each power of œâ also has the redeeming feature of being the simplest surreal number in its archimedean class; conversely, every archimedean class within the surreal numbers contains a unique simplest member. Thus, for every positive surreal number x there will always exist some positive real number r and some surreal number y so that x ‚àí r œây is \\"infinitely smaller\\" than x. The exponent y is the \\"base œâ logarithm\\" of x, defined on the positive surreals; it can be demonstrated that logœâ maps the positive surreals onto the surreals and that logœâ(xy) = logœâ(x) + logœâ(y). This gets extended by transfinite induction so that every surreal number x has a \\"normal form\\" analogous to the Cantor normal form for ordinal numbers. Every surreal number may be uniquely written as * x = r0 œây0 \\\\+ r1 œây1 \\\\+ ..., where every rŒ± is a nonzero real number and the yŒ±s form a strictly decreasing sequence of surreal numbers. This \\"sum\\", however, may have infinitely many terms, and in general has the length of an arbitrary ordinal number. (Zero corresponds of course to the case of an empty sequence, and is the only surreal number with no leading exponent.) Looked at in this manner, the surreal numbers resemble a power series field, except that the decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and are not allowed to be as long as the class of ordinals. This is the basis for the formulation of the surreal numbers as a Hahn series. Gaps and continuity In contrast to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of the surreal numbers does not have a least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines a gap as {L R}, L < R, L ‚à™ R = ùêçùê®; this is not a number because at least one of the sides is a proper class. Though similar, gaps are not quite the same as Dedekind sections, but we can still talk about a completion ùêçùê®ùïØ of the surreal numbers with the natural ordering which is a (proper class-sized) linear continuum. For instance there is no least positive infinite surreal, but the gap ‚àû = {x: ‚àÉ n ‚àà ‚Ñï: x < n x: ‚àÄ n ‚àà ‚Ñï: x > n} is greater than all real numbers and less than all positive infinite surreals, and is thus the least upper bound of the reals in ùêçùê®ùïØ. Similarly the gap ùêéùêß = { ùêçùê® } is larger than all surreal numbers. (This is an esoteric pun: In the general construction of ordinals, Œ± \\"is\\" the set of ordinals smaller than Œ± and we can use this equivalence to write Œ± = { Œ± } in the surreals; ùêéùêß denotes the class of ordinal numbers, and because ùêéùêß is cofinal in ùêçùê® we have { ùêçùê® } = { ùêéùêß } = ùêéùêß by extension). With a bit of set-theoretic care ùêçùê® can be equipped with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences can be defined as well although they have to be indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap that can be expressed as ‚àëŒ±‚ààùêçùê®rŒ±œâaŒ± with aŒ± decreasing and having no lower bound in ùêçùê®. (All such gaps can be understood as Cauchy sequences themselves but there are other types of gap that are not limits, such as ‚àû and ùêéùêß). Exponential function Based on unpublished work by Kruskal, a construction (by transfinite induction) that extends the real exponential function exp(x) (with base e) to the surreals was carried through by Gonshor. =Other exponentials= The powers of œâ function is also an exponential function, but does not have the properties desired for an extension of the function on the reals. It will, however, be needed in the development of the base-e exponential, and it is this function that is meant whenever the notation œâx is used in the following. When y is a dyadic fraction, the power function , may be composed from multiplication, multiplicative inverse and square root, all of which can be defined inductively. Its values are completely determined by the basic relation and where defined it necessarily agrees with any other exponentiation that can exist. =Basic induction= The induction steps for the surreal exponential are based on the series expansion for the real exponential, more specifically those partial sums that can be shown by basic algebra to be positive but less than all later ones. For x positive these are denoted [x]n and include all partial sums; for x negative but finite, [x]2n+1 denotes the odd steps in the series starting from the first one with a positive real part (which always exists). For x negative infinite the odd-numbered partial sums are strictly decreasing and the [x]2n+1 notation denotes the empty set, but it turns out that the corresponding elements are not needed in the induction. The relations that hold for real are then and and this can be extended to the surreals with the definition This is well-defined for all surreal arguments (the value exists and does not depend on the choice of zL and zR). =Results= Using this definition, the following holds: * exp is a strictly increasing positive function, * exp satisfies * exp is a surjection (onto No+) and has a well- defined inverse, * exp coincides with the usual exponential function on the reals (and thus ) * For x infinitesimal, the value of the formal power series is well defined and coincides with the inductive definition  When x is given in Conway normal form, the set of exponents in the result is well-ordered and the coefficients are finite sums, directly giving the normal form of the result (which has a leading 1)  Similarly, for x infinitesimally close to 1, log x is given by power series expansion of * For positive infinite x, exp x is infinite as well  If x has the form œâŒ± (Œ± > 0), exp x has the form œâœâŒ≤ where Œ≤ is a strictly increasing function of Œ±. In fact there is an inductively defined bijection whose inverse can also be defined inductively  If x is \\"pure infinite\\" with normal form where all , then  Similarly, for , the inverse is given by * Any surreal number can be written as the sum of a pure infinite, a real and an infinitesimal part, and the exponential is the product of the partial results given above  The normal form can be written out by multiplying the infinite part (a single power of œâ) and the real exponential into the power series resulting from the infinitesimal  Conversely, dividing out the leading term of the normal form will bring any surreal number into the form , for , where each factor has a form for which a way of calculating the logarithm has been given above; the sum is then the general logarithm * While there is no general inductive definition of log (unlike for exp), the partial results are given in terms of such definitions. In this way, the logarithm can be calculated explicitly, without reference to the fact that it's the inverse of the exponential. * The exponential function is much greater than any finite power  For any positive infinite x and any finite n, exp(x)/xn is infinite  For any integer n and surreal x > n2, exp(x) > xn. This stronger constraint is one of the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field * exp satisfies all the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field  The surreals with exponential is an elementary extension of the real exponential field  For ŒµŒ≤ an ordinal epsilon number, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than ŒµŒ≤ constitute a field that is closed under exponentials, and is likewise an elementary extension of the real exponential field =Examples= The surreal exponential is essentially given by its behaviour on positive powers of œâ, i.e., the function g(a), combined with well-known behaviour on finite numbers. Only examples of the former will be given. In addition, holds for a large part of its range, for instance for any finite number with positive real part and any infinite number that is less than some iterated power of œâ ( for some number of levels). * exp œâ = œâœâ * exp œâ1/œâ = œâ and log œâ = œâ1/œâ * exp (œâ ¬∑ log œâ) = exp (œâ ¬∑ œâ1/œâ) = œâœâ(1 + 1/œâ)  This shows that the \\"power of œâ\\" function is not compatible with exp, since compatibility would demand a value of œâœâ here * exp Œµ0 = œâœâŒµ0 \\\\+ 1 * log Œµ0 = Œµ0 / œâ =Exponentiation= A general exponentiation can be defined as , giving an interpretation to expressions like . Again it is essential to distinguish this definition from the \\"powers of œâ\\" function, especially if œâ may occur as the base.  Surcomplex numbers  A surcomplex number is a number of the form , where a and b are surreal numbers and is the square root of .Surreal vectors and the game of Cutblock, James Propp, August 22, 1994. The surcomplex numbers form an algebraically closed field (except for being a proper class), isomorphic to the algebraic closure of the field generated by extending the rational numbers by a proper class of algebraically independent transcendental elements. Up to field isomorphism, this fact characterizes the field of surcomplex numbers within any fixed set theory. Games The definition of surreal numbers contained one restriction: each element of L must be strictly less than each element of R. If this restriction is dropped we can generate a more general class known as games. All games are constructed according to this rule: :Construction Rule If L and R are two sets of games then { L R } is a game. Addition, negation, and comparison are all defined the same way for both surreal numbers and games. Every surreal number is a game, but not all games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game 0 } is not a surreal number. The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer properties of surreal numbers. The class of surreal numbers forms a field, but the class of games does not. The surreals have a total order: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one is greater than the other. The games have only a partial order: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other. Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero. Each game is either positive, negative, zero, or fuzzy (incomparable with zero, such as {1‚àí1}). A move in a game involves the player whose move it is choosing a game from those available in L (for the left player) or R (for the right player) and then passing this chosen game to the other player. A player who cannot move because the choice is from the empty set has lost. A positive game represents a win for the left player, a negative game for the right player, a zero game for the second player to move, and a fuzzy game for the first player to move. If x, y, and z are surreals, and x=y, then x z=y z. However, if x, y, and z are games, and x=y, then it is not always true that x z=y z. Note that \\"=\\" here means equality, not identity. Application to combinatorial game theory The surreal numbers were originally motivated by studies of the game Go, and there are numerous connections between popular games and the surreals. In this section, we will use a capitalized Game for the mathematical object {LR}, and the lowercase game for recreational games like Chess or Go. We consider games with these properties: * Two players (named Left and Right) * Deterministic (the game at each step will completely depend on the choices the players make, rather than a random factor) * No hidden information (such as cards or tiles that a player hides) * Players alternate taking turns (the game may or may not allow multiple moves in a turn) * Every game must end in a finite number of moves * As soon as there are no legal moves left for a player, the game ends, and that player loses For most games, the initial board position gives no great advantage to either player. As the game progresses and one player starts to win, board positions will occur in which that player has a clear advantage. For analyzing games, it is useful to associate a Game with every board position. The value of a given position will be the Game {LR}, where L is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Left. Similarly, R is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Right. The zero Game (called 0) is the Game where L and R are both empty, so the player to move next (L or R) immediately loses. The sum of two Games G = { L1 R1 } and H = { L2 R2 } is defined as the Game G + H = { L1 + H, G + L2 R1 + H, G + R2 } where the player to move chooses which of the Games to play in at each stage, and the loser is still the player who ends up with no legal move. One can imagine two chess boards between two players, with players making moves alternatively, but with complete freedom as to which board to play on. If G is the Game {L R}, -G is the game {-R -L}, i.e. with the role of the two players reversed. It is easy to show G - G = 0 for all Games G (where G - H is defined as G + (-H)). This simple way to associate Games with games yields a very interesting result. Suppose two perfect players play a game starting with a given position whose associated Game is x. We can classify all Games into four classes as follows: * If x > 0 then Left will win, regardless of who plays first. * If x < 0 then Right will win, regardless of who plays first. * If x = 0 then the player who goes second will win. * If x 0 then the player who goes first will win. More generally, we can define G > H as G - H > 0, and similarly for <, = and . The notation G H means that G and H are incomparable. G H is equivalent to G‚àíH 0, i.e. that G > H, G < H and G = H are all false. Incomparable games are sometimes said to be confused with each other, because one or the other may be preferred by a player depending on what is added to it. A game confused with zero is said to be fuzzy, as opposed to positive, negative, or zero. An example of a fuzzy game is star (*). Sometimes when a game nears the end, it will decompose into several smaller games that do not interact, except in that each player's turn allows moving in only one of them. For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until there are just a few small islands of empty space where a player can move. Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board. It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give an analysis of the entire game. This doesn't appear to be easy to do. For example, there might be two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it is no longer the first player who wins. Fortunately, there is a way to do this analysis. The following theorem can be applied: :If a big game decomposes into two smaller games, and the small games have associated Games of x and y, then the big game will have an associated Game of x+y. A game composed of smaller games is called the disjunctive sum of those smaller games, and the theorem states that the method of addition we defined is equivalent to taking the disjunctive sum of the addends. Historically, Conway developed the theory of surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here. He was analyzing Go endgames, and realized that it would be useful to have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their disjunctive sum. From this he invented the concept of a Game and the addition operator for it. From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison. Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers. Finally, he developed the multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals. Alternative realizations Alternative approaches to the surreal numbers complement Conway's exposition in terms of games. =Sign expansion= Definitions In what is now called the sign-expansion or sign-sequence of a surreal number, a surreal number is a function whose domain is an ordinal and whose codomain is { ‚àí1, +1 }. This is equivalent to Conway's L-R sequences. Define the binary predicate \\"simpler than\\" on numbers by x is simpler than y if x is a proper subset of y, i.e. if dom(x) < dom(y) and x(Œ±) = y(Œ±) for all Œ± < dom(x). For surreal numbers define the binary relation < to be lexicographic order (with the convention that \\"undefined values\\" are greater than ‚àí1 and less than 1). So x < y if one of the following holds: * x is simpler than y and y(dom(x)) = + 1; * y is simpler than x and x(dom(y)) = ‚àí 1; * there exists a number z such that z is simpler than x, z is simpler than y, x(dom(z)) = ‚àí 1 and y(dom(z)) = + 1. Equivalently, let Œ¥(x,y) = min({ dom(x), dom(y)} ‚à™ { Œ± : Œ± < dom(x) ‚àß Œ± < dom(y) ‚àß x(Œ±) ‚â† y(Œ±) }), so that x = y if and only if Œ¥(x,y) = dom(x) = dom(y). Then, for numbers x and y, x < y if and only if one of the following holds: * Œ¥(x,y) = dom(x) ‚àß Œ¥(x,y) < dom(y) ‚àß y(Œ¥(x,y)) = + 1; * Œ¥(x,y) < dom(x) ‚àß Œ¥(x,y) = dom(y) ‚àß x(Œ¥(x,y)) = ‚àí 1; * Œ¥(x,y) < dom(x) ‚àß Œ¥(x,y) < dom(y) ‚àß x(Œ¥(x,y)) = ‚àí 1 ‚àß y(Œ¥(x,y)) = + 1. For numbers x and y, x ‚â§ y if and only if x < y ‚à® x = y, and x > y if and only if y < x. Also x ‚â• y if and only if y ‚â§ x. The relation < is transitive, and for all numbers x and y, exactly one of x < y, x = y, x > y, holds (law of trichotomy). This means that < is a linear order (except that < is a proper class). For sets of numbers, L and R such that ‚àÄx ‚àà L ‚àÄy ‚àà R (x < y), there exists a unique number z such that * ‚àÄx ‚àà L (x < z) ‚àß ‚àÄy ‚àà R (z < y), * For any number w such that ‚àÄx ‚àà L (x < w) ‚àß ‚àÄy ‚àà R (w < y), w = z or z is simpler than w. Furthermore, z is constructible from L and R by transfinite induction. z is the simplest number between L and R. Let the unique number z be denoted by œÉ(L,R). For a number x, define its left set L(x) and right set R(x) by * L(x) = { xŒ± : Œ± < dom(x) ‚àß x(Œ±) = + 1 }; * R(x) = { xŒ± : Œ± < dom(x) ‚àß x(Œ±) = ‚àí 1 }, then œÉ(L(x),R(x)) = x. One advantage of this alternative realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway's realization of the surreal numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway's realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals. However, similar definitions can be made that eliminate the need for prior construction of the ordinals. For instance, we could let the surreals be the (recursively-defined) class of functions whose domain is a subset of the surreals satisfying the transitivity rule ‚àÄg ‚àà dom f (‚àÄh ‚àà dom g (h ‚àà dom f )) and whose range is { ‚àí, + }. \\"Simpler than\\" is very simply defined nowx is simpler than y if x ‚àà dom y. The total ordering is defined by considering x and y as sets of ordered pairs (as a function is normally defined): Either x = y, or else the surreal number z = x ‚à© y is in the domain of x or the domain of y (or both, but in this case the signs must disagree). We then have x < y if x(z) = ‚àí or y(z) = + (or both). Converting these functions into sign sequences is a straightforward task; arrange the elements of dom f in order of simplicity (i.e., inclusion), and then write down the signs that f assigns to each of these elements in order. The ordinals then occur naturally as those surreal numbers whose range is { + }. Addition and multiplication The sum x + y of two numbers, x and y, is defined by induction on dom(x) and dom(y) by x + y = œÉ(L,R), where * L = { u + y : u ‚àà L(x) } ‚à™{ x + v : v ‚àà L(y) }, * R = { u + y : u ‚àà R(x) } ‚à™{ x + v : v ‚àà R(y) }. The additive identity is given by the number 0 = { }, i.e. the number 0 is the unique function whose domain is the ordinal 0, and the additive inverse of the number x is the number ‚àí x, given by dom(‚àí x) = dom(x), and, for Œ± < dom(x), (‚àí x)(Œ±) = ‚àí 1 if x(Œ±) = + 1, and (‚àí x)(Œ±) = + 1 if x(Œ±) = ‚àí 1. It follows that a number x is positive if and only if 0 < dom(x) and x(0) = + 1, and x is negative if and only if 0 < dom(x) and x(0) = ‚àí 1. The product xy of two numbers, x and y, is defined by induction on dom(x) and dom(y) by xy = œÉ(L,R), where * L = { uy + xv ‚àí uv : u ‚àà L(x), v ‚àà L(y) } ‚à™ { uy + xv ‚àí uv : u ‚àà R(x), v ‚àà R(y) }, * R = { uy + xv ‚àí uv : u ‚àà L(x), v ‚àà R(y) } ‚à™ { uy + xv ‚àí uv : u ‚àà R(x), v ‚àà L(y) }. The multiplicative identity is given by the number 1 = { (0,+ 1) }, i.e. the number 1 has domain equal to the ordinal 1, and 1(0) = + 1. Correspondence with Conway's realization The map from Conway's realization to sign expansions is given by f({ L R }) = œÉ(M,S), where M = { f(x) : x ‚àà L } and S = { f(x) : x ‚àà R }. The inverse map from the alternative realization to Conway's realization is given by g(x) = { L R }, where L = { g(y) : y ‚àà L(x) } and R = { g(y) : y ‚àà R(x) }. =Axiomatic approach= In another approach to the surreals, given by Alling, explicit construction is bypassed altogether. Instead, a set of axioms is given that any particular approach to the surreals must satisfy. Much like the axiomatic approach to the reals, these axioms guarantee uniqueness up to isomorphism. A triple \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{No}, \\\\mathrm{<}, b \\\\rangle is a surreal number system if and only if the following hold: * < is a total order over No * b is a function from No onto the class of all ordinals (b is called the \\"birthday function\\" on No). * Let A and B be subclasses of No such that for all x ‚àà A and y ‚àà B, x < y (using Alling's terminology, „Äà A,B „Äâ is a \\"Conway cut\\" of No). Then there exists a unique z ‚àà No such that b(z) is minimal and for all x ‚àà A and all y ‚àà B, x < z < y. (This axiom is often referred to as \\"Conway's Simplicity Theorem\\".) * Furthermore, if an ordinal Œ± is greater than b(x) for all x ‚àà A, B, then b(z) ‚â§ Œ±. (Alling calls a system that satisfies this axiom a \\"full surreal number system\\".) Both Conway's original construction and the sign-expansion construction of surreals satisfy these axioms. Given these axioms, Alling derives Conway's original definition of ‚â§ and develops surreal arithmetic. =Simplicity hierarchy= A construction of the surreal numbers as a maximal binary pseudo-tree with simplicity (ancestor) and ordering relations is due to Philip Ehrlich, The difference from the usual definition of a tree is that the set of ancestors of a vertex is well-ordered, but may not have a maximal element (immediate predecessor); in other words the order type of that set is a general ordinal number, not just a natural number. This construction fulfills Alling's axioms as well and can easily be mapped to the sign-sequence representation. =Hahn series= Alling also proves that the field of surreal numbers is isomorphic (as an ordered field) to the field of Hahn series with real coefficients on the value group of surreal numbers themselves (the series representation corresponding to the normal form of a surreal number, as defined above). This provides a connection between surreal numbers and more conventional mathematical approaches to ordered field theory. This isomorphism makes the surreal numbers into a valued field where the valuation is the additive inverse of the exponent of the leading term in the Conway normal form, e.g., ŒΩ(œâ) = -1. The valuation ring then consists of the finite surreal numbers (numbers with a real and/or an infinitesimal part). The reason for the sign inversion is that the exponents in the Conway normal form constitute a reverse well-ordered set, whereas Hahn series are formulated in terms of (non-reversed) well-ordered subsets of the value group. Relation to hyperreals Philip Ehrlich has constructed an isomorphism between Conway's maximal surreal number field and the maximal hyperreals in von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory.

The study of hypercomplex numbers in the late 19th century forms the basis of modern group representation theory. History In the nineteenth century number systems called quaternions, tessarines, coquaternions, biquaternions, and octonions became established concepts in mathematical literature, added to the real and complex numbers. The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all, and called for a discipline to explain and classify them. The cataloguing project began in 1872 when Benjamin Peirce first published his Linear Associative Algebra, and was carried forward by his son Charles Sanders Peirce. Most significantly, they identified the nilpotent and the idempotent elements as useful hypercomplex numbers for classifications. The Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction used involutions to generate complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions out of the real number system. Hurwitz and Frobenius proved theorems that put limits on hypercomplexity: Hurwitz's theorem says finite-dimensional real composition algebras are the reals ‚Ñù, the complexes ‚ÑÇ, the quaternions ‚Ñç, and the octonions ùïÜ, and the Frobenius theorem says the only real associative division algebras are ‚Ñù, ‚ÑÇ, and ‚Ñç. In 1958 J. Frank Adams published a further generalization in terms of Hopf invariants on H-spaces which still limits the dimension to 1, 2, 4, or 8. It was matrix algebra that harnessed the hypercomplex systems. First, matrices contributed new hypercomplex numbers like 2 √ó 2 real matrices. Soon the matrix paradigm began to explain the others as they became represented by matrices and their operations. In 1907 Joseph Wedderburn showed that associative hypercomplex systems could be represented by matrices, or direct sums of systems of matrices.Emil Artin later generalized Wedderburn's result so it is known as the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem From that date the preferred term for a hypercomplex system became associative algebra as seen in the title of Wedderburn's thesis at University of Edinburgh. Note however, that non-associative systems like octonions and hyperbolic quaternions represent another type of hypercomplex number. As Hawkins explains, the hypercomplex numbers are stepping stones to learning about Lie groups and group representation theory. For instance, in 1929 Emmy Noether wrote on \\"hypercomplex quantities and representation theory\\". In 1973 Kantor and Solodovnikov published a textbook on hypercomplex numbers which was translated in 1989.Kantor, I.L., Solodownikow (1978), Hyperkomplexe Zahlen, BSB B.G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft, Leipzig Karen Parshall has written a detailed exposition of the heyday of hypercomplex numbers, including the role of such luminaries as Theodor Molien and Eduard Study. For the transition to modern algebra, Bartel van der Waerden devotes thirty pages to hypercomplex numbers in his History of Algebra. Definition A definition of a hypercomplex number is given by as an element of a finite-dimensional algebra over the real numbers that is unital but not necessarily associative or commutative. Elements are generated with real number coefficients (a_0, \\\\dots, a_n) for a basis \\\\\\\\{ 1, i_1, \\\\dots, i_n \\\\\\\\}. Where possible, it is conventional to choose the basis so that i_k^2 \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ -1, 0, +1 \\\\\\\\}. A technical approach to hypercomplex numbers directs attention first to those of dimension two. Two-dimensional real algebras Theorem: Up to isomorphism, there are exactly three 2-dimensional unital algebras over the reals: the ordinary complex numbers, the split-complex numbers, and the dual numbers. In particular, every 2-dimensional unital algebra over the reals is associative and commutative. Proof: Since the algebra is 2-dimensional, we can pick a basis {1, u}. Since the algebra is closed under squaring, the non-real basis element u squares to a linear combination of 1 and u: :u^2=a_0+a_1u for some real numbers a0 and a1. Using the common method of completing the square by subtracting a1u and adding the quadratic complement a / 4 to both sides yields :u^2-a_1u+\\\\frac{a_1^2}{4} = a_0+\\\\frac{a_1^2}{4}. Thus \\\\left(u-\\\\frac{a_1}{2}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\tilde{u}^2 where \\\\tilde{u}^2~=a_0 + \\\\frac{a_1^2}{4}. The three cases depend on this real value: * If , the above formula yields . Hence, ≈© can directly be identified with the nilpotent element \\\\epsilon of the basis \\\\\\\\{ 1, ~\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\} of the dual numbers. * If , the above formula yields . This leads to the split-complex numbers which have normalized basis \\\\\\\\{ 1 , ~j \\\\\\\\} with j^2 = +1. To obtain j from ≈©, the latter must be divided by the positive real number a:=\\\\sqrt{a_0+\\\\frac{a_1^2}{4}} which has the same square as ≈© has. * If , the above formula yields . This leads to the complex numbers which have normalized basis \\\\\\\\{ 1 , ~i \\\\\\\\} with i^2 = -1. To yield i from ≈©, the latter has to be divided by a positive real number a:=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_0} which squares to the negative of ≈©2. The complex numbers are the only 2-dimensional hypercomplex algebra that is a field. Algebras such as the split-complex numbers that include non-real roots of 1 also contain idempotents \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (1 \\\\pm j) and zero divisors (1 + j)(1 - j) = 0, so such algebras cannot be division algebras. However, these properties can turn out to be very meaningful, for instance in describing the Lorentz transformations of special relativity. In a 2004 edition of Mathematics Magazine the 2-dimensional real algebras have been styled the \\"generalized complex numbers\\". The idea of cross-ratio of four complex numbers can be extended to the 2-dimensional real algebras. Higher-dimensional examples (more than one non-real axis) =Clifford algebras= A Clifford algebra is the unital associative algebra generated over an underlying vector space equipped with a quadratic form. Over the real numbers this is equivalent to being able to define a symmetric scalar product, that can be used to orthogonalise the quadratic form, to give a basis such that: ::\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (e_i e_j + e_j e_i) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} -1, 0, +1 & i=j, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & i ot = j. \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. Imposing closure under multiplication generates a multivector space spanned by a basis of 2k elements, {1, e1, e2, e3, ..., e1e2, ..., e1e2e3, ...}. These can be interpreted as the basis of a hypercomplex number system. Unlike the basis {e1, ..., ek}, the remaining basis elements need not anti-commute, depending on how many simple exchanges must be carried out to swap the two factors. So , but . Putting aside the bases which contain an element ei such that (i.e. directions in the original space over which the quadratic form was degenerate), the remaining Clifford algebras can be identified by the label Clp,q(R), indicating that the algebra is constructed from p simple basis elements with , q with , and where R indicates that this is to be a Clifford algebra over the reals‚Äîi.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are to be real numbers. These algebras, called geometric algebras, form a systematic set, which turn out to be very useful in physics problems which involve rotations, phases, or spins, notably in classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory and relativity. Examples include: the complex numbers Cl0,1(R), split-complex numbers Cl1,0(R), quaternions Cl0,2(R), split-biquaternions Cl0,3(R), split- quaternions (the natural algebra of two-dimensional space); Cl3,0(R) (the natural algebra of three-dimensional space, and the algebra of the Pauli matrices); and the spacetime algebra Cl1,3(R). The elements of the algebra Clp,q(R) form an even subalgebra Cl(R) of the algebra Clq+1,p(R), which can be used to parametrise rotations in the larger algebra. There is thus a close connection between complex numbers and rotations in two-dimensional space; between quaternions and rotations in three-dimensional space; between split- complex numbers and (hyperbolic) rotations (Lorentz transformations) in 1+1-dimensional space, and so on. Whereas Cayley‚ÄìDickson and split-complex constructs with eight or more dimensions are not associative with respect to multiplication, Clifford algebras retain associativity at any number of dimensions. In 1995 Ian R. Porteous wrote on \\"The recognition of subalgebras\\" in his book on Clifford algebras. His Proposition 11.4 summarizes the hypercomplex cases: :Let A be a real associative algebra with unit element 1. Then :* 1 generates R (algebra of real numbers), :* any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element e0 of A such that is isomorphic to C (algebra of complex numbers), :* any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element e0 of A such that is isomorphic to 2R (algebra of split-complex numbers), :* any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = -1 is isomorphic to H (algebra of quaternions), :* any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = 1 is isomorphic to M2(R) (2 √ó 2 real matrices, coquaternions), :* any eight-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1, e2} of mutually anti-commuting elements of A such that e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = e_2 ^2 = -1 is isomorphic to 2H (split-biquaternions), :* any eight- dimensional subalgebra generated by a set {e0, e1, e2} of mutually anti- commuting elements of A such that e_0 ^2 = e_1 ^2 = e_2 ^2 = 1 is isomorphic to M2(C) ( complex matrices, biquaternions, Pauli algebra). For extension beyond the classical algebras, see Classification of Clifford algebras. =Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction= All of the Clifford algebras Clp,q(R) apart from the real numbers, complex numbers and the quaternions contain non-real elements that square to +1; and so cannot be division algebras. A different approach to extending the complex numbers is taken by the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction. This generates number systems of dimension 2n, n = 2, 3, 4, ..., with bases \\\\\\\\{1, i_1, \\\\dots, i_{2^n-1}\\\\\\\\}, where all the non-real basis elements anti-commute and satisfy i_m^2 = -1. In 8 or more dimensions () these algebras are non-associative. In 16 or more dimensions () these algebras also have zero-divisors. The first algebras in this sequence are the four- dimensional quaternions, eight-dimensional octonions, and 16-dimensional sedenions. An algebraic symmetry is lost with each increase in dimensionality: quaternion multiplication is not commutative, octonion multiplication is non- associative, and the norm of sedenions is not multiplicative. The Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction can be modified by inserting an extra sign at some stages. It then generates the \\"split algebras\\" in the collection of composition algebras instead of the division algebras: : split-complex numbers with basis \\\\\\\\{ 1, i_1 \\\\\\\\} satisfying \\\\ i_1^2 = +1, : split-quaternions with basis \\\\\\\\{ 1, i_1, i_2, i_3 \\\\\\\\} satisfying \\\\ i_1^2 = -1, i_2^2 = i_3^2 = +1, and : split-octonions with basis \\\\\\\\{ 1, i_1, \\\\dots, i_7 \\\\\\\\} satisfying \\\\ i_1^2 = i_2^2 = i_3^2 = -1, \\\\ i_4^2 = i_5^2 = i_6^2 = i_7^2 = +1 . Unlike the complex numbers, the split-complex numbers are not algebraically closed, and further contain nontrivial zero divisors and non-trivial idempotents. As with the quaternions, split-quaternions are not commutative, but further contain nilpotents; they are isomorphic to the 2 √ó 2 real matrices. Split-octonions are non-associative and contain nilpotents. =Tensor products= The tensor product of any two algebras is another algebra, which can be used to produce many more examples of hypercomplex number systems. In particular taking tensor products with the complex numbers (considered as algebras over the reals) leads to four-dimensional tessarines \\\\mathbb C\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\mathbb C, eight-dimensional biquaternions \\\\mathbb C\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\mathbb H, and 16-dimensional complex octonions \\\\mathbb C\\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\mathbb O. =Further examples= * bicomplex numbers: a 4-dimensional vector space over the reals, 2-dimensional over the complex numbers * multicomplex numbers: 2n‚àí1-dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers * composition algebra: algebra with a quadratic form that composes with the product See also * Sedenions * Thomas Kirkman * Georg Scheffers * Richard Brauer * Hypercomplex analysis References Further reading   . and Ouvres Completes T.2 pt. 1, pp 107‚Äì246.

Similarly, an element of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero such that . This is a partial case of divisibility in rings. An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor. An element that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero such that may be different from the nonzero such that ). If the ring is commutative, then the left and right zero divisors are the same. An element of a ring that is not a left zero divisor is called left regular or left cancellable. Similarly, an element of a ring that is not a right zero divisor is called right regular or right cancellable. An element of a ring that is left and right cancellable, and is hence not a zero divisor, is called regular or cancellable, or a non-zero-divisor. A zero divisor that is nonzero is called a nonzero zero divisor or a nontrivial zero divisor. If there are no nontrivial zero divisors in , then is a domain.  Examples  * In the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}/4\\\\mathbb{Z}, the residue class \\\\overline{2} is a zero divisor since \\\\overline{2} \\\\times \\\\overline{2}=\\\\overline{4}=\\\\overline{0}. * The only zero divisor of the ring \\\\mathbb{Z} of integers is 0. * A nilpotent element of a nonzero ring is always a two-sided zero divisor. * An idempotent element e e 1 of a ring is always a two-sided zero divisor, since e(1-e)=0=(1-e)e. * The ring of n \\\\times n matrices over a field has nonzero zero divisors if n \\\\geq 2. Examples of zero divisors in the ring of 2\\\\times 2 matrices (over any nonzero ring) are shown here: *:\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\\\\\\\\\2&2\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\\\\\\\\\1&-1\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}-2&1\\\\\\\\\\\\2&1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\\\\\\\\\2&2\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix} , *:\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{pmatrix} =\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix} =\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix}. *A direct product of two or more nonzero rings always has nonzero zero divisors. For example, in R_1 \\\\times R_2 with each R_i nonzero, (1,0)(0,1) = (0,0), so (1,0) is a zero divisor. =One- sided zero-divisor= *Consider the ring of (formal) matrices \\\\begin{pmatrix}x&y;\\\\\\\\\\\\0&z;\\\\end{pmatrix} with x,z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} and y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}.

If either of x,z is 0, then it is a two-sided zero-divisor. *Here is another example of a ring with an element that is a zero divisor on one side only. Let S be the set of all sequences of integers (a_1,a_2,a_3,...). Take for the ring all additive maps from S to S, with pointwise addition and composition as the ring operations. (That is, our ring is \\\\mathrm{End}(S), the endomorphism ring of the additive group S.) Three examples of elements of this ring are the right shift R(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(0,a_1,a_2,...), the left shift L(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(a_2,a_3,a_4,...), and the projection map onto the first factor P(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(a_1,0,0,...). All three of these additive maps are not zero, and the composites LP and PR are both zero, so L is a left zero divisor and R is a right zero divisor in the ring of additive maps from S to S. However, L is not a right zero divisor and R is not a left zero divisor: the composite LR is the identity. RL is a two-sided zero-divisor since RLP=0=PRL, while LR=1 is not in any direction.  Non-examples  * The ring of integers modulo a prime number has no zero divisors other than 0. Since every nonzero element is a unit, this ring is a finite field. * More generally, a division ring has no zero divisors except 0. * A nonzero commutative ring whose only zero divisor is 0 is called an integral domain.  Properties  * In the ring of -by- matrices over a field, the left and right zero divisors coincide; they are precisely the singular matrices. In the ring of -by- matrices over an integral domain, the zero divisors are precisely the matrices with determinant zero. * Left or right zero divisors can never be units, because if is invertible and , then for some nonzero . * An element is cancellable on the side on which it is regular. That is, if is a left regular, implies that , and similarly for right regular. Zero as a zero divisor There is no need for a separate convention regarding the case , because the definition applies also in this case: * If is a ring other than the zero ring, then is a (two-sided) zero divisor, because , where is a nonzero element of . * If is the zero ring, in which , then is not a zero divisor, because there is no nonzero element that when multiplied by yields . Such properties are needed in order to make the following general statements true: * In a commutative ring , the set of non-zero-divisors is a multiplicative set in . (This, in turn, is important for the definition of the total quotient ring.) The same is true of the set of non-left-zero-divisors and the set of non-right-zero- divisors in an arbitrary ring, commutative or not. * In a commutative Noetherian ring , the set of zero divisors is the union of the associated prime ideals of .

Proved by Kuratowski in 1922 and independently by Zorn in 1935, this lemma occurs in the proofs of several theorems of crucial importance, for instance the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem in functional analysis, the theorem that every vector space has a basis, Tychonoff's theorem in topology stating that every product of compact spaces is compact, and the theorems in abstract algebra that in a ring with identity every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal and that every field has an algebraic closure. Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem and also to the axiom of choice, in the sense that any one of the three, together with the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axioms of set theory, is sufficient to prove the other two. An earlier formulation of Zorn's lemma is Hausdorff's maximum principle which states that every totally ordered subset of a given partially ordered set is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset of that partially ordered set. Motivation Sometimes one wants to prove the existence of a mathematical object (which can be viewed as a maximal element in some poset). One could try proving the existence of such an object by assuming there is no maximal element and using transfinite induction and the assumptions of the situation to get a contradiction. Zorn's lemma tidies up the conditions a situation needs to satisfy in order for such an argument to work. Therefore Zorn's lemma enables mathematicians to not have to repeat the transfinite induction argument by hand each time, but just check the conditions of Zorn's lemma. Statement of the lemma Zorn's lemma can be stated as: Variants of this formulation are sometimes used, such as requiring that the set P and the chains be non-empty. See the discussion below. Example application Zorn's lemma can be used to show that every nontrivial ring R with unity contains a maximal ideal. In the terminology above, the set P consists of all (two-sided) ideals in R except R itself. Since R is non- trivial, the set P contains the trivial ideal {0}, and therefore P is non- empty. This set P is partially ordered by set inclusion. Finding a maximal ideal is the same as finding a maximal element in P. The ideal R was excluded because maximal ideals by definition are not equal to R. To apply Zorn's lemma, take a chain T in P (that is, T is a subset of P that is totally ordered). If T is the empty set, then the trivial ideal {0} is an upper bound for T in P. Assume then that T is non-empty. It is necessary to show that T has an upper bound, that is, there exists an ideal I ‚äÜ R which is bigger than all members of T but still smaller than R (otherwise it would not be in P). Take I to be the union of all the ideals in T. We wish to show that I is an upper bound for T in P. We will first show that I is an ideal of R, and then that it is a proper ideal of R and so is an element of P. Since every element of T is contained in I, this will show that I is an upper bound for T in P, as required. Because T contains at least one element, and that element contains at least 0, the union I contains at least 0 and is not empty. To prove that I is an ideal, note that if a and b are elements of I, then there exist two ideals J, K ‚àà T such that a is an element of J and b is an element of K. Since T is totally ordered, we know that J ‚äÜ K or K ‚äÜ J. In the first case, both a and b are members of the ideal K, therefore their sum a + b is a member of K, which shows that a + b is a member of I. In the second case, both a and b are members of the ideal J, and thus a + b ‚àà I. Furthermore, if r ‚àà R, then ar and ra are elements of J and hence elements of I. Thus, I is an ideal in R. Now, an ideal is equal to R if and only if it contains 1. (It is clear that if it is equal to R, then it must contain 1; on the other hand, if it contains 1 and r is an arbitrary element of R, then r1 = r is an element of the ideal, and so the ideal is equal to R.) So, if I were equal to R, then it would contain 1, and that means one of the members of T would contain 1 and would thus be equal to R ‚Äì but R is explicitly excluded from P. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in P, in other words a maximal ideal in R. Note that the proof depends on the fact that our ring R has a multiplicative unit 1. Without this, the proof wouldn't work and indeed the statement would be false. For example, the ring with \\\\Q as additive group and trivial multiplication (i.e. a b=0 for all a,b) has no maximal ideal (and of course no 1): Its ideals are precisely the additive subgroups. The factor group \\\\Q/A by a proper subgroup A is a divisible group, hence certainly not finitely generated, hence has a proper non-trivial subgroup, which gives rise to a subgroup and ideal containing A. Proof sketch A sketch of the proof of Zorn's lemma follows, assuming the axiom of choice. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, P such that every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and that for every element in P there is another element bigger than it. For every totally ordered subset T we may then define a bigger element b(T), because T has an upper bound, and that upper bound has a bigger element. To actually define the function b, we need to employ the axiom of choice. Using the function b, we are going to define elements a0 < a1 < a2 < a3 < ... in P. This sequence is really long: the indices are not just the natural numbers, but all ordinals. In fact, the sequence is too long for the set P; there are too many ordinals (a proper class), more than there are elements in any set, and the set P will be exhausted before long and then we will run into the desired contradiction. The ai are defined by transfinite recursion: we pick a0 in P arbitrary (this is possible, since P contains an upper bound for the empty set and is thus not empty) and for any other ordinal w we set aw = b({av : v < w}). Because the av are totally ordered, this is a well-founded definition. This proof shows that actually a slightly stronger version of Zorn's lemma is true: Alternative formulation Zorn's lemma is sometimesFor example, , , and . stated as follows: Although this formulation appears to be formally weaker (since it places on P the additional condition of being non-empty, but obtains the same conclusion about P), in fact the two formulations are equivalent. To verify this, suppose first that P satisfies the condition that every chain in P has an upper bound in P. Then the empty subset of P is a chain, as it satisfies the definition vacuously; so the hypothesis implies that this subset must have an upper bound in P, and this upper bound shows that P is in fact non-empty. Conversely, if P is assumed to be non-empty and satisfies the hypothesis that every non-empty chain has an upper bound in P, then P also satisfies the condition that every chain has an upper bound, as an arbitrary element of P serves as an upper bound for the empty chain (that is, the empty subset viewed as a chain). The difference may seem subtle, but in many proofs that invoke Zorn's lemma one takes unions of some sort to produce an upper bound, and so the case of the empty chain may be overlooked; that is, the verification that all chains have upper bounds may have to deal with empty and non-empty chains separately. So many authors prefer to verify the non-emptiness of the set P rather than deal with the empty chain in the general argument. History The Hausdorff maximal principle is an early statement similar to Zorn's lemma. Kazimierz Kuratowski proved in 1922 a version of the lemma close to its modern formulation (it applies to sets ordered by inclusion and closed under unions of well-ordered chains). Essentially the same formulation (weakened by using arbitrary chains, not just well-ordered) was independently given by Max Zorn in 1935, who proposed it as a new axiom of set theory replacing the well- ordering theorem, exhibited some of its applications in algebra, and promised to show its equivalence with the axiom of choice in another paper, which never appeared. The name \\"Zorn's lemma\\" appears to be due to John Tukey, who used it in his book Convergence and Uniformity in Topology in 1940. Bourbaki's Th√©orie des Ensembles of 1939 refers to a similar maximal principle as \\"le th√©or√®me de Zorn\\".. The name \\"Kuratowski‚ÄìZorn lemma\\" prevails in Poland and Russia. Equivalent forms of Zorn's lemma Zorn's lemma is equivalent (in ZF) to three main results: # Hausdorff maximal principle # Axiom of choice # Well- ordering theorem. A well-known joke alluding to this equivalency (which may defy human intuition) is attributed to Jerry Bona: \\"The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?\\". Zorn's lemma is also equivalent to the strong completeness theorem of first-order logic.J.L. Bell & A.B. Slomson (1969). Models and Ultraproducts. North Holland Publishing Company. Chapter 5, Theorem 4.3, page 103. Moreover, Zorn's lemma (or one of its equivalent forms) implies some major results in other mathematical areas. For example, # Banach's extension theorem which is used to prove one of the most fundamental results in functional analysis, the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem # Every vector space has a basis, a result from linear algebra (to which it is equivalent). In particular, the real numbers, as a vector space over the rational numbers, possess a Hamel basis. # Every commutative unital ring has a maximal ideal, a result from ring theory # Tychonoff's theorem in topology (to which it is also equivalent) # Every proper filter is contained in an ultrafilter, a result that yields completeness theorem of first-order logicJ.L. Bell & A.B. Slomson (1969). Models and Ultraproducts. North Holland Publishing Company. In this sense, we see how Zorn's lemma can be seen as a powerful tool, especially in the sense of unified mathematics. = Analogs under weakenings of the axiom of choice = A weakened form of Zorn's lemma can be proven from ZF + DC (Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice replaced by the axiom of dependent choice). Zorn's lemma can be expressed straightforwardly by observing that the set having no maximal element would be equivalent to stating that the set's ordering relation would be entire, which would allow us to apply the axiom of dependent choice to construct a countable chain. As a result, any partially ordered set with exclusively finite chains must have a maximal element. More generally, strengthening the axiom of dependent choice to higher ordinals allows us to generalize the statement in the previous paragraph to higher cardinalities. In the limit where we allow arbitrarily large ordinals, we recover the proof of the full Zorn's lemma using the axiom of choice in the preceding section. In popular culture The 1970 film, Zorns Lemma, is named after the lemma. This lemma was referenced on The Simpsons in the episode \\"Bart's New Friend\\".

The graph of the winding number of the circle map is an example of a singular function. In mathematics, a real-valued function f on the interval [a, b] is said to be singular if it has the following properties: *f is continuous on [a, b]. () *there exists a set N of measure 0 such that for all x outside of N the derivative f ‚Ä≤(x) exists and is zero, that is, the derivative of f vanishes almost everywhere. *f is non-constant on [a, b]. A standard example of a singular function is the Cantor function, which is sometimes called the devil's staircase (a term also used for singular functions in general). There are, however, other functions that have been given that name. One is defined in terms of the circle map. If f(x) = 0 for all x ‚â§ a and f(x) = 1 for all x ‚â• b, then the function can be taken to represent a cumulative distribution function for a random variable which is neither a discrete random variable (since the probability is zero for each point) nor an absolutely continuous random variable (since the probability density is zero everywhere it exists). Singular functions occur, for instance, as sequences of spatially modulated phases or structures in solids and magnets, described in a prototypical fashion by the Frenkel‚ÄìKontorova model and by the ANNNI model, as well as in some dynamical systems. Most famously, perhaps, they lie at the center of the fractional quantum Hall effect. When referring to functions with a singularity When discussing mathematical analysis in general, or more specifically real analysis or complex analysis or differential equations, it is common for a function which contains a mathematical singularity to be referred to as a 'singular function'. This is especially true when referring to functions which diverge to infinity at a point or on a boundary. For example, one might say, \\"1/x becomes singular at the origin, so 1/x is a singular function.\\" Advanced techniques for working with functions that contain singularities have been developed in the subject called distributional or generalized function analysis.

Neither the application programming interface (API) nor the interpreter to execute AutoLISP code are included in the AutoCAD LT product line. Features AutoLISP is a small, dynamically scoped, dynamically typed Lisp language dialect with garbage collection, immutable list structure, and settable symbols, lacking in such regular Lisp features as macro system, records definition facilities, arrays, functions with variable number of arguments or let bindings. Aside from the core language, most of the primitive functions are for geometry, accessing AutoCAD's internal DWG database, or manipulation of graphical entities in AutoCAD. The properties of these graphical entities are revealed to AutoLISP as association lists in which values are paired with AutoCAD group codes that indicate properties such as definitional points, radii, colors, layers, linetypes, etc. AutoCAD loads AutoLISP code from .LSP files. AutoLISP code can interact with the user through AutoCAD's graphical editor by use of primitive functions that allow the user to pick points, choose objects on screen, and input numbers and other data. AutoLisp also has a built-in graphical user interface (GUI) mini- or domain-specific language (DSL), the Dialog Control Language, for creating modal dialog boxes with automated layout, within AutoCAD. History AutoLISP was derived from an early version of XLISP, which was created by David Betz. The language was introduced in AutoCAD Version 2.18 in January 1986, and continued to be enhanced in successive releases up to release 13 in February 1995. After that, its development was neglected by Autodesk in favor of more fashionable development environments like Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), .NET Framework, and ObjectARX. However, it has remained AutoCAD's main user customizing language. Vital-LISP, a considerably enhanced version of AutoLISP including an integrated development environment (IDE), debugger, compiler, and ActiveX support, was developed and sold by third party developer Basis Software. Vital LISP was a superset of the existing AutoLISP language that added VBA-like access to the AutoCAD object model, reactors (event handling for AutoCAD objects), general ActiveX support, and some other general Lisp functions. Autodesk purchased this, renamed it Visual LISP, and briefly sold it as an add-on to AutoCAD release 14 released in May 1997. It was incorporated into AutoCAD 2000 released in March 1999, as a replacement for AutoLISP. Since then, Autodesk has ceased major enhancements to Visual LISP and focused more effort on VBA and .NET, and C++. , Autodesk no longer supports VBA versions older than 7.1. This is part of a long-term process of changing from VBA to .NET for user customizing. AutoLISP has such a strong following that other computer-aided design (CAD) application vendors add it to their products. Bricscad, IntelliCAD, DraftSight and others have AutoLISP functionality, so that AutoLISP users can consider using them as an alternative to AutoCAD. Most development involving AutoLISP since AutoCAD 2000 is performed within Visual LISP since the original AutoLISP engine was replaced with the Visual LISP engine. There are thousands of utilities and applications that have been developed using AutoLISP or Visual LISP (distributed as LSP, FAS and VLX files). Examples A simple Hello world program in AutoLISP would be: (defun hello ( ) (princ \\" Hello World!\\") (princ) ) Note the final line inside the function definition: when evaluated with no arguments, the \`princ\` function returns a null symbol, which is not displayed by the AutoCAD command-line interface. As the AutoCAD command line functions as a read‚Äìeval‚Äìprint loop (REPL), this would normally print \\"Hello World!\\" to the command line, followed immediately by the return value of the call to \`princ\`. Therefore, without the final call to the \`princ\` function, the result of this would be: :\`Hello World!\\" Hello World!\\"\` The \`prin1\` function may also be used to achieve the same result. A more complex example might be: (defun c:pointlabel ( / pnt ) (if (setq pnt (getpoint \\" Specify point: \\")) (progn (entmake (list '(0 . \\"POINT\\") (cons 10 (trans pnt 1 0)) ) ) (entmake (list '(0 . \\"TEXT\\") (cons 10 (trans (cons (+ (car pnt) 0.6) (cdr pnt)) 1 0)) (cons 40 (getvar 'textsize)) (cons 1 (strcat \\"X:\\" (rtos (car pnt)) \\" Y:\\" (rtos (cadr pnt)))) ) ) ) ) (princ) ) The above code defines a new function which generates an AutoCAD point object at a given point, with a one- line text object displaying the X and Y coordinates beside it. The name of the function includes a special prefix 'c:', which causes AutoCAD to recognize the function as a regular command. The user, upon typing 'pointlabel' at the AutoCAD command line, would be prompted to pick a point, either by typing the X and Y coordinates, or clicking a location in the drawing. The function would then place a marker at that point, and create a one-line text object next to it, containing the X and Y coordinates of the point expressed relative to the active User Coordinate System (UCS). The function requires no parameters, and contains one local variable ('pnt'). The above example could also be written using built-in AutoCAD commands to achieve the same result, however this approach is susceptible to changes to the command prompts between AutoCAD releases.

Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado; much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains; and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. It joins the North Platte River in western Nebraska to form the Platte, which then flows across Nebraska to the Missouri. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. In its valley along the foothills in Colorado, it has permitted agriculture in an area of the Colorado Piedmont and Great Plains that is otherwise arid. Description The river is formed in Park County, Colorado, southwest of Denver in the South Park grassland basin by the confluence of the South Fork and Middle Fork, approximately southeast of Fairplay. Both forks rise along the eastern flank of the Mosquito Range, on the western side of South Park, which is drained by the tributaries at the headwaters of the river. From South Park, it passes through of the Platte Canyon and its lower section, Waterton Canyon. Here, it is joined by the North Fork before emerging from the foothills southwest of the Denver suburb of Littleton. At Littleton, the river is impounded to form Chatfield Reservoir, a flood-control basin for the Denver Metropolitan Area. The river flows north through central Denver, which was founded along its banks at its confluence with Cherry Creek. The valley through Denver is highly industrialized, serving generally as the route for both the railroad lines, as well as Interstate 25. On the north side of Denver it is joined somewhat inconspicuously by Clear Creek, which descends from the mountains to the west in a canyon that was the cradle of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. North of Denver it flows through the agricultural heartland of the Piedmont (a shale region that was formed through erosion by the ancestor of the river following the creation of the Rockies). It flows directly past the communities of Brighton and Fort Lupton, and is joined in succession by Saint Vrain Creek, the Little Thompson River, the Big Thompson River, and the Cache la Poudre River, which it receives just east of Greeley. East of Greeley it turns eastward, flowing across the Colorado Eastern Plains, past Fort Morgan and Brush, where it turns northeastward. It continues past Sterling, and runs into Nebraska between Julesburg, Colorado and Big Springs, Nebraska. In Nebraska, it passes south of Ogallala and joins the North Platte River near the city of North Platte. The South Platte River through Denver is on the U.S. EPA's list of impaired waterbodies for pathogen impairment, with E. coli as the representative pathogen species. Other water issues involve the appearance of the New Zealand Mud Snail and of the Zebra Mussel. History The South Platte was originally called Niin√©niiniic√≠ih√©he by the native Arapaho people who lived on its banks. The early Spanish explorers called it the Rio Chato (calm river). In 1702, it was named the Rio Jesus Maria by Captain Jose Lopez, the Tewa Irish scout and Captain of War of the New Mexico Indian Auxiliaries who was ordered by the Viceroy of New Spain to search the Tierra Incognita for a French incursion into New Mexico.Nebraska: A Guide to the Cornhusker State. Nebraska State Historical Society. p. 46. The South Platte River also served as a vital water source in Colorado. Long before the city of Denver was created many travelers came to the South Platte River to escape the arid Great Plains. These people could survive the heat but not without the vital water source that the South Platte River gave them. Buckets and wells sufficed as a water system for a while but eventually the Denver Water System was created.Denver Water History . Accessed June 23, 2014. Dams In an arid region of the United States, the South Platte is marked with several dams. The first notable water impoundment on the South Platte is Antero Reservoir. \\"Antero\\" is derived from the Spanish word \\"first,\\" as it was the first dam on the South Platte River near the river's origin. The next dam is Spinney Mountain Reservoir. At capacity Spinney Mountain covers . A bottom release dam, Spinney releases to the east of the inlet. Two miles below Spinney Mountain Reservoir, the river enters Eleven Mile Reservoir, with a capacity of . The Eleven Mile Reservoir Dam drains into Eleven Mile Canyon, which runs through Forest Service land. Under the reservoir are three former Colorado towns, Howbert, Idlewild, and Freshwater Station, which were submerged to meet the water needs of Denver.Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Forty-Six Years in Howbert: 1887-1933: Former Ranching, Railroading Community Covered by Eleven-Mile Reservoir\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 97-104. From Eleven Mile Canyon, the South Platte runs northeast to Cheesman Reservoir, named for Denver water pioneer Walter S. Cheesman. At its completion in 1905, the dam was the world's tallest, at above the streambed. The reservoir and related facilities were purchased in November 1918 by the Denver Water Board. Cheesman was the first reservoir of Denver's mountain storage facilities and has been designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Cheesman Reservoir feeds Cheesman Canyon. Six miles below Cheesman Reservoir is the town of Deckers; there, the river bends north for approximately to the confluence with the North Fork of the South Platte. In the late 1980s, a proposal was put forth for the Two Forks Dam, which would have created a reservoir flooding the entire section from the North Fork confluence to the town of Deckers. In 1990 the Environmental Protection Agency vetoed the permit, calling the project an \\"environmental catastrophe.\\" From the confluence, the river flows towards Denver and enters Strontia Springs Reservoir. Below Strontia Springs the South Platte runs through Waterton Canyon before entering Chatfield Reservoir. Chatfield marks the seventh and final dam on the South Platte until it merges with the North Platte. Fly fishing overview The South Platte River is a Gold Medal Western trout river on the Eastern Slope of Colorado. The river is well known for its wild trophy population of Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout. As a result of the close proximity to Denver, the river sees thousands of fly fishing enthusiasts each year. With seven dams on the river, the South Platte is considered a tailwater fishery. Most of these dams are bottom released which allow for both stable water temperatures throughout the year, and year-round fly fishing. Popular fly fishing stretches of the river include Waterton Canyon, Deckers, Cheesman Canyon and the Dream Stream.

A machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.

They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage. Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.

This meaning is found in late medieval French, and is adopted from the French into English in the mid-16th century. In the 17th century, the word machine could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived machination. The modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to stage engines used in theater and to military siege engines, both in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The OED traces the formal, modern meaning to John Harris' Lexicon Technicum (1704), which has: :Machine, or Engine, in Mechanicks, is whatsoever hath Force sufficient either to raise or stop the Motion of a Body. Simple Machines are commonly reckoned to be Six in Number, viz. the Ballance, Leaver, Pulley, Wheel, Wedge, and Screw. Compound Machines, or Engines, are innumerable.

History Flint hand axe found in Winchester. The hand axe, made by chipping flint to form a wedge, in the hands of a human transforms force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting forces and movement of the workpiece. The hand axe is the first example of a wedge, the oldest of the six classic simple machines, from which most machines are based. The second oldest simple machine was the inclined plane (ramp),Karl von Langsdorf (1826) Machinenkunde, quoted in which has been used since prehistoric times to move heavy objects.Therese McGuire, Light on Sacred Stones, in The other four simple machines were invented in the ancient Near East. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water- lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza. Three of the simple machines were studied and described by Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC: the lever, pulley and screw. Archimedes discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandria (ca. 10‚Äì75 AD) in his work Mechanics lists five mechanisms that can \\"set a load in motion\\"; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However, the Greeks' understanding was limited to statics (the balance of forces) and did not include dynamics (the tradeoff between force and distance) or the concept of work. The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC. The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.Ahmad Y Hassan, Donald Routledge Hill (1986).

(See ) and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls. The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al- Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.Professor Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari, was the first programmable analog computer.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184, University of Texas Press, Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64‚Äì9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) During the Renaissance, the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (\\"On Mechanics\\"). He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, they merely transform it. The classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). James Watt patented his parallel motion linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical.Pennock, G. R., James Watt (1736-1819), Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science, ed. M. Ceccarelli, Springer, 2007, (Print) 978-1-4020-6366-4 (Online). The Boulton and Watt steam engine and later designs powered steam locomotives, steam ships, and factories. The Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and eventually the rest of the world. Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal-based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal.  Simple machines  Table of simple mechanisms, from Chambers' Cyclop√¶dia, 1728.. Simple machines provide a \\"vocabulary\\" for understanding more complex machines. The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane. The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints. Wedge (hand axe): Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also called biface and Olorgesailie. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece. The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement. This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed. For a wedge this is given by 1/tanŒ±, where Œ± is the tip angle. The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or prismatic joint. Lever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power. This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum. Because the velocity of a point farther from the pivot is greater than the velocity of a point near the pivot, forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the associated decrease in speed. If a is the distance from the pivot to the point where the input force is applied and b is the distance to the point where the output force is applied, then a/b is the mechanical advantage of the lever. The fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or revolute joint. Wheel: The wheel is an important early machine, such as the chariot. A wheel uses the law of the lever to reduce the force needed to overcome friction when pulling a load. To see this notice that the friction associated with pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel. However, the wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the frictional resistance in the bearing. The Kinematics of Machinery, 1876 The classification of simple machines to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines.Moon, F. C., The Reuleaux Collection of Kinematic Mechanisms at Cornell University, 1999 He recognized that the classical simple machines can be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are similarly a block sliding on a flat surface.Hartenberg, R.S. & J. Denavit (1964) Kinematic synthesis of linkages , New York: McGraw-Hill, online link from Cornell University. Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint. This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting with four types of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a mechanism . Two levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar four-bar linkage by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another. Additional links can be attached to form a six-bar linkage or in series to form a robot. Mechanical systems The Boulton & Watt Steam Engine, 1784 A mechanical system manages power to accomplish a task that involves forces and movement. Modern machines are systems consisting of (i) a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, (ii) a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, (iii) a controller with sensors that compare the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input, and (iv) an interface to an operator consisting of levers, switches, and displays. This can be seen in Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston. The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley. Finally, the pulley rotation drives the flyball governor which controls the valve for the steam input to the piston cylinder. The adjective \\"mechanical\\" refers to skill in the practical application of an art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces, properties or agents such as is dealt with by mechanics. Similarly Merriam- Webster DictionaryMerriam-Webster Dictionary Definition of mechanical defines \\"mechanical\\" as relating to machinery or tools. Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems. The German mechanician Franz ReuleauxReuleaux, F., 1876 The Kinematics of Machinery (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963) wrote, \\"a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion.\\" Notice that forces and motion combine to define power. More recently, Uicker et al.J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, Theory of Machines and Mechanisms, Oxford University Press, New York. stated that a machine is \\"a device for applying power or changing its direction.\\" McCarthy and SohJ. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, Geometric Design of Linkages, Springer, New York. describe a machine as a system that \\"generally consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power.\\"  Power sources  Diesel engine, friction clutch and gear transmission of an automobile. Early Ganz Electric Generator in Zwevegem, West Flanders, Belgium Human and animal effort were the original power sources for early machines. Waterwheel: Waterwheels appeared around the world around 300 BC to use flowing water to generate rotary motion, which was applied to milling grain, and powering lumber, machining and textile operations. Modern water turbines use water flowing through a dam to drive an electric generator. Windmill: Early windmills captured wind power to generate rotary motion for milling operations. Modern wind turbines also drives a generator. This electricity in turn is used to drive motors forming the actuators of mechanical systems. Engine: The word engine derives from \\"ingenuity\\" and originally referred to contrivances that may or may not be physical devices. See Merriam-Webster's definition of engine. A steam engine uses heat to boil water contained in a pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine. This principle can be seen in the aeolipile of Hero of Alexandria. This is called an external combustion engine. An automobile engine is called an internal combustion engine because it burns fuel (an exothermic chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a piston. A jet engine uses a turbine to compress air which is burned with fuel so that it expands through a nozzle to provide thrust to an aircraft, and so is also an \\"internal combustion engine.\\" \\"Internal combustion engine\\", Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, Third Edition, Sybil P. Parker, ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1994, p. 998 . Power plant: The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a boiler generates steam that drives a steam turbine to rotate an electric generator. A nuclear power plant uses heat from a nuclear reactor to generate steam and electric power. This power is distributed through a network of transmission lines for industrial and individual use. Motors: Electric motors use either AC or DC electric current to generate rotational movement. Electric servomotors are the actuators for mechanical systems ranging from robotic systems to modern aircraft. Fluid Power: Hydraulic and pneumatic systems use electrically driven pumps to drive water or air respectively into cylinders to power linear movement.  Mechanisms  The mechanism of a mechanical system is assembled from components called machine elements. These elements provide structure for the system and control its movement. The structural components are, generally, the frame members, bearings, splines, springs, seals, fasteners and covers. The shape, texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users. The assemblies that control movement are also called \\"mechanisms.\\"J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, Theory of Machines and Mechanisms, Oxford University Press, New York. Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, which includes belt drives and chain drives, cam and follower mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms, escapements and friction devices such as brakes and clutches. The number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism, or its mobility, depends on the number of links and joints and the types of joints used to construct the mechanism. The general mobility of a mechanism is the difference between the unconstrained freedom of the links and the number of constraints imposed by the joints. It is described by the Chebychev-Gr√ºbler-Kutzbach criterion. = Gears and gear trains = The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment) The transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. Illustrations by the renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the involute tooth yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio. Some important features of gears and gear trains are: * The ratio of the pitch circles of mating gears defines the speed ratio and the mechanical advantage of the gear set. * A planetary gear train provides high gear reduction in a compact package. * It is possible to design gear teeth for gears that are non- circular, yet still transmit torque smoothly. * The speed ratios of chain and belt drives are computed in the same way as gear ratios. See bicycle gearing. = Cam and follower mechanisms = A cam and follower is formed by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the cam and follower determines the movement of the mechanism. = Linkages = Schematic of the actuator and four-bar linkage that position an aircraft landing gear. A linkage is a collection of links connected by joints. Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement. Perhaps the single most useful example is the planar four-bar linkage. However, there are many more special linkages: * Watt's linkage is a four-bar linkage that generates an approximate straight line. It was critical to the operation of his design for the steam engine. This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels. Also see the article Parallel motion. * The success of Watt's linkage lead to the design of similar approximate straight-line linkages, such as Hoeken's linkage and Chebyshev's linkage. * The Peaucellier linkage generates a true straight-line output from a rotary input. * The Sarrus linkage is a spatial linkage that generates straight-line movement from a rotary input. Select this link for an animation of the Sarrus linkage * The Klann linkage and the Jansen linkage are recent inventions that provide interesting walking movements. They are respectively a six-bar and an eight- bar linkage. =Planar mechanism= A planar mechanism is a mechanical system that is constrained so the trajectories of points in all the bodies of the system lie on planes parallel to a ground plane. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system are perpendicular to this ground plane. =Spherical mechanism= A spherical mechanism is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system pass through the center of these circle. =Spatial mechanism= A spatial mechanism is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals. = Flexure mechanisms = A flexure mechanism consists of a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements (also known as flexure joints) that is designed to produce a geometrically well-defined motion upon application of a force. Machine elements The elementary mechanical components of a machine are termed machine elements. These elements consist of three basic types (i) structural components such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants, (ii) mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and (iii) control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.Robert L. Norton, Machine Design, (4th Edition), Prentice-Hall, 2010 While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users. =Structural components= A number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals. * The recognition that the frame of a mechanism is an important machine element changed the name three-bar linkage into four-bar linkage. Frames are generally assembled from truss or beam elements. * Bearings are components designed to manage the interface between moving elements and are the source of friction in machines. In general, bearings are designed for pure rotation or straight line movement. * Splines and keys are two ways to reliably mount an axle to a wheel, pulley or gear so that torque can be transferred through the connection. * Springs provides forces that can either hold components of a machine in place or acts as a suspension to support part of a machine. * Seals are used between mating parts of a machine to ensure fluids, such as water, hot gases, or lubricant do not leak between the mating surfaces. * Fasteners such as screws, bolts, spring clips, and rivets are critical to the assembly of components of a machine. Fasteners are generally considered to be removable. In contrast, joining methods, such as welding, soldering, crimping and the application of adhesives, usually require cutting the parts to disassemble the components  Controllers  Controllers combine sensors, logic, and actuators to maintain the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the flyball governor for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such as the cruise control system in an automobile. The programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. Servomotors that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible.  Computing machines  Arithmometre, designed by Charles Xavier Thomas, c. 1820, for the four rules of arithmetic, manufactured 1866-1870 AD. Exhibit in the Tekniska museet, Stockholm, Sweden. Charles Babbage designed machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837. His Difference engine can be considered an advanced mechanical calculator and his Analytical Engine a forerunner of the modern computer, though none were built in Babbage's lifetime. The Arithmometer and the Comptometer are mechanical computers that are precursors to modern digital computers. Models used to study modern computers are termed State machine and Turing machine.  Molecular machines  A ribosome is a biological machine that utilizes protein dynamics The biological molecule myosin reacts to ATP and ADP to alternately engage with an actin filament and change its shape in a way that exerts a force, and then disengage to reset its shape, or conformation. This acts as the molecular drive that causes muscle contraction. Similarly the biological molecule kinesin has two sections that alternately engage and disengage with microtubules causing the molecule to move along the microtubule and transport vesicles within the cell, and dynein, which moves cargo inside cells towards the nucleus and produces the axonemal beating of motile cilia and flagella. \\"In effect, the motile cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines. Flexible linkers allow the mobile protein domains connected by them to recruit their binding partners and induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics. \\" Other biological machines are responsible for energy production, for example ATP synthase which harnesses energy from proton gradients across membranes to drive a turbine-like motion used to synthesise ATP, the energy currency of a cell. Still other machines are responsible for gene expression, including DNA polymerases for replicating DNA, RNA polymerases for producing mRNA, the spliceosome for removing introns, and the ribosome for synthesising proteins. These machines and their nanoscale dynamics are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been artificially constructed. These molecules are increasingly considered to be nanomachines. Researchers have used DNA to construct nano-dimensioned four-bar linkages.Marras, A., Zhou, L., Su, H., and Castro, C.E. Programmable motion of DNA origami mechanisms, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2015 McCarthy, C, DNA Origami Mechanisms and Machines Mechanical Design 101, 2014 Impact =Mechanization and automation= mine hoist used for raising ore. This woodblock is from De re metallica by Georg Bauer (Latinized name Georgius Agricola, ca. 1555), an early mining textbook that contains numerous drawings and descriptions of mining equipment. Mechanization or mechanisation (BE) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work. In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being \\"other than hand power\\". Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop. Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience. =Automata= An automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a robot, more specifically an autonomous robot. A Toy Automaton was patented in 1863.  Mechanics  UsherA. P. Usher, 1929, A History of Mechanical Inventions , Harvard University Press (reprinted by Dover Publications 1968). reports that Hero of Alexandria's treatise on Mechanics focussed on the study of lifting heavy weights. Today mechanics refers to the mathematical analysis of the forces and movement of a mechanical system, and consists of the study of the kinematics and dynamics of these systems. =Dynamics of machines= The dynamic analysis of machines begins with a rigid-body model to determine reactions at the bearings, at which point the elasticity effects are included. The rigid-body dynamics studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces. The assumption that the bodies are rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces, simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.B. Paul, Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery, Prentice-Hall, NJ, 1979L. W. Tsai, Robot Analysis: The mechanics of serial and parallel manipulators, John-Wiley, NY, 1999. The dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its equations of motion, which are derived using either Newtons laws of motion or Lagrangian mechanics. The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time. The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of mechanical systems. = Kinematics of machines = The dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement, or kinematics, of its component parts, known as kinematic analysis. The assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational and translational movement to be modeled mathematically as Euclidean, or rigid, transformations. This allows the position, velocity and acceleration of all points in a component to be determined from these properties for a reference point, and the angular position, angular velocity and angular acceleration of the component.  Machine design  Machine design refers to the procedures and techniques used to address the three phases of a machine's lifecycle: # invention, which involves the identification of a need, development of requirements, concept generation, prototype development, manufacturing, and verification testing; # performance engineering involves enhancing manufacturing efficiency, reducing service and maintenance demands, adding features and improving effectiveness, and validation testing; # recycle is the decommissioning and disposal phase and includes recovery and reuse of materials and components.

It lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie in the United States and east of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. and Canada. It encompasses: * The entirety of Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota * Parts of Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming * The southern portions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. The Canadian portion of the Plains is known as the Canadian Prairies. It covers much of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, and a narrow band of southern Manitoba. The Great Plains States Usage The Great Plains near a farming community in central Kansas The term \\"Great Plains\\" is used in the United States to describe a sub-section of the even more vast Interior Plains physiographic division, which covers much of the interior of North America. It also has currency as a region of human geography, referring to the Plains Indians or the Plains states. In Canada the term is rarely used; Natural Resources Canada, the government department responsible for official mapping, treats the Interior Plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains. There is no region referred to as the \\"Great Plains\\" in The Atlas of Canada.Atlas.nrcan.gc.ca In terms of human geography, the term prairie is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the Prairie Provinces or simply \\"the Prairies\\". The North American Environmental Atlas, produced by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a NAFTA agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the \\"Great Plains\\" as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.CEC.org The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub- regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi- Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations. Extent The Great Plains before the native grasses were ploughed under, Haskell County, Kansas, 1897, showing a man sitting behind a buffalo wallow The region is about east to west and north to south. Much of the region was home to American bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid/late-19th century. It has an area of approximately . Current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the Great Plains is shown by this map at the Center for Great Plains Studies, University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. The term \\"Great Plains\\", for the region west of about the 96th and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study Physiographic Subdivision of the United States brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states. Today the term \\"High Plains\\" is used for a subregion of the Great Plains. Geography The Great Plains are the westernmost portion of the vast North American Interior Plains, which extend east to the Appalachian Plateau. The United States Geological Survey divides the Great Plains in the United States into ten physiographic subdivisions: * Coteau du Missouri or Missouri Plateau (which also extends into Canada), glaciated ‚Äì east central South Dakota, northern and eastern North Dakota and northeastern Montana; * Coteau du Missouri, unglaciated ‚Äì western South Dakota, northeastern Wyoming, southwestern North Dakota and southeastern Montana; * Black Hills ‚Äì western South Dakota; * High Plains ‚Äì southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska (including the Sand Hills), eastern Colorado, western Kansas, western Oklahoma, eastern New Mexico, and northwestern Texas (including the Llano Estacado and Texas Panhandle); * Plains Border ‚Äì central Kansas and northern Oklahoma (including the Flint, Red and Smoky Hills); * Colorado Piedmont ‚Äì eastern Colorado; * Raton section ‚Äì northeastern New Mexico; * Pecos Valley ‚Äì eastern New Mexico; * Edwards Plateau ‚Äì south central Texas; and * Central Texas section ‚Äì central Texas. The Great Plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal strata extends westward from the 97th meridian west to the base of the Rocky Mountains, a distance of from . It extends northward from the Mexican boundary far into Canada. Although the altitude of the plains increases gradually from 600 or on the east to 4,000‚Äì5,000 or near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The semi-arid climate excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views. The plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of erosional development. They are occasionally interrupted by buttes and escarpments. They are frequently broken by valleys. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved. The western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains is more climatic than topographic. The line of 20 in. of annual rainfall trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies. The plains may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features. = Northern Great Plains = The northern section of the Great Plains, north of latitude 44¬∞, including eastern Montana, north-eastern Wyoming, most of North and South Dakota, and the Canadian Prairies, is a moderately dissected peneplain. Missouri River Valley in Central North Dakota, near Stanton, ND This is one of the best examples of its kind. The strata here are Cretaceous or early Tertiary, lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional lava-capped mesas and dike formed ridges, surmounting the general level by or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread erosion of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper Missouri River and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the Pleistocene ice sheet. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains near by on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is . The northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The Black Hills, chiefly in western South Dakota, are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about north-south by east-west. At Black Elk Peak, they reach an altitude of and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area. = Intermediate Great Plains = Miocene epoch layers under late Pleistocene and Holocene layers Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, NebraskaIn the intermediate section of the plains, between latitudes 44¬∞ and 42¬∞, including southern South Dakota and northern Nebraska, the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the Badlands, it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes: * the dry climate, which prevents the growth of a grassy turf * the fine texture of the Tertiary strata in the badland districts * every little rill, at times of rain, carves its own little valley. = Central Great Plains = The High Plains of Kansas, in the Smoky Hills near Nicodemus The central section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 42¬∞ and 36¬∞, occupying eastern Colorado and western Kansas, is, briefly stated, for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a piedmont deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. While the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas (Mesa de Maya, Raton Mesa) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded. = Southern Great Plains = View of Lake Lawtonka, wind turbines, and plains from atop Mount Scott in Oklahoma The southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5¬∞ and 25.5¬∞, lies in western Texas, eastern New Mexico, and western Oklahoma. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in such strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the Llano Estacado. It measures roughly east-west and north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about , then about 7 ft per mile (1.3 m/km), to its eastern and southern borders, where it is in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth. It is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the Canadian River, and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the Pecos River. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by limestone that underlies both the Llano Uplift on the west and the Grand Prairies escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the Edwards Plateau, is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the Rio Grande embayment. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma, the westernmost member of the Ouachita system. Paleontology During the Cretaceous Period (145‚Äì66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway. However, during the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene (65‚Äì55 million years ago), the seaway had begun to recede, leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied. During the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals, giving rise to the \\"grit, not grass\\" hypothesis.Phillip E. Jardine, Christine M. Janis, Sarda Sahney, Michael J. Benton. \\"Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires.\\" Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology.

October 2, 2006. Climate Bison at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma Burkburnett, Texas In general, the Great Plains have a wide range of weather, with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers. Wind speeds are often very high, especially in winter. Grasslands are among the least protected biomes. Humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures. The 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receives or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than . In this context, the High Plains, as well as Southern Alberta, south-western Saskatchewan and Eastern Montana are mainly semi arid steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought; high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate. Many thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer. The southeastern portion of the Great Plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as Tornado Alley. Flora The Great Plains are part of the floristic North American Prairies Province, which extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians. History =Original American contact= Buffalo hunt under the wolf-skin mask, George Catlin, 1832‚Äì33. The first Americans (Paleo- Indians) arrived on the Great Plains thousands of years ago. Historically, the Great Plains were the range of the Blackfoot, Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and others. Eastern portions of the Great Plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent villages of earth lodges, such as the Arikara, Mandan, Pawnee, and Wichita. Great Plains in North Dakota 2007, where communities began settling in the 1870s. The first known contact between Europeans and Indians in the Great Plains occurred in what is now Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska from 1540 to 1542 with the arrival of Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado, a Spanish conquistador. In that same period, Hernando de Soto crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now Oklahoma and Texas which is now known as the De Soto Trail. The Spanish thought that the Great Plains were the location of the mythological Quivira and C√≠bola, a place said to be rich in gold. The fur trade brought thousands of colonial settlers into the Great Plains over the next 100 years. Fur trappers made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Indians. The United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and conducted the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804‚Äì1806, and more information became available concerning the Plains, and various pioneers entered the areas. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more settlers migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population, and new settlements became dotted across the Great Plains. The settlers also brought diseases against which the Indians had no resistance. Between a half and two- thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the Louisiana Purchase.\\"Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992)\\".

The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to American farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. Towns flourished if they were favored by proximity to the railroad.Raymond A. Mohl, The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860‚Äì1920 (1985) p. 69 Much of the Great Plains became open range where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals, and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as Dodge City, KansasRobert R. Dykstra, Cattle Towns: A Social History of the Kansas Cattle Trading Centers (1968) and Ogallala, Nebraska; from there, cattle were shipped east.John Rossel, \\"The Chisholm Trail,\\" Kansas Historical Quarterly (1936) Vol. 5, No. 1 pp 3‚Äì14 online edition The U.S. passed the Homestead Acts of 1862 to encourage agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population. It allowed a settler to claim up to of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building houses out of the very turf of the land. Many of them were not skilled farmers, and failures were frequent. The Dominion Lands Act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.Ian Frazier, Great Plains (2001) p. 72 File:Homesteader NE 1866.pngHomesteaders in central Nebraska in 1886 File:\\"Wheat field on Dutch flats near Mitchell, Nebr.

Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation that they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many responsibilities.Deborah Fink, Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880‚Äì1940 (1992). During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology encouraged women to turn to domestic roles, including sewing and washing machines. Media and government extension agents promoted the \\"scientific housekeeping\\" movement, along with county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm book keeping, and home economics courses in the schools.Chad Montrie, \\"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\\", Great Plains Quarterly, Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245‚Äì258. Online The eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, yet plains residents created busy social lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities which combined work, food, and entertainment, such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees,Karl Ronning, \\"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880‚Äì1920\\", Uncoverings, 1992, Vol. 13, pp. 169‚Äì191. Grange meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits among families.Nathan B. Sanderson, \\"More Than a Potluck\\", Nebraska History, Fall 2008, Vol. 89 Issue 3, pp. 120‚Äì131. =20th century= Withdrawal rates from the Ogallala Aquifer The region roughly centered on the Oklahoma Panhandle was known as the Dust Bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s, including southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, and extreme northeastern New Mexico. The effects of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the Great Depression forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains. From the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large land-holdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the Ogallala Aquifer, a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata. Center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.Bobby A. Stewart and Terry A. Howell, Encyclopedia of water science (2003) p. 43 Population decline The rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than , the density standard that Frederick Jackson Turner used to declare the American frontier \\"closed\\" in 1893. Many have fewer than . There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,Amanda Rees, The Great Plains region (2004) p. xvi and there has been a proposal to return approximately of these drier parts to native prairie land. Wind farm in the plains of West Texas Wind power The Great Plains contributes substantially to wind power in the United States. T. Boone Pickens developed wind farms after a career as a petroleum executive, and he called for the U.S. to invest $1 trillion to build an additional 200,000 MW of wind power in the Plains as part of his Pickens Plan. He cited Sweetwater, Texas as an example of economic revitalization driven by wind power development.

His extant works include comedies, farces, tragicomedies, com√©die-ballets and more. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise more often than those of any other playwright today.Hartnoll, p. 554. \\"Author of some of the finest comedies in the history of the theater\\", and Roy, p. 756. \\"...one of the theatre's greatest comic artists\\". His influence is such that the French language is often referred to as the \\"language of Moli√®re\\". Born into a prosperous family and having studied at the Coll√®ge de Clermont (now Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand), Moli√®re was well suited to begin a life in the theatre. Thirteen years as an itinerant actor helped him polish his comic abilities while he began writing, combining Commedia dell'arte elements with the more refined French comedy.Roy, p. 756. Through the patronage of aristocrats including Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans‚Äîthe brother of Louis XIV‚ÄîMoli√®re procured a command performance before the King at the Louvre. Performing a classic play by Pierre Corneille and a farce of his own, The Doctor in Love, Moli√®re was granted the use of salle du Petit-Bourbon near the Louvre, a spacious room appointed for theatrical performances. Later, he was granted the use of the theatre in the Palais-Royal. In both locations, Moli√®re found success among Parisians with plays such as The Affected Ladies, The School for Husbands and The School for Wives. This royal favour brought a royal pension to his troupe and the title Troupe du Roi (\\"The King's Troupe\\"). Moli√®re continued as the official author of court entertainments.Roy, p. 756‚Äì757. Despite the adulation of the court and Parisians, Moli√®re's satires attracted criticism from churchmen. For Tartuffe's impiety, the Catholic Church denounced this study of religious hypocrisy followed by the Parliament's ban, while Don Juan was withdrawn and never restaged by Moli√®re. His hard work in so many theatrical capacities took its toll on his health and, by 1667, he was forced to take a break from the stage. In 1673, during a production of his final play, The Imaginary Invalid, Moli√®re, who suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, was seized by a coughing fit and a haemorrhage while playing the hypochondriac Argan. He finished the performance but collapsed again and died a few hours later. Life Portrait of Moli√®re by Nicolas Mignard Moli√®re was born in Paris shortly before his christening as Jean Poquelin on 15 January 1622. Known as Jean-Baptiste, he was the first son of Jean Poquelin and Marie Cress√©, who had married on 27 April 1621.Gaines 2002, p. 383 (birthdate); Scott 2000, p. 14 (names). His mother was the daughter of a prosperous bourgeois family. Upon seeing him for the first time, a maid exclaimed, \\"Le nez!\\", a reference to the infant's large nose. Moli√®re was called \\"Le Nez\\" by his family from that time. He lost his mother when he was 11, and he does not seem to have been particularly close to his father. After his mother's death, he lived with his father above the Pavillon des Singes on the rue Saint- Honor√©, an affluent area of Paris. It is likely that his education commenced with studies at a Parisian elementary school,Scott 2000, p. 16. followed by his enrolment in the prestigious Jesuit Coll√®ge de Clermont, where he completed his studies in a strict academic environment and got a first taste of life on the stage. In 1631, his father Jean Poquelin purchased from the court of Louis XIII the posts of \\"\\" (\\"valet of the King's chamber and keeper of carpets and upholstery\\"). His son assumed the same posts in 1641.Alfred Simon, Moli√®re, une vie (Lyon: La Manufacture, 1988), pp. 520-21. The title required only three months' work and an initial cost of 1,200 livres; the title paid 300 livres a year and provided a number of lucrative contracts. Moli√®re also studied as a provincial lawyer some time around 1642, probably in Orl√©ans, but it is not documented that he ever qualified. So far he had followed his father's plans, which had served him well; he had mingled with nobility at the Coll√®ge de Clermont and seemed destined for a career in office. In June 1643, when Moli√®re was 21, he decided to abandon his social class and pursue a career on the stage. Taking leave of his father, he joined the actress Madeleine B√©jart, with whom he had crossed paths before, and founded the Illustre Th√©√¢tre with 630 livres. They were later joined by Madeleine's brother and sister. Illustration after Pierre Brissart for the printed text of L'√âtourdi ou les Contretemps The theatre troupe went bankrupt in 1645. Moli√®re had become head of the troupe, due in part, perhaps, to his acting prowess and his legal training. However, the troupe had acquired large debts, mostly for the rent of the theatre (a court for jeu de paume), for which they owed 2000 livres. Historians differ as to whether his father or the lover of a member of his troupe paid his debts; either way, after a 24-hour stint in prison he returned to the acting circuit. It was at this time that he began to use the pseudonym Moli√®re, possibly inspired by a small village of the same name in the Midi near Le Vigan. It was likely that he changed his name to spare his father the shame of having an actor in the family (actors, although no longer vilified by the state under Louis XIV, were still not allowed to be buried in sacred ground). After his imprisonment, he and Madeleine began a theatrical circuit of the provinces with a new theatre troupe; this life was to last about twelve years, during which he initially played in the company of Charles Dufresne, and subsequently created a company of his own, which had sufficient success and obtained the patronage of Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans. Few plays survive from this period. The most noteworthy are L'√âtourdi ou les Contretemps (The Bungler) and Le Docteur Amoureux (The Doctor in Love); with these two plays, Moli√®re moved away from the heavy influence of the Italian improvisational Commedia dell'arte, and displayed his talent for mockery. In the course of his travels he met Armand, Prince of Conti, the governor of Languedoc, who became his patron, and named his company after him. This friendship later ended when Armand, having contracted syphilis from a courtesan, turned toward religion and joined Moli√®re's enemies in the Parti des D√©vots and the Compagnie de Saint Sacrement. In Lyon, Mademoiselle Du Parc, known as Marquise, joined the company. Marquise was courted, in vain, by Pierre Corneille and later became the lover of Jean Racine. Racine offered Moli√®re his tragedy Th√©ag√®ne et Charicl√©e (one of the early works he wrote after he had abandoned his theology studies), but Moli√®re would not perform it, though he encouraged Racine to pursue his artistic career. It is said that soon thereafter Moli√®re became angry with Racine when he was told that he had secretly presented his tragedy to the company of the H√¥tel de Bourgogne as well. =Return to Paris= Moli√®re was forced to reach Paris in stages, staying outside for a few weeks in order to promote himself with society gentlemen and allow his reputation to feed in to Paris. Moli√®re reached Paris in 1658 and performed in front of the King at the Louvre (then for rent as a theatre) in Corneille's tragedy Nicom√®de and in the farce Le Docteur Amoureux with some success. He was awarded the title of Troupe de Monsieur (Monsieur being the honorific for the king's brother Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans). With the help of Monsieur, his company was allowed to share the theatre in the large hall of the Petit- Bourbon with the famous Italian Commedia dell'arte company of Tiberio Fiorillo, famous for his character of Scaramouche. (The two companies performed in the theatre on different nights.) The premiere of Moli√®re's Les Pr√©cieuses Ridicules (The Affected Young Ladies) took place at the Petit- Bourbon on 18 November 1659. Les Pr√©cieuses Ridicules was the first of Moli√®re's many attempts to satirize certain societal mannerisms and affectations then common in France. It is widely accepted that the plot was based on Samuel Chappuzeau's Le Cercle des Femmes of 1656. He primarily mocks the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, a group created by Richelieu under a royal patent to establish the rules of the fledgling French theatre. The Acad√©mie preached unity of time, action, and styles of verse. Moli√®re is often associated with the claim that comedy castigat ridendo mores or \\"criticises customs through humour\\" (a phrase in fact coined by his contemporary Jean de Santeuil and sometimes mistaken for a classical Latin proverb).Martin Barnham. \\"The Cambridge Guide to Theater.\\" Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1995, p. 472. =Height of fame= Despite his own preference for tragedy, which he had tried to further with the Illustre Th√©√¢tre, Moli√®re became famous for his farces, which were generally in one act and performed after the tragedy. Some of these farces were only partly written, and were played in the style of Commedia dell'arte with improvisation over a canovaccio (a vague plot outline). He began to write full, five-act comedies in verse (L'√âtourdi (Lyon, 1654) and Le d√©pit amoureux (B√©ziers, 1656)), which although immersed in the gags of contemporary Italian troupes, were successful as part of Madeleine B√©jart and Moli√®re's plans to win aristocratic patronage and, ultimately, move the troupe to a position in a Paris theater-venue.On L'√âtourdi and his theatrical accomplishments in this and other early plays, see e.g. Stephen C. Bold, ‚Äú‚ÄòCe Noeud Subtil‚Äô: Moliere‚Äôs Invention of Comedy from L‚ÄôEtourdi to ‚Äò'Les Fourberies de Scapin \\", \\" The Romanic Review 88/1(1997): 67-85; David Maskell, Moliere's L'Etourdi: Signs of Things to Come\\", French Studies 46/1 (1992): 13-25; and Philip A. Wadsworth, \\"Scappino & Mascarille,\\" in Moliere and the Comedy of Intellect (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1962), 1-7. Later Moli√®re concentrated on writing musical comedies, in which the drama is interrupted by songs and/or dances, but for years the fundamentals of numerous comedy-traditions would remain strong, especially Italian (e.g. the semi-improvisatory style that in the 1750s writers started calling commedia dell'arte), Spanish, and French plays, all also drawing on classical models (e.g. Plautus and Terence), especially the trope of the clever slave/servant.Richard F. Hardin, Plautus and the English Renaissance of Comedy (London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017), esp. 73 and 134; ; and Philip Wadsworth, Moli√®re and the Italian Theatrical Tradition (Birmingham AL: Summa, 1987), 7; Les pr√©cieuses ridicules won Moli√®re the attention and the criticism of many, but it was not a popular success. He then asked Fiorillo to teach him the techniques of Commedia dell'arte. His 1660 play Sganarelle, ou Le Cocu imaginaire (The Imaginary Cuckold) seems to be a tribute both to Commedia dell'arte and to his teacher. Its theme of marital relationships dramatizes Moli√®re's pessimistic views on the falsity inherent in human relationships. This view is also evident in his later works and was a source of inspiration for many later authors, including (in a different field and with different effect) Luigi Pirandello. It describes a kind of round dance where two couples believe that each of their partners has been betrayed by the other's and is the first in Moli√®re's \\"Jealousy series\\", which includes Dom Garcie de Navarre, L'√âcole des maris and L'√âcole des femmes. First volume of a 1739 translation into English of all of Moli√®re's plays, printed by John Watts. In 1660 the Petit-Bourbon was demolished to make way for the eastern expansion of the Louvre, but Moli√®re's company was allowed to move into the abandoned theatre in the east wing of the Palais-Royal. After a period of refurbishment they opened there on 20 January 1661. In order to please his patron, Monsieur, who was so enthralled with entertainment and art that he was soon excluded from state affairs, Moli√®re wrote and played Dom Garcie de Navarre ou Le Prince jaloux (The Jealous Prince, 4 February 1661), a heroic comedy derived from a work of Cicognini's. Two other comedies of the same year were the successful L'√âcole des maris (The School for Husbands) and Les F√¢cheux, subtitled Com√©die faite pour les divertissements du Roi (a comedy for the King's amusements) because it was performed during a series of parties that Nicolas Fouquet gave in honor of the sovereign. These entertainments led Jean-Baptiste Colbert to demand the arrest of Fouquet for wasting public money, and he was condemned to life imprisonment.Jacob Soll, The Information Master: Jean-Baptiste Colbert's Secret State Intelligence System (Ann Arbor: Univ. of MI Press, 2009), 43-52. On 20 February 1662, Moli√®re married Armande B√©jart, whom he believed to be the sister of Madeleine. (She may have been her illegitimate daughter with the Duke of Modena.) The same year, he premiered L'√âcole des femmes (The School for Wives), subsequently regarded as a masterpiece. It poked fun at the limited education that was given to daughters of rich families and reflected Moli√®re's own marriage. Both this work and his marriage attracted much criticism. The play sparked the protest called the \\"Quarrel of L'√âcole des femmes\\". On the artistic side he responded with two lesser-known works: La Critique de \\"L'√âcole des femmes\\", in which he imagined the spectators of his previous work attending it. The piece mocks the people who had criticised L'√âcole des femmes by showing them at dinner after watching the play; it addresses all the criticism raised about the piece by presenting the critics' arguments and then dismissing them. This was the so-called Guerre comique (War of Comedy), in which the opposite side was taken by writers like Donneau de Vis√©, Edm√© Boursault, and Montfleury. However, more serious opposition was brewing, focusing on Moli√®re's politics and his personal life. A so-called parti des D√©vots arose in French high society, who protested against Moli√®re's excessive \\"realism\\" and irreverence, which were causing some embarrassment. These people accused Moli√®re of having married his daughter. The Prince of Conti, once Moli√®re's friend, joined them. Moli√®re had other enemies, too, among them the Jansenists and some traditional authors. However, the king expressed support for the author, granting him a pension and agreeing to be the godfather of Moli√®re's first son. Boileau also supported him through statements that he included in his Art po√©tique. Moli√®re's friendship with Jean-Baptiste Lully influenced him towards writing his Le Mariage forc√© and La Princesse d'√âlide (subtitled as Com√©die galante m√™l√©e de musique et d'entr√©es de ballet), written for royal \\"divertissements\\" at the Palace of Versailles. Tartuffe, ou L'Imposteur was also performed at Versailles, in 1664, and created the greatest scandal of Moli√®re's artistic career. Its depiction of the hypocrisy of the dominant classes was taken as an outrage and violently contested. It also aroused the wrath of the Jansenists and the play was banned. Moli√®re was always careful not to attack the institution of monarchy. He earned a position as one of the king's favourites and enjoyed his protection from the attacks of the court. The king allegedly suggested that Moli√®re suspend performances of Tartuffe, and the author rapidly wrote Dom Juan ou le Festin de Pierre to replace it. It was a strange work, derived from a work by Tirso de Molina and rendered in a prose that still seems modern today. It describes the story of an atheist who becomes a religious hypocrite and for this is punished by God. This work too was quickly suspended. The king, demonstrating his protection once again, became the new official sponsor of Moli√®re's troupe. With music by Lully, Moli√®re presented L'Amour m√©decin (Love Doctor or Medical Love). Subtitles on this occasion reported that the work was given \\"par ordre du Roi\\" (by order of the king) and this work was received much more warmly than its predecessors. Louis XIV invites Moli√®re to share his supper‚Äîan unfounded Romantic anecdote, illustrated in 1863 painting by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me In 1666, Le Misanthrope was produced. It is now widely regarded as Moli√®re's most refined masterpiece, the one with the highest moral content, but it was little appreciated at its time. It caused the \\"conversion\\" of Donneau de Vis√©, who became fond of his theatre. But it was a commercial flop, forcing Moli√®re to immediately write Le m√©decin malgr√© lui (The Doctor Despite Himself), a satire against the official sciences. This was a success despite a moral treatise by the Prince of Conti, criticizing the theatre in general and Moli√®re in particular. In several of his plays, Moli√®re depicted the physicians of his day as pompous individuals who speak (poor) Latin to impress others with false erudition, and know only clysters and bleedings as (ineffective) remedies. After the M√©licerte and the Pastorale comique, he tried again to perform a revised Tartuffe in 1667, this time with the name of Panulphe or L'Imposteur. As soon as the King left Paris for a tour, Lamoignon and the archbishop banned the play. The King finally imposed respect for Tartuffe a few years later, after he had gained more power over the clergy. Moli√®re, now ill, wrote less. Le Sicilien ou L'Amour peintre was written for festivities at the castle of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and was followed in 1668 by Amphitryon, inspired both by Plautus' work of the same name and Jean Rotrou's successful reconfiguration of the drama. With some conjecture, Moli√®re's play can be seen to allude to the love affairs of Louis XIV, then king of France. George Dandin, ou Le mari confondu (The Confounded Husband) was little appreciated, but success returned with L'Avare (The Miser), now very well known. With Lully he again used music for Monsieur de Pourceaugnac, for Les Amants magnifiques, and finally for Le Bourgeois gentilhomme (The Middle Class Gentleman), another of his masterpieces. It is claimed to be particularly directed against Colbert, the minister who had condemned his old patron Fouquet. The collaboration with Lully ended with a trag√©die et ballet, Psych√©, written in collaboration with Pierre Corneille and Philippe Quinault. In 1672, Madeleine B√©jart died, and Moli√®re suffered from this loss and from the worsening of his own illness. Nevertheless, he wrote a successful Les Fourberies de Scapin (\\"Scapin's Deceits\\"), a farce and a comedy in five acts. His following play, La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas, is considered one of his lesser works. Les Femmes savantes (The Learned Ladies) of 1672 is considered another of Moli√®re's masterpieces. It was born from the termination of the legal use of music in theatre, since Lully had patented the opera in France (and taken most of the best available singers for his own performances), so Moli√®re had to go back to his traditional genre. It was a great success, and it led to his last work (see below), which is still held in high esteem. In his 14 years in Paris, Moli√®re singlehandedly wrote 31 of the 85 plays performed on his stage. =Les Com√©dies-Ballets= In 1661, Moli√®re introduced the com√©dies-ballets in conjunction with Les F√¢cheux. These ballets were a transitional form of dance performance between the court ballets of Louis XIV and the art of professional theatre which was developing in the advent of the use of the proscenium stage. The com√©dies-ballets developed accidentally when Moli√®re was enlisted to mount both a play and a ballet in the honor of Louis XIV and found that he did not have a big enough cast to meet these demands. Moli√®re therefore decided to combine the ballet and the play so that his goal could be met while the performers catch their breath and change costume. The risky move paid off and Moli√®re was asked to produce twelve more com√©dies-ballets before his death. During the com√©dies-ballets, Moli√®re collaborated with Pierre Beauchamp. Beauchamp codified the five balletic positions of the feet and arms and was partly responsible for the creation of the Beauchamp-Feuillet dance notation. Moli√®re also collaborated with Jean-Baptiste Lully. Lully was a dancer, choreographer, and composer, whose dominant reign at the Paris Op√©ra lasted 15 years. Under his command, ballet and opera rightly became professional arts unto themselves. The com√©dies-ballets closely integrated dance with music and the action of the play and the style of continuity distinctly separated these performances from the court ballets of the time; additionally, the com√©dies- ballets demanded that both the dancers and the actors play an important role in advancing the story. Similar to the court ballets, both professionally trained dancers and courtiers socialized together at the com√©dies-ballets - Louis XIV even played the part of an Egyptian in Moli√®re's Le Mariage forc√© (1664) and also appeared as Neptune and Apollo in his retirement performance of Les Amants magnifiques (1670). Death Moli√®re's tomb at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. La Fontaine's is visible just beyond. Moli√®re suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, possibly contracted when he was imprisoned for debt as a young man. The circumstances of Moli√®re's death, on 17 February 1673, became legend. He collapsed on stage in a fit of coughing and haemorrhaging while performing in the last play he had written, which had lavish ballets performed to the music of Marc-Antoine Charpentier and which ironically was titled Le Malade imaginaire (The Imaginary Invalid). Moli√®re insisted on completing his performance. Afterwards he collapsed again with another, larger haemorrhage before being taken home, where he died a few hours later, without receiving the last rites because two priests refused to visit him while a third arrived too late. The superstition that green brings bad luck to actors is said to originate from the colour of the clothing he was wearing at the time of his death. Under French law at the time, actors were not allowed to be buried in the sacred ground of a cemetery. However, Moli√®re's widow, Armande, asked the King if her spouse could be granted a normal funeral at night. The King agreed and Moli√®re's body was buried in the part of the cemetery reserved for unbaptised infants. In 1792, his remains were brought to the museum of French monuments, and in 1817, transferred to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, close to those of La Fontaine. Reception of his works Moli√®re statue on the Fontaine Moli√®re, corner of Rue de Richelieu and Rue Moli√®re in Paris Though conventional thinkers, religious leaders and medical professionals in Moli√®re's time criticised his work, their ideas did not really diminish his widespread success with the public. Other playwrights and companies began to emulate his dramatic style in England and in France. Moli√®re's works continued to garner positive feedback in 18th-century England, but they were not so warmly welcomed in France at this time. However, during the French Restoration of the 19th century, Moli√®re's comedies became popular with both the French public and the critics. Romanticists admired his plays for the unconventional individualism they portrayed. 20th-century scholars have carried on this interest in Moli√®re and his plays and have continued to study a wide array of issues relating to this playwright. Many critics now are shifting their attention from the philosophical, religious and moral implications in his comedies to the more objective study of his comic technique. Moli√®re's works were translated into English prose by John Ozell in 1714, but the first complete version in English, by Baker and Miller in 1739, remained \\"influential\\" and was long reprinted. The first to offer full translations of Moli√®re's verse plays such as Tartuffe into English verse was Curtis Hidden Page, who produced blank verse versions of three of the plays in his 1908 translation. Since then, notable translations have been made by Richard Wilbur, Donald M. Frame, and many others. In his memoir A Terrible Liar, actor Hume Cronyn writes that, in 1962, celebrated actor Laurence Olivier criticized Moli√®re. According to Cronyn, he mentioned to Olivier that he (Cronyn) was about to play the title role in The Miser, and that Olivier then responded \\"Moli√®re? Funny as a baby's open grave.\\" Cronyn comments on the incident: \\"You may imagine how that made me feel. Fortunately, he was dead wrong.\\" Author Martha Bellinger points out that: Influence on French culture Moli√®re is considered the creator of modern French comedy. Many words or phrases used in Moli√®re's plays are still used in current French: *A tartuffe is a hypocrite, especially a hypocrite displaying affected morality or religious piety. *A harpagon, named after the main character of The Miser, is an obsessively greedy and cheap man. *The statue of the Commander (statue du Commandeur) from Don Juan is used as a model of implacable rigidity (raide comme la statue du Commandeur). *In Les Fourberies de Scapin, Act II, scene 7, G√©ronte is asked for ransom money for his son, allegedly held in a galley. He repeats, \\"What the deuce did he want to go into that galley for?\\" (\\"Que diable allait-il faire dans cette gal√®re?\\") The phrase \\"to go into that galley\\" is used to describe unnecessary difficulties a person has sought. Note that a punishment in 16th and 17th century France was condemnation to life as a galley slave. *In Le m√©decin malgr√© lui, forced to impersonate a doctor, the chancer Sganarelle examines a young woman who is faking muteness in order to delay an arranged marriage. He then delivers to her father a \\"diagnosis\\" which consists of strings of jibberish, dog latin and recursive explanations which conclude with an authoritative \\"and so that is why your daughter is mute\\" (\\"Et voil√† pourquoi votre fille est muette\\"). The phrase is used wholesale to mock an unsatisfactory explanation. *Monsieur Jourdain in Le Bourgeois gentilhomme arranges to be tutored in good manners and culture, and is delighted to learn that, because every statement that is not poetry is prose, he therefore has been speaking prose for 40 years without knowing it (\\"Par ma foi, il y a plus de quarante ans que je dis de la prose, sans que j‚Äôen susse rien\\"). The more modern phrase \\"je parle de la prose sans le savoir\\" is used by a person who realizes that he was more skilled or better aligned than he thought. Portrayals of Moli√®re Moli√®re plays a small part in Alexandre Dumas's novel The Vicomte of Bragelonne, in which he is seen taking inspiration from the muskeeter Porthos for his central character in Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov wrote a semi-fictitious biography-tribute to Moli√®re, titled Life of Mr. de Moli√®re. It was written in 1932‚Äì1933 and first published 1962. The French 1978 film simply titled Moli√®re directed by Ariane Mnouchkine and starring Philippe Caub√®re presents his complete biography. It was in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1978. He is portrayed among other writers in The Blasphemers' Banquet (1989). The 2000 film Le Roi Danse (The King Dances), in which Moli√®re is played by Tch√©ky Karyo, shows his collaborations with Jean-Baptiste Lully, as well as his illness and on-stage death. The 2007 French film Moli√®re was more loosely based on the life of Moli√®re, starring Romain Duris, Fabrice Luchini and Ludivine Sagnier. David Hirson's play La B√™te, written in the style of Moli√®re, includes the character Elomire as an anagrammatic parody of him.

In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts. Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species in which the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle. Molds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and Ascomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the Deuteromycota. Mold had been used as a common name for now non-fungal groups such as water molds or slime molds that were previously classified as fungi. Molds cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds. Biology There are thousands of known species of molds, which have diverse life-styles including saprotrophs, mesophiles, psychrophiles and thermophiles and a very few opportunistic pathogens of humans. They all require moisture for growth and some live in aquatic environments. Like all fungi, molds derive energy not through photosynthesis but from the organic matter on which they live, utilising heterotrophy. Typically, molds secrete hydrolytic enzymes, mainly from the hyphal tips. These enzymes degrade complex biopolymers such as starch, cellulose and lignin into simpler substances which can be absorbed by the hyphae. In this way, molds play a major role in causing decomposition of organic material, enabling the recycling of nutrients throughout ecosystems. Many molds also synthesise mycotoxins and siderophores which, together with lytic enzymes, inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. Molds can also grow on stored food for animals and humans, making the food unpalatable or toxic and are thus a major source of food losses and illness. Many strategies for food preservation (salting, pickling, jams, bottling, freezing, drying) are to prevent or slow mold growth as well as growth of other microbes. Molds reproduce by producing large numbers of small spores, which may contain a single nucleus or be multinucleate. Mold spores can be asexual (the products of mitosis) or sexual (the products of meiosis); many species can produce both types. Some molds produce small, hydrophobic spores that are adapted for wind dispersal and may remain airborne for long periods; in some the cell walls are darkly pigmented, providing resistance to damage by ultraviolet radiation. Other mold spores have slimy sheaths and are more suited to water dispersal. Mold spores are often spherical or ovoid single cells, but can be multicellular and variously shaped. Spores may cling to clothing or fur; some are able to survive extremes of temperature and pressure. Although molds can grow on dead organic matter everywhere in nature, their presence is visible to the unaided eye only when they form large colonies. A mold colony does not consist of discrete organisms but is an interconnected network of hyphae called a mycelium. All growth occurs at hyphal tips, with cytoplasm and organelles flowing forwards as the hyphae advance over or through new food sources. Nutrients are absorbed at the hyphal tip. In artificial environments such as buildings, humidity and temperature are often stable enough to foster the growth of mold colonies, commonly seen as a downy or furry coating growing on food or other surfaces. Few molds can begin growing at temperatures of or below, so food is typically refrigerated at this temperature. When conditions do not enable growth to take place, molds may remain alive in a dormant state depending on the species, within a large range of temperatures. The many different mold species vary enormously in their tolerance to temperature and humidity extremes. Certain molds can survive harsh conditions such as the snow-covered soils of Antarctica, refrigeration, highly acidic solvents, anti- bacterial soap and even petroleum products such as jet fuel. Xerophilic molds are able to grow in relatively dry, salty, or sugary environments, where water activity (aw) is less than 0.85; other molds need more moisture. Common molds Spores from green mold growing on an orange, 1000√ó wet mount Common genera of molds include: * Acremonium * Alternaria * Aspergillus * Cladosporium * Fusarium * Mucor * Penicillium * Rhizopus * Stachybotrys * Trichoderma * Trichophyton Food production The molds are a group of Aspergillus species, notably Aspergillus oryzae, and secondarily A. sojae, that have been cultured in eastern Asia for many centuries. They are used to ferment a soybean and wheat mixture to make soybean paste and soy sauce. Koji molds break down the starch in rice, barley, sweet potatoes, etc., a process called saccharification, in the production of sake, sh≈çch≈´ and other distilled spirits. Koji molds are also used in the preparation of Katsuobushi. Red rice yeast is a product of the mold Monascus purpureus grown on rice, and is common in Asian diets. The yeast contains several compounds collectively known as monacolins, which are known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. A study has shown that red rice yeast used as a dietary supplement, combined with fish oil and healthy lifestyle changes, may help reduce \\"bad\\" cholesterol as effectively as certain commercial statin drugs. Nonetheless, other work has shown it may not be reliable (perhaps due to non-standardization) and even toxic to liver and kidneys.Red Yeast Rice Preparations: Are They Suitable Substitutions for Statins?, Dujovne, CA,Am J Med. 2017 Oct;130(10):1148-1150. doi: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.05.013. Epub 2017 Jun 7. Some sausages, such as salami, incorporate starter cultures of molds to improve flavour and reduce bacterial spoilage during curing. Penicillium nalgiovense, for example, may appear as a powdery white coating on some varieties of dry-cured sausage. Other molds that have been used in food production include: * Fusarium venenatum ‚Äì quorn * Geotrichum candidum ‚Äì cheese * Neurospora sitophila ‚Äì oncom * Penicillium spp. ‚Äì various cheeses including Brie and Blue cheese * Rhizomucor miehei ‚Äì microbial rennet for making vegetarian and other cheeses * Rhizopus oligosporus ‚Äì tempeh * Rhizopus oryzae ‚Äì tempeh, jiuqu for jiuniang or precursor for making Chinese rice wine Pharmaceuticals from molds Alexander Fleming's accidental discovery of the antibiotic penicillin involved a Penicillium mold called Penicillium rubrum (although the species was later established to be Penicillium rubens). Fleming continued to investigate Penicillin, showing that it could inhibit various types of bacteria found in infections and other ailments, but he was unable to produce the compound in large enough amounts necessary for production of a medicine. His work was expanded by a team at Oxford University; Clutterbuck, Lovell, and Raistrick, who began to work on the problem in 1931. This team was also unable to produce the pure compound in any large amount, and found that the purification process diminished its effectiveness and negated the anti-bacterial properties it had. Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, Norman Heatley, Edward Abraham, also all at Oxford, continued the work. They enhanced and developed the concentration technique by using organic solutions rather than water, and created the \\"Oxford Unit\\" to measure penicillin concentration within a solution. They managed to purify the solution, increasing its concentration by 45‚Äì50 times, but found that a higher concentration was possible. Experiments were conducted and the results published in 1941, though the quantities of Penicillin produced were not always high enough for the treatments required. As this was during the Second World War, Florey sought USA Government involvement. With research teams in the UK and some in the US, industrial-scale production of crystallized penicillin was developed during 1941‚Äì1944 by the USDA and by Pfizer. Several statin cholesterol-lowering drugs (such as lovastatin, from Aspergillus terreus) are derived from molds. The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine, used to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs, is derived from the mold Tolypocladium inflatum. Health effects Molds are ubiquitous, and mold spores are a common component of household and workplace dust; however, when mold spores are present in large quantities, they can present a health hazard to humans, potentially causing allergic reactions and respiratory problems. Some molds also produce mycotoxins that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. Some studies claim that exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases, death. Prolonged exposure, e.g. daily home exposure, may be particularly harmful. Research on the health impacts of mold has not been conclusive. The term \\"toxic mold\\" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as Stachybotrys chartarum, and not to all molds in general.Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008. Mold in the home can usually be found in damp, dark or steamy areas, e.g. bathrooms, kitchens, cluttered storage areas, recently flooded areas, basement areas, plumbing spaces, areas with poor ventilation and outdoors in humid environments. Symptoms caused by mold allergy are: watery, itchy eyes; a chronic cough; headaches or migraines; difficulty breathing; rashes; tiredness; sinus problems; nasal blockage and frequent sneezing. Molds can also pose a hazard to human and animal health when they are consumed following the growth of certain mold species in stored food. Some species produce toxic secondary metabolites, collectively termed mycotoxins including aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, citrinin, and patulin. These toxic properties may be used for the benefit of humans when the toxicity is directed against other organisms; for example, penicillin adversely affects the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Clostridium species), certain spirochetes and certain fungi.Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, Blood and Studdert, 1999 Growth in buildings and homes Moldy housecorner from outside and inside Mold growth in buildings generally occurs as fungi colonize porous building materials, such as wood. Many building products commonly incorporate paper, wood products, or solid wood members, such as paper-covered drywall, wood cabinets, and insulation. Interior mold colonization can lead to a variety of health problems as microscopic airborne reproductive spores, analogous to tree pollen, are inhaled by building occupants. High quantities of indoor airborne spores as compared to exterior conditions are strongly suggestive of indoor mold growth.IICRC S500 Standard and Reference Guide for Professional Water Damage Restoration Determination of airborne spore counts is accomplished by way of an air sample, in which a specialized pump with a known flow rate is operated for a known period of time. To account for background levels, air samples should be drawn from the affected area, a control area, and the exterior. The air sampler pump draws in air and deposits microscopic airborne particles on a culture medium. The medium is cultured in a laboratory and the fungal genus and species are determined by visual microscopic observation. Laboratory results also quantify fungal growth by way of a spore count for comparison among samples. The pump operation time is recorded and when multiplied by pump flow rate results in a specific volume of air obtained. Although a small volume of air is actually analyzed, common laboratory reports extrapolate the spore count data to estimate spores that would be present in a cubic meter of air. Various practices can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels that can facilitate mold growth. Properly functioning air conditioning (AC) units are essential to controlling levels of indoor airborne fungal spores. Air filtration reduces the number of spores available for germination, especially when a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is used. A properly functioning AC unit also reduces the relative humidity in rooms. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently recommends that relative humidity be maintained below 60%, ideally between 30% to 50%, to inhibit mold growth. Click on \\"Moisture and Mold Prevention and Control Tips\\". Considering that fungal growth requires cellulose, plant fiber, as a food source, using building materials that do not contain cellulose is an effective method of preventing fungal growth. Eliminating the moisture source is the first step at fungal remediation. Removal of affected materials may also be necessary for remediation, if materials are easily replaceable and not part of the load-bearing structure. Professional drying of concealed wall cavities and enclosed spaces such as cabinet toekick spaces may be required. Post- remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful remediation. Many contractors perform post-remediation verification themselves, but property owners may benefit from independent verification. Use in art Del Nero artwork using mold Various artists have used mold in various artistic fashions. Daniele Del Nero, for example, constructs scale models of houses and office buildings and then induces mold to grow on them, giving them an unsettling, reclaimed-by-nature look. Stacy Levy sandblasts enlarged images of mold onto glass, then allows mold to grow in the crevasses she has made, creating a macro-micro portrait. Sam Taylor-Johnson has made a number of time-lapse films capturing the gradual decay of classically arranged still lifes.

This image covers a one- millimeter square. Another microscopic view of a mycelium. Numbered ticks are 230 ¬µm apart. Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) growing fast on coffee grounds Mycelium as seen under a log Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus or fungus-like bacterial colony, consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. The mass of hyphae is sometimes called shiro, especially within the fairy ring fungi. Fungal colonies composed of mycelium are found in and on soil and many other substrates. A typical single spore germinates into a monokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible monokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms. A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that is too small to see, or may grow to span thousands of acres as in Armillaria. Through the mycelium, a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment. It does this in a two-stage process. First, the hyphae secrete enzymes onto or into the food source, which break down biological polymers into smaller units such as monomers. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Mycelia are vital in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for their role in the decomposition of plant material. They contribute to the organic fraction of soil, and their growth releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere (see carbon cycle). Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium, as well as the mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase the efficiency of water and nutrient absorption of most plants and confers resistance to some plant pathogens. Mycelium is an important food source for many soil invertebrates. \\"Mycelium\\", like \\"fungus\\", can be considered a mass noun, a word that can be either singular or plural. The term \\"mycelia\\", though, like \\"fungi\\", is often used as the preferred plural form. Sclerotia are compact or hard masses of mycelium. Uses One of the primary roles of fungi in an ecosystem is to decompose organic compounds. Petroleum products and some pesticides (typical soil contaminants) are organic molecules (i.e., they are built on a carbon structure), and thereby show a potential carbon source for fungi. Hence, fungi have the potential to eradicate such pollutants from their environment unless the chemicals prove toxic to the fungus. This biological degradation is a process known as bioremediation. Mycelial mats have been suggested (see Paul Stamets) as having potential as biological filters, removing chemicals and microorganisms from soil and water. The use of fungal mycelium to accomplish this has been termed mycofiltration. Knowledge of the relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plants suggests new ways to improve crop yields. When spread on logging roads, mycelium can act as a binder, holding new soil in place and preventing washouts until woody plants can be established. Since 2007, a company called Ecovative Design has been developing alternatives to polystyrene and plastic packaging by growing mycelium in agricultural waste. The two ingredients are mixed together and placed into a mold for 3‚Äì5 days to grow into a durable material. Depending on the strain of mycelium used, they make many different varieties of the material including water absorbent, flame retardant, and dielectric. In 2013, another company (MycoWorks) started producing mycelium furniture, mycelium bricks and mycelium leather. Bolt Threads is another company that uses mycelium to create a fake \\"leather\\", dubbed \\"Mylo\\", which has been incorporated into designs by Stella McCartney. Fungi are essential for converting biomass into compost, as they decompose feedstock components such as lignin, which many other composting microorganisms cannot. Turning a backyard compost pile will commonly expose visible networks of mycelia that have formed on the decaying organic material within. Compost is an essential soil amendment and fertilizer for organic farming and gardening. Composting can divert a substantial fraction of municipal solid waste from landfills.

In biology, a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. Myxozoan spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.\\"Myxozoa \\". Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 January 2014. Spores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division, producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as alternation of generations. The spores of seed plants are produced internally, and the megaspores (formed within the ovules) and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the seeds and pollen grains. Definition The term spore derives from the ancient Greek word œÉœÄŒøœÅŒ¨ spora, meaning \\"seed, sowing\\", related to œÉœÄœåœÅŒøœÇ sporos, \\"sowing\\", and œÉœÄŒµŒØœÅŒµŒπŒΩ speirein, \\"to sow\\". In common parlance, the difference between a \\"spore\\" and a \\"gamete\\" is that a spore will germinate and develop into a sporeling, while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further. The main difference between spores and seeds as dispersal units is that spores are unicellular, the first cell of a gametophyte, while seeds contain within them a developing embryo (the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation), produced by the fusion of the male gamete of the pollen tube with the female gamete formed by the megagametophyte within the ovule. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes. Classification of spore-producing organisms =Plants= Vascular plant spores are always haploid. Vascular plants are either homosporous (or isosporous) or heterosporous. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. Heterosporous plants, such as seed plants, spikemosses, quillworts, and ferns of the order Salviniales produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a \\"female\\" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a \\"male\\". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a megasporangium that produces megaspores or a microsporangium that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively. =Fungi= Fungi commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are usually haploid and grow into mature haploid individuals through mitotic division of cells (Urediniospores and Teliospores among rusts are dikaryotic). Dikaryotic cells result from the fusion of two haploid gamete cells. Among sporogenic dikaryotic cells, karyogamy (the fusion of the two haploid nuclei) occurs to produce a diploid cell. Diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores. Classification of spores Spores can be classified in several ways: =By spore-producing structure= Asci of Morchella elata, containing ascospores In plants, microspores, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis. In contrast, in many seed plants and heterosporous ferns, only a single product of meiosis will become a megaspore (macrospore), with the rest degenerating. Fungi In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi. * Sporangiospores: spores produced by a sporangium in many fungi such as zygomycetes. * Zygospores: spores produced by a zygosporangium, characteristic of zygomycetes. * Ascospores: spores produced by an ascus, characteristic of ascomycetes. * Basidiospores: spores produced by a basidium, characteristic of basidiomycetes. * Aeciospores: spores produced by an aecium in some fungi such as rusts or smuts. * Urediniospores: spores produced by a uredinium in some fungi such as rusts or smuts. * Teliospores: spores produced by a telium in some fungi such as rusts or smuts. * Oospores: spores produced by an oogonium, characteristic of oomycetes. Red algae * Carpospores: spores produced by a carposporophyte, characteristic of red algae. * Tetraspores: spores produced by a tetrasporophyte, characteristic of red algae. =By function= * Chlamydospores: thick-walled resting spores of fungi produced to survive unfavorable conditions. * Parasitic fungal spores may be classified into internal spores, which germinate within the host, and external spores, also called environmental spores, released by the host to infest other hosts.. modares.ac.ir =By origin during life cycle= * Meiospores: spores produced by meiosis; they are thus haploid, and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of gametophytes of seed plants found in flowers (angiosperms) or cones (gymnosperms), and the zoospores produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as Ulva.  Microspores: meiospores that give rise to a male gametophyte, (pollen in seed plants).  Megaspores (or macrospores): meiospores that give rise to a female gametophyte, (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the ovule). * Mitospores (or conidia, conidiospores): spores produced by mitosis; they are characteristic of Ascomycetes. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called \\"mitosporic fungi\\" or \\"anamorphic fungi\\", and are previously classified under the taxon Deuteromycota (See Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph). =By mobility= Spores can be differentiated by whether they can move or not. * Zoospores: mobile spores that move by means of one or more flagella, and can be found in some algae and fungi. * Aplanospores: immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella. * Autospores: immobile spores that cannot develop flagella. * Ballistospores: spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most basidiospores are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus Pilobolus. * Statismospores: spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are puffballs. External anatomy Late Silurian origin Tricolpate pollen of Ricinus Under high magnification, spores often have complex patterns or ornamentation on their exterior surfaces. A specialized terminology has been developed to describe features of such patterns. Some markings represent apertures, places where the tough outer coat of the spore can be penetrated when germination occurs. Spores can be categorized based on the position and number of these markings and apertures. Alete spores show no lines. In monolete spores, there is a single narrow line (laesura) on the spore. This indicates the mother spore split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, each spore shows three narrow lines radiating from a center pole. This shows that four spores shared a common origin and were initially in contact with each other forming a tetrahedron. A wider aperture in the shape of a groove may be termed a colpus. The number of colpi distinguishes major groups of plants. Eudicots have tricolpate spores (i.e. spores with three colpi). =Spore tetrads and trilete spores= Envelope-enclosed spore tetrads are taken as the earliest evidence of plant life on land, dating from the mid-Ordovician (early Llanvirn, ~), a period from which no macrofossils have yet been recovered. Individual trilete spores resembling those of modern cryptogamic plants first appeared in the fossil record at the end of the Ordovician period. Dispersal Spores being ejected by fungi. In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as hydrophobins, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of osmolytes in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 g. Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by puffballs. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the stinkhorns. In Common Smoothcap moss (Atrichum undulatum), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.Johansson, L√∂nnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a. In the case of spore-shedding vascular plants such as ferns, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce. In the spikemoss Selaginella lepidophylla, dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of diaspore, a tumbleweed.

After receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna in 1931 he worked in Munich. By 1933, however, Singer left Germany for Vienna due to the political deterioration in Germany. There he met his wife, Martha Singer. From Vienna, Singer and his wife went to Barcelona, Spain, where Singer was appointed Assistant Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Persecution by the Spanish authorities on behalf of the German government forced Singer to leave Spain for France in 1934. After a fellowship at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, Singer again moved, this time to Leningrad, where he was Senior Scientific Expert at the Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. During his time at the Academy, Singer made many expeditions to Siberia, the Altai Mountains, and Karelia. In 1941, Singer emigrated to the United States. He was offered a position at Harvard University's Farlow Herbarium as a research associate, then as Assistant Curator, then as acting Curator following the death of Dr. David Linder. He spent a total of seven years at the Farlow. During this time, Singer also received a Guggenheim Fellowship for studies in Florida, and taught at the Mountain Lake Biological Station of the University of Virginia. In 1948, Singer left Harvard to become professor at the Universidad Nacional de Tucuman in Argentina. Later, in 1961, Singer became professor at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. During his time in South America, Singer, his wife, and his daughter Heidi collected extensively. Singer's last faculty appointment was at the University of Illinois at Chicago, from 1968 to 1977. Singer was a prolific writer, with more than 400 publications to his name. He was also known for his eagerness to aid other mycologists, whether they were professionals or amateurs. He wrote major books like \\"The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy\\". He fled to various countries during the Nazi period, pursuing mycology in far-flung places like the Soviet Union, Argentina, and finally the United States, as mycologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.

Aspergillus niger Conidia on conidiophores A hypha (plural hyphae, from Greek ·ΩëœÜŒÆ, huph·∏ó, \\"web\\") is a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium. In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium. Structure A hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. In most fungi, hyphae are divided into cells by internal cross-walls called \\"septa\\" (singular septum). Septa are usually perforated by pores large enough for ribosomes, mitochondria and sometimes nuclei to flow between cells. The major structural polymer in fungal cell walls is typically chitin, in contrast to plants and oomycetes that have cellulosic cell walls. Some fungi have aseptate hyphae, meaning their hyphae are not partitioned by septa. Hyphae have an average diameter of 4‚Äì6 ¬µm. Growth Hyphae grow at their tips. During tip growth, cell walls are extended by the external assembly and polymerization of cell wall components, and the internal production of new cell membrane. The spitzenk√∂rper is an intracellular organelle associated with tip growth. It is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components. The spitzenk√∂rper is part of the endomembrane system of fungi, holding and releasing vesicles it receives from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles travel to the cell membrane via the cytoskeleton and release their contents (including various cysteine-rich proteins including cerato-platanins and hydrophobins) outside the cell by the process of exocytosis, where it can then be transported to where it is needed. Vesicle membranes contribute to growth of the cell membrane while their contents form new cell wall. The spitzenk√∂rper moves along the apex of the hyphal strand and generates apical growth and branching; the apical growth rate of the hyphal strand parallels and is regulated by the movement of the spitzenk√∂rper. As a hypha extends, septa may be formed behind the growing tip to partition each hypha into individual cells. Hyphae can branch through the bifurcation of a growing tip, or by the emergence of a new tip from an established hypha.  Behavior  The direction of hyphal growth can be controlled by environmental stimuli, such as the application of an electric field. Hyphae can sense reproductive units from some distance, and grow towards them. Hyphae can weave through a permeable surface to penetrate it. Modifications Hyphae may be modified in many different ways to serve specific functions. Some parasitic fungi form haustoria that function in absorption within the host cells. The arbuscules of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi serve a similar function in nutrient exchange, so are important in assisting nutrient and water absorption by plants. Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium greatly increases the soil area available for exploitation by plant hosts by funneling water and nutrients to ectomycorrhizas, complex fungal organs on the tips of plant roots. Hyphae are found enveloping the gonidia in lichens, making up a large part of their structure. In nematode-trapping fungi, hyphae may be modified into trapping structures such as constricting rings and adhesive nets. Mycelial cords can be formed to transfer nutrients over larger distances. Bulk fungal tissues, cords, and membranes, such as those of mushrooms and lichens, are mainly composed of felted and often anastomosed hyphae.Moore, David. Robson, Geoffrey D. Trinci, Anthony P. J. 21st Century Guidebook to Fungi. Publisher: Cambridge University Press 2011  Types  = Classification based on cell division = *Septate (with septa) Aspergillus and many other species have septate hyphae. *Aseptate or coenocytic (without septa) Non-septate hyphae are associated with Mucor, some zygomycetes, and other fungi. *\\"Pseudohyphae\\" are distinguished from true hyphae by their method of growth, relative frailty and lack of cytoplasmic connection between the cells.  Yeast can form pseudohyphae. They are the result of a sort of incomplete budding where the cells elongate but remain attached after division. Some yeasts can also form true septate hyphae. = Classification based on cell wall and overall form = Characteristics of hyphae can be important in fungal classification. In basidiomycete taxonomy, hyphae that comprise the fruiting body can be identified as generative, skeletal, or binding hyphae. *Generative hyphae are relatively undifferentiated and can develop reproductive structures. They are typically thin-walled, occasionally developing slightly thickened walls, usually have frequent septa, and may or may not have clamp connections. They may be embedded in mucilage or gelatinized materials. *Skeletal hyphae are of two basic types. The classical form is thick-walled and very long in comparison to the frequently septate generative hyphae, which are unbranched or rarely branched, with little cell content. They have few septa and lack clamp connections. Fusiform skeletal hyphae are the second form of skeletal hyphae. Unlike typical skeletal hyphae these are swollen centrally and often exceedingly broad, hence giving the hypha a fusiform shape. *Binding hyphae are thick-walled and frequent branched. Often they resemble deer antlers or defoliated trees because of the many tapering branches. Based on the generative, skeletal and binding hyphal types, in 1932 E. J. H. Corner applied the terms monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic to hyphal systems, in order to improve the classification of polypores. *Every fungus must contain generative hyphae. A fungus which only contains this type, as do fleshy mushrooms such as agarics, is referred to as monomitic. *Skeletal and binding hyphae give leathery and woody fungi such as polypores their tough consistency. If a fungus contains all three types (example: Trametes), it is called trimitic. *If a fungus contains generative hyphae and just one of the other two types, it is called dimitic. In fact dimitic fungi almost always contain generative and skeletal hyphae; there is one exceptional genus, Laetiporus that includes only generative and binding hyphae. Fungi that form fusiform skeletal hyphae bound by generative hyphae are said to have sarcodimitic hyphal systems. A few fungi form fusiform skeletal hyphae, generative hyphae, and binding hyphae, and these are said to have sarcotrimitic hyphal systems. These terms were introduced as a later refinement by E. J. H. Corner in 1966. = Classification based on refractive appearance = Hyphae are described as \\"gloeoplerous\\" (\\"gloeohyphae\\") if their high refractive index gives them an oily or granular appearance under the microscope. These cells may be yellowish or clear (hyaline). They can sometimes selectively be coloured by sulphovanillin or other reagents. The specialized cells termed cystidia can also be gloeoplerous.See glossary of Meinhard Moser, translated by Simon Plant: Keys to Agarics and Boleti (Roger Phillips 1983) .See section \\"Microscopic features ...\\" of 2006 Summer Workshop in Fungal Biology for High School Teachers , Hibbett lab, Biology Department, Clark University, \\"Guidelines for collecting and identifying macrofungi (basidiomycetes)\\". = Classification based on growth location = Hyphae might be categorized as 'vegetative' or 'aerial.'

Mutualism is a common type of ecological interaction. Prominent examples include most vascular plants engaged in mutualistic interactions with mycorrhizae, flowering plants being pollinated by animals, vascular plants being dispersed by animals, and corals with zooxanthellae, among many others. Mutualism can be contrasted with interspecific competition, in which each species experiences reduced fitness, and exploitation, or parasitism, in which one species benefits at the \\"expense\\" of the other. Mutualism is often conflated with two other types of ecological phenomena: cooperation and symbiosis. Cooperation refers to increases in fitness through within-species (intraspecific) interactions. Symbiosis involves two species living in proximity and may be mutualistic, parasitic, or commensal, so symbiotic relationships are not always mutualistic. Mutualism plays a key part in ecology. For example, mutualistic interactions are vital for terrestrial ecosystem function as more than 48% of land plants rely on mycorrhizal relationships with fungi to provide them with inorganic compounds and trace elements. As another example, the estimate of tropical forest trees with seed dispersal mutualisms with animals ranges from 70‚Äì90%. In addition, mutualism is thought to have driven the evolution of much of the biological diversity we see, such as flower forms (important for pollination mutualisms) and co-evolution between groups of species.Thompson, J. N. 2005 The geographic mosaic of coevolution. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. However, mutualism has historically received less attention than other interactions such as predation and parasitism. The term mutualism was introduced by Pierre-Joseph van Beneden in his 1876 book Animal Parasites and Messmates. Types = Resource-resource relationships = Mutualistic relationships can be thought of as a form of \\"biological barter\\" in mycorrhizal associations between plant roots and fungi, with the plant providing carbohydrates to the fungus in return for primarily phosphate but also nitrogenous compounds. Other examples include rhizobia bacteria that fix nitrogen for leguminous plants (family Fabaceae) in return for energy- containing carbohydrates. =Service-resource relationships= The red-billed oxpecker eats ticks on the impala's coat, in a cleaning symbiosis. Service- resource relationships are common. Three important types are pollination, cleaning symbiosis, and zoochory. In pollination, a plant trades food resources in the form of nectar or pollen for the service of pollen dispersal. Phagophiles feed (resource) on ectoparasites, thereby providing anti-pest service, as in cleaning symbiosis. Elacatinus and Gobiosoma, genera of gobies, feed on ectoparasites of their clients while cleaning them. Zoochory is the dispersal of the seeds of plants by animals. This is similar to pollination in that the plant produces food resources (for example, fleshy fruit, overabundance of seeds) for animals that disperse the seeds (service). Another type is ant protection of aphids, where the aphids trade sugar-rich honeydew (a by-product of their mode of feeding on plant sap) in return for defense against predators such as ladybugs. =Service-service relationships= Ocellaris clownfish and Ritter's sea anemones live in a mutual service-service symbiosis, the fish driving off butterflyfish and the anemone's tentacles protecting the fish from predators. Strict service-service interactions are very rare, for reasons that are far from clear. One example is the relationship between sea anemones and anemone fish in the family Pomacentridae: the anemones provide the fish with protection from predators (which cannot tolerate the stings of the anemone's tentacles) and the fish defend the anemones against butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae), which eat anemones. However, in common with many mutualisms, there is more than one aspect to it: in the anemonefish-anemone mutualism, waste ammonia from the fish feeds the symbiotic algae that are found in the anemone's tentacles. Therefore, what appears to be a service-service mutualism in fact has a service-resource component. A second example is that of the relationship between some ants in the genus Pseudomyrmex and trees in the genus Acacia, such as the whistling thorn and bullhorn acacia. The ants nest inside the plant's thorns. In exchange for shelter, the ants protect acacias from attack by herbivores (which they frequently eat, introducing a resource component to this service-service relationship) and competition from other plants by trimming back vegetation that would shade the acacia. In addition, another service-resource component is present, as the ants regularly feed on lipid- rich food-bodies called Beltian bodies that are on the Acacia plant. In the neotropics, the ant Myrmelachista schumanni makes its nest in special cavities in Duroia hirsute. Plants in the vicinity that belong to other species are killed with formic acid. This selective gardening can be so aggressive that small areas of the rainforest are dominated by Duroia hirsute. These peculiar patches are known by local people as \\"devil's gardens\\".Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. In some of these relationships, the cost of the ant's protection can be quite expensive. Cordia sp. trees in the Amazonian rainforest have a kind of partnership with Allomerus sp. ants, which make their nests in modified leaves. To increase the amount of living space available, the ants will destroy the tree's flower buds. The flowers die and leaves develop instead, providing the ants with more dwellings. Another type of Allomerus sp. ant lives with the Hirtella sp. tree in the same forests, but in this relationship the tree has turned the tables on the ants. When the tree is ready to produce flowers, the ant abodes on certain branches begin to wither and shrink, forcing the occupants to flee, leaving the tree's flowers to develop free from ant attack. The term \\"species group\\" can be used to describe the manner in which individual organisms group together. In this non- taxonomic context one can refer to \\"same-species groups\\" and \\"mixed-species groups.\\" While same-species groups are the norm, examples of mixed-species groups abound. For example, zebra (Equus burchelli) and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) can remain in association during periods of long distance migration across the Serengeti as a strategy for thwarting predators. Cercopithecus mitis and Cercopithecus ascanius, species of monkey in the Kakamega Forest of Kenya, can stay in close proximity and travel along exactly the same routes through the forest for periods of up to 12 hours. These mixed- species groups cannot be explained by the coincidence of sharing the same habitat. Rather, they are created by the active behavioural choice of at least one of the species in question. Mathematical modeling Mathematical treatments of mutualisms, like the study of mutualisms in general, has lagged behind those of predation, or predator-prey, consumer-resource, interactions. In models of mutualisms, the terms \\"type I\\" and \\"type II\\" functional responses refer to the linear and saturating relationships, respectively, between benefit provided to an individual of species 1 (y-axis) on the density of species 2 (x-axis). =Type I functional response= One of the simplest frameworks for modeling species interactions is the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations.May, R., 1981. Models for Two Interacting Populations. In: May, R.M., Theoretical Ecology. Principles and Applications, 2nd ed. pp. 78‚Äì104. In this model, the change in population density of the two mutualists is quantified as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dN_1}{dt} &=r_1 N_1 - \\\\alpha_{11} N_1^2 + \\\\beta _{12}N_1N_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\frac{dN_2}{dt} &=r_2 N_2 - \\\\alpha_{22} N_2^2 + \\\\beta _{21}N_1N_2 \\\\end{align} where * N_i = the population densities. * r_i = the intrinsic growth rate of the population. * \\\\alpha _{ii} = the negative effect of within-species crowding. * \\\\beta _{ij} = the beneficial effect of a mutualistic partner's density. Mutualism is in essence the logistic growth equation + mutualistic interaction. The mutualistic interaction term represents the increase in population growth of species one as a result of the presence of greater numbers of species two, and vice versa. As the mutualistic term is always positive, it may lead to unrealistic unbounded growth as it happens with the simple model. So, it is important to include a saturation mechanism to avoid the problem. =Type II functional response= In 1989, David Hamilton Wright modified the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations by adding a new term, Œ≤M/K, to represent a mutualistic relationship. Wright also considered the concept of saturation, which means that with higher densities, there are decreasing benefits of further increases of the mutualist population. Without saturation, species' densities would increase indefinitely. Because that isn't possible due to environmental constraints and carrying capacity, a model that includes saturation would be more accurate. Wright's mathematical theory is based on the premise of a simple two-species mutualism model in which the benefits of mutualism become saturated due to limits posed by handling time. Wright defines handling time as the time needed to process a food item, from the initial interaction to the start of a search for new food items and assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive. Mutualists that display foraging behavior are exposed to the restrictions on handling time. Mutualism can be associated with symbiosis. Handling time interactions In 1959, C. S. Holling performed his classic disc experiment that assumed the following: that (1), the number of food items captured is proportional to the allotted searching time; and (2), that there is a variable of handling time that exists separately from the notion of search time. He then developed an equation for the Type II functional response, which showed that the feeding rate is equivalent to : \\\\cfrac{ax}{1+axT_H} where, * a=the instantaneous discovery rate * x=food item density * TH=handling time The equation that incorporates Type II functional response and mutualism is: : \\\\frac{dN}{dt}=N\\\\left[r(1-cN)+\\\\cfrac{baM}{1+aT_H M}\\\\right] where * N and M=densities of the two mutualists * r=intrinsic rate of increase of N * c=coefficient measuring negative intraspecific interaction. This is equivalent to inverse of the carrying capacity, 1/K, of N, in the logistic equation. * a=instantaneous discovery rate * b=coefficient converting encounters with M to new units of N or, equivalently, : \\\\frac{dN}{dt}=N[r(1-cN)+\\\\beta M/(X+M)] where * X=1/a TH * Œ≤=b/TH This model is most effectively applied to free- living species that encounter a number of individuals of the mutualist part in the course of their existences. Wright notes that models of biological mutualism tend to be similar qualitatively, in that the featured isoclines generally have a positive decreasing slope, and by and large similar isocline diagrams. Mutualistic interactions are best visualized as positively sloped isoclines, which can be explained by the fact that the saturation of benefits accorded to mutualism or restrictions posed by outside factors contribute to a decreasing slope. The type II functional response is visualized as the graph of \\\\cfrac{baM}{1+aT_H M} vs. M.  Structure of networks  Mutualistic networks made up out of the interaction between plants and pollinators were found to have a similar structure in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species. The structure of these mutualistic networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions and on the community carrying capacity. Mathematical models that examine the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators, reduce the spread of indirect effects and thus enhance ecosystem stabilitySuweis, S., Grilli, J., Banavar, J. R., Allesina, S., & Maritan, A. (2015) Effect of localization on the stability of mutualistic ecological networks. \\"Nature Communications\\", 6 and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions. Such a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed. Humans Dogs and sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated. Humans are involved in mutualisms with other species: their gut flora is essential for efficient digestion. Infestations of head lice might have been beneficial for humans by fostering an immune response that helps to reduce the threat of body louse borne lethal diseases. Some relationships between humans and domesticated animals and plants are to different degrees mutualistic. For example, agricultural varieties of maize provide food for humans and are unable to reproduce without human intervention because the leafy sheath does not fall open, and the seedhead (the \\"corn on the cob\\") does not shatter to scatter the seeds naturally. In traditional agriculture, some plants have mutualist as companion plants, providing each other with shelter, soil fertility and/or natural pest control. For example, beans may grow up cornstalks as a trellis, while fixing nitrogen in the soil for the corn, a phenomenon that is used in Three Sisters farming. One researcher has proposed that the key advantage Homo sapiens had over Neanderthals in competing over similar habitats was the former's mutualism with dogs. Evolution of Mutualism =Mutualism breakdown= Mutualisms are not static, and can be lost by evolution. Sachs and Simms (2006) suggest that this can occur via 4 main pathways: # One mutualist shifts to parasitism, and no longer benefits its partner, such as headlice # One partner abandons the mutualism and lives autonomously # One partner may go extinct # A partner may be switched to another species.Werner, G. D. A. et al. (2018) 'Symbiont switching and alternative resource acquisition strategies drive mutualism breakdown', bioRxiv, p. 242834 There are many examples of mutualism breakdown. For example, plant lineages inhabiting nutrient-rich environments have evolutionarily abandoned mycorrhizal mutualisms many times independently.Wang, B. and Qiu, Y.-L. (2006) 'Phylogenetic distribution and evolution of mycorrhizas in land plants.', Mycorrhiza, 16(5), pp. 299‚Äì363. Measuring and defining mutualism Measuring the exact fitness benefit to the individuals in a mutualistic relationship is not always straightforward, particularly when the individuals can receive benefits from a variety of species, for example most plant-pollinator mutualisms. It is therefore common to categorise mutualisms according to the closeness of the association, using terms such as obligate and facultative. Defining \\"closeness\\", however, is also problematic. It can refer to mutual dependency (the species cannot live without one another) or the biological intimacy of the relationship in relation to physical closeness (e.g., one species living within the tissues of the other species).Ollerton, J. 2006. \\"Biological Barter\\": Interactions of Specialization Compared across Different Mutualisms. pp. 411‚Äì435 in: Waser, N.M. & Ollerton, J.

It was the precursor of the Nazi Party, which was officially known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (, NSDAP). The DAP only lasted from 5 January 1919 until 24 February 1920.  History  = Origins = On 5 January 1919, the German Workers' Party (DAP) was founded in Munich in the hotel F√ºrstenfelder Hof by Anton Drexler, along with Dietrich Eckart, Gottfried Feder and Karl Harrer. It developed out of the Freier Arbeiterausschuss f√ºr einen guten Frieden (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league, a branch of which Drexler had founded in 1918. Thereafter in 1918, Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society), convinced Drexler and several others to form the Politischer Arbeiterzirkel (Political Workers' Circle). The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and antisemitism. Drexler was encouraged to form the DAP in December 1918 by his mentor, Dr. Paul Tafel. Tafel was a leader of the Alldeutscher Verband (Pan-Germanist Union), a director of the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg and a member of the Thule Society. Drexler's wish was for a political party which was both in touch with the masses and nationalist. With the DAP founding in January 1919, Drexler was elected chairman and Harrer was made Reich Chairman, an honorary title. On 17 May, only ten members were present at the meeting, and a later meeting in August only noted 38 members attending. = Adolf Hitler's membership = Adolf Hitler's DAP card with the membership number 7 (altered from the original) After World War I ended, Adolf Hitler returned to Munich. Having no formal education or career prospects, he tried to remain in the army for as long as possible. In July 1919, he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufkl√§rungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr to influence other soldiers and to investigate the DAP. While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler became attracted to founder Anton Drexler's anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. While attending a party meeting at the Sterneckerbr√§u beer hall on 12 September 1919, Hitler became involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder's arguments in support of Bavaria separatism and against capitalism. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, Baumann left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat. Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party. Although Hitler initially wanted to form his own party, he claimed to have been convinced to join the DAP because it was small and he could eventually become its leader. In less than a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a committee meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the committee meeting held at the run-down Altes Rosenbad beer-house. Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. In this case, Hitler had Captain Karl Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks a week. At the time when Hitler joined the party, there were no membership numbers or cards. It was in January 1920 when a numeration was issued for the first time and listed in alphabetical order Hitler received the number 555. In reality, he had been the 55th member, but the counting started at the number 501 in order to make the party appear larger. In his work Mein Kampf, Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member, and he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee.Werner Maser, Der Sturm auf die Republik ‚Äì Fr√ºhgeschichte der NSDAP, ECON Verlag, D√ºsseldorf, Vienna, New York, Moscow, Special Edition 1994, . After giving his first speech for the DAP on 16 October at the Hofbr√§ukeller, Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator. Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership as crowds began to flock to hear his speeches during 1919‚Äì1920. With the support of Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler preferred that role as he saw himself as the drummer for a national cause. He saw propaganda as the way to bring nationalism to the public. = From DAP to NSDAP = The small number of party members were quickly won over to Hitler's political beliefs. He organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people for 24 February 1920 in the Staatliches Hofbr√§uhaus in M√ºnchen. Further in an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) on 24 February. Such was the significance of Hitler's particular move in publicity that Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement. The new name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time (the Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei, i.e. the German National Socialist Workers' Party), although Hitler earlier suggested the party to be renamed the Social Revolutionary Party. It was Rudolf Jung who persuaded Hitler to adopt the NSDAP name.Konrad Heiden, \\"Les d√©buts du national-socialisme\\", Revue d'Allemagne, VII, No. 71 (Sept. 15, 1933), p. 821.

It is a commune and the capital of the Vienne department and the historical centre of Poitou. Poitiers is a significant university centre. The centre of town is picturesque and its streets include predominantly historical architecture, especially religious architecture and especially from the Romanesque period. Two major battles took place near the city. The first, in 732, also known as the Battle of Tours (to avoid confusion with the second), saw the Franks commanded by Charles Martel defeat an expeditionary army of the Umayyad Caliphate. The second, in 1356, was one of the key battles of the Hundred Years War. It saw the defeat of a large French royal army by the English and the capture of King John II by the victorious Prince of Wales. Geography =Location= The city of Poitiers is strategically situated on the Seuil du Poitou, a shallow gap between the Armorican and the Central Massif. The Seuil du Poitou connects the Aquitaine Basin to the South to the Paris Basin to the North. This area is an important geographic crossroads in France and Western Europe. =Situation= Poitiers's primary site sits on a vast promontory between the valleys of the Boivre and the Clain. The old town occupies the slopes and the summit of a plateau which rises above the streams which surround benefits from a very strong tactical situation. This was an especially important factor before and throughout the Middle Ages. Inhabitants and demography Inhabitants of Poitiers are referred to as Poitevins or Poitevines, although this denomination can be used for anyone from the Poitou province. One out of three people in Poitiers is under the age of 30 and one out of four residents in Poitiers is a student. Climate The climate in the Poitiers area is mild with mild temperature amplitudes, and adequate rainfall throughout the year although with a drying tendency during summer. The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this type of climate is \\"Cfb\\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).Climate Summary for Poitiers, France History =Antiquity= Poitiers was founded by the Celtic tribe of the Pictones and was known as the oppidum Lemonum before Roman influence. The name is said to have come from the Celtic word for elm, Lemo. After Roman influence took over, the town became known as Pictavium, or later \\"Pictavis\\", after the original Pictones inhabitants themselves. There is a rich history of archeological finds from the Roman era in Poitiers. In fact until 1857 Poitiers hosted the ruins of a vast Roman amphitheatre, which was larger than that of N√Æmes. Remains of Roman baths, built in the 1st century and demolished in the 3rd century, were uncovered in 1877. In 1879 a burial-place and tombs of a number of Christian martyrs were discovered on the heights to the south-east of the town. The names of some of the Christians had been preserved in paintings and inscriptions. Not far from these tombs is a huge dolmen (the Pierre Lev√©e), which is long, broad and high, and around which used to be held the great fair of Saint Luke. The Romans also built at least three aqueducts. This extensive ensemble of Roman constructions suggests Poitiers was a town of first importance, possibly even the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Aquitania during the 2nd century. As Christianity was made official and gradually introduced across the Roman Empire during the 3rd and 4th centuries, the first bishop of Poitiers from 350 to 367, Hilary of Poitiers or Saint Hilarius, proceeded to evangelize the town. Exiled by Constantius II, he risked death to return to Poitiers as Bishop. The first foundations of the Baptist√®re Saint-Jean can be traced to that era of open Christian evangelization. He was named \\"Doctor of The Church\\" by Pope Pius IX. In the 4th century, a thick wall 6m wide and 10m high was built around the town. It was long and stood lower on the naturally defended east side and at the top of the promontory. Around this time, the town began to be known as Poitiers. Fifty years later Poitiers fell into the hands of the Arian Visigoths, and became one of the principal residences of their kings. Visigoth King Alaric II was defeated by Clovis I at Vouill√©, not far from Poitiers, in 507, and the town thus came under Frankish dominion. =Middle Ages= Charles-de-Gaulle place and its medieval heritage During most of the Early Middle Ages, the town of Poitiers took advantage of its defensive tactical site and of its location, which was far from the centre of Frankish power. As the seat of an √©v√™ch√© (bishopric) since the 4th century, the town was a centre of some importance and the capital of the Poitou county. At the height of their power, the Counts of Poitiers governed a large domain, including both Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Poitou. The town was often referred to as Poictiers, a name commemorated in warships of the Royal Navy, after the battle of Poi(c)tiers. The first decisive victory of a Western European Christian army over a Muslim power, the Battle of Tours, was fought by Charles Martel's men in the vicinity of Poitiers on 10 October 732. For many historians, it was one of the world's pivotal moments.Professor of religion Huston Smith says in The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions: \\"But for their defeat by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours in 733 , the entire Western world might today be Muslim.\\" Eleanor of Aquitaine frequently resided in the town, which she embellished and fortified, and in 1199 entrusted with communal rights. In 1152 she married the future King Henry II of England in Poitiers Cathedral. During the Hundred Years' War, the Battle of Poitiers, an English victory, was fought near the town of Poitiers on 19 September 1356. Later in the war in 1418, under duress, the royal parliament moved from Paris to Poitiers, where it remained in exile until the Plantagenets finally withdrew from the capital in 1436. During this interval, in 1429 Poitiers was the site of Joan of Arc's formal inquest. The University of Poitiers was founded in 1431. During and after the Reformation, John Calvin had numerous converts in Poitiers and the town had its share of the violent proceedings which underlined the Wars of Religion throughout France. In 1569 Poitiers was defended by Gui de Daillon, comte du Lude, against Gaspard de Coligny, who after an unsuccessful bombardment and seven weeks, retired from a siege he had laid to the town. =16th century= Poitiers in the 16th century The type of political organisation existing in Poitiers during the late medieval or early modern period can be glimpsed through a speech given on 14 July 1595 by Maurice Roatin, the town's mayor. He compared it to the Roman state, which combined three types of government: monarchy (rule by one person), aristocracy (rule by a few), and democracy (rule by the many). He said the Roman consulate corresponded to Poitiers' mayor, the Roman senate to the town's peers and √©chevins, and the democratic element in Rome corresponded to the fact that most important matters \\"can not be decided except by the advice of the Mois et Cent\\" (broad council).1 The mayor appears to have been an advocate of a mixed constitution; not all Frenchmen in 1595 would have agreed with him, at least in public; many spoke in favour of absolute monarchy. The democratic element was not as strong as the mayor's words may seem to imply: in fact, Poitiers was similar to other French cities, Paris, Nantes, Marseille, Limoges, La Rochelle, Dijon, in that the town's governing body (corps de ville) was \\"highly exclusive and oligarchical\\": a small number of professional and family groups controlled most of the city offices. In Poitiers many of these positions were granted for the lifetime of the office holder.2 The city government in Poitiers based its claims to legitimacy on the theory of government where the mayor and √©chevins held jurisdiction of the city's affairs in fief from the king: that is, they swore allegiance and promised support for him, and in return he granted them local authority. This gave them the advantage of being able to claim that any townsperson who challenged their authority was being disloyal to the king. Every year the mayor and the 24 √©chevins would swear an oath of allegiance \\"between the hands\\" of the king or his representative, usually the lieutenant g√©n√©ral or the s√©n√©chauss√©e. For example, in 1567, when Maixent Poitevin was mayor, king Henry III came for a visit, and, although some townspeople grumbled about the licentious behaviour of his entourage, Henry smoothed things over with a warm speech acknowledging their allegiance and thanking them for it.2 In this era, the mayor of Poitiers was preceded by sergeants wherever he went, consulted deliberative bodies, carried out their decisions, \\"heard civil and criminal suits in first instance\\", tried to ensure that the food supply would be adequate, visited markets.2 In the 16th century, Poitiers impressed visitors because of its large size, and important features, including \\"royal courts, university, prolific printing shops, wealthy religious institutions, cathedral, numerous parishes, markets, impressive domestic architecture, extensive fortifications, and castle.\\"3 16th-century Poitiers is closely associated with the life of Fran√ßois Rabelais and with the community of Bitards. =17th century= The town saw less activity during the Renaissance. Few changes were made in the urban landscape, except for laying way for the rue de la Tranch√©e. Bridges were built where the inhabitants had used gu√©s. A few h√¥tels particuliers were built at that time, such as the h√¥tels Jean Bauc√©, Fum√© and Berthelot. Poets Joachim du Bellay and Pierre Ronsard met at the University of Poitiers, before leaving for Paris. During the 17th century, many people emigrated from Poitiers and the Poitou to the French settlements in the new world and thus many Acadians or Cajuns living in North America today can trace ancestry back to this region. =18th century= During the 18th century, the town's activity mainly depended on its administrative functions as a regional centre: Poitiers served as the seat for the regional administration of royal justice, the √©v√™ch√©, the monasteries and the intendance of the G√©n√©ralit√© du Poitou. The Vicomte de Blossac, intendant of Poitou from 1750 to 1784, had a French garden landscaped in Poitiers. He also had Ali√©nor d'Aquitaine's ancient wall razed and modern boulevards were built in its place. =19th century= During the 19th century, many army bases were built in Poitiers because of its central and strategic location. Poitiers became a garrison town, despite its distance from France's borders. The Poitiers train station was built in the 1850s, and connected Poitiers to the rest of France. =20th century and contemporary Poitiers= Poitiers was bombed during World War II, particularly the area around the railway station which was heavily hit on 13 June 1944. From the late 1950s until the late 1960s when Charles de Gaulle ended the American military presence, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force had an array of military installations in France, including a major Army logistics and communications hub in Poitiers, part of what was called the Communication Zone (ComZ), and consisting of a logistics headquarters and communications agency located at Aboville Caserne, a military compound situated on a hill above the city. Hundreds of graduates (\\"Military Brats\\") of Poitiers American High School, a school operated by the Department of Defense School System (DODDS), have gone on to successful careers, including the recent commander-in-chief of U.S. Special Forces Command, Army General Bryan (Doug) Brown. The Caserne also housed a full support community, with a theater, commissary, recreation facilities and an affiliate radio station of the American Forces Network, Europe, headquartered in Frankfurt (now Mannheim, Germany). The town benefited from industrial d√©centralisation in the 1970s, for instance with the installation during that decade of the Michelin and Compagnie des compteurs Schlumberger factories. The Futuroscope theme-park and research park project, built in 1986‚Äì1987 in nearby Chasseneuil-du-Poitou, after an idea by Ren√© Monory, consolidated Poitiers' place as a touristic destination and as a modern university centre, and opened the town to the era of information technology.

These include a volleyball team that play in the French Pro A volleyball league, a basketball team, an amateur football team and a professional rugby team (as of the 2008‚Äì2009 season.) The PB86 or Poitiers Basket 86 (www.pb86.fr) play in the French Pro A basketball league. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, three Americans played for PB86: Rasheed Wright, Kenny Younger and Tommy Gunn. The team played the French championship playoffs in the 2009‚Äì10 season and was the Pro B French Champion for the 2008‚Äì2009 season. The team's communication strategy is considered by some to be one of the best in the French basketball league. Brian Joubert, the figure skating champion, practices at an ice rink in Poitiers and lives with his family in the city. Tourism Historic churches, in particular Romanesque church buildings, are the main attraction inside Poitiers itself. The town's centre is picturesque, with generally well-preserved architecture and a recently re-zoned pedestrian area. There are numerous shops, cafes and restaurants in the town centre. Since 1987, Poitiers' tourist industry has indirectly benefited from the Futuroscope theme-park and research park in nearby Chasseneuil-du-Poitou. The centre of town receives visits in complement to the theme-park and benefits from a larger proportion of European tourists, notably from the United Kingdom. In conjunction, Poitiers' tourism has directly benefited from the TGV high-speed rail link to Paris. Transport Poitiers' railway station lies on the TGV Atlantique line between Paris and Bordeaux. The station is in the valley to the west of the old town centre. Services run to Angoul√™me, Limoges and La Rochelle in addition to Paris and Bordeaux. The direct TGV puts Poitiers 1h40 from Paris' Gare Montparnasse. Poitiers - Biard Airport is located west of Poitiers with flights to Lyon-Saint Exup√©ry, London-Stansted, Edinburgh and Shannon, Ireland on Ryanair. Urban transportation in Poitiers is provided by a company called Vitalis. Regional ground transportation in the department of the Vienne is provided by private bus companies such as \\"Ligne en Vienne\\". Rail transportation in the region is provided by the public TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine (regional express train). From January 2009 to December 2012, Poitiers' town centre went through deep changes to make it less accessible to motor vehicles. The project, named \\"Projet Coeur d'Agglo\\", focused on re-thinking the way people use individual cars to access the town centre and as an everyday way of transportation. On 29 September 2010, 12 streets were permanently closed off to motor vehicles and transformed into an entirely pedestrian zone. Eventually, a new line of fast buses will be added around 2017. Education The city of Poitiers has a very old tradition as a university centre, starting in the Middle Ages. The University of Poitiers was established in 1431 and has welcomed many famous philosophers and scientists throughout the ages (notably Fran√ßois Rabelais; Ren√© Descartes; Francis Bacon; Samir Amin). Today Poitiers has more students per inhabitant than any other large town or city in France. All around, there are over 27,000 university students in Poitiers, nearly 4,000 of which are foreigners, hailing from 117 countries. The University covers all major fields from sciences to geography, history, languages economics and law. The law degree at the University of Poitiers is considered to be one of the best in France. The program was ranked second by l'√âtudiant magazine in 2005. In addition to the University, Poitiers also hosts two engineering schools and two business schools: * the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de m√©canique et d'a√©rotechnique (ENSMA) * the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'ing√©nieurs de Poitiers (ENSIP) * the France Business School (FBS) * the Institut d'Administration des Entreprises de Poitiers (IAE). Since 2001, the city of Poitiers has hosted the first cycle of \\"the South America, Spain and Portugal\\" program from the Paris Institute of Political Studies, also known as Sciences Po.

Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, for they are regarded as established pillars of society and culture,UN UDHR Preamble: \\"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world...\\" and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\". Definitional issues Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest civil disobedience is, itself, a right, and it was advocated by thinkers such as Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term rights. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial. One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as: There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as philosophy, law, deontology, logic, political science, and religion. =Natural versus legal= According to some views, certain rights derive from deities or nature * Natural rights are rights which are \\"natural\\" in the sense of \\"not artificial, not man-made\\", as in rights deriving from human nature or from the edicts of a god. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural right to life. These are sometimes called moral rights or inalienable rights. * Legal rights, in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, statutes or actions by legislatures. An example of a legal right is the right to vote of citizens. Citizenship, itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the \\"right to have rights\\". Legal rights are sometimes called civil rights or statutory rights and are culturally and politically relative since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning. Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, Jeremy Bentham believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas Thomas Aquinas held that rights purported by positive law but not grounded in natural law were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights. =Claim versus liberty= * A claim right is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the claim holder, such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a claim to that service or product (another term is thing in action).Fagan, Andrew. \\"Human Rights\\". Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \\"Person A has a claim that person B do something if and only if B has a duty to A to do that something.\\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \\"life, liberty, and property\\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others not to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services. * A liberty right or privilege, in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are no obligations on other parties to do or not do anything. This can be expressed in logic as: \\"Person A has a privilege to do something if and only if A has no duty not to do that something.\\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does not mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though other rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them. Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a liberty right to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's liberty right of walking extends precisely to the point where another's claim right limits his or her freedom. =Positive versus negative= In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called positive rights. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called negative rights; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the United States, citizens have the positive right to vote and they have the negative right to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. Australia, however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since voting is compulsory. Accordingly: * Positive rights are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \\"right to welfare.\\" * Negative rights are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by libertarians who think of a negative right as an entitlement to non- interference such as a right against being assaulted. Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with active rights (which encompass \\"privileges\\" and \\"powers\\") and passive rights (which encompass \\"claims\\" and \\"immunities\\"). =Individual versus group= The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author Ayn Rand who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as Objectivism. However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or group rights.For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws, 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017). Accordingly: * Individual rights are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof. Do groups have rights? Some argue that when soldiers bond in combat, the group becomes like an organism in itself and has rights which trump the rights of any individual soldier. * Group rights have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having rights. For example, a platoon of soldiers in combat can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \\"right\\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience. But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a labor union can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \\"group\\" as well as by the term \\"group rights.\\" There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called closed shop which has a union security agreement, only the union has a right to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \\"individual rights\\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \\"group rights\\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension. The Austrian School of Economics holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called methodological individualism and is used by the economists to justify individual rights. =Other senses= Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or family resemblance than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, between which the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into three generations. These distinctions have much overlap with that between negative and positive rights, as well as between individual rights and group rights, but these groupings are not entirely coextensive. Politics In the United States, persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \\"Miranda rights\\". The Miranda warning requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney. Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights. Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights. Issues of concern have historically included labor rights, LGBT rights, reproductive rights, disability rights, patient rights and prisoners' rights. With increasing monitoring and the information society, information rights, such as the right to privacy are becoming more important. Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include animals, and amongst humans, groups such as children and youth, parents (both mothers and fathers), and men and women. Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as \\"rights\\" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \\"right to medical care\\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \\"right to a fair trial\\". Further, the term equality which is often bound up with the meaning of \\"rights\\" often depends on one's political orientation. Conservatives and libertarians and advocates of free markets often identify equality with equality of opportunity, and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, socialists often identify equality with equality of outcome and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as health care or economic assistance or housing. Philosophy In philosophy, meta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being normative ethics and applied ethics. While normative ethics addresses such questions as \\"What should one do?\\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta- ethics addresses questions such as \\"What is goodness?\\" and \\"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations. Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of what normative ethics is concerned with (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics). Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following: * Duties (deontology) * Value (axiology) * Virtue (virtue ethics) * Consequences (consequentialism, e.g. utilitarianism) Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights. =Criticism= Some philosophers have criticised rights as ontologically dubious entities. For instance, although in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights, calling them \\"nonsense upon stilts\\". Also see Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all. History Magna Carta or \\"The Great Charter\\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a king to his people to respect certain legal rights. It reduced the power of the monarch. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 in France. The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights. Historically, many notions of rights were authoritarian and hierarchical, with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves. In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized liberty and equality as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the American and French revolutions. Important documents in the political history of rights include: * The Persian Empire of ancient Iran established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under Cyrus the Great. After his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, the king issued the Cyrus cylinder, discovered in 1879 and seen by some today as the first human rights document. * The Constitution of Medina (622 AD; Arabia) instituted a number of rights for the Muslim, Jewish, camp followers and \\"believers\\" of Medina.R. B. Serjeant, The Sunnah Jami'ah, pacts with the Yathrib Jews, and the Tahrim of Yathrib: Analysis and translation of the documents comprised in the so-called \\"Constitution of Medina\\". Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 41, No. 1. (1978), p. 4. * Magna Carta (1215; England) required the King of England to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures, and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by law, after King John promised his barons he would follow the \\"law of the land\\". While Magna Carta was originally a set of rules that the king had to follow, and mainly protected the property of aristocratic landowners, today it is seen as the basis of certain rights for ordinary people, such as the right of due process. * The Declaration of Arbroath (1320; Scotland) established the right of the people to choose a head of state (see popular sovereignty). * The Henrician Articles (1573; Poland-Lithuania) or King Henry's Articles were a permanent contract that stated the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the rights of the nobility to elect the king, to meet in parliament whose approval was required to levy taxes and declare war or peace, to religious liberty and the right to rebel in case the king transgressed against the laws of the republic or the rights of the nobility. * The Bill of Rights (1689; England) declared that Englishmen, as embodied by Parliament, possess certain civil and political rights; the Claim of Right (1689; Scotland) was similar but distinct. * The Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776) by George Mason declared the inherent natural rights and separation of powers. * The United States Declaration of Independence (1776) succinctly defined the rights of man as including, but not limited to, \\"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" which later influenced \\"libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©\\" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France.

The battle was the longest of the First World War and took place on the hills north of Verdun-sur-Meuse. The German 5th Army attacked the defences of the Fortified Region of Verdun (RFV, ) and those of the French Second Army on the right (east) bank of the Meuse. Using the experience of the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, the Germans planned to capture the Meuse Heights, an excellent defensive position with good observation for artillery-fire on Verdun. The Germans hoped that the French would commit their strategic reserve to recapture the position and suffer catastrophic losses at little cost to the Germans. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the attack until 21 February but the Germans captured Fort Douaumont in the first three days. The advance then slowed for several days, despite inflicting many French casualties. By 6 March, French divisions were in the RFV and a more extensive defence in depth had been constructed. Philippe P√©tain ordered no retreat and that German attacks were to be counter- attacked, despite this exposing French infantry to German artillery-fire. By 29 March, French guns on the west bank had begun a constant bombardment of Germans on the east bank, causing many infantry casualties. The German offensive was extended to the left (west) bank of the Meuse, to gain observation and eliminate the French artillery firing over the river but the attacks failed to reach their objectives. In early May, the Germans changed tactics again and made local attacks and counter-attacks; the French recaptured part of Fort Douaumont but then the Germans ejected them and took many prisoners. The Germans tried alternating their attacks on either side of the Meuse and in June captured Fort Vaux. The Germans advanced towards the last geographical objectives of the original plan, at Fleury-devant-Douaumont and Fort Souville, driving a salient into the French defences. Fleury was captured and the Germans came within of the Verdun citadel but in July the offensive was cut back to provide troops, artillery and ammunition for the Battle of the Somme, leading to a similar transfer of the French Tenth Army to the Somme front. From 23 June to 17 August, Fleury changed hands sixteen times and a German attack on Fort Souville failed. The offensive was reduced further but to keep French troops in the RFV, away from the Somme, ruses were used to disguise the change. In September and December, French counter-offensives recaptured much ground on the east bank and recovered Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux. The battle lasted for the longest and one of the most costly in human history. In 2000, Hannes Heer and Klaus Naumann calculated that the French suffered and the Germans a total of an average of a month. In 2014, William Philpott wrote of casualties in 1916 and the vicinity during the war. In France, the battle came to symbolise the determination of the French Army and the destructiveness of the war. Background =Strategic developments= After the German invasion of France had been halted at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, the war of movement ended at the Battle of the Yser and the First Battle of Ypres. The Germans built field fortifications to hold the ground captured in 1914 and the French began siege warfare to break through the German defences and recover the lost territory. In late 1914 and in 1915, offensives on the Western Front had failed to gain much ground and been extremely costly in casualties. According to his memoirs written after the war, the Chief of the German General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn, believed that although victory might no longer be achieved by a decisive battle, the French army could still be defeated if it suffered a sufficient number of casualties. Falkenhayn offered five corps from the strategic reserve for an offensive at Verdun at the beginning of February 1916 but only for an attack on the east bank of the Meuse. Falkenhayn considered it unlikely the French would be complacent about Verdun; he thought that they might send all their reserves there and begin a counter-offensive elsewhere or fight to hold Verdun while the British launched a relief offensive. After the war, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Gerhard Tappen, the Operations Officer at Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, General Headquarters), wrote that Falkenhayn believed the last possibility was most likely. By seizing or threatening to capture Verdun, the Germans anticipated that the French would send all their reserves, which would then have to attack secure German defensive positions supported by a powerful artillery reserve. In the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive (), the German and Austro- Hungarian Armies attacked Russian defences frontally, after pulverising them with large amounts of heavy artillery. During the Second Battle of Champagne ( autumn battle) of , the French suffered \\"extraordinary casualties\\" from the German heavy artillery, which Falkenhayn considered offered a way out of the dilemma of material inferiority and the growing strength of the Allies. In the north, a British relief offensive would wear down British reserves, to no decisive effect but create the conditions for a German counter-offensive near Arras. Hints about Falkenhayn's thinking were picked up by Dutch military intelligence and passed on to the British in December. The German strategy was to create a favourable operational situation without a mass attack, which had been costly and ineffective when it had been tried by the Franco-British, by relying on the power of heavy artillery to inflict mass losses. A limited offensive at Verdun would lead to the destruction of the French strategic reserve in fruitless counter-attacks and the defeat of British reserves in a futile relief offensive, leading to the French accepting a separate peace. If the French refused to negotiate, the second phase of the strategy would begin in which the German armies would attack terminally weakened Franco-British armies, mop up the remains of the French armies and expel the British from Europe. To fulfil this strategy, Falkenhayn needed to hold back enough of the strategic reserve for the Anglo-French relief offensives and then conduct a counter-offensive, which limited the number of divisions which could be sent to the 5th Army at Verdun, for (Operation Judgement). The Fortified Region of Verdun (RFV) lay in a salient formed during the German invasion of 1914. The Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, General Joseph Joffre, had concluded from the swift capture of the Belgian fortresses at the Battle of Li√®ge and at the Siege of Namur in 1914 that fixed defences had been made obsolete by German siege guns. In a directive of the General Staff of 5 August 1915, the RFV was to be stripped of batteries and of ammunition. Plans to demolish forts Douaumont and Vaux to deny them to the Germans were made and of explosives had been laid by the time of the German offensive on 21 February. The forts and other batteries around Verdun were left with fewer than and a small reserve of ammunition while their garrisons had been reduced to small maintenance crews. The railway line from the south into Verdun had been cut during the Battle of Flirey in 1914, with the loss of Saint-Mihiel; the line west from Verdun to Paris was cut at Aubr√©ville in mid-July 1915 by the German 3rd Army, which had attacked southwards through the Argonne Forest for most of the year.  For centuries, Verdun, on the Meuse river, had played an important role in the defence of the French hinterland. Attila the Hun failed to seize the town in the fifth century and when the empire of Charlemagne was divided under the Treaty of Verdun (843), the town became part of the Holy Roman Empire; the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 awarded Verdun to France. At the heart of the city was a citadel built by Vauban in the 17th century. A double ring of and smaller works () had been built around Verdun on commanding ground, at least above the river valley, from the citadel. A programme had been devised by S√©r√© de Rivi√®res in the 1870s to build two lines of fortresses from Belfort to √âpinal and from Verdun to Toul as defensive screens and to enclose towns intended to be the bases for counter-attacks. Many of the Verdun forts had been modernised and made more resistant to artillery, with a reconstruction programme begun at Douaumont in the 1880s. A sand cushion and thick, steel- reinforced concrete tops up to thick, buried under of earth, were added. The forts and were sited to overlook each other for mutual support and the outer ring had a circumference of . The outer forts had in shellproof turrets and more than and machine-guns to protect the ditches around the forts. Six forts had in retractable turrets and fourteen had retractable twin . In 1903, Douaumont was equipped with a new concrete bunker (), containing two 75 mm field guns to cover the south-western approach and the defensive works along the ridge to . More guns were added from in four retractable steel turrets. The guns could rotate for all-round defence and two smaller versions, at the north-eastern and north-western corners of the fort, housed twin Hotchkiss machine-guns. On the east side of the fort, an armoured turret with a gun faced north and north-east and another housed twin at the north end, to cover the intervals between forts. The fort at Douaumont formed part of a complex of the village, fort, six , five shelters, six concrete batteries, an underground infantry shelter, two ammunition depots and several concrete infantry trenches. The Verdun forts had a network of concrete infantry shelters, armoured observation posts, batteries, concrete trenches, command posts and underground shelters between the forts. The artillery comprised , with reserve and the forts and were linked by telephone and telegraph, a narrow-gauge railway system and a road network; on mobilisation, the RFV had a garrison of and rations for six months. Prelude =German offensive preparations= Verdun had been isolated on three sides since 1914 and the mainline Paris‚ÄìSt Menehould‚ÄìLes Islettes‚ÄìClermont-en-Argonne‚ÄìAubr√©ville‚ÄìVerdun railway in the Forest of Argonne was closed in mid-July 1915. The right flank divisions of the 5th Army (Generalmajor Crown Prince Wilhelm) reached the ‚ÄìHill 285 ridge after continuous local attacks, rendering the railway unusable. Only a light railway remained to carry bulk supplies; German-controlled railways lay only to the north of the front line. A corps was moved to the 5th Army to provide labour for the preparation of the offensive. Areas were emptied of French civilians and buildings requisitioned. Thousands of kilometres of telephone cable were laid, a huge amount of ammunition and rations was dumped under cover and hundreds of guns were emplaced and camouflaged. Ten new rail lines with twenty stations were built and vast underground shelters () deep were dug, each to accommodate up to infantry. The III Corps, VII Reserve Corps and XVIII Corps were transferred to the 5th Army, each corps being reinforced by troops and recruits. V Corps was placed behind the front line, ready to advance if necessary when the assault divisions were moving up. XV Corps, with two divisions, was in the 5th Army reserve, ready to advance to mop up as soon as the French defence collapsed. Special arrangements were made to maintain a high rate of artillery-fire during the offensive; munitions trains per day were to deliver ammunition sufficient for to be fired in the first six days and another in the next twelve. Five repair shops were built close to the front to reduce delays for maintenance and factories in Germany were made ready, rapidly to refurbish artillery needing more extensive repairs. A redeployment plan for the artillery was devised to move field guns and mobile heavy artillery forward, under the covering fire of mortars and the super- heavy artillery. A total of were massed on the Verdun front, two thirds of which were heavy- and super-heavy artillery, which was obtained by stripping the modern German artillery from the rest of the Western Front and substituting it with older types and captured Russian and Belgian guns. The German artillery could fire into the Verdun salient from three directions yet remain dispersed around the edges. =German plan of attack= The 5th Army divided the attack front into areas, A occupied by the VII Reserve Corps, B by the XVIII Corps, C by the III Corps and D on the Wo√´vre plain by the XV Corps. The preliminary artillery bombardment was to begin in the morning of 12 February. At , the infantry in areas A to C would advance in open order, supported by grenade and flame-thrower detachments. Wherever possible, the French advanced trenches were to be occupied and the second position reconnoitred for the artillery to bombard on the second day. Great emphasis was placed on limiting German infantry casualties by sending them to follow up destructive bombardments by the artillery, which was to carry the burden of the offensive in a series of large \\"attacks with limited objectives\\", to maintain a relentless pressure on the French. The initial objectives were the Meuse Heights, on a line from Froide Terre to Fort Souville and Fort Tavannes, which would provide a secure defensive position from which to repel French counter-attacks. \\"Relentless pressure\\" was a term added by the 5th Army staff and created ambiguity about the purpose of the offensive. Falkenhayn wanted land to be captured from which artillery could dominate the battlefield and the 5th Army wanted a quick capture of Verdun. The confusion caused by the ambiguity was left to the corps headquarters to sort out. Control of the artillery was centralised by an Order for the Activities of the Artillery and Mortars, which stipulated that the corps Generals of Foot Artillery were responsible for local target selection, while co-ordination of flanking fire by neighbouring corps and the fire of certain batteries, was reserved to the 5th Army headquarters. French fortifications were to be engaged by the heaviest howitzers and enfilade fire. The heavy artillery was to maintain long-range bombardment of French supply routes and assembly areas; counter- battery fire was reserved for specialist batteries firing gas shells. Co- operation between the artillery and infantry was stressed, with accuracy of the artillery being given priority over rate of fire. The opening bombardment was to build up slowly and (a rate of fire so rapid that the sound of shell- explosions merged into a rumble) would not begin until the last hour. As the infantry advanced, the artillery would increase the range of the bombardment to destroy the French second position. Artillery observers were to advance with the infantry and communicate with the guns by field telephones, flares and coloured balloons. When the offensive began, the French were to be bombarded continuously, with harassing fire being maintained at night. =French defensive preparations= In 1915, and of ammunition in the forts of the RFV had been removed, leaving only the heavy guns in retractable turrets. The conversion of the RFV to a conventional linear defence, with trenches and barbed wire began but proceeded slowly, after resources were sent west from Verdun for the Second Battle of Champagne In October 1915, building began on trench lines known as the first, second and third positions and in January 1916, an inspection by General No√´l de Castelnau, Chief of Staff at French General Headquarters (GQG), reported that the new defences were satisfactory, except for small deficiencies in three areas. The fortress garrisons had been reduced to small maintenance crews and some of the forts had been readied for demolition. The maintenance garrisons were responsible to the central military bureaucracy in Paris and when the XXX Corps commander, Major-General Paul Chr√©tien, attempted to inspect Fort Douaumont in January 1916, he was refused entry. Douaumont was the largest fort in the RFV and by February 1916, the only artillery left in the fort were the and guns and light guns covering the ditch. The fort was used as a barracks by under the command of Warrant-Officer Chenot, the . One of the rotating turrets was partially manned and the other was left empty. The Hotchkiss machine-guns were stored in boxes and four in the casemates had already been removed. The drawbridge had been jammed in the down position by a German shell and had not been repaired. The (wall bunkers) with Hotchkiss revolver-cannons protecting the moats, were unmanned and over of explosives had been placed in the fort to demolish it. Colonel √âmile Driant was stationed at Verdun and criticised Joseph Joffre for removing the artillery guns and infantry from fortresses around Verdun. Joffre did not listen but Colonel Driant received the support of the Minister for War Joseph Gallieni. What were supposed to be formidable defences an empty shell and now was threatened; and Driant was proved correct by the events. In late January 1916, French intelligence obtained an accurate assessment of German military capacity and intentions at Verdun but Joffre considered that an attack would be a diversion, because of the lack of an obvious strategic objective. By the time of the German offensive, Joffre expected a bigger attack elsewhere but finally yielded to political pressure and ordered the VII Corps to Verdun on 23 January, to hold the north face of the west bank. XXX Corps held the salient east of the Meuse to the north and north-east and II Corps held the eastern face of the Meuse Heights; Herr had divisions in the front line, with divisions in close reserve. (GAC, General De Langle de Cary) had the I and XX corps with two divisions each in reserve, plus most of the 19th Division; Joffre had in the French strategic reserve. French artillery reinforcements had brought the total at Verdun to guns and guns, against guns, two thirds of which were heavy and super heavy, including and some being . Eight specialist flame-thrower companies were also sent to the 5th Army. Castelnau met De Langle de Cary on 25 February, who doubted the east bank could be held. Castelnau disagreed and ordered General Fr√©d√©ric-Georges Herr the corps commander, to hold the right (east) bank of the Meuse at all costs. Herr sent a division from the west bank and ordered XXX Corps to hold a line from Bras to Douaumont, Vaux and Eix. P√©tain took over command of the defence of the RFV at with Colonel Maurice de Barescut as chief of staff and Colonel Bernard Serrigny as head of operations, only to hear that Fort Douaumont had fallen. P√©tain ordered the remaining Verdun forts to be re-garrisoned. Four groups were established, under the command of Generals Adolphe Guillaumat, Balfourier and Denis Duch√™ne on the right bank and Georges de Bazelaire on the left bank. A \\"line of resistance\\" was established on the east bank from Souville to Thiaumont, around Fort Douaumont to Fort Vaux, Moulainville and along the ridge of the Wo√´vre. On the west bank, the line ran from Cumi√®res to Mort Homme, C√¥te 304 and Avocourt. A \\"line of panic\\" was planned in secret as a final line of defence north of Verdun, through forts Belleville, St. Michel and Moulainville. I Corps and XX Corps arrived from 24 to 26 February, increasing the number of divisions in the RFV to . By 6 March, the arrival of the XIII, XXI, XIV and XXXIII corps had increased the total to divisions. Battle =First phase, 21 February ‚Äì 1 March= 21‚Äì26 February (Operation Judgement) was due to begin on 12 February but fog, heavy rain and high winds delayed the offensive until on 21 February, when a 10-hour artillery bombardment by began. The German artillery fired along a front about long by wide. The main concentration of fire was on the right (east) bank of the Meuse river. Twenty-six super-heavy, long-range guns, up to , fired on the forts and the city of Verdun; a rumble could be heard away. The bombardment was paused at midday, as a ruse to prompt French survivors to reveal themselves and German artillery-observation aircraft were able to fly over the battlefield unmolested by French aircraft. The III Corps, VII Corps and XVIII Corps attacked at ; the Germans used flamethrowers and stormtroopers followed closely with rifles slung, using hand grenades to kill the remaining defenders. This tactic had been developed by Captain Willy Rohr and , the battalion which conducted the attack. French survivors engaged the attackers, yet the Germans suffered only By 22 February German troops had advanced and captured at the edge of the village of Flabas. Two French battalions led by Colonel √âmile Driant had held the bois (wood) for two days but were forced back to Samogneux, Beaumont-en-Auge and Ornes. Driant was killed, fighting with the 56th and 59th and only the Chasseurs managed to escape. Poor communications meant that only then did the French High Command realise the seriousness of the attack. The Germans managed to take the village of Haumont but French forces repulsed a German attack on the village of . On 23 February, a French counter-attack at was repulsed. Fighting for continued until the Germans outflanked the French defenders from . The German attackers had many casualties during their attack on and the French held on to Samogneux. German attacks continued on 24 February and the French XXX Corps was forced out of the second line of defence; XX Corps (General Maurice Balfourier) arrived at the last minute and was rushed forward. That evening Castelnau advised Joffre that the Second Army, under General P√©tain, should be sent to the RFV. The Germans had captured Beaumont-en-Verdunois, and and were moving up , which led to Fort Douaumont. At on 25 February, infantry of Brandenburg Regiment 24 advanced with the II and III battalions side-by-side, each formed into two waves composed of two companies each. A delay in the arrival of orders to the regiments on the flanks, led to the III Battalion advancing without support on that flank. The Germans rushed French positions in the woods and on C√¥te 347, with the support of machine-gun fire from the edge of . The German infantry took many prisoners as the French on C√¥te 347 were outflanked and withdrew to Douaumont village. The German infantry had reached their objectives in fewer than twenty minutes and pursued the French, until fired on by a machine-gun in Douaumont church. Some German troops took cover in woods and a ravine which led to the fort, when German artillery began to bombard the area, the gunners having refused to believe claims sent by field telephone that the German infantry were within a few hundred metres of the fort. Several German parties were forced to advance to find cover from the German shelling and two parties independently made for the fort. They did not know that the French garrison was made up of only a small maintenance crew led by a warrant officer, since most of the Verdun forts had been partly disarmed, after the demolition of Belgian forts in 1914, by the German super-heavy Krupp 420 mm mortars. The German party of tried to signal to the artillery with flares but twilight and falling snow obscured them from view. Some of the party began to cut through the wire around the fort, while French machine-gun fire from Douaumont village ceased. The French had seen the German flares and took the Germans on the fort to be Zouaves retreating from C√¥te 378. The Germans were able to reach the north-east end of the fort before the French resumed firing. The German party found a way through the railings on top of the ditch and climbed down without being fired on, since the machine-gun bunkers () at each corner of the ditch had been left unmanned. The German parties continued and found a way inside the fort through one of the unoccupied ditch bunkers and then reached the central . After quietly moving inside, the Germans heard voices and persuaded a French prisoner, captured in an observation post, to lead them to the lower floor, where they found Warrant Officer Chenot and about troops, most of the skeleton garrison of the fort, and took them prisoner. On 26 February, the Germans had advanced on a front; French losses were and German losses were A French counter-attack on Fort Douaumont failed and P√©tain ordered that no more attempts were to be made; existing lines were to be consolidated and other forts were to be occupied, rearmed and supplied to withstand a siege if surrounded. 27‚Äì29 February The German advance gained little ground on 27 February, after a thaw turned the ground into a swamp and the arrival of French reinforcements increased the effectiveness of the defence. Some German artillery became unserviceable and other batteries became stranded in the mud. German infantry began to suffer from exhaustion and unexpectedly high losses, being suffered in the fighting around Douaumont village. On 29 February, the German advance was contained at Douaumont by a heavy snowfall and the defence of French 33rd Infantry Regiment. Delays gave the French time to bring up and of ammunition from the railhead at Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. The swift German advance had gone beyond the range of artillery covering fire and the muddy conditions made it very difficult to move the artillery forward as planned. The German advance southwards brought it into range of French artillery west of the Meuse, whose fire caused more German infantry casualties than in the earlier fighting, when French infantry on the east bank had fewer guns in support. =Second phase, 6 March ‚Äì 15 April= 6‚Äì11 March Before the offensive, Falkenhayn had expected that French artillery on the west bank would be suppressed by counter-battery fire but this had failed. The Germans set up a specialist artillery force to counter French artillery-fire from the west bank but this also failed to reduce German infantry casualties. The 5th Army asked for more troops in late February but Falkenhayn refused, due to the rapid advance already achieved on the east bank and because he needed the rest of the OHL reserve for an offensive elsewhere, once the attack at Verdun had attracted and consumed French reserves. The pause in the German advance on 27 February led Falkenhayn to have second thoughts to decide between terminating the offensive or reinforcing it. On 29 February, Knobelsdorf, the 5th Army Chief of Staff, prised two divisions from the OHL reserve, with the assurance that once the heights on the west bank had been occupied, the offensive on the east bank could be completed. The VI Reserve Corps was reinforced with the X Reserve Corps, to capture a line from the south of Avocourt to C√¥te 304 north of Esnes, Le Mort Homme, Bois des Cumi√®res and C√¥te 205, from which the French artillery on the west bank could be destroyed. The artillery of the two-corps assault group on the west bank was reinforced by artillery batteries, artillery command was centralised under one officer and arrangements were made for the artillery on the east bank to fire in support. The attack was planned by General Heinrich von Gossler in two parts, on Mort-Homme and C√¥te 265 on 6 March, followed by attacks on Avocourt and C√¥te 304 on 9 March. The German bombardment reduced the top of C√¥te 304 from a height of to ; Mort-Homme sheltered batteries of French field guns, which hindered German progress towards Verdun on the right bank; the hills also provided commanding views of the left bank. After storming the and then losing it to a French counter- attack, the Germans launched another assault on Mort-Homme on 9 March, from the direction of B√©thincourt to the north-west. was captured again at great cost in casualties, before the Germans took parts of Mort-Homme, C√¥te 304, Cumi√®res and Chattancourt on 14 March. 11 March ‚Äì 9 April After a week, the German attack had reached the first-day objectives, to find that French guns behind C√¥te de Marre and Bois Borrous were still operational and inflicting many casualties among the Germans on the east bank. German artillery moved to C√¥te 265, was subjected to systematic artillery-fire by the French, which left the Germans needing to implement the second part of the west bank offensive, to protect the gains of the first phase. German attacks changed from large operations on broad fronts, to narrow-front attacks with limited objectives. On 14 March a German attack captured C√¥te 265 at the west end of Mort-Homme but the French 75th Infantry Brigade managed to hold C√¥te 295 at the east end. On 20 March, after a bombardment by mortar rounds, the 11th Bavarian and 11th Reserve divisions attacked and and reached their initial objectives easily. Gossler ordered a pause in the attack, to consolidate the captured ground and to prepare another big bombardment for the next day. On 22 March, two divisions attacked \\"Termite Hill\\" near C√¥te 304 but were met by a mass of artillery-fire, which also fell on assembly points and the German lines of communication, ending the German advance. The limited German success had been costly and French artillery inflicted more casualties as the German infantry tried to dig in. By 30 March, Gossler had captured at a cost of and the Germans were still short of C√¥te 304. On 30 March, the XXII Reserve Corps arrived as reinforcements and General Max von Gallwitz took command of a new Attack Group West (). Malancourt village was captured on 31 March, Haucourt fell on 5 April and B√©thincourt on 8 April. On the east bank, German attacks near Vaux reached and the Vaux‚ÄìFleury railway but were then driven back by the French 5th Division. An attack was made on a wider front along both banks by the Germans at noon on 9 April, with five divisions on the left bank but this was repulsed except at Mort-Homme, where the French 42nd Division was forced back from the north-east face. On the right bank an attack on failed. In March the German attacks had no advantage of surprise and faced a determined and well-supplied adversary in superior defensive positions. German artillery could still devastate French defensive positions but could not prevent French artillery-fire from inflicting many casualties on German infantry and isolating them from their supplies. Massed artillery fire could enable German infantry to make small advances but massed French artillery-fire could do the same for French infantry when they counter-attacked, which often repulsed the German infantry and subjected them to constant losses, even when captured ground was held. The German effort on the west bank also showed that capturing a vital point was not sufficient, because it would be found to be overlooked by another terrain feature, which had to be captured to ensure the defence of the original point, which made it impossible for the Germans to terminate their attacks, unless they were willing to retire to the original front line of February 1916. By the end of March the offensive had cost the Germans and Falkenhayn began to think of ending the offensive, lest it become another costly and indecisive engagement similar to the First Battle of Ypres in late 1914. The 5th Army staff requested more reinforcements from Falkenhayn on 31 March with an optimistic report claiming that the French were close to exhaustion and incapable of a big offensive. The 5th Army command wanted to continue the east bank offensive until a line from Ouvrage de Thiaumont, to Fleury, Fort Souville and Fort de Tavannes had been reached, while on the west bank the French would be destroyed by their own counter-attacks. On 4 April, Falkenhayn replied that the French had retained a considerable reserve and that German resources were limited and not sufficient to replace continuously men and munitions. If the resumed offensive on the east bank failed to reach the Meuse Heights, Falkenhayn was willing to accept that the offensive had failed and end it. =Third phase, 16 April ‚Äì 1 July= April The failure of German attacks in early April by , led Knobelsdorf to take soundings from the 5th Army corps commanders, who unanimously wanted to continue. The German infantry were exposed to continuous artillery fire from the flanks and rear; communications from the rear and reserve positions were equally vulnerable, which caused a constant drain of casualties. Defensive positions were difficult to build, because existing positions were on ground which had been swept clear by German bombardments early in the offensive, leaving German infantry with very little cover. The XV Corps commander, General Berthold von Deimling also wrote that French heavy artillery and gas bombardments were undermining the morale of the German infantry, which made it necessary to keep going to reach safer defensive positions. Knobelsdorf reported these findings to Falkenhayn on 20 April, adding that if the Germans did not go forward, they must go back to the start line of 21 February. Knobelsdorf rejected the policy of limited piecemeal attacks tried by Mudra as commander of and advocated a return to wide-front attacks with unlimited objectives, swiftly to reach the line from Ouvrage de Thiaumont to Fleury, Fort Souville and Fort de Tavannes. Falkenhayn was persuaded to agree to the change and by the end of April, most of the OHL reserve, had been sent to Verdun and troops had also been transferred from the Eastern Front. The resort to large, unlimited attacks was costly for both sides but the German advance proceeded only slowly. Rather than causing devastating French casualties by heavy artillery with the infantry in secure defensive positions, which the French were compelled to attack, the Germans inflicted casualties by attacks which provoked French counter-attacks and assumed that the process inflicted five French casualties for two German losses. In mid-March, Falkenhayn had reminded the 5th Army to use tactics intended to conserve infantry, after the corps commanders had been allowed discretion to choose between the cautious, \\"step by step\\" tactics desired by Falkenhayn and maximum efforts, intended to obtain quick results. On the third day of the offensive, the 6th Division of the III Corps (General Ewald von Lochow), had ordered that Herbebois be taken regardless of loss and the 5th Division had attacked Wavrille to the accompaniment of its band. Falkenhayn urged the 5th Army to use (storm units) composed of two infantry squads and one of engineers, armed with automatic weapons, hand grenades, trench mortars and flame-throwers, to advance in front of the main infantry body. The would conceal their advance by shrewd use of terrain and capture any blockhouses which remained after the artillery preparation. Strongpoints which could not be taken were to be by-passed and captured by follow-up troops. Falkenhayn ordered that the command of field and heavy artillery units was to be combined, with a commander at each corps headquarters. Common observers and communication systems would ensure that batteries in different places could bring targets under converging fire, which would be allotted systematically to support divisions. In mid-April, Falkenhayn ordered that infantry should advance close to the barrage, to exploit the neutralising effect of the shellfire on surviving defenders, because fresh troops at Verdun had not been trained in these methods. Knobelsdorf persisted with attempts to maintain momentum, which was incompatible with casualty conservation by limited attacks, with pauses to consolidate and prepare. Mudra and other commanders who disagreed were sacked. Falkenhayn also intervened to change German defensive tactics, advocating a dispersed defence with the second line to be held as a main line of resistance and jumping-off point for counter-attacks. Machine-guns were to be set up with overlapping fields of fire and infantry given specific areas to defend. When French infantry attacked, they were to be isolated by (barrage-fire) on their former front line, to increase French infantry casualties. The changes desired by Falkenhayn had little effect, because the main cause of German casualties was artillery-fire, just as it was for the French. 4‚Äì22 May From 10 May German operations were limited to local attacks, either in reply to French counter-attacks on 11 April between Douaumont and Vaux and on 17 April between the Meuse and Douaumont, or local attempts to take points of tactical value. At the beginning of May, General P√©tain was promoted to the command of (GAC) and General Robert Nivelle took over the Second Army at Verdun. From 4 to 24 May, German attacks were made on the west bank around Mort-Homme and on 4 May, the north slope of C√¥te 304 was captured; French counter-attacks from 5 to 6 May were repulsed. The French defenders on the crest of C√¥te 304 were forced back on 7 May but German infantry were unable to occupy the ridge, because of the intensity of French artillery-fire. Cumieres and Caurettes fell on 24 May as a French counter-attack began at Fort Douaumont. 22‚Äì24 May In May, General Nivelle, who had taken over the Second Army, ordered General Charles Mangin, commander of the 5th Division to plan a counter-attack on Fort Douaumont. The initial plan was for an attack on a front but several minor German attacks captured the and ravines on the south-east and west sides of the fort. A further attack took the ridge south of the , which gave the Germans better routes for counter-attacks and observation over the French lines to the south and south-west. Mangin proposed a preliminary attack to retake the area of the ravines, to obstruct the routes by which a German counter-attack on the fort could be made. More divisions were necessary but these were refused to preserve the troops needed for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme; Mangin was limited to one division for the attack with one in reserve. Nivelle reduced the attack to an assault on Morch√©e Trench, Bonnet-d'Ev√®que, Fontaine Trench, Fort Douaumont, a machine-gun turret and Hongrois Trench, which would require an advance of on a front. III Corps was to command the attack by the 5th Division and the 71st Brigade, with support from three balloon companies for artillery-observation and a fighter group. The main effort was to be conducted by two battalions of the 129th Infantry Regiment, each with a pioneer company and a machine-gun company attached. The 2nd Battalion was to attack from the south and the 1st Battalion was to move along the west side of the fort to the north end, taking Fontaine Trench and linking with the 6th Company. Two battalions of the 74th Infantry Regiment were to advance along the east and south-east sides of the fort and take a machine-gun turret on a ridge to the east. Flank support was arranged with neighbouring regiments and diversions were planned near Fort Vaux and the . Preparations for the attack included the digging of of trenches and the building of large numbers of depots and stores but little progress was made due to a shortage of pioneers. French troops captured on 13 May, disclosed the plan to the Germans, who responded by subjecting the area to more artillery harassing fire, which also slowed French preparations. The French preliminary bombardment by four mortars and guns, began on 17 May and by 21 May, the French artillery commander claimed that the fort had been severely damaged. During the bombardment the German garrison in the fort experienced great strain, as French heavy shells smashed holes in the walls and concrete dust, exhaust fumes from an electricity generator and gas from disinterred corpses polluted the air. Water ran short but until 20 May, the fort remained operational, reports being passed back and reinforcements moving forward until the afternoon, when the Bourges Casemate was isolated and the wireless station in the north-western machine-gun turret burnt down. Conditions for the German infantry in the vicinity were far worse and by 18 May, the French destructive bombardment had obliterated many defensive positions, the survivors sheltering in shell-holes and dips of the ground. Communication with the rear was severed and food and water ran out by the time of the French attack on 22 May. The troops of Infantry Regiment 52 in front of Fort Douaumont had been reduced to near Thiaumont Farm and German counter-barrages inflicted similar losses on French troops. On 22 May, French Nieuport fighters attacked eight observation balloons and shot down six for the loss of one Nieuport 16; other French aircraft attacked the 5th Army headquarters at Stenay. German artillery fire increased and twenty minutes before zero hour, a German bombardment began, which reduced the 129th Infantry Regiment companies to about each. The assault began at on 22 May on a front. On the left flank the 36th Infantry Regiment attack quickly captured Morch√©e Trench and Bonnet-d'Ev√®que but suffered many casualties and the regiment could advance no further. The flank guard on the right was pinned down, except for one company which disappeared and in , a battalion of the 74th Infantry Regiment was unable to leave its trenches; the other battalion managed to reach its objectives at an ammunition depot, shelter DV1 at the edge of and the machine-gun turret east of the fort, where the battalion found its flanks unsupported. Despite German small-arms fire, the 129th Infantry Regiment reached the fort in a few minutes and managed to get in through the west and south sides. By nightfall, about half of the fort had been recaptured and next day, the 34th Division was sent to reinforce the French troops in the fort. The attempt to reinforce the fort failed and German reserves managed to cut off the French troops inside and force them to surrender, prisoners being taken. After three days, the French had suffered from the in the attack and the Germans suffered in Infantry Regiment 52, Grenadier Regiment 12 and Leib-Grenadier Regiment 8 of the 5th Division. 30 May ‚Äì 7 June File:Panorama de Verdun, vue prise du Fort de la Chaume, 1917.jpgVerdun battlefield from Fort de la Chaume, looking north‚Äìeast, 1917 Later in May 1916, the German attacks shifted from the left bank at Mort-Homme and C√¥te 304 to the right bank, south of Fort Douaumont. A German attack to reach Fleury Ridge, the last French defensive line began. The attack was intended to capture , Fleury, Fort Souville and Fort Vaux at the north-east extremity of the French line, which had been bombarded by a day since the beginning of the offensive. After a final assault on 1 June by about troops, the top of Fort Vaux was occupied on 2 June. Fighting went on underground until the garrison ran out of water, the surrendering on 7 June. When news of the loss of Fort Vaux reached Verdun, the Line of Panic was occupied and trenches were dug on the edge of the city. On the left bank, the German advanced from the line C√¥te 304, Mort-Homme and Cumi√®res and threatened the French hold on Chattancourt and Avocourt. Heavy rains slowed the German advance towards Fort Souville, where both sides attacked and counter-attacked for the next two months. The 5th Army suffered in the vicinity of Fort Vaux from 1 to 10 June, being killed, and French counter-attacks on 8 and 9 June were costly failures. 22‚Äì25 June On 22 June, German artillery fired over (Green Cross) gas shells at French artillery positions, which caused over and silenced many of the French guns. Next day at the Germans attacked on a front and drove a salient into the French defences. The advance was unopposed until when some French troops were able to fight a rearguard action. The Ouvrage (shelter) de Thiaumont and the Ouvrage de Froidterre at the south end of the plateau were captured and the villages of Fleury and Chapelle Sainte- Fine were overrun. The attack came close to Fort Souville (which had been hit by since April) bringing the Germans within of the Verdun citadel. On 23 June 1916, Nivelle ordered, Nivelle had been concerned about declining French morale at Verdun; after his promotion to lead the Second Army in June 1916, , manifestations of indiscipline, occurred in five front line regiments. reappeared in the French army mutinies that followed the Nivelle Offensive (April‚ÄìMay 1917). Chapelle Sainte-Fine was quickly recaptured by the French and the German advance was halted. The supply of water to the German infantry broke down, the salient was vulnerable to fire from three sides and the attack could not continue without more Diphosgene ammunition. Chapelle Sainte-Fine became the furthest point reached by the Germans during the Verdun offensive. On 24 June the preliminary Anglo-French bombardment began on the Somme. Fleury changed hands sixteen times from 23 June to 17 August and four French divisions were diverted to Verdun from the Somme. The French artillery recovered sufficiently on 24 June to cut off the German front line from the rear. By 25 June, both sides were exhausted and Knobelsdorf suspended the attack. =Fourth phase 1 July ‚Äì 17 December= By the end of May French casualties at Verdun had risen to and in June German losses had reached The opening of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July, forced the Germans to withdraw some of their artillery from Verdun, which was the first strategic success of the Anglo-French offensive. 9‚Äì15 July Fort Souville dominated a crest south-east of Fleury and was one of the original objectives of the February offensive. The capture of the fort would give the Germans control of the heights overlooking Verdun and allow the infantry to dig in on commanding ground. A German preparatory bombardment began on 9 July, with an attempt to suppress French artillery with over shells, which had little effect since the French had been equipped with an improved M2 gas mask. Fort Souville and its approaches were bombarded with more than including shells on the fort. An attack by three German divisions began on 11 July but German infantry bunched on the path leading to Fort Souville and came under bombardment from French artillery. The surviving troops were fired on by sixty French machine-gunners, who emerged from the fort and took positions on the superstructure. Thirty soldiers of Infantry Regiment 140 managed to reach the top of the fort on 12 July, from where the Germans could see the roofs of Verdun and the spire of the cathedral. After a small French counter-attack, the survivors retreated to their start lines or surrendered. On the evening of 11 July, Crown Prince Wilhelm was ordered by Falkenhayn to go onto the defensive and on 15 July, the French conducted a larger counter-attack which gained no ground; for the rest of the month the French made only small attacks. 1 August ‚Äì 17 September On 1 August a German surprise-attack advanced towards Fort Souville, which prompted French counter-attacks for two weeks, which were only able to retake a small amount of the captured ground. On 18 August, Fleury was recaptured and by September, French counter-attacks had recovered much of the ground lost in July and August. On 29 August Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Paul von Hindenburg and First Quartermaster-General Erich Ludendorff. On 3 September, an attack on both flanks at Fleury advanced the French line several hundred metres, against which German counter-attacks from failed. The French attacked again on Losses were light except at the Tavannes railway tunnel, where troops died in a fire which began on 4 September. 20 October ‚Äì 2 November In October 1916 the French began the First Offensive Battle of Verdun (), to recapture Fort Douaumont, an advance of more than . Seven of the at Verdun were replaced by mid-October and French infantry platoons were reorganised to contain sections of riflemen, grenadiers and machine-gunners. In a six-day preliminary bombardment, the French artillery fired including more than half a million field-gun shells, a hundred thousand medium artillery shells and three hundred and seventy-three and super-heavy shells, from more than and howitzers. Two French Saint-Chamond railway guns, to the south-west at Baleycourt, fired the super-heavy shells, each weighing . The French had identified about guns on the right bank capable of supporting the 34th, 54th, 9th and 33rd Reserve divisions, with the 10th and 5th divisions in reserve. At least the super-heavy shells hit Fort Douaumont, the sixth penetrating to the lowest level and exploding in a pioneer depot, starting a fire next to The 38th Division (General Guyot de Salins), 133rd Division (General Fenelon F.G. Passaga) and 74th Division (General Charles de Lardemelle) attacked at The infantry advanced behind a creeping field-artillery barrage, moving at a rate of in two minutes, beyond which a heavy artillery barrage moved in lifts, as the field artillery barrage came within , to force the German infantry and machine-gunners to stay under cover. The Germans had partly evacuated Douaumont, which was recaptured on 24 October by French marines and colonial infantry; more than and fifteen guns were captured by 25 October but an attempt on Fort Vaux failed. The Haudromont quarries, Ouvrage de Thiaumont and Thiaumont Farm, Douaumont village, the northern end of Caillette Wood, Vaux pond, the eastern fringe of Bois Fumin and the Damloup battery were captured. The heaviest French artillery bombarded Fort Vaux for the next week and on 2 November, the Germans evacuated the fort, after a huge explosion caused by a French eavesdroppers overheard a German wireless message announcing the departure and a French infantry company entered the fort without firing a shot; on 5 November, the French reached the front line of 24 February and offensive operations ceased until December. 15‚Äì17 December 1916 The Second Offensive Battle of Verdun () was planned by P√©tain and Nivelle and commanded by Mangin. The 126th Division (General Paul Muteau), 38th Division (General Guyot de Salins), 37th Division (General No√´l Garnier-Duplessix) and the 133rd Division (General F√©nelon Passaga) attacked with four more in reserve and guns in support. The attack began at on 15 December, after a six-day bombardment of fired from The final French bombardment was directed from artillery-observation aircraft, falling on trenches, dugout entrances and observation posts. Five German divisions supported by held the defensive position, which was deep, with of the infantry in the battle zone and the remaining in reserve back. Two of the German divisions were understrength with only instead of their normal establishment of The French advance was preceded by a double creeping barrage, with shrapnel-fire from field artillery in front of the infantry and a high- explosive barrage ahead, which moved towards a standing shrapnel bombardment along the German second line, laid to cut off the German retreat and block the advance of reinforcements. The German defence collapsed and of the the five front divisions were lost, most having been trapped while under cover and taken prisoner when the French infantry arrived. The French reached their objectives at Vacherauville and Louvemont which had been lost in February, along with Hardaumont and Louvemont-C√¥te-du-Poivre, despite attacking in very bad weather. German reserve battalions did not reach the front until the evening and two divisions, which had been ordered forward the previous evening, were still away at noon. By the night of the French had consolidated a new line from Bezonvaux to C√¥te du Poivre, beyond Douaumont and north of Fort Vaux, before the German reserves and units could counter-attack. The at Douaumont had been repaired and fired in support of the French attack. The closest German point to Verdun had been pushed back and all the dominating observation points had been recaptured. The French took and Some German officers complained to Mangin about their lack of comfort in captivity and he replied, We do regret it, gentlemen, but then we did not expect so many of you. Lochow, the 5th Army commander and General Hans von Zwehl, commander of XIV Reserve Corps, were sacked on 16 December. Aftermath =Analysis= Falkenhayn wrote in his memoir that he sent an appreciation of the strategic situation to the Kaiser in December 1915, The German strategy in 1916 was to inflict mass casualties on the French, a goal achieved against the Russians from 1914 to 1915, to weaken the French Army to the point of collapse. The French Army had to be drawn into circumstances from which it could not escape, for reasons of strategy and prestige. The Germans planned to use a large number of heavy and super-heavy guns to inflict a greater number of casualties than French artillery, which relied mostly upon the gun. In 2007, Robert Foley wrote that Falkenhayn intended a battle of attrition from the beginning, contrary to the views of Wolfgang Foerster in 1937, Gerd Krumeich in 1996 and others but the loss of documents led to many interpretations of the strategy. In 1916, critics of Falkenhayn claimed that the battle demonstrated that he was indecisive and unfit for command, echoed by Foerster in 1937. In 1994, Holger Afflerbach questioned the authenticity of the \\"Christmas Memorandum\\"; after studying the evidence that had survived in the (Army Military History Research Institute) files, he concluded that the memorandum had been written after the war but that it was an accurate reflection of Falkenhayn's thinking at the time. Krumeich wrote that the Christmas Memorandum was fabricated to justify a failed strategy and that attrition had been substituted for the capture of Verdun, only after the attack failed. Foley wrote that after the failure of the Ypres Offensive of 1914, Falkenhayn had returned to the pre-war strategic thinking of Moltke the Elder and Hans Delbr√ºck on (attrition strategy), because the coalition fighting Germany was too powerful to be defeated decisively. Falkenhayn wanted to divide the Allies by forcing at least one of the Entente powers into a negotiated peace. An attempt at attrition lay behind the offensive in the east in 1915 but the Russians had refused to accept German peace feelers, despite the huge defeats inflicted by the Austro-Germans. With insufficient forces to break through the Western Front and overcome the reserves behind it, Falkenhayn tried to force the French to attack instead, by threatening a sensitive point close to the front line and chose Verdun. Huge losses were to be inflicted on the French by German artillery on the dominating heights around the city. The 5th Army would begin a big offensive but with the objectives limited to seizing the Meuse Heights on the east bank for German heavy artillery to dominate the battlefield. The French Army would \\"bleed itself white\\" in hopeless counter- attacks. The British would be forced to launch a hasty relief offensive and suffer an equally costly defeat. If the French refused to negotiate, a German offensive would mop up the remnants of the Franco-British armies, breaking the Entente \\"once and for all\\". In a revised instruction to the French Army in January 1916, the General Staff (GQG) wrote that equipment could not be fought by men. Firepower could conserve infantry but attrition prolonged the war and consumed troops preserved in earlier battles. In 1915 and early 1916, German industry quintupled the output of heavy artillery and doubled the production of super-heavy artillery. French production had also recovered since 1914 and by February 1916 the army had guns. In May Joffre began to issue each division with two groups of and each corps with four groups of long-range guns. Both sides at Verdun had the means to fire huge numbers of heavy shells to suppress the opposing defences before risking infantry in the open. At the end of May, the Germans had guns at Verdun and the sufficient to contain the Germans but not enough for a counter-offensive. French infantry survived bombardment better because their positions were dispersed and tended to be on dominating ground, not always visible. As soon as a German attack began, the French replied with machine-gun and rapid field-artillery fire. On 22 April, the Germans suffered and in mid-April, the French fired artillery shells against an attack to the south-east of Fort Douaumont. A few days after taking over at Verdun, P√©tain ordered the air commander, Commandant Charles Tricornot de Rose to sweep away German fighter aircraft and to provide artillery-observation. German air superiority was reversed by concentrating the French fighters in rather than distributing them piecemeal across the front, unable to concentrate against large German formations. The fighter escadrilles drove away the German Fokker Eindeckers and the two-seater reconnaissance and artillery-observation aircraft that they protected. The fighting at Verdun was less costly to both sides than the war of movement in 1914, when the French suffered and the Germans from August to the end of 1914. The 5th Army had a lower rate of loss than armies on the Eastern Front in 1915 and the French had a lower average rate of loss at Verdun than the rate over three weeks during the Second Battle of Champagne (September‚ÄìOctober 1915), which were not fought as battles of attrition. German loss rates increased relative to losses from early 1915 to close to the end of the battle, which continued during the Nivelle Offensive in 1917. The penalty of attrition tactics was indecision, because limited-objective attacks under an umbrella of massed heavy artillery- fire could succeed but led to battles of unlimited duration. P√©tain used a (rotation) system quickly to relieve French troops at Verdun, which involved most of the French Army in the battle but for shorter periods than German troops. The symbolic importance of Verdun proved a rallying point and the army did not collapse. Falkenhayn was forced to conduct the offensive for much longer and commit far more infantry than intended. By the end of April, most of the German strategic reserve was at Verdun, suffering similar casualties to the French army. The Germans believed that they were inflicting losses at a rate of military intelligence thought that by 11 March the French had suffered and Falkenhayn was confident that German artillery could easily inflict another In May, Falkenhayn estimated that French casualties had increased to against and that the French strategic reserve was down to Actual French losses were 1 May; divisions had been withdrawn and rested by the system, once infantry casualties reached Of the battalions of the French metropolitan army, went to Verdun, against divisions, of the (western army). Afflerbach wrote that divisions fought at Verdun and that from February to August, the ratio of German to French losses was not the third of French losses assumed by Falkenhayn. By 31 August, the 5th Army has suffered and the French In June 1916, the French had at Verdun, including guns; from February to December, the French and German armies fired weighing . By May, the German offensive had been defeated by French reinforcements, difficulties of terrain and the weather. The 5th Army infantry was stuck in tactically dangerous positions, overlooked by the French on both banks of the Meuse, instead of dug in on the Meuse Heights. French casualties were inflicted by constant infantry attacks which were far more costly in men than destroying counter-attacks with artillery. The stalemate was broken by the Brusilov Offensive and the Anglo- French relief offensive on the Somme, which Falkehayn had expected to begin the collapse of the Anglo-French armies. Falkenhayn had begun to remove divisions from the Western Front in June to rebuild the strategic reserve but only twelve divisions could be spared. Four divisions were sent to the Somme, where three defensive positions had been built, based on the experience of the . Before the battle on the Somme began, Falkenhayn thought that German preparations were better than ever and the British offensive would easily be defeated. The 6th Army, further north, had divisions and plenty of heavy artillery, ready to attack once the British had been defeated. The strength of the Anglo-French attack on the Somme surprised Falkenhayn and his staff, despite the British casualties. Artillery losses to \\"overwhelming\\" Anglo- French counter-battery fire and instant counter-attacks led to far more German infantry casualties than at the height of the fighting at Verdun, where the 5th Army suffered in the first ten days, against Army casualties on the Somme. The Russians attacked again, causing more casualties in June and July. Falkenhayn was called on to justify his strategy to the Kaiser on 8 July and again advocated the minimal reinforcement of the east in favour of the \\"decisive\\" battle in France; the Somme offensive was the \\"last throw of the dice\\" for the Entente. Falkenhayn had already given up the plan for a counter- offensive by the 6th Army and sent 18 divisions to the 2nd Army and the Russian front from reserve and the 6th Army, only one division remaining uncommitted by the end of August. The 5th Army had been ordered to limit its attacks at Verdun in June but a final effort was made in July to capture Fort Souville. The effort failed and on 12 July Falkenhayn ordered a strict defensive policy, permitting only small local attacks to limit the number of troops the French could transfer to the Somme. Falkenhayn had underestimated the French, for whom victory at all costs was the only way to justify the sacrifices already made; the French army never came close to collapse and triggering a premature British relief offensive. The ability of the German army to inflict disproportionate losses had also been overestimated, in part because the 5th Army commanders had tried to capture Verdun and attacked regardless of loss. Even when reconciled to the attrition strategy, they continued with (strategy of annihilation) and the tactics of (manoeuvre warfare). Failure to reach the Meuse Heights left the 5th Army in poor tactical positions and reduced to inflicting casualties by infantry attacks and counter-attacks. The length of the offensive made Verdun a matter of prestige for the Germans as it was for the French and Falkenhayn became dependent on a British relief offensive being destroyed to end the stalemate. When it came, the collapse in Russia and the power of the Anglo-French attack on the Somme reduced the German armies to holding their positions as best they could. On 29 August, Falkenhayn was sacked and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who ended the German offensive at Verdun on 2 September. =Casualties= In 2013, Paul Jankowski wrote that since the beginning of the war, French army units had produced numerical loss states () every five days for the Bureau of Personnel at GQG. The Health Service () at the Ministry of War received daily counts of wounded taken in by hospitals and other services but casualty data was dispersed among regimental depots, GQG, the Registry Office (), which recorded deaths, the , which counted injuries and illnesses, and (Family Liaison), which communicated with next of kin. Regimental depots were ordered to keep (position sheets) to record losses continuously and the of GQG began to compare the five-day with the records of hospital admissions. The new system was used to calculate losses back to August 1914, which took several months; the system had become established by February 1916. The were used to calculate casualty figures published in the , the French Official History and other publications. The German armies compiled (loss lists) every ten days, which were published by the in the of 1924‚Äì1925. German medical units kept detailed records of medical treatment at the front and in hospital and in 1923 the (Central Information Office) published an amended edition of the lists produced during the war, incorporating medical service data not in the . Monthly figures of wounded and ill servicemen that received medical treatment were published in 1934 in the (Medical Report). Using such sources for comparison is difficult, because the information recorded losses over time, rather than place. Losses calculated for a battle could be inconsistent, as in the Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire during the Great War 1914‚Äì1920 (1922). In the early 1920s, Louis Marin reported to the Chamber of Deputies but could not give figures per battle, except for some by using numerical reports from the armies, which were unreliable unless reconciled with the system established in 1916. Some French data excluded those lightly wounded but some did not. In April 1917, GQG required that the discriminate between lightly wounded, treated locally for 20 to 30 days and severely wounded evacuated to hospitals. Uncertainty over the criteria had not been resolved before the war ended. excluded lightly wounded and the records included them. Churchill revised German statistics by adding for unrecorded wounded in The World Crisis, written in the 1920s and James Edmonds, the British official historian, For the Battle of Verdun, the contained incomplete data for the Verdun area, did not define \\"wounded\\" and the 5th Army field reports exclude them. The Marin Report and covered different periods but included lightly wounded. Churchill used a figure of and took a figure of from the Marin Report, for March to June and November to December 1916, for all the Western Front. The give French casualties as and in 1930, Hermann Wendt recorded French Second Army and German 5th Army casualties of respectively from , not taking account of the inclusion or exclusion of lightly wounded. In 2006, McRandle and Quirk used the to increase the by , which gave compared to the French Official History record to 20 December 1916, of casualties. The , which explicitly excluded lightly wounded, compared German losses at Verdun in 1916, averaging per thousand men, with the 9th Army in Poland 1914 which had a casualty average of the 11th Army in Galicia 1915 averaging , the 1st Army on the Somme 1916 average of and the 2nd Army average for the Somme 1916 of Jankowski estimated an equivalent figure for the French Second Army of including lightly wounded. With a adjustment to the German figure of to include lightly wounded, following the views of McRandle and Quirk; the loss rate is similar to the estimate for French casualties. In the second edition of The World Crisis (1938), Churchill wrote that the figure of for other ranks and the figure of \\"probably\\" included officers. Churchill gave a figure of and expressed dismay that French casualties had exceeded German by Churchill wrote that an eighth needed to be deducted from his figures to account for casualties on other sectors, giving and casualties. In 1980, John Terraine calculated casualties in Dupuy and Dupuy (1993) casualties. In 2000, Hannes Heer and Klaus Naumann calculated and casualties, a monthly average of In 2000, Holger Afflerbach used calculations made by Hermann Wendt in 1931 to give German casualties at Verdun from 21 February to 31 August 1916 to give and casualties at Verdun from February to December 1916. David Mason wrote in 2000 that there had been and casualties. In 2003, Anthony Clayton quoted casualties, of whom killed or missing; the French suffered or prisoners and Souvenir of the battle showing a French soldier. Writing in 2005, Robert Doughty gave French casualties (21 February to 20 December 1916) as and casualties of Verdun and the Somme; of the casualties at Verdun were fatal, were wounded and missing, many of whom were eventually presumed dead. Doughty wrote that other historians had followed Winston Churchill (1927) who gave a figure of by mistakenly including all French losses on the Western Front. R. G. Grant gave a figure of and casualties in 2005. In 2005, Robert Foley used the Wendt calculations of 1931 to give German casualties at Verdun from 21 February to 31 August 1916 of (In 2014, William Philpott recorded casualties, of whom had been killed; German casualties were and noted a recent estimate of casualties at Verdun from 1914 to 1918 of ). =Morale= Fighting in such a small area devastated the land, resulting in miserable conditions for troops on both sides. Rain and the constant artillery bombardments turned the clayey soil into a wasteland of mud full of debris and human remains. Shell craters filled with water and soldiers risked drowning in them. Forests were reduced to tangled piles of wood by constant artillery fire and eventually obliterated entirely. The effect of the battle was devastating, and many men broke down with shell shock. Some French soldiers tried to desert to Spain, and faced court-martial and execution; on 20 March, French deserters disclosed details of the French defences to the Germans, who were able to surround and force them to surrender. A French lieutenant wrote, \\"Humanity is mad. It must be mad to do what it is doing. What a massacre! What scenes of horror and carnage! I cannot find words to translate my impressions. Hell cannot be so terrible. Men are mad!\\" (Diary 23 May 1916) Discontent began to spread among French troops at Verdun and after the promotion of P√©tain from the Second Army on 1 June and his replacement by Nivelle, five infantry regiments were affected by episodes of \\"collective indiscipline\\"; Lieutenants Henri Herduin and Pierre Millant were summarily shot on 11 June and Nivelle published an Order of the Day forbidding surrender. =Subsequent operations= 20‚Äì26 August 1917 An attack on fronts on both sides of the Meuse was planned, XIII Corps and XVI Corps to attack on the left bank with two divisions each and two in reserve. C√¥te 304, Mort-Homme and C√¥te de l'Oie were to be captured in a advance. On the right (east) bank, XV Corps and XXXII Corps were to advance a similar distance and take C√¥te de Talou, hills 344, 326 and the Bois de Cauri√®res. About of wide road was rebuilt and paved for the supply of ammunition, along with a branch of the light railway. The French artillery prepared the attack with guns, guns and howitzers and guns and howitzers. The crowded 16 of fighter aircraft into the area to escort reconnaissance aircraft and protect observation balloons. The 5th Army had spent a year improving their defences at Verdun, including the excavation of tunnels linking Mort-Homme with the rear for supplies to be delivered and infantry to move with impunity. On the right bank, the Germans had developed four defensive positions, the last on the French front line of early 1916. Strategic surprise was impossible; the Germans had batteries in the area, bombarded frequently French positions with the new Mustard gas and made several spoiling attacks to disrupt French preparations. The French counter-attacked but Fayolle eventually limited ripostes to important ground only, the rest to be retaken during the main attack. A preliminary bombardment began on 11 August and the destructive bombardment began two days later but poor weather led to the infantry attack being put back to 20 August. The assembly of the 25th, 16th, and 31st divisions was obstructed by German gas bombardments but their attack captured all but Hill 304, which fell on 24 August. On the right bank, XV Corps had to cross the -wide C√¥te de Talou in the middle of no man's land. The French infantry reached their objectives except for a trench between hills 344, 326 and Samogneux, which was taken on 23 August. XXXII Corps reached its objectives in a costly advance but the troops found themselves too close to German trenches and under guns on high ground between Bezonvaux and Ornes. The French took for the loss of or missing. 7‚Äì8 September Guillaumat was ordered to plan an operation to capture several trenches and a more ambitious offensive on the east bank to take the last ground from which German artillery-observers could see Verdun. P√©tain questioned Guillaumat and Fayolle, who criticised the selection of objectives on the right bank and argued that the French must go on or go back. The Germans counter-attacked from higher ground several times in September; holding the ground captured in August proved more costly than taking it. Fayolle advocated a limited advance to make German counter-attacks harder, improve conditions in the front line and deceive the Germans about French intentions. A XV Corps attack on 7 September failed and on 8 September XXXII Corps gained a costly success. The attack continued and the trenches necessary for a secure defensive position were taken but not the last German observation point. More attacks were met by massed artillery-fire and counter-attacks and the French ended the operation. On 25 November after a five-hour hurricane bombardment, the 128th and 37th divisions, supported by and artillery groups conducted a raid on a front in appalling weather. A line of pillboxes were demolished and the infantry returned to their positions. Meuse‚ÄìArgonne Offensive The French Fourth Army and the American First Army attacked on a front from Moronvilliers to the Meuse on 26 September 1918 at after a three-hour bombardment. American troops quickly captured Malancourt, Bethincourt and Forges on the left bank of the Meuse and by midday the Americans had reached Gercourt, Cuisy, the southern part of Montfaucon and Cheppy. German troops were able to repulse American attacks on Montfaucon ridge, until it was outflanked to the south and Montfaucon was surrounded. German counter-attacks from slowed the American advance but Ivoiry and Epinon-Tille were captured, then Montfaucon ridge with and On the right bank of the Meuse, a combined Franco-American force under American command, took Brabant, Haumont, Bois d'Haumont and Bois des Caures and then crossed the front line of February 1916. By November, and several thousand machine-guns had been captured. A German retreat began and continued until the Armistice. Commemoration Verdun has become for the French the representative memory of World War I, comparable to how the Battle of the Somme is viewed in the United Kingdom and Canada. Antoine Prost wrote, \\"Like Auschwitz, Verdun marks a transgression of the limits of the human condition\\". From 1918 to 1939, the French expressed two memories of the battle. One was a patriotic view embodied in memorials built on the battlefield and the Nivelle quote \\"They shall not pass\\". The other was the memory of the survivors who recalled the death, suffering and sacrifice of others. Verdun soon became a focal point for commemorations of the war. In 1920, a ceremony was held in the citadel of Verdun to choose a body to bury in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe.8 novembre 1920 : La citadelle accueille des soldats d‚Äôidentit√©s inconnus, mais de nationalit√© fran√ßaise garantie. Six destroyed villages in the area were not rebuilt, but were given special status as uninhabited communes of Beaumont-en-Verdunois, Bezonvaux, Cumi√®res-le-Mort- Homme, Fleury-devant-Douaumont, Haumont-pr√®s-Samogneux and Louvemont-C√¥te-du- Poivre. Alain Denizot included period photographs that show overlapping shell craters in an area of about . Forests planted in the 1930s have grown up and hide most of the (Red Zone) but the battlefield remains a vast graveyard, containing the mortal remains of over soldiers, unless discovered by the French Forestry Service and laid in the Douaumont ossuary. The Verdun Memorial opened in 1967 and is located near Fleury-devant-Douaumont. It commemorates both the French and German losses and includes a museum.Sherman, Daniel J. The Construction of Memory in Interwar France (in English) University of Chicago Press. In the 1960s, Verdun became a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation, through remembrance of common suffering and in the 1980s it became a capital of peace. Organisations were formed and old museums were dedicated to the ideals of peace and human rights. On 22 September 1984, the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (whose father had fought near Verdun) and French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand (who had been taken prisoner nearby in World War II), stood at the Douaumont cemetery, holding hands for several minutes in driving rain as a gesture of Franco-German reconciliation.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk, or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing. Prog is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, long albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music. The genre coincided with the mid-1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists, as well as the new journalistic division between \\"pop\\" and \\"rock\\" that lent generic significance to both terms. Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid-1970s, but faded soon after. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this, but several more factors contributed to the decline. Music critics, who often labelled the concepts as \\"pretentious\\" and the sounds as \\"pompous\\" and \\"overblown\\", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it. After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into symphonic pop, arena rock, or new wave. Early groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as \\"proto-prog\\". The Canterbury scene, originating in the late 1960s, denotes a subset of prog bands who emphasised the use of wind instruments, complex chord changes and long improvisations. Rock in Opposition, from the late 1970s, was more avant- garde, and when combined with the Canterbury style, created avant-prog. In the 1980s, a new subgenre, neo-progressive rock, enjoyed some commercial success, although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation. Post-progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant- garde since the mid 1970s. Definition and characteristics =Scope and related terms= The term \\"progressive rock\\" is synonymous with \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" (not to be confused with classic rock), and \\"symphonic rock\\". Historically, \\"art rock\\" has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music. The first is progressive rock as it is generally understood, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist, avant- garde approach. Similarities between the two terms are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. However, art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant- garde influences. \\"Prog\\" was devised in the 1990s as a shorthand term, but later became a transferable adjective, also suggesting a wider palette than that drawn on by the most popular 1970s bands. Progressive rock is varied and is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, tapping into broader cultural resonances that connect to avant-garde art, classical music and folk music, performance and the moving image. Although a unidirectional English \\"progressive\\" style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967, progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes. When the \\"progressive\\" label arrived, the music was dubbed \\"progressive pop\\" before it was called \\"progressive rock\\", with the term \\"progressive\\" referring to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formula. A number of additional factors contributed to the acquired \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic; technology was harnessed for new sounds; music approached the condition of \\"art\\"; some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th-century classical music; the album format overtook singles; and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. Critics of the genre often limit its scope to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music. Writer Emily Robinson says that the narrowed definition of \\"progressive rock\\" was a measure against the term's loose application in the late 1960s, when it was \\"applied to everyone from Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones\\". Debate over the genre's criterion continued to the 2010s, particularly on Internet forums dedicated to prog. According to musicologists Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, Bill Martin and Edward Macan authored major books about prog rock while \\"effectively accept[ing] the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics. ... they each do so largely unconsciously.\\" Academic John S. Cotner contests Macan's view that progressive rock cannot exist without the continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock. Author Kevin Holm-Hudson agrees that \\"progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics.\\" =Relation to art and social theories= In early references to the music, \\"progressive\\" was partly related to progressive politics, but those connotations were lost during the 1970s. On \\"progressive music\\", Holm-Hudson writes that it \\"moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between formalism and eclecticism\\". Cotner also says that progressive rock incorporates both formal and eclectic elements, \\"It consists of a combination of factors ‚Äì some of them intramusical (\\"within\\"), others extramusical or social (\\"without\\").\\" One way of conceptualising rock and roll in relation to \\"progressive music\\" is that progressive music pushed the genre into greater complexity while retracing the roots of romantic and classical music. Sociologist Paul Willis believes: \\"We must never be in doubt that 'progressive' music followed rock 'n' roll, and that it could not have been any other way. We can see rock 'n' roll as a deconstruction and 'progressive' music as a reconstruction.\\" Author Will Romano states that \\"rock itself can be interpreted as a progressive idea ... Ironically, and quite paradoxically, 'progressive rock', the classic era of the late 1960s through the mid- and late 1970s, introduces not only the explosive and exploratory sounds of technology ... but traditional music forms (classical and European folk) and (often) a pastiche compositional style and artificial constructs (concept albums) which suggests postmodernism.\\" History =1966‚Äì70: Origins= Background and roots The Beatles working in the studio with their producer George Martin, circa 1965 In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the \\"progressive\\" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: \\"we [the band] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing.\\" Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three- minute love song, leading to an intersection between the \\"underground\\" and the \\"establishment\\" for listening publics. Hegarty and Halliwell identify the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Doors, the Pretty Things, the Zombies, the Byrds, the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd \\"not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days\\". According to musicologist Walter Everett, the Beatles' \\"experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts\\" on their albums Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966) \\"encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s\\". Dylan's poetry, the Mothers of Invention's album Freak Out! (1966) and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) were all important in progressive rock's development. The productions of Phil Spector were key influences, as they introduced the possibility of using the recording studio to create music that otherwise could never be achieved. The same is said for the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966), which Brian Wilson intended as an answer to Rubber Soul and which in turn influenced the Beatles when they made Sgt. Pepper. Dylan introduced a literary element to rock through his fascination with the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also led the way in blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music. =Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper= Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper, with their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism, and influences derived from classical music forms, are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre and as turning points wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. Between Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper, the Beach Boys released the single \\"Good Vibrations\\" (1966), dubbed a \\"pocket symphony\\" by Derek Taylor, the band's publicist. The song contained an eclectic array of exotic instruments and several disjunctive key and modal shifts. Scott Interrante of Popmatters wrote that its influence on progressive rock and the psychedelic movement \\"can't be overstated\\". Martin likened the song to the Beatles' \\"A Day in the Life\\" from Sgt. Pepper, in that they showcase \\"the same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to\\". Although Sgt. Pepper was preceded by several albums that had begun to bridge the line between \\"disposable\\" pop and \\"serious\\" rock, it successfully gave an established \\"commercial\\" voice to an alternative youth culture and marked the point at which the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single. Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: \\"Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock.\\" In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between \\"pop\\" and \\"rock', thus eliminating the \\"roll\\" from \\"rock and roll\\" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained \\"rock\\" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from \\"radio friendly\\" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective \\"progressive\\" for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson. Proto-prog and psychedelia According to AllMusic: \\"Prog-rock began to emerge out of the British psychedelic scene in 1967, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues (Days of Future Passed).\\" The availability of newly affordable recording equipment coincided with the rise of a London underground scene at which the psychedelic drug LSD was commonly used. Pink Floyd and Soft Machine functioned as house bands at all-night events at locations such as Middle Earth and the UFO Club, where they experimented with sound textures and long-form songs. Many psychedelic, folk rock and early progressive bands were aided by exposure from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Jimi Hendrix, who rose to prominence in the London scene and recorded with a band of English musicians, initiated the trend towards guitar virtuosity and eccentricity in rock music. The Scottish band 1-2-3, later renamed Clouds, were formed in 1966 and began performing at London clubs a year later. According to Mojo George Knemeyer: \\"some claim [that they] had a vital influence on prog-rockers such as Yes, The Nice and Family.\\" Symphonic rock artists in the late 1960s had some chart success, including the singles \\"Nights in White Satin\\" (the Moody Blues, 1967) and \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" (Procol Harum, 1967). The Moody Blues established the popularity of symphonic rock when they recorded Days of Future Passed together with the London Festival Orchestra, and Procol Harum began to use a greater variety of acoustic instruments, particularly on their 1969 album A Salty Dog. Classical influences sometimes took the form of pieces adapted from or inspired by classical works, such as Jeff Beck's \\"Beck's Bolero\\" and parts of the Nice's Ars Longa Vita Brevis. The latter, along with such Nice tracks as \\"Rondo\\" and \\"America\\", reflect a greater interest in music that is entirely instrumental. Sgt. Pepper's and Days both represent a growing tendency towards song cycles and suites made up of multiple movements. Focus incorporated and articulated jazz-style chords, and irregular off-beat drumming into their later Rock based Riffs, and, several bands that included jazz-style horn sections appeared, including Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago. Of these, Martin highlights Chicago in particular for their experimentation with suites and extended compositions, such as the \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\" on Chicago II. Jazz influences appeared in the music of British bands such as Traffic, Colosseum and If, together with Canterbury scene bands such as Soft Machine and Caravan. Canterbury scene bands emphasised the use of wind instruments, complex chord changes and long improvisations. Martin writes that in 1968, \\"full-blown progressive rock\\" was not yet in existence, but three bands released albums who would later come to the forefront of the music: Jethro Tull, Caravan and Soft Machine. The term \\"progressive rock\\", which appeared in the liner notes of Caravan's 1968 self-titled debut LP, came to be applied to bands that used classical music techniques to expand the styles and concepts available to rock music. The Nice, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Pink Floyd all contained elements of what is now called progressive rock, but none represented as complete an example of the genre as several bands that formed soon after. Almost all of the genre's major bands, including Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, ELP, Gentle Giant and Renaissance, released their debut albums during the years 1968‚Äì1970. Most of these were folk-rock albums that gave little indication of what the band's mature sound would become, but King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King (1969) was a fully formed example of the genre. Critics assumed the album to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s work exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallising the music of earlier bands \\"into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style\\". =1970s‚Äì80s= Peak years (1971‚Äì76) Pink Floyd performing The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the best-selling album of the entire progressive rock period. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were one of the most commercially successful progressive rock bands of the 1970s. They are seen here performing in 1992. Most of the genre's major bands released their most critically acclaimed albums during the years 1971‚Äì1976. The genre experienced a high degree of commercial success during the early 1970s. Jethro Tull, ELP, Yes and Pink Floyd combined for four albums that reached number one in the US charts, and sixteen of their albums reached the top ten. Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973), an excerpt of which was used as the theme for the film The Exorcist, sold 16 million copies.DeRogatis, Jim. \\"The Curse of 'Tubular Bells'. 1974 also saw the rise of Supertramp, as the release of their third studio album saw some sucess in both UK and USA.\\" Chicago Sun-Times. Sun-Times News Group. 28 February 1993. HighBeam Research. Accessed 27 May 2013 Progressive rock came to be appreciated overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is at least in part due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs.Globe Staff. \\"Second Time's the Charm for Dregs.\\" The Boston Globe. 21 February 1992. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles. Progressive rock achieved popularity in Continental Europe more quickly than it did in the US. Italy remained generally uninterested in rock music until the strong Italian progressive rock scene developed in the early 1970s. Few of the European groups were successful outside of their own countries, with the exceptions of Dutch bands like Focus and Golden Earring who wrote English-language lyrics, and Le Orme and PFM, whose English lyrics were written by Peter Hammill and Peter Sinfield, respectively. Some European bands played in a style derivative of English bands. The \\"Kosmische music\\" scene in Germany came to be labelled as \\"krautrock\\" internationally and is variously seen as part of the progressive rock genre or an entirely distinct phenomenon. Bands such as Can, which included two members who had studied under Karlheinz Stockhausen, tended to be more strongly influenced by 20th-century classical music than the British bands, whose musical vocabulary leaned more towards the Romantic era. Many of these groups were very influential even among bands that had little enthusiasm for the symphonic variety of progressive rock. Decline and fragmentation Political and social trends of the late 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's development and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music was not part of the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches. King Crimson's Robert Fripp believed that the prog movement had gone \\"tragically off course\\". Four of progressive rock's most successful bands ‚Äì King Crimson, Yes, ELP and Genesis ‚Äì went on hiatus or experienced major personnel changes during the mid-1970s. Macan notes the September 1974 breakup of King Crimson as particularly significant, calling it the point when \\"all English bands in the genre should have ceased to exist\\". More of the major bands, including Van der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant and U.K., dissolved between 1978 and 1980. Many bands had by the mid-1970s reached the limit of how far they could experiment in a rock context, and fans had wearied of the extended, epic compositions. The sounds of the Hammond, Minimoog and Mellotron had been thoroughly explored, and their use became clich√©d. Those bands who continued to record often simplified their sound, and the genre fragmented from the late 1970s onwards. In Robert Fripp's opinion, once \\"progressive rock\\" ceased to cover new ground ‚Äì becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated ‚Äì the genre's premise had ceased to be \\"progressive\\". The era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount of control over the creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock. Few new progressive rock bands formed during this era, and those who did found that record labels were not interested in signing them.DeRogatis, Jim. \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Prog-Rock Underground (But Were Afraid to Ask).\\" 1998. Accessed 23 June 2013. The short-lived supergroup U.K. was a notable exception since its members had established reputations; they produced two albums that were stylistically similar to previous artists and did little to advance the genre. Part of the genre's legacy in this period was its influence on other styles, as several European guitarists brought a progressive rock approach to heavy metal and laid the groundwork for progressive metal.

Accessed 7 June 2013 =Commercialisation= Some established artists moved towards music that was simpler and more commercially viable. Arena rock bands like Journey, Kansas, Styx, GTR, ELO and Foreigner either had begun as progressive rock bands or included members with strong ties to the genre. These groups retained some of the song complexity and orchestral-style arrangements, but they moved away from lyrical mysticism in favour of more conventional themes such as relationships. Genesis transformed into a successful pop act, and a re-formed Yes released the relatively mainstream 90125 (1983), which yielded their only US number-one single, \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\". These radio-friendly groups have been called \\"prog lite\\". One band who remained successful into the 1980s while maintaining a progressive approach was Pink Floyd, who released The Wall late in 1979. The album, which brought punk anger into progressive rock, was a huge success and was later filmed as Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall. Post-punk and post-progressive Punk and prog were not necessarily as opposed as is commonly believed. Both genres reject commercialism, and punk bands did see a need for musical advancement. Author Doyle Green noted that post-punk emerged as \\"a kind of progressive punk\\". Post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined rock as \\"progressive\\", \\"art\\", or \\"studio perfectionism\\". In contrast to punk rock, it balances punk's energy and skepticism with art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. World music, especially African and Asian traditions, was also a major influence. Progressive rock's impact was felt in the work of some post-punk artists, although they tended not to emulate classical rock or Canterbury groups but rather Roxy Music, King Crimson, and krautrock bands, particularly Can. Talking Heads' Jerry Harrison (left) and David Byrne, late 1970s The term \\"post-progressive\\" identifies progressive rock that returns to its original principles while dissociating from 1970s prog styles, and may be located after 1978. Martin credits Roxy Music's Brian Eno as the sub-genre's most important catalyst, explaining that his 1973‚Äì77 output merged aspects of progressive rock with a prescient notion of new wave and punk. New wave, which surfaced around 1978‚Äì79 with some of the same attitudes and aesthetic as punk, was characterised by Martin as \\"progressive\\" multiplied by \\"punk\\". Bands in the genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than the punks, and there were crossovers, such as Fripp and Eno's involvement with Talking Heads, and Yes' replacement of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson with the pop duo the Buggles. When King Crimson reformed in 1981, they released an album, Discipline, which Macan says \\"inaugurated\\" the new post-progressive style. According to Martin, Talking Heads also created \\"a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well.\\" Neo- progressive rock A second wave of progressive rock bands appeared in the early 1980s and have since been categorised as a separate \\"neo-progressive rock\\" subgenre.Ewing, Jerry. \\"Pathways.\\" Classic Rock Presents Prog. 17 March 2010. p.61 These largely keyboard-based bands played extended compositions with complex musical and lyrical structures. Several of these bands were signed by major record labels, including Marillion, IQ, Pendragon and Pallas. Most of the genre's major acts released debut albums between 1983 and 1985 and shared the same manager, Keith Goodwin, a publicist who had been instrumental in promoting progressive rock during the 1970s. The previous decade's bands had the advantage of appearing during a prominent countercultural movement that provided them with a large potential audience, but the neo-progressive bands were limited to a relatively niche demographic and found it difficult to attract a following. Only Marillion and Saga experienced international success. Neo-progressive bands tended to use Peter Gabriel-era Genesis as their \\"principal model\\". They were also influenced by funk, hard rock and punk rock. The genre's most successful band, Marillion, suffered particularly from accusations of similarity to Genesis, although they used a different vocal style, incorporated more hard rock elements, and were very influenced by bands including Camel and Pink Floyd. Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell have pointed out that the neo-progressive bands were not so much plagiarising progressive rock as they were creating a new style from progressive rock elements, just as the bands of a decade before had created a new style from jazz and classical elements. Author Edward Macan counters by pointing out that these bands were at least partially motivated by a nostalgic desire to preserve a past style rather than a drive to innovate. =1990s‚Äì2000s= Third wave Porcupine Tree performs in 2007 A third wave of progressive rock bands, who can also be described as a second generation of neo- progressive bands, emerged in the 1990s. The use of the term \\"progressive\\" to describe groups that follow in the style of bands from ten to twenty years earlier is somewhat controversial, as it has been seen as a contradiction of the spirit of experimentation and progress. These new bands were aided in part by the availability of personal computer-based recording studios, which reduced album production expenses, and the Internet, which made it easier for bands outside of the mainstream to reach widespread audiences. Record stores specialising in progressive rock appeared in large cities. The shred music of the 1980s was a major influence on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of the vinyl LP. Progressive metal Progressive rock and heavy metal have similar timelines. Both emerged from late-1960s psychedelia to achieve great early-1970s success despite a lack of radio airplay and support from critics, then faded in the mid-to-late 1970s and experienced revivals in the early 1980s. Each genre experienced a fragmentation of styles at this time, and many metal bands from the new wave of British heavy metal onwards displayed progressive rock influences. Progressive metal reached a point of maturity with Queensr√øche's 1988 concept album Operation: Mindcrime and Voivod's 1989 Nothingface, which featured abstract lyrics and a King Crimson-like texture. Progressive rock elements appear in other metal subgenres. Black metal is conceptual by definition, due to its prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity. Its guttural vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as progressive, such as Mastodon, Mudvayne and Opeth. Symphonic metal is an extension of the tendency towards orchestral passages in early progressive rock. Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock,Allen, Jim. \\"From Tull To Tortoise: Post-Rock's Proggy Past\\". CMJ New Music. Accessed 20 June 2013.

Honorees, however, are not invited to perform at the awards ceremony, as the promoters want an event \\"that doesn't last three weeks\\". Festivals Many prominent progressive rock bands got their initial exposure at large rock festivals that were held in Britain during the late 1960s and early 1970s. King Crimson made their first major appearance at the 1969 Hyde Park free concert, before a crowd estimated to be as large as 650,000, in support of the Rolling Stones. Emerson, Lake & Palmer debuted at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, at which Supertramp, Family and Jethro Tull also appeared. Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 Newport Jazz Festival, the first year in which that festival invited rock bands to perform. Hawkwind appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage on the periphery of the event, and played for free. Supertramp performing in 1979 King Crimson performing at the Dour Festival, 2003 Renewed interest in the genre in the 1990s led to the development of progressive rock festivals. ProgFest, organised by Greg Walker and David Overstreet in 1993, was first held in UCLA's Royce Hall, and featured Sweden's √Ñnglag√•rd, the UK's IQ, Quill and Citadel. CalProg was held annually in Whittier, California during the 2000s. The North East Art Rock Festival, or NEARfest, held its first event in 1999 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and held annual sold-out concerts until 2012's NEARfest Apocalypse, which featured headliners UK and Renaissance. Other festivals include the annual ProgDay (the longest-running and only outdoor prog festival) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the annual Rites of Spring Festival (RoSfest) in Sarasota, Florida, The Rogue Independent Music Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, Baja Prog in Mexicali, Mexico, ProgPower USA in Atlanta, Georgia, ProgPower Europe in Baarlo, Netherlands, and ProgStock in Rahway, NJ, which held its first event in 2017.http://www.progstock.com Progressive Nation tours were held in 2008 and 2009 with Dream Theater as the headline act. \\"Night of the Prog\\" in St Goarshausen (Germany) is an established European progressive rock festival held every July during 2‚Äì3 days for 12 years. Reception The genre has received both critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of Igor Stravinsky and B√©la Bart√≥k. This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop, dismayed critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics, and shunning of rock's blues roots, were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music. Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive. Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex. The genre's greatest appeal is to white males. Most of the musicians involved were male, as was the case for most rock of the time, Female singers were better represented in progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members. British and European audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found American audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages. These aspirations towards high culture reflect progressive rock's origins as a music created largely by upper- and middle-class, white-collar, college-educated males from Southern England. The music never reflected the concerns of or was embraced by working- class listeners, except in the US, where listeners appreciated the musicians' virtuosity. Progressive rock's exotic, literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to British youth during the late 1970s, when the nation suffered from a poor economy and frequent strikes and shortages. Even King Crimson leader Robert Fripp dismissed progressive rock lyrics as \\"the philosophical meanderings of some English half-wit who is circumnavigating some inessential point of experience in his life\\". Bands whose darker lyrics avoided utopianism, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Van der Graaf Generator, experienced less critical disfavour. \\"I wasn't a big fan of most of what you'd call progressive rock\\", remarked Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. \\"I'm like Groucho Marx: I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member.\\" List of progressive rock bands See also * British folk rock * Free jazz * List of musical works in unusual time signatures * Minimal music * Musique concr√®te * Second Viennese School * Serialism * Third stream * Timeline of progressive rock * :Progressive rock record labels Notes References Sources     Bibliography                  * Further reading * Lucky, Jerry.

His research focused upon the languages of the Pacific Northwest. He was one of the first to call the fourth subfield of anthropology \\"linguistic anthropology\\" instead of \\"anthropological linguistics\\". The terminological shift draws attention to the field's grounding in anthropology rather than in what, by that time, had already become an autonomous discipline (linguistics). In 1972 Hymes founded the journal Language in Society and served as its editor for 22 years. He was accused of sexual harassment in the later years of his tenure at the University of Pennsylvania. Early life and education He was educated at Reed College, studying under David H. French; and, after a stint in prewar Korea, he graduated in 1950 . His work in the Army as a decoder is part of what influenced him to become a linguist. Hymes earned his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1955,A fellow folklore graduate student at Indiana was his former Reed classmate, the poet Gary Snyder and took a job at Harvard University. Even at that young age, Hymes had a reputation as a strong linguist; his dissertation, completed in one year, was a grammar of the Kathlamet language spoken near the mouth of the Columbia and known primarily from Franz Boas‚Äôs work at the end of the 19th century. Hymes remained at Harvard for five years, leaving in 1960 to join the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley. He spent five years at Berkeley as well, and then joined the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 (where he succeeded A. Irving Hallowell). In 1972 he joined the Department of Folklore and Folklife and became Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education in 1975. He served as president of the American Folklore Society in 1973-4, of the Linguistic Society of America in 1982, of the American Anthropological Association in 1983 - the last person to have held all three positions. He was a member of the Guild of Scholars of The Episcopal Church. While at Penn, Hymes was a founder of the journal Language in Society. In 2006, he was awarded the Gold Medal of Philology. Hymes later joined the Departments of Anthropology and English at the University of Virginia, where he became the Commonwealth Professor of Anthropology and English, and from which he retired in 2000, continuing as emeritus professor until his death from complications of Alzheimer's disease on November 13, 2009.Sally A. Downey, Dell Hathaway Hymes, 82, Penn education dean philly.com. Retrieved on November 19, 2009. His spouse, Virginia Hymes, was also a sociolinguist and folklorist. Influences on his work Hymes was influenced by a number of linguists, anthropologists and sociologists, notably Franz Boas, Edward Sapir and Harry Hoijer of the Americanist Tradition; Roman Jakobson and others of the Prague Linguistic Circle; sociologist Erving Goffman and anthropologist Ray L. Birdwhistell, both his colleagues at Penn, and ethnomethodologists Harold Garfinkel, Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. Hymes' career can be divided into at least two phases. In his early career Hymes adapted Prague School Functionalism to American Linguistic Anthropology, pioneering the study of the relationship between language and social context. Together with John Gumperz, Erving Goffman and William Labov, Hymes defined a broad multidisciplinary concern with language in society. Hymes' later work focuses on poetics, particularly the poetic organization of Native American oral narratives. He and Dennis Tedlock defined ethnopoetics as a field of study within linguistic anthropology and folkloristics. Hymes considers literary critic Kenneth Burke his biggest influence on this latter work, saying, \\"My sense of what I do probably owes more to KB than to anyone else\\".Hymes (2003), p. x. Hymes studied with Burke in the 1950s. Burke's work was theoretically and topically diverse, but the idea that seems most influential on Hymes is the application of rhetorical criticism to poetry. Hymes has included many other literary figures and critics among his influences, including Robert Alter, C. S. Lewis, A. L. Kroeber, Claude L√©vi- Strauss.Hymes (2003), pp. ix-x. Significance of his work As one of the first sociolinguists, Hymes helped to pioneer the connection between speech and social relations placing linguistic anthropology at the center of the performative turn within anthropology and the social sciences more generally. Hymes formulated a response to Noam Chomsky's influential distinction between competence (knowledge of grammatical rules necessary to decoding and producing language) and performance (actual language use in context). Hymes objected to the marginalization of performance from the center of linguistic inquiry and proposed the notion of communicative competence, or knowledge necessary to use language in social context, as an object of linguistic inquiry. Since appropriate language use is conventionally defined, and varies across different communities, much of Hymes early work frames a project for ethnographic investigation into contrasting patterns of language use across speech communities. Hymes termed this approach \\"the ethnography of speaking.\\" The SPEAKING acronym, described below, was presented as a lighthearted heuristic to aid fieldworkers in their attempt to document and analyze instances of language in use, which he termed \\"speech events.\\" Embedded in the acronym is an application and extension of Jakobson's arguments concerning the multifunctionality of language. He articulated other, more technical, often typologically oriented approaches to variation in patterns of language use across speech communities in a series of articles.Hymes, D. (1972). Models of the interaction of language and social life. In J. Gumperz & D. Hymes (Eds.), Directions in sociolinguistics: The ethnography of communication (pp. 35‚Äì71). New York: Holt, Rhinehart & Winston.Hymes, D. (1964). Two types of linguistic relativity: Some examples from American Indian ethnography. Sociolinguistics. WilliamBright, ed, 114‚Äì167. As a result of discussions primarily with Ray Birdwhistell at the University of Pennsylvania, in his later work, Hymes renamed the \\"ethnography of speaking\\" the \\"ethnography of communication\\" to reflect the broadening of focus from instances of language production to the ways in which communication (including oral, written, broadcast, acts of receiving/listening) is conventionalized in a given community of users, and to include nonverbal as well as verbal behavior.Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1984). On the relationship of the 'ethnography of speaking' to the 'ethnography of communication.' Papers in Linguistics: International Journal of Human Communication, 17(1), 7‚Äì32.Leeds-Hurwitz, W., & Sigman, S. J. (2010). The Penn tradition. In W. Leeds-Hurwitz (Ed.), The social history of language and social interaction research: People, places, ideas. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, p. 236. With Erving Goffman and John Szwed, he established the Center for Urban Ethnography in 1969. The goal was to fund research by both faculty and students at Penn that used urban ethnography as the primary method, and much innovative research resulted. The first major grant came from the National Institute of Mental Health, funding much research emphasizing different racial and ethnic groups; the second from the U.S. National Institute of Education, funding classroom ethnography.Leeds-Hurwitz, W., & Sigman, S. J. (2010). The Penn tradition. In W. Leeds-Hurwitz (Ed.), The social history of language and social interaction research: People, places, ideas. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, p. 254-6. With Erving Goffman he co- edited the series Conduct and Communication for the University of Pennsylvania Press as a way to support research they considered most valuable.Leeds- Hurwitz, W., & Sigman, S. J. (2010). The Penn tradition. In W. Leeds-Hurwitz (Ed.), The social history of language and social interaction research: People, places, ideas. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, p. 256-8. Hymes promoted what he and others call \\"ethnopoetics\\", an anthropological method of transcribing and analyzing folklore and oral narrative that pays attention to poetic structures within speech. In reading the transcriptions of Indian myths, for example, which were generally recorded as prose by the anthropologists who came before, Hymes noticed that there are commonly poetic structures in the wording and structuring of the tale.He also had to master the grammars of several Native American languages in the process, and was probably the last person who could recite texts in Clackamas Chinook, an extinct language. Patterns of words and word use follow patterned, artistic forms. Hymes' goal, in his own mind, is to understand the artistry and \\"the competence... that underlies and informs such narratives\\" (Hymes 2003:vii). He created the Dell Hymes Model of Speaking and coined the term communicative competence within language education. In addition to being entertaining stories or important myths about the nature of the world, narratives also convey the importance of aboriginal environmental management knowledge such as fish spawning cycles in local rivers or the disappearance of grizzly bears from Oregon. Hymes believes that all narratives in the world are organized around implicit principles of form which convey important knowledge and ways of thinking and of viewing the world. He argues that understanding narratives will lead to a fuller understanding of the language itself and those fields informed by storytelling, in which he includes ethnopoetics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, rhetoric, semiotics, pragmatics, narrative inquiry and literary criticism. Hymes clearly considers folklore and narrative a vital part of the fields of linguistics, anthropology and literature, and has bemoaned the fact that so few scholars in those fields are willing and able to adequately include folklore in its original language in their considerations (Hymes 1981:6‚Äì7). He feels that the translated versions of the stories are inadequate for understanding their role in the social or mental system in which they existed. He provides an example that in Navajo, the particles (utterances such as \\"uh,\\" \\"So,\\" \\"Well,\\" etc. that have linguistic if not semantic meaning), omitted in the English translation, are essential to understanding how the story is shaped and how repetition defines the structure that the text embodies. Hymes was the founding editor for the journal Language in Society, which he edited for 22 years.Dell Hymes. 1997. Language in Society. In The Early Days of Sociolinguistics: Memories and Reflections, ed. by Christina Bratt Paulston and G. Richard Tucker, pp. 243‚Äì245. Dallas: SIL International. The \\"S-P-E-A- K-I-N-G\\" model Hymes developed a valuable model to assist the identification and labeling of components of linguistic interaction that was driven by his view that, in order to speak a language correctly, one needs not only to learn its vocabulary and grammar, but also the context in which words are used. The model had sixteen components that can be applied to many sorts of discourse: message form; message content; setting; scene; speaker/sender; addressor; hearer/receiver/audience; addressee; purposes (outcomes); purposes (goals); key; channels; forms of speech; norms of interaction; norms of interpretation; and genres.Hymes, D. (1974). Foundations in Sociolinguistics: An Ethnographic Approach. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 53‚Äì62. Hymes constructed the acronym SPEAKING, under which he grouped the sixteen components within eight divisions:Note that the categories are simply listed in the order demanded by the mnemonic, not by importance =Setting and scene= \\"Setting refers to the time and place of a speech act and, in general, to the physical circumstances\\" - Hymes (1974), p. 55. The living room in the grandparents' home might be a setting for a family story. Scene is the \\"psychological setting\\" or \\"cultural definition\\" of a setting, including characteristics such as range of formality and sense of play or seriousness.Hymes (1974), pp. 55‚Äì56. The family story may be told at a reunion celebrating the grandparents' anniversary. At times, the family would be festive and playful; at other times, serious and commemorative. =Participants= Speaker and audience - Linguists will make distinctions within these categories; for example, the audience can be distinguished as addressees and other hearers.Hymes (1974), pp. 54 and 56. At the family reunion, an aunt might tell a story to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative. =Ends= Purposes, goals, and outcomes - Hymes (1974), pp. 56‚Äì57. The aunt may tell a story about the grandmother to entertain the audience, teach the young women, and honor the grandmother. =Act sequence= Form and order of the event - The aunt's story might begin as a response to a toast to the grandmother. The story's plot and development would have a sequence structured by the aunt. Possibly there would be a collaborative interruption during the telling. Finally, the group might applaud the tale and move onto another subject or activity. =Key= Clues that establish the \\"tone, manner, or spirit\\" of the speech act - Hymes (1974), p. 57. The aunt might imitate the grandmother's voice and gestures in a playful way, or she might address the group in a serious voice emphasizing the sincerity and respect of the praise the story expresses. =Instrumentalities= Forms and styles of speech - Hymes (1974), pp. 58‚Äì60. The aunt might speak in a casual register with many dialect features or might use a more formal register and careful grammatically \\"standard\\" forms. =Norms= Social rules governing the event and the participants' actions and reaction - In a playful story by the aunt, the norms might allow many audience interruptions and collaboration, or possibly those interruptions might be limited to participation by older females. A serious, formal story by the aunt might call for attention to her and no interruptions as norms. =Genre= The kind of speech act or event; for the example used here, the kind of story - The aunt might tell a character anecdote about the grandmother for entertainment, or an exemplum as moral instruction. Different disciplines develop terms for kinds of speech acts, and speech communities sometimes have their own terms for types.Anticipating that he might be accused of creating an (English language) \\"ethnocentric\\" mnemonic ‚Äî and, thus, by implication, an (English language) \\"ethnocentric\\" theory ‚Äî Hymes comments that he could have, for instance, generated a French language mnemonic of P-A-R-L-A-N-T: namely, participants, actes, raison (resultat), locale, agents (instrumentalities), normes, ton (key), types (genres) (1974, p. 62).

Prince is also a title of nobility (often highest), often hereditary, in some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun princeps, from primus (first) and capio (to seize), meaning \\"the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble ruler, prince\\".Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant & Charles, 260th thousand Historical background Cicero attacks Catiline in the Senate of the Roman Republic. The Latin word prƒ´nceps (older Latin *prƒ´smo-kaps, literally \\"the one who takes the first [place/position]\\"), became the usual title of the informal leader of the Roman senate some centuries before the transition to empire, the princeps senatus. Emperor Augustus established the formal position of monarch on the basis of principate, not dominion. He also tasked his grandsons as summer rulers of the city when most of the government were on holiday in the country or attending religious rituals, and, for that task, granted them the title of princeps. The title has generic and substantive meanings: * generically, prince refers to a member of a family that ruled by hereditary right such as the House of Sverre in Norway or to the non-reigning descendants , the title referring either to sovereigns, former sovereigns descendants such as the House of Rosensverd National Library of Norway \\"Rosensverd-slektens forfedre\\" Billingstad & Billingstad, 1990, Oslo, Norway as descendants of king Haakon V or to cadets of a sovereign's family. The term may be broadly used of persons in various cultures, continents or eras. In Europe, it is the title legally borne by dynastic cadets in monarchies, and borne by courtesy by members of formerly reigning dynasties. * as a substantive title, a prince was a monarch of the lowest rank in post- Napoleonic Europe, e.g. Princes of, respectively, Andorra, Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen, Mingrelia, Monaco, Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wallachia, etc. * also substantively, the title was granted by popes and secular monarchs to specific individuals and to the heads of some high-ranking European families who, however, never exercised dynastic sovereignty and whose cadets are not entitled to share the princely title, viz the Princes de Beauvau-Craon, von Bismarck, Colonna, von Dohna-Schlobitten, von Eulenburg, de Faucigny-Lucinge, von Lichnowsky, von Pless, Ruffo di Calabria, (de Talleyrand) von Sagan, van Ursel, etc. * generically, cadets of some non-sovereign families whose head bears the non-dynastic title of prince (or, less commonly, duke) were sometimes also authorized to use the princely title, e.g. von Carolath- Beuthen, de Broglie, Demidoff di San Donato, Lieven, de Merode, Pignatelli, Radziwill, von Wrede, Yussopov, etc. * substantively, the heirs apparent in some monarchies use a specific princely title associated with a territory within the monarch's realm, e.g. the Princes of, respectively, Asturias (Spain), Gr√£o Par√° (Brazil, formerly), Orange (Netherlands), Viana (Navarre, formerly), Wales (UK), etc. * substantively, it became the fashion from the 17th century for the heirs apparent of the leading ducal families to assume a princely title, associated with a seigneurie in the family's possession. These titles were borne by courtesy and preserved by tradition, not law, e.g. the princes de, respectively, Bidache (Gramont), Marcillac (La Rochefoucauld), Tonnay-Charente (Mortemart), Poix (Noailles), L√©on (Rohan-Chabot), Prince as generic for ruler The original, but now less common use of the word, originated in the application of the Latin word princeps, from late Roman law, and the classical system of government that eventually gave way to the European feudal society. In this sense, a prince is a ruler of a territory which is sovereign, or quasi-sovereign, i.e., exercising substantial (though not all) prerogatives associated with monarchs of independent nations, such as the immediate states within the historical boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. In medieval and Early Modern Europe, there were as many as two hundred such territories, especially in Italy, Germany, and Gaelic Ireland. In this sense, \\"prince\\" is used of any and all rulers, regardless of actual title or precise rank. This is the Renaissance use of the term found in Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's famous work, Il Principe.\\"F√ºrst - Origins and cognates of the title\\", 2006, webpage: EFest-Frst . It is also used in this sense in the United States Declaration of Independence. As a title, by the end of the medieval era, prince was borne by rulers of territories that were either substantially smaller than or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings. A lord of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a prince before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin princeps (as for the hereditary ruler of Wales), or when the lord's territory was allodial. The lord of an allodium owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a liege lord, nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction. Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e.g. the Princedom of Dombes. Lords who exercised lawful authority over territories and people within a feudal hierarchy were also sometimes regarded as princes in the general sense, especially if they held the rank of count or higher. This is attested in some surviving styles for e.g., British earls, marquesses, and dukes are still addressed by the Crown on ceremonial occasions as high and noble princes (cf. Royal and noble styles). In parts of the Holy Roman Empire in which primogeniture did not prevail (e.g., Germany), all legitimate agnates had an equal right to the family's hereditary titles. While this meant that offices, such as emperor, king, and elector could only be legally occupied by one dynast at a time, holders of such other titles as duke, margrave, landgrave, count palatine, and prince could only differentiate themselves by adding the name of their appanage to the family's original title. Not only did this tend to proliferate unwieldy titles (e.g. Princess Katherine of Anhalt- Zerbst, or Karl, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Neukastell-Kleeburg, or Prince Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n-Norburg), but as agnatic primogeniture gradually became the norm in the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the 18th century, another means of distinguishing the monarch from other members of his dynasty became necessary. Gradual substitution of the title of Prinz for the monarch's title of F√ºrst occurred, and became customary for cadets in all German dynasties except in the grand duchies of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg.Almanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 14‚Äì131. Both Prinz and F√ºrst are translated into English as \\"prince\\", but they reflect not only different but mutually exclusive concepts. This distinction had evolved before the 18th century (Liechtenstein long remained an exception, cadets and females using F√ºrst/F√ºrstin into the 19th century) for dynasties headed by a F√ºrst in Germany. The custom spread through the Continent to such an extent that a renowned imperial general who belonged to a cadet branch of a reigning ducal family, remains best known to history by the generic dynastic title, \\"Prince Eugene of Savoy\\". Note that the princely title was used as a prefix to his Christian name, which also became customary. Cadets of France's other princes √©trangers affected similar usage under the Bourbon kings. Always facing the scepticism of Saint-Simon and like-minded courtiers, these quasi- royal aristocrats' assumption of the princely title as a personal, rather than territorial, designation encountered some resistance. In writing Histoire Genealogique et Chonologique, P√®re Anselme accepts that, by the end of the 17th century, the heir apparent to the House of La Tour d'Auvergne's sovereign duchy bears the title, prince de Bouillon, but he would record in 1728 that the heir's La Tour cousin, the Count of Oliergues, is \\"known as the Prince Frederick\\" (\\"dit le prince Fr√©d√©ric\\"). The post-medieval rank of gef√ºrsteter Graf (princely count) embraced but elevated the German equivalent of the intermediate French, English and Spanish nobles. In the Holy Roman Empire, these nobles rose to dynastic status by preserving from the Imperial crown (de jure after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648) the exercise of such sovereign prerogatives as the minting of money; the muster of military troops and the right to wage war and contract treaties; local judicial authority and constabular enforcement; and the habit of inter-marrying with sovereign dynasties. By the 19th century, cadets of a F√ºrst would become known as Prinzen. Prince of the blood Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©, was the premier prince du sang during his lifetime (painted by Joost van Egmont). The husband of a queen regnant is usually titled \\"prince consort\\" or simply \\"prince\\", whereas the wives of male monarchs take the female equivalent (e.g., empress, queen) of their husband's title. In Brazil, Portugal and Spain, however, the husband of a female monarch was accorded the masculine equivalent of her title (e.g., emperor, king), at least after he fathered her heir. In previous epochs, husbands of queens regnant were often deemed entitled to the crown matrimonial, sharing their consorts' regnal title and rank jure uxoris, However, in cultures which allow the ruler to have several wives (e.g., four in Islam) or official concubines (e.g., Imperial China, Ottoman Empire, Thailand, KwaZulu-Natal) these women, sometimes collectively referred to as a harem, there are often specific rules determining their relative hierarchy and a variety of titles, which may distinguish between those whose offspring can be in line for the succession or not, or specifically who is mother to the heir to the throne. To complicate matters, the style His/Her (Imperial/Royal) Highness, a prefix often accompanying the title of a dynastic prince, may be awarded/withheld separately (as a compromise or consolation prize, in some sense, e.g., Duke of C√°diz, Duchess of Windsor, Princesse de R√©thy, Prince d'Orl√©ans-Braganza). Although the arrangement set out above is the one that is most commonly understood, there are also different systems. Depending on country, epoch, and translation, other usages of \\"prince\\" are possible. Foreign-language titles such as Italian principe, French prince, German F√ºrst and Prinz (non-reigning descendants of a reigning monarch),Duden; Definition of the German title F√ºrst (in German). Duden; Definition of the German title Prinz (in German). Russian knyaz, etc., are usually translated as \\"prince\\" in English. Some princely titles are derived from those of national rulers, such as tsarevich from tsar. Other examples are (e)mirza(da), khanzada, nawabzada, sahibzada, shahzada, sultanzada (all using the Persian patronymic suffix -zada, meaning \\"son, descendant\\"). However, some princely titles develop in unusual ways, such as adoption of a style for dynasts which is not pegged to the ruler's title, but rather continues an old tradition (e.g., \\"grand duke\\" in Romanov Russia or \\"archduke\\" in Habsburg Austria), claims dynastic succession to a lost monarchy (e.g. prince de Tarente for the La Tr√©mo√Ølle heirs to the Neapolitan throne), or descends from a ruler whose princely title or sovereign status was not, de jure, hereditary, but attributed to descendants as an international courtesy, (e.g., Bibesco, Poniatowski, Ypsilanti). =Specific titles= Jos√©, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza, died before he could ascend to the throne of Portugal. In some dynasties, a specific style other than prince has become customary for dynasts, such as fils de France in the House of Capet, and Infante. Infante was borne by children of the monarch other than the heir apparent in all of the Iberian monarchies. Some monarchies used a specific princely title for their heirs, such as Prince of Asturias in Spain and Prince of Brazil in Portugal. Sometimes a specific title is commonly used by various dynasties in a region, e.g. Mian in various of the Punjabi princely Hill States (lower Himalayan region in British India). European dynasties usually awarded appanages to princes of the blood, typically attached to a feudal noble title, such as Prince of Orange in the Netherlands, Britain's royal dukes, the Dauphin in France, the Count of Flanders in Belgium, and the Count of Syracuse in Sicily. Sometimes appanage titles were princely, e.g. Prince of Achaia (Courtenay), prince de Cond√© (Bourbon), Prince of Carignan (Savoy), but it was the fact that their owners were of princely rank rather than that they held a princely title which was the source of their pre-eminence. For the often specific terminology concerning an heir apparent, see Crown prince. Prince as a substantive title Other princes derive their title not from dynastic membership as such, but from inheritance of a title named for a specific and historical territory. The family's possession of prerogatives or properties in that territory might be long past. Such were most of the \\"princedoms\\" of France's ancien r√©gime, so resented for their pretentiousness in the memoirs of Saint-Simon. These included the princedoms of Arches-Charleville, Boisbelle-Henrichemont, Chalais, Ch√¢teau-Regnault, Gu√©m√©n√©e, Martigues, Merc≈ìur, Sedan, Talmond, Tingrey, and the \\"kingship\\" of Yvetot, among others. =Prince as a reigning monarch= A prince or princess who is the head of state of a territory that has a monarchy as a form of government is a reigning prince. Extant principalities The current princely monarchies include: * The co-principality of Andorra (current reigning princes are the French President Emmanuel Macron and HE Joan Enric Vives Sic√≠lia) * The emirate of Kuwait (current reigning emir is Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah) * The principality of Liechtenstein (current reigning prince is Hans-Adam II) * The principality of Monaco (current reigning prince is Albert II) * The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (current reigning prince is Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto) * The emirate of Qatar (current reigning emir is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani) * The member emirates of the federation in the United Arab Emirates (United Arab Principalities):  Abu Dhabi (Emir Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also President of the UAE)  Ajman (Emir Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi)  Dubai (Emir Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE)  Fujairah (Emir Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi)  Ras al-Khaimah (Emir Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi)  Sharjah (Emir Sultan III bin Muhammad al-Qasimi)  Umm al-Quwain (Emir Saud bin Rashid Al Mu'alla) File:Coat of arms of Andorra.svgCoat of arms of the principality of Andorra (1607). File:Staatswappen-Liechtensteins.svgCoat of arms of the principality of Liechtenstein (1719). \\"Micronations\\" In the same tradition, some self-proclaimed monarchs of so-called \\"micronations\\" style themselves as princes: * Roy Bates called himself \\"Prince Roy\\" of the Principality of Sealand * Leonard George Casley called himself \\"Prince Leonard I\\" of the Principality of Hutt River (enclave in Australia) Prince exercising head of state's authority Various monarchies provide for different modes in which princes of the dynasty can temporarily or permanently share in the style and / or office of the monarch, e.g. as regent or viceroy. Though these offices may not be reserved legally for members of the ruling dynasty, in some traditions they are filled by dynasts, a fact which may be reflected in the style of the office, e.g. \\"prince-president\\" for Napoleon III as French head of state but not yet emperor, or \\"prince-lieutenant\\" in Luxembourg, repeatedly filled by the crown prince before the grand duke's abdication, or in form of consortium imperii. Some monarchies even have a practice in which the monarch can formally abdicate in favor of his heir, and yet retain a kingly title with executive power, e.g. Maha Upayuvaraja (Sanskrit for Great Joint King in Cambodia), though sometimes also conferred on powerful regents who exercised executive powers. =Non-dynastic princes= Otto, prince of Bismarck (German Empire). In several countries of the European continent, such as France, prince can be an aristocratic title of someone having a high rank of nobility or as lord of a significant fief, but not ruling any actual territory and without any necessary link to the royal family, which makes it difficult to compare with the British system of royal princes. France and the Holy Roman Empire The kings of France started to bestow the style of prince, as a title among the nobility, from the 16th century onwards. These titles were created by elevating a seigneurie to the nominal status of a principality‚Äîalthough prerogatives of sovereignty were never conceded in the letters patent. Princely titles self-assumed by the princes du sang and by the princes √©trangers were generally tolerated by the king and used at the royal court, outside the Parlement of Paris. These titles held no official place in the hierarchy of the nobility, but were often treated as ranking just below ducal peerages, since they were often inherited (or assumed) by ducal heirs: * French titles of prince recognized by the king  Holy Roman Empire states annexed by France * Arches-Charleville: in the Ardennes region, near the border with the Empire. * Ch√¢teau-Renaud: near Arches-Charleville. * Dombes: on the east bank of the Rh√¥ne. * Orange. * Sedan: held by the Dukes of Bouillon.

This can even occur in a monarchy within which an identical but real and substantive feudal title exists, such as F√ºrst in German. An example of this is: * Otto von Bismarck was created Prince von Bismarck in the empire of reunited Germany, under the Hohenzollern dynasty. Spain, France and Netherlands princes of Waterloo (the Netherlands). In other cases, such titular princedoms are created in chief of an event, such as a treaty or a victory. Examples include: * The Spanish minister Manuel Godoy was created Principe de la Paz (\\"Prince of Peace\\") by his king for negotiating the 1795 double peace-treaty of Basilea, by which the revolutionary French republic made peace with Prussia and with Spain. * The triumphant generals who led their troops to victory often received a victory title from Napoleon, both princely and ducal * King William I of the Netherlands bestowed the victory title of Prince of Waterloo upon Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington after his defeat of Napoleon I Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1815, Joseph Bonaparte conferred the title \\"Prince of Spain\\" to be hereditary on his children and grandchildren in the male and female line. Eastern Europe Sanguszko- Lubartowicz (Poland). In the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the titles of prince dated either to the times before the Union of Lublin or were granted to Polish nobles by foreign monarchs, as the law in Poland forbade the king from dividing nobility by granting them hereditary titles: see The Princely Houses of Poland. Youssoupoff In the Russian system, knyaz, translated as \\"prince\\", is the highest degree of official nobility. Members of older dynasties, whose realms were eventually annexed to the Russian Empire, were also accorded the title of knyaz ‚Äî sometimes after first being allowed to use the higher title of tsarevich (e.g. the Princes Gruzinsky and Sibirsky). The many surviving branches of the Rurik dynasty used the knyaz title before and after they yielded sovereignty to their kinsmen, the Grand Princes of Muscovy, who became Tsars and, under the House of Romanov, Emperors of Russia. Title in various Western traditions and languages In each case, the title is followed (when available) by the female form and then (not always available, and obviously rarely applicable to a prince of the blood without a principality) the name of the territory associated with it, each separated by a slash. If a second title (or set) is also given, then that one is for a Prince of the blood, the first for a principality. Be aware that the absence of a separate title for a prince of the blood may not always mean no such title exists; alternatively, the existence of a word does not imply there is also a reality in the linguistic territory concerned; it may very well be used exclusively to render titles in other languages, regardless whether there is a historical link with any (which often means that linguistic tradition is adopted) Etymologically, we can discern the following traditions (some languages followed a historical link, e.g. within the Holy Roman Empire, not their language family; some even fail to follow the same logic for certain other aristocratic titles): =Romance languages= *Languages (mostly Romance) only using the Latin root princeps: Catalan: Pr√≠ncep /Princesa ‚Äì Pr√≠ncep /Princesa French: Prince /Princesse ‚Äì Prince /Princesse Friulian: Princip /Principesse ‚Äì Princip /Principesse Italian: Principe /Principessa ‚Äì Principe /Principessa Latin (post-Roman): Princeps/*Princeps/*Monegasque: Principu /Principessa ‚Äì Principu /Principessa Occitan: Prince /Princessa ‚Äì Prince /Princessa Portuguese: Pr√≠ncipe /Princesa ‚Äì Pr√≠ncipe /Princesa Rhaeto-Romansh: Prinzi /Prinzessa ‚Äì Prinzi /Prinzessa Romanian: Prin≈£ /Prin≈£esƒÉ ‚Äì Principe /PrincipesƒÉ Spanish: Pr√≠ncipe /Princesa ‚Äì Pr√≠ncipe /Princesa Venetian: Principe /Principessa ‚Äì Principe /Principessa =Celtic languages= *Celtic languages: Breton: Pri√±s/Pri√±sez Irish: Prionsa/Banphrionsa ‚Äì Flaith/Banfhlaith Scottish Gaelic: Prionnsa/Bana- phrionnsa ‚Äì Flath/Ban-fhlath Welsh: Tywysog/Tywysoges ‚Äì Prins/Prinses =Germanic languages= * Languages (mainly Germanic) that use (generally alongside a princeps-derivate for princes of the blood) an equivalent of the German F√ºrst: Anglo-Teutonic: King\`s Thane English: Prince /Princess ‚Äì Prince /Princess Afrikaans: Prins Danish: Fyrste /Fyrstinde ‚Äì Prins /Prinsesse Dutch: Vorst /Vorstin- Prins /Prinses Faroese: F√∫rsti /F√∫rstafr√∫a, F√∫rstinna ‚Äì Prinsur /Prinsessa West Frisian: Foarst /Foarstinne ‚Äì Prins /Prinsesse German: F√ºrst /F√ºrstin ‚Äì Prinz /Prinzessin Icelandic: Fursti /Furstynja ‚Äì Prins /Prinsessa Luxembourgish: F√ºrst /F√ºrstin ‚Äì Pr√´nz /Prinzessin Norwegian: Fyrste /Fyrstinne ‚Äì Prins /Prinsesse Old-Norwegian - Konningers Thienner (Prince) Old English: «¢√∞eling /Hl√¶fdiƒ°e Swedish: Furste /Furstinna ‚Äì Prins /Prinsessa =Slavic languages= * Slavic: Belarusian: Tsarevich, Karalevich, Prynts /Tsarewna, Karalewna, Pryntsesa Bosnian: –ö–Ω–µ–∑/–ö–Ω–µ–≥–∏—ö–∞ or Knez/Kneginja, –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–∏—õ/–ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–Ω–∞ or Kraljeviƒá/Kraljevna, –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü/–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–µ–∑–∞ or Princ/Princeza Bulgarian (phonetically spelt): Knyaz/Knyaginya, Prints/Printsesa Croatian: Knez/Kneginja, Kraljeviƒá/Kraljevna, Princ/Princeza Czech: Kn√≠≈æe /Knƒõ≈æna, Princ, Kralevic/Princezna Macedonian: Knez /Knegina, Princ /Princeza Polish: KsiƒÖ≈ºƒô/Ksiƒô≈ºna, Kr√≥lewicz/Kr√≥lewna Russian: –ö–Ω—è–∑—å/–ö–Ω—è–≥–∏–Ω—è or Knyaz /Knyagina, Knyazhna, Tsarevich, Korolyevich, Prints /Tsarevna, Korolyevna, Printsessa Serbian: –ö–Ω–µ–∑/–ö–Ω–µ–≥–∏—ö–∞ or Knez/Kneginja, –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–∏—õ/–ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–Ω–∞ or Kraljeviƒá/Kraljevna, –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü/–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–µ–∑–∞ or Princ/Princeza Slovak: Knie≈æa /K≈àa≈æn√°, Kr√°ƒæoviƒç, Princ /Princezn√° Slovene: Knez /Kneginja, Princ /Princesa Kraljeviƒç/Kraljiƒçna Ukrainian: Knyaz /Knyazhnya, Tsarenko, Korolenko, Prints /Tsarivna, Korolivna, Printsizna =Other Western languages= *Albanian: Princ /Princesh√´ ‚Äì Princ /Princesh√´ *Estonian: V√ºrst /V√ºrstinna ‚Äì Prints /Printsess *Finnish: Ruhtinas /Ruhtinatar ‚Äì Prinssi /Prinsessa *Georgian: ·Éó·Éê·Éï·Éê·Éì·Éò / Tavadi, ·É£·É§·Éö·Éò·É°·É¨·É£·Éö·Éò/ \\"Uplists'uli\\" (\\"Child of the Lord\\") *Greek (Medieval, formal): Prigkips, Œ†œÅŒØŒ≥Œ∫Œ∑œà/Prigkipissa, Œ†œÅŒπŒ≥Œ∫ŒÆœÄŒπœÉœÉŒ± *Greek (Modern, colloquial): Prigkipas, Œ†œÅŒØŒ≥Œ∫Œ∑œÄŒ±œÇ/Prigkipissa, Œ†œÅŒπŒ≥Œ∫ŒÆœÄŒπœÉœÉŒ± *Hungarian (Magyar): Herceg / Hercegn≈ë, or Fejedelem / Fejedelemn≈ë if head of state *Latvian: Firsts /Firstiene ‚Äì Princis /Princese *Lithuanian: Kunigaik≈°tis /Kunigaik≈°tienƒó ‚Äì Princas /Princese *Maltese: Prinƒãep /Prinƒãipessa ‚Äì Prinƒãep /Prinƒãipessa *Persian : Shahzade (both genders), Shahpour (King's son in general) *Turkish: Prens / Prenses - ≈ûehzade Title in other traditions and languages Georgian prince, Tavadi. In Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Hungary the title of prince has also been used as the highest title of nobility (without membership in a ruling dynasty), above the title of duke, while the same usage (then as F√ºrst) has occurred in Germany and Austria but then one rank below the title of duke and above count.Bonniers konversationslexikon I 1937 pp. 82-86 The above is essentially the story of European, Christian dynasties and other nobility, also 'exported' to their colonial and other overseas territories and otherwise adopted by rather westernized societies elsewhere (e.g. Haiti). Applying these essentially western concepts, and terminology, to other cultures even when they don't do so, is common but in many respects rather dubious. Different (historical, religious...) backgrounds have also begot significantly different dynastic and nobiliary systems, which are poorly represented by the 'closest' western analogy. It therefore makes sense to treat these per civilization. =Islamic traditions= *Arabian tradition since the caliphate ‚Äì in several monarchies it remains customary to use the title Sheikh (in itself below princely rank) for all members of the royal family. In families (often reigning dynasties) which claim descent from Muhammad, this is expressed in either of a number of titles (supposing different exact relations): sayid, sharif; these are retained even when too remote from any line of succession to be a member of any dynasty. *In Saudi Arabia the title of Emir is used in role of prince for all members of the House of Saud. *In Iraq, the direct descendants of previous Emirs from the largest tribes, who ruled the kingdoms before modern statehood, use the title of Sheikh or Prince as the progeny of royalty. *In the Ottoman Empire, the sovereign of imperial rank (incorrectly known in the west as (Great) sultan) was styled padishah with a host of additional titles, reflecting his claim as political successor to the various conquered states. Princes of the blood, male, were given the style ≈ûehzade. *Persia (Iran) ‚Äì Princes as members of a royal family, are referred to by the title Shahzadeh, meaning \\"descendant of the king\\". Since the word zadeh could refer to either a male or female descendant, Shahzadeh had the parallel meaning of \\"princess\\" as well. Princes can also be sons of provincial kings (Khan) and the title referring to them would be the title of Khanzadeh. Princes as people who got a title from the King are called \\"Mirza\\", diminutive of \\"Amir Zadeh\\" (King's Son). *In Indian Muslim dynasties, the most common titles were Mirza (from Amirzada) and Shahzada; while Nawabzada and Sahibzada were also given to younger blood princes. *In Kazakh Khanate the title Sultan was used for lords from a ruling dynasty (direct descendants of Genghis Khan), that gives them a right to be elected as khan, as an experienced ruler; and an honorific tore (:ru:–¢–æ—Ä–µ (—Ä–æ–¥)) for ordinary members of a ruling dynasty. =Non-Islamic Asian traditions= China In ancient China, the title of prince developed from being the highest title of nobility (synonymous with duke) in the Zhou Dynasty, to five grades of princes (not counting the sons and grandsons of the emperor) by the time of the fall of the Qing Dynasty.The Chinese word for prince Wang (, literally, King) as Chinese believe the emperor Huang Di () is the ruler of all kings. The most accurate translations of the English word \\"prince\\" are Huang Zi (, lit. Son of the Emperor) or Wang Zi (, lit. Son of the King). Japan In Japan, the title K≈çshaku () was used as the highest title of Kazoku ( Japanese modern nobility) before the present constitution. K≈çshaku, however, is more commonly translated as \\"Duke\\" to avoid confusion with the following royal ranks in the Imperial Household: Shinn≈ç ( literally, Prince of the Blood); Naishinn≈ç ( lit., Princess of the Blood in her own right); and Shinn≈çhi lit., Princess Consort); or ≈å ( lit., Prince); Jyo-≈å ( lit., Princess (in her own right)); and ≈åhi ( lit., Princess Consort). The former is the higher title of a male member of the Imperial family while the latter is the lower. Korea In the Joseon Dynasty, the title \\"Prince\\" was used for the king's male-line descendants. There were generally the divisions of princedom: the king's legitimate son used the title daegun (ÎåÄÍµ∞, Â§ßÂêõ, literally Grand Prince). A son born of a concubine as well as the great-great-grandsons of the king used the title gun (Íµ∞, Âêõ, lit. Prince). But the title of gun wasn't limited to the royal family. Instead, it was often granted as an honorary and non-hereditory title. As noble titles no longer exist in modern Korea, the English word \\"Prince\\" is now usually translated as wangja (ÏôïÏûê, ÁéãÂ≠ê, lit. king's son), referring to princes from non-Korean royal families. Princes and principalities in continental Europe are almost always confused with dukes and duchies in Korean speech, both being translated as gong (Í≥µ, ÂÖ¨, lit. duke) and gongguk (Í≥µÍµ≠, ÂÖ¨Âúã, lit. duchy). Sri Lanka The title 'Prince' was used for the King's son in Sinhalese generation in Sri Lanka. India Indian Prince And Parade Ceremony (by Edwin Lord Weeks) See princely states for the often particular, mainly Hindu titles in former British India, including modern Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Nepal. Indochina See Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos Philippines See Principalia, the Sultanate of Maguindanao and the Sultanate of Sulu. Thailand In Thailand (formerly Siam), the title of Prince was divided into three classes depending on the rank of their mothers. Those who were born of a king and had a royal mother (a queen or princess consort) are titled Chaofa Chai (: literally, \\"Male Celestial Lord\\"). Those born of a king and a commoner, or children of Chaofas, are tilted Phra Ong Chao (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤). The children of Phra Ong Chaos are titled Mom Chao (‡∏´‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤), abbreviated as M.C. (or ‡∏°.‡∏à.). =African traditions= A Western model was sometimes copied by emancipated colonial regimes (e.g. Bokassa I's short-lived Central-African Empire in Napoleonic fashion). Otherwise, most of the styles for members of ruling families do not lend themselves well to English translation. Nonetheless, in general the princely style has gradually replaced the colonialist title of \\"chief\\", which does not particularly connote dynastic rank to Westerners, e.g. Swazi Royal Family and Zulu Royal Family. Nominally ministerial chiefly titles, such as the Yoruba Oloye and the Zulu InDuna, still exist as distinct titles in kingdoms all over Africa. Title in religion Saint Robert Cardinal Bellarmine was a prince of the Roman Catholic Church during his lifetime. In states with an element of theocracy, this can affect princehood in several ways, such as the style of the ruler (e.g. with a secondary title meaning son or servant of a named divinity), but also the mode of succession (even reincarnation and recognition). Furthermore, certain religious offices may be considered of princely rank, or imply comparable temporal rights. The Prince-Popes, Pope, Hereditary Prince-Cardinals, Cardinals, Prince-Lord Bishops, Prince Bishops, Lord Bishops, Prince-Provost, and Prince-abbots are referred to as Princes of the Church. Also in Christianity, Jesus Christ is sometimes referred to as the Prince of Peace.This is a title for Jesus Christ (among others) given in Isaiah 9:6. Other titles for Jesus Christ are Prince of Princes,A title for Jesus Christ given in Daniel 8:25. Prince of the Covenant,A title for Jesus Christ given in Daniel 11:22. Prince of Life,A title for Jesus Christ given in Acts 3:15. and Prince of the Kings of the Earth.A title for Jesus Christ given in Revelation 1:5. Further, Satan is popularly titled the Prince of Darkness; and in the Christian faith he is also referred to as the Prince of this WorldA title for Satan given in John 12:31.A title for Satan given in John 14:30.A title for Satan given in John 16:11. and the Prince of the Power of the Air.A title for Satan given in Ephesians 2:2. Another title for Satan, not as common today but apparently so in approximately 30 A.D. by the Pharisees of the day, was the title Prince of the Devils.A title for Satan given in Matthew 9:34.A title for Satan given in Matthew 12:24.A title for Satan given in Mark 3:22. Prince of Israel, Prince of the Angels, and Prince of Light are titles given to the Archangel Michael. Some Christian churches also believe that since all Christians, like Jesus Christ, are children of God,One of several passages explaining that regenerate men are both children of God and co-heirs with His son Jesus Christ is given in Roman 8:17. then they too are princes and princesses of Heaven. Saint Peter, a disciple of Jesus, is also known as the Prince of the Apostles.

In modern English usage, the French word √©tiquette (ticket) dates from the year 1750.Etiquette, The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) Lesley Brown, Ed., p. 858. History At the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XIV used complicated √©tiquette to manage and control his courtiers and their politicking. In the third millennium BC, the Ancient Egyptian vizier Ptahhotep wrote The Maxims of Ptahhotep (2375‚Äì2350 BC), a didactic book of precepts extolling civil virtues, such as truthfulness, self-control, and kindness towards other people. Recurrent themes in the maxims include learning by listening to other people, being mindful of the imperfection of human knowledge, and that avoiding open conflict, whenever possible, should not be considered weakness. That the pursuit of justice should be foremost, yet acknowledged that, in human affairs, the command of a god ultimately prevails in all matters; thus some of Ptahhotep's maxims indicate a person's correct behaviours in the presence of great personages (political, military, religious). Instructions on how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Moreover, other maxims teach the correct way to be a leader through openness and kindness, and that greed is the base of all evil, and should be guarded against, and that generosity towards family and friends is praiseworthy. Confucius (551‚Äì479 BC) was the Chinese intellectual and philosopher whose works emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, the pursuit of justice in personal dealings, and sincerity in all personal relations. Baldassare Castiglione (1478‚Äì1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier and diplomat, soldier, and author of The Book of the Courtier (1528), an exemplar courtesy book dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier during the Italian Renaissance. Louis XIV (1638‚Äì1715), King of France, used a codified etiquette to tame the French nobility and assert his supremacy as the absolute monarch of France. In consequence, the ceremonious royal court favourably impressed foreign dignitaries whom the king received at the seat of French government, the Palace of Versailles, to the south-west of Paris. Politeness In the mid-18th century, Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, first used the word etiquette to mean \\"the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society.\\" (painting by William Hoare) In the 18th century, during the Age of Enlightenment, the adoption of etiquette was a self-conscious process for acquiring the conventions of politeness and the normative behaviours (charm, manners, demeanour) which symbolically identified the person as a genteel member of the upper class. To identify with the social √©lite, the upwardly mobile middle class and the bourgeoisie adopted the behaviours and the artistic preferences of the upper class. To that end, socially ambitious people of the middle classes occupied themselves with learning, knowing, and practising the rules of social etiquette, such as the arts of elegant dress and gracious conversation, when to show emotion, and courtesy with and towards women. In the early 18th century, Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, wrote influential essays that defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company; and discussed the function and nature of politeness in the social discourse of a commercial society: Periodicals, such as The Spectator, a daily publication founded in 1711 by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, regularly advised their readers on the etiquette required of a gentleman, a man of good and courteous conduct; their stated editorial goal was \\"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality . . . to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\\"; to which end, the editors published articles written by educated authors, which provided topics for civil conversation, and advice on the requisite manners for carrying a polite conversation, and for managing social interactions. In the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create Netiquette, which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on. Conceptually allied to etiquette is the notion of civility (social interaction characterised by sober and reasoned debate) which for socially ambitious men and women also became an important personal quality to possess for social advancement.Cowan, 2005. p. 101. In the event, gentlemen's clubs, such as Harrington's Rota Club, published an in-house etiquette that codified the civility expected of the members. Besides The Spectator, other periodicals sought to infuse politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, the editors of The Tatler were explicit that their purpose was the reformation of English manners and morals; to those ends, etiquette was presented as the virtue of morality and a code of behaviour.Mackie, 1998. p. 1. In the mid-18th century, the first, modern English usage of etiquette (the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society) was by Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, in the book Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman (1774), a correspondence of more than 400 letters written from 1737 until the death of his son, in 1768; most of the letters were instructive, concerning varied subjects that a worldly gentleman should know.Mayo, Christopher \\"Letters to His Son\\", The Literary Encyclopedia, 25 February 2007 accessed 30 November 2011. The letters were first published in 1774, by Eugenia Stanhope, the widow of the diplomat Philip Stanhope, Chesterfield's bastard son. Throughout the correspondence, Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the matter of social manners from conventional morality, with perceptive observations that pragmatically argue to Philip that mastery of etiquette was an important means for social advancement, for a man such as he. Chesterfield's elegant, literary style of writing epitomised the emotional restraint characteristic of polite social intercourse in 18th- century society: In the 19th century, Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) etiquette had developed into a complicated system of codified behaviours, which governed the range of manners in society ‚Äî from the proper language, style, and method for writing letters, to correctly using cutlery at table, and to the minute regulation of social relations and personal interactions between men and women and among the social classes. Manners In High-Change in Bond Street, ‚Äî ou ‚Äî la Politesse du Grande Monde (1796), James Gillray caricatured the lack of etiquette in a group of Englishmen leering at women, by crowding them off the sidewalk. = Sociological perspectives= In a society, manners are described as either good manners or as bad manners to indicate to a person whether or not his or her behavior is acceptable to the cultural group. As such, manners enable ultrasociality and are integral to the functioning of the social norms and conventions that are informally enforced through personal self-regulation in public life and in private life. The perspectives of sociology indicate that manners are a means for men and women to display their social status, and a means of demarcating, observing, and maintaining the boundaries of social identity and of social class.Richerson and Boyd, \\"The Evolution of Human Ultra Sociality\\", in Ideology, Warfare, and Indoctrinability (1997), Eibl-Eibisfeldt I. and Salyer F. Eds. In The Civilizing Process (1939), the sociologist Norbert Elias said that manners arose as a product of group living, and persist as a way of maintaining social order. That manners proliferated during the Renaissance in response to the development of the ‚Äòabsolute state‚Äô ‚Äî the progression from small-group living to large-group living characterised by the centralized power of the State. That the rituals and manners associated with the royal court of England during that period were closely bound to a person's social status. That manners demonstrate a person's position within a social network, and that a person's manners are a means of negotiation from that social position.Norbert Elias, \\"The Civilizing Process\\", Oxford Blackwell Publishers, 1994 From the perspective of public health, in The Healthy Citizen (1996), Alana R. Petersen and Deborah Lupton said that manners assisted the diminishment of the social boundaries that existed between the public sphere and the private sphere of a person's life, and so gave rise to ‚Äúa highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts, socially‚Äù; and that ‚Äúthe public behavior of individuals came to signify their social standing; a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others, and thus the control of the outward self was vital.‚ÄùPetersen A., Lupton D., \\"The Healthy Citizen\\" in The New Public Health ‚Äî Discourses, Knowledges, Strategies (1996) London, SAGE. Moreover, the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu applied the concept of habitus towards understanding the societal functions of manners. The habitus is the set of mental attitudes, personal habits, and skills that a person possesses, his and her dispositions of character that are neither self-determined, nor pre- determined by the external environment, but which are produced and reproduced by social interactions; and are ‚Äúinculcated through experience and explicit teaching‚Äù ‚Äî yet tend to function at the subconscious level.Jenkins R. \\"Pierre Bourdieu (Key Sociologists) (2002) Cornwall, Routledge. Therefore, manners are likely to be a central part of the dispositions that guide a person‚Äôs ability to decide upon socially-compliant behaviours.Bourdieu Pierre, \\"Outline of a Theory of Practice (1977) Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. =Anthropological perspectives= In Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (2003) the anthropologist Mary Douglas said that the unique manners, social behaviors, and group rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or defile the integrity of the culture. That ideas of pollution, defilement, and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behaviour in order to curtail unacceptable behaviour, and so maintain ‚Äúthe assumptions by which experience is controlled‚Äù within the culture.Douglas M., \\"Purity and Danger ‚Äì An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo London, Routledge, 2003 = Evolutionary perspectives= In studying the expression of emotion by humans and animals, the naturalist Charles Darwin noted the universality of facial expressions of disgust and shame among infants and blind people, and concluded that the emotional responses of shame and disgust are innate behaviours.Darwin C., The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals London, Penguin, 2009 The public health specialist Valerie Curtis said that the development of facial responses was concomitant with the development of manners, which are behaviours with an evolutionary role in preventing the transmission of diseases, thus, people who practise personal hygiene and politeness will most benefit from membership in their social group, and so stand the best chance of biological survival, by way of opportunities for reproduction.Curtis V. Don‚Äôt Look, Don't Touch ‚Äì The Science Behind Revulsion Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013. Curtis V., Aunger R., and Rabie T. \\"Evidence that Disgust Evolved to Protect from Risk of Disease Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271 Supplement: S131‚Äì33., 2004. From the study of the evolutionary bases of prejudice, the social psychologists Catherine Cottrell and Steven Neuberg said that human behavioural responses to ‚Äòotherness‚Äô might enable the preservation of manners and social norms.Neuberg SL., Cottrell CA. \\"Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices\\" in Evolution and Social Psychology, Schaller M. et al., Eds., New York, Psychology Press, 2006. That the feeling of \\"foreignness\\" ‚Äî which people experience in their first social interaction with someone from another culture ‚Äî might partly serve an evolutionary function: 'Group living surrounds one with individuals [who are] able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to \\"free ride\\" on their efforts'; therefore, a commitment to sociality is a risk: 'If threats, such as these, are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group \\"living\\", individual group members should be attuned to others‚Äô features or behaviors.' Therefore, people who possess the social traits common to the cultural group are to be trusted, and people without the common social traits are to be distrusted as ‚Äòothers‚Äô, and thus treated with suspicion or excluded from the group. That pressure of social exclusivity, born from the shift towards communal living, excluded uncooperative people and persons with poor personal hygiene. The threat of social exclusion led people to avoid personal behaviours and that might embarrass the group or that might provoke revulsion among the group.Curtis V. \\"Don‚Äôt Look, Don't Touch ‚Äî The Science Behind Revulsion\\" Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013 To demonstrate the transmission of social conformity, the anthropologists Joseph Henrich and Robert Boyd developed a behavioural model indicating that manners are a means of mitigating social differences, curbing undesirable personal behaviours, and fostering co-operation within the social group. That natural selection has favoured the acquisition of genetically-transmitted mechanisms for learning, thereby increasing a person's chances for acquiring locally adaptive behaviours: ‚ÄúHumans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and [to] punish individuals who do not punish norm-violators.‚ÄùHenrich J., Boyd R. \\"The Evolution of Conformist Transmission and the Emergence of Between Group Differences\\" in Evolution and Human Behavior, 19(4):215‚Äì41, 1998. =Categories= Social manners are in three categories: (i) manners of hygiene, (ii) manners of courtesy, and (iii) manners of cultural norm, each category accounts for an aspect of the functional role that manners play in a society. The categories of manners are based upon the social outcome of behaviour, rather than upon the personal motivation of the behaviour. As a means of social management, the rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of human social interaction; thus, a rule of etiquette reflects an underlying ethical code, and can reflect a person's fashion and social status. (i) Hygiene Manners ‚Äî are the manners that concern avoiding the transmission of disease, and usually are taught by the parent to the child by way of parental discipline, positive behavioural enforcement of body-fluid continence (toilet training), and the avoidance of and removal of disease vectors that risk the health of children. To that effect, society expects that, by adulthood, the manners for personal hygiene have become a second-nature behaviour, the violations of which shall provoke physical and moral disgust. (ii) Courtesy Manners ‚Äî are the manners of self- control and good-faith behaviour, by which a person gives priority to the interests of another person, and priority to the interests of a socio-cultural group, in order to be a trusted member of that group. Courtesy manners maximize the benefits of group-living, by regulating the nature of social interactions; however, the performance of courtesy manners occasionally interferes with the avoidance of communicable disease. Generally, parents teach courtesy manners in the same way they teach hygiene manners, but the child also learns manners directly (by observing the behaviour of other people in their social interactions) and by imagined social interactions (through the executive functions of the brain). A child usually learns courtesy manners at an older age than when he or she was toilet trained (taught hygiene manners), because learning the manners of courtesy requires that the child be self-aware and conscious of social position, which then facilitate understanding that violations (accidental or deliberate) of social courtesy will provoke peer disapproval within the social group. (iii) Cultural Norm Manners ‚Äî are the manners of culture and society by which a person establishes his and her identity and membership in a given socio-cultural group. In observing and abiding the manners of cultural norm, a person demarcates socio-cultural identity and establishes social boundaries, which then identify whom to trust and whom to distrust as 'the other', who is not the self. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation with and the routinisation of ‚Äòthe familiar‚Äô, and through social exposure to the ‚Äòcultural otherness‚Äô of people identified as foreign to the group. Transgressions and flouting of the manners of cultural norm usually result in the social alienation of the transgressor. The nature of culture-norm manners allows a high level of between-group variability, but the manners usually are common to the people who identify with the given socio-cultural group. =Courtesy books= ; 16th century The Book of the Courtier (1528), by Baldassare Castiglione, identified the manners and the morals required by socially ambitious men and women for success in a royal court of the Italian Renaissance (14th‚Äì17th c.); as an etiquette text, The Courtier was an influential courtesy book in 16th-century Europe. On Good Manners for Boys (1530), by Erasmus of Rotterdam, instructs boys in the means of becoming a young man; how to walk and talk, speak and act in the company of adults. The practical advice for acquiring adult self- awareness includes explanations of the symbolic meanings ‚Äî for adults ‚Äî of a boy's body language when he is fidgeting and yawning, scratching and bickering. On completing Erasmus's curriculum of etiquette, the boy has learnt that civility is the point of good manners; the adult ability to 'readily ignore the faults of others, but avoid falling short, yourself,' in being civilised.Rotterdam, E. of. A Handbook on Good Manners for Children: De civilitate morum puerilium libellus (1536) E. Merchant, Ed. (English tr.). London: Preface Publishing. ; 20th century Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home (1922), by Emily Post documents the \\"trivialities\\" of desirable conduct in daily life, and provided pragmatic approaches to the practice good manners; the social conduct expected and appropriate for the events of life, such as a baptism, a wedding, and a funeral.Post, P., Post, A., Post, L., & Senning, D. P. Emily Post‚Äôs Etiquette, 18th Edition (2011) New York: William Morrow. As didactic texts, books of etiquette (the conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society) usually feature explanatory titles, such as The Ladies' Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness: A Complete Hand Book for the Use of the Lady in Polite Society (1860), by Florence Hartley; Amy Vanderbilt‚Äôs Complete Book of Etiquette (1957), by Amy Vanderbilt;Vanderbilt, A.

Moreover, the How Rude! comic-book series addresses and discusses adolescent perspectives and questions of etiquette, social manners, and civility.Ellen R. Delisio, \\"Teaching Manners in a Manner-less World\\", Education World, 4 July 2005. Accessed 27 July 2018. =Business= In commerce, the purpose of etiquette is to facilitate the social relations necessary for realising the business transactions of buying and selling goods and services; in particular, the social interactions among the workers, and between labour and management. Business etiquette varies by culture, such as the Chinese and Australian approaches to conflict resolution. The Chinese business philosophy is based upon guanxi (personal connections), whereby person-to-person negotiation resolves difficult matters, whereas Australian business philosophy relies upon attorneys-at-law to resolve business conflicts through legal mediation; thus, adjusting to the etiquette and professional ethics of another culture is an element of culture shock for businesspeople. In 2011, etiquette trainers formed the Institute of Image Training and Testing International (IITTI) a non-profit organisation to train personnel departments in measuring and developing and teaching social skills to employees, by way of education in the rules of personal and business etiquette, in order to produce business workers who possess standardised manners for successfully conducting business with people from other cultures. In the retail branch of commerce, the saying: \\"The customer is always right.\\" summarises the profit-orientation of good manners, between the buyer and the seller of goods and services: See also Etiquette and language * Acrolect * Aizuchi * Basilect * Honorific title * Honorifics (linguistics) - politeness markers * Insult * Netiquette * Polite fiction * Prescription and description * Profanity * Semantics * Slang * Slang dictionary * Standard language * Style of address * T‚ÄìV distinction * What happens on tour, stays on tour Etiquette and letters * Airmail etiquette * Email etiquettes * Missed call#Social usage Etiquette and society * Ali√©nor de Poitiers early documentor of French etiquette * Code of conduct * Church etiquette * Cigar etiquette * Cinema etiquette * Civics * Concert etiquette * Dance etiquette * Debrett's * Diplomacy * Disability etiquette * Drinking etiquette * Driving etiquette * Escalator etiquette * Faux pas, Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation * Golf etiquette * Intercultural competence * Lev√©e, the English version of Louis XIV's morning rising etiquette (lever) at Versailles. * Military courtesy * Order of precedence * Protocol * Respect * Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation by George Washington * Rudeness * Social graces * Social Norms * Table manners Eating utensil etiquette * Technology  Cell phone  Gaming * Work Etiquette * Zigzag method Worldwide etiquette * Africa * Asia  Chinese dining  Indian dining  Indonesia  Japan  Myanmar  Pakistan  South Korea * Australia and New Zealand * Europe  Dutch customs and etiquette * Latin America * Middle East * North America * Islamic Etiquette  Islamic toilet etiquette References Further reading       JSTOR     ‚Äì proper etiquette for men and women * and Emily Post's book Etiquette in Society in Business in Politics and at Home were the U.S. etiquette bibles of the 1950s‚Äì1970s era. * External links * House of Protocol @houseofprotocol.com * Modern Etiquette @modernetiquette.com * Habits Popular culture Morality ","title":"Etiquette"},{"id":"51513","text":"Traditional target arrow (top) and replica medieval arrow (bottom). Modern arrow with plastic fletchings and nock. An arrow is a fin-stabilized projectile that is launched via a bow, and usually consists of a long straight stiff shaft with stabilizers called fletchings, as well as a weighty (and usually sharp and pointed) arrowhead attached to the front end, and a slot at the rear end called the nock for engaging the bowstring. The use of bows and arrows by humans predates recorded history and is common to most cultures. A craftsman who makes arrows is a fletcher, and one that makes arrowheads is an arrowsmith.Paterson Encyclopaedia of Archery p. 56 History The oldest evidence of stone-tipped projectiles, which may or may not have been propelled by a bow (c.f. atlatl), dating to c. 64,000 years ago, were found in Sibudu Cave, current South Africa. Arrowheads made from animal bones have been discovered in the Fa Hien Cave in Sri Lanka which are also the oldest evidence for the use of arrows outside of Africa dating to c. 48,000 years ago. Lyn Wadley from the University of the Witwatersrand (2010); BBC: Oldest evidence of arrows found The oldest evidence of the use of bows to shoot arrows dates to about 10,000 years ago; it is based on pinewood arrows found in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow.McEwen E, Bergman R, Miller C. Early bow design and construction. Scientific American 1991 vol. 264 pp76-82. The oldest bow so far recovered is about 8,000 years old, found in the Holmeg√•rd swamp in Denmark. Archery seems to have arrived in the Americas with the Arctic small tool tradition, about 4,500 years ago.  Size  Schematic of an arrow with many parts. Arrow sizes vary greatly across cultures, ranging from eighteen inches to six feet (45 cm to 150 cm).Stone, George Cameron (1934). A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor in All Countries and in All Times, Mineola: Dover Publications. However, most modern arrows are to in length. Arrows recovered from the Mary Rose, an English warship that sank in 1545 were mostly long.Anon: The Mary Rose; Armament p.7 Very short arrows have been used, shot through a guide attached either to the bow (an \\"overdraw\\") or to the archer's wrist (the Turkish \\"siper\\").Turkish Archery and the Composite Bow. Paul E. Klopsteg These may fly farther than heavier arrows, and an enemy without suitable equipment may find himself unable to return them. = Shaft = A sideprofile of an Easton Carbon One arrow with a spine of 900, taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The arrow is a bond of two carbon tubes, an inner and an outer tube (black wires). In between both carbon layers, another fiber is used (white fiber). This second fiber is an Mg-Al-Si-fiber. The \\"white\\" fiber is twisted around the inner carbon tube. The fibers of the carbon tubes are not twisted, to ensure a maximum of possible mechanical tension of the arrow. The Mg-Al-Si- fiber enhances the flexibility of the arrow. The diameter of a single carbon fiber is approx. 7 ¬µm. The shaft is the primary structural element of the arrow, to which the other components are attached. Traditional arrow shafts are made from strong, lightweight wood, bamboo or reeds, while modern shafts may be made from aluminium, carbon fibre reinforced plastic, or a combination of materials. Such shafts are typically made from an aluminium core wrapped with a carbon fibre outer. A traditional premium material is Port Orford Cedar.  Spine  The stiffness of the shaft is known as its spine, referring to how little the shaft bends when compressed, hence an arrow which bends less is said to have more spine. In order to strike consistently, a group of arrows must be similarly spined. \\"Center-shot\\" bows, in which the arrow passes through the central vertical axis of the bow riser, may obtain consistent results from arrows with a wide range of spines. However, most traditional bows are not center-shot and the arrow has to deflect around the handle in the archer's paradox; such bows tend to give most consistent results with a narrower range of arrow spine that allows the arrow to deflect correctly around the bow. Bows with higher draw weight will generally require stiffer arrows, with more spine (less flexibility) to give the correct amount of flex when shot.  GPI rating  The weight of an arrow shaft can be expressed in GPI (grains per inch).GPI explained by an arrow vendor (referred to from their listing of carbon arrows) The length of a shaft in inches multiplied by its GPI rating gives the weight of the shaft in grains. For example, a shaft that is long and has a GPI of 9.5 weighs . This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.  Footed arrows  Sometimes a shaft will be made of two different types of wood fastened together, resulting in what is known as a footed arrow. Known by some as the finest of wood arrows, footed arrows were used both by early Europeans and Native Americans. Footed arrows will typically consist of a short length of hardwood near the head of the arrow, with the remainder of the shaft consisting of softwood. By reinforcing the area most likely to break, the arrow is more likely to survive impact, while maintaining overall flexibility and lighter weight. Barreled arrow shafts A barreled arrow shaft is one that tapers in diameter bi- directionally. This allows for an arrow that has an optimum weight yet retains enough strength to resist flex. A Qing dynasty arrow shaft was examined by archery enthusiast Peter Dekker and found to exhibit the following qualities:http://www.manchuarchery.org/manchu-war-arrows *Total shaft length: *Thickness at waist line: *Thickness at end of feather: *Thickness from end: *Thickness from end: *Thickness from end: *Thickness from end: *Thickness at end: The resultant point-of-balance of the arrow shaft was thus 38.5% of the length of the arrow from the tip. Barreled arrow shafts are considered the zenith of pre-industrial archery technology, reaching their peak design among the Ottomans.https://eastonarchery.com/2018/12/arrow-shaft-design-and- performance/http://www.turkishculture.org/lifestyles/turkish-culture- portal/turkish-flight-arrows-554.htm = Arrowhead = Obsidian broadhead Ancient Greek bronze arrowhead, 4th century BC, from Olynthus, Chalcidice Various Japanese arrowheads Native American arrowheads 20th century field points Modern replicas of various medieval European arrowheads The arrowhead or projectile point is the primary functional part of the arrow, and plays the largest role in determining its purpose. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, horn, or some other hard material. Arrowheads are usually separated by function: *Bodkin points are short, rigid points with a small cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron and may have been used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research has found no hardened bodkin points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated Damascus chain armour. However, archery was not effective against plate armour, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century.Strickland M, Hardy R. The Great Warbow. Sutton Publishing 2005. Page 272 *Blunts are unsharpened arrowheads occasionally used for types of target shooting, for shooting at stumps or other targets of opportunity, or hunting small game when the goal is to concuss the target without penetration. Blunts are commonly made of metal or hard rubber. They may stun, and occasionally, the arrow shaft may penetrate the head and the target; safety is still important with blunt arrows. *Judo points have spring wires extending sideways from the tip. These catch on grass and debris to prevent the arrow from being lost in the vegetation. Used for practice and for small game. *Broadheads were used for war and are still used for hunting. Medieval broadheads could be made from steel, sometimes with hardened edges. They usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive bleeding in the victim. Their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill as quickly as possible by cleanly cutting major blood vessels, and cause further trauma on removal. They are expensive, damage most targets, and are usually not used for practice. :There are two main types of broadheads used by hunters: the fixed-blade and the mechanical types. While the fixed- blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies better because it is more streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades. However, hunters recommend mechanical broadheads for hunting big animals like elk, moose, american bison etc. *Field tips are similar to target points and have a distinct shoulder, so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps. They are also used for shooting practice by hunters, by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as broadheads, without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal. *Target points are bullet-shaped with a conical point, designed to penetrate target butts easily without causing excessive damage to them. *Safety arrows are designed to be used in various forms of reenactment combat, to reduce the risk when shot at people. These arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded, such as the large foam ball tip used in archery tag. In combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length, these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armoured people. The parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants. For instance, SCA combat rules require a padded head at least in diameter, with bows not exceeding and of draw for use against well-armoured individuals.SCA marshall's handbook Arrowheads may be attached to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire. = Fletchings = Straight parabolic fletchings on an arrow. Fletchings are found at the back of the arrow and act as airfoils to provide a small amount of force used to stabilize the flight of the arrow. They are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly damping down any tendency to pitch or yaw. Some cultures, for example most in New Guinea, did not use fletching on their arrows.Gardens of War: Life and Death in the New Guinea Stone Age. Robert Gardner. Deutsch 1969. , Also, arrows without fletching (called bare shaft) are used for training purposes, because they make certain errors by the archer more visible. Fletchings are traditionally made from feathers (often from a goose or turkey) bound to the arrow's shaft, but are now often made of plastic (known as \\"vanes\\"). Historically, some arrows used for the proofing of armour used copper vanes. Flight archers may use razor blades for fletching, in order to reduce air resistance. With conventional three-feather fletching, one feather, called the \\"cock\\" feather, is at a right angle to the nock, and is normally nocked so that it will not contact the bow when the arrow is shot. Four-feather fletching is usually symmetrical and there is no preferred orientation for the nock; this makes nocking the arrow slightly easier. Natural feathers are usually prepared by splitting and sanding the quill before gluing. Further, the feather may be trimmed to shape, die-cut or burned by a hot electrically-heated wire. It's crucial that all the feathers of an arrow have the same drag, so manual trimming is rarely used by modern fletchers. The burning-wire method is popular because different shapes are possible by bending the wire, and the fletching can be symmetrically trimmed after gluing by rotating the arrow on a fixture. Some fletchings are dyed. Two-toned fletchings usually make each fletching from two feathers knit together. The front fletching is often camouflaged, and the rear fletching bright so that the archer can easily track the arrow. Artisans who make arrows by hand are known as \\"fletchers,\\" a word related to the French word for arrow, fl√®che. This is the same derivation as the verb \\"fletch,\\" meaning to provide an arrow with its feathers. Glue and thread are the traditional methods of attaching fletchings. A \\"fletching jig\\" is often used in modern times, to hold the fletchings in exactly the right orientation on the shaft while the glue hardens. Whenever natural fletching is used, the feathers on any one arrow must come from the same wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers of turkeys. The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away. Artificial helical fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more. Fletchings generally range from in length; flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low fletching, while hunting arrows with broadheads require long and high fletching to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head. Fletchings may also be cut in different ways, the two most common being parabolic (i.e. a smooth curved shape) and shield (i.e. shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut. In modern archery with screw-in points, right-hand rotation is generally preferred as it makes the points self- tighten. In traditional archery, some archers prefer a left rotation because it gets the hard (and sharp) quill of the feather farther away from the arrow- shelf and the shooter's hand. A flu-flu is a form of fletching, normally made by using long sections of full length feathers taken from a turkey, in most cases six or more sections are used rather than the traditional three. Alternatively two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft. The extra fletching generates more drag and slows the arrow down rapidly after a short distance, about or so. Flu-Flu arrows are often used for hunting birds, or for children's archery, and can also be used to play Flu-Flu Golf. = Wraps = Wraps are thin pre-cut sheets of material, often vinyl or plastic, used to wrap the nock end of an arrow, primarily as an aid in bonding vanes and feather fletchings to the shaft. Wraps can also make the eventual removal of vanes and vane-glue easier. Additionally, they add a decorative aspect to arrow building, which can provide archers an opportunity to personalize their arrows. Brightly colored wraps can also make arrows much easier to find in the brush, and to see in downrange targets. = Nocks = In English it is common to say \\"nock an arrow\\" when one readies a shot. A nock is a notch in the rearmost end of an arrow. It helps keep the arrow correctly rotated. It also keeps the arrow from slipping sideways during the draw or after the release. It also helps maximize the arrow's energy (i.e. its range and lethality) by helping an archer place the arrow at the fastest-moving place on the bowstring. Some archers mark the nock position with beads, knots or wrappings of thread. The main purpose of a nock is to control the rotation of the arrow. Arrows bend when released. If the bend hits the bowstave, the arrow's aim will be thrown off. Wooden arrows have a preferred bending-plane. Synthetic arrows have a designed bending plane. Usually this plane is determined by the grain of the wood of the arrow, or the structure of a synthetic arrow. The nock's slot should be rotated at an angle chosen so that when the arrow bends, it avoids or slides on the bowstave. Almost always this means that the slot of the nock must be perpendicular to the wood's grain, viewed from behind. Self nocks are slots cut in the back of the arrow. These are simple, but can break at the base of the slot. Self nocks are often reinforced with glued servings of fiber near the base of the slot. The sturdiest nocks are separate pieces made from wood, plastic, or horn that are then attached to the end of the arrow.Massey, Jay(1992). \\"Self Arrows\\" in The Traditional Bowyer's Bible - Volume One, Guilford: The Lyons Press. Modern nocks, and traditional Turkish nocks, are often constructed so as to curve around the string or even pinch it slightly, so that the arrow is unlikely to slip off.Stone, G.C. \\"A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor in All Countries and in All Times\\" Ancient Arab archery sometimes used \\"nockless arrows\\". In shooting at enemies, Arabs saw them pick up Arab arrows and shoot them back. So Arabs developed bowstrings with a small ring tied where the nock would normally be placed. The rear end of the arrow would be sharpened to a point, rather than slit for a nock. The rear end of the arrow would slip into the ring. The arrow could be drawn and released as usual. Then the enemy could collect the arrows, yet not shoot them back with a conventional bow. Also, since there was no nock, the nock could not break, and the arrow was less expensive. A piece of battle advice was to have several rings tied to the bowstring in case one broke.Faris, Nabih Amin, and Robert Potter Elmer. Chapter XLIV. \\"On Stunt Shooting\\". IN: Arab archery. An Arabic manuscript of about A.D. 1500, \\"A book on the excellence of the bow & arrow\\" and the description thereof. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1945. Pages 131-132. A practical disadvantage compared to a nock would be preserving the optimal rotation of the arrow, so that when it flexes, it does not hit the bowstave. The bend direction of the arrow might have been indicated by its fletching. Finishes and cresting Arrows are usually finished so that they are not softened by rain, fog or condensation. Traditional finishes are varnishes or lacquers. Arrows sometimes need to be repaired, so it's important that the paints be compatible with glues used to attach arrowheads, fletchings and nocks. For this reason, arrows are rarely protected by waxing. Crests are rings or bands of paint, often brightly colored, applied to arrows on a lathe-like tool called a cresting machine, usually for the purpose of personalization. Like wraps, cresting may also be done to make arrows easier to see.

Mead, and colleagues, all formerly of Wright Aeronautical. Conceived and designed by Mead, the new engine would be a large, air-cooled, radial design. Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool was going through a period of self-revision at the time to prepare itself for the post-Great War era, discontinuing old product lines and incubating new ones. The Great War had been profitable to P&WMT;, but the peace brought a predictable glut to the machine tool market, as contracts with governments were canceled and the market in used, recently built tools competed against new ones. P&WMT;'s future growth would depend on innovation. Having idle factory space and capital available at this historical moment, to be invested wherever good return seemed available, P&WMT; saw the postwar aviation industry, both military and civil (commercial, private), as one with some of the greatest growth and development potential available anywhere for the next few decades. It lent Rentschler $250,000, the use of the Pratt & Whitney name, and space in their building. This was the beginning of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company. Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's first engine, the 425 horsepower (317 kW) R-1340 Wasp, was completed on Christmas Eve 1925. On its third test run it easily passed the Navy qualification test in March 1926; by October, the Navy had ordered 200. The Wasp exhibited performance and reliability that revolutionized American aviation. The R-1340 powered the aircraft of Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, and many other record flights. The R-1340 was followed by another very successful engine, the R-985 Wasp Junior.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 112, Cypress, CA, 2013. . Eventually a whole Wasp series was developed. Both engines are still in use in agricultural aircraft around the world and produce more power than their original design criteria. George Mead soon led the next step in the field of large, state-of- the-art, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines (which the Wasp dominated) when Pratt & Whitney released its R-1690 Hornet. It was basically \\"a bigger Wasp\\". In 1929, Rentschler ended his association with Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool and merged Pratt & Whitney Aircraft with Boeing and other companies to form the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. His agreement allowed him to carry the Pratt & Whitney name with him to his new corporation. Only five years later, the federal government banned common ownership of airplane manufacturers and airlines. Pratt & Whitney was merged with UATC's other manufacturing interests east of the Mississippi River as United Aircraft Corporation, with Rentschler as president. United Aircraft became UTC in 1975. =Recent= In October 2014, Pratt & Whitney was awarded a $592 million contract with US Defense Department to supply 36 F135 engines for the F-35 fighter. In January 2017, 10 employees reportedly left the company, including the head of the F135 engine program. Incurred expenses used to transport South Korean officials to the company's West Palm Beach facility in 2012 were deemed unethical, which led to the departure of the employees. Headquarters Pratt & Whitney is headquartered in East Hartford, Connecticut and also has plants in Londonderry, New Hampshire; Springdale, Arkansas; Columbus, Georgia; Middletown, Connecticut; Middletown, Pennsylvania; Dallas, Texas; Palm Beach County, Florida; North Berwick, Maine; Aguadilla, Puerto Rico; and Bridgeport, West Virginia. Pratt & Whitney holds the naming rights for the home stadium for the University of Connecticut Huskies football team, Rentschler Field, which is located adjacent to Pratt & Whitney's East Hartford, Connecticut campus, on Pratt's company-owned former airfield of the same name. In 2015, the stadium was renamed to Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in time for the 2015‚Äì2016 University of Connecticut football season. Divisions Pratt & Whitney is a business unit of aerospace conglomerate Raytheon Technologies, making it a sister company to Collins Aerospace, Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Raytheon Intelligence & Space. It is also involved in two major joint ventures, the Engine Alliance with GE which manufactures engines for the Airbus A380, and International Aero Engines company with Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines, and the Japanese Aero Engines Corporation which manufactures engines for the Airbus A320 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft. =Commercial engines= Pratt & Whitney's large commercial engines power more than 25 percent of the world‚Äôs passenger aircraft fleet and serve more than 800 customers in 160 countries. With more than 16,000 large commercial engines installed today, Pratt & Whitney provides power to hundreds of airlines and operators, from narrow-bodied airplanes to wide-bodied jumbo jetliners. In June 2007, Pratt & Whitney‚Äôs fleet of large commercial engines surpassed 1 billion flight hours of service. =Global Material Solutions= Pratt & Whitney‚Äôs Global Material Solutions (GMS) makes parts for the CFM56 engine thus giving customers an alternative in new CFM56 engine materials. In addition to engine parts, GMS provides customers with fleet management and customized maintenance service programs. United Airlines was the GMS launch customer.‚ÄúPratt & Whitney Boldly Enters PMA Parts Manufacturing Market‚Äù , Aviation Maintenance, April 1, 2006. GMS received its first part certification in July 2007, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted Parts Manufacturing Approval (PMA) certification for the GMS high-pressure turbine (HPT) shroud for the CFM56-3 engine. In March 2008, the FAA certified the GMS fan and booster with a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) with FAA Chapter 5 life limits equal to the original type certificate holder. The STC was the first FAA certification ever granted for alternative life-limited engine parts. In May 2008, Global Material Solutions received FAA STCs for its remaining life limited parts for CFM56-3 engines.‚ÄúPratt & Whitney Global Material Solutions Program on Track for Part Certifications‚Äù , Pratt & Whitney Press Release, July 15, 2008. =Global Service Partners= Pratt & Whitney Global Service Partners (GSP) offers overhaul, maintenance and repair services for Pratt & Whitney, International Aero Engines, General Electric, Rolls- Royce, and CFMI engines. In addition to engine overhaul and repair services, GSP provides services including line maintenance, engine monitoring and diagnostics, environmentally friendly on-wing water washes, leased engines, custom engine service programs and new and repaired parts. Pratt & Whitney maintains one of the largest service center networks in the world, with more than 40 engine overhaul and maintenance centers located around the globe. The Global Service Partners includes Japan Turbine Technologies (JTT). JTT started in 2000 as a joint venture between Pratt and Japan Airlines, with Japan Airlines owning 33.4 percent of the venture, and Pratt & Whitney owning the rest. In July 2011 Pratt bought out Japan Airlines' share in the venture. The facility is located in the town of Taiei near the city of Narita in the Chiba Prefecture and it primarily repairs V2500, JT8D engine parts. =Military Engines= Pratt & Whitney's Military Engines power 27 air forces around the globe, with nearly 11,000 military engines in service with 23 customers in 22 nations. Pratt & Whitney military engines include the F135 for the F-35 Lightning II, the F119 for the F-22 Raptor, the F100 family that powers the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Falcon, the F117 for the C-17 Globemaster III, the J52 for the EA-6B Prowler, the TF33 powering E-3 AWACS, E-8 Joint STARS, B-52, and KC-135 aircraft, and the TF30 for the F-111 and F-14A. In addition, Pratt & Whitney offers a global network of maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities and military aviation service centers focused on maintaining engine readiness for their customers. =Pratt & Whitney Canada= Pratt & Whitney Canada (PWC), originally Canadian Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company, and later United Aircraft of Canada, provides a large range of products, including turbofan, turboprop and turboshaft engines targeted for the regional, business, utility and military aircraft and helicopter markets. The company also designs and manufactures engines for auxiliary power units and industrial applications. Its headquarters are located in Longueuil, Quebec (just outside Montreal). Speaking to Reuters June 16, 2013, ahead of the Paris Airshow 2013, Pratt & Whitney President David Hess said he was confident that Canada would decide to stick with the F-35 program despite its recent discussions about having a new competition. If the orders did shift to another company, Pratt & Whitney could decide to move some of the industrial base work it is currently doing in Canada, Hess said. \\"We might reallocate the work elsewhere\\", he said, adding that reduced order volumes would likely trigger changes in Canada. The division admitted in July 2012 to providing engines and engine software for China's first attack helicopter, the Z-10. This violated U.S. export laws and resulted in a multimillion-dollar fine. =Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion= Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion consisted of liquid space propulsion at the Liquid Space Propulsion Division (West Palm Beach, Florida) and solid rocket propulsion at the Chemical Systems Division (San Jose, California), as well as refurbishment and integration of the non-motor elements of the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters at the USBI Co. Division (NASA Kennedy Space Center, Florida). Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion provided advanced technology solutions to commercial, government and military customers for more than four decades. Products included the RL10, the upper stage rocket engine used on the Boeing Delta and Lockheed Martin Atlas rockets, high-pressure turbopumps for the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) and the RD-180 booster engine, offered by RD Amross, a partnership between Pratt & Whitney and NPO Energomash of Russia, for the Atlas III and V programs. The West Palm Beach site consisted of an engineering division and manufacturing division which designed and manufactured the high-pressure turbopumps(Fuel and Lox) for the Space Shuttle's Main Engines (SSME) which were manufactured by the former Rocketdyne Corporation. =Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne= Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) was formed in 2005 when Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion and Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power were merged following the latter's acquisition from Boeing. P&W; Rocketdyne engines powered the Space Shuttle, and the company also supplies booster engines for Delta II rockets and boosters and upper stage engines for Atlas III and V and Delta IV rockets. In 2013, PWR was sold to GenCorp, which merged it with Aerojet to become Aerojet Rocketdyne. =Pratt & Whitney Power Systems= Pratt & Whitney Power Systems (PWPS) designs, builds, furnishes and supports aero-derivative gas turbine and geothermal power systems for customers worldwide. These industrial gas turbines power everything from small businesses to small cities. PWPS‚Äô industrial turbines not only generate electrical power, but provide variable speed mechanical drive for marine propulsion, gas compression, and liquid pumping. PWPS has over 2,000 industrial gas turbines installed in more than 40 countries worldwide. PWPS also provides parts and repairs for heavy-duty frame gas turbines as an OEM alternative.\\"Pratt & Whitney Power Systems Enters Into a Parts Agreement with Los Angeles Department of Water and Power\\" , PWPS press release, Feb. 11, 2008. In May 2013, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) sold its Pratt & Whitney Power Systems unit to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). =International Aero Engines= International Aero Engines is a joint venture that develops, builds and services the V2500 aero engine family, which powers the Airbus A320 family and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft. The four founding engine manufacturers that make up IAE each contribute an individual module to the V2500 engine. Pratt & Whitney produces the combustor and high- pressure turbine, Rolls-Royce the high-pressure compressor, JAEC the fan and low-pressure compressor and MTU the low-pressure turbine. =Engine Alliance= Engine Alliance, a 50/50 joint venture between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, was formed in August 1996 to develop, manufacture, and support a family of modern technology engines for new high-capacity, long- range aircraft.\\"A380 makes first U.S. stop on preparatory tour\\", Associated Press, Oct. 2, 2007, Stephanie Reitz. The main application is the GP7200, which has been designed for use on the Airbus A380. It competes with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900, the launch engine for the aircraft. The first GP7200-powered Airbus A380 entered service with Emirates on August 1, 2008, on a non-stop flight from Dubai to New York City.\\"GE/P&W; GP7200 To Debut on Emirates A380\\" , Aviation International News, July 17, 2008. =Motorsports= Between 1967 and 1971, Pratt & Whitney turbine engines were used in American Championship Car Racing and Formula One. The STP-Paxton Turbocar dominated the 1967 Indianapolis 500 until a transmission bearing failed four laps from the finish. STP entered four Lotus 56s in the 1968 Indianapolis 500. One car crashed during qualifying. Two of the remaining cars qualified fastest and second fastest, but all three retired from the race. Turbine cars were deemed illegal before the following year's race, so Lotus chief Colin Chapman developed the car for use in Formula One and an updated 56B competed in half a dozen Formula One races in 1971.

The company operated under several different names, starting out in 1912 in Schwerin, Germany, moving to the Netherlands in 1919. During its most successful period in the 1920s and 1930s, it dominated the civil aviation market. Fokker went into bankruptcy in 1996, and its operations were sold to competitors. History Fokker's first airplane, the Spin (Spider) (1910) =Fokker in Germany= At age 20, while studying in Germany, Anthony Fokker built his initial aircraft, the Spin (Spider)‚Äîthe first Dutch-built plane to fly in his home country. Taking advantage of better opportunities in Germany, he moved to Berlin, where in 1912, he founded his first company, Fokker Aeroplanbau, later moving to the G√∂rries suburb just southwest of Schwerin (at ), where the current company was founded, as Fokker Aviatik GmbH, on 12 February 1912.\\"Anthony Herman Gerard Fokker.\\" Fokker, A Living History. Retrieved: 19 December 2010. =World War I= Fokker capitalized on having sold several Fokker Spin monoplanes to the German government and set up a factory in Germany to supply the German Army in World War I. His first new design for the Germans to be produced in any numbers was the Fokker M.5, which was little more than a copy of the Morane-Saulnier G, built with steel tube instead of wood for the fuselage, and with minor alterations to the outline of the rudder and undercarriage and a new aerofoil section.Weyl 1965, pp. 65‚Äì67. When it was realized that arming these scouts with a machine gun firing through the arc of the propeller was desirable, Fokker developed a synchronization gear similar to that patented by Franz Schneider.Weyl 1965, p. 96. Fokker Eindecker in flight Fitted with a developed version of this gear, the M.5 became the Fokker Eindecker, which due to its revolutionary armament, became one of the most feared aircraft over the western front, its introduction leading to a period of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge which only ended with the introduction of new aircraft such as the Nieuport 11 and Airco DH.2. During World War I, Fokker engineers were working on the Fokker-Leimberger, an externally powered 12-barrel Gatling gun in the 7.92√ó57mm round claimed to be capable of firing over 7200 round per minute.\\"Motor Guns-A flashback to 1914‚Äì18.\\" Flight, 8 March 1957, pp. 313‚Äì314. Later in the war, after the Fokker D.V (the last design by earlier chief designer Martin Kreutzer), had failed to gain acceptance with the Luftstreitkr√§fte the German government forced Fokker (for their aircraft production expertise) and Junkers (for their pioneering all-metal airframe construction techniques, and advanced design concepts) to cooperate more closely, which resulted in the foundation of the Junkers-Fokker Aktiengesellschaft, or Jfa, on 20 October 1917. As this partnership proved to be troublesome, it was eventually dissolved. By then, former Fokker welder and new designer Reinhold Platz, who had taken the late Martin Kreutzer's place with the firm, had adapted some of Prof. Junkers' design concepts, that resulted in a visual similarity between the aircraft of those two manufacturers during the next decade. Some of the noteworthy types produced by Fokker during the second half of the war, all designed primarily by Herr Platz, included the Fokker D.VI biplane, Fokker Dr.I triplane or Dreidecker (remembered as a mount of the Red Baron), Fokker D.VII biplane (the only aircraft ever referred to directly in a treaty: all D.VII's were singled out for handover to the allies in their terms of the armistice agreement) and the Fokker D.VIII parasol monoplane. =Return to the Netherlands= In 1919, Fokker, owing large sums in back taxes (including 14,250,000 marks of income- tax),Weyl 1965, p.354. returned to the Netherlands and founded a new company near Amsterdam with the support of Steenkolen Handels Vereniging, now known as SHV Holdings. He chose the name Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek (Dutch Aircraft Factory) to conceal the Fokker brand because of his World War I involvement. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the Treaty of Versailles, Fokker did not return home empty-handed. In 1919, he arranged an export permit and brought six entire trains of parts, and 180 types of aircraft across the Dutch-German border, among them 117 Fokker C.Is, D.VIIs, and D.VIIIs. This initial stock enabled him to set up shop quickly. After his company's relocation, many Fokker C.I and C.IV military airplanes were delivered to Russia, Romania, and the still clandestine German air force. Success came on the commercial market, too, with the development of the Fokker F.VII, a high- winged aircraft capable of taking on various types of engines. Fokker continued to design and build military aircraft, delivering planes to the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Foreign military customers eventually included Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Hungary, and Italy. These countries bought substantial numbers of the Fokker C.V reconnaissance aircraft, which became Fokker's main success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. =1920s and 30s: Fokker's glory period= Fokker F.VII In the 1920s, Fokker entered its glory years, becoming the world's largest aircraft manufacturer by the late 1920s. Its greatest success was the 1925 F.VIIa/3m trimotor passenger aircraft, which was used by 54 airline companies worldwide and captured 40% of the American market in 1936. It shared the European market with the Junkers all-metal aircraft, but dominated the American market until the arrival of the Ford Trimotor which copied the aerodynamic features of the Fokker F.VII, and Junkers structural concepts. In 1923, Anthony Fokker moved to the United States, where in 1927, he established an American branch of his company, the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation, which was renamed the Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America. In 1930, this company merged with General Motors Corporation and the company's name became General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation, which in turn merged with North American Aviation and was divested by GM in 1948. In 1931, discontented at being totally subordinate to GM management, Fokker resigned. A serious blow to Fokker's reputation came after the 1931 crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air Fokker F-10 in Kansas, when it became known that the crash was caused by a structural failure caused by wood rot. Notre Dame legendary football coach Knute Rockne was among the fatalities, prompting extensive media coverage and technical investigation. As a result, all Fokkers were grounded in the US, along with many other types that had copied Fokker's wings. In 1934 Neville Shute of Airspeed Ltd (England) negotiated with Fokker himself for a manufacturing licensing agreement. In January 1935 Airspeed signed an agreement for the Douglas DC-2 and a number of Fokker types, with Fokker to be a consultant for seven years. Shute found him genial, shrewd and helpful but already a sick man; and he was difficult to deal with as his domestic life was irregular. Airspeed considered making the Fokker D.XVII for Greece, as Greece wanted to buy from Britain for currency reasons, but the proposal did not \\"come off\\"; Shute recommended reading his novel Ruined City on Balkan methods of business. And after a year the drift to war meant that Dutchmen could not go to the Airspeed factory or to board meetings. On December 23, 1939, Fokker died in New York City after a three-week illness. =World War II= At the outset of World War II, the few G.Is and D.XXIs of the Dutch Air Force were able to score a respectable number of victories against the Luftwaffe, but many were destroyed on the ground before they could be used. The Fokker factories were confiscated by the Germans and were used to build B√ºcker B√º 181 Bestmann trainers and parts for the Junkers Ju 52 transport. At the end of the war, the factories were completely stripped by the Germans and destroyed by Allied bombing. =Post-World War II rebuilding= Fokker-built Gloster Meteor of the Belgian Air Force in 1955 Rebuilding after the war proved difficult. The market was flooded with cheap surplus planes from the war. The company cautiously started building gliders and autobuses and converting Dakota transport planes to civilian versions. A few F25s were built. Nevertheless, the S-11 trainer was a success, being purchased by several air forces. The S-14 Machtrainer became one of the first jet trainers, and although not an export success, it served for over a decade with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. A new factory was built next to Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam in 1951. A number of military planes were built there under license, among them the Gloster Meteor twin-jet fighter and Lockheed's F-104 Starfighter. A second production and maintenance facility was established at Woensdrecht. The Fokker F-27 turboprop airliner In 1958, the F-27 Friendship was introduced, Fokker's most successful postwar airliner. The Dutch government contributed 27 million guilders to its development. Powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart, it became the world's best-selling turboprop airliner, reaching almost 800 units sold by 1986, including 206 under licence by Fairchild. Also, a military version of the F-27, the F-27 Troopship, was built. In 1962, the F-27 was followed by the jet-powered F-28 Fellowship. Until production stopped in 1987, a total of 241 were built in various versions. Both an F-27 and later an F-28 served with the Dutch Royal Flight, Prince Bernhard himself being a pilot. In 1969, Fokker agreed to an alliance with Bremen-based Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke under control of a transnational holding company. They collaborated on an unsuccessful regional jetliner, the VFW-614, of which only 19 were sold. This collaboration ended in early 1980. A Fokker-assembled Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 arrives for the Royal International Air Tattoo, England, (2014) Fokker was one of the main partners in the F-16 Fighting Falcon consortium (European Participating Air Forces), which was responsible for the production of these fighters for the Belgian, Danish, Dutch and Norwegian Air Forces. It consisted of companies and government agencies from these four countries and the United States. F-16s were assembled at Fokker and at SABCA in Belgium with parts from the five countries involved. =Aerospace= In 1967, Fokker started a modest space division building parts for European satellites. A major advance came in 1968 when Fokker developed the first Dutch satellite (the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite) together with Philips and Dutch universities. This was followed by a second major satellite project, IRAS, successfully launched in 1983. The European Space Agency in June 1974 named a consortium headed by ERNO-VFW-Fokker GmbH to build pressurized modules for Spacelab. Subsequently, Fokker contributed to many European satellite projects, as well as to the Ariane rocket in its various models. Together with a Russian contractor, they developed the huge parachute system for the Ariane 5 rocket boosters which would allow the boosters to return to Earth safely and be reused. The space division became more and more independent, until just before Fokker's bankruptcy in 1996, it became a fully stand-alone corporation, known successively as Fokker Space and Systems, Fokker Space, and Dutch Space. On 1 January 2006, it was taken over by EADS-Space Transportation. =Fokker 50, Fokker 100, and Fokker 70= Fokker 70, Fokker's last successful aircraft Fokker 100 After a brief and unsuccessful collaboration effort with McDonnell Douglas in 1981, Fokker began an ambitious project to develop two new aircraft concurrently. The Fokker 50 was to be a completely modernised version of the F-27, and the Fokker 100 a new airliner based on the F-28. Development costs were allowed to spiral out of control, almost forcing Fokker out of business in 1987. The Dutch government bailed the company out with 212 million guilders, but demanded Fokker look for a \\"strategic partner\\", British Aerospace and DASA being named most likely candidates. Initial sales of the Fokker 100 were good, leading Fokker to begin development of the Fokker 70, a smaller version of the F100, in 1991, but sales of the F70 were below expectations and the F100 had strong competition from Boeing and Airbus by then. In 1992, after a long and arduous negotiation process, Fokker signed an agreement with DASA. This did not solve Fokker's problems, though, mostly because DASA's parent company Daimler-Benz also had to deal with its own organisational problems. =Bankruptcy= On 22 January 1996, the board of directors of Daimler-Benz decided to focus on its core automobile business and cut ties with Fokker. The next day, an Amsterdam court extended temporary creditor protection. Discussions were initiated with Bombardier on 5 February 1996. After having reviewed and evaluated the opportunities and challenges Fokker represented at the time, Bombardier renounced its acquisition on 27 February. On 15 March, the Fokker company was declared bankrupt. Differences in national culture could have played a role in the failed takeover of Fokker by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA). Those divisions of the company that manufactured parts and carried out maintenance and repair work were taken over by Stork N.V.; it is now known as Stork Aerospace Group. Stork Fokker exists to sustain remarketing of the company's existing aircraft: it refurbishes and resells F 50s and F 100s, and has converted a few F 50s to transport aircraft. Special projects included the development of an F50 maritime patrol variant and an F100 executive jet. For this project, Stork received the 2005 \\"Aerospace Industry Award\\" in the Air Transport category from Flight International magazine. Other divisions of the company that were profitable continued as separate companies: Fokker Space (later Dutch Space) and Fokker Control Systems. In November 2009, Stork Aerospace changed its name to Fokker Aerospace Group. As of 2011, the Fokker Aerospace Group changed its name to Fokker Technologies. The five individual business units within Fokker Technologies all carry the Fokker name: * Fokker Aerostructures * Fokker Landing Gear * Fokker Elmo * Fokker Techniek * Fokker Services The former Fokker aircraft facilities at Schiphol were redeveloped into the Fokker Logistics Park.

The Defence) was the main paramilitary organization of the Jewish population (\\"Yishuv\\") in Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, when it became the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Formed out of previous existing militias, its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements from Arab attacks, such as the riots of 1920, 1921, 1929 and during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. It was under the control of the Jewish Agency, the official governmental body in charge of Palestine's Jewish community during the British Mandate. Until the end of the Second World War, Haganah's activities were moderate, in accordance with the policy of havlaga (\\"self-restraint\\"), which caused the splitting of the more radical Irgun and Lehi. The group received clandestine military support from Poland. Haganah sought cooperation with the British in the event of an Axis invasion of Palestine through North Africa, prompting the creation of the Palmach task force in 1941. With the end of World War II and British refusal to cancel the 1939 White Paper's restrictions on Jewish immigration, the Haganah turned to sabotage activities against the British authorities, including bombing bridges, rail lines, and ships used to deport illegal Jewish immigrants, as well as assisting in bringing Jews to Palestine in defiance of British policy. After the United Nations adopted a partition plan for Palestine in 1947, the Haganah came into the open as the biggest fighting force among Palestinian Jews, successfully overcoming Arab forces during the civil war. Shortly after Israel's independence declaration and the beginning of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Haganah was dissolved and became the official army of the state. History =Overview= The evolution of Jewish defense organisations in Palestine and later Israel went from small self-defense groups active during Ottoman rule, to ever larger and more sophisticated ones during the British Mandate, leading through the Haganah to the national army of Israel, the IDF. The evolution went step by step from Bar-Giora, to Hashomer, to Haganah, to IDF. The Jewish paramilitary organisations in the New Yishuv (the Zionist enterprise in Palestine) started with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914). The first such organization was Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907. It consisted of a small group of Jewish immigrants who guarded settlements for an annual fee. At no time did Bar-Giora have more than 100 members. It was converted to Hashomer (; \\"The Watchman\\") in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with a narrow scope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. During World War I, the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were the Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both of which were part of the British Army. After the Arab riots against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine with an organized structure, consisting of three main units‚Äîthe Field Corps, Guard Corps, and the Palmach strike force. During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the Jewish Brigade, which was joined by many Haganah fighters. During the 1947‚Äì48 civil war between the Arab and Jewish communities in what was still Mandatory Palestine, a reorganised Haganah managed to defend or wrestle most of the territory it was ordered to hold or capture. At the beginning of the ensuing 1948‚Äì49 full-scale conventional war against regular Arab armies, the Haganah was reorganised to become the core of the new Israel Defense Forces. =1920 and 1921 Arab riots= After the 1920 Arab riots and 1921 Jaffa riots, the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British, to whom the League of Nations had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920, had no desire to confront local Arab gangs that frequently attacked Palestinian Jews. Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect Jewish farms and kibbutzim. The first head of the Haganah was a 28 year-old named Yosef Hecht, a veteran of the Jewish Legion. In addition to guarding Jewish communities, the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs. In the period between 1920‚Äì1929, the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination. Haganah \\"units\\" were very localized and poorly armed: they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim. Following the 1929 Palestine riots, the Haganah's role changed dramatically. It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements, as well as thousands of members from the cities. It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create hand grenades and simple military equipment, transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army. =1931 Irgun split= Many Haganah fighters objected to the official policy of havlagah (restraint) that Jewish political leaders (who had become increasingly controlling of the Haganah) had imposed on the militia. Fighters had been instructed to only defend communities and not initiate counterattacks against Arab gangs or their communities. This policy appeared defeatist to many who believed that the best defense is a good offense. In 1931, the more militant elements of the Haganah splintered off and formed the Irgun Tsva'i-Leumi (National Military Organization), better known as \\"Irgun\\" (or by its Hebrew acronym, pronounced \\"Etzel\\"). =1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine= Haganah fighters guarding alt= During the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the Haganah worked to protect British interests and to quell Arab rebellion using the FOSH, and then Hish units. At that time, the Haganah fielded 10,000 mobilized men along with 40,000 reservists. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the Jewish Settlement Police, Jewish Supernumerary Police and Special Night Squads, which were trained and led by Colonel Orde Wingate. The battle experience gained during the training was useful in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. =Support from Poland= During the interwar period, as part of its policy of supporting a Jewish state in Palestine in order to facilitate mass Jewish emigration from its territory, the Second Polish Republic provided military training and weapons to Zionist paramilitary groups, including Haganah.A Marriage of Convenience: The New Zionist Organization and the Polish Government 1936-1939 Laurence Weinbaum In 1936, an agreement was reached between the Polish government and the Haganah in the person of its emissary, Arazi, Envoys from Haganah headed by Yehuda Arazi received dozens of shipments with military supplies, including 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on the Polish government to stop these deliveries. One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and two gliders. When he fled Poland to France, around 500 rifles were abandoned in a Warsaw warehouse.The Road to September 1939: Polish Jews, Zionists, and the Yishuv on the Eve of World War II (Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry) Brandeis University Press 2018 page 57-59 Members of the Haganah were also trained in a military camp in Rembertow along with Betar members between the years 1931 and 1937; it is estimated that training courses at the camp were attended by around 8,000 to 10,000 participants during their existence. Betar, Hagana i Irgun w polskiej szkole Polska Zbrojna 25.11.2018 =1939 White Paper= By 1939, the British had issued the White Paper, which severely restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, deeply angering the Zionist leadership. David Ben-Gurion, then chairman of the Jewish Agency, set the policy for the Zionist relationship with the British: \\"We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war.\\" In reaction to the White Paper, the Haganah built up the Palmach as the Haganah's elite strike force and organized illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. Approximately 100,000 Jews were brought to Palestine in over one hundred ships during the final decade of what became known as Aliyah Bet. The Haganah also organized demonstrations against British immigration quotas. =Patria disaster= alt= In 1940 the Haganah sabotaged the Patria, an ocean liner being used by the British to deport 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, with a bomb intended to cripple the ship. However the ship sank, killing 267 people and injuring 172. =World War II participation= Marching Jewish troops in the British army (1942) In the first years of World War II, the British authorities asked Haganah for cooperation again, due to the fear of an Axis breakthrough in North Africa. After Rommel was defeated at El Alamein in 1942, the British stepped back from their all-out support for Haganah. In 1943, after a long series of requests and negotiations, the British Army announced the creation of the Jewish Brigade Group. While Palestinian Jews had been permitted to enlist in the British army since 1940, this was the first time an exclusively Jewish military unit served in the war under a Jewish flag. The Jewish Brigade Group consisted of 5,000 soldiers and was initially deployed with the 8th Army in North Africa and later in Italy in September 1944. The brigade was disbanded in 1946. All in all, some 30,000 Palestinian Jews served in the British army during the war. On May 14, 1941, the Haganah created the Palmach (an acronym for Plugot Mahatz‚Äîstrike companies), an elite commando section, in preparation against the possibility of a British withdrawal and Axis invasion of Palestine. Its members, young men and women, received specialist training in guerilla tactics and sabotage.Yigal Allon, Sword of Zion. . pp. 116, 117. During 1942 the British gave assistance in the training of Palmach volunteers but in early 1943 they withdrew their support and attempted to disarm them.Allon, pp. 125, 126. The Palmach, then numbering over 1,000, continued as an underground organisation with its members working half of each month as kibbutz volunteers, the rest of the month spent training.Allon, p. 127. It was never large‚Äîby 1947 it amounted to merely five battalions (about 2,000 men)‚Äîbut its members had not only received physical and military training, but also acquired leadership skills that would subsequently enable them to take up command positions in Israel's army. =1944 Lord Moyne assassination and the Season= In 1944, after the assassination of Lord Moyne (the British Minister of State for the Middle East), by members of the Lehi, the Haganah worked with the British to kidnap, interrogate, and in some cases, deport Irgun members. This action, which lasted from November 1944 to February 1945, was called the Saison, or the Hunting Season, and was directed against the Irgun and not the Lehi. Future Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek was later revealed to be a Jewish Agency liaison officer working with the British authorities who had passed on information that led to the arrest of many Irgun activists.Andrew, Christopher (2009) The Defence of the Realm. The Authorized History of MI5. Allen Lane. . pp. 355, 356. Many Jewish youth, who had joined the Haganah in order to defend the Jewish people, were greatly demoralized by operations against their own people.Bell, Bowyer J.: Terror out of Zion The Irgun, paralyzed by the Saison, were ordered by their commander, Menachem Begin, not to retaliate in an effort to avoid a full blown civil war. Although many Irgunists objected to these orders, they obeyed Begin and refrained from fighting back. The Saison eventually ended due to perceived British betrayal of the Yishuv becoming more obvious to the public and increased opposition from Haganah members. =Post World War II= Haganah members in training (1947) Haifa Port (1947) The Saison officially ended when the Haganah, Irgun and the Lehi formed the Jewish Resistance Movement, in 1945. Within this new framework, the three groups agreed to operate under a joint command. They had different functions, which served to drive the British out of Palestine and create a Jewish state. The Haganah was less active in the Jewish Rebellion than the other two groups, but the Palmach did carry out anti-British operations, including a raid on the Atlit detainee camp that released 208 illegal immigrants, the Night of the Trains, the Night of the Bridges, and attacks on Palestine Police bases. The Haganah withdrew on 1 July 1946, but \\"remained permanently unco-operative\\" with the British authorities.Horne, Edward (1982). A Job Well Done (Being a History of The Palestine Police Force 1920‚Äì1948). The Anchor Press. . pp. 272, 288, 289 It continued to organize illegal Jewish immigration as part of the Aliyah Bet program, in which ships carrying illegal immigrants attempted to breach the British blockade of Palestine and land illegal immigrants on the shore (most were intercepted by the Royal Navy), and the Palmach performed operations against the British to support the illegal immigration program. The Palmach repeatedly bombed British radar stations being used to track illegal immigrant ships, and sabotaged British ships being used to deport illegal immigrants, as well as two British landing and patrol craft. The Palmach performed a single assassination operation in which a British official who had been judged to be excessively cruel to Jewish prisoners was shot dead.Ben- Yehuda, Nachman: Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice, pages 227‚Äì229 The Haganah also organized the Birya affair. Following the expulsion of the residents of the Jewish settlement of Birya for illegal weapons possession, thousands of Jewish youth organized by the Haganah marched to the site and rebuilt the settlement. They were expelled by British shortly afterward while showing passive resistance, but after they returned a third time, the British backed off and allowed them to remain. In addition to its operations, the Haganah continued to secretly prepare for a war with the Arabs once the British left by building up its arms and munitions stocks. It maintained a secret arms industry, with the most significant facility being an underground bullet factory underneath Ayalon, a kibbutz that had been established specifically to cover it up. British estimates of the Haganah's strength at this time were a paper strength of 75,000 men and women with an effective strength of 30,000.Horne. p. 288, 289. After the British army, the Haganah was considered the most powerful military force in the Middle East.The birth of Israel: Long, long road, economist.com. In July 1947, eager to maintain order with the visit of UNSCOP to Palestine and under heavy pressure from the British authorities to resume collaboration, the Jewish Agency reluctantly came into brief conflict with the Irgun and Lehi, and ordered the Haganah to put a stop to the operations of the other two groups for the time being. As Palmach members refused to participate, a unit of about 200 men from regular Haganah units was mobilized, and foiled several operations against the British, including a potentially devastating attack on the British military headquarters at Citrus House in Tel Aviv, in which a Haganah member was killed by an Irgun bomb. The Haganah also joined the search for two British sergeants abducted by the Irgun as hostages against the death sentences of three Irgun members in what became known as the Sergeants' affair. The Jewish Agency leadership feared the damage this act would do to the Jewish cause, and also believed that holding the hostages would only jeopardize the fates of the three condemned Irgun members. The attempts to free the sergeants failed, and following the executions of the three Irgun members, the two sergeants were killed and hanged in a eucalyptus grove. However, the campaign soon disintegrated into a series of retaliatory abductions and beatings of each other's members by the Haganah and Irgun, and eventually petered out. The campaign was dubbed the \\"Little Season\\" by the Irgun.Hoffman, Bruce: Anonymous Soldiers (2015) =Reorganisation= Theatre of Operation of each Haganah brigade. After 'having gotten the Jews of Palestine and of elsewhere to do everything that they could, personally and financially, to help Yishuv,' Ben- Gurion's second greatest achievement was his having successfully transformed Haganah from being a clandestine paramilitary organization into a true army.Ilan Papp√© (2000), p.79 Ben-Gurion appointed Israel Galili to the position of head of the High Command counsel of Haganah and divided Haganah into 6 infantry brigades, numbered 1 to 6, allotting a precise theatre of operation to each one. Yaakov Dori was named Chief of Staff, but it was Yigael Yadin who assumed the responsibility on the ground as chief of Operations. Palmach, commanded by Yigal Allon, was divided into 3 elite brigades, numbered 10‚Äì12, and constituted the mobile force of Haganah.Efra√Øm Karsh (2002), p. 31 Ben-Gurion's attempts to retain personal control over the newly formed IDF lead later in July to The Generals' Revolt.

The Haganah played the leading role in the Yishuv's war with the Palestinian Arabs. Initially, it concentrated on defending Jewish areas from Arab raids, but after the danger of British intervention subsided as the British withdrew, the Haganah went on the offensive and seized more territory. Following the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War on May 15, 1948, the Haganah, now the army of the new state, engaged the invading armies of the surrounding Arab states. On May 28, 1948, less than two weeks after the creation of the state of Israel on May 15, the provisional government created the Israel Defense Forces, merging the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, although the other two groups continued to operate independently in Jerusalem and abroad for some time after. The re-organisation led to several conflicts between Ben- Gurion and the Haganah leadership, including what was known as The Generals' Revolt and the dismantling of the Palmach. Famous members of the Haganah included Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, Rehavam Ze'evi, Dov Hoz, Moshe Dayan, Yigal Allon and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. The Museum of Underground Prisoners in Jerusalem commemorates the activity of the underground groups in the pre-state period, recreating the everyday life of those imprisoned there. =Pal-Heib Unit= Some Bedouins had longstanding ties with nearby Jewish communities.

Some were part of a Pal-Heib unit of the Haganah. Sheik Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef of Tuba was quoted in 1948 as saying, \\"Is it not written in the Koran that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations?

He is considered a founding father of plant pathology (phytopathology) as well as the founder of modern mycology. His extensive and careful studies of the life history of fungi and contribution to the understanding of algae and higher plants were landmarks of biology.  Biography  Born in Frankfurt, Anton de Bary was one of ten children born to physician August Theodor de Bary (1802‚Äì1873) and Emilie Meyer de Bary. His father encouraged him to join the excursions of the active group of naturalists who collected specimens in the nearby countryside. De Bary‚Äôs youthful interest in plants and in examination of fungi and algae were inspired by George Fresenius, a physician, who also taught botany at Senckenberg Institute. Fresenius was an expert on thallophytes. In 1848, de Bary graduated from a Gymnasium at Frankfurt, and began to study medicine at Heidelberg, continued at Marburg. In 1850, he went to Berlin to continue pursuing his study of medicine, and also continued to explore and develop his interest in plant science. He received his degree in medicine at Berlin in 1853, but his dissertation title was \\"De plantarum generatione sexuali\\", a botanical subject. The same year, he published a book on the fungi that caused rusts and smuts in plants. Early life After the graduation, de Bary practiced medicine in Frankfurt, but only for a very short period of time. He was drawn back to botany and became Privatdozent in botany at the University of T√ºbingen, where he worked as an assistant to Hugo von Mohl (1805‚Äì1872) for a while. In 1855, he succeeded the position of the well- known botanist Karl Wilhelm von N√§geli (1818‚Äì1891) at Freiburg, where he established the most advanced botanical laboratory at the time and directed many students. Marriage and academic work De Bary married Antonie Einert in 1861; they raised four children. In 1867, de Bary moved to the University of Halle to succeed the position of Professor Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal, who, with Hugo von Mohl, co-founded the pioneer botanical journal Botanische Zeitung. De Bary became its coeditor and later sole editor. As an editor of and contributor to the journal, he exercised great influence upon the development of botany. After the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), de Bary was appointed professor of botany at the University of Strasbourg, founder of the Jardin botanique de l'Universit√© de Strasbourg, and also elected as the inaugural rector (president) of the reorganized university. He conducted much research in the university botanical institute, attracted many students from Europe and America, and made a large contribution to the development of botany. =Fungi and plant diseases= De Bary was devoted to the study of the life history of fungi. At that time, various fungi were still considered to arise through spontaneous generation. He proved that pathogenic fungi were not the products of cell contents of the affected plants and did not arise from the secretion of the sick cells. In de Bary‚Äôs time, potato late blight had caused sweeping crop devastation and economic loss. He studied the pathogen Phytophthora infestans (formerly Peronospora infestans) and elucidated its life cycle. The origin of plant diseases was not known at that time. Much as Miles Joseph Berkeley (1803‚Äì1889) had insisted in 1841 that the oomycete found in potato blight was the cause of the disease, de Bary declared that the rust and smut fungi were the causes of the pathological changes in diseased plants. He concluded that Uredinales and Ustilaginales were parasites. De Bary spent much time studying the morphology of fungi and noticed that certain forms that had been classified as separate species were actually successive stages of development of the same organism. De Bary studied the developmental history of Myxomycetes (slime molds), and thought it was necessary to reclassify the lower animals. He first coined the term Mycetozoa to include lower animals and slime molds. In his work on Myxomycetes (1858), he pointed out that at one stage of their life cycle (the plasmodial stage), they were little more than formless, motile masses of the substance that F√©lix Dujardin (1801‚Äì1860) had called sarcode (protoplasm). This is the fundamental basis of the protoplasmic theory of life. De Bary was the first to demonstrate sexuality in fungi. In 1858, he had observed conjugation in the alga Spirogyra, and in 1861, he described sexual reproduction in the fungus Peronospora sp. He saw the necessity of observing the whole life cycle of pathogens and attempted to follow it in the living host plants. Peronosporeae De Bary published his first work on fungi in 1861, and then spent more than 15 years studying Peronosporeae, particularly Phytophthora infestans (formerly Peronospora infestans) and Cystopus (Albugo), parasites of potato. In his published work in 1863 entitled \\"Recherches sur le developpement de quelques champignons parasites\\", he reported having inoculated spores of P. infestans on healthy potato leaves and observed the penetration of the leaf and the subsequent growth of the mycelium that affected the tissue, the formation of conidia, and the appearance of the characteristic black spots of the potato blight. He also did similar experiments on potato stalks and tubers. He watched conidia in the soil and their infection of the tubers, observing that mycelium could survive the cold winter in the tubers. From all these studies, he concluded that organisms could not be generated spontaneously. Puccinia graminis He did a thorough investigation on Puccinia graminis, the pathogen of rust of wheat, rye and other grains. He noticed that P. graminis produced reddish summer spores called \\"urediospores\\", and dark winter spores called \\"teleutospores\\". He inoculated sporidia from the winter spores of the wheat rust on the leaves of the \\"common barberry\\" (Berberis vulgaris). The sporidia germinated and led to the formation of aecia with yellow spores, the familiar symptoms of infection on the barberry. De Bary then inoculated aecidiospores on moisture- retaining slides and then transferred them to the leaves of seedling of rye plants. In time, he observed the reddish summer spores appearing in the leaves. The sporidia from the winter spores germinated, but only on barberry. De Bary clearly demonstrated that P. graminis required different hosts during the different stages of its development (a phenomenon he called \\"heteroecism\\" in contrast to \\"autoecism\\", when development takes place only in one host). De Bary‚Äôs discovery explained why the eradication of the barberry plants had long been practiced as a control for rust. Lichen De Bary also studied the formation of lichens which are the result of an association between a fungus and an alga. He traced the stages through which they grew and reproduced and the adaptations that enabled them to survive drought and winter. He coined the word \\"symbiosis\\" in 1879 in his monograph \\"Die Erscheinung der Symbiose\\" (Strasbourg, 1879) as \\"the living together of unlike organisms\\". He carefully studied the morphology of molds, yeasts, and fungi and basically established mycology as an independent science. Conclusions De Bary's concept and methods had a great impact on the growing field of bacteriology and botany. He published more than 100 research papers and influenced many students who later became distinguished botanists and microbiologists such as Sergei Winogradsky (1856‚Äì1953), William Gilson Farlow (1844‚Äì1919), and Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet (1838‚Äì1902). He was one of the most influential of the 19th century bioscientists. De Bary died of a tumor of the jaw, having undergone extensive surgery, on January 19, 1888 in Strasburg.

Elias Magnus Fries FRS FRSE FLS RAS (15 August 1794 ‚Äì 8 February 1878) was a Swedish mycologist and botanist.  Career  Fries was born at Femsj√∂ (Hylte Municipality), Sm√•land, the son of the pastor there. He attended school in V√§xj√∂. He acquired an extensive knowledge of flowering plants from his father. In 1811 Fries entered Lund University where he obtained a doctorate in 1814. In the same year he was appointed an associate professorship in botany. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1824, became a full professor. In 1834 he became Borgstr√∂m professor (Swed. Borgstr√∂mianska professuren, a chair endowed by Erik Eriksson Borgstr√∂m, 1708‚Äì1770) in applied economics at Uppsala University. The position was changed to \\"professor of botany and applied economics\\" in 1851. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. That year he was also appointed director of the Uppsala University Botanical Garden. In 1853, he became rector of the University. Fries most important works were the three-volume Systema mycologicum (1821‚Äì1832), Elenchus fungorum (1828), the two-volume Monographia hymenomycetum Sueciae (1857 and 1863) and Hymenomycetes Europaei (1874). Fries is considered to be, after Christian Hendrik Persoon, a founding father of the modern taxonomy of mushrooms. His taxonomy of mushrooms was influenced by Goethe and the German romantics. He utilized spore color and arrangement of the hymenophore (pores, gills, teeth etc.) as major taxonomic characteristics.http://www.first- nature.com/fungi/~biog- fries.phphttp://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Elias_Magnus_Fries.aspx He died in Uppsala on 8 February 1878.

Later years He moved to Paris in 1802, where he spent the rest of his life, renting an upper floor of a house in a poor part of town. He was apparently unemployed, unmarried, poverty-stricken and a recluse, although he corresponded with botanists throughout Europe. Because of his financial difficulties, Persoon agreed to donate his herbarium to the House of Orange, in return for an adequate pension for life.Petersen R.H. (1977). Some brief reflections on C.H. Persoon. Kew Bulletin 31(3):695-98. Academic career The origin of Persoon's botanical interest is unknown. The earliest of his works was Abbildungen der Schw√§mme (Illustrations of the fungi), published in three parts, in 1790, 1791, and 1793. Between 1805 and 1807, he published two volumes of his Synopsis plantarum, a popular work describing 20,000 species of all types of plants. But his pioneering work was in the fungi, for which he published several works, beginning with the Synopsis methodica fungorum (1801); it is the starting point for nomenclature of the Uredinales, Ustilaginales, and the Gasteromycetes. Persoon described many polypore species; most were from his own collections in central Europe, while several other tropical species were sent to him from collections made by French botanist Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√© during his circumglobal expedition. These latter fungi are among the first tropical polypores ever described. In 1815, Persoon was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The genus Persoonia, a variety of small Australian trees and shrubs, was named after him. The title Persoonia is also given to a biannual scientific journal of molecular phylogeny and evolution of fungi, published jointly by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands and the CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre.

J. of the Chem., Metal. and Mining Soc. of South Africa 52 (6): 119‚Äì139 it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including petroleum geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, meteorology, oceanography, geochemistry, geometallurgy, geography, forestry, environmental control, landscape ecology, soil science, and agriculture (esp. in precision farming). Geostatistics is applied in varied branches of geography, particularly those involving the spread of diseases (epidemiology), the practice of commerce and military planning (logistics), and the development of efficient spatial networks. Geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places, including geographic information systems (GIS) and the R statistical environment. Background Geostatistics is intimately related to interpolation methods, but extends far beyond simple interpolation problems. Geostatistical techniques rely on statistical models that are based on random function (or random variable) theory to model the uncertainty associated with spatial estimation and simulation. A number of simpler interpolation methods/algorithms, such as inverse distance weighting, bilinear interpolation and nearest-neighbor interpolation, were already well known before geostatistics.Isaaks, E. H. and Srivastava, R. M. (1989), An Introduction to Applied Geostatistics, Oxford University Press, New York, USA. Geostatistics goes beyond the interpolation problem by considering the studied phenomenon at unknown locations as a set of correlated random variables. Let be the value of the variable of interest at a certain location . This value is unknown (e.g. temperature, rainfall, piezometric level, geological facies, etc.). Although there exists a value at location that could be measured, geostatistics considers this value as random since it was not measured, or has not been measured yet. However, the randomness of is not complete, but defined by a cumulative distribution function (CDF) that depends on certain information that is known about the value : :F(\\\\mathit{z}, \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\operatorname{Prob} \\\\lbrace Z(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\leqslant \\\\mathit{z} \\\\mid \\\\text{information} \\\\rbrace . Typically, if the value of is known at locations close to (or in the neighborhood of ) one can constrain the CDF of by this neighborhood: if a high spatial continuity is assumed, can only have values similar to the ones found in the neighborhood. Conversely, in the absence of spatial continuity can take any value. The spatial continuity of the random variables is described by a model of spatial continuity that can be either a parametric function in the case of variogram-based geostatistics, or have a non-parametric form when using other methods such as multiple-point simulationMariethoz, Gregoire, Caers, Jef (2014). Multiple-point geostatistics: modeling with training images. Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, UK, 364 p. or pseudo-genetic techniques. By applying a single spatial model on an entire domain, one makes the assumption that is a stationary process. It means that the same statistical properties are applicable on the entire domain. Several geostatistical methods provide ways of relaxing this stationarity assumption. In this framework, one can distinguish two modeling goals: # Estimating the value for , typically by the expectation, the median or the mode of the CDF . This is usually denoted as an estimation problem. # Sampling from the entire probability density function by actually considering each possible outcome of it at each location. This is generally done by creating several alternative maps of , called realizations. Consider a domain discretized in grid nodes (or pixels). Each realization is a sample of the complete -dimensional joint distribution function :: F(\\\\mathbf{z}, \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\operatorname{Prob} \\\\lbrace Z(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) \\\\leqslant z_1, Z(\\\\mathbf{x}_2) \\\\leqslant z_2, ..., Z(\\\\mathbf{x}_N) \\\\leqslant z_N \\\\rbrace . : In this approach, the presence of multiple solutions to the interpolation problem is acknowledged. Each realization is considered as a possible scenario of what the real variable could be. All associated workflows are then considering ensemble of realizations, and consequently ensemble of predictions that allow for probabilistic forecasting. Therefore, geostatistics is often used to generate or update spatial models when solving inverse problems.Hansen, T.M., Journel, A.G., Tarantola, A. and Mosegaard, K.

It is one of the principal passes of the Eastern Alpine range and has the lowest altitude among Alpine passes of the area. Dairy cattle graze in alpine pastures throughout the summer in valleys beneath the pass and on the mountains above it. At lower altitudes, farmers log pine trees, plant crops and harvest hay for winter fodder. Many of the high pastures are at an altitude of over ; a small number stand high in the mountains at around . The central section of the Brenner Pass covers a four- lane motorway and railway tracks connecting Bozen/Bolzano in the south and Innsbruck to the north. The village of Brenner consists of an outlet shopping centre (supermarkets and stores), fruit stores, restaurants, caf√©s, hotels and a gas station. It has a population of 400 to 600 ().  Etymology  Older, obsolete theories suggested a connection of the name Brenner with the ancient tribe of the Breuni or the Gaulish chieftain Brennus, but since the pass name appears for the first time only in the 14th century, a more recent etymology is far more likely.Alois Trenkwalder: Brenner. Bergdorf und Alpenpa√ü ‚Äì Brennero. Storia di un paesino e di un valico internazionale. Brenner 1999, p. 72 (online) Prenner was originally the name of a nearby farm, which itself was named after its former owner. The farm of a certain Prennerius is mentioned in documents in 1288, a certain Chunradus Prenner de Mittenwalde is mentioned in 1299. The German word Prenner probably refers to somebody who uses slash-and- burn techniques for land clearing. A name for the pass itself appears for the first time in 1328 as ob dem Prenner (German for above the Prenner).Egon K√ºhebacher (1991). Die Ortsnamen S√ºdtirols und ihre Geschichte, Bozen: Athesia, p. 59  History  = Roman Empire = Brenner and the surrounding Roman road network shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana. Brenner is between Matreio and Vepiteno. The Romans regularised the mountain pass at Brenner, which had already been under frequent use during the prehistoric eras since the most recent Ice Age.Walter Woodburn Hyde (1935). Roman Alpine Routes (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press), p. 194: \\"the use of the major pass-routes has been continuous from prehistoric times down to the present\\". The Brenner Pass, however, was not the first trans-Alpine Roman road to become regularised under the Roman Empire. The first Roman road to cross the Alpine range, Via Claudia Augusta, connected Verona in northern Italy with Augusta Vindelicorum (modern-day Augsburg) in the Roman province of Raetia. Via Augusta was completed in 46‚Äì47 AD; the route took its course along the Adige valley to the neighbouring Reschen Pass (west of the Brenner Pass), then descended into the Inn valley before rising to Fern Pass towards Augsburg. The Roman road that physically crossed over the Brenner Pass did not exist until the 2nd century AD. It took the \\"eastern\\" route through the Puster Valley and descended into Veldidena (modern-day Wilten), where it crossed the Inn and into Zirl and arrived at Augsburg via F√ºssen. The Alamanni (Germanic tribe) crossed the Brenner Pass southward into modern-day Italy in 268 AD, but they were stopped in November of that year at the Battle of Lake Benacus. The Romans kept control over the mountain pass until the end of their empire in the 5th century.\\"Geschichte Schwabens bis zum Ausgang des 18. Jahrhunderts\\" by Max Spindler, Christoph Bauer, Andreas Kraus, 3rd edition; publisher: C.H. Beck Verlag 2001, page 80 , = Holy Roman Empire = During the High Middle Ages, Brenner Pass was a part of the important Via Imperii, an imperial road linking the Kingdom of Germany north of the Alps with the Italian March of Verona. In the carolingian Divisio Regnorum of 806 the Brenner region is called per alpes Noricas, the transit through the Noric Alps. Since the 12th century, the Brenner Pass was controlled by the Counts of Tyrol within the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa made frequent uses of the Brenner Pass to cross the Alps during his imperial expeditions into Italy. The 12th-century Brenner Pass was a trackway for mule trains and carts. Modernisation of the Brenner Pass started in 1777, when a carriage road was laid out at the behest of Empress Maria Theresa. = Austrian Empire = Modernisation further took place under the Austrian Empire and the Brenner Railway, which was completed in stages from 1853 to 1867. It became the first trans-Alpine railway without a major tunnel and at high altitude (crossing the Brenner Pass at 1,371 m). Completion of the railway enabled the Austrians to move their troops more efficiently; the Austrians had hoped to secure their territories of Venetia and Lombardy (south of the Alps), but lost them to Italy following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and Austro- Prussian War in 1866. = Recent history = At the end of World War I in 1918, the control of the Brenner Pass became shared between Italy and Austria under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The Treaty of London (1915) secretly awarded Italy the territories south of the Brenner Pass for supporting the Entente Powers. Welschtirol/Trentino, along with the southern part of County of Tyrol (now South Tyrol), was transferred to Italy, and Italian troops occupied Tyrol and arrived at the Brenner Pass in 1919 to 20. German coal entering Italy through the Brenner Pass in the 1930s During World War II, German F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler and Italian Duce Benito Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass to celebrate their Pact of Steel on 18 March 1940. The Brenner Pass was part of the ratlines that were used by some fleeing Nazis after the German surrender in 1945. Motorway The motorway E45 (European designation; in Italy A22, in Austria the A13), Brenner Autobahn/Autostrada del Brennero, begins in Innsbruck, runs through the Brenner Pass, Bozen/Bolzano, Verona and finishes outside Modena. It is one of the most important routes of north‚Äìsouth connections in Europe. After the signing of the Schengen Agreement in 1992 and Austria's subsequent entry into the European Union in 1995, customs and immigration posts at the Brenner Pass were removed in 1997. However, Austria reinstituted border checks in 2015 as a response to the European migrant crisis. In April 2016, Austria announced it would build a 370-meter long fence at the Pass but clarify that \\"it would be used only to \\"channel\\" people and was not a barrier.\\" The Europabr√ºcke (Europe Bridge), located roughly halfway between Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass, is a large concrete bridge carrying the six-lane Brenner Autobahn over the valley of Sill River (Wipptal). At a height of and span of , the bridge was celebrated as a masterpiece of engineering upon its completion in 1963. It is a site where bungee-jumping from the bridge has become a popular tourist attraction. The ever-increasing freight and leisure traffic, however, has been causing long traffic jams at busy times even without border enforcements. The Brenner Pass is the only major mountain pass within the area; other nearby alternatives are footpaths across higher mountains at an altitude of above . As a result, air and noise pollution have generated heavy debate in regional and European politics. , about 1.8 million trucks crossed the Europa Bridge per year.

Gravity, coupled with velocity control, is used to effect the selected deposition of the material. Borrow pits containing suitable material are accessible at an elevation such that the earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles. Hydraulic fill is likely to be the most economic method of construction. Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a dredge pump. In the construction of a hydraulic fill dam, the edges of the dam are defined by low embankments or dykes which are built upward as the fill progresses. The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The sluices discharge their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by discharge control. While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later. Hydraulic fill dams can be dangerous in areas of seismic activity due to the high susceptibility of the uncompacted, cohesion- less soils in them to liquefaction. In these situations, a dam built of compacted soil may be a better choice. Poorly built hydraulic fill dams pose a risk of catastrophic failure. The Fort Peck Dam is an example of a hydraulic fill dam that failed during construction where the hydraulic filling process may have contributed to the failure. The Lower San Fernando Dam is an example of a hydraulic fill dam that failed during an earthquake. Hydraulic fill is also a term used in hard rock mining and describes the placement of finely ground mining wastes into underground stopes in a slurry by boreholes and pipes to stabilize the voids.

Often they reenforce the communication of the ideogram by repeating the first or last syllable in the term. Written English has few logograms, primarily numerals, and therefore few phonetic complements. An example is the nd of 2nd 'second', which avoids ambiguity with 2 standing for the word 'two'. In addition to numerals, other examples include Xmas, Xianity, and Xing for Christmas, Christianity, and Crossing ‚Äì note the separate readings Christ and Cross. In cuneiform In Sumerian, the single word kur had two meanings: 'hill' and 'country'. Akkadian, however, had separate words for these two meanings: ≈°ad√∫ 'hill' and mƒÅtu 'country'. When Sumerian cuneiform was adapted for writing Akkadian, this was ambiguous because both words were written with the same character (conventionally transcribed KUR, after its Sumerian pronunciation). To alert the reader as to which Akkadian word was intended, the phonetic complement -√∫ was written after KUR if hill was intended, so that the characters KUR-√∫ were pronounced ≈°ad√∫, whereas KUR without a phonetic complement was understood to mean mƒÅtu 'country'. Phonetic complements also indicated the Akkadian nominative and genitive cases. Similarly, Hittite cuneiform occasionally uses phonetic complements to attach Hittite case endings to Sumerograms and Akkadograms. Phonetic complements should not be confused with determinatives (which were also used to disambiguate) since determinatives were used specifically to indicate the category of the word they preceded or followed. For example, the sign DINGIR often precedes names of gods, as LUGAL does for kings. It is believed that determinatives were not pronounced. In Japanese As in Akkadian, Japanese borrowed a logographic script, Chinese, designed for a very different language. The Chinese phonetic components built into these kanji do not work when they are pronounced in Japanese, and there is not a one-to-one relationship between them and the Japanese words they represent. For example, the kanji Áîü, pronounced sh≈ç or sei in borrowed Chinese vocabulary, stands for several native Japanese words as well. When these words have inflectional endings (verbs/adjectives and adverbs), the end of the stem is written phonetically: *Áîü nama 'raw' or ki 'alive' *Áîü„ÅÜ [Áîüu] o-u 'expand' *Áîü„Åç„Çã [Áîükiru] i-kiru 'live' *Áîü„Åã„Åô [Áîükasu] i-kasu 'arrange' *Áîü„Åë„Çã [Áîükeru] i-keru 'live' *Áîü„ÇÄ [Áîümu] u-mu 'produce' *Áîü„Åæ„Çå„Çã or Áîü„Çå„Çã [Áîümareru or Áîüreru] u-mareru or uma-reru 'be born' *Áîü„Åà„Çã [Áîüeru] ha-eru 'grow' (intransitive) *Áîü„ÇÑ„Åô [Áîüyasu] ha-yasu 'grow' (transitive) as well as the hybrid Chinese-Japanese word *Áîü„Åò„Çã [Áîüjiru] sh≈ç-jiru 'occur' Note that some of these verbs share a kanji reading (i, u, and ha), and okurigana are conventionally picked to maximize these sharings. These phonetic characters are called okurigana. They are used even when the inflection of the stem can be determined by a following inflectional suffix, so the primary function of okurigana for many kanji is that of a phonetic complement. Generally it is the final syllable containing the inflectional ending is written phonetically. However, in adjectival verbs ending in -shii, and in those verbs ending in -ru in which this syllable drops in derived nouns, the final two syllables are written phonetically. There are also irregularities. For example, the word umareru 'be born' is derived from umu 'to bear, to produce'. As such, it may be written Áîü„Åæ„Çå„Çã [Áîümareru], reflecting its derivation, or Áîü„Çå„Çã [Áîüreru], as with other verbs ending in elidable ru. In Chinese Chinese never developed a system of purely phonetic characters. Instead, about 90% of Chinese characters are compounds of a determinative (called a 'radical'), which may not exist independently, and a phonetic complement indicates the approximate pronunciation of the morpheme. However, the phonetic element is basic, and these might be better thought of as characters used for multiple near homonyms, the identity of which is constrained by the determiner. Due to sound changes over the last several millennia, the phonetic complements are not a reliable guide to pronunciation. In the Maya Script The Maya Script, the logosyllabic orthography of the Maya Civilization, used phonetic complements extensivelyhttp://www.unc.edu/~davidmm/FullComplementspaper.pdf and phonetic complements could be used synharmonically or disharmonically.DISHARMONY IN MAYA HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING: LINGUISTIC CHANGE AND CONTINUITY IN CLASSIC SOCIETY The former is exemplified by the placement of the syllabogram for ma underneath the logogram for \\"Jaguar\\" (in Classic Maya, BALAM): thus, though pronounced \\"BALAM\\", the word for \\"jaguar\\" was spelled \\"BALAM-m(a)\\".

The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers. Functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard in 2013Cisco Systems (2013), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Informational RFC Frequently Asked Questions, retrieved 14 September 2013 and was published with informational status as in 2016. EIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the same autonomous system. Unlike other well known routing protocols, such as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. EIGRP replaced the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) in 1993. One of the major reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.  Overview  Almost all routers contain a routing table that contains rules by which traffic is forwarded in a network. If the router does not contain a valid path to the destination, the traffic is discarded. EIGRP is a dynamic routing protocol by which routers automatically share route information. This eases the workload on a network administrator who does not have to configure changes to the routing table manually. In addition to the routing table, EIGRP uses the following tables to store information: *Neighbor Table: The neighbor table keeps a record of the IP addresses of routers that have a direct physical connection with this router. Routers that are connected to this router indirectly, through another router, are not recorded in this table as they are not considered neighbors. *Topology Table: The topology table stores routes that it has learned from neighbor routing tables. Unlike a routing table, the topology table does not store all routes, but only routes that have been determined by EIGRP. The topology table also records the metrics for each of the listed EIGRP routes, the feasible successor and the successors. Routes in the topology table are marked as \\"passive\\" or \\"active\\". Passive indicates that EIGRP has determined the path for the specific route and has finished processing. Active indicates that EIGRP is still trying to calculate the best path for the specific route. Routes in the topology table are not usable by the router until they are inserted into the routing table. The topology table is never used by the router to forward traffic. Routes in the topology table will not be inserted into the routing table if they are active, are a feasible successor, or have a higher administrative distance than an equivalent path. Information in the topology table may be inserted into the router's routing table and can then be used to forward traffic. If the network changes (for example, a physical link fails or is disconnected), the path will become unavailable. EIGRP is designed to detect these changes and will attempt to find a new path to the destination. The old path that is no longer available is removed from the routing table. Unlike most distance vector routing protocols, EIGRP does not transmit all the data in the router's routing table when a change is made, but will only transmit the changes that have been made since the routing table was last updated. EIGRP does not send its routing table periodically, but will only send routing table data when an actual change has occurred. This behavior is more inline with link-state routing protocols, thus EIGRP is mostly considered a hybrid protocol. When a router running EIGRP is connected to another router also running EIGRP, information is exchanged between the two routers. They form a relationship, known as an adjacency. The entire routing table is exchanged between both routers at this time. After the exchange has completed, only differential changes are sent. EIGRP is often considered a hybrid protocol because it also sends link state updates when link states change.  Features  EIGRP supports the following features: * Support for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and variable length subnet masking. Routes are not summarized at the classful network boundary unless auto summary is enabled. * Support for load balancing on parallel links between sites. * The ability to use different authentication passwords at different times. * MD5 and SHA-2 authentication between two routers. * Sends topology changes, rather than sending the entire routing table when a route is changed. * Periodically checks if a route is available, and propagates routing changes to neighboring routers if any changes have occurred. * Runs separate routing processes for Internet Protocol (IP), IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk, through the use of protocol-dependent modules (PDMs). * Backwards compatibility with the IGRP routing protocols.Introduction to EIGRP.

EIGRP determines the value of the path using five metrics: bandwidth, load, delay, reliability and MTU.Cisco Systems (2012), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Wide Metrics, retrieved 14 March 2014 EIGRP uses Five different messages to communicate with its neighbor routers. EIGRP messages are Hello, Update, Query, Reply, and Acknowledgement. EIGRP routing information exchanged to a router from another router within the same autonomous system has a default administrative distance of 90. EIGRP routing information that has come from an EIGRP-enabled router outside the autonomous system has a default administrative distance of 170.Cisco Systems (2013), What is Administrative Distance?, retrieved 14 September 2013 EIGRP does not operate using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This means that EIGRP does not use a port number to identify traffic. Rather, EIGRP is designed to work on top of layer 3 (i.e. the IP protocol). Since EIGRP does not use TCP for communication, it implements Cisco's Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure that EIGRP router updates are delivered to all neighbors completely.Shamim,Aziz,Liu, Martey 2002, Troubleshooting IP Protocols, Cisco Press USA, accessed 23 November 2013, The reliable transport protocol also contains other mechanisms to maximize efficiency and support multicasting. EIGRP uses 224.0.0.10 as its multicast address and protocol number 88. = Distance vector routing protocol = Cisco Systems now classifies EIGRP as a distance vector routing protocol, but it is normally said to be a hybrid routing protocol.CCIE Practical Studies, Volume I Chapter 11. Hybrid: Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) . InformIT (2008-06-13). Retrieved on 2014-05-30. While EIGRP is an advanced routing protocol that combines many of the features of both link-state and distance-vector routing protocols, EIGRP's DUAL algorithm contains many features which make it more of a distance vector routing protocol than a link-state routing protocol.Ashraf, Muhammad Irfan, et al. \\"Comparative Analysis of Link State and Hybrid Routing Protocols \\" Despite this, EIGRP contains many differences from most other distance-vector routing protocols, including:Albrightson, R., Garcia-Luna-Aceves, J.

Networld/Interop (Vol. 94, pp. 136-147). * the use of explicit hello packets to discover and maintain adjacencies between routers. * the use of a reliable protocol to transport routing updates. * the use of a feasibility condition to select a loop-free path. * the use of diffusing computations to involve the affected part of the network into computing a new shortest path. =EIGRP composite and vector metrics= EIGRP associates six different vector metrics with each route and considers only four of the vector metrics in computing the Composite metric: Router1# show ip eigrp topology 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.255 IP- EIGRP topology entry for 10.0.0.1/32 State is Passive, Query origin flag is 1, 1 Successor(s), FD is 40640000 Routing Descriptor Blocks: 10.0.0.1 (Serial0/0/0), from 10.0.0.1, Send flag is 0x0 Composite metric is (40640000/128256), Route is Internal Vector metric: Minimum bandwidth is 64 Kbit Total delay is 25000 microseconds Reliability is 255/255 Load is 197/255 Minimum MTU is 576 Hop count is 2 ;Bandwidth: Minimum Bandwidth (in kilobits per second) along the path from router to destination network. ;Load: Number in range 1 to 255; 255 being saturated ;Total Delay: Delay, in 10s of microseconds, along the path from router to destination network ;Reliability: Number in range 1 to 255; 255 being the most reliable ;MTU:Minimum path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (never used in the metric calculation) ;Hop Count: Number of routers a packet passes through when routing to a remote network, used to limit the EIGRP AS. EIGRP maintains a hop count for every route, however, the hop count is not used in metric calculation. It is only verified against a predefined maximum on an EIGRP router (by default it is set to 100 and can be changed to any value between 1 and 255). Routes having a hop count higher than the maximum will be advertised as unreachable by an EIGRP router. Routing metric The composite routing metric calculation uses five parameters, so-called K values, K1 through K5. These act as multipliers or modifiers in the composite metric calculation. K1 is not equal to Bandwidth, etc. By default, only total delay and minimum bandwidth are considered when EIGRP is started on a router, but an administrator can enable or disable all the K values as needed to consider the other Vector metrics. For the purposes of comparing routes, these are combined together in a weighted formula to produce a single overall metric: : \\\\bigg [ \\\\bigg ( K_1 \\\\cdot {\\\\text{Bandwidth}}_{E} + \\\\frac{K_2 \\\\cdot {\\\\text{Bandwidth}}_{E}}{256-\\\\text{Load}} + K_3 \\\\cdot {\\\\text{Delay}}_{E} \\\\bigg ) \\\\cdot \\\\frac {K_5}{K_4 + \\\\text{Reliability}} \\\\bigg ] \\\\cdot 256 where the various constants (K_1 through K_5) can be set by the user to produce varying behaviors. An important and unintuitive fact is that if K_5 is set to zero, the term \\\\tfrac {K_5}{K_4 + \\\\text{Reliability}} is not used (i.e. taken as 1). The default is for K_1 and K_3 to be set to 1, and the rest to zero, effectively reducing the above formula to ({\\\\text{Bandwidth}}_{E} + \\\\text{Delay}_{E}) \\\\cdot 256. Obviously, these constants must be set to the same value on all routers in an EIGRP system, or permanent routing loops may result. Cisco routers running EIGRP will not form an EIGRP adjacency and will complain about K-values mismatch until these values are identical on these routers. EIGRP scales the interface Bandwidth and Delay configuration values with following calculations: : {\\\\text{Bandwidth}}_{E} = 107 / Value of the bandwidth interface command : {\\\\text{Delay}}_{E} = Value of the delay interface command On Cisco routers, the interface bandwidth is a configurable static parameter expressed in kilobits per second (setting this only affects metric calculation and not actual line bandwidth). Dividing a value of 107 kbit/s (i.e. 10 Gbit/s) by the interface bandwidth statement value yields a result that is used in the weighted formula. The interface delay is a configurable static parameter expressed in tens of microseconds. EIGRP takes this value directly without scaling into the weighted formula. However, various show commands display the interface delay in microseconds. Therefore, if given a delay value in microseconds, it must first be divided by 10 before using it in the weighted formula. IGRP uses the same basic formula for computing the overall metric, the only difference is that in IGRP, the formula does not contain the scaling factor of 256. In fact, this scaling factor was introduced as a simple means to facilitate backward compatility between EIGRP and IGRP: In IGRP, the overall metric is a 24-bit value while EIGRP uses a 32-bit value to express this metric. By multiplying a 24-bit value with the factor of 256 (effectively bit-shifting it 8 bits to the left), the value is extended into 32 bits, and vice versa. This way, redistributing information between EIGRP and IGRP involves simply dividing or multiplying the metric value by a factor of 256, which is done automatically. =Feasible successor= A feasible successor for a particular destination is a next hop router that is guaranteed not to be a part of a routing loop. This condition is verified by testing the feasibility condition. Thus, every successor is also a feasible successor. However, in most references about EIGRP the term feasible successor is used to denote only those routes which provide a loop- free path but which are not successors (i.e. they do not provide the least distance). From this point of view, for a reachable destination, there is always at least one successor, however, there might not be any feasible successors. A feasible successor provides a working route to the same destination, although with a higher distance. At any time, a router can send a packet to a destination marked \\"Passive\\" through any of its successors or feasible successors without alerting them in the first place, and this packet will be delivered properly. Feasible successors are also recorded in the topology table. The feasible successor effectively provides a backup route in the case that existing successors become unavailable. Also, when performing unequal-cost load-balancing (balancing the network traffic in inverse proportion to the cost of the routes), the feasible successors are used as next hops in the routing table for the load-balanced destination. By default, the total count of successors and feasible successors for a destination stored in the routing table is limited to four. This limit can be changed in the range from 1 to 6. In more recent versions of Cisco IOS (e.g. 12.4), this range is between 1 and 16. =Active and passive state= A destination in the topology table can be marked either as passive or active. A passive state is a state when the router has identified the successor(s) for the destination. The destination changes to active state when the current successor no longer satisfies the feasibility condition and there are no feasible successors identified for that destination (i.e. no backup routes are available). The destination changes back from active to passive when the router received replies to all queries it has sent to its neighbors. Notice that if a successor stops satisfying the feasibility condition but there is at least one feasible successor available, the router will promote a feasible successor with the lowest total distance (the distance as reported by the feasible successor plus the cost of the link to this neighbor) to a new successor and the destination will remain in the passive state. =Feasibility condition= The feasibility condition is a sufficient condition for loop freedom in EIGRP- routed network. It is used to select the successors and feasible successors that are guaranteed to be on a loop-free route to a destination. Its simplified formulation is strikingly simple: :If, for a destination, a neighbor router advertises a distance that is strictly lower than our feasible distance, then this neighbor lies on a loop-free route to this destination. or in other words, :If, for a destination, a neighbor router tells us that it is closer to the destination than we have ever been, then this neighbor lies on a loop-free route to this destination. It is important to realize that this condition is a sufficient, not a necessary, condition. That means that neighbors which satisfy this condition are guaranteed to be on a loop-free path to some destination, however, there may be also other neighbors on a loop-free path which do not satisfy this condition. However, such neighbors do not provide the shortest path to a destination, therefore, not using them does not present any significant impairment of the network functionality. These neighbors will be re-evaluated for possible usage if the router transitions to Active state for that destination. =Unequal Path Cost Load Balancing = EIGRP features load balancing on paths with different costs. A multiplier, called variance, is used to determine which paths to include into load balancing. The variance is set to 1 by default, which means load balancing on equal cost paths. The maximum variance is 128. The minimum metric of a route is multiplied by the variance value. Each path with a metric that is smaller than the result is used in load balancing.How Does Unequal Cost Path Load Balancing (Variance) Work in IGRP and EIGRP Cisco. Retrieved on 2017-03-24 With the functionality of the Unequal Path Cost Load Balancing on EIGRP, OSPF protocol is unable to design the network by Unequal Path Cost Load Balancing. Regarding the Unequal Path Cost Load Balancing function on industry usage, the network design can be flexible with the traffic management.  EIGRP and compatibility to other vendors  Cisco released details of the proprietary EIGRP routing protocol in an RFC in an effort to assist companies whose networks operate in a multi-vendor environment. The protocol is described in . EIGRP was developed 20 years ago, yet it is still one of the primary Cisco routing protocols due to its purported usability and scalability in comparison to other protocols.Cisco Systems (2013), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) Informational RFC Frequently Asked Questions, retrieved 14 September 2013 Cisco has stated that EIGRP is an open standard but they leave out several core details in the RFC definition which makes interoperability hard to setup between different vendors' routers when the protocol is used.

It was headed by the postmaster general. The Postal Service Act, signed by U.S. president George Washington on February 20, 1792, established the department. Postmaster General John McLean, in office from 1823 to 1829, was the first to call it the Post Office Department rather than just the \\"Post Office.\\" The organization received a boost in prestige when President Andrew Jackson invited his postmaster general, William T. Barry, to sit as a member of the Cabinet in 1829. The Post Office Act of 1872 () elevated the Post Office Department to Cabinet status. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), postal services in the Confederate States of America were provided by the Confederate States of America Post-office Department, headed by Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan. The Postal Reorganization Act was signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970. It replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service on July 1, 1971. The regulatory role of the postal services was then transferred to the Postal Regulatory Commission. History =Foundations= In the early years of the North American colonies, many attempts were made to initiate a postal service. These early attempts were of small scale and usually involved a colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony for example, setting up a location in Boston where one could post a letter back home to England. Other attempts focused on a dedicated postal service between two of the larger colonies, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, but the available services remained limited in scope and disjointed for many years. For example, informal independently run postal routes operated in Boston as early as 1639, with a Boston to New York City service starting in 1672. A central postal organization came to the colonies in 1691, when Thomas Neale received a 21-year grant from the British Crown for a North American Postal Service. On February 17, 1691, a grant of letters patent from the joint sovereigns, William III and Mary II, empowered him: > to erect, settle, and establish within the chief parts of their majesties' > colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for receiving and > dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send, and deliver the same > under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and > to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years. The patent included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on official documents of all kinds. The tax was repealed a year later. Neale appointed Andrew Hamilton, Governor of New Jersey, as his deputy postmaster. The first postal service in America commenced in February 1692. Rates of postage were fixed and authorized, and measures were taken to establish a post office in each town in Virginia. Massachusetts and the other colonies soon passed postal laws, and a very imperfect post office system was established. Neale's patent expired in 1710, when Parliament extended the English postal system to the colonies. The chief office was established in New York City, where letters were conveyed by regular packets across the Atlantic. = The American Revolution = Before the Revolution, there was only a trickle of business or governmental correspondence between the colonies. Most of the mail went back and forth to counting houses and government offices in London. The revolution made Philadelphia, the seat of the Continental Congress, the information hub of the new nation. News, new laws, political intelligence, and military orders circulated with a new urgency, and a postal system was necessary. Journalists took the lead, securing post office legislation that allowed them to reach their subscribers at very low cost, and to exchange news from newspapers between the thirteen states. Overthrowing the London-oriented imperial postal service in 1774‚Äì1775, printers enlisted merchants and the new political leadership, and created a new postal system.Joseph M. Adelman, \\"'A Constitutional Conveyance of Intelligence, Public and Private': The Post Office, the Business of Printing, and the American Revolution,\\" Enterprise & Society (2010) 11#4 pp 709‚Äì752. in Project MUSE The United States Post Office (USPO) was created on July 26, 1775, by decree of the Second Continental Congress. Benjamin Franklin headed it briefly. Before the Revolution, individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post. = Post Revolution = First national postal road map, created in 1796 by Assistant Postmaster General Abraham Bradley. The official post office was created in 1792 as the Post Office Department (USPOD). It was based on the Constitutional authority empowering Congress \\"To establish post offices and post roads\\". The 1792 law provided for a greatly expanded postal network, and served editors by charging newspapers an extremely low rate. The law guaranteed the sanctity of personal correspondence, and provided the entire country with low-cost access to information on public affairs, while establishing a right to personal privacy.Richard John, \\"How the Post Office Made America,\\" New York Times Feb 8, 2013 Rufus Easton was appointed by Thomas Jefferson first postmaster of St. Louis under the recommendation of Postmaster General Gideon Granger. Rufus Easton was the first postmaster and built the first post office west of the Mississippi. At the same time Easton was appointed by Thomas Jefferson, judge of Louisiana Territory, the largest territory in North America. Bruce Adamson wrote that: \\"Next to Benjamin Franklin, Rufus Easton was one of the most colorful people in United States Postal History.\\" It was Easton who educated Abraham Lincoln's attorney general, Edward Bates. In 1815 Edward Bates moved into the Easton home and lived there for years at Third and Elm. Today this is the site of the Jefferson Memorial Park. In 1806 Postmaster General Gideon Granger wrote a three-page letter to Easton, begging him not to partake in a duel with vice- president Aaron Burr. Two years earlier it was Burr who had shot and killed Alexander Hamilton. Many years later in 1852, Easton's son, Major-General Langdon Cheves Easton, was commissioned by William T. Sherman, at Fort Union to deliver a letter to Independence, Missouri. Sherman wrote: \\"In the Spring of 1852, General Sherman mentioned that the quartermaster, Major L.C. Easton, at Fort Union, New Mexico, had occasion to send some message east by a certain date, and contracted with Aubrey to carry it to the nearest post office (then Independence, Missouri), making his compensation conditional on the time consumed. He was supplied with a good horse, and an order on the outgoing trains for exchange. Though the whole route was infested with hostile Indians, and not a house on it, Aubrey started alone with his rifle. He was fortunate in meeting several outward-bound trains, and thereby made frequent changes of horses, some four or five, and reached Independence in six days, having hardly rested or slept the whole way.\\"\\"For Which Stand; The Life and Papers of Rufus Easton,\\" by Bruce Campbell Adamson and Professor William Foley; See William T. Sherman's Memoirs To cover long distances, the Post Office used a hub-and- spoke system, with Washington as the hub and chief sorting center. By 1869, with 27,000 local post offices to deal with, it had changed to sorting mail en route in specialized railroad mail cars, called Railway Post Offices, or RPOs. The system of postal money orders began in 1864. Free mail delivery began in the larger cities in 1863.Leonard D. White, The Republican Era: A study in administrative history: 1869‚Äì1901 (1963), p 259 =19th century= rightThe postal system played a crucial role in national expansion. It facilitated expansion into the West by creating an inexpensive, fast, convenient communication system. Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide assistance, assisted entrepreneurs in finding business opportunities, and made possible regular commercial relationships between merchants in the west and wholesalers and factories back east. The postal service likewise assisted the army in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the New York Weekly Tribune, facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped integrate established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.William H. Bergmann, \\"Delivering a Nation through the Mail,\\" Ohio Valley History (2008) 8#3 pp 1‚Äì18. The Post Office in the 19th century was a major source of federal patronage. Local postmasterships were rewards for local politicians‚Äîoften the editors of party newspapers. About three quarters of all federal civilian employees worked for the Post Office. In 1816 it employed 3,341 men, and in 1841, 14,290. The volume of mail expanded much faster than the population, as it carried annually 100 letters and 200 newspapers per 1,000 white population in 1790, and 2,900 letters and 2,700 newspapers per thousand in 1840.Richard John, Spreading the News (1995) pp 3‚Äì4 The Post Office Department was enlarged during the tenure of President Andrew Jackson. As the Post Office expanded, difficulties were experienced due to a lack of employees and transportation. The Post Office's employees at that time were still subject to the so-called \\"spoils\\" system, where faithful political supporters of the executive branch were appointed to positions in the post office and other government corporations as a reward for their patronage. These appointees rarely had prior experience in postal service and mail delivery. This system of political patronage was replaced in 1883, after passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. In 1823, ten years after the Post Office had first begun to use steamboats to carry mail between post towns where no roads existed, waterways were declared post roads. Once it became clear that the postal system in the United States needed to expand across the entire country, the use of the railroad to transport the mail was instituted in 1832, on one line in Pennsylvania. All railroads in the United States were designated as post routes, after passage of the Act of July 7, 1838. Mail service by railroad increased rapidly thereafter.History of the United States Postal Service 1775‚Äì1993, p. 1 ~ Benjamin Franklin ~ George Washington ~The First U.S. Postage StampsIssued 1847The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of Congress and approved on March 3, 1847. The earliest known use of the Franklin 5¬¢ is July 7, 1847, while the earliest known use of the Washington 10¬¢ is July 2, 1847. These issues were declared invalid for postage on July 1, 1851.Scotts US Postage Stamp Catalogue An Act of Congress provided for the issuance of stamps on March 3, 1847, and the postmaster general immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson. The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. The 5-cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than and traveling less than 300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles, or twice the weight deliverable for the 5-cent stamp. In 1847, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company acquired the contract which allowed it to carry the U.S. mails from New York, with stops in New Orleans and Havana, to the Isthmus of Panama for delivery in California. The same year, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had acquired the right to transport mail under contract from the United States Government from the Isthmus of Panama to California. In 1855, William Henry Aspinwall completed the Panama Railway, providing rail service across the Isthmus and cutting to three weeks the transport time for the mails, passengers and goods to California. This remained an important route until the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. Railroad companies greatly expanded mail transport service after 1862, and the Railway Mail Service was inaugurated in 1869. Rail cars designed to sort and distribute mail while rolling were soon introduced. RMS employees sorted mail \\"on-the-fly\\" during the journey, and became some of the most skilled workers in the postal service. An RMS sorter had to be able to separate the mail quickly into compartments based on its final destination, before the first destination arrived, and work at the rate of 600 pieces of mail an hour. They were tested regularly for speed and accuracy. Parcel Post service began with the introduction of International Parcel Post between the U.S. and foreign countries in 1887.The New York Times. \\"The Parcel Post System\\". 24 April 1887 That same year, the U.S. Post Office and the postmaster general of Canada established parcel-post service between the two nations. A bilateral parcel-post treaty between the independent (at the time) Kingdom of Hawaii and the USA was signed on 19 December 1888 and put into effect early in 1889. Parcel-post service between the U.S. and other countries grew with the signing of successive postal conventions and treaties. While the Post Office agreed to deliver parcels sent into the country under the UPU treaty, it did not institute a domestic parcel-post service for another twenty-five years. =20th century= The advent of Rural Free Delivery (RFD) in the U.S. in 1896, and the inauguration of a domestic parcel post service by Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock in 1913, greatly increased the volume of mail shipped nationwide, and motivated the development of more efficient postal transportation systems. Many rural customers took advantage of inexpensive Parcel Post rates to order goods and products from businesses located hundreds of miles away in distant cities for delivery by mail. From the 1910s to the 1960s, many college students and others used parcel post to mail home dirty laundry, as doing so was less expensive than washing the clothes themselves. After four-year-old Charlotte May Pierstorff was mailed from her parents to her grandparents in Idaho in 1914, mailing of people was prohibited. In 1917, the Post Office imposed a maximum daily mailable limit of two hundred pounds per customer per day after a business entrepreneur, W. H. Coltharp, used inexpensive parcel-post rates to ship more than eighty thousand masonry bricks some four hundred seven miles via horse-drawn wagon and train for the construction of a bank building in Vernal, Utah. The advent of parcel post also led to the growth of mail order businesses that substantially increased rural access to modern goods over what was typically stocked in local general stores. One of the largest organizations of the early 20th century, the Post Office Department is reported to have had nearly 350,000 employees in 1924. United States Postal Savings System Mineral Wells, Texas, post office, built between 1911 and 1913 In 1912, carrier service was announced for establishment in towns of second and third class with $100,000 appropriated by Congress. From January 1, 1911, until July 1, 1967, the United States Post Office Department operated the United States Postal Savings System. An Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, established the Postal Savings System in designated post offices, effective January 1, 1911. The legislation aimed to get money out of hiding, attract the savings of immigrants accustomed to the postal savings system in their native countries, provide safe depositories for people who had lost confidence in banks, and furnish more convenient depositories for working people. The law establishing the system directed the Post Office Department to redeposit most of the money in the system in local banks, where it earned 2.5 percent interest. The system paid 2% interest per year on deposits. The half-percent difference in interest was intended to pay for the operation of the system. Certificates were issued to depositors as proof of their deposit. Depositors in the system were initially limited to hold a balance of $500, but this was raised to $1,000 in 1916 and to $2,500 in 1918. The initial minimum deposit was $1. In order to save smaller amounts for deposit, customers could purchase a 10-cent postal savings card and 10-cent postal savings stamps to fill it. The card could be used to open or add to an account when its value, together with any attached stamps, amounted to one or more dollars, or it could be redeemed for cash. At its peak in 1947, the system held almost $3.4 billion in deposits, with more than four million depositors using 8,141 postal units. Airmail On August 12, 1918, the Post Office Department took over airmail service from the United States Army Air Service (USAAS). Assistant Postmaster General Otto Praeger, appointed Benjamin B. Lipsner to head the civilian-operated Air Mail Service. One of Lipsner's first acts was to hire four pilots, each with at least 1,000 hours' flying experience, paying them an average of $4,000 per year ($ today). The Post Office Department used new Standard JR-1B biplanes specially modified to carry the mail while the war was still in progress, but following the war operated mostly World War I surplus military de Havilland DH-4 aircraft. During 1918, the Post Office hired an additional 36 pilots. In its first year of operation, the Post Office completed 1,208 airmail flights with 90 forced landings. Of those, 53 were due to weather and 37 to engine failure. By 1920, the Air Mail service had delivered 49 million letters. Domestic air mail became obsolete in 1975, and international air mail in 1995, when the USPS began transporting First-Class mail by air on a routine basis. The Post Office was one of the first government departments to regulate obscene materials on a national basis. When the U.S. Congress passed the Comstock laws of 1873, it became illegal to send through the U.S. mail any material considered obscene or indecent, or which promoted abortion issues, birth control, or alcohol consumption. Gold shipments to Fort Knox Mail truck loaded with gold leaves the New York City Assay Office, 1941. The Post Office oversaw the shipment of gold from the New York City Assay office and Philadelphia Mint to the newly constructed bullion depository at Fort Knox. The first wave of gold shipments were made semi-weekly between January 11 and June 17, 1937. The gold was transported from the New York Assay office and the Phildephia Mint onto trains using postal trucks and municipal police escorts. In the armored train cars, postal workers were accompanied by soldiers, secret service agents, and mint guards. Decoy trains were employed. The gold was transferred from the train onto Army trucks under the protection of soldiers armed with armor piercing bullets and machine guns. The trucks were escorted by combat cars of the 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment to the depository. The Post Office Department billed the Treasury Department for transporting the weight of the crates and gold using the fourth class postage rate with added insurance fees. A total of were moved to Fort Knox in this wave. It took over 5 months and required 39 trains consisting of 215 cars. On March 5, 1941, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced the completion of another shipment totaling of gold from the New York Assay office to the depository. This shipment began in July of the previous year. It took seven months and required 45 trains consisting of 337 cars. U.S. Postal Strike of 1970 On March 18, 1970, postal workers in New York City‚Äîupset over low wages and poor working conditions, and emboldened by the Civil Rights Movement‚Äîorganized a strike against the United States government. The strike initially involved postal workers in only New York City, but it eventually gained support of over 210,000 United States Post Office Department workers across the nation. While the strike ended without any concessions from the Federal government, it did ultimately allow for postal worker unions and the government to negotiate a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, as well as the signing of the Postal Reorganization Act by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970. The Act replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with a new federal agency, the United States Postal Service, and took effect on July 1, 1971.

It belongs to the district of Riviera- Pays-d'Enhaut in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland and has a population of approximately 26,433, and about 85,000 in the agglomeration Vevey-Montreux as 2019. History Lake Geneva from Montreux The earliest settlement was a Late Bronze Age village at Baugy. Montreux lies on the north east shore of Lake Geneva at the fork in the Roman road from Italy over the Simplon Pass, where the roads to the Roman capital of Aventicum and the road into Gaul through Besan√ßon separated. This made it an important settlement in the Roman era. A Roman villa from the 2nd-4th centuries and a 6th‚Äì7th century cemetery have been discovered. In the 12th century, viticulture was introduced to the region, and the sunny slopes of the lake from Lavaux to Montreux became an important wine-growing region. Montreux is first mentioned in 1215 as Mustruel. In 1295, the Bishop of Sion sold the parish of Montreux to Girard of Oron. In 1317, it was split between the Lords of Oron (Le Ch√¢telard) and the Counts of Savoy (Les Planches). A Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit administered estates and a hospital in Montreux starting in about 1309. The region was subject to various princes, most notably the princes of Savoy from the south side of the lake. They unified the territory which comprises the present canton of Vaud and were generally popular sovereigns. After the Burgundian Wars in the 15th century, the Swiss in Bern occupied the region without resistance, an indication of the weakness of the princes of Savoy. Under Bernese rule (1536‚Äì1798) it belonged to the Bailiwick of Chillon (renamed in 1735 into the Bailiwick of Vevey). The Reformation made the region around Montreux and Vevey an attractive haven for Huguenots from Italy, who brought their artisanal skills and set up workshops and businesses. The abbey of Les Echarpes blanches was founded in 1626. In 1798, Napoleon liberated the region from the Bernese. In the 19th century, the tourist industry became a major commercial outlet, with the grand hotels of Montreux attracting the rich and cultured from Europe and America. Starting in the 19th century there were three independent municipalities that shared a central authority. This county council was made up of four deputies from Le Ch√¢telard, two from Les Planches and one from Veytaux. The church, the market hall of La Rouvenaz, the secondary school (the building was from 1872 and 1897) and the slaughter-house (1912) were all owned by the county council. Each municipality had its own taxes and a mayor. In 1962, the municipalities of Le Ch√¢telard and Les Planches merged, while Veytaux remained independent.

Culture  Montreux was a haven for Catherine Barkley and Lt. Frederic Henry in Ernest Hemingway's classic, A Farewell to Arms. Montreux hosts several festivals: *The Septembre musical de Montreux, founded in 1946 and held every year since then. *Freddie Celebration Days - Montreux Celebration is organising this major and entirely free event in Montreux around September 5th, the birthday of Freddie Mercury, late singer of the band Queen. *The Montreux Jazz Festival, annually in July since 1967. It is held at the Montreux Convention Centre, built in 1973 and has become a global phenomenon. *The Golden Rose Festival, annually in spring (1961‚Äì2003), which awarded the Golden Rose of Montreux, an international award for television. *The Golden Award of Montreux, annually in April, is traditionally, since 1989, the first international advertising and multimedia Competition in Europe - starting the global season for awarding creative excellence. Montreux has a walking trail along the lake, stretching from Villeneuve to Vevey. The main square of the town, Place du March√©, features a statue of Freddie Mercury facing Lake Geneva. Some of the numerous small villages around Montreux include La Tour-de-Peilz, Clarens, Territet, and Villeneuve. The Ch√¢teau of Chillon has views over Lake of Geneva and can be accessed via bus, train, walk or boat. Deep Purple travelled to Montreux in December 1971 to record Machine Head. The band's song \\"Smoke on the Water\\" tells of the events of December 1971, when a Frank Zappa fan with a flare gun set the Montreux Casino on fire, destroying the casino where they had originally planned to record the album. Thanks to Claude Nobs who eventually arranged alternate locations, the Grand Hotel was where the album was created and recorded, except for Smoke on the Water which was recorded at La Petit Palais on Rue du Lac. Deep Purple again returned in 1973 to record Burn. The Montreux Casino was reopened in 1975 and later a monument commemorating Deep Purple and their song Smoke on the Water can be found next to the casino. The Dubliners's song \\"Montreux Monto\\" on their album Live at Montreux was recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1976. View of Montreux town from Montreux railway station Montreux is the home of Mountain Studios, the recording studio used by several artists. \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" by Led Zeppelin is named after the city where the drums session of John Bonham was recorded in 1976. In 1978, the band Queen bought the studio. It was then sold to Queen producer David Richards. In 2002, the Mountain Studios was converted into a bar as part of a complete renovation of the studio. David Richards has left Montreux to settle down somewhere else. Queen also appeared in 1984 and in 1986 at the Golden Rose Festival and Queen guitarist Brian May appeared in 2001 at the Jazz Festival. Montreux was also the subject of the 1995 Queen single \\"A Winter's Tale\\" on the album Made in Heaven, one of Freddie's last songs before his death on November 24, 1991. The album cover features the statue of Mercury beside the lake. In 1990, the Wakker Prize for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage was awarded to Montreux.Swiss Heritage Society, Wakker Prize accessed 9 May 2009 The F√©d√©ration Internationale de Roller Sports was founded in Montreux in 1924.

In February 2005, 117 of the 190 member countries of the Universal Postal Union had postal code systems. Although postal codes are usually assigned to geographical areas, special codes are sometimes assigned to individual addresses or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, such as government agencies and large commercial companies. One example is the French CEDEX system.  Terms  There are a number of synonyms for postal code; some are country- specific. * CAP: The standard term in Italy; CAP is an acronym for codice di avviamento postale (postal expedition code). * CEP: The standard term in Brazil; CEP is an acronym for c√≥digo de endere√ßamento postal (postal addressing code). * Eircode: The standard term in Ireland. * NPA in French- speaking Switzerland (num√©ro postal d'acheminement) and Italian-speaking Switzerland (numero postale di avviamento). * PIN: The standard term in India; PIN is an acronym for Postal Index Number. Sometimes redundantly called a PIN code. * PLZ: The standard term in Germany, Austria, German-speaking Switzerland and Liechtenstein; PLZ is an abbreviation of Postleitzahl (postal routing number). * Postal code: The general term is used in Canada. * Postcode: This solid compound is popular in many English-speaking countries and is also the standard term in the Netherlands. *PSƒå: The standard term in Slovakia and Czech Republic; PSƒå is an acronym for Po≈°tov√© smerovacie ƒç√≠slo (in Slovak) or Po≈°tovn√≠ smƒõrovac√≠ ƒç√≠slo (in Czech), both meaning postal routing number. * ZIP code: The standard term in the United States and the Philippines; ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan.  History  1977 Soviet stamp promoting the use of postal codes The development of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of postal delivery as populations grew and the built environment became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district numbers (or postal zone numbers) within large cities. London was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857 (EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW) and Liverpool in 1864. By World War I, such postal district or zone numbers existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least as early as the 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of \\"Boston 9, Mass\\" in 1920 are attested,) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented USPOD-wide) until World War II. By 1930 or earlier the idea of extending postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \\"ZIP codes\\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \\"ZIP\\". Modern postal codes were first introduced in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1932, but the system was abandoned in 1939. The next country to introduce postal codes was Germany in 1941, followed by Singapore in 1950, Argentina in 1958, the United States in 1963 and Switzerland in 1964. The United Kingdom began introducing its current system in Norwich in 1959, but they were not used nationwide until 1974. = Criticism from the 2010s = Open Data Index of postal codes. Green are country-level databases with open access, red are commercial and non-open. The classic postal codes of the 1970s are not fine-grained, can't be used as location (converted to approximated latitude/longitude of the address). But modern digital maps can generate geocodes (e.g. Geohash), it can be used as a finer location code with the same number of digits, and without administrative cost. Classical postcodes are administrated by a central authority: this control can be used to obtain profits when data is not opened. By 2016, according to ODI (Open Data Index is an Open Knowledge Foundation's project), only 8% of postal codes were opened.  Presentation  Postal codes by country and digit-type. Numeric digits: Alphanumeric digits: Postal codes not in use: = Character sets = The characters used in postal codes are * The Arabic numerals \\"0\\" to \\"9\\" * Letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet * Spaces, hyphens  Reserved characters  Postal codes in the Netherlands originally did not use the letters 'F', 'I', 'O', 'Q', 'U' and 'Y' for technical reasons. But as almost all existing combinations are now used, these letters were allowed for new locations starting 2005. The letter combinations \\"SS\\" (Schutzstaffel), \\"SD\\"(Sicherheitsdienst), and \\"SA\\" (Sturmabteilung) are not used for historical reasons. Postal codes in Canada do not include the letters D, F, I, O, Q, or U, as the optical character recognition (OCR) equipment used in automated sorting could easily confuse them with other letters and digits. The letters W and Z are used, but are not currently used as the first letter. The Canadian Postal Codes use alternate letters and numbers (with a space after the 3rd character) in this format: A9A 9A9 In Ireland the eircode system uses the following letters only: A, C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y. This serves two purposes: * to avoid confusion in OCR, and * it also helps to avoid accidental double-entendres by avoiding the creation of word look-alikes, as Eircode's last four characters are random.  Alphanumeric postal codes  Most of the postal code systems are numeric; only a few are alphanumeric (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given the same number of characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a two digit numeric code can represent 100 locations, a two character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations. The independent nations using alphanumeric postal code systems are: * Argentina (see table) * Brunei (see table) * Canada (see table) * Eswatini * Ireland (see table) * Jamaica (see table) (suspended in 2007) * Kazakhstan (since 2015) * Malta (see table) * Netherlands (see table) * Peru (see table) The postal code format in Peru was updated in February 2011 to be of the format of five digits. * Somalia * United Kingdom (see table) Countries which prefix their postal codes with a fixed group of letters, indicating a country code, include Andorra, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Ecuador and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. = Country code prefixes = ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes were recommended by the European Committee for Standardization as well as the Universal Postal Union to be used in conjunction with postal codes starting in 1994, but they have not become widely used. Andorra, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Ecuador, Latvia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines use the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 as a prefix in their postal codes. In some countries (such as in continental Europe, where a numeric postcode format of four or five digits is commonly used) the numeric postal code is sometimes prefixed with a country code when sending international mail to that country. = Placement of the code = Postal services have their own formats and placement rules for postal codes. In most English-speaking countries, the postal code forms the last item of the address, following the city or town name, whereas in most continental European countries it precedes the name of the city or town. When it follows the city it may be on the same line or on a new line. In Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan it is written at the beginning of an address.  Geographic coverage  Postal codes are usually assigned to geographical areas. Sometimes codes are assigned to individual addresses or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, e.g. government agencies or large commercial companies. One example is the French Cedex system. = Postal zone numbers = Before postal codes as described here were used, large cities were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually numbered from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with London postal district numbers, for example. Ireland still uses postal district numbers in Dublin. In New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch were divided into postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and have now become redundant as a result of a new postcode system being introduced. = Codes defined along administrative borders = Some postal code systems, like those of Ecuador and Costa Rica, show an exact agreement with the hierarchy of administrative country subdivisions. Format of six digit numeric (eight digit alphanumeric) postal codes in Ecuador, introduced in December 2007: ECAABBCC : EC - ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code : AA - one of the 24 provinces of Ecuador (24 of 100 possible codes used = 24%) : BB - one of the 226 cantons of Ecuador (for AABB 226 of 10000 codes used, i.e. 2.26%. Three cantons are not in any province) : CC - one of the parishes of Ecuador. Format of five digit numeric Postal codes in Costa Rica, introduced in 2007: ABBCC : A - one of the seven provinces of Costa Rica (7 of 10 used, i.e. 70%) : BB - one of the 81 cantons of Costa Rica (81 of 100 used, i.e. 81%) : CC - one of the districts of Costa Rica. In Costa Rica these codes were originally used as district identifiers by the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Costa Rica and the Administrative Territorial Division, and continue to be equivalent. The first two digits of the postal codes in Turkey correspond to the provinces and each province has assigned only one number. They are the same for them as in ISO 3166-2:TR.http://www.postakodumne.com Posta Kodum Ne - Postal Code Reference for Turkey The first two digits of the postal codes in Vietnam indicate a province. Some provinces have one, other have several two digit numbers assigned. The numbers differ from the number used in ISO 3166-2:VN. = Codes defined close to administrative boundaries = S√£o Paulo state. Each color shows a set of administrative areas, and the hierarchy of codes relating indirectly to them. In France the numeric code for the departments is used as the first two digits of the postal code, except for the two departments in Corsica that have codes 2A and 2B and use 20 as postal code. Furthermore, the codes are only the codes for the department in charge of delivery of the post, so it can be that a location in one department has a postal code starting with the number of a neighbouring department. = Codes defined indirectly to administrative borders = The first digit of the postal codes in the United States defines an area including several states. From the first three digits (with some exceptions), one can deduce the state. Similarly, in Canada, the first letter indicates the province or territory, although the provinces of Quebec and Ontario are divided into several lettered sub-regions (e.g. H for Montreal and Laval), and the Northwest Territories and Nunavut share the letter X. = Codes defined independently from administrative areas = The first two digits of the postal codes in Germany define areas independently of administrative regions. The coding space of the first digit is fully used (0-9); that of the first two combined is utilized to 89%, i.e. there are 89 postal zones defined. Zone 11 is non-geographic. Royal Mail designed the postal codes in the United Kingdom mostly for efficient distribution. Nevertheless, people associated codes with certain areas, leading to some people wanting or not wanting to have a certain code. See also postcode lottery. In Brazil the 8-digit postcodes are an evolution of the five-digit area postal codes. In the 1990s the Brazilian five-digit postal code (illustrated), \`DDDDD\`, received a three-digit suffix \`DDDDD-SSS\`, but this suffix is not directly related to the administrative district hierarchy. The suffix was created only for logistic reasons. QuadrasExemplo-CEP.pngCity blocks surrounded by streets, some streets with a different eight-digit postal code (suffixes 001 to 899). QuadraExemplo-CEP.pngFaces of a city block and their extension into its interior. Each color is an eight-digit postal code, usually assigned to a side (odd or even numbered) of a street. QuadraFaces- CEP.pngFaces of a city block and their extension between city blocks. The same colors (polygons) indicate the same postal codes. code spatialization it is an error to associate the postal code to an individual land lot area: a lot may have 0, 1, 2 or more delivery points, with different codes. The postal code assignment can be assigned to individual land lots in some special cases  in Brazil they are named \\"large receivers\\" and receive suffixes 900-959. In any other case it is an error to associate the postal code with the whole land lot area (illustrated). A postal code is often related to a land lot, but this is not always the case. Postal codes are usually related to access points on streets. Small or middle-sized houses, in general, only have a single main gate which is the delivery point. Parks, large businesses such as shopping centers, and big houses, may have more than one entrance and more than one delivery point. So the semantic of an address and its postal code can vary, and one land lot may have more than one postal code. = Precision =  Czechoslovakia  Czechoslovakia introduced Postal Routing Numbers (PSƒå - po≈°tovn√≠ smƒõrovac√≠ ƒç√≠sla) in 1973. The code consists of 5 digits formatted into two groups: NNN NN. Originally, the first group marked a district transport centre, the second group represented the order of post offices on the collection route. In the first group, the first digit corresponds partly with the region, the second digit meant a collection transport node (sbƒõrn√Ω p≈ôepravn√≠ uzel, SPU) and the third digit a \\"district transport node\\" (okresn√≠ p≈ôepravn√≠ uzel). However, processing was later centralized and mechanized while codes remained the same. After separation Slovakia and the Czech Republic kept the system. Codes with an initial digit of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 are used in the Czech Republic, while codes with an initial digit of 8, 9, or 0 are used in Slovakia A code corresponds to a local postal office. However, some larger companies or organizations have their own post codes. In 2004‚Äì2006 there were some efforts in Slovakia to reform the system, to get separate post codes for every district of single postmen, but the change was not realized. India Postal codes are known as Postal Index Numbers (PINs; sometimes redundantly as PIN codes) in India. The PIN system was introduced on 15 August 1972 by India Post. India uses a unique six-digit code as a geographical number to identify locations in India. The format of the PIN is ZSDPPP defined as follows: : Z ‚Äî Zone : S ‚Äî Sub-zone : D ‚Äî Sorting District : PPP ‚Äî Post Office There are nine total zones consisting of eight regional zones and a functional zone which are represented by the first digit.  Ireland  In Ireland, the new postal code system launched in 2015, known as Eircode provides a unique code for each individual address. These 7-character alphanumerical codes are in the format: A99 XXXX While it is not intended to replace addresses, in theory simply providing a seven-character Eircode would locate any Irish delivery address. For example, the Irish Parliament D√°il √âireann is: D02 A272 The first three digits are the routing key, which is a postal district and the last four characters are a unique identifier which relates to an individual address (business, house or apartment). A fully developed API is also available for integrating the Eircode database into business database and logistics systems.  Netherlands  Postal codes in the Netherlands, known as postcodes, are alphanumeric, consisting of four digits followed by a space and two letters (NNNN AA). Adding the house number to the postcode will identify the address, making the street name and town name redundant. For example: 2597 GV 75 will direct a postal delivery to Theo Mann-Bouwmeesterlaan 75, 's‚ÄëGravenhage (the International School of The Hague).  Singapore  Since 1 September 1995, every building in Singapore has been given a unique, six-digit postal code.  United Kingdom  For domestic properties, an individual postcode may cover up to 100 properties in contiguous proximity (e.g. a short section of a populous road, or a group of less populous neighbouring roads). The postcode together with the number or name of a property is not always unique, particularly in rural areas. For example, GL20 8NX/1 might refer to either 1 Frampton Cottages or 1 Frampton Farm Cottages, roughly a quarter of a mile (400 metres) apart. The structure is alphanumeric, with the following six valid formats, as defined by BS 7666: A9 9AA A9A 9AA A99 9AA AA9 9AA AA9A 9AA AA99 9AA There are always two halves: the separation between outward and inward postcodes is indicated by one space. The outward postcode covers a unique area and has two parts which may in total be two, three or four characters in length. A postcode area of one or two letters, followed by one or two numbers, followed in some parts of London by a letter. The outward postcode and the leading numeric of the inward postcode in combination forms a postal sector, and this usually corresponds to a couple of thousand properties. Larger businesses and isolated properties such as farms may have a unique postcode. Extremely large organisations such as larger government offices or bank headquarters may have multiple postcodes for different departments. There are about 100 postcode areas, ranging widely in size from BT which covers the whole of Northern Ireland to WC for a small part of Central London. Postcode areas occasionally cross national boundaries, such as SY which covers a large, predominantly rural area from Shrewsbury and Ludlow in Shropshire, England, through to the seaside town of Aberystwyth, Ceredigion on Wales' west coast.  United States  In the United States, the basic ZIP Code is composed of five numbers. The first three numbers identify a specific sectional center facility‚Äîor central sorting facility‚Äîthat serves a geographic region (typically a large part of a state). The next two numbers identify either an area of a city (if in an urban area) or a village/town (if in a suburban/rural area). There is an extended format of the ZIP Code known as the ZIP+4, which contains the basic five-digit ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four additional digits. These digits identify a specific delivery route, such as one side of a building, a group of apartments, or several floors of a large office building. Although using the ZIP+4 offers higher accuracy, addressing redundancy, and sorting efficiency within the USPS, it is optional and not widely used by the general public. It is primarily only used by business mailers. For high volume business mailers using automated mailing machines, the USPS has promulgated the Intelligent Mail barcode standard, which is a barcode containing the ZIP+4 code plus a two digit delivery point. This 11-digit number is theoretically a unique identifier for every address in the country. = States and overseas territories sharing a postal code system = French overseas departments and territories use the five-digit French postal code system, each code starting with the three-digit department identifier. Monaco is also integrated in the French system and has no system of its own. The British Crown dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are part of the UK postcode system. They use the schemes AAN NAA and AANN NAA, in which the first two letters are a unique code (GY, JE and IM respectively). Most of the Overseas Territories have UK-style postcodes, with a single postcode for each territory or dependency, although they are still treated as international destinations by Royal Mail in the UK, and charged at international rather than UK inland rates. The four other Overseas Territories Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands have their own separate systems and formats. The Pacific island states of Palau, Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia remain part of the US ZIP code system, despite having become independent states. San Marino and the Vatican City are part of the Italian postcode system, while Liechtenstein similarly uses the Swiss system, as do the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia and the German exclave of B√ºsingen am Hochrhein, although they also form part of their respective countries' postal code systems. The Czech Republic and Slovakia still uses the codes of the former Czechoslovakia, their ranges not overlapping. In 2004‚Äì2006, Slovakia prepared a reform of the system but the plan was postponed and maybe abandoned. In Czechia, there was no significant effort to modify the system.  Non-geographic codes  In the United Kingdom, the non-conforming postal code GIR 0AA was used for the National Girobank until its closure in 2003.40 facts about the postcode to mark 40th anniversary as vital part of daily life , Daily Mirror, 26 August 2014 A non-geographic series of postcodes, starting with BX, is used by some banks and government departments. :HM Revenue and Customs - VAT Controller :VAT Central Unit :BX5 5AT A fictional address is also used by Royal Mail for letters to Santa Claus, more commonly known as Santa or Father Christmas: :Santa‚Äôs Grotto :Reindeerland XM4 5HQWho answers all the letters sent to Father Christmas? , Daily Telegraph, 5 December 2013 Previously, the postcode SAN TA1 was used.Santa: 'I'm not a Superman, but I do exist' , BBC News Online, 11 December 2002 In Finland the special postal code 99999 is for Korvatunturi, the place where Santa Claus (Joulupukki in Finnish) is said to live, although mail is delivered to the Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi.Not For Parents Travel Book, Lonely Planet, 2012, page 84 In Canada the amount of mail sent to Santa Claus increased every Christmas, up to the point that Canada Post decided to start an official Santa Claus letter- response program in 1983. Approximately one million letters come in to Santa Claus each Christmas, including from outside of Canada, and all of them are answered in the same languages in which they are written. Canada Post introduced a special address for mail to Santa Claus, complete with its own postal code: :SANTA CLAUS :NORTH POLE H0H 0H0 In Belgium bpost sends a small present to children who have written a letter to Sinterklaas. They can use the non-geographic postal code 0612, which refers to the date Sinterklaas is celebrated (6 December), although a fictional town, street and house number are also used. In Dutch, the address is :Sinterklaas :Spanjestraat 1 :0612 Hemel This translates as \\"1 Spain Street, 0612 Heaven\\". In French, the street is called \\"Paradise Street\\": :Saint-Nicolas :Rue du Paradis 1 :0612 Ciel  Formats   Non-postal uses and economic aspects  While postal codes were introduced to expedite the delivery of mail, they are very useful tools for several other purposes, particularly in countries where codes are very fine- grained and identify just a few addresses. Among uses are: * Finding the nearest branch of an organisation to a given address. A computer program uses the postal codes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance as the crow flies (or, if used in conjunction with street map software, road distance). This can be used by companies to inform potential customers where to go, by job centres to find jobs for job- seekers, to alert people of town planning applications in their area, and a great many other applications. * Fine-grained postal codes can be used with satellite navigation systems to navigate to an address by street number and postcode. * Geographical sales territories for representatives in the pharmaceutical industry are allocated based on a workload index that is based upon postcode. = Availability = The availability of postal code information has significant economic advantages. In some countries, the postal authorities charge for access to the code database. , the United Kingdom Government is consulting on whether to waive licensing fees for some geographical data sets (to be determined) related to UK postcodes.

Introduced in 1963, the basic format consisted of five digits. In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the USPS, but its registration expired in 1997. History =Early history and five-digit ZIP Codes= A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign featuring Mr. ZIP thumb Swingin' Six video used by the post office to promote the ZIP code The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district/zone numbers. The United States Post Office Department (USPOD) implemented postal zones for many large cities in 1943. For example: > Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \\"16\\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized.\\"State Abbreviations\\", USPS.com . An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters. According to Publication 59, the two-letter standard was \\"based on a maximum 23-position line, because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems\\", which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation, such as \\"Sacramento, Calif.\\" along with the ZIP Code. The abbreviations have remained unchanged, with the exception of Nebraska, which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration, to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector.Bullamore, Tim (2001). Robert Moon Obituary. Retrieved from https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-moon-729034.html . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code, which describe the sectional center facility (SCF) or \\"sec center\\". An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits. The fourth and fifth digits, which give a more precise locale within the SCF, were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn, Sr. The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes. The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning. Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public (although the building may include a post office that is open to the public), and most of their employees work the night shift. Items of mail picked up at post offices are sent to their own SCFs in the afternoon, where the mail is sorted overnight. In the case of large cities, the last two digits as assigned generally coincided with the older postal zone number. For example: > Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis, MN55416 In 1967, these became mandatory for second- and third-class bulk mailers, and the system was soon adopted generally. The United States Post Office used a cartoon character, which it called Mr. ZIP, to promote the use of the ZIP Code. He was often depicted with a legend such as \\"USE ZIP CODE\\" in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps. Mr. ZIP was featured prominently alongside musical group \\"The Swingin' Six\\" in a variety show that the post office used to explain the importance of using ZIP codes. In 1971, Elmira (NY) Star-Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a ZIP Code on its envelopes. Herb Klein, special assistant to President Nixon, responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the ZIP Code. =ZIP+4= In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called \\"plus-four codes\\", \\"add-on codes\\", or \\"add-ons\\". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus- four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address‚Äîalong with the even more specific delivery point‚Äîand sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits‚Äînine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point. For Post Office Boxes, the general (but not invariable) rule is that each box has its own ZIP+4 code. The add-on code is often one of the following: the last four digits of the box number (e.g. PO Box 107050, Albany, NY 12201-7050), zero plus the last three digits of the box number (e.g., PO Box 17727, Eagle River, AK 99577-0727), or, if the box number consists of fewer than four digits, enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four-digit number (e.g., PO Box 77, Juneau, AK 99750-0077). However, there is no uniform rule, so the ZIP+4 Code must be looked up individually for each box (e.g. using the USPS's official ZIP Code Lookup tool, and being sure to enter just city and state, not the 5-digit ZIP). =Postal bar code= The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort. A barcode can be printed by the sender (some word-processing programs such as WordPerfect include the feature), but this is not recommended, as the address-to-ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date. It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece. In general, the post office uses OCR technology, though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address. Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail. This requires more than just a simple font; mailing lists must be standardized with up-to-date Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS)-certified software that adds and verifies a full, correct ZIP+4 Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point. Furthermore, mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11-digit code with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this. These steps are usually done with PAVE- certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags. The assignment of delivery point digits (the 10th and 11th digits) is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12-digit number. The delivery-point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address. The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide. However, when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C, often CASS will assign the same 12-digit number to two distinct mail delivery points. The last digit is always a check digit, which is obtained by summing all 5, 9 or 11 digits, taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum (i.e., the remainder after dividing by 10) and finally subtracting this from 10. (Thus, the check digit for 10001-0001 00 would be 7, since 1+1+1=3, 3‚â°3(mod 10) and 10‚Äì3=7.) Structure and allocation =Scope and international mail= ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States (and its territories). There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries, except for the independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a Compact of Free Association. Another exception is ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of USA armed forces. Mail to U.S. diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington, D.C. The four-digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number, while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word \\"Place\\" to form a street name. Each mission uses a ZIP+4 Code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number. For example, the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India would be: > Embassy of the United States of America 9000 New Delhi Place Washington, > DC20521-9000 However, individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number. The Zip Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above. While delivered through the pouch system, mail to such addresses are not considered \\"Diplomatic Pouch\\" materials, and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country. An example address is: > JOHN ADAMS UNIT 8400 BOX 0000 DPO AE09498-0048 =By type and use= There are four types of ZIP Codes: * Unique: assigned to a single high-volume address * Post Office Box-only: used only for PO Boxes at a given facility, not for any other type of delivery * Military: used to route mail for the U.S. military * Standard: all other ZIP Codes. Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies, universities, businesses, or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes. Government examples include 20505 for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington, D.C.; 81009 for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in Pueblo, Colorado. Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of Walmart (72716). An example of a PO Box-only ZIP Code is 22313, which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in Alexandria, Virginia, such as those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the area surrounding that post office, home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314, which is thus a Standard ZIP Code. In certain exceptional cases, a nominally Standard-type ZIP Code may, in practice, be used as one of the three other types. For example, the ZIP Code 43210 in Columbus, Ohio is listed as a Standard-type ZIP Code. However, since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the Ohio State University's main campus, it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a \\"Unique\\"-type ZIP Code. =By geography= Primary state prefixes ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states, the second and third digits together representing a region in that group (or perhaps a large city) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region; afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order. Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell, which spans Christian County, Kentucky, and Montgomery County, Tennessee, and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County, Oregon, and Modoc County, California. In general, the first three digits designate a sectional center facility, the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional center facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal, Kansas; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup, New Mexico; and 961 in California to Reno, Nevada. In terms of geographic location, many of the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with '0', are in the New England region. Also in the '0' region are New Jersey (non-contiguous with the remainder of the '0' area), Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and APO/FPO military addresses for personnel stationed in Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code is in Holtsville, New York (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service center there). Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for Adjuntas, Puerto Rico; 01001 for Agawam, Massachusetts, and the ZIP Codes 01002 and 01003 for Amherst, Massachusetts; 01002 is used for mail in town, while 01003 is reserved for the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Until 2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 (located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire) and were used by the Diversity Immigrant Visa program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens. The numbers increase southward along the East Coast, such as 02115 (Boston), 10001 (New York City), 19103 (Philadelphia), 21201 (Baltimore), 20008 (Washington, D.C.), 30303 (Atlanta), and 33130 (Miami) (these are only examples, as each of these cities contains several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the Mississippi River, southward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the West Coast. For example, 40202 is in Louisville, 50309 in Des Moines, 60601 in Chicago, 63101 in St. Louis, 77036 in Houston, 80202 in Denver, 94111 in San Francisco, 98101 in Seattle, and 99950 in Ketchikan, Alaska (the highest ZIP Code). ZIP Code zones in the United States The first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows: * 0 = Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA), Maine (ME), New Hampshire (NH), New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY, Fishers Island only), Puerto Rico (PR), Rhode Island (RI), Vermont (VT), Virgin Islands (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE) * 1 = Delaware (DE), New York (NY), Pennsylvania (PA) * 2 = District of Columbia (DC), Maryland (MD), North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC), Virginia (VA), West Virginia (WV) * 3 = Alabama (AL), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Mississippi (MS), Tennessee (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA) * 4 = Indiana (IN), Kentucky (KY), Michigan (MI), Ohio (OH) * 5 = Iowa (IA), Minnesota (MN), Montana (MT), North Dakota (ND), South Dakota (SD), Wisconsin (WI) * 6 = Illinois (IL), Kansas (KS), Missouri (MO), Nebraska (NE) * 7 = Arkansas (AR), Louisiana (LA), Oklahoma (OK), Texas (TX) * 8 = Arizona (AZ), Colorado (CO), Idaho (ID), New Mexico (NM), Nevada (NV), Utah (UT), Wyoming (WY) * 9 = Alaska (AK), American Samoa (AS), California (CA), Guam (GU), Hawaii (HI), Marshall Islands (MH), Federated States of Micronesia (FM), Northern Mariana Islands (MP), Oregon (OR), Palau (PW), Washington (WA), Army Post Office Pacific (APO AP), Fleet Post Office Pacific (FPO AP) Secondary regional prefixes (123xx) and local ZIP Codes (12345) Early advertisement for ZIP Code 10005 The second and third digits represent the sectional center facility (SCF) (e.g. 477xx = Vanderburgh County, Indiana), and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city (if in a metropolitan area), or a village/town (outside metro areas), e.g. 47722 (4=Indiana, 77=Vanderburgh County, 22=University of Evansville area). When a sectional center facility's area crosses state lines, that facility is assigned separate three-digit prefixes for the states that it serves. In some urban areas, like 462 for Marion County, Indiana, the three-digit prefix will often exist in one county, while, in rural and most suburban areas, the prefix will exist in multiple counties; for example, the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties: Gibson, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh, and Warrick. In some cases, an urban county may have more than one prefix. This is the case with Allen (467, 468), Lake (464, 463), St. Joseph (465, 466), and Vanderburgh (476, 477) counties. Cities like Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York City have multiple prefixes within their city limits. In some cases, these may be served from the same SCF, such as in San Diego County, California, where the three-digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities, and 921 for the city of San Diego itself, although all three are processed through the same SCF facility. Despite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence, ZIP Code \\"areas\\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes (rural route areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near Haubstadt, Indiana, which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring Fort Branch, Indiana, while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639. Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes, often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation. Almost all U.S. government agencies in and around the capital are assigned ZIP Codes starting with 20200 to 20599, which are Washington, D.C., ZIP Codes, even if they are not located in Washington itself. While the White House itself is located in ZIP Code 20006, it has the ZIP Code 20500. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is located in Rockville, Maryland, at ZIP Code 20852, but has been assigned by the Postal Service the address \\"Washington, DC 20555\\". In similar manner, the ZIP Code for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, a federally chartered independent authority, is 20001‚Äì6000, even though the physical address of the Authority's office, \\"1 Aviation Circle\\", is in Arlington, Virginia. One current exception to this rule is the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). When the USPTO was located in the Crystal City neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia, it was assigned by the Postal Service the address \\"Washington, DC 20231\\" despite being physically located in ZIP Code 22202. However, the USPTO now uses ZIP Codes assigned to its current locations in Alexandria, Virginia. The patents side of the USPTO uses a PO box assigned the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1450 for all postal communications. The trademarks side of the USPTO uses the same ZIP+4 code for most of its mail, but the office of the Commissioner for Trademarks has its own PO box with the ZIP+4 code of 22313‚Äì1451, and some offices within that part of the USPTO use the 22314 ZIP Code. In rare circumstances, a locality is assigned a ZIP Code that does not match the rest of the state. In even rarer cases a ZIP Code may cross state lines. Usually, this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state. Examples: * Fishers Island, New York, bears the ZIP Code 06390 and is served from Connecticut because the only ferry service is to Connecticut ‚Äì all other New York ZIP Codes (excepting those at Holtsville for the IRS) begin with \\"1\\". * Returned government parcels from Washington, D.C. are sent to ZIP Codes beginning with \\"569\\" so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility (this was put into place after the 2001 anthrax attacks). * Some Arkansas roads north of Bull Shoals Lake can best be accessed by the Protem, Missouri, delivery unit (ZIP Code 65733), as they are accessible by road only through Missouri. * Fort Campbell (ZIP Code 42223), is primarily in Tennessee, but the main entrance is in Kentucky. * The Kentucky Bend geographical anomaly in far western Kentucky, where a small portion of land is separated from the rest of the state by a bend in the Mississippi river, shares ZIP Code 38079 with Tiptonville, Tennessee. Preferred place names: ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines A ZIP Code's address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city. The Postal Service designates one preferred place name for each ZIP Code. This may be an incorporated town or city, a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated census-designated place, or a small unincorporated community. Additional place names may be recognized as acceptable for a certain ZIP Code. Still, others are deemed not acceptable, and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery. Preferred place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located. However, for many cities that have incorporated since ZIP Codes were introduced, the city name is not the preferred place name. Many databases automatically assign the preferred place name for a ZIP Code, without regard to any acceptable place names. For example, Centennial, Colorado is divided among seven ZIP Codes assigned to Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton as its preferred place names; none of these seven ZIP Codes carries \\"Centennial\\" as a preferred name, and in the ZIP Code directory, Centennial addresses are listed under those three cities. Since it is acceptable to write \\"Centennial\\" in conjunction with any of the seven ZIP Codes, one can write \\"Centennial\\" in an address in Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton, as long as it is in one of the shared ZIP Codes. Acceptable place names are usually added to a ZIP Code in cases where the ZIP Code boundaries divide them between two or more cities, as in the case of Centennial. However, in many cases, only the preferred name can be used, even when many addresses in the ZIP Code are in another city. People sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city. One extreme example is ZIP Code 85254; it was assigned the place name Scottsdale, Arizona because it is served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring Phoenix. Another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles known as Beverly Hills Post Office. Naturally, its residents prefer the more glamorous Beverly Hills address and 90210 ZIP Code, but this regularly causes problems with emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills. Similarly, Missouri City, Texas, straddles Harris and Fort Bend counties. The portion within Harris County is within the ZIP Code 77071, which must use the city name of Houston instead of Missouri City. At the same time, a small portion of the city of Houston is in Fort Bend County in the ZIP Code 77489, and residents there must use the name Missouri City for their address even though they are in Houston. This also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices. For example, while most of the town of Plainfield, Massachusetts is in ZIP Code 01070, some sections of town are in the ZIP Code area for the neighboring town of Cummington with ZIP Code 01026. Only the preferred name of Cummington is allowed in ZIP Code 01026, so residents of parts of Plainfield must list their address as being in Cummington. This phenomenon is repeated across the country. The previously mentioned Englewood, Colorado is an inner-ring suburb that was built out by the 1960s. Its post office served the area that is now the high-growth southern tier of the Denver metropolitan area, and ZIP Codes in this area were assigned Englewood as their preferred place name. A business community as large as downtown Denver has grown in this area, with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations. These companies indicate Englewood as their location (the preferred postal place name), although they are located in other cities. As a result, there are really two Englewoods ‚Äì the city, small and with a largely working-class residential population, and, a number of miles away, the postal Englewood, a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of Englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of ZIP Codes. People who say they live or work in Englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city. In Indiana, the ZIP Code for a town usually indicates the ZIP Code for its corresponding township, as nearly all of Indiana's small town post offices have rural routes. Acceptable place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular urban center than their own municipality. For example, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, has 130 distinct municipalities, yet many of the county's residents, and even some residents of adjacent counties, commonly use Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as their postal address. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in some urban areas, neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing, such as La Jolla, California, which is the preferred place name for ZIP Code 92037, despite the fact that La Jolla is a district of San Diego, California and not a separate legal entity. This ZIP Code is also in the 919/920 sequence used by San Diego County's suburban and rural areas, not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the City of San Diego, even though La Jolla has always been part of San Diego. Many ZIP Codes are for villages, census-designated places, portions of cities, or other entities that are not municipalities. For example, ZIP Code 03750 is for Etna, New Hampshire, but Etna is not a city or town; it is a village district in the town of Hanover, which itself is assigned the ZIP Code 03755. Another example is ZIP Code 08043, which corresponds to the census-designated place of Kirkwood, New Jersey, but serves the entirety of Voorhees Township. This is also the case in LaGrange, New York, a portion of which is served by the 12603 ZIP Code based in the neighboring town of Poughkeepsie. The rest of LaGrange is served by the LaGrangeville Post Office. LaGrangeville is itself not a town at all, but a section of LaGrange. Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, served by the 19090 ZIP Code, is a village that straddles the border of Upper Moreland Township and Abington Township, and that post office also serves a small portion of Upper Dublin Township. Furthermore, non-municipal place names may also share ZIP Codes with municipal place names. For example, West Windsor Township, New Jersey, is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as Princeton Junction, a census-designated place within West Windsor. Silver Spring, Maryland, (20815, 20901‚Äì20912) is neither a city nor a town, but simply the common name for an unincorporated area consisting of a large part of the lower southern portion of Montgomery County. Postal designations for place names become de facto locations for their addresses, and as a result, it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the preferred place name associated with their ZIP Codes. Because of issues of confusion and lack of identity, some cities, such as Signal Hill, California, (an enclave located entirely inside the separate city of Long Beach) have successfully petitioned the Postal Service to change ZIP Code boundaries or create new ZIP Codes so their cities become the preferred place name for addresses within the ZIP Code. Postal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerations. Sometimes local officials in a community that is not the preferred place name for a ZIP Code but is an acceptable place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community, because if the census estimate of that town's population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population. A typical example is Paddock Lake, Wisconsin, whose preferred place name is Salem. Paddock Lake is incorporated as a village within the town of Salem, even though there are more people in the village of Paddock Lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of Salem. Further confusion is caused because Silver Lake, Wisconsin, which is also a village in the town of Salem and is of similar size and status to Paddock Lake, has its own ZIP Code and post office. In another case, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied a radio station (now WNNX FM) a move requiring a change in its city of license to Sandy Springs, Georgia, largely because it was not a city (until municipal incorporation in late 2005), despite being the seventh- largest place in the state by population. The FCC cited the use of \\"Atlanta\\" on letters of support from local organizations, even though the USPS forced them to use Atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect. Currently \\"Sandy Springs\\" is only acceptable, despite none of 30328 being in Atlanta, or anywhere else outside the Sandy Springs city limit. This even applies to the ZIP Code used only for PO boxes at the Sandy Springs main post office. Because ZIP Codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines, problems may occur where street addresses are based on quadrant location within a county. For example, the area served by 30339 straddles the Cobb County‚ÄìFulton County line in Georgia. The Cobb County portion of this area includes Vinings in the southeast of that county; the Fulton County portion lies within the city limits of Atlanta. Every street address in Vinings is labeled SE, and has a house number on the Cobb County grid (according to the distance from the town square in the county seat of Marietta). However, because the USPS demands the use of Atlanta, Vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast Atlanta, instead of in the opposite (northwest metro Atlanta) side. Division and reallocation of ZIP Codes Like area codes, ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed, especially when a rural area becomes suburban. Typically, the new codes become effective once announced, and a grace period (e.g., one year) is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents, order new stationery, etc. In rapidly growing communities, it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new sectional center facility was opened at Dulles Airport in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve Montgomery County, Maryland, no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because Silver Spring (whose postal area includes Wheaton) has its own prefix, 209, there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility. On the other hand, depopulation may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated. For example, Centralia, Pennsylvania's ZIP Code, 17927, was retired in 2002, and ZIP Codes for Onoville (14764), Quaker Bridge (14771) and Red House (14773) in New York were prevented from going into use in 1964 in preparation for the Kinzua Dam's completion. Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, was originally issued the 19117 ZIP Code, although it lies in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Because of the 191 prefix, which is found only in Philadelphia apart from that lone exception, auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to residents of that suburban location. For that reason, residents petitioned the USPS for a 190-prefix ZIP Code, which is common to the inner-ring Pennsylvania suburbs of that city, and, after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the USPS, Elkins Park was finally reassigned to the 19027 ZIP Code. ZIP Codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned. For example, concurrent with the above-noted change in Montgomery County, Maryland, and under pressure from the then-mayor of Washington, D.C., Marion Barry, the USPS realigned the postal boundaries between Washington, D.C. and Maryland to match the boundary. Previously, many inner suburbs, such as Bethesda and Takoma Park, Oxon Hill, Temple Hills, Suitland, and Capitol Heights had been in the Washington, D.C., postal area. As a result of the change, ZIP Codes in Maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new ZIP Codes beginning with 207, 208, or 209, depending on their location, and ZIP Codes straddling the D.C.‚ÄìMaryland line were split. For example, 20016 (Bethesda) became 20816, while the Maryland portion of 20012 (Takoma Park) became 20912.  Other uses  = Delivery services = Delivery services other than the USPS, such as FedEx, United Parcel Service, and DHL, require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package. = Statistics = , there are 41,702 ZIP Codes in the United States. ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the latitude and longitude of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data. The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for ZIP Codes, but does not keep up-to-date datasets of all ZCTAs. Complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available. ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or point-based data, as they are assigned only at the point of delivery, not for the spaces in between the delivery points. The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons, or areal features representing the approximate extent of the ZIP Code to use for mapping and data presentation. ZCTAs are not to be confused with ZIP Codes, and they are not updated as frequently as ZIP Codes. However, for many research and planning purposes, they are very useful and can be used with ZIP Code data. = Marketing = The data is often used in direct mail marketing campaigns in a process called ZIP-code marketing. Point-of-sale cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes. Besides providing purchasing-pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments, retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer's full address and telephone number. ZIP-Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk, an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as redlining. This can cause problems, e.g., expensive insurance, for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code, while they live in a relatively crime-free town. (See Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, above.) California outlawed this practice in 2011. = Legislative districts = ZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts. Although the website of the United States House of Representatives has a \\"Find Your Representative\\" feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone, it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code. This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts. One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan gerrymandering calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting. = Internet = A 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for routing. ZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / store locator software on many websites, especially brick-and-click websites. This software processes a user-input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States. Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized. ZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary (or desirable) but the user's municipality or general location is needed. Examples (in addition to the store locator example listed above) include weather forecasts, television listings, local news, and online dating (most general-purpose sites, by default, search within a specified radius of a given ZIP Code, based on other users' entered ZIP Codes). = Credit card security = ZIP Codes are used in credit card authorization, specifically Address Verification System (AVS). When a merchant collects the entire address, the ZIP Code is an important part of AVS. In some cases, the ZIP Code is the only thing used for AVS, specifically where collecting a signature, or other information is infeasible, such as pay at the pump or vending machines.  See also  * J.

Biography =The soldier= Lussu during World War I. Lussu was born in Armungia, province of Cagliari (Sardinia) and graduated with a degree in law in 1914. Lussu married Joyce Salvadori, a notable poet, and member of the noble Paleotti family of the Marche, who were counts of Fermo. Prior to the entry of Italy into World War I, Lussu joined the army and was involved in several skirmishes. As a complementary officer of the Sassari Infantry Brigade in 1916 he was stationed on the Asiago Plateau. The brigade had arrived on the plateau in May 1916 to help in the Italian effort to stop the Austrian Spring offensive. In the month of June 1916 the brigade conquered Monte Fior, Monte Castelgomberto, Monte Spil, Monte Miela and Monte Zebio. After the war Lussu wrote the book A Year on the High Plateau (Un anno sull'altipiano) about his experiences of trench warfare on the Plateau. The 1970 movie Many Wars Ago (\\"Uomini contro\\") by Francesco Rosi is taken from this book. =Politics and exile= After the war Lussu, together with Camillo Bellieni, founded the Partidu Sardu-Partito Sardo d'Azione (The Sardinian Action Party), that blended social-democratic ideas and Sardinian nationalism. The party took a formal position in 1921, opposing the increasing power of the Fascist movement. Lussu was elected to the Italian parliament in 1921 and, in 1924 was among the Aventine secessionists who withdrew from the Italian Parliament after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti. Lussu's anti-Fascist position was, at the time, one of the most radical in Italy. Lussu was physically attacked and injured by unknown aggressors several times. In 1926, during one of these attacks (notably, the same day that Benito Mussolini suffered an attack in Bologna), Lussu shot one of the squadristi, in self-defense. He was arrested and tried; and was acquitted. However, he was re-tried by an administrative Fascist commission and sentenced to 5 years of confinement on the island of Lipari, near Sicily. In 1929 Lussu escaped from his confinement and reached Paris. There, together with Gaetano Salvemini and Carlo Rosselli he formed Giustizia e Libert√† (Justice and Freedom), an anti- Fascist movement that proposed revolutionary methods to upset the Italian Fascist Regime. While in exile came to be known as \\"Mister Mills\\". In 1938 Lussu's novel Un anno sull'altipiano (\\"A Year on the Plateau\\"), was published in Paris. This thinly fictional account tells of the lives of soldiers during World War I and the trench warfare they encountered. Un anno sull'altipiano underlines, with chill rationalism, how the irrationalities of warfare affected the common man. Gifted with a keen sense of observation and sharp logic, Lussu demonstrates how distant the real life of soldiers is from everyday activities. In a notable passage, he describes the silent terror in the moments preceding an attack, as he is forced to abandon the \\"safe\\" protective trench for an external unknown, risky, undefined world: ‚ÄúAll the machine-guns are waiting for us‚Äù. =Return to Italy= Lussu took part in the civil war in Spain. Between 1941 and 1942 he was the protagonist of the most important \\"episode\\" of the collaboration between British Special Operations Executive and Italian antifascism in exile. He tried to get the clearance for an antifascist uprising in Sardinia, which the SOE supported at some stage but did not receive approval from the Foreign Office.Mireno Berrettini, La Gran Bretagna e l'Antifascismo italiano. Diplomazia clandestina, Intelligence, Operazioni Speciali (1940‚Äì1943), Firenze, 2010 He returned to Italy after the armistice of 1943 when joined the Resistenza and became the secretary of Partito d'Azione for southern Italy. He became the leader of the left wing of Partito d'Azione and later joined forces with the Italian Socialist Party. After World War II he served as a Minister of Aid in the government of Ferruccio Parri and later as a minor minister in Alcide De Gasperi's government. In 1964 he separated from the Socialist Party creating the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP). Ideological differences with the political line of Partito d'Azione deepened and Lussu left Sardinia. Emilio Lussu died in Rome in 1975. Works Many political meanings have been drawn from Lussu's works, but his works are perhaps more important at a personal level. Morally and philosophically, Lussu's books reflect his need to repent, having been previously an interventista (favourable to entering the war) and a revolutionary (in Giustizia e Libert√†); his works soberly describe what war, in its cruellest moments, was like for him. The alteration of Lussu's opinion of war is quite apparent in the range of his works: first an interventista, then the author of a manual for revolution, soon afterwards the author of a pacifist book, then again a revolutionary and a volunteer in the Spanish civil war. Anyway, A Year on the High Plateau combines well the repulse of the war with the bravery of the fighter.Giulio Angioni, Emilio Lussu e i sardi, in Il dito alzato, Sellerio, 2012 Lussu's consistency has been questioned and politics often invades evaluations of his works. =Bibliography= *La catena (1929) *Marcia su Roma e dintorni (The March on Rome and Thereabouts, 1932) *Teoria dell'insurrezione (\\"Theory of Insurrection\\", 1936) *Per l'Italia dall'esilio (Road to exile: the story of a Sardinian patriot, 1938) (Review in Time Magazine) *Un anno sull'altipiano (\\"A Year on the High Plateau\\", Sassari Infantry Brigade, 1938, ; \\"A Soldier on the Southern Front\\", ) *Diplomazia clandestina\\" (1955) *La clericalizzazione dello Stato e l'arcivescovo di Cagliari (1958) *Il cinghiale del diavolo e altri scritti sulla Sardegna (1976) In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Lussu is played by Giovanni Brusatori.

Located in the center of the an-Nafud desert, on the eastern part of the Najd plateau, the city sits at an average of above sea level, and receives more than 16 million tourists each year, making it the 2nd most visited city in the Arab world. Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi Arabia, 2nd most populous in the Arab world (after Cairo), and 38th most populous in Asia. The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an early Arab chronicler. In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring Manfuha, settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city, and the best known source of the name Riyadh is from this period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas. In 1744, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah, Muhammad bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as the First Saudi State, came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second Saudi State in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman‚ÄìRashidi alliance. Finally, in the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud, known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz. After this he named his kingdom Saudi Arabia in September 1932 with Riyadh as the capital. Riyadh is the political and administrative centre of Saudi Arabia. The Consultative Assembly (also known as the Shura or Shura Council), the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia, the King and the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia are all situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies that form the core of the legal system of Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of other major and minor governmental bodies are also located in Riyadh. The city hosts 112 foreign embassies, most of which are located in the as-Safarat district or Diplomatic Quarter () in the western reaches of the city. RIyadh also holds great economic significance, as it hosts the headquarters of many banks and major companies, such as the National Commercial Bank (NCB), Alinma Bank and the Saudi Arabian British Bank (SABB). Highway 65, known locally as the King Fahd Road, runs through some of these important centers in the city, including the King Abdullah Financial District, one of the world's largest financial districts, the Faisaliyah Center and the Kingdom Center. Riyadh is one of the world's fastest-growing cities in population and is home to many expatriates. Riyadh has been designated a global city. The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, which are overseen by the Municipality of Riyadh () headed by the mayor; and the Royal Commission for Riyadh which is chaired by the Governor of the Province, Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud. As of July 2020, The mayor is Faisal bin Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Ayyaf Al-Muqrin. Most of the population of the Riyadh Province is concentrated around Riyadh, as the rest of the province is mostly desert, with few, small cities connected by small two- to four-lane highways, such as Wadi ad-Dawasir. History =Early history= During the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site of modern Riyadh was called Hajr (), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa. Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al-Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al-Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveler Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as \\"the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr\\". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to the Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj. Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring Manfuha, took control of Riyadh. Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the various oasis town in the area, making them effectively a single city. The name \\"Riyadh,\\" meaning \\"gardens\\" refers to these earlier oasis towns. =First Saudi State= 1922 map of Riyadh In 1744, Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab formed an alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud, the ruler of the nearby town of Diriyah. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of Riyadh led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from Al Kharj, Al Ahsa, and the Banu Yam clan of Najran. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and Riyadh capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the First Saudi State, with Diriyah as its capital. The First Saudi State was destroyed by forces sent by Muhammad Ali of Egypt, acting on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman forces razed the Saudi capital Diriyah in 1818. They had maintained a garrison at Najd. This marked the decline of the House of Saud for a short time. Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad became the first Amir of the Second Saudi State; the cousin of Saud bin Saud, he ruled for 19 years till 1834, leading to the consolidation of the area though they were notionally under the control of the Muhammad Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt. In 1823, Turki ibn Abdallah chose Riyadh as the new capital. Following the assassination of Turki in 1834, his eldest son Faisal killed the assassin and took control, and refused to be controlled by the Viceroy of Egypt. Najd was then invaded and Faisal taken captive and held in Cairo. However, as Egypt became independent of the Ottoman Empire, Faisal escaped after five years of incarceration, returned to Najd and resumed his reign, ruled till 1865, and consolidated the reign of House of Saud. Following the death of Faisal, there was rivalry among his sons which situation was exploited by Muhammad bin Rashid who took most of Najd, signed a treaty with the Ottomans and also captured Hasa in 1871. In 1889, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, the third son of Faisal again regained control over Najd and ruled till 1891, whereafter the control was regained by Muhammad bin Raschid. Internecine struggles between Turki's grandsons led to the fall of the Second Saudi State in 1891 at the hand of the rival Al Rashid clan, which ruled from the northern city of Ha'il. The al-Masmak fort dates from that period. Abdul Rahman bin Faisal al-Saud had sought refuge among a tribal community on the outskirts of Najd and then went to Kuwait with his family and stayed in exile. However, his son Abdul Aziz retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926, and further expanded his kingdom to cover \\"most of the Arabian Peninsula.\\" He named his kingdom as Saudi Arabia in September 1932 with Riyadh as the capital. King Abdul Aziz died in 1953 and his son Saud took control as per the established succession rule of father to son from the time Muhammad bin Saud had established the Saud rule in 1744. However, this established line of succession was broken when King Saud was succeeded by his brother King Faisal in 1964. In 1975, Faisal was succeeded by his brother King Khalid. In 1982, King Fahd took the reins from his brother. This new line of succession is among the sons of King Abdul Aziz who has 35 sons; this large family of Ibn Saud hold all key positions in the large kingdom. =Modern history= From the 1940s, Riyadh mushroomed from a relatively narrow, spatially isolated town into a spacious metropolis. When King Saud came to power, he made it his objective to modernize Riyadh, and began developing Annasriyyah, the royal residential district, in 1950. Following the example of American cities, new settlements and entire neighbourhoods were created on grid plans, and connected by high-capacity main roads to the inner areas. The grid pattern in the city was introduced in 1953. The population growth of the town from 1974 to 1992 averaged 8.2 percent per year. The mayor is Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz. Bin Abdulaziz was appointed in 2019 by royal decree and succeeds Tariq bin Abdul Aziz Al-Faris. Riyadh is now the administrative, and to a great extent the commercial hub of the Kingdom. According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, most large companies in the country establish either sole headquarters or a large office in the city. For this reason, there has been a significant growth in high rise developments in all areas of the city. Most notable among these is King Abdullah Financial District which is fast becoming the key business hub in the city. Riyadh also has the largest all-female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University. According to the Global Financial Centres Index, Riyadh ranked at 77 in 2016‚Äì2017. Though the rank moved up to 69 in 2018, diversification in the economy of the capital is required in order to avoid what the World Bank called a \\"looming poverty crisis\\" brought on by lingering low oil prices and rich state benefits. Since 2017, Riyadh has been the target of missiles from Yemen. In March 2018, one person died as a result of a missile attack. The number of missiles which targeted Riyadh are a small portion of the dozens of missiles fired from Yemen at Saudi Arabia due to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In April 2018, heavy gunfire was heard in Khozama; this led to rumors of a coup attempt. {style=\\"margin:0 auto;\\" Panoramic night view of Riyadh from Kingdom Centre }  Geography  = Climate = Riyadh has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen Climate Classification BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The average high temperature in August is . The city experiences very little precipitation, especially in summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have dust storms during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under . On 1 and 2 April 2015, a massive dust storm hit Riyadh, causing suspension of classes in many schools in the area and cancellation of hundreds of flights, both domestic and international. =City districts= Satellite image of Riyadh King Fahd Road Riyadh is divided into fourteen branch municipalities, in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al- Shemaysi, Irqah, Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal (\\"the North\\"). Olaya District is the commercial heart of the city, with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom Centre, Al Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The centre of the city, Al-Bathaa and Al-Deerah, is also its oldest part. Some of the main districts of Riyadh are: * Al-Bat'ha  Al-Deerah (old Riyadh)  Mi'kal  Manfuha  Manfuha Al-Jadidah (ŸÖŸÜŸÅŸàÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ© ‚Äì \\"new Manfuha\\")  Al-'Oud  Al-Mansorah  Al-Margab  Salam  Jabrah  Al- Yamamah  'Otayyigah * Al-'Olayya & Sulaymaniyyah  Al-'Olayya  Al- Sulaymaniyyah  Al Izdihar  King Fahd District  Al-Masif  Al-Murooj  Al-Mugharrazat  Al-Wurood * Nemar  Nemar  Dharat Nemar  Tuwaiq  Hazm  Deerab * Irqah  Irqah  Al-Khozama * Diplomatic Quarter * Al-Shemaysi  Al-Shemaysi  Eleyshah  Syah  Al-Nasriyyah  Umm Sleym  Al-Ma'athar  Umm Al-Hamam (East) * Al-Ma'athar  Al-Olayya  Al-Nakheel  King Saud University main campus  Umm Al-Hamam (East)  Umm Al-Hamam (West)  Al- Ma'athar Al-Shimali (\\"North Ma'athar\\")  Al-Rahmaniyya  Al-Muhammadiyya  Al-Ra'id * Al-Ha'ir  Al-Ha'ir  Al-Ghannamiyyah  Uraydh * Al-'Aziziyyah  Ad Dar Al Baida  Taybah  Al Mansouriyah * Al-Malaz  Al-Malaz  Al- Rabwah  Al-Rayyan  Jarir  Al-Murabba' * Al-Shifa  Al-Masani'  Al- Shifa  Al-Mansuriyya  Al-Marwah * Al-Urayja  Al-Urayja  Al-Urayja Al- Wusta (\\"Mid-Urayja\\")  Al-Urayja (West)  Shubra  Dharat Laban  Hijrat Laban  As-Suwaidi  As-Suwaidi (West)  Al-Badi'a  Dahrat Al-Badi'a  Sultanah * Al-Shemal  Al-Malga  Al-Sahafa  Hittin  Al-Wadi  Al- Ghadir  Al-Nafil  Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University main campus  Al- Qayrawan  Al-Aqiq  Al-Arid * Al-Naseem  Al-Naseem (East)  Al-Naseem (West)  As-Salam  Al-Manar  Al-Rimayah  Al-Nadheem * Al-Rawdhah  Al- Rawdhah  Al-Qadisiyah  Al-M'aizliyyah  Al-Nahdhah  Gharnatah (Granada)  Qortubah (Cordoba)  Al-Andalus (Andalusia)  Al-Hamra  Al-Qouds * Al- Selayy  Al-Selayy  Ad Difa'  Al Iskan  Khashm Al-'Aan  Al-Sa'adah  Al-Fayha  Al-Manakh * King Abdullah Financial District Demographics The city had a population of 40,000 inhabitants in 1935 and 83,000 in 1949. The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over seven million, according to the most recent sources. As of 2017, the population of Riyadh is composed of 64.19% Saudis, while non-Saudis account for 35.81% of the population. Indians are the largest minority population at 13.7%, followed by Pakistanis at 12.4%. Landmarks and architecture =Vernacular architecture of Old Riyadh= The old town of Riyadh within the city walls did not exceed an area of 1 km2, and therefore very few significant architectural remnants of the original walled oasis town of Riyadh exist today. The most prominent is the Masmak fort and some parts of the original wall structure with its gate which have been restored and reconstructed. There are also a number of traditional mud-brick houses within these old limits, but they are for the most part dilapidated. Expansion outside the city walls was slow to begin with, although there were some smaller oases and settlements surrounding Riyadh. The first major construction beyond the walls was King Abdulaziz's Murabba Palace. It was constructed in 1936, completed in 1938, and a household of 800 people moved into it in 1938. The palace is now part of a bigger complex called The King Abdulaziz Historical Centre. There are other traditional villages and towns in the area around traditional Riyadh which the urban sprawl reached and encompasses. These include Diriyah, Manfuha and Wadi Laban. Unlike in the early days of development in Riyadh during which vernacular structures were razed to the ground without consideration, there is a new-found appreciation for traditional architecture. The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage is making efforts to revitalize the historic architecture in Riyadh and other parts of the kingdom. ;Ain Heet Cave Ain Heet cave has an underground lake (150 meters deep) situated at the face of Mount Al Jubayl in Wadi As Sulay in a small village called Heet in Riyadh. Between Riyadh and Al Kharj road, it is one of the easily accessible caves in the area of Riyadh. =Archaeological sites= The archeological sites at Riyadh which are of historical importance, in which the Municipality of Riyadh is involved, are the five old gates on the old walls of Riyadh. These are the eastern gate of Thumaira, the northern gate of Al-Suwailen, the southern gate of Dukhna, the western gate of Al-Madhbah and the south-western gate of Shumaisi. There are also four historic palaces: Musmak Palace, Murabba Palace (palace of King Abdul Aziz), Atiqah Palace (belongs to Prince Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman) and Al Shamsiah Palace (belongs to Saud Al Kabeer).  Turaif district  The Turaif district, is another important archaeological site inscribed in UNESCO World Heritage List on 31 July 2010. It was founded in the 15th century bearing an architectural style of Najdi. There are some Historic palaces and monuments in Al-Turaif district include: Salwa Palace, Saad bin Saud Palace, The Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House, and Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque.Masmak Fortress Masmak Fortress This fortress was built around 1865 under the reign of Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Rasheed (1289-1315 AH), the ruler of Ha'il to the north, who had wrested control of the city from the rival clan of Al Saud. In January 1902 Ibn Saud, who was at the time living in exile in Kuwait, succeeded in capturing the Masmak fortress from its Rashid garrison. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, has acquired almost mythical status in the history of Saudi Arabia. The story of the event is often retold, and has as its central theme the heroism and bravery of the King Abd Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. The Masmak Fortress is now a museum and is in close proximity to the Clock Tower Square, also known to English-speaking residents as Chop Chop Square, referring to the capital punishment that takes place there. =Contemporary architecture= Kingdom Centre Designed by the team of Ellerbe Becket and Omrania, the tower is built on 94,230 square metres of land. The Kingdom Centre is owned by a group of companies including Kingdom Holding Company, headed by Al-Waleed bin Talal, a prince of the Saudi royal family, and is the headquarters of the holding company. The project cost 2 billion Saudi Arabian Riyals and the contract was undertaken by El-Seif. The Kingdom Centre is the winner of the 2002 Emporis Skyscraper Award, selected as the \\"best new skyscraper of the year for design and functionality\\". A three- level shopping centre, which also won a major design award, fills the east wing. The large opening is illuminated at night in continuously changing colours. The shopping centre has a separate floor for women only to shop where men are not allowed to enter. The Kingdom Tower has 99 stories and is the third tallest structure in the country (behind Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel in Mecca and Burj Rafal in Riyadh), rising to 300 m. A special aspect of the tower is that it is divided into two parts in the last one third of its height and is linked by a sky-bridge walkway, which provides stunning views of Riyadh. Burj Rafal Hotel Kempinski Burj Rafal, located on King Fahd Road, is the tallest skyscraper in Riyadh at 307.9 meters (1,010 feet) tall. The tower was designed and engineered by P & T Group. Construction began in 2010 and was completed 2014. The project was considered a success, with 70% of the residential units already sold by the time the skyscraper was topped out. The tower contains 474 residential condominium units and a 349-room 5-star Kempinski hotel. Burj Al Faisaliyah Al Faisaliyah Centre (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÅŸäÿµŸÑŸäÿ©) is the first skyscraper constructed in Saudi Arabia, and is the third tallest building in Riyadh after the Burj Rafal and the Kingdom Centre. The golden ball that lies atop the tower is said to be inspired by a ballpoint pen, and contains a restaurant; immediately below this is an outside viewing deck. There is a shopping centre with major world brands at ground level. Al Faisaliyah Centre also has a hotel at both sides of the tower while the main building is occupied by office. The Al Faisaliyah Tower has 44 stories. It was designed by Foster and Partners. Riyadh TV Tower The Riyadh TV Tower is a 170 meter high television tower located inside the premises of the Saudi Ministry of Information. It is a vertical cantilever structure which was built between 1978 and 1981. The first movie made in 1983 by the TV tower group and named \\"1,000 Nights and Night\\" had Mohammed Abdu and Talal Mmdah as the main characters. At that time, there were no women on TV because of religious restrictions. Three years later, Abdul Khaliq Al-Ghanim produced a TV series called \\"Tash Ma Tash,\\" which earned a good reaction from audiences in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. This series created a media revolution back in the 1980s. =Museums and collections= In 1999, a new central museum was built in Riyadh, at the eastern side of the King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre. The National Museum of Saudi Arabia combined several collections and pieces that had up until then been scattered over several institutions and other places in Riyadh and the Kingdom. For example, the meteorite fragment known as the \\"Camel's Hump\\", recovered in 1966 from the Wabar site, that was on display at the King Saud University in Riyadh became the new entry piece of the National Museum of Saudi Arabia. The Royal Saudi Air Force Museum, or Saqr Al-Jazira, is located on the East Ring Road of Riyadh between exits 10 and 11. It contains a collection of aircraft and aviation-related items used by the Royal Saudi Air Force and Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines). Sports King Fahd International Stadium Football is the most popular sport in Saudi Arabia. The city hosts four major football clubs, Al Hilal was established in 1957 and has won 15 championships in the Saudi Professional League. Al-Nasr club is another team in the top league that has many supporters around the kingdom. It was established in 1955, and has been named champion of the Saudi League 7:ar:ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸä#√ô.82√ò¬ß√ò¬¶√ô.85ÿ© √ò¬ß√ô.84√ò¬£√ò¬®√ò¬∑√ò¬ß√ô.84 times.Another well-known club, Al-Shabab, was established in 1947 and holds 6 championships. There is also Al-Riyadh Club, which was established in 1954, as well as many other minor clubs. The city also has several large stadiums such as King Fahd International Stadium with a seating capacity of 70,000. The stadium hosted the FIFA Confederations Cup three times, in the years 1992, 1995 and 1997. It also hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1989, and Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium (Al-Malaz Stadium) that is used mostly for football matches. The stadium has a capacity of 22,500 people. The city's GPYW Indoor Stadium served as host arena for the 1997 Asian Basketball Championship, where Saudi Arabia's national basketball team reached the Final Four. On 29 February 2020, the world's richest thoroughbred horse race will take place at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh. The Saudi Cup is a new race for thoroughbreds aged four and up, to be run at weight-for-age terms over 1800m (9f). The prize money is US$20m with a prize of US$10m to the winner and prize money down to tenth place. The Saudi Cup is perfectly positioned between the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai World Cup to attract the best horses from around the world to compete for horse racing's richest prize. Putting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the international horseracing map, the Saudi Cup will also hold an undercard of international races on both dirt and the new turf course. On 26 April 2020, Saudi Arabia entered the bidding process for the 2030 Asian Games, there main rival for this event is Doha, Qatar. Transportation =Airport= Saudi Arabian Airlines ERJ-170 at Riyadh King Khalid International Airport Riyadh aerial highway Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport (KKIA), located 35 kilometers north from the city centre, is the city's main airport, and serves over 17 million passengers a year. Plans are being made to expand the airport to accommodate 35 million passengers, given that the airport was only built for 12 million passengers annually. A possible new airport is on the table. It is one of the largest airports in the world by land area. =Roads= The city is served by a modern major highway system. The main Eastern Ring Road connects the city's south and north, while the Northern Ring Road connects the city's east and west. King Fahd Road runs through the centre of the city from north to south, in parallel with the East Ring Road. Makkah Road, which runs east‚Äìwest across the city's centre, connects eastern parts of the city with the city's main business district and the diplomatic quarters. =Railways and metro= Saudi Railways Organization operates two separate passenger and cargo lines between Riyadh and Dammam, passing through Hofuf and Haradh. Two future railway projects, connecting Riyadh with Jeddah and Mecca in the western region, and connecting Riyadh with Buraidah, Ha'il and Northern Saudi Arabia are underway. A metro is also under construction, with six lines under construction with a scheduled opening in 2020. =Buses= The metro system will be integrated with an , three-line bus rapid transit (BRT) network. The main charter bus company in the kingdom, known as the Saudi Public Transport Company (SAPTCO), offers trips both within the kingdom and to its neighboring countries, including Egypt (via ferries from Safaga or Nuweiba) and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Media The Riyadh TV Tower, operated by the Ministry of Information, was built between 1978 and 1981. National Saudi television channels Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, ART channels network operate from here. Television broadcasts are mainly in Arabic, although some radio broadcasts are in English or French. Arabic is the main language used in television and radio but radio broadcasts are also made in different languages such as Urdu, French, or English. Riyadh has four Arabic newspapers; Asharq Al-Awsat (which is owned by the city governor), Al Riyadh, Al Jazirah and Al-Watan, two English language newspapers; Saudi Gazette and Arab News, and one Malayalam language newspaper, Gulf Madhyamam. Development projects In 2019, King Salman launched a plan to implement 1281 development projects in Riyadh. The project is planned to cost around US$22 billion. The main goal of the plan is to improve the infrastructure, transportation, environment and other facilities in Riyadh and the surrounding area. In the framework of Saudi Vision 2030, the plan will take care of constructing 15 housing units, building a huge museum, establishing an environmental project, sport areas, medical cities, educational facilities and others. This includes the establishment of 14 electricity projects,Louis Boisgibault, Fahad Al Kabbani (2020): Energy Transition in Metropolises, Rural Areas and Deserts. Wiley - ISTE. (Energy series) . 20 sewage projects, 10 housing areas, 66 trading and industrial areas, a number of lakes covering 315,000 square meters and well-advanced sport cities. Alongside with the development project and in the aim of enhancing the artistic movement of the city, 1000 pieces of art are planned to be publicly displayed in the city by the end of 2030. In the framework of Riyadh's development projects, an amount of SR 604 million has been awarded to develop and construct roads of Riyadh. On 3 July 2020, Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia has allocated $20 billion on the mega-project of tourism and culture in Riyadh namely, ‚ÄúDiriyah Gate‚Äù, while facing a double economic crisis after rise in coronavirus cases.

Term The Rhine Province (green) as of 1830 superimposed on modern borders. Historically, the Rhinelands refers (physically speaking) to a loosely defined region embracing the land on the banks of the Rhine in Central Europe, which were settled by Ripuarian and Salian Franks and became part of Frankish Austrasia. In the High Middle Ages, numerous Imperial States along the river emerged from the former stem duchy of Lotharingia, without developing any common political or cultural identity. A \\"Rhineland\\" conceptualization did not evolve until the 19th century after the War of the First Coalition, when a short-lived Cisrhenian Republic was established. The term covered the whole French conquered territory west of the Rhine (German: '), but also including a small portion of the bridgeheads on the eastern banks. After the collapse of the French empire, the regions of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg and Lower Rhine were annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1822 the Prussian administration reorganized the territory as the Rhine Province (Rheinprovinz, also known as Rhenish Prussia), a tradition that continued in the naming of the current German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia. Following the First World War, the western part of Rhineland was occupied by Entente forces, then demilitarized under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and then the 1925 Locarno Treaties. German forces remilitarized the territory in 1936, as part of a diplomatic test of will, three years before the outbreak of the Second World War. Geography Deutsches Eck, Koblenz To the west the area stretches to the borders with Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands; on the eastern side it encompasses the towns and cities along the river and the Bergisches Land area up to the Westphalian (Siegerland) and Hessian regions. Stretching down to the North Palatine Uplands in the south, this area, except for the Saarland, more or less corresponds with the modern use of the term. The southern and eastern parts are mainly hill country (Westerwald, Hunsr√ºck, Siebengebirge, Taunus and Eifel), cut by river valleys, principally the Middle Rhine up to Bingen (or very rarely between the confluence with the Neckar and Cologne) and its Ahr, Moselle and Nahe tributaries. The border of the North German plain is marked by the lower Ruhr. In the south, the river cuts the Rhenish Massif. The area encompasses the western part of the Ruhr industrial region and the Cologne Lowland. Some of the larger cities in the Rhineland are Aachen, Bonn, Cologne, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, Essen, Koblenz, Krefeld, Leverkusen, Mainz, M√∂nchengladbach, M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, Oberhausen, Remscheid, Solingen, Trier and Wuppertal. Toponyms as well as local family names often trace back to the Frankish heritage. The lands on the western shore of the Rhine are strongly characterized by Roman influence, including viticulture. In the core territories, large parts of the population are members of the Catholic Church. History =Pre-Roman= At the earliest historical period, the territories between the Ardennes and the Rhine were occupied by the Treveri, the Eburones and other Celtic tribes, who, however, were all more or less modified and influenced by their Germanic neighbors. On the East bank of the Rhine, between the Main and the Lahn, were the settlements of the Mattiaci, a branch of the Germanic Chatti, while farther to the north were the Usipetes and Tencteri. =Roman and Frankish conquests= Julius Caesar conquered the Celtic tribes on the West bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the East bank. As the power of the Roman empire declined the Franks pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the 5th century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the 8th century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germania and northern Gaul. On the division of the Carolingian Empire at the Treaty of Verdun the part the province to the east of the river fell to East Francia, while that to the west remained with the kingdom of Lotharingia. =Holy Roman Empire= The Holy Roman Empire in 1618 Swedish army on the Spanish troops in Bacharach during the Thirty Years' War By the time of Emperor Otto I (d. 973) both banks of the Rhine had become part of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 959 the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of Upper Lorraine, on the Mosel, and Lower Lorraine on the Meuse. As the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split up into numerous small independent principalities, each with its separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, and while the Lower Lorraine lands were referred to as the Low Countries, the name of Lorraine became restricted to the region on the upper Moselle that still bears it. After the Imperial Reform of 1500/12, the territory was part of the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian, Upper Rhenish, and Electoral Rhenish Circles. Notable Rhenish Imperial States included: *the ecclesiastical electorates of Cologne (without Westphalian possessions) and Trier *the duchies of J√ºlich, Cleves, and Berg, forming the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg from 1521 *the County of Sponheim and numerous further Imperial Counties *the Free Imperial Cities of Aachen and Cologne. In spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbors in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine played a large role in German history. =French Revolution= At the Peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the left bank of the Rhine was taken by France. The population was about 1.6 million in numerous small states. In 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the Confederation of the Rhine, a puppet of Napoleon. France took direct control of the Rhineland until 1814 and radically and permanently liberalized the government, society and economy. The Coalition of France's enemies made repeated efforts to retake the region, but France repelled all the attempts. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. The economic integration of the Rhineland with France increased prosperity, especially in industrial production, while business accelerated with the new efficiency and lowered trade barriers. The Jews were liberated from the ghetto. There was limited resistance; most Germans welcomed the new regime, especially the urban elites, but one sour point was the hostility of the French officials toward the Roman Catholic Church, the choice of most of the residents.Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany, 1648-1840 (1964) pp 386-87 The reforms were permanent. Decades later workers and peasants in the Rhineland often appealed to Jacobinism to oppose unpopular government programs, while the intelligentsia demanded the maintenance of the Napoleonic Code (which was stayed in effect for a century).Michael Rowe, \\"Between Empire and Home Town: Napoleonic Rule on the Rhine, 1799-1814,\\" Historical Journal (1999) 42#2 pp. 643-674 in JSTORMichael Rowe, From Reich to state: the Rhineland in the revolutionary age, 1780-1830 (2003) =Prussian influence= Regierungsbezirke of the Prussian Rhine Province, 1905 map A Prussian influence began on a small scale in 1609 by the occupation of the Duchy of Cleves. A century later, Upper Guelders and Moers also became Prussian. The Congress of Vienna expelled the French and assigned the whole of the lower Rhenish districts to Prussia, who left them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the French. The Rhine Province remained part of Prussia after Germany was unified in 1871. =1918‚Äì1945= The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces. Under the Treaty of Versailles, German troops were banned from all territory west of the Rhine and within 50 kilometers east of the Rhine. In 1920, under massive French pressure, the Saar was separated from the Rhine Province and administered by the League of Nations until a plebiscite in 1935, when the region was returned to Germany. At the same time, in 1920, the districts of Eupen and Malmedy were transferred to Belgium (see German- Speaking Community of Belgium). Shortly after, France completely occupied the Rhineland, strictly controlling all important industrial areas. The Germans responded with passive resistance and hyperinflation; the French gained very little of the reparations they wanted. French troops did not leave the Rhineland until 1925. On 7 March 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, German troops marched into the Rhineland and other regions along the Rhine. German territory west of the Rhine had been off-limits to the German military. In 1945, the Rhineland was the scene of a major fighting as the Allied invaders overwhelmed the German defenders.Ken Ford, The Rhineland 1945: The Last Killing Ground in the West (Osprey, 2000) = Post-1946 = In 1946, the Rhineland was divided into the newly founded states of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Rhineland-Palatinate. North Rhine-Westphalia is one of the prime German industrial areas, containing significant mineral deposits, (coal, lead, lignite, magnesium, oil, and uranium) and water transport. In Rhineland-Palatinate agriculture is more important, including the vineyards in the Ahr, Mittelrhein, and Mosel regions.

White's third move Many responses for White have been analysed.Tony Kosten, The Latvian Gambit Lives!, Batsford, 2001, pp. 7, 117, 175, 199, 210, 217. . The responses not mentioned in this article are 3.d3, 3.b4?!, 3.c4!?, 3.Qe2!?, 3.b3?!, and 3.g4? None of those moves offer White any advantage. Id. at 217. The most important of these are: =3.Nxe5= White's 3.Nxe5 is the main line. After the usual 3...Qf6, White chooses between 4.d4 d6 5.Nc4 fxe4 and the immediate 4.Nc4, which has the advantage of allowing White to open the center with d3, for example 4...fxe4 5.Nc3 Qg6?! 6.d3 exd3? 7.Bxd3 Qxg2? and now White is winning after 8.Qh5+ Kd8 (or 8...g6 9.Qe5+ and 10.Be4) 9.Be4. However, if 6... Bb4, white must be careful following the same line, e.g. 7. Bd2 exd3 8. Bxd3 Qxg2 9. Qh5+ Kd8 10. Be4 Nf6! because now if white plays Bg5, which would be necessary to win the queen in the earlier line, then Bxc3+ wins for black. The main line continues 5...Qf7 6.Ne3! Black usually responds with 6...c6!?, when White can either accept the pawn sacrifice with 7.Nxe4 d5 8.Ng5 Qf6 9.Nf3, or decline it with the more popular 7.d3 exd3 8.Bxd3 d5 9.0-0.Kosten 2001, pp. 78-79, 83-84.

The film centres on a mentally tormented chess grandmaster and the young woman he meets while competing at a world-class tournament in Italy. The screenplay was based on the novel The Defense (or The Luzhin Defence) by Vladimir Nabokov. Emily Watson received best actress nominations at the British Independent Film Awards and the London Film Critics Circle Awards. Plot It's the early 1920s and Aleksandr Ivanovich 'Sascha' Luzhin (Turturro), a gifted but tormented chess player, arrives in a Northern Italian city to compete in an international chess competition. Prior to the tournament he meets Natalia Katkov (Watson) and he falls in love with her almost immediately. She in turn finds his manner to be appealing and they begin to see each other in spite of her mother's disapproval. Competing alongside Luzhin in the championship is Dottore Salvatore Turati (Fabio Sartor), who is approached by Leo Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), a Russian, who is Luzhin's former chess tutor from pre-revolutionary Russia. Valentinov tells the Italian that Luzhin cannot handle pressure and he intimates he will make sure that his former prodigy will be unsettled off- table giving Turati a winning chance. The competition starts badly for Luzhin who is unsettled by the presence of his former friend and coach. He struggles through the early rounds but he soon begins to win again as his relationship with Katkov becomes closer and intimate. She then informs her parents that she is going to marry him. Meanwhile, Luzhin goes on to reach the final and face Turati. But in the finals the Russian √âmigr√© loses out to the time clock, forcing the game to adjourn. However, outside the venue, he is whisked away by an accomplice of Valentinov who abandons him in the countryside. His former teacher knows that this will completely unhinge him because of the memory of his parents' abandonment many years ago. Luzhin wanders aimlessly until he collapses and is found by a group of Blackshirts. Luzhin is taken to the hospital suffering from complete mental exhaustion. The doctor informs Katkov that he will die if he keeps playing chess as he is addicted to the game and it's consuming his very being. Nevertheless, even while recuperating Valentinov comes around with a chess board encouraging Luzhin to finish the match with the Italian, Turati. Natalia defends her beloved but urges him to break off with the game. Luzhin seems to agree. Eventually Luzhin leaves the hospital. He and Natalia then agree to marry at the earliest opportunity. However, on the morning of the wedding, Luzhin is put into a car with Valentinov, who tells him that there is the small matter of finishing the competition. In terror, Luzhin leaps from the car. Dazed, cut and mentally confused, he stumbles back to the hotel where he tries to dig up the rest of the glass chess pieces he buried on the grounds years ago, (1:36:39 \\"I've got the King but I need the whole army...\\") but he does not find them. Luzhin, who is in his muddied wedding suit, sits in his room as Natalia and the hotel staff try to open the door. But before they can get in, the troubled chess grandmaster throws himself out of his bedroom window and dies. The tragic death is witnessed by Valentinov who has just arrived by car. The film then concludes in the competition hall where Natalia completes the competition using her fianc√©'s notes. She discovers the papers in his pocket and an experienced chess player explains to her the matter of the notes. In an arranged meeting without public she plays against Turati who does exactly what Luzhin expected and loses. Katkov and Turati then leave acknowledging the Pyrrhic victory and the genius of Luzhin. Production notes Nabokov based The Defense on the life of German chess master Curt von Bardeleben who seemingly committed suicide by leaping from a window in 1924.\\"In all probability suffering from severe arteriosclerosis, he has had a slight dizzy spell or a rush of blood to the head, and in seeking some fresh air by opening a low silled window he fell out.\\" Mieses and Kagan in Nachrufe in Kagans Neueste Schachnachrichten, Sonderheft No. 2, 1924 The film was shot entirely in Europe. Budapest, Hungary was used for outdoor scenes as they were set in St Petersburg, these included the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge, Hungarian National Museum and Heroes' Square. The chess tournament (although in Italy) was shot inside the main hall of the Museum of Ethnography, Budapest. In Italy, the hotel scenes were filmed at The Bergamo, Lombardia, and Lake Como. The scene at the railway station is in Brenna-Alzate, near Como. In the novel, Valentinov's first name is never mentioned;Leona Toker. Nabokov: The Mystery of Literary Structure, Chap. 5 \\"Secret Asymmetries\\", p. 84, Par. 3. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, 1989. on the contrary, Luzhin's first name is revealed only in the closing sentences. Another dissimilarity is that the novel ends up by Luzhin's suicide, thereby his game would be never finished. The finale The chess position they play for the final between Turati and Luzhin is already a winning position for Black (Luzhin), even though Black is down on material. By playing 1. Kg4 (as opposed to 1. Kf2) White walks into a forced checkmate with a rook sacrifice: * 1. Kg4 f5+ * 2. Kg5 Kg7 If 2. Kh4 Be7# * 3. Nd5 Rh3! * 4. gxh3 h6+ * 5. Kh4 Bf2# If White plays 1. Kf2 instead of 1. Kg4 this leads to a heavy material loss for White and an easy game for Black: * 1. Kf2 Rxc3+ * 2. Ke1 Rxc1+ and Black is up by a rook. In the film Luzhin's final moves were made by his fianc√©. The tournament had been paused after Luzhin had a nervous breakdown which had been caused by extreme strain. On the same day he was going to get married he committed suicide by jumping from the hotel balcony. His fianc√© later found a piece of paper inside his jacket where he had written down his intended final moves against Turati. Cinematic error In Luzhin's previous game, on his way to the final, the film shows an inaccurate checkmating move. The scene shows White (Luzhin) play an apparently brilliant combination culminating in a queen sacrifice followed by Rd1-d8#. However, White's rook on the d1 square is pinned against its king in the corner at h1 by Black's rook on c1, making the checkmate unplayable. Nevertheless, Luzhin (White) is shown playing the illegal winning move to wild applause from the audience. The sequence is as follows, Luzhin has just played his rook to e8 (check) although it is not clear if this was a capture or not. Play then continues: * 1. ... Bf8 * 2. Rxf8+ Kxf8 * 3. Nf5+ Kg8 * 4. Qf8+ Kxf8 * 5. Rd8# White's last move is illegal (see rules of chess). In the film, the Black rook was erroneously placed on c1 instead of c2, where it was in the actual game this winning combination was played, making it legal, a famous win of Milan Vidmar over future world champion Max Euwe.

The red dye stains the polyanionic venom proteins found inside the capsule of this partially-discharged nematocyst. A cnidocyte (also known as a cnidoblast or nematocyte) is an explosive cell containing one giant secretory organelle called a cnidocyst (also known as a cnida (plural cnidae) or nematocyst) that can deliver a sting to other organisms. The presence of this cell defines the phylum Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones, hydrae, jellyfish, etc.). Cnidae are used to capture prey and as a defense against predators. A cnidocyte fires a structure that contains a toxin within the cnidocyst; this is responsible for the stings delivered by a cnidarian.  Structure and function  Each cnidocyte contains an organelle called a cnida, cnidocyst, nematocyst, ptychocyst or spirocyst. This organelle consists of a bulb-shaped capsule containing a coiled hollow tubule structure attached to it. An immature cnidocyte is referred to as a cnidoblast or nematoblast. The externally oriented side of the cell has a hair-like trigger called a cnidocil, which is a mechano- and chemo-receptor. When the trigger is activated, the tubule shaft of the cnidocyst is ejected and, in the case of the penetrant nematocyst, the forcefully ejected tubule penetrates the target organism. This discharge takes a few microseconds, and is able to reach accelerations of about 40,000 g. Recent research suggests the process occurs in as little as 700 nanoseconds, thus reaching an acceleration of up to 5,410,000 g. After penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target organism, allowing the sessile cnidarian to capture the immobilized prey. Recently, in two sea anemone species (Nematostella vectensis and Anthopleura elegantissima), the type I neurotoxin protein Nv1 was shown to be localized in ectodermal gland cells in the tentacles, next to but not in nematocytes. Upon encounter with a crustacean prey, nematocytes discharge and pierce the prey, and Nv1 is massively secreted into the extracellular medium by the nearby gland cells, thus suggesting another mode of entry for toxins. = Cnidocyte capsule composition = The cnidocyte capsule is made of novel Cnidaria-specific genes which combine known protein domains. Minicollagen genes are one of the major structural components of the capsule. They are very short genes containing the characteristic collagen- triple helix sequence, as well as polyproline domains and cystein-rich domains. Trimers of minicollagen proteins assemble through their terminal cystein-rich domain, forming highly organized and rigid supra-structures. Minicollagen 1 Ncol-1 polymers assemble on the inner shell while the outer capsule is composed of polymerized NOWA (Nematocyst Outer Wall Antigen) proteins. Nematogalectin, minicollagen Ncol-15 and chondroitin are novel proteins used to build the tubule shaft. In piercing cnidocytes, the novel protein spinalin is used to make the spines present at the base of the shaft. = Discharge mechanism = Discharge mechanism of a nematocyst The cnidocyst capsule stores a large concentration of calcium ions, which are released from the capsule into the cytoplasm of the cnidocyte when the trigger is activated. This causes a large concentration gradient of calcium across the cnidocyte plasma membrane. The resulting osmotic pressure causes a rapid influx of water into the cell. This increase in water volume in the cytoplasm forces the coiled cnidae tubule to eject rapidly. Prior to discharge the coiled cnidae tubule exists inside the cell in an \\"inside out\\" condition. The back pressure resulting from the influx of water into the cnidocyte together with the opening of the capsule tip structure or operculum, triggers the forceful eversion of the cnidae tubule causing it to right itself as it comes rushing out of the cell with enough force to impale a prey organism. = Prey detection = Cnidae are \\"single use\\" cells, and this costs a lot of energy. In Hydrozoans, in order to regulate discharge, cnidocytes are connected as \\"batteries\\", containing several types of cnidocytes connected to supporting cells and neurons. The supporting cells contain chemosensors, which, together with the mechanoreceptor on the cnidocyte (cnidocil), allow only the right combination of stimuli to cause discharge, such as prey swimming, and chemicals found in prey cuticle or cuteous tissue. This prevents the cnidarian from stinging itself although sloughed off cnidae can be induced to fire independently.  Types of cnidae  Over 30 types of cnidae are found in different cnidarians. They can be divided into the following groups: # Penetrant: The penetrant or stenotele is the largest and most complex nematocyst. When discharged, it pierces the skin or chitinous exoskeleton of the prey and injects the venomous fluid, hypnotoxin, that either paralyzes the victim or kills it. # Glutinant: a sticky surface used to stick to prey, referred to as ptychocysts and found on burrowing (tube) anemones, which help create the tube in which the animal lives # Volvent: The volvent or desmoneme is a small and pear-shaped nematocyst. It contains a short, thick, spineless, smooth and elastic thread tube forming a single loop and closed at the far end. When discharged, it tightly coils around the prey. They are the smallest nematocysts. A lasso-like string is fired at prey and wraps around a cellular projection on the prey, which are referred to as spirocysts. Cnidocyte subtypes can be differentially localized in the animal. In the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, the majority of its non-penetrant sticky cnidocytes, the spirocytes, are found in the tentacles, and are thought to help with prey capture by sticking to the prey. By contrast, the two penetrant types of cnidocytes present in this species display a much broader localization, on the outer epithelial layer of the tentacles and body column, as well as on the pharynx epithelium and within mesenteries. The diversity of cnidocytes types correlates with the expansion and diversification of structural cnidocyst genes like minicollagen genes. Minicollagen genes form compact gene clusters in Cnidarian genomes, suggesting a diversification through gene duplication and subfunctionalization. Anthozoans display less capsule diversity and a reduced number of minicollagen genes, and meduzosoans have more capsule diversity (about 25 types) and a vastly expanded minicollagen genes repertoire. In the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, some minicollagens display a differential expression pattern in different cnidocytes subtypes.  Cnidocyte development  Cnidocytes are single-use cells that need to be continuously replaced throughout the life of the animal with different mode of renewal across species. = Modes of renewal = In Hydra polyps, cnidocytes differentiate from a specific population of stem cells, the interstitial cells (I-cells) located within the body column. Developing nematocytes first undergo multiple rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis, giving rise to nematoblast nests with 8, 16, 32 or 64 cells. After this expansion phase, nematoblasts develop their capsules. Nests separate into single nematocytes when the formation of the capsule is complete. Most of them migrate to the tentacles where they are incorporated into battery cells, which hold several nematocytes, and neurons. Battery cells coordinate firing of nematocytes. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemispherica, nematogenesis takes place at the base of the tentacles, as well as in the manubrium. At the base of the tentacles, nematoblasts proliferate then differentiate along a proximal-distal gradient, giving rise to mature nematocytes in the tentacles through a conveyor belt system. In the Anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, nematocytes are thought to develop throughout the animal from epithelial progenitors. = Cnidocyst maturation = The nematocyst forms through a multi-step assembly process from a giant post-Golgi vacuole. Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus first fuse onto a primary vesicle: the capsule primordium. Subsequent vesicle fusion enables the formation of a tubule outside of the capsule, which then invaginates into the capsule. Then, an early maturation phase enables the formation of long arrays of barbed spines onto the invaginated tubule through the condensation of spinalin proteins. Finally, a late maturation stage gives rise to undischarged capsules under high osmotic pressure through the synthesis of poly-Œ≥-glutamate into the matrix of the capsule. This trapped osmotic pressure enables rapid thread discharge upon triggering through a massive osmotic shock.  Nematocyst toxicity  Nematocysts from Chironex fleckeri (400x magnification) Nematocysts are very efficient weapons. A single nematocyst has been shown to suffice in paralyzing a small arthropod (Drosophila larva). The most deadly cnidocytes (to humans, at least) are found on the body of a box jellyfish. One member of this family, the sea wasp, Chironex fleckeri, is \\"claimed to be the most venomous marine animal known,\\" according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It can cause excruciating pain to humans, sometimes followed by death. Other cnidarians, such as the jellyfish Cyanea capillata (the \\"Lion's Mane\\" made famous by Sherlock Holmes) or the siphonophore Physalia physalis (Portuguese man o' war, \\"Bluebottle\\") can cause extremely painful and sometimes fatal stings. On the other hand, aggregating sea anemones may have the lowest sting intensity, perhaps due to the inability of the nematocysts to penetrate the skin, creating a feeling similar to touching sticky candies. Besides feeding and defense, sea anemone and coral colonies use cnidocytes to sting one another in order to defend or win space. Venom from animals such as cnidarians, scorpions and spiders may be species-specific. A substance that is weakly toxic for humans or other mammals may be strongly toxic to the natural prey or predators of the venomous animal. Such specificity has been used to create new medicines and bioinsecticides, and biopesticides. Animals in the phylum Ctenophora (\\"sea-gooseberries\\" or \\"comb jellies\\") are transparent and jelly-like but have no nematocysts, and are harmless to humans. Certain types of sea slugs, such as the nudibranch aeolids, are known to undergo kleptocnidy (in addition to kleptoplasty), whereby the organisms store nematocysts of digested prey at the tips of their cerata.

Evergreen or dry season deciduous. * Wood lacking lapachol; not especially dense or hard. Heartwood light brown to reddish brown, not distinct from sapwood. * Leaves sometimes simple; usually palmately 3 to 7(9)-foliate; with stalked or sessile lepidote scales. * Inflorescences usually few-flowered panicles, dichotomously branching, without a well-developed, central rachis. * Calyx coriaceous, spathaceous; irregularly 2 to 3-labiate, rarely 5-dentate. * Corolla yellow in 2 species (T. aurea and T. nodosa); otherwise white to pink, rarely red, often with a yellow throat. * Stamens didynamous; staminode small. * Ovary linear, bilocular. * Ovules in 2 or 3 series in each locule. * Fruit a dehiscent capsule, usually linear, sometimes ribbed, glabrous except for lepidote scales. * Seeds thin, with 2 wings; wings hyaline, membranaceous, and sharply demarcated from the seed body. Tabebuia is distinguished from Handroanthus by wood that is not especially hard or heavy, and not abruptly divided into heartwood and sapwood. Lapachol is absent. Scales are present, but no hair. The calyx is usually spathaceous in Tabebuia, but never so in Handroanthus. Only two species of Tabebuia are yellow-flowered, but most species of Handroanthus are. Unlike Roseodendron, the calyx of Tabebuia is always distinctly harder and thicker than the corolla. Tabebuia always has a dichotomously branched inflorescence; never a central rachis as in Roseodendron. Some species of Tabebuia have ribbed fruit, but not as conspicuously so as the two species of Roseodendron. Tabebuia sprout Uses The wood of Tabebuia is light to medium in weight. Tabebuia rosea (including T. pentaphylla) is an important timber tree of tropical America.Samuel J. Record and Robert W. Hess. 1940. \\"American timbers of the family Bignoniaceae\\". Tropical Woods 63:9-38. Tabebuia heterophylla and Tabebuia angustata are the most important timber trees of some of the Caribbean islands. Their wood is of medium weight and is exceptionally durable in contact with salt water.Alwyn H. Gentry. 1992. \\"A Synopsis of Bignoniaceae Ethnobotany and Economic Botany\\". Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 79(1):53-64. The swamp species of Tabebuia have wood that is unusually light in weight. The most prominent example of these is Tabebuia cassinoides. Its roots produce a soft and spongy wood that is used for floats, razor strops, and the inner soles of shoes. In spite of its use for lumber, Tabebuia is best known as an ornamental flowering tree. Tabebuia aurea, Tabebuia rosea, Tabebuia pallida, Tabebuia berteroi, and Tabebuia heterophylla are cultivated throughout the tropics for their showy flowers. Tabebuia dubia, Tabebuia haemantha, Tabebuia obtusifolia, Tabebuia nodosa, and Tabebuia roseo-alba are also known in cultivation and are sometimes locally abundant.Anthony Huxley, Mark Griffiths, and Margot Levy (1992).

Symbolism Tabebuia rosea is the national tree of El Salvador and the state tree of Cojedes, Venezuela. Taxonomic history Trunk of Cuban Pink Trumpet Tree (Tabebuia pallida) The name Tabebuia entered the botanical literature in 1803, when Ant√≥nio Bernardino Gomes used it as a common name for Tabebuia uliginosa, now a synonym for Tabebuia cassinoides, which he described as a species of Bignonia.Antonio B. Gomes. 1803. Observationes Botanico- medicae de Nonnullis Brasiliae Plantis. Lisbon. Tabebuia is an abbreviation of \\"tacyba bebuya\\", a Tupi name meaning \\"ant wood\\".Alwyn H. Gentry. 1969. \\"Tabebuia, the tortuous history of a generic name (Bignoniaceae)\\". Taxon 18(6):635-642. Among the Indigenous peoples in Brazil, similar names exist for various species of Tabebuia. (See External links below). Tabebuia was first used as a generic name by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1838.Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. 1838. \\"Revue sommaire de la famille des Bignoniaceae\\". Bibliotheque Universelle de Gen√®ve, series 2, 17:130. The type species for the genus is Tabebuia uliginosa, which is now a synonym for Tabebuia cassinoides.Tabebuia In: Index Nominum Genericorum. In: Regnum Vegetabile (see External links below). Confusion soon ensued over the meaning of Tabebuia and what to include within it. Most of the misunderstanding was cleared up by Nathaniel Lord Britton in 1915.Nathaniel Lord Britton. 1915. \\"Studies of West Indian plants\\". Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 42(7):372-379. Britton revived the concept of Tabebuia that had been originated in 1876 by Bentham and Hooker, consisting of species with either simple or palmately compound leaves.George Bentham and Joseph D. Hooker. 1876. Genera plantarum :ad exemplaria imprimis in Herberiis Kewensibus servata definita vol. 2 part 2:1026-1053. Reeve & Co. London, England. (See External links below). Similar plants with pinnately compound leaves were placed in Tecoma. This is the concept of Tabebuia that was usually followed until 2007. The genus Roseodendron was established by Faustino Miranda Gonz√°lez in 1965 for the two species now known as Roseodendron donnell-smithii and Roseodendron chryseum.Faustino Miranda-Gonzalez. 1965. \\"Estudios acerca de arboles y arbustos de America Tropical principamente de Mexico\\". Boletin de la Sociedad Botanica de Mexico 29( ):34-49. These species had been placed in Cybistax by Russell J. Seibert in 1940,Russell J. Seibert. 1940. \\"New names in Cybistax and Tabebuia\\". Tropical Woods 63:7-8. but were returned to Tabebuia by Alwyn H. Gentry in 1992. Handroanthus was established by Jo√°o Rodrigues de Mattos in 1970.Jo√°o Rodrigues de Mattos. 1970. \\"Handroanthus, Um novo g√™nero para os \\"ip√™s\\" do Brasil\\". Loefgrenia 50(?):1-4. Gentry did not agree with the segregation of Handroanthus from Tabebuia and warned against \\"succumbing to further paroxysms of unwarranted splitting\\".Alwyn H. Gentry. 1972. \\"Handroanthus (Bignoniaceae): A critique\\". Taxon 21(1):113-114. In 1992, Gentry published a revision of Tabebuia in Flora Neotropica, in which he described 99 species and 1 hybrid, including those species placed by some authors in Roseodendron or Handroanthus. Gentry divided Tabebuia into 10 \\"species groups\\", some of them intentionally artificial. Tabebuia, as currently circumscribed, consists of groups 2,6,7,8,9, and 10. Group 1 is now the genus Roseodendron. Groups 3,4, and 5 compose the genus Handroanthus. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study found Handroanthus to be closer to a certain group of four genera than to Tabebuia. This group consists of Spirotecoma, Parmentiera, Crescentia, and Amphitecna. A phylogenetic tree can be seen at Bignoniaceae. Handroanthus was duly resurrected and 30 species were assigned to it, with species boundaries the same as those of Gentry (1992). Roseodendron was resolved as sister to a clade consisting of Handroanthus and four other genera. This result had only weak statistical support, but Roseodendron clearly did not group with the remainder of Tabebuia. Consequently, Roseodendron was resurrected in its original form. The remaining 67 species of Tabebuia formed a strongly supported clade that is sister to Ekmanianthe, a genus of two species from Cuba and Hispaniola. Tabebuia had been traditionally placed in the tribe Tecomeae, but that tribe is now defined much more narrowly than it had been, and it now excludes Tabebuia.Richard G. Olmstead, Michelle L. Zjhra, L√∫cia G. Lohmann, Susan O. Grose, and Andrew J. Eckert. 2009. \\"A molecular phylogeny and classification of Bignoniaceae\\". American Journal of Botany 96(9):1731-1743. Tabebuia is now one of 12 to 14 genera belonging to a group that is informally called the Tabebuia alliance. This group has not been placed at any particular taxonomic rank. Cladistic analysis of DNA data has strongly supported Tabebuia by Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony. Such studies have so far revealed almost nothing about relationships within the genus, placing nearly all of the sampled species in a large polytomy.

At the time of its establishment, the duchy bordered on the territory of Swedish Pomerania in the north and of Brandenburg in the south. History After more than five years of dispute over succession to the House of Mecklenburg, the duchy was established in 1701 in the territory of the former duchy of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. The G√ºstrow branch of the House of Mecklenburg had died out with the death of Duke Gustav Adolph in 1695. Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin claimed heirship, but he had to deal with the demands of his uncle Adolphus Frederick, husband of Mary of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, the daughter of Gustav Adolph. The emissaries of the Lower Saxon Circle finally negotiated a compromise on March 8, 1701. The agreement created the final, definitive division of Mecklenburg and was sealed with the 1701 Treaty of Hamburg. Section 2 of the treaty established Mecklenburg-Strelitz as a duchy in its own right and assigned it to Adolphus Frederick, together with the Principality of Ratzeburg on the western border of Mecklenburg south of L√ºbeck, the Herrschaft Stargard in the southeast of Mecklenburg, with the cities of Neubrandenburg, Friedland, Woldegk, Strelitz, Burg Stargard, F√ºrstenberg/Havel and Wesenberg, and the commandries of Mirow and Nemerow. At the same time the principle of primogeniture was reasserted, and the right to summon the joint Landtag was reserved to the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The 1701 provisions were maintained with minor changes until the end of the monarchy. Both parties continued to call themselves Dukes of Mecklenburg; Adolphus Frederick took his residence at Strelitz. The Strelitz duchy remained one of the most backward regions of the Empire. Nevertheless, its princesses achieved prominent marriages: Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, sister of Duke Adolphus Frederick IV, married King George III in 1761, thus becoming queen consort of Great Britain. Her niece Princess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, daughter of Duke Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, married Frederick William III of Hohenzollern in 1793 and became queen consort of Prussia in 1797. Her other niece, Louise's sister, Princess Friederike of Mecklenburg-Strelitz married in 1815 Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who, in 1837, became King of Hanover, making her queen consort of Hanover. Mecklenburg-Strelitz adopted the constitution of the sister duchy in September 1755. In 1806 it was spared the infliction of a French occupation through the good offices of the king of Bavaria. In 1808 its duke, Charles (d. 1816), joined the Confederation of the Rhine, but in 1813 he withdrew from it. The Congress of Vienna recognized both Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin as grand duchies and members of the German Confederation.

The style became known as a hybrid of punk and metal. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop and the region's underground music scene. The owners of Sub Pop marketed the style shrewdly, encouraging the media to describe it as \\"grunge\\". By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals. Grunge was commercially successful in the early to mid-1990s due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself.Felix-Jager, Steven. With God on Our Side: Towards a Transformational Theology of Rock and Roll. Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2017. p. 134 Grunge was also an influence on later genres such as post-grunge (such as Creed and Nickelback) and nu metal such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, featuring the distorted electric guitar sound used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, self-doubt, abuse, neglect, betrayal, social and emotional isolation, psychological trauma and a desire for freedom. Several factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the , many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as \\"the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest\\", appeared unusually tortured by success and struggled with an addiction to heroin before his death at the age of 27 in 1994. Origin of the term Mark Arm of Green River whose Dry as a Bone EP was described as \\"ultra-loose grunge\\" in 1987 The word \\"grunge\\" is American slang for \\"someone or something that is repugnant\\" and also for \\"dirt\\". The word was first recorded as being applied to Seattle musicians in July 1987 when Bruce Pavitt described Green River's Dry as a Bone EP in a Sub Pop record company catalogue as \\"gritty vocals, roaring Marshall amps, ultra- loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation\\". Although the word \\"grunge\\" has been used to describe bands since the 1960s, this was the first association of grunge with the grinding, sludgy sound of Seattle. It is expensive and time-consuming to get a recording to sound clean, so for those northwestern bands just starting out it was cheaper for them to leave the sound dirty and just turn up their volume. This dirty sound, due to low budgets, unfamiliarity with recording, and a lack of professionalism may be the origin of the term \\"grunge\\". The \\"Seattle scene\\" refers to that city's alternative music movement that was linked to the University of Washington and the Evergreen State College. Evergreen is a progressive college which does not use a conventional grading system and has its own radio station, KAOS. Seattle's remoteness from Los Angeles led to a perceived purity of its music. The music of these bands, many of which had recorded with Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, became labeled as \\"grunge\\".Shuker, Roy. Understanding Popular Music Culture, 4th Edition. Routledge, 2013. p. 182 Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain, in one of his final interviews, credited Jonathan Poneman, cofounder of Sub Pop, with coining the term \\"grunge\\" to describe the music. The term \\"Seattle sound\\" became a marketing ploy for the music industry. In September 1991, the Nirvana album Nevermind was released, bringing mainstream attention to the music of Seattle. Cobain loathed the word \\"grunge\\" and despised the new scene that was developing, feeling that record companies were signing old \\"cock-rock\\" bands who were pretending to be grunge and claiming to be from Seattle. Some bands associated with the genre, such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, have not been receptive to the label, preferring instead to be referred to as \\"rock and roll\\" bands. Ben Shepherd from Soundgarden stated that he \\"hates the word\\" grunge and hates \\"being associated with it.\\" Seattle musician Jeff Stetson states that when he visited Seattle in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a touring musician, the local musicians did not refer to themselves as \\"grunge\\" performers or their style as \\"grunge\\" and they were not flattered that their music was being called \\"grunge\\". Rolling Stone noted the genre's lack of a clear definition. Robert Loss acknowledges the challenges of defining \\"grunge\\"; stating that while he can recount stories about grunge, they do not serve to provide a useful definition. Roy Shuker states that the term \\"obscured a variety of styles.\\" Stetson states that grunge was not a movement, \\"monolithic musical genre\\", or a way to react to 1980s-era metal pop; he calls the term a misnomer mostly based on hype. Stetson states that prominent bands considered to be grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney and Hammerbox) all sound different. Mark Yarm, author of Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge, pointed out vast differences between grunge bands, with some being punk and others being metal-based.  Musical style  A museum exhibition about the Seattle music scene, with record sleeves of Nevermind and In Utero by Nirvana and Badmotorfinger by Soundgarden In 1984, the punk rock band Black Flag went visiting small towns across the US to bring punk to the more remote parts of the country. By this time their music had become slow and sludgy, less like the Sex Pistols and more like Black Sabbath. Krist Novoselic (later the bass player with Nirvana) recalls going along with the Melvins to see one of these shows, after which the Melvins front man Buzz Osborne began writing \\"slow and heavy riffs\\" to form a dirge-like music that was the beginning of northwest grunge. The Melvins were the most influential of the early grunge bands. Sub Pop producer Jack Endino described grunge as \\"seventies-influenced, slowed-down punk music\\". Leighton Beezer, who played with Mark Arm and Steve Turner in The Thrown Ups, states that when he first heard Green River play Come On Down, he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. Additionally, he noted that the augmented fifth note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary Hype!, Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from Rockaway Beach by The Ramones that ascends the neck of the guitar, then Come On Down by Green River that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound completely unalike. He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge. Early grunge bands would also copy a riff from metal and slow it down, play it backwards, distort it and bury it in feedback, then shout lyrics with little melody over the top of it. Grunge fuses elements of punk rock (specifically American hardcore punk such as Black Flag) and heavy metal (especially traditional, earlier heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath), although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Alex DiBlasi feels that indie rock was a third key source, with the most important influence coming from Sonic Youth's \\"free-form\\" noise. Grunge shares with punk a raw, lo fi sound and similar lyrical concerns, and it also used punk's haphazard and untrained approach to playing and performing. However, grunge was \\"deeper and darker\\"-sounding than punk rock and it decreased the \\"adrenaline\\"-fueled tempos of punk to a slow, \\"sludgy\\" speed, and used more dissonant harmonies. Seattle music journalist Charles R. Cross defines \\"grunge\\" as distortion- filled, down-tuned and riff-based rock that uses loud electric guitar feedback and heavy, \\"ponderous\\" bass lines to support its song melodies. Robert Loss calls grunge a melding of \\"violence and speed, muscularity and melody\\", where there is space for all people, including women musicians. VH1 writer Dan Tucker feels that different grunge bands were influenced by different genres; that while Nirvana drew on punk, Pearl Jam was influenced by classic rock, and that \\"sludgy, dark, heavy bands\\" such as Soundgarden and Alice in Chains had a sinister metal tone. Grunge music has what has been called an \\"ugly\\" aesthetic, both in the roar of the distorted electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the \\"slick\\" elegant sound of the then-predominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the \\"ugliness\\" they saw around them and shine a light on unseen \\"depths and depravity\\" of the real world. Some key individuals in the development of the grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, described grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as \\"musical provocation\\". Grunge artists considered these bands \\"cheesy\\" but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with.Pray, D., Helvey-Pray Productions (1996). Hype! Republic Pictures. In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature \\"stop-start\\" song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention.  Instrumentation  = Electric guitar = Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a thick middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\".Moody, Fred. Seattle and the Demons of Ambition: A Love Story. or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic.Whitehead, John W. Grasping for the Wind: The Search for Meaning in the 20th century. 2001. p. 171 As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Felix-Jager, Steven. With God on Our Side: Towards a Transformational Theology of Rock and Roll. Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2017. p. 135 Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".Shepherd, John and Horn, David. Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America. A&C; Black, 2012. p. 23 In the song \\"Mudride\\", the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Boss DS-2 distortion pedal was one of the key effects (including the related DS-1) that created the growling, overdriven guitar sound in grunge. Other key pedals used by grunge bands included four brands of distortion pedals (the Big Muff, DOD and Boss DS-2 and Boss DS-1 distortion pedals) and the Small Clone chorus effect, used by Kurt Cobain on \\"Come As You Are\\" and by the Screaming Trees on \\"Nearly Lost You\\". The DS-1 (later DS-2) distortion pedal played a key role in Cobain's switching from quiet to loud and back to quiet approach to songwriting. The use of small pedals by grunge guitarists helped to start off the revival of interest in boutique, hand-soldered, 1970s-style analog pedals. The other effect that grunge guitarists used was one of the most low-tech effects devices, the wah-wah pedal. Both \\"[Kim] Thayil and Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell ... were great advocates of the wah wah pedal.\\" Wah was also used by the Screaming Trees, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr. Grunge guitarists played loud, with Kurt Cobain's early guitar sound coming from an unusual set-up of four 800 watt PA system power amplifiers. Guitar feedback effects, in which a highly amplified electric guitar is held in front of its speaker, were used to create high-pitched, sustained sounds that are not possible with regular guitar technique. Grunge guitarists were influenced by the raw, primitive sound of punk, and they favored \\"... energy and lack of finesse over technique and precision\\"; key guitar influences included the Sex Pistols, The Dead Boys, Celtic Frost, Voivod, Neil YoungWilkes, David. \\"Neil Young: Heart of Grunge?\\" New York Times: 1. December 6, 1992. ProQuest. Web. October 5, 2015 (Rust Never Sleeps, side two), The Replacements, H√ºsker D√º, Black Flag and The Melvins.Prown, Pete and Newquist, Harvey P. Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997. p. 242-243 Grunge guitarists often downtuned their instruments for a lower, heavier sound. Soundgarden's guitarist, Kim Thayil, did not use a regular guitar amplifier; instead, he used a bass combo amp equipped with a 15-inch speaker as he played low riffs, and the bass amp gave him a deeper tone. = Guitar solos = Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil's punk attitudes encouraged him to downplay soloing in the 1980s; however, when other leading grunge bands such as Nirvana started to de-emphasize the role of the solo during the early 1990s, he began to do solos again. Grunge guitarists \\"flatly rejected\\" the virtuoso \\"shredding\\" guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs, instead opting for melodic, blues-inspired solos ‚Äì focusing \\"on the song, not the guitar solo\\".Cataldo, Tomas. Rock Licks Encyclopedia. Alfred Music Publishing, 2001. p. 75. Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill. In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had \\"guitar anti-heroes\\" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument. In Will Byers' article \\"Grunge committed a crime against music‚Äîit killed the guitar solo\\", in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge. He states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement. The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana \\"killed the guitar solo\\". Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the \\"death of the guitar solo\\"; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo. Baeble Music calls the grunge guitar solos of the 1990s \\"..raw\\", \\"sloppy\\" and \\"basic\\". Not all sources support the \\"grunge killed the guitar solo\\" argument. Sean Gonzalez states that Pearl Jam has plentiful examples of guitar solos. Michael Azerrad praises the guitar playing of Mudhoney's Steve Turner, calling him the \\"... Eric Clapton of grunge\\", a reference to the British blues guitarist who Time magazine has named as number five in their list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\". Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready has been praised for his blues-influenced, rapid licks. The Smashing Pumpkins' guitarist Billy Corgan has been called the \\"... arena rock genius of the '90s\\" for pioneering guitar playing techniques and showing through his playing skill that grunge guitarists do not have to be sloppy players to rebel against mainstream music. Thayil stated that when other major grunge bands, such as Nirvana, were reducing their guitar solos, Soundgarden responded by bringing back the solos. = Bass guitar = The early Seattle grunge album Skin Yard recorded in 1987 by the band of the same name included fuzz bass (overdriven bass guitar) played by Jack Endino and Daniel House. Some grunge bassists, such as Ben Shepherd, layered power chords with distorted low-end density by adding a fifth and an octave-higher note to a bass note. An example of the powerful, loud bass amplifier systems used in grunge is Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez's setup. He uses four powerful Ampeg SVT-2 PRO tube amplifier heads, two of them plugged into four 1x18\\" subwoofer cabinets for the low register, and the other two plugged into two 8x10\\" cabinets. Krist Novoselic and Jeff Ament are also known for using Ampeg SVT tube amplifiers. Ben Shepherd uses a 300 watt all-tube Ampeg SVT-VR amp and a 600 watt Mesa/Boogie Carbine M6 amplifier. Ament uses four 6x10\\" speaker cabinets. = Drums = Drummer Matt Cameron, who played with Pearl Jam and Soundgarden In contrast to the \\"massive drum kits\\" used in 1980s pop metal,Weinstein, Deena. Rock'n America. University of Toronto Press, 2015. p. 223 grunge drummers used relatively smaller drum kits. One example is the drumkit used by Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron's set-up. He uses a six-piece kit (this way of describing drumkits counts only the wooden drums, and does not count the cymbals), including a \\"12x8-inch rack tom; 13x9-inch rack tom; 16x14-inch floor tom; 18x16-inch floor tom; 24x14-inch bass drum\\" and a snare drum and, for cymbals, Zildjian instruments, including \\"... 14-inch K Light [Hi-]hats; 17-inch K Custom Dark crash [cymbal] and 18-inch K Crash Ride; 19-inch Projection crash; a 20-inch Rezo crash; ... and a ... 22-inch A Medium ride [cymbal]\\". A second example is Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's set-up during 1990 and 1991. He used a four-piece Tama drumset, with an 8\\" √ó 14\\" birch snare drum, a 14\\" √ó 15\\" rack tom, a 16\\" √ó 18\\" floor tom and a 16\\" √ó 24\\" bass drum (this kit \\"... was demolished at the Cabaret Metro, Chicago, 10/12/91\\"). Like Matt Cameron, Dave Grohl used Zildjian cymbals. Grohl used the company's A Series Medium cymbals, including an 18\\" and a 20\\" crash cymbal, a 22\\" ride cymbal and a pair of 15\\" hi-hat cymbals. = Other instruments = Although keyboards are generally not used in grunge, Seattle band Gorilla created controversy by breaking the \\"guitars only\\" approach and using a 1960s-style Vox organ in their group. In 2002, Pearl Jam added a keyboard player, Kenneth \\"Boom\\" Gaspar, who played piano, Hammond organ and other keyboards; the addition of a keyboardist to the band would have been \\"inconceivable\\" in the band's \\"grungy\\" early years, but it shows how a group's sound can change over time.Corbett, Bernard M. and Harkins, Thomas Edward. Pearl Jam FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Seattle's Most Enduring Band. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2016 = Vocals = Vocalist Eddie Vedder, from Pearl Jam, is noted for his expressive singing style. The grunge singing style was similar to the \\"outburst\\" of loud, heavily distorted electric guitar in tone and delivery; Kurt Cobain used a \\"gruff, slurred articulation and gritty timbre\\" and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam made use of a \\"wide, powerful vibrato\\" to show his \\"depth of expression.\\" In general, grunge singers used a \\"deeper vocal style\\" which matched the lower-sounding, downtuned guitars and the darker-themed lyrical messages used in the style. Grunge singers used \\"gravelly, raspy\\" vocals, \\"... growls, moans, screams and mumbles\\" Moody, Fred. Seattle and the Demons of Ambition: A Love Story. 2004. p. 171. and \\"plaintive groans\\"; this range of singing styles was used to communicate the \\"varied emotions\\" of the lyrics.Fournier, Karen. The Words and Music of Alanis Morissette. ABC-CLIO, 2015. p. 44 Cobain's reaction to the \\"bad times\\" and discontent of the era was that he screamed his lyrics.Talley, Tara. \\"Grunge and Blues, A Sociological Comparison:How Space and Place Influence the Development and Spread of Regional Musical Styles\\". Chrestomathy: Annual Review of Undergraduate Research, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Charleston Volume 4, 2005: pp. 228‚Äì240. p. 233 In general, grunge songs were sung \\"simply, often somewhat unintelligibly\\"; the virtuoso \\"operatics of hair-metal were shunned.\\" Grunge singing has been characterized as \\"borderline out-of- tune vocals\\".  Lyrics and themes  Grunge lyrics are typically dark, nihilistic, wretched, angst-filled and anguished, often addressing themes such as social alienation, self-doubt, abuse, neglectance, betrayal, social isolation/emotional isolation, psychological trauma and a desire for freedom. An article by MIT states that grunge \\"lyrics [were] obsessed with disenfranchisement\\" and described a mood of \\"resigned despair\\". Catherine Strong states that grunge songs were usually about \\"negative experiences or feelings\\", with the main themes being alienation and depression, but with an \\"ironic sneer.\\" Strong, Catherine. Grunge: Music and Memory. Routledge, 2016. p.19 Grunge artists expressed \\"strong feelings\\" in their lyrics about \\"societal ills\\", including a \\"desire to 'crucify the insincere'\\", an approach which fans appreciated for its authenticity.Talley, Tara. \\"Grunge and Blues, A Sociological Comparison:How Space and Place Influence the Development and Spread of Regional Musical Styles\\". Chrestomathy: Annual Review of Undergraduate Research, School of Humanities and Social Sciences,College of Charleston Volume 4, 2005: pp. 228‚Äì240. p. 236 Grunge lyrics have been criticized as \\"... violent and often obscene.\\" Whitehead, John W. Grasping for the Wind: The Search for Meaning in the 20th Century. 2001. p. 247 In 1996, conservative columnist Rich Lowry wrote an essay criticizing grunge, entitled \\"Heroin, Our Hero\\"; he called it a music that is mostly \\"... shorn of ideals and the impulse for political action\\".Marion, Nancy E and Oliver, Willard M. Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture. and the Law. ABC-CLIO, 2014. p. 888. A number of factors influenced the focus on such subject matter. Many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society, as well as a discomfort with social prejudices. Grunge lyrics contained \\"... explicit political messages and ... questioning about ... society and how it might be changed ...\\".Strong, Catherine. Grunge: Music and Memory. Routledge, 2016. p.5 While grunge lyrics were less overtly political than punk songs, grunge songs still indicated a concern for social issues, particularly those affecting young people. The main themes in grunge were \\"tolerance of difference\\", \\"support of women\\", \\"mistrust of authority\\" and \\"cynicism towards big corporations.\\" Grunge song themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians. In 1992, music critic Simon Reynolds said that \\"there's a feeling of burnout in the culture at large. Kids are depressed about the future\\". The topics of grunge lyrics‚Äìhomelessness, suicide, rape, \\"broken homes, drug addiction and self-loathing\\" contrasted sharply to the glam metal lyrics of Poison, which described \\"life in the fast lane\\",Gina Misiroglu. American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History. Routledge, 2015. p. 343 partying and hedonism. Grunge lyrics developed as part of \\"Generation X malaise\\", reflecting that demographic's feelings of \\"disillusionment and uselessness\\".Music Cultures in the United States: An Introduction. Ed. Ellen Koskoff. Routledge, 2005. p. 359 Grunge songs about love were usually about \\"... failed, boring, doomed or destructive relationships.\\" (e.g., \\"Black\\" by Pearl Jam). The Alice in Chains songs \\"Sickman\\", \\"Junkhead\\", \\"God Smack\\" and \\"Hate to Feel\\" have references to heroin.Liner notes, Music Bank box set. Columbia. 1999. Grunge lyrics tended to be more introspective and aimed to enable the listener to see into \\"hidden\\" personal issues and examine the \\"depravity\\" of the world. This approach can be seen in Mudhoney's song \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\", which includes lyrics with \\"deranged imagery\\" which depict a \\"broken world and a fragmented self-image\\"; the song includes the lines \\"I feel bad, and I've felt worse\\" and \\"I won't live long and I'm full of rot\\". Nirvana's song \\"Lithium\\", from their 1991 album Nevermind, is about a \\"... man who finds faith after his girlfriend's suicide\\"; it depicts \\"... irony and ugliness\\" as a way of dealing with these \\"dark issues\\".  Recording production  Like punk, grunge's sound came from a lo fi (low fidelity) recording and production approach. Before the arrival of major labels, early grunge albums were recorded using low-budget studios: \\"Nirvana's first album Bleach, was recorded for $606.17 in 1989.\\" Sub Pop recorded most of their music at a \\"... low-rent studio named Reciprocal\\", where producer Jack Endino created the grunge genre's aesthetic, a \\"raw and unpolished sound with distortion, but usually without any added studio effects\\".Clapp, Edward P. Participatory Creativity: Introducing Access and Equity to the Creative Classroom. Routledge, 2016. Endino is known for his stripped-down recording practices and his dislike of 'over-producing' music with effects and remastering. His work on Soundgarden's Screaming Life and Nirvana's Bleach as well as for the bands Green River, Screaming Trees, L7, The Gits, Hole, 7 Year Bitch, and TAD helped to define the grunge sound. An example of the lower cost production approach is Mudhoney; even after the band signed to Warner Music, \\"[t]rue to [the band's] indie roots ... [they are] ... probably one of the few bands that would have to fight [their label] to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one.\\" Steve Albini was another important influence on the grunge sound. Albini prefers to be called a \\"recording engineer\\", because he believes that putting record producers in charge of recording sessions often destroys the band's real sound, while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians, not to threaten the artists' control over their creative product.MTSU-lecture-2004 Albini's recordings have been analyzed by writers such as Michael Azerrad, who stated that Albini's \\"recordings were both very basic and very exacting: like Endino, Albini used few special effects; got an aggressive, often violent guitar sound; and made sure the rhythm section slammed as one.\\"Azerrad, Michael (2001). Our band could be your life : scenes from the American indie underground 1981‚Äì1991 (1 ed.). Boston: Little, Brown. . Retrieved January 11, 2014. p. 344 Nirvana's In Utero is a typical example of Albini's recording approach. He preferred to have the entire band play live in the studio, rather than use mainstream rock's approach of recording each instrument on a separate track at different times, and then mixing them using multi-track recording. While multitracking results in a more polished product, it does not capture the \\"live\\" sound of the band playing together. Albini used a range of different microphones for the vocals and instruments. Like most metal and punk recording engineers, he mics the guitar amp speakers and bass amp speakers to capture each performer's unique tone.  Concerts  Grunge concerts, like the heavy metal, punk rock and hardcore shows that influenced grunge's development, were loud. Pictured is Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament in front of a wall of bass stacks. Grunge concerts were known for being straightforward, high-energy performances. Grunge shows were \\"... celebrations, parties [and] carnivals\\" where the audience expressed its spirit by stagediving, moshing and thrashing.Henderson, Justin. Grunge: Seattle. Roaring Forties Press, 2016. Ch. 5 Simon Reynolds states that in \\"... some of the most masculine forms of rock ‚Äîthrash metal, grunge, moshing becomes a form of surrogate combat\\" in which \\"male bodies\\" can contact in the \\"sweat-and- bloodbath\\" of the moshpit.Reynolds, Simon. The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll. Harvard University Press, 1996. p. 109 As with punk shows, grunge \\"... performances were about frontmen who screamed and jumped around on stage and musicians who thrashed wildly on their instruments.\\" While grunge lyrical themes focused on \\"angst and rage\\", the audience at shows were positive and created a \\"life-affirming\\" attitude. Grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres, including the use of complex digitally controlled light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects then popular in \\"hair metal\\" shows. Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and \\"onstage theatrics\\" were generally avoided. Instead the bands presented themselves as no different from minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary Hype! that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective was not to be entertainers, but simply to \\"rock out\\". Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as \\"a symbolic weapon\\" for releasing \\"pent-up aggression\\" (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his \\"head flips\\").Fournier, Karen. The Words and Music of Alanis Morissette. ABC-CLIO, 2015. p. 44 One of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity. Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, \\"for Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music ... And if you can't, can you live with being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?\\"Marsh, Dave. \\"LIVE THROUGH THIS. ... \\". Rock & Rap Archives 124.  Clothing and fashion  = 1980s‚Äì1990s = Courtney Love has been considered one of the top ten women who defined 1990s style by popularizing the \\"kinderwhore\\" style. commonly worn by grunge musicians in Washington were a \\"mundane everyday style\\", in which they would wear the same clothes on stage that they wore at home. This Pacific Northwest \\"slacker style\\" or \\"slouch look\\" contrasted sharply with the \\"wild\\" mohawks, leather jackets and chains worn by punks. This everyday clothing approach was used by grunge musicians because authenticity was a key principle in the Seattle scene. The grunge look typically consisted of second-hand clothes or thrift store items and the typical outdoor clothing (most notably flannel shirts) of the region, as well as a generally unkempt appearance and long hair. For grunge singers, long hair was used \\"as a mask to conceal the face\\" so they can \\"expres[s their] innermost thoughts\\"; Cobain is a notable example. Male grunge musicians were \\"... unkempt ... [and] ... unshaven [,] with ... tousled hair\\" that was often unwashed, greasy and \\"... matted [into a] sheep- dog mop\\". The lumberjack attire was a common sight in the thrift stores near Seattle for the low prices that musicians could afford. Grunge style consisted of ripped jeans, thermal underwear, mom jeans, Doc Martens boots or combat boots (often unlaced), band T-shirts, oversized knit sweaters, long and droopy skirts, ripped tights, Birkenstocks, hiking boots, and eco-friendly clothing made from recycled textiles or fair trade organic cotton. As well, since women in the grunge scene wore the \\"... same plaid [shirt]s, boots, and short cropped heads as their male counterparts\\", women showed \\"... that they are not defined by their sex appeal.\\" \\"Grunge ... became an anti-consumerist movement where the less you spent on clothes, the more 'coolness' you had.\\" The style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, \\"[Nirvana frontman] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo\\", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, \\"This [clothing] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs against the grain of the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s.\\" The flannel and \\"... cracked leatherette coats\\" in the grunge scene were part \\"... of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the \\"manufactured image\\", often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the 'grunge look' in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad \\"were given blue collar identities that weren't entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.\\" Dazed magazine called Courtney Love one of \\"ten women who defined the 1990s\\" from a style perspective: the \\"... image of Courtney Love's too-short baby doll dress, tattered fur coat and shock of platinum hair\\", a look dubbed \\"kinderwhore\\", \\"... topped with a tiara, of course ‚Äì is seared on the memory of anyone who lived through the decade.\\" The kinderwhore look consisted of torn, ripped tight or low-cut babydoll and Peter-Pan-collared dresses, slips, heavy makeup with dark eyeliner, barrettes, and leather boots or Mary‚ÄìJane shoes.\\"Miss World\\" music video. Viewed on dailymotion at http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1sf1c_hole-miss-world_music Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland was the first to define it, while Courtney Love of Hole was the first to popularize it. Love has claimed that she took the style from Divinyls frontwoman Christina Amphlett. The look became very popular in 1994. Vogue stated in 2014 that \\"Cobain pulled liberally from both ends of a woman's and a man's wardrobe, and his Seattle thrift-store look ran the gamut of masculine lumberjack workwear and 40s-by-way-of-70s feminine dresses. It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny.\\" Cobain's way of dressing \\"was the antithesis of the macho American man\\", because he \\"... made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no matter if you were a boy or a girl.\\" Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress \\"Not only did he make it okay to be a freak, he made it desirable.\\" = Adoption by mainstream = Grunge music hit the mainstream in the early 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts to cash in on the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the 'realism' of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season. In the same year, Vogue did a spread called \\"Grunge & Glory\\" with fashion photographer Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, as she had her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: \\"to me the thing about grunge is it's not anti-fashion, it's unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.\\" The unkempt fashion sense defined the look of the \\"slacker generation\\", who \\"skipped school, smoked pot ... [and] cigarettes and listened to music\\" hoping to become a rock star one day. = 2000s‚Äì2010s = Even though the grunge movement died down in 1994 after the death of Kurt Cobain, designers have continued to draw inspiration from the movement from time to time. Grunge appeared as a trend again in 2008 and for Fall/Winter 2013, Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent brought back grunge to the runway. With Courtney Love as his muse for the collection, she reportedly loved the collection. \\"No offense to MJ [Marc Jacobs] but he never got it right,\\" Courtney said. \\"This is what it really was. Hedi knows his shit. He got it accurate, and MJ and Anna [Sui] did not.\\" Both Cobain and Love apparently burnt the Perry Ellis collection they received from Marc Jacobs back in 1993. In 2016, grunge inspired an upscale \\"reinvention\\" of the style by A$AP Rocky, Rihanna and Kanye West. However, \\"dressing grunge is no longer a badge of authenticity, though: the signifiers of rebellion (Dr Martens boots, plaid shirts) are omnipotent on the high street\\", says Lynette Nylander, deputy editor of i-D magazine.  Alcohol and drugs  The title of Nirvana's debut album Bleach referred to the 1980s-era public health posters which urged heroin injectors to use bleach to clean their needles, to prevent AIDS transmission. Many music subcultures are associated with particular drugs, such as the hippie counterculture and reggae, both of which are associated with marijuana and psychedelics. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of heroin by musicians in the Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 New York Times article listing the city's \\"three principal drugs\\" as \\"espresso, beer and heroin\\" and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the \\"... subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin\\". Tim Jonze from The Guardian states that \\"... heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its inception in the mid-80s\\" and he argues that the \\"... involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect to the music\\"; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland, as well as Courtney Love, Mark Lanegan, Jimmy Chamberlin and Evan Dando \\"... all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell the tale.\\" A 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s, people used the \\"stimulant\\" cocaine to socialize and \\"... celebrate good times\\", in the 1990s grunge scene, the \\"depressant\\" heroin was used to \\"retreat\\" into a \\"cocoon\\" and be \\"... sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offered ... few prospects for ... change or hope.\\"Marion, Nancy E and Oliver, Willard M. Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture. and the Law. ABC-CLIO, 2014 . p. 888. Justin Henderson states that all of the \\"downer\\" opiates, including \\"heroin, morphine, etorphine, codeine, opium, [and] hydrocodone ... seemed to be the habit of choice for many a grunger\\".Henderson, Justin. Grunge: Seattle. Roaring Forties Press, 2016. Ch. 5 \\"the really big time\\", section: \\"here come the tabloids!\\" The title of Nirvana's debut album Bleach was inspired by a harm reduction poster aimed at heroin injection users, which stated \\"Bleach your works [e.g., syringe and needle] before you get stoned\\". The poster was released by the U.S. State Health Department which was trying to reduce AIDS transmission caused through sharing used needles. Alice in Chains' song \\"God Smack\\" includes the line \\"stick your arm for some real fun\\", a reference to injecting heroin. Seattle musicians known to use heroin included Cobain, who was using \\"heroin when he shot himself in the head\\"; \\"Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone [who] overdosed on heroin in 1990\\"; \\"Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch [who] died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992 ... [and] Layne Staley of Alice in Chains [who] publicly detailed his battles with heroin ...\\". Mike Starr of Alice in Chains and Jonathan Melvoin from The Smashing Pumpkins also died from heroin. After Cobain's death, his \\"... widow, singer Courtney Love, characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than in San Francisco or Los Angeles.\\" However, Daniel House, who owned C/Z Records, disputed these perceptions in 1994. House stated that there was \\"... no more (heroin) here [in Seattle] than anyplace else\\"; he stated that the \\"heroin is not a big part of the [Seattle music] culture\\", and that \\"marijuana and alcohol ... are far more prevalent\\". Jeff Gilbert, one of the editors of Guitar World magazine, stated in 1994 that the media association of the Seattle grunge scene with heroin was \\"really overblown\\"; instead, he says that Seattle musicians were \\"... all a bunch of potheads.\\" Gil Troy's history of America in the 1990s states that in the Seattle grunge scene, the \\"... drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine [of the 1980s] to blue-collar marijuana.\\"Troy, Gil. The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s.Macmillan, 2015. p. 105 Rolling Stone magazine reported that members of Seattle's grunge scene were \\"coffee-crazed\\" by day on espresso and \\"... by night, they quaff[ed] oceans of beer ‚Äì jolted by Java and looped with liquor, no wonder the [grunge] music sounds like it does.\\" Azzerad, Michael. \\"Grunge City: The Seattle Scene For real rockers, Seattle is the ultimate Wet Dream.\\" Rolling Stone April 16, 1992 https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grunge-city-the-seattle-scene-19920416 \\"Some [Seattle] scene veterans maintain that MDA\\", a drug related to Ecstasy, \\"was a vital contributor to grunge\\", because it gave users a \\"body high\\" (in contrast to marijuana's \\"head high\\") that made them appreciate \\"bass-heavy grooves\\".SPIN. Apr 2004 ‚Äì Page 65. Vol. 20, No. 4 Pat Long's History of the NME states that scene members involved with the Sub Pop label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls Ecstasy's \\"warm glow\\" had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.Long, Pat. The History of the NME: High times and low lives at the world's most famous music magazine. Pavilion Books, 2012.  Graphic design  Ray Gun magazine used \\"grunge graphic design\\", in which the letters and typefaces were distressed and distorted. Regarding graphic design and images, a common feature of grunge bands was the use of \\"lo-fi\\" (low fidelity) and deliberately unconventional album covers, for example presenting intentionally murky or miscolored photography, collage or distressed lettering. Early grunge \\"[a]lbum covers and concert flyers appeared Xeroxed not in allegiance to some DIY aesthetic\\" but because of \\"economic necessity\\", as \\"bands had so little money\\".Dousner, Stephen. \\"Is there anything left to say about Kurt Cobain's legacy\\". Pitchfork. March 31, 2014 This was already a common feature of punk rock design, but could be extended in the grunge period due to the increasing use of Macintosh computers for desktop publishing and digital image processing. The style was sometimes called 'grunge typography' when used outside music. A famous example of 'grunge'-style experimental design was Ray Gun magazine, art directed by David Carson. Carson, developed a technique of \\"ripping, shredding and remaking letters\\" and using \\"overprinted, disharmonious letters\\" and experimental design approaches, including \\"deliberate 'mistakes' in alignment\\".Eskilon, Stephen. Graphic Design: A New History, Second Edition. Yale University Press, 2012. Carson's art used \\"... messy and chaotic design\\" and he did not \\"..respect any rule of composition\\", using an \\"..experimental, personal and intuitive\\" approach. Another \\"grunge graphic designer\\" was Elliott Earls, who used \\"distorted ... older typefaces\\" and \\"aggressively illegible\\" type which adopted the \\"unkempt expressiveness\\" of the \\"grunge [music] aesthetic\\"; this radical, anti-establishment approach in graphic design was influenced by the 1910s-era avant-garde Dada movement. Hat Nguyen's Droplet, Harriet Goren's Morire and Eric Lin's Tema Canante were all \\"signature grunge fonts.\\" Sven Lennartz states that grunge design images have a \\"realistic, genuine look\\" which is created by adding simulated torn paper, dog-eared corners, creases, yellowed scotch tape, coffee cup stains, hand-drawn images and handwritten words, typically over a \\"dirty\\" background texture which is done with dull, subdued colors. A key figure in creating the \\"look\\" of the grunge scene for outsiders was music photographer Charles Peterson. Peterson's black and white, uncropped, and sometimes blurry shots of the underground Pacific Northwest music scene's members playing and jamming, wearing their characteristic everyday clothes, were used by Sub Pop to promote its Seattle bands.  Literature  = Zines = Following the 1980s tradition of amateur, fan-produced zines in the punk subculture, members of the grunge scene also produced DIY publications which were \\"distributed at gigs or by mail order\\". The zines were typically photocopied and contained handwritten, \\"hand-colored pages\\", \\"typing errors and grammatical mistakes, misspellings and jumbled pagination\\", all proof of their amateur nature.Leonard, Marion. Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse and Girl Power. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007. p. 140 Backlash was a zine that was published from 1987‚Äì1991 by Dawn Anderson, covering the \\"... dirtier, heavier, more underground and rock side of Seattle's music scene\\", including \\"... punk, metal, underground rock, grunge before it was called grunge and even some local hip-hop.\\" Grunge Gerl #1 was one early 1990s grunge zine, was written by and for riot grrrls in the Los Angeles area. It stated that \\"... we're girls, we're angry, we're powerful.\\" = Local newspapers = In 1992, Rolling Stone music critic Michael Azerrad called The Rocket the Seattle music \\"scene's [most] respected commentator\\". The Rocket was a free newspaper about the Pacific Northwest music scene which was launched in 1979. Edited by Charles R. Cross, the paper only covered \\"fairly obscure alternative bands\\" in the local area, such as The Fartz, The Allies, The Heats/The Heaters, Visible Targets, Red Dress, and The Cowboys.McChesney, Robert W. \\"Balancing Things Left of Center\\", The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7‚Äì21, 1994, p. 12, 14. In the mid-1980s, the paper had stories on Slayer, Wild Dogs, Queensr√øche, and Metal Church. By 1988, the metal scene had faded, and The Rocket's focus shifted to covering the pre-grunge local alternative rock bands. Dawn Anderson states that in 1988, long before any other publication took notice of them, Soundgarden and Nirvana were Rocket cover stars.Anderson, Dawn. \\"Timeline: 1988\\", The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7‚Äì21, 1994, p. 38. In 1991, The Rocket expanded to a Portland, Oregon edition. = Fiction = Grunge lit is an Australian literary genre of fictional or semi-autobiographical writing in the early 1990s about young adults living in an \\"inner cit[y]\\" \\"... world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from ... boredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol\\". Often the central characters are disfranchised, alienated, and lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by \\"new, young authors\\"Leishman, Kirsty, 'Australian Grunge Literature and the Conflict between Literary Generations', Journal of Australian Studies, 23.63 (1999), pp. 94‚Äì102 who examined \\"gritty, dirty, real existences\\" of everyday characters. It has been described as both a sub-set of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature.Vernay, Jean-Fran√ßois, 'Grunge Fiction', The Literary Encyclopedia, November 6, 2008, accessed September 9, 2009 Stuart Glover states that the term \\"grunge lit\\" takes the term \\"grunge\\" from the \\"late '80s and early '90s‚Äî ... Seattle [grunge] bands\\".Glover, Stuart. A Short Note on Grunge Fiction. http://www.stuartglover.com.au/wp- content/uploads/2011/08/A-short-note-on-Grunge-Fiction.pdf Glover states that the term \\"grunge lit\\" was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies; he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as \\"grunge lit\\" writers reject the label. The Australian fiction authors McGahan, McGregor and Tsiolkas criticized the \\"homogenizing effect\\" of conflating such a different group of writers. Tsiolkas called the \\"grunge lit\\" term a \\"media creation\\".  Role of women  Several major grunge bands had female musicians, such as drummer Patty Schemel from Hole. Women had a role in grunge bands such as L7, Lunachicks, Dickless, 7 Year Bitch, The Gits, Courtney Love's band Hole (and Love's other 1990s groups), and Babes in Toyland, the latter an \\"... all-female Minneapolis band\\", and grunge was closely \\"linked with Riot Grrrl\\", an underground feminist punk movement. VH1 writer Dan Tucker stated that L7 was an \\"... all-female grunge band [that] emanated from the fertile L.A. underground scene and [which] had strong ties with ... Black Flag and could match any male band in attitude and volume.\\" Riot Grrrl pioneer and Bikini Kill frontwoman/bassist Kathleen Hanna was closely associated with the Washington state grunge scene. Hanna came up with the name for Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough single, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", a reference to a deodorant marketed specifically to young women.Azerrad, Michael. Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. Doubleday, 1994. , pp. 211‚Äì212 Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists D'arcy Wretzky and Melissa Auf der Maur from The Smashing Pumpkins and drummers Patty Schemel (Hole and Courtney Love projects) and Lori Barbero of Babes in Toyland. The inclusion of women instrumentalists in grunge is notable, because professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in most rock genres.Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. \\"Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music\\" in Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 101-102 As well, women played an active role in the underground grunge scene, such as riot grrrls who produced zines about grunge bands and indie record labels (e.g., Grunge Gerl #1) and Seattle scene leader Dawn Anderson, who wrote for the Seattle fanzine Backlash. Tina Casale was the co-founder of C/Z Records in the 1980s (along with Chris Hanzsek), an indie label that recorded what has been called earliest grunge record, Deep Six, in 1986, which included Soundgarden, the Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, Green River, and the U-Men.  History  = Proto-grunge (1970's-Early 1980's) = Neil Young has been called the \\"Godfather of Grunge\\", and has had albums such as Rust Never Sleeps and Ragged Glory described as proto-grunge and grunge. The term proto-grunge has been used to describe artists as having elements of grunge well before the genre appeared in the mid-late 1980's. Canadian- American musician Neil Young is perhaps the most notable proto-grunge artist. His often distorted, electric guitar playing with his backing band Crazy Horse has earned him the nickname \\"Godfather of Grunge\\". In addition, his albums Rust Never Sleeps (1979) and Ragged Glory (1990) have been proclaimed examples of proto-grunge and grunge music.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music- lists/50-greatest-grunge-albums-798851/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-ragged- glory-1990-798864/ Additionally, he has been cited as an influence by Pearl Jam,http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/35283-pearl-jam-explore-and-not- explodehttps://web.archive.org/web/20140228152554/http://www.kqed.org/support/membership/onq/webexclusives/article- pearljam.jsp which led to them backing Young for the Mirror Ball album, released in 1995. Other acts described as proto-grunge include Wipers and their album Youth of America (1981), Elvis Costello and his Blood & Chocolate album which Will Birch hailed as \\"6 or 8 years ahead of its time\\" (1986), and The Stooges and their album Fun House (1970).https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-grunge- albums-798851/stooges-fun-house-1970-798900/ = 1980‚Äì1985: Roots, predecessors, and influences = Grunge's sound partly resulted from Seattle's isolation from other music scenes. As Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman noted, \\"Seattle was a perfect example of a secondary city with an active music scene that was completely ignored by an American media fixated on Los Angeles and New York [City].\\"Aston, Martin. \\"Freak Scene\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 12. Mark Arm claimed that the isolation meant, \\"this one corner of the map was being really inbred and ripping off each other's ideas\\".Wall, Mick. \\"Northwest Passage\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 9. Seattle \\"... was a remote and provincial city\\" in the 1980s; Bruce Pavitt states that the city was \\"... very working class\\", a place of \\"deprivation\\", and so the scene's \\"... whole aesthetic ‚Äì work clothes, thriftstore truckers' hats, pawnshop guitars\\" was not just a style, it was done because Seattle \\"... was very poor.\\" Indeed, when \\"... Nevermind reached number one in the U.S. charts, Cobain was living in a car.\\" Bands began to mix metal and punk in the Seattle music scene around 1984, with much of the credit for this fusion going to The U-Men.Azerrad (2001), p. 418. However, some critics have noted that in spite of The U-Men's canonical place as original grunge progenitors, that their sound was less indebted to heavy metal and much more akin to However the unique idiosyncrasy of the band may have been the bigger inspiration, more than the aesthetics themselves. Soon Seattle had a growing and \\"varied music scene\\" and \\"diverse urban personality\\" expressed by local \\"post-punk garage bands\\". Grunge evolved from the local punk rock scene, and was inspired by bands such as The Fartz, The U-Men, 10 Minute Warning, The Acc√ºsed, and the Fastbacks. Additionally, the slow, heavy, and sludgy style of the Melvins was a significant influence on the grunge sound.Wall, Mick. \\"Northwest Passage\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 8. Roy Shuker states that grunge's success built on the \\"foundations ... laid throughout the 1980s by earlier alternative music scenes.\\"Shuker, Roy. Understanding Popular Music Culture, 4th Edition. Routledge, 2013. p. 183 Shuker states that music critics \\"... emphasized the perceived purity and authenticity of the Seattle scene. Seattle band The U-Men performing in Seattle Outside the Pacific Northwest, a number of artists and music scenes influenced grunge. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth \\"inadvertently nurtured\\" the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians.Everley, Dave. \\"Daydream Nation\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 39. Nirvana introduced into the Seattle scene the noise-inflected influences of Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers.Azerrad (2001), p. 439. Several Australian bands, including The Scientists, Cosmic Psychos and Feedtime, are cited as precursors to grunge, their music influencing the Seattle scene through the college radio broadcasts of Sub Pop founder Jonathan Poneman and members of Mudhoney.Hennesy, Kate (August 11, 2013). \\"Cosmic Psychos: Uber-blokes punked, pumped and primed\\", The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved October 8, 2015.Rowe, Zan (September 26, 2008). \\"Jonathan Poneman from Sub-Pop takes five with the albums he wishes he'd released...\\" , Mornings with Zan. Retrieved October 8, 2015. The influence of Pixies on Nirvana was noted by Kurt Cobain, who commented in a Rolling Stone interview, \\"I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band‚Äîor at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.\\"Fricke, David. \\"Kurt Cobain: The Rolling Stone Interview\\". Rolling Stone. January 27, 1994. In August 1997, in an interview with Guitar World, Dave Grohl said: \\"From Kurt, Krist [Novoselic] and I liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles and Abba just as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag ... You listen to any Pixies record and it's all over there. Or even Black Sabbath's \\"War Pigs\\"‚Äîit's there: the power of the dynamic. We just sort of abused it with pop songs and got sick with it.\\" Aside from the genre's punk and alternative rock roots, many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal of the early 1970s. Clinton Heylin, author of Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge, cited Black Sabbath as \\"perhaps the most ubiquitous pre-punk influence on the northwest scene\\".Heylin, p. 601. Black Sabbath played a role in shaping the grunge sound, through their own records and the records they inspired.Carden, Andrew. \\"Black Sabbath\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 34. Musicologist Bob Gulla asserted that Black Sabbath's sound \\"shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains\\".Gulla, Bob, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History: The grunge and post-grunge years, 1991‚Äì2005, Greenwood Press, 2006, p. 231. The influence of Led Zeppelin is also evident, particularly in the work of Soundgarden, whom Q magazine noted were \\"in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo\\".Brannigan, Paul. \\"Outshined\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 102. Jon Wiederhorn of Guitar World wrote: \\"So what exactly is grunge? ... Picture a supergroup made up of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath and the Stooges, and you're pretty close.\\" Catherine Strong states that grunge's strongest metal influence was thrash metal, which had a tradition of \\"equality with the audience\\", based on the notion that \\"anyone could start a band\\" (a way of thinking also shared by US hardcore punk, which Strong also cites as an influence on grunge) which was also taken up by grunge bands. Strong states that grunge musicians were opposed to the then-popular \\"hair metal\\" bands. Strong states that \\"... sections of what was [US] hardcore became known as grunge.\\" Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that \\"[t]here is no real difference ... between Punk and Grunge.\\" Like punk bands, grunge groups were \\"embraced as back-to-basics rock 'n' roll bands which reminded the public that the music was supposed to be raw and raunchy\\", and they were a response to \\"bloated and over-the-top ... progressive rock ... or \\"not seriou[s groups] like the hair bands of the '80s.\\" One example of the influence of US hardcore on grunge is the impact that the Los Angeles hardcore punk band Black Flag had on grunge. Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle. Mudhoney's Steve Turner commented, \\"A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great ... we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding.\\"Azerrad, Michael. Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981‚Äì1991. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 2001. , p. 419. Turner explained grunge's integration of metal influences, noting, \\"Hard rock and metal was never that much of an enemy of punk like it was for other scenes. Here, it was like, 'There's only twenty people here, you can't really find a group to hate.'\\" Charles R. Cross states that grunge was the \\"... culmination of twenty years of punk rock\\" development. Cross states that the bands most representing the grunge genre were Seattle bands Blood Circus, TAD, and Mudhoney and Sub Pop's Denver band The Fluid; he states that Nirvana, with its pop influences and blend of Sonic Youth and Cheap Trick, was lighter-sounding than bands like Blood Circus. Cosmic Psychos, one of several Australian bands which influenced and interacted with the Seattle scene Neil Young played a few concerts with Pearl Jam and recorded the album Mirror Ball. This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar‚Äîmost notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps‚Äîbut also his dress and persona.McNair, James. \\"Rust Never Sleeps ‚Äì Neil Young\\". Q: Nirvana and the Story of Grunge. December 2005. p. 36. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, \\"Neurotica was a life changer for me and for a lot of people in the Seattle music community.\\" The context for the development of the Seattle grunge scene was a \\"..golden age of failure, a time when a swath of American youth embraced the ... vices of indolence and lack of motivation\\". The \\"... idlers of Generation X [were] trying to forestall the dread day of corporate enrollment\\" and embrace the \\"cult of the loser\\"; indeed Nirvana's 1991 song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"... opens with Cobain intoning 'It's fun to lose.'\\" The \\"grunge credo was more about a death by slow suffocation\\", a \\"resistance through withdrawal\\" from the world.Huq, Rupa. Beyond Subculture: Pop, Youth and Identity in a Postcolonial World. Routledge, 2007. On page titled \\"soundtracks to Generation X\\" Rupa Huq calls grunge \\"unrelentingly white\\" in \\"timbre and texture\\".Huq, Rupa. Beyond Subculture: Pop, Youth and Identity in a Postcolonial World. Routledge, 2007 On page 2 after page titled \\"soundtracks to Generation X\\" Robert Loss states that while the grunge scene was more welcoming to women than the glam metal world, and while grunge \\"... endeavoured to be more accepting of ethnic and cultural difference, it was overwhelmingly white\\"; he states that hip hop music artists such as Jay-Z had way more \\"crossover\\" appeal to listeners of different races. = 1985‚Äì1989: Early development = Seattle grunge pioneers Green River In 1985, the band Green River released their debut EP Come on Down, which is cited by many as being the very first grunge record. Another seminal release in the development of grunge was the Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records in 1986. The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and The U-Men. For many of them it was their first appearance on record. The artists had \\"a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore\\". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, \\"People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it?' ... People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'\\" Later that year Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation and Green River's Dry As a Bone EP as part of his new label, Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as \\"ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation\\".Azerrad (2001), p. 420. Sub Pop's Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, inspired by other regional music scenes in music history, worked to ensure that their label projected a \\"Seattle sound\\", reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging. While music writer Michael Azerrad acknowledged that early grunge bands like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Tad had disparate sounds, he noted \\"to the objective observer, there were some distinct similarities.\\"Azerrad (2001), pp. 436‚Äì37. Early grunge concerts were sparsely attended (many by fewer than a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create the impression that such concerts were major events.Azerrad (2001), pp. 421‚Äì22. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement.Azerrad (2001), p. 411. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records. Grunge attracted media attention in the United Kingdom after Pavitt and Poneman asked journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker to write an article on the local music scene. This exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows. The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it \\"promised the return to a notion of a regional, authorial vision for American rock\\".Lyons, James. Selling Seattle: Representing Contemporary Urban America. Wallflower, 2004. . pp. 128‚Äì29. Grunge's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands. Mudhoney's Steve Turner said, \\"It was really bad. Pretend bands were popping up here, things weren't coming from where we were coming from.\\"Azerrad (2001), p. 449. As a reaction, many grunge bands diversified their sound, with Nirvana and Tad in particular creating more melodic songs.Azerrad (2001), p. 450. Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the Seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated. Chris Dubrow from The Guardian states that in the late 1980s, Australia's \\"sticky-floored ... alternative pub scene\\" in seedy inner-city areas produced grunge bands with \\"raw and awkward energy\\" such as The Scientists, X, Beasts of Bourbon, feedtime, Cosmic Psychos and Lubricated Goat. Dubrow said \\"Cobain ... admitted the Australian wave was a big influence\\" on his music. Everett True states that \\"[t]here's more of an argument to be had for grunge beginning in Australia with the Scientists and their scrawny punk ilk.\\"True, Everett. \\"Ten Myths about Grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain\\". The Guardian. August 24, 2011 = Early‚Äìmid 1990s: Mainstream success = Nirvana performing at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards Grunge bands had made inroads to the musical mainstream in the late 1980s. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when they joined the roster of A&M; Records in 1989. Soundgarden, along with other major label signings Alice in Chains and Screaming Trees, performed \\"okay\\" with their initial major label releases, according to Jack Endino. Nirvana, originally from Aberdeen, Washington, was also courted by major labels, while releasing its first album Bleach in 1989. Nirvana got signed by Geffen Records in 1990. Alice in Chains signed with Columbia Records in 1989, and their debut album, Facelift, was released on August 21, 1990. The album's second single, \\"Man in the Box\\", was released in January 1991, spent 20 weeks on the Top 20 of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and its music video received heavy rotation on MTV. Facelift became the first album from the grunge movement to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 11, 1991, for selling over 500,000 copies. In September 1991, Nirvana released its major label debut, Nevermind. The album was at best hoped to be a minor success on par with Sonic Youth's Goo, which Geffen had released a year earlier.Wice, Nathaniel. \\"How Nirvana Made It\\". Spin. April 1992. It was the release of the album's first single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" that \\"marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon\\". Due to constant airplay of the song's music video on MTV, Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991,Lyons, p. 120 and was certified gold on November 27, 1991. In January 1992, Nevermind replaced pop superstar Michael Jackson's Dangerous at number one on the Billboard 200.\\"The Billboard 200\\". Billboard. Prometheus Global Media. January 11, 1992. Nevermind was certified diamond by the RIAA in 1999. The success of Nevermind surprised the music industry. Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established \\"the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.\\" Michael Azerrad asserted that Nevermind symbolized \\"a sea-change in rock music\\" in which the glam metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was perceived as authentic and culturally relevant.Azerrad (1994), pp. 229‚Äì30. Grunge made it possible for genres thought to be of a niche audience, no matter how radical, to prove their marketability and be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture. Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. Pearl Jam, which featured former Mother Love Bone members Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, had released its debut album Ten in August 1991, a month before Nevermind, but album sales only picked up the following year. By the second half of 1992 Ten had become a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts.Pearlman, Nina. \\"Black Days\\". Guitar World. December 2002. Ten by Pearl Jam was certified 13x platinum by the RIAA. The band Soundgarden's album Badmotorfinger and the band Alice in Chains' album Dirt, along with the band Temple of the Dog's self-titled album, a collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top selling albums of 1992.Lyons, p. 136. The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle \\"the new Liverpool\\". Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success.Azerrad (2001), pp. 452‚Äì53. The grunge scene was the backdrop in the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles. There were several small roles, performances, and cameos in the film by popular Seattle grunge bands including Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. Filmed in and around Seattle in 1991, the film was not released until 1992 during the height of grunge popularity. The popularity of grunge resulted in a large interest in the Seattle music scene's perceived cultural traits. While the Seattle music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s in actuality consisted of various styles and genres of music, its representation in the media \\"served to depict Seattle as a music 'community' in which the focus was upon the ongoing exploration of one musical idiom, namely grunge\\".Lyons, p. 122. The fashion industry marketed \\"grunge fashion\\" to consumers, charging premium prices for items such as knit ski hats and plaid shirts. Critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. Entertainment Weekly commented in a 1993 article, \\"There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s\\". Marketers used the \\"grunge\\" concept to sell grunge air freshener, grunge hair gel and even CDs of \\"easy-listening music\\" called \\"grunge light\\". The New York Times compared the \\"grunging of America\\" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years. Ironically the New York Times was tricked into printing a fake list of slang terms that were supposedly used in the grunge scene; often referred to as the grunge speak hoax. This media hype surrounding grunge was documented in the 1996 documentary Hype!. As mass media began to use the term \\"grunge\\" in any news story about the key bands, Seattle scene members began to refer to the term as \\"the G-word\\". Grunge band Pearl Jam in Columbia, Maryland in 2000 A backlash against grunge began to develop in Seattle; in late 1992, Jonathan Poneman said that in the city, \\"All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [. . .] Because the whole thing is a fabricated movement and always has been.\\" Grunge and grunge bands received criticism from musicians such as Blur's Damon Albarn, who was quoted saying \\"fuck grunge\\" and \\"The Smashing Pumpkins can kiss my fucking ass\\" while performing onstage. Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"Famous is the last thing I wanted to be.\\"Azerrad, Michael. Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. Doubleday, 1994. , p. 254. Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder. Nirvana's follow- up album In Utero (1993) featured an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a \\"wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record\\".DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. , p. 18. Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993, In Utero topped the Billboard charts. In 1996, In Utero was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, Vs. (1993). The album sold a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release, topped the Billboard charts, and outperformed all other entries in the top ten that week combined. In 1993, the grunge band Candlebox released their self-titled album, which was certified by the RIAA. In February 1994, Alice in Chains' EP, Jar of Flies peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.Alice in Chains ‚Äì Billboard 200 chart history billboard.com. Retrieved August 1, 2016. Soundgarden's album Superunknown, which was also released in 1994, peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart,Soundgarden ‚Äì Billboard 200 chart history billboard.com. Retrieved August 1, 2016. and was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. In 1995, Alice in Chains' self-titled album became their second number 1 album on the Billboard 200, and was certified 2x platinum. At the height of grunge's commercial success in the early 1990s, the commercial success of grunge put record labels on a nationwide search for undiscovered talent to promote. This included San Diego, California-based Stone Temple Pilots, Texas-based Tripping Daisy and Toadies, Paw, Chicago- based Veruca Salt, and Australian band Silverchair, bands whose early work continues to be identified broadly (if not in Seattle itself) as \\"grunge\\". In 2014, Paste ranked Veruca Salt's \\"All Hail Me\\" #39 and Silverchair's \\"Tomorrow\\" #45 on their list of the 50 best grunge songs of all time. Loudwire named Stone Temple Pilots one of the ten best grunge bands of all time. Grunge bands outside of the United States emerged in several countries. In Canada, Eric's Trip, the first Canadian band signed by the Sub Pop label, has been classified as grunge Barclay, Michael; Schneider, Jason; Jack, Ian. Have Not Been the Same: The CanRock Renaissance, 1985‚Äì1995. ECW Press, 2011 and Nickelback's debut album was considered to be grunge. Silverchair achieved mainstream success in the 1990s; the band's song \\"Tomorrow\\" went to number 22 on the Radio Songs chart in September 1995 and the band's debut album Frogstomp, released in June 1995, was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in February 1996. During this period, grunge bands that were not from Seattle were often panned by critics, who accused them of being bandwagon-jumpers. Grunge band Stone Temple Pilots in particular fell victim to this. In a January 1994 Rolling Stone poll, Stone Temple Pilots was simultaneously voted \\"Best New Band\\" by Rolling Stone readers and \\"Worst New Band\\" by the magazine's music critics, highlighting the disparity between critics and fans. Stone Temple Pilots became very popular; their album Core was certified 8x platinum by RIAA and their album Purple was certified 6x platinum by the RIAA. The British grunge band Bush released their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994. In a review of their second album Razorblade Suitcase, Rolling Stone criticized the album and called Bush \\"the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's music\\". In the book Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota, Chuck Klosterman wrote, \\"Bush was a good band who just happened to signal the beginning of the end; ultimately, they would become the grunge Warrant\\". In the book Accidental Revolution: The Story of Grunge, Kyle Anderson wrote: = Mid‚Äìlate 1990s: Decline of mainstream popularity =  End of subculture  A number of factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. Critics and historians do not agree on the exact point that grunge ended.DiBlasi, Alex. \\"Grunge\\" in Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars and Stories that Shaped Our Culture, p. 520-524. Edited by Jacqueline Edmondson. ABC-CLIO, 2013. p. 523 Catherine Strong states that \\"... at the end of 1993 ... [,]grunge had become unstable, and was entering the first stages of being killed off\\"; she points out that the \\"... scene had become so successful\\" and widely known that \\"imitators had begun to enter the field\\".Strong, Catherine. Grunge: Music and Memory. Routledge, 2016. p.55 Paste magazine states by 1994, grunge \\"... was fading fast\\", with \\"... Pearl Jam retreating from the spotlight as fast as they could; Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and hordes of others were battling horrid drug addictions and struggling for survival.\\" In Grunge: Seattle, Justin Henderson states that the \\"downward spiral\\" began in mid-1994, as the influx of major label money into the scene changed the culture and it had \\"nowhere to go but down\\"; he states the death of Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff on June 16, 1994, from a heroin overdose, was \\"another nail in grunge's coffin.\\" Henderson, Justin. Grunge: Seattle. Roaring Forties Press, 2016. Ch. 6 In Jason Heller's 2013 article \\"Did grunge really matter?\\", in A.V. CLUB, he stated that Nirvana's In Utero (September 1993) was \\"grunge's death knell. As soon as Cobain grumbled, \\"Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I'm bored and old,\\" it was all over.\\" Heller states that after Cobain's death in 1994, the \\"hypocrisy\\" in the grunge of the time \\"became ... glaring\\" and \\"idealism became embarrassing\\", with the result being that \\"grunge became the new [mainstream] Aerosmith\\". Heller states that \\"grunge became an evolutionary dead end\\", because \\"it stood for nothing and was built on nothing, and that ethos of negation was all it was about.\\" During the mid-1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was found dead in his Seattle home from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Nirvana summarily disbanded. After Cobain's death, Bruce Hardy wrote in Time magazine that he was \\"the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest\\", that he had struggled with a heroin addiction, and claimed that during the last weeks of his life there had been rumors in the music industry that Cobain had suffered a drug overdose and that Nirvana was breaking up. Cobain's suicide \\"served as a catalyst for grunge's ... demise\\", because it \\"... deflated the energy from grunge and provided the opening for saccharine and corporate-formulated music to regain\\" its lost footing.\\" That same year Pearl Jam canceled its summer tour in protest of ticket vendor Ticketmaster's unfair business practices. Pearl Jam then began a boycott of the company; however, Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented the band from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.DeRogatis, p. 65. In 1996, Alice in Chains gave their final performances with their ailing and estranged lead singer, Layne Staley, who subsequently died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin in 2002. In 1996, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees released their final studio albums of the 1990s, Down on the Upside and Dust, respectively. Strong states that Roy Shuker and Stout have written that the \\"... end of grunge\\" can be seen as being \\"... as late as the breakup of Soundgarden in 1997\\".  Post-grunge  British band Bush were described by Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone as \\"the most successful and shameless mimics of Nirvana's music\\". During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge, which remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century. Post-grunge \\"... transformed the thick guitar sounds and candid lyrical themes of the Seattle bands into an accessible, often uplifting mainstream aesthetic\\".Post- Grunge: A History of Post-Grunge Rock http://rock.about.com/od/rockmusic101/a/PostGrunge.htm These artists were seen as lacking the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely \\"a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious- minded hard rock\\". was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production. When grunge became a mainstream genre, major labels started signing bands that sounded similar to these bands' sonic identities. Bands labeled as that emerged when grunge was mainstream such as Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul all are noted for emulating the sound of the bands that launched grunge into the mainstream. Although the bands Bush and Candlebox have been categorized as grunge, both bands have been largely categorized as too. In 1995, SPIN writer Charles Aaron stated that with grunge \\"spent\\", pop punk in a slump, Britpop a \\"giddy memory\\" and album-oriented rock over, the music industry turned to \\"Corporate[-produced] Alternative\\", which he calls \\"soundalike fake grunge\\" or \\"scrunge\\".Charles, Aaron. \\"Singles\\". SPIN. November 1995. p. 131 Bands Aaron lists as \\"scrunge\\" groups include: Better Than Ezra; Bush; Collective Soul; Garbage; Hootie & the Blowfish; Hum; Silverchair; Sponge; Tripping Daisy; Jennifer Trynin and Weezer; Aaron includes the Foo Fighters in his list, but states that Dave Grohl avoided becoming a \\"scrunge fall gu[y]\\" by combining 1980s hardcore punk with 1970s arena trash music in his post-Nirvana group. Bands described as grunge like Bush and Candlebox also have been largely categorized as These two bands became popular after 1992. Other bands categorized as post-grunge that emerged when Bush and Candlebox became popular include Collective Soul and Live. still was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s with newer bands such as Creed, Nickelback, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd. Other bands include Foo Fighters, Staind and Matchbox Twenty. These post-grunge artists were criticized for their commercialized sound as well as their \\"worldview built around the comforts of community and romantic relationships\\", as opposed to grunge's lyrical exploration of \\"troubling issues such as suicide, societal hypocrisy and drug addiction.\\" Adam Steininger criticized post-grunge bands' \\"diluted ditties filled with watered- down lyrics, all seemingly revolving around suffering through romance.\\" Criticizing many bands that have been described as post-grunge, Steininger criticized Candlebox for their \\"pop-filled\\" sound, focus on \\"love lyrics, and writing songs without \\"versatility and creativity; Three Days Grace for their \\"diluted\\" and \\"radio-friendly music\\"; 3 Doors Down for focusing on \\"... snagging hit singles instead of creating quality albums\\"; Finger Eleven for going in a \\"pop rock\\" direction; Bush's \\"random phrasings of nonsense\\"; Live's \\"pseudo pop poetry\\" that \\"strangled the essence of grunge\\", Puddle of Mudd's \\"watered down post-grunge sound\\"; Lifehouse, for tearing \\"... down ... grunge's sound and groundbreaking structure to appeal more to the masses\\"; and Nickelback, which he calls the \\"featherweight ... punching bags of post- grunge\\" whose music is \\"dull as dishwater\\".  Reaction by Britpop  Britpop band Oasis performing in Canada in 2002 Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, emerged in part as a reaction against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by \\"youthful exuberance and desire for recognition\\". The leading Britpop bands, \\"Blur and Oasis[,] exist[ed] as reactionary forces to [grunge's] eternal downcast glare.\\" Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, \\"Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.\\"Harris, p. 79. Britpop artists were vocal about their disdain for grunge. In a 1993 NME interview, Damon Albarn of Britpop band Blur agreed with interviewer John Harris' assertion that Blur was an \\"anti-grunge band\\", and said, \\"Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge\\" (ironically Kurt Cobain once cited Blur as his favorite band).Harris, John. \\"A shite sports car and a punk reincarnation\\". NME. April 10, 1993. Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single \\"Live Forever\\" \\"was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' and I was like ... 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [Cobain] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack [heroin], fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish.\\"\\"Lock the Door\\". Stop the Clocks [bonus DVD]. Columbia, 2006. = 2000s‚Äì2010s: Revival = Many major grunge bands have continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s and 2010s. Perhaps the most notable grunge act of the 21st century has been Pearl Jam. In 2006 Rolling Stone writer Brian Hiatt described Pearl Jam as having \\"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame\\", he noted the band developed a loyal concert following akin to that of the Grateful Dead. They saw a return to wide commercial success with 2006's Pearl Jam, 2009's Backspacer and 2013's Lightning Bolt. Alice In Chains reformed for a handful of reunion dates in 2005 with several different vocalists replacing Layne Staley. Eventually settling on William Duvall as Staley's replacement, in 2009 they released Black Gives Way to Blue, their first record in 14 years. The band's 2013 release, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, reached number 2 on the Billboard 200. Soundgarden reformed in 2010 and released their album King Animal two years later which reached the top five of the national albums charts in Denmark, New Zealand, and the United States. Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd joined Alain Johannes (Queens of the Stone Age, Eleven), Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age) and Dimitri Coats (Off!) to form side project Ten Commandos in 2016. Despite Kurt Cobain's death, the remaining members of Nirvana have continued to be successful posthumously. Due to the high sales for Kurt Cobain's Journals and the band's best-of compilation Nirvana upon their releases in 2002, The New York Times argued Nirvana \\"are having more success now than at any point since Mr. Cobain's suicide in 1994.\\" This trend has continued through the century's second decade, with the reissuing of the band's discography and release of the authorized documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. In 2012, the surviving members of Nirvana re-united, with Paul McCartney in place of Cobain, to record a track for the soundtrack Dave Grohl's documentary Sound City titled \\"Cut Me Some Slack\\". One of the most successful rock groups of the 21st Century, Queens of the Stone Age, has featured major contributions from various grunge musicians. Josh Homme had briefly played in Screaming Trees with off-and-on QOTSA member Mark Lanegan, before forming the group. Nirvana's Dave Grohl and Eleven's Alain Johannes have also provided notable contributions. Homme and Grohl joined with Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones to form the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures in 2009. Johannes also performed with the group as a touring member. Australian singer-songwriter and guitarist Courtney Barnett in 2015 In the early 2000s, grunge would make multiple regionally based resurgences, albeit minor ones. In 2005, The Seattle Times made note of groups returning in the Seattle scene. Similarly, The Guardian reported of grunge-influenced groups from Yorkshire, including Dinosaur Pile-Up, Pulled Apart by Horses, and Wonderswan. Also, in 2003, the New York Times noted a resurgence in grunge fashion. The 2010s have birthed a number of bands influenced by grunge. Unlike their forebears, some of these acts ascribe the label to themselves willingly. Many acts have been noted for affiliating and/or collaborating with prominent figures from the original alternative rock era. Steve Albini has produced for or worked with members of bands such as Bully, Vomitface, and Shannon Wright, while Emma Ruth Rundle of Marriages has toured with Buzz Osborne of the Melvins. Other notable acts that have been labelled as grunge or as heavily influenced by the grunge era, include Courtney Barnett, Wolf Alice, Yuck, Speedy Ortiz, The Kut, Mitski, 2:54, False Advertising, Slothrust, Baby in Vain, Big Thief, Torres., Lullwater, and Red Sun Rising. Media outlets also began referring to a revival of the grunge sound around the mid-2010s, with the label being given to bands such as Title Fight, InCrest, Fangclub, Code Orange, My Ticket Home, Citizen, Milk Teeth and Muskets, some of which have been described as merging the genre with emo.  Legacy  This photo of a Mudhoney concert captures some of the band's live show energy. In 2011, music critic Dave Whitaker wrote that each generation from the start of \\"... recorded music has introduced a game- changing genre\\", from swing music in the 1930s, rock and roll in the 1950s, punk rock in the 1970s and then grunge in the 1990s. However, he states \\"grunge was the last American musical revolution\\", as no post-grunge generation has introduced a new genre which radically changed the music scene. He states that the \\"digital revolution\\" [(online music, file sharing, etc.]) has meant that there has not been a \\"... generation-defining genre since grunge\\", because, for \\"one genre to so completely saturate the market requires ... a music industry with immense control over the market\\". In 2016, Rob Zombie stated that grunge caused the death of the \\"rock star\\"; he states that unlike previous stars like \\"... Alice Cooper and Gene Simmons and Elton John\\", who \\"... might as well have been from another fuckin' planet\\", with grunge, the attitude was \\"[we] need all our rock stars to look just like us.\\" Bob Batchelor states that the indie record mindset and values in Seattle which provided guidance for the development and emergence of Nirvana and Pearl Jam \\"... conflicted with the major recording label desire to sell millions of CDs.\\" Batchelor also states that despite grunge musicians' discomfort with the major labels' commercial goals, and the resistance by some key bands to do the promotional activities required by the labels, including music videos, MTV's video programs \\"... played an instrumental role in making [grunge]\\" become \\"... mainstream, since many music fans received their first exposure\\" on MTV, rather than on local or \\"niche radio.\\" Gil Troy states that the \\"... grunge rebellion, like most others\\" in America's \\"consumerist\\" culture, ended up being \\"commodified, mass-produced, ritualized, and thus sanitized\\" by major corporations.Troy, Gil. The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s.Macmillan, 2015. p. 106 In 2011, John Calvert stated that \\"timing\\" is the reason why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the cultural mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present. Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the \\"... context and history of how it all came to be\\" and \\"... respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [in Seattle,] because you probably won't see anything like it again.\\" Paste magazine's Michael Danaher states that the grunge \\"... movement changed the course of rock 'n' roll, bringing ... tales of abuse and depression\\" and socially conscious issues\\" into pop culture. Calvert stated that Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" has an \\"iconic place in history\\" as it had \\"generation-defining resonance\\" for young people from its era\\"; he states that \\"no other band ... made the urge to self-destruct ... as listenable\\", with \\"authentic\\" pain and \\"disaffection. Calvert also calls the record \\"chart history's most ferocious, dark and intense\\" music since early punk rock, and he says it was \\"heavy when heavy was needed\\" by young people of that era, \\"jarr[ing] young America awake\\" and giving them something to \\"cling to\\" in difficult times. A 2017 book stated that grunge \\"..forever changed the identity of rock music in a way analogous to punk\\"; moreover, grunge added \\"introspective\\" lyrics about \\"existential authenticity\\" and \\"what it means to be true to oneself\\". Grunge's Kurt Cobain has been called the \\"voice of Generation X\\", playing the same role for this demographic as Bob Dylan played for 1960s youth and that John Lennon played for the 1970s generation. Bob Batchelor states that Nirvana was \\"as important as Elvis or the Beatles.\\" In 2008, Darragh McManus of The Guardian states that grunge was not simply a young person's trend or a musical fad; she states that grunge synthesized the key philosophies of the modern era, from \\"Feminism, liberalism, irony, apathy, cynicism/idealism ... , anti-authoritarianism, [to] wry post-modernism\\". McManus states that grunge dealt with serious, \\"weighty\\" topics, which does not occur often in popular music. McManus stated that for Generation X, grunge was not just music, it was a key cultural influence. Marlen Komar states that Nirvana's success popularized \\"non-heterosexist\\", non-binary ways of thinking about \\"gender and sexuality\\", emphasized how men and women were alike and promoted progressive political thinking.

Dictionary of Visual Science. 4th ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997. or iridiagnosis) is an alternative medicine technique whose proponents claim that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's systemic health. Practitioners match their observations to iris charts, which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body. Iridologists see the eyes as \\"windows\\" into the body's state of health. Iridologists claim they can use the charts to distinguish between healthy systems and organs in the body and those that are overactive, inflamed, or distressed. Iridologists claim this information demonstrates a patient's susceptibility towards certain illnesses, reflects past medical problems, or predicts later health problems. As opposed to evidence-based medicine, iridology is not supported by quality research studies and is considered pseudoscience. The features of the iris are one of the most stable features on the human body throughout life. The stability of iris structures is the foundation of the biometric technology which uses iris recognition for identification purposes. In 1979, Bernard Jensen, a leading American iridologist, and two other iridology proponents failed to establish the basis of their practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not. Methods iris is the greenish-yellow area surrounding the transparent pupil (showing as black). The white outer area is the sclera, the central transparent part of which is the cornea. Iridologists generally use equipment such as a flashlight and magnifying glass, cameras or slit-lamp microscopes to examine a patient's irises for tissue changes, as well as features such as specific pigment patterns and irregular stromal architecture. The markings and patterns are compared to an iris chart that correlates zones of the iris with parts of the body. Typical charts divide the iris into approximately 80‚Äì90 zones. For example, the zone corresponding to the kidney is in the lower part of the iris, just before 6 o'clock. There are minor variations between charts' associations between body parts and areas of the iris. According to iridologists, details in the iris reflect changes in the tissues of the corresponding body organs. One prominent practitioner, Bernard Jensen, described it thus: \\"Nerve fibers in the iris respond to changes in body tissues by manifesting a reflex physiology that corresponds to specific tissue changes and locations.\\"Jensen B; \\"Iridology Simplified\\". 2nd ed., Escondido 1980. This would mean that a bodily condition translates to a noticeable change in the appearance of the iris, but this has been disproven through many studies. (See section on Scientific research.) For example, acute inflammatory, chronic inflammatory and catarrhal signs may indicate involvement, maintenance, or healing of corresponding distant tissues, respectively. Other features that iridologists look for are contraction rings and Klumpenzellen, which may indicate various other health conditions, as interpreted in context. History The first explicit description of iridological principles such as homolaterality (without using the word iridology) are found in Chiromatica Medica, a famous work published in 1665 and reprinted in 1670 and 1691 by Philippus Meyeus (Philip Meyen von Coburg). This is an example of an iridology chart, correlating areas of the left iris, as seen in the mirror, with portions of the left hand side of the body. Changes in color or appearance of the iris are said to indicate changes in the health of the corresponding section of the body. This is the corresponding chart for the right iris, which relates to the right side of the body. The first use of the word Augendiagnostik (\\"eye diagnosis\\", loosely translated as iridology) began with Ignaz von Peczely, a 19th-century Hungarian physician who is recognised as its founding father. The most common story is that he got the idea for this diagnostic tool after seeing similar streaks in the eyes of a man he was treating for a broken leg and the eyes of an owl whose leg von Peczely had broken many years before. At the First International Iridological Congress, Ignaz von Peczely's nephew, August von Peczely, dismissed this myth as apocryphal, and maintained that such claims were irreproducible. The second 'father' to iridology is thought to be Nils Liljequist from Sweden, who greatly suffered from the outgrowth of his lymph nodes. After a round of medication made from iodine and quinine, he observed many differences in the colour of his iris. This observation inspired him to create and publish an atlas in 1893, which contained 258 black and white illustrations and 12 colour illustrations of the iris, known as the Diagnosis of the Eye. The German contribution in the field of natural healing is due to a minister Pastor Emanuel Felke, who developed a form of homeopathy for treating specific illnesses and described new iris signs in the early 1900s. However, Pastor Felke was subject to long and bitter litigation. The Felke Institute in Gerlingen, Germany, was established as a leading center of iridological research and training. Iridology became better known in the United States in the 1950s, when Bernard Jensen, an American chiropractor, began giving classes in his own method. This is in direct relationship with P. Johannes Thiel, Eduard Lahn (who became an American under the name of Edward Lane) and J Haskell Kritzer. Jensen emphasized the importance of the body's exposure to toxins, and the use of natural foods as detoxifiers. Criticism The majority of medical doctors reject all the claims of all branches of iridology and label them as pseudoscience or even quackery. Critics, including most practitioners of medicine, dismiss iridology given that published studies have indicated a lack of success for its claims. To date, clinical data does not support correlation between illness in the body and coinciding observable changes in the iris. In controlled experiments, practitioners of iridology have performed statistically no better than chance in determining the presence of a disease or condition solely through observation of the iris. It has been pointed out that the premise of iridology is at odds with the fact that the iris does not undergo substantial changes in an individual's life. Iris texture is a phenotypical feature that develops during gestation and remains unchanged after birth. There is no evidence for changes in the iris pattern other than variations in pigmentation in the first year of life and variations caused by glaucoma treatment. The stability of iris structures is the foundation of the biometric technology which uses iris recognition for identification purposes. Scientific research into iridology Well- controlled scientific evaluation of iridology has shown entirely negative results, with all rigorous double blind tests failing to find any statistical significance to its claims. In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. Iridology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. A German study from 1957 which took more than 4,000 iris photographs of more than 1,000 people concluded that iridology was not useful as a diagnostic tool. In 1979, Bernard Jensen, a leading American iridologist, and two other iridology proponents failed to establish the basis of their practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not. One iridologist, for example, decided that 88% of the normal patients had kidney disease, while another judged through his iris analysis that 74% of patients who needed artificial kidney treatment were normal. Another study was published in the British Medical Journal which selected 39 patients who were due to have their gall bladder removed the following day, because of suspected gallstones. The study also selected a group of people who did not have diseased gall bladders to act as a control. A group of 5 iridologists examined a series of slides of both groups' irises. The iridologists could not correctly identify which patients had gall bladder problems and which had healthy gall bladders. For example, one of the iridologists diagnosed 49% of the patients with gall stones as having them and 51% as not having them. The author concluded:, \\"...this study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic aid.\\" Edzard Ernst raised the question in 2000: \\"Does iridology work? [...] This search strategy resulted in 77 publications on the subject of iridology. [...] All of the uncontrolled studies and several of the unmasked experiments suggested that iridology was a valid diagnostic tool. The discussion that follows refers to the 4 controlled, masked evaluations of the diagnostic validity of iridology. [...] In conclusion, few controlled studies with masked evaluation of diagnostic validity have been published. None have found any benefit from iridology.\\" A 2005 study tested the usefulness of iridology in diagnosing common forms of cancer. An experienced iridology practitioner examined the eyes of 110 total subjects, of which 68 people had proven cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus, prostate, or colorectum, and 42 for whom there was no medical evidence of cancer. The practitioner, who was unaware of their gender or medical details, was asked to suggest a diagnosis for each person and his results were then compared with each subject's known medical diagnosis. The study conclusion was that \\"Iridology was of no value in diagnosing the cancers investigated in this study.\\" Regulation, licensure, and certification In Canada and the United States, iridology is not regulated or licensed by any governmental agency. Numerous organizations offer certification courses. Possible harms Medical errors‚Äîtreatment for conditions diagnosed via this method which do not actually exist (false positive result) or a false sense of security when a serious condition is not diagnosed by this method (false negative result)‚Äîcould lead to improper or delayed treatment and even loss of life.

This may result in the adoption of a new policy or specific law. In some countries, it is synonymous with a plebiscite or a vote on a ballot question. Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. The word, 'referendum' is often a catchall, used for both legislative referrals and initiatives. In Australia, a 'referendum' is often said to be a vote to change the federal constitution and 'plebiscite' a vote which does not affect the federal constitution. However, this is erroneous as not all federal referendums have been on constitutional matters (such as the 1916 Australian conscription referendum), and state votes that likewise do not affect either the federal or state constitution are frequently said to be referendums (such as the 2009 Western Australian daylight saving referendum). Historically, they are used by Australians interchangeably and a plebiscite was considered another name for a referendum. In Ireland, 'plebiscite' referred to the vote to adopt its constitution, but a subsequent vote to amend the constitution is called a 'referendum', as is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill. Etymology and plural form 'Referendum' is the gerundive form of the Latin verb refero, literally \\"to carry back\\" (from the verb fero, \\"to bear, bring, carry\\"Marchant & Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p.221 plus the inseparable prefix re-, here meaning \\"back\\"Marchant & Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p. 469.). As a gerundive is an adjective,A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) not a noun,A gerund is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (referre) serves the purpose it cannot be used alone in Latin, and must be contained within a context attached to a noun such as Propositum quod referendum est populo, \\"A proposal which must be carried back to the people\\". The addition of the verb sum (3rd person singular, est) to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which \\"must\\" be done, rather than that which is \\"fit for\\" doing. Its use as a noun in English is not considered a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be \\"referendums\\". The use of \\"referenda\\" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is unsupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar. The use of \\"referenda\\" as a plural form is posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the Oxford English Dictionary, which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:Oxford English Dictionary Referendum > Referendums is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one > issue' (as a Latin gerund,a gerund is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin > Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an > infinitive (referre) serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, > dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. > 91-2.) referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', > meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of > issues.i.e. Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo, \\"Proposals which must be > carried back to the people\\" It is closely related to agenda, \\"those matters which must be driven forward\\", from ago, to drive (cattle); and memorandum, \\"that matter which must be remembered\\", from memoro, to call to mind, corrigenda, from rego, to rule, make straight, those things which must be made straight (corrected), etc.  Earliest use  The name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden as early as the 16th century.Barber, Benjamin R.. The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.Vincent, J.M.. State and Federal Government in Switzerland, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p. 122 The term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin plebiscita, which originally meant a decree of the Concilium Plebis (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the Roman Republic. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example, Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution. In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred. Types of Referendums The term referendum covers a variety of different meanings. A referendum can be binding or advisory. In some countries, different names are used for these two types of referendum. Referendums can be further classified by who initiates them. = Mandatory Referendums = A mandatory referendum is a automatically put to a vote if certain conditions are met and do not require any signatures from the public or legislative action. In areas that use referendums a mandatory referendum is commonly used as a legally required step for ratification for constitutional changes, ratifying international treaties and joining international organizations, and certain types of public spending.  Constitutional Changes  Some countries or local governments choose to enact any constitutional amendments with a mandatory referendum. These include Australia, Ireland, Switzerland, Denmark, and 49 of 50 U.S States (the only exception being Delaware).  Financial Decisions  Many localities have a mandatory referendum in order for the government to issue certain bonds, raise taxes above a specified amount, or take on certain amounts of debt. In California, the state government may not borrow more than $300,000 without a public voter in a statewide bond proposition.  International Relations  Switzerland has mandatory referendums on enacting international treaties that have to do with collective security and joining a supranational community. This type of referendum has only occurred once in the country's history, a failed attempt in 1986 for Switzerland to join the United Nations.  War Referendum  A hypothetical type of referendum, first proposed by Immanuel Kant, is a referendum to approve a declaration of war in a war referendum. It has never been enacted by any country, but was debated in the United States in the 1930s as the Ludlow Amendment. = Optional Referendums = An optional referendum is a question that is put to the vote as a result of a demand. This may come from the executive branch, legislative branch, or a request from the people (often after meeting a signature requirement).  Voluntary Referendum  Voluntary referendums, also known as a legislative referral, are initiated by the legislature or government. These may be advisory questions to gauge public opinion or binding questions of law.  Initiative  An initiative is a citizen led process to propose or amend laws or constitutional amendments, which are voted on in a referendum.  Popular Referendum  A popular referendum is a vote to strike down an existing law or part of an existing law.  Recall Referendum  A recall referendum (also known as a recall election) is a procedure to remove officials before the end of their term of office. Depending on the area and position a recall may be for a specific individual, such as an individual legislator, or more general such as an entire legislature. In the U.S States of Arizona, Montana, and Nevada, the recall may be used against any public official at any level of government including both elected and appointed officials.  Independence Referendum  Some territories may hold referendums on whether to become independent sovereign states. These types of referendums may legally sanction and binding, such as the 2011 referendum for the independence of South Sudan, or in some cases may not be sanctioned and considered illegal, such as the 2017 referendum for the independence of Catalonia. A deliberative referendum is a referendum specifically designed to improve the deliberative qualities of the campaign preceding the referendum vote, and/or of the act of voting itself. Rationale From a political- philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of direct democracy, but today, most referendums need to be understood within the context of representative democracy. They tend to be used quite selectively, covering issues such as changes in voting systems, where currently elected officials may not have the legitimacy or inclination to implement such changes. Referendums by country Since the end of the 18th century, hundreds of national referendums have been organised in the world; Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, Le bonheur. L'approche √©conomique, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes, 2013 (). almost 600 national votes were held in Switzerland since its inauguration as a modern state in 1848. Italy ranked second with 72 national referendums: 67 popular referendums (46 of which were proposed by the Radical Party), 3 constitutional referendums, one institutional referendum and one advisory referendum. Multiple-choice referendums A referendum usually offers the electorate a choice of accepting or rejecting a proposal, but not always. Some referendums give voters the choice among multiple choices and some use transferable voting. In Switzerland, for example, multiple choice referendums are common. Two multiple choice referendums were held in Sweden, in 1957 and in 1980, in which voters were offered three options. In 1977, a referendum held in Australia to determine a new national anthem was held in which voters had four choices. In 1992, New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system. In 1982, Guam had referendum that used six options, with an additional blank option for those wishing to (campaign and) vote for their own seventh option. A multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is to be determined. They may be set up so that if no single option receives the support of an absolute majority (more than half) of the votes, resort can be made to the two-round system or instant-runoff voting, which is also called IRV and PV. In 2018 the Irish Citizens' Assembly considered the conduct of future referendums in Ireland, with 76 of the members in favour of allowing more than two options, and 52% favouring preferential voting in such cases. Other people regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the Modified Borda Count (MBC) as more inclusive and more accurate. Swiss referendums offer a separate vote on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case, in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the Single Member Plurality (\\"first past the post\\") system. In other words, the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a plurality, rather than an absolute majority, of voters. In the 1977, Australian referendum, the winner was chosen by the system of preferential instant-runoff voting (IRV). Polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example, were counted under a form of the two-round system, and an unusual form of TRS was used in the 1992 New Zealand poll. Although California has not held multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that conflicts arise. The State's Constitution provides a method for resolving conflicts when two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This is a de facto form of approval voting‚Äîi.e. the proposition with the most \\"yes\\" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict. Another voting system that could be used in multiple-choice referendum is the Condorcet rule. Criticisms =Criticism of populist aspect= Pro-Russian protesters in Odessa, Ukraine, demanding a referendum, March 30, 2014 2015 Greek bailout referendum Demonstration for \\"NO\\" vote Syntagma square Athens, Greece Critics of the referendum argue that voters in a referendum are more likely to be driven by transient whims than by careful deliberation, or that they are not sufficiently informed to make decisions on complicated or technical issues. Also, voters might be swayed by propaganda, strong personalities, intimidation, and expensive advertising campaigns. James Madison argued that direct democracy is the \\"tyranny of the majority\\". Some opposition to the referendum has arisen from its use by dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini who, it is argued, used the plebiscite to disguise oppressive policies as populism. Dictators may also make use of referendums as well as show elections to further legitimize their authority such as Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar in 1933, Benito Mussolini in 1934, Adolf Hitler in 1936, Francisco Franco in 1947, Park Chung-hee in 1972, and Ferdinand Marcos in 1973. Hitler's use of plebiscites is argued as the reason why, since World War II, there has been no provision in Germany for the holding of referendums at the federal level. In recent years, referendums have been used strategically by several European governments trying to pursue political and electoral goals. In 1995, Bruton considered that =Closed questions and the separability problem= Some critics of the referendum attack the use of closed questions. A difficulty called the separability problem can plague a referendum on two or more issues. If one issue is in fact, or in perception, related to another on the ballot, the imposed simultaneous voting of first preference on each issue can result in an outcome which is displeasing to most. =Undue limitations on regular government power= Several commentators have noted that the use of citizens' initiatives to amend constitutions has so tied the government to a jumble of popular demands as to render the government unworkable. A 2009 article in The Economist argued that this had restricted the ability of the California state government to tax the people and pass the budget, and called for an entirely new Californian constitution. A similar problem also arises when elected governments accumulate excessive debts. That can severely reduce the effective margin for later governments. Both these problems can be moderated by a combination of other measures as * strict rules for correct accounting on budget plans and effective public expenditure; * mandatory assessment by an independent public institution of all budgetary implications of all legislative proposals, before they can be approved; * mandatory prior assessment of the constitutional coherence of any proposal; * interdiction of extra-budget expenditure (tax payers anyway have to fund them, sooner or later).

She was born in poverty in the rural village of Los Toldos, in the Pampas, as the youngest of five children. In 1934 at the age of 15, she moved to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires to pursue a career as a stage, radio, and film actress. She met Colonel Juan Per√≥n on 22 January 1944 during a charity event at the Luna Park Stadium to benefit the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Argentina. The two were married the following year. Juan Per√≥n was elected President of Argentina in 1946; during the next six years, Eva Per√≥n became powerful within the pro-Peronist trade unions, primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights. She also ran the Ministries of Labor and Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Per√≥n Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Women's Peronist Party. In 1951, Eva Per√≥n announced her candidacy for the Peronist nomination for the office of Vice President of Argentina, receiving great support from the Peronist political base, low-income and working-class Argentines who were referred to as descamisados or \\"shirtless ones\\". Opposition from the nation's military and bourgeoisie, coupled with her declining health, ultimately forced her to withdraw her candidacy.Fraser & Navarro (1996:150). In 1952, shortly before her death from cancer at 33, Eva Per√≥n was given the title of \\"Spiritual Leader of the Nation\\" by the Argentine Congress.Fraser & Navarro (1996:158). \\"As Evita's health continued to deteriorate that month, the city of Quilmes resolved to change its name to 'Eva Per√≥n,' and Congress, after a special legislative session, devoted to eulogies of 'the most remarkable woman of any historical epoch', gave her the title Jefe Espiritual de la Nacion (Spiritual Leader of the Nation).\\"Crassweller (1987:245). \\"A week later, on her thirty- third birthday, she received from Congress the title of Spiritual Leader of the Nation.\\" She was given a state funeral upon her death, a prerogative generally reserved for heads of state. Eva Per√≥n has become a part of international popular culture,Fraser & Navarro (1996:193). \\"...even she could not have foreseen her sudden transformation, from Latin American politician and religiose national cult figure to late-twentieth-century popular culture folk heroine.\\" most famously as the subject of the musical Evita (1976).Brantley, Ben. In London, a Pious 'Evita' for a Star-Struck Age. New York Times: 3 July 2006. Cristina √Ålvarez Rodr√≠guez claims that Evita has never left the collective consciousness of Argentines. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, the first woman elected President of Argentina, claims that women of her generation owe a debt to Eva for \\"her example of passion and combativeness\\". Early life Eva Duarte at her First Holy Communion, 1926 =Early childhood= Eva's autobiography, La Raz√≥n de mi Vida,Published in Argentina in 1952; subsequently published in English-speaking countries under the titles My Mission in Life and Evita by Evita contains no dates or references to childhood occurrences, and does not list the location of her birth or her name at birth.Per√≥n (1952). According to Jun√≠n's civil registry, a birth certificate shows that one Mar√≠a Eva Duarte was born on 7 May 1919. Her baptismal certificate lists the date of birth as 7 May 1919 under the name Eva Mar√≠a Ibarguren.Fraser & Navarro (1996:2‚Äì3).Act 495, from the Church \\"Capellan√≠a Vicaria de Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar\\" registry of Baptisms for the year 1919, baptism took place on 21 November 1919 It is thought that in 1945 the adult Eva Per√≥n created a forgery of her birth certificate for her marriage.Borroni & Vacca (1970). Eva Per√≥n spent her childhood in Jun√≠n, Buenos Aires province. Her father, Juan Duarte (1872‚Äì1926),Prutsch, U.: Eva Per√≥n. Leben und Sterben einer Legende. C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2015 was descended from French Basque immigrants. Her mother, Juana Ibarguren (9 February 1894 ‚Äì 11 February 1971), was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants. Juan Duarte, a wealthy rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, already had a wife and family there. At that time in rural Argentina, it was not uncommon for a wealthy man to have multiple families.Fraser & Navarro (1996:3). When Eva was a year old, Duarte returned permanently to his legal family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced to move to the poorest area of Jun√≠n. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.Fraser & Navarro (1996:4). When Duarte suddenly died and his mistress and their children sought to attend his funeral, there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates. Although Juana and the children were permitted to enter and pay their respects to Duarte, they were promptly directed out of the church. Mrs. Juan Duarte did not want her husband's mistress and children at the funeral and, as she was the legitimate wife, her orders were respected. =Jun√≠n= Before abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte had been her sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that, after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a document declaring that the children were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname.Barnes (1978). Soon after, Juana moved her children to a one-room apartment in Jun√≠n. To pay the rent on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias. Eventually, owing to Eva's older brother's financial help, the family moved into a bigger house, which they later transformed into a boarding house. During this time, young Eva often participated in school plays and concerts. One of her favorite pastimes was the cinema. Though Eva's mother had a few plans for Eva, wanting to marry her off to one of the local bachelors, Eva herself dreamed of becoming a famous actress. Eva's love for acting was reinforced in October 1933, when she played a small role in a school play called Arriba Estudiantes (Students Arise), which Barnes describes as \\"an emotional, patriotic, flag-waving melodrama.\\" After the play, Eva was determined to become an actress. =Move to Buenos Aires= Eva Duarte in 1944 at age 25, photographed by Annemarie Heinrich In her autobiography, she explained that all the people from her town who had been to the big cities described them as \\"marvelous places, where nothing was given but wealth\\". In 1934, at the age of 15, Eva escaped her poverty-stricken village when she ran off with a young musician to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires. The young couple's relationship ended almost as quickly as it had begun, but Eva remained in Buenos Aires. She began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio, and she eventually became a film actress. She bleached her naturally black hair to blonde, a look she maintained for the rest of her life. It is often reported that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agust√≠n Magaldi. However, there is no record of the married Magaldi performing in Jun√≠n in 1934 (and, even if he had done so, he usually traveled with his wife)Fraser & Navarro (p. 11).. Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Do√±a Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family.Quieroz (p. 14). While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires. Eva Duarte and Libertad Lamarque in La Cabalgata del Circo, 1945 Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Eva Duarte was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education or connections. The city was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the Great Depression. On 28 March 1935, she had her professional debut in the play Mrs. Perez (la Se√±ora de P√©rez), at the Comedias Theater. In 1936, Eva toured nationally with a theater company, worked as a model, and was cast in a few B-grade movie melodramas. In 1942, Eva experienced some economic stability when a company called Candilejas (sponsored by a soap manufacturer) hired her for a daily role in one of their radio dramas called Muy Bien, which aired on Radio El Mundo (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time.Fraser & Navarro (p. 26) Later that year, she signed a five-year contract with Radio Belgrano, which assured her a role in a popular historical-drama program called Great Women of History, in which she played Elizabeth I of England, Sarah Bernhardt, and the last Tsarina of Russia. Eventually, Eva Duarte came to co-own the radio company. By 1943, Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousand pesos a month, making her one of the highest-paid radio actresses in the nation. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran Radio El Mundo with Eva Duarte, is said to have not liked her, but to have noted that she was \\"thoroughly dependable\\".Fraser & Navarro (1996:27). Eva also had a short-lived film career, but none of the films in which she appeared were hugely successful. In one of her last films, La cabalgata del circo (The Circus Cavalcade), Eva played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman, the movie's star, Libertad Lamarque. As a result of her success with radio dramas and the films, Eva achieved some financial stability. In 1942, she was able to move into her apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of Recoleta, on 1567 Calle Posadas. The next year, Eva began her career in politics, as one of the founders of the Argentine Radio Syndicate (ARA). Early relationship with Juan Per√≥n Evita and Juan Per√≥n in 1947Official portrait of Juan Domingo Per√≥n and Evita, by Numa Ayrinhac in 1948. He is the only Argentine President to be accompanied by the First Lady in an official portrait. On 15 January 1944, an earthquake occurred in the town of San Juan, Argentina, killing ten thousand people. In response, Per√≥n, who was then the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. He devised a plan to have an \\"artistic festival\\" as a fundraiser, and invited radio and film actors to participate. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a gala held at Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims. It was at this gala, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Colonel Juan Per√≥n.Fraser & Navarro (1996:32‚Äì33). Eva promptly became the colonel's mistress. Eva referred to the day she met her future husband as her \\"marvelous day\\".Per√≥n (1952:17). Juan Per√≥n and Eva left the gala together at around two in the morning.Fraser & Navarro (1996:33). (Per√≥n's first wife, Aurelia Tiz√≥n, had died of cancer in 1938.) Eva Duarte had no knowledge of or interest in politics prior to meeting Per√≥n; therefore, she never argued with Per√≥n or any of his inner circle, but merely absorbed what she heard.Fraser & Navarro (1996:44). Juan Per√≥n later claimed in his memoir that he purposefully selected Eva as his pupil, and set out to create in her a \\"second I.\\"Per√≥n () (1976). Juan Per√≥n may have allowed Eva Duarte such intimate exposure and knowledge of his inner circle because of his age: he was 48 and she was 24 when they met. He had come to politics late in life, and was therefore free of preconceived ideas of how his political career should be conducted, and he was willing to accept whatever aid she offered him. In May 1944, it was announced that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the formation of the union, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Juan Per√≥n had made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized, in soap opera form, the accomplishments of Juan Per√≥n. Often, Per√≥n's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Per√≥n.Fraser & Navarro (1996:43). Rise to power  =Juan Per√≥n's arrest= Demonstration for Per√≥n's release, on 17 October 1945. The Casa Rosada is seen in the background. By early 1945, a group of Army officers called the GOU for \\"Grupo de Oficiales Unidos\\" (United Officers' Group), nicknamed \\"The Colonels\\", had gained considerable influence within the Argentine government. President Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez became wary of Juan Per√≥n's growing power within the government and was unable to curb that power. On 24 February 1944, Ram√≠rez signed his own resignation paper, which was drafted by Juan Per√≥n himself; Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell, a friend of Juan Per√≥n, became president, and Juan Per√≥n returned to his job as Labor Minister, at which point he was the most powerful man in the Argentine government.Fraser & Navarro (1996:39). On 9 October 1945 Juan Per√≥n was arrested by his opponents within the government who feared that, due to the strong support of the descamisados, the workers and the poor of the nation, Per√≥n's popularity might eclipse that of the sitting president. Six days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people gathered in front of the Casa Rosada, Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Per√≥n's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Per√≥n stepped onto the balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was particularly powerful because it dramatically recalled important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Per√≥n enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained \\"mystic overtones\\" of a \\"quasi-religious\\" nature.Crassweller (1987:170‚Äì1). Eva Per√≥n has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Per√≥n from prison on 17 October 1945. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the Lloyd Webber musical; most historians agree that this version of events is unlikely.A&E; (1996). At the time of Per√≥n's imprisonment, Eva was still merely an actress. She had no political clout with the various labor unions, and it is claimed that she was not well liked within Per√≥n's inner circle, nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point. When Juan Per√≥n was imprisoned, Eva Duarte was suddenly disenfranchised. In reality, the massive rally that freed Per√≥n from prison was organized by the various unions, such as General Labor Confederation, or CGT as they came to be known. To this day, 17 October is something of a holiday for the Justicialist Party in Argentina (celebrated as D√≠a de la Lealtad, or \\"Loyalty Day\\"). What followed was shocking and nearly unheard of. Juan Per√≥n, the well-connected and politically rising star, married Eva. Despite Eva's childhood illegitimacy, and having an uncertain reputation, Per√≥n was in love with Eva, and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest touched him deeply, and so he married her, providing a respectability she had never known. Eva and Juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in Jun√≠n on 18 October 1945 and in a church wedding on 9 December 1945 in La Plata. =1946 Presidential election victory= After his release from prison, Juan Per√≥n decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Per√≥n's movement. European tour Per√≥n arrives in Madrid. In 1947, Eva embarked on a much-publicized \\"Rainbow Tour\\" of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as Francisco Franco and Pope Pius XII. The tour had its genesis in an invitation that the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per√≥n; Eva decided that if Juan Per√≥n would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, then she would.Fraser & Navarro (1996:88‚Äì89). Argentina had only recently emerged from its \\"wartime quarantine\\", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with Ant√≥nio Salazar of Portugal, the last remaining Western European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many other European countries in addition to Spain, which would make it seem that Eva's sympathies were not specifically with Francoist Spain but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political \\"goodwill\\" tour. Eva was well received in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Capilla Real de Granada. Francoist Spain had not recovered from the Spanish Civil War (the autarkic economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-peseta notes to many poor children she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the Order of Isabella the Catholic. Eva then visited Rome, where the reception was not as warm as it had been in Spain. Though Pope Pius XII did not give her a Papal decoration, she was allowed the time usually allotted to queens and was given a rosary. Fraser & Navarro (1996:89). Her next stop was France, where she was generally well received. She visited the Palace of Versailles, among other sites. She also met with Charles de Gaulle. She promised France two shipments of wheat. While in France, Eva received word that George VI would not receive her when she planned to visit Britain, regardless of what his Foreign Office might advise,Alan Michie, God Save The Queen, p. ___ (1952) and that her visit would not be viewed as a state visit. Eva regarded the royal family's refusal to meet her as a snub, and canceled the trip to the United Kingdom. Eva gave \\"exhaustion\\" as the official reason for not going on to Britain. Per√≥n wearing a dress designed by Christian Dior Eva also visited Switzerland during her European tour, a visit that has been viewed as the worst part of the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she traveled down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough and, concluding the two-month tour, returned to Argentina. Members of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the European tour was to deposit funds in a Swiss bank account. Although this was not an unusual practice for wealthy Argentines, \\"there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Swiss Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory,\\" Fraser & Navarro (1996:98‚Äì99). and it was unlikely that a Swiss bank account existed.Fraser & Navarro (1996:208) During her tour to Europe, Eva Per√≥n was featured in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption ‚Äì \\"Eva Per√≥n: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow\\" ‚Äì was a reference to the name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Per√≥n.) The 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.Fraser & Navarro (1996:91). After returning to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie-star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone and even the style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva began to appear in public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses. Charitable and feminist activities =Eva Foundation= Per√≥n meets with the public in her foundation's office. The Sociedad de Beneficencia (Society of Beneficence), a charity group made up of 87 society ladies, was responsible for most works of charity in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Per√≥n. At one point the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but those days had long since passed by the time of the first term of Juan Per√≥n. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies, but by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government. It had been the tradition of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But the ladies of the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Per√≥n's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. The ladies of the Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans; therefore, the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. This version of events is arguable, but the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The Eva Per√≥n Foundation began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.Fraser & Navarro (1996:117). In The Woman with the Whip, the first English-language biography of Eva Per√≥n, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation, because it was merely a means of funneling government money into private Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Per√≥ns.Main (1980). Fraser and Navarro counter these claims, writing that Ram√≥n Cereijo, the Minister of Finance, did keep records, and that the foundation \\"began as the simplest response to the poverty [Evita] encountered each day in her office\\" and to \\"the appalling backwardness of social services‚Äîor charity, as it was still called‚Äîin Argentina.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:114). Crassweller writes that the foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support the foundation, as did a levy on casinos and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes that there were some cases of businesses being pressured to donate to the foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.Crassweller (1987:209‚Äì210). Within a few years, the foundation had assets in cash and goods in excess of three billion pesos, or over $200 million at the exchange rate of the late 1940s. It employed 14,000 workers, of whom 6,000 were construction workers and 26 were priests. It purchased and distributed annually 400,000 pairs of shoes, 500,000 sewing machines, and 200,000 cooking pots. The foundation also gave scholarships, built homes, hospitals, and other charitable institutions. Every aspect of the foundation was under Evita's supervision. The foundation also built entire communities, such as Evita City, which still exists today. Due to the works and health services of the foundation, for the first time in history there was no inequality in Argentine health care.Fraser & Navarro (1996:119). Per√≥n kicks off the Youth Football Championship, 1948 It was Evita's work with the foundation that played a large role in her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she \\"...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism.\\" Poet Jos√© Mar√≠a Casti√±eira de Dios, a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: \\"I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense....\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:126‚Äì27). Toward the end of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often ignoring her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, \\"Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:126). Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt as though she were on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. \\"It is not surprising\\", writes Crassweller, \\"that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental.\\" Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.Crassweller (1987:214‚Äì217) =Women's Peronist Party and women's suffrage= Per√≥n supported the female vote. Eva Per√≥n has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond Eva's powers. Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped. A new women's suffrage bill was introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It was necessary to wait more than a year before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, Juan Per√≥n signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers. Eva Per√≥n then created the Women's Peronist Party, the first large female political party in the nation. By 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. While Eva Per√≥n did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Per√≥n. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage and the organization of the Women's Peronist Party granted Juan Per√≥n a large majority (63 percent) of the vote in the 1951 presidential elections. 1952 Presidential election =Vice-Presidential nomination= A crowd of an estimated two million gathers in 1951 to show support for the Juan Per√≥n‚ÄìEva Per√≥n ticket. In 1951, Evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice- president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Per√≥n's death was not something the military could accept. She received great support from the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women's Party. The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Per√≥n himself. The wide support Evita's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Per√≥n himself was.Fraser & Navarro (1986:143). Per√≥n embraces her husband during the 1951 joint ticket rally, unable to accept popular calls that she run for vice-president. On 22 August 1951, the unions held a mass rally of two million people called \\"Cabildo Abierto.\\" (The name \\"Cabildo Abierto\\" was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the May Revolution, in 1810.) The Per√≥ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the Avenida 9 de Julio, several blocks away from the Casa Rosada, the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per√≥n. It has been claimed that \\"Cabildo Abierto\\" was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure. At the mass rally, the crowd demanded that Evita publicly announce her candidacy as vice president. She pleaded for more time to make her decision. The exchange between Evita and the crowd of two million became, for a time, a genuine and spontaneous dialogue, with the crowd chanting, \\"¬°Evita, Vice-Presidente!\\" When Evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind, the crowd demanded, \\"¬°Ahora, Evita, ahora!\\" (\\"Now, Evita, now!\\"). Eventually, they came to a compromise. Evita told the audience that she would announce her decision over the radio a few days later. =Declining health= Eva Per√≥n addresses the Peronists on 17 October 1951. By this point she had become too weak to stand without Juan Per√≥n's aid. Eventually, she declined the invitation to run for vice-president. She said her only ambition was that in the large chapter of history to be written about her husband, the footnotes would mention a woman who brought the \\"...hopes and dreams of the people to the president\\", a woman who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into \\"glorious reality\\". In Peronist rhetoric, this event has come to be referred to as \\"The Renunciation\\", portraying Evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of marianismo. Most biographers postulate that Evita did not so much renounce her ambition as bow to pressure from her husband, the military, and the Argentine upper class, who preferred that she not enter the race. Per√≥n's renunciation speech (in Spanish). Source: Radio Nacional. RTA. Argentina On 9 January 1950, Evita fainted in public and underwent surgery three days later. Although it was reported that she had undergone an appendectomy, she was, in fact, diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer.Famous Patients, Famous Operations, 2002 ‚Äì Part 6: The Case of the Politician's Wife Medscape Today, 5 December 2002. Retrieved 8 July 2010. Fainting episodes continued through 1951 (including the evening after \\"Cabildo abierto\\"), with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding. By 1951, it had become evident that her health was rapidly deteriorating. Although her diagnosis was withheld from her by Juan,Fraser & Navarro (1996:148). she knew she was not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical. Only a few months after \\"the Renunciation\\", Evita secretly underwent a radical hysterectomy, performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack, of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in an attempt to eradicate her advanced cervical cancer.Lerner (2000). In 2011, a Yale neurosurgeon, Dr. Daniel E. Nijensohn, studied Evita's skull x-rays and photographic evidence and said that Per√≥n may have been given a prefrontal lobotomy in the last months of her life, \\"...to relieve the pain, agitation and anxiety she suffered in the final months of her illness.\\" =Re- election and Spiritual Leader of the Nation= On 7 May 1952, Evita's 33rd birthday, she was given the official title of \\"Spiritual Leader of the Nation\\" by the Argentine Congress. On 4 June 1952, Evita rode with Juan Per√≥n in a parade through Buenos Aires in celebration of his re-election as President of Argentina. Evita was by this point so ill that she was unable to stand without support. Underneath her oversized fur coat was a frame made of plaster and wire that allowed her to stand. She took a triple dose of pain medication before the parade, and took another two doses when she returned home. Death and aftermath Evita's elaborately adorned funeral =Death= Despite the hysterectomy, P√©ron's cervical cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly. She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapya novel treatment at that time.

Radio broadcasts throughout the country were interrupted with the announcement that \\"the Press Secretary's Office of the Presidency of the Nation fulfills its very sad duty to inform the people of the Republic that at 20:25 hours, Mrs. Eva Per√≥n, Spiritual Leader of the Nation, died.\\"Ortiz. =Mourning= Immediately after Per√≥n's death, the government suspended all official activities for two days and ordered that all flags be flown at half-staff for ten days.

The crowd outside of the presidential residence, where Evita died, grew dense, congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction. Nearly three million people attended Evita's funeral in the streets of Buenos Aires The morning after her death, while Evita's body was being moved to the Ministry of Labour Building, eight people were crushed to death in the throngs. In the following 24 hours, over 2,000 people were treated in city hospitals for injuries sustained in the rush to be near Evita as her body was being transported, and thousands more were treated on the spot. For the following two weeks, lines stretched for many city blocks with mourners waiting hours to see Evita's body lie in state at the Ministry of Labour. The streets of Buenos Aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers. Within a day of Per√≥n's death, all flower shops in Buenos Aires had run out of stock. Flowers were flown in from all over the country, and as far away as Chile. Despite the fact that Eva Per√≥n never held a political office, she was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state,Fraser & Navarro (1996:164‚Äì166). along with a full Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. A memorial was held for the Argentine team during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki due to Eva Per√≥n's death during those games.1952 Summer Olympics official report. p. 91. ‚Äì accessed 1 August 2010. On Saturday, 9 August, the body was transferred to the Congress Building for an additional day of public viewing, and a memorial service attended by the entire Argentine legislative body. The next day, after a final Mass, the coffin was laid on a gun carriage pulled by CGT officials. It was followed by Per√≥n, his cabinet, Eva's family and friends, the delegates and representatives of the Partido Peronista Femenino‚Äîthen workers, nurses and students of the Eva Peron Foundation. Flowers were thrown from balconies and windows. There were different interpretations of the popular mourning of Eva Per√≥n's death. Some reporters viewed the mourning as authentic, others saw a public succumbing to another of the \\"passion plays\\" of the Peronist regime. Time magazine reported that the Peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement.Time. \\"In Mourning.\\" 11 August 1952..

Taylor, professor of anthropology at Rice University, has said that Evita was well aware of the pain of being born \\"illegitimate.\\" Taylor speculates that Evita's awareness of this may have influenced her decision to have the law changed so that \\"illegitimate\\" children would henceforth be referred to as \\"natural\\" children.Eva Per√≥n: Intimate Portrait. Lifetime Television. Interview with Julie M. Taylor Upon her death, the Argentine public was told that Evita was only 30. The discrepancy was meant to dovetail with Evita's earlier tampering with her birth certificate. After becoming the first lady in 1946, Evita had her birth records altered to read that she had been born to married parents, and placed her birth date three years later, making herself younger. =Memorial= Dr. Ara inspects Eva Per√≥n's embalmed corpse Shortly after Evita's death Pedro Ara, who was well known for his embalming skill, was approached to embalm the body. It is doubtful that Evita ever expressed a wish to be embalmed, and suggest that it was most likely Juan Per√≥n's decision. Ara replaced the subject's blood with glycerine in order to preserve the organs and lend an appearance of \\"artistically rendered sleep.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:164). Biographer Robert D. Crassweller writes that the English-speaking nations of North America and Europe largely misunderstood Argentina's response to the death of Per√≥n as well as the ornate funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Per√≥ns and of Argentina, saying that the Per√≥ns were of the Hispanic tradition and that their opposition was largely of British ancestry.Crassweller, Robert D. Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina. WW. Norton and Company: 1987. p. 248. =Disappearance and return of body= Per√≥n rests in La Recoleta Cemetery Shortly after Evita's death, plans were made to construct a memorial in her honour. The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the descamisados, was projected to be larger than the Statue of Liberty. Evita's body was to be stored in the base of the monument and, in the tradition of Lenin's corpse, to be displayed for the public. While the monument was being constructed, Evita's embalmed body was displayed in her former office at the CGT building for almost two years. Before the monument to Evita was completed, Juan Per√≥n was overthrown in a military coup, the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, in 1955. Per√≥n hastily fled the country and was unable to make arrangements to secure Evita's body. Following his flight, a military dictatorship took power. The new authorities removed Evita's body from display, and its whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued a ban on Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Per√≥n in one's home, but to speak their names. In 1971, the military revealed that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name \\"Mar√≠a Maggi.\\" It appeared that her body had been damaged during its transport and storage, such as compressions to her face and disfigurement of one of her feet due to the body having been left in an upright position. In 1995, Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez published Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Colonel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, and that one of the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.Fraser & Navarro (1996:Epilogue). =Final resting place= In 1971, Evita's body was exhumed and flown to Spain, where Juan Per√≥n maintained the corpse in his home. Juan and his third wife, Isabel, decided to keep the corpse in their dining room on a platform near the table. In 1973, Juan Per√≥n came out of exile and returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time. Per√≥n died in office in 1974. His third wife, Isabel Per√≥n, whom he had married on 15 November 1961, and who had been elected vice-president, succeeded him. She became the first female president in the Western Hemisphere. Isabel had Eva Per√≥n's body returned to Argentina and (briefly) displayed beside her husband's. Per√≥n's body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. The previous removal of Evita's body was avenged by the Montoneros when they in 1970 stole the corpse of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had previously killed. Montoneros then used the captive body of Aramburu to pressure for the repatriation of Evita's body. Once Evita's body arrived in Argentina, the Montoneros gave up Aramburu's corpse and abandoned it in a street in Buenos Aires. The Argentine government took elaborate measures to make Per√≥n's tomb secure. The tomb's marble floor has a trapdoor that leads to a compartment containing two coffins. Under that compartment is a second trapdoor and a second compartment. That is where Per√≥n's coffin rests. The claim is often made that her tomb is so secure that it could withstand a nuclear attack. \\"It reflects a fear that the body will disappear from the tomb and that the woman, or rather the myth of the woman, will reappear.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:192). Legacy and criticism =Argentina and Latin America= Official portrait of Eva Per√≥n in 1951, a few months before her death In his essay titled \\"Latin America\\" published in The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, John McManners claims that the appeal and success of Eva Per√≥n are related to Latin American mythology and concepts of divinity. McManners claims that Eva Per√≥n consciously incorporated aspects of the theology of the Virgin and of Mary Magdalene into her public persona.McManners (2001:440). Historian Hubert Herring has described Eva Per√≥n as \\"Perhaps the shrewdest woman yet to appear in public life in Latin America.\\"Adams (1993:203). In a 1996 interview, Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez referred to Eva Per√≥n as \\"the Cinderella of the tango and the Sleeping Beauty of Latin America.\\" Mart√≠nez suggested she has remained an important cultural icon for the same reasons as fellow Argentine Che Guevara: Although not a government holiday, the anniversary of Eva Per√≥n's death is marked by many Argentines each year. Additionally, Eva Per√≥n has been featured on Argentine coins, and a form of Argentine currency called \\"Evitas\\" was named in her honour.\\"Argentines swap pesos for 'Evitas'\\", BBC.

Kirchner also says that women of her generation, who came of age in the 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina, owe a debt to Evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness. On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Per√≥n's death, a museum opened in her honour called Museo Evita. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriguez, houses many of Eva Per√≥n's clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life, and has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Per√≥n Foundation.Evita Museum. Retrieved 13 October 2006 In the book Eva Per√≥n: The Myths of a Woman, cultural anthropologist Julie M. Taylor claims that Evita has remained important in Argentina due to the combination of three unique factors: President Cristina Kirchner in the exhibition of \\"Evita: Ambassador of Peace\\", in the State Historical Museum of Moscow Taylor argues that the fourth factor in Evita's continued importance in Argentina relates to her status as a dead woman and the power that death holds over the public imagination. Taylor suggests that Evita's embalmed corpse is analogous to the incorruptibility of various Catholic saints, such as Bernadette Soubirous, and has powerful symbolism within the largely Catholic cultures of Latin America: John Balfour was the British ambassador in Argentina during the Per√≥n regime, and describes Evita's popularity: In 2011, two giant murals of Evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio Argentino Roca was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. The image in the notes is based on a 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund.

Spruille Braden, a diplomat from the United States who was greatly supported by Juan Per√≥n's opponents, campaigned against Juan Per√≥n's first candidacy on the platform that Juan Per√≥n was a fascist and a Nazi. The perception of the Per√≥ns as fascists may have been enhanced during Evita's 1947 European tour during which she was a guest of honour of Francisco Franco. By 1947, Franco had become politically isolated as one of the few remaining fascists to retain power. Franco, therefore, was in desperate need of a political ally. With nearly a third of Argentina's population of Spanish descent, it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with Spain. Commenting on the international perception of Evita during her 1947 European tour, Fraser and Navarro write, \\"It was inevitable that Evita be viewed in a fascist context. Therefore, both Evita and Per√≥n were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway country.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:100). Laurence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that in contrast to Nazi ideology, the Per√≥ns were not anti-Semitic. In the book Inside Argentina from Per√≥n to Menem: 1950‚Äì2000 from an American Point of View, Levine writes: Juan Per√≥n and future Economy Minister Jos√© Ber Gelbard Biographer Robert D. Crassweller writes, \\"Peronism was not fascism\\", and \\"Peronism was not Nazism.\\" Crassweller also refers to the comments of U.S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith. While visiting Argentina in 1947, Messersmith made the following statement: \\"There is not as much social discrimination against Jews here as there is right in New York or in most places at home.\\"Crassweller (1987). Time Magazine published an article by Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez‚ÄîArgentine writer, journalist, and former director of the Latin American program at Rutgers University‚Äîtitled \\"The Woman Behind the Fantasy: Prostitute, Fascist, Profligate‚ÄîEva Peron Was Much Maligned, Mostly Unfairly\\". In this article, Mart√≠nez writes that the accusations that Eva Per√≥n was a fascist, a Nazi, and a thief had been made against her for decades. He wrote that the allegations were untrue: In his 2002 doctoral dissertation at Ohio State University, Lawrence D. Bell writes that the governments that preceded Juan Per√≥n had been anti-Semitic but that his government was not. Juan Per√≥n \\"eagerly and enthusiastically\\" attempted to recruit the Jewish community into his government and set up a branch of the Peronist party for Jewish members, known as the Organizaci√≥n Israelita Argentina (OIA). Per√≥n's government was the first to court the Argentine Jewish community and the first to appoint Jewish citizens to public office.The Jews and Per√≥n: Communal Politics and National Identity in Peronist Argentina, 1946‚Äì1955 by Lawrence D. Bell, PhD dissertation, 2002, Ohio State University, Retrieved 2 May 2008 Kevin Passmore writes that the Peronist regime, more than any other in Latin America, has been accused of being fascist. But he says that the Peronist regime was not fascist, and what passed for fascism under Per√≥n never took hold in Latin America. Additionally, because the Peronist regime allowed rival political parties to exist, it cannot be described as totalitarian.Passmore, Kevin. Fascism: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press. . =International popular culture= Liza Minnelli reading the plaque on Eva Per√≥n's tomb, 1993. In the early 1980s, Minnelli was considered for the lead role in the movie version of the musical Evita.Fraser & Navarro (1996:195). \\"Stigwood next hired the flamboyant director Ken Russell, who tested Elaine Paige, who had starred in the stage version, and Liza Minnelli.\\" By the late 20th century, Eva Per√≥n had become the subject of numerous articles, books, stage plays, and musicals, ranging from the biography The Woman with the Whip to a 1981 TV movie titled Evita Per√≥n starring Faye Dunaway in the title role. The most successful rendering of Eva Per√≥n's life has been the musical production Evita. The musical began as a concept album co-produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in 1976, with Julie Covington in the title role. Elaine Paige was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in London's West End and won the 1978 Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical. In 1980, Patti LuPone won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as the title character in the Broadway production. The Broadway production also won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Nicholas Fraser claims that to date \\"the musical stage production has been performed on every continent except Antarctica and has generated over $2 billion in revenue.\\"Fraser & Navarro (1996:193). As early as 1978, the musical was considered as the basis for a movie. After a nearly 20-year production delay, Madonna was cast in the title role for the 1996 film version and won the Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.\\" In response to the American film, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita's life, an Argentine film company released Eva Per√≥n: The True Story. The Argentine production starred actress Esther Goris in the title role. This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the Oscar in the category of \\"Best Foreign Language Film.\\" Nicholas Fraser writes that Evita is the perfect popular culture icon for our times because her career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common. During Evita's time it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life. Her detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into show business. But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the cult of celebrity and public political life had become insignificant. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita's story is appealing to our celebrity-obsessed age because her story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest clich√©s, the rags to riches story.Fraser & Navarro (1996:194). Reflecting on Eva Per√≥n's popularity more than half a century after her death, Alma Guillermoprieto writes that, \\"Evita's life has evidently just begun.\\"Guillermoprieto (2002:16) Titles and honours Eva Peron appears on the 100 peso note first issued in 2012 and scheduled for replacement sometime in 2018.

It is one of the largest cities in the Sahel. The city also serves as the administrative and economic center of Mauritania. Nouakchott was a mid size village of little importance until 1958, when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but drought and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been improved. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy and is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott‚ÄìOumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutes of higher learning. History Nouakchott was a large, fortified fishing village (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital city and the area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village was selected as the capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans. Construction began in March 1958 to enlarge the village to house a population of 15,000 and the basics were completed by the time that the French granted independence on 28 November 1960.Britannica, Nouakchott Nouakchott, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinqui√®me Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises. The city was attacked twice in 1976 by the Polisario Front during the Western Sahara conflict, but little damage was caused by the guerrillas. The city has had massive and unconstrained growth, driven by the North African drought, since the beginning of the 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.2 million and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399. Geography Nouakchott seen from the Spot Satellite Population density and low elevation coastal zones. Nouakchott is especially vulnerable to sea level rise. Located on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert, it lies on the west coast of Africa. With the exception of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story. Nouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas in the north and the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example. The kebbe consists of cement buildings that are built overnight and made to look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, it was estimated that more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetised √élots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh Ze√Øna, Toujournine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar Na√Øm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinqui√®me) Arrondissement is home to a large shopping area. =Climate= Nouakchott features a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen: BWh) with hot temperatures throughout the year, but cool winter night temperatures. Due to the city's oceanside location, Nouakchott is generally not quite as hot as other cities with this climate. Still, the city can experience very hot days. While average high temperatures are relatively constant at around , average low temperatures can range from during the summer months to during the winter months. Minimum temperatures can be as low as during winter nights in Nouakchott. Average rainfall in the city is a year. Government A partial view of the city Nouakchott is divided into three regions (wilayat), each of which contains three departments (moughataa): * Nouakchott-Nord (North Nouakchott): Dar-Naim, Teyarett, Toujouonine * Nouakchott-Ouest (West Nouakchott): Ksar, Sebkha, Tevragh-Zeina * Nouakchott- Sud (South Nouakchott): Arafat, El Mina, Riyad The town was initially divided into four departments in 1973. In 1986 the current nine departments were created. Formerly a district, in 1990 Nouakchott became a region of Mauritania. On 25 November 2014, it was split into the three current regions and its governor Mahi Ould Hamed became the first governor of Nouakchott-Nord. Demographics For comparison, its population was only 20,000 in 1969. Part of the difficulty in estimating the city's population is that part of it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399. =Slum resettlement= In 2009, the government of Mauritania announced that it would begin a process of clearing the slum on the outskirts of Nouakchott, as 24,000 families would eventually be relocated to planned housing in the city. The process was scheduled to begin with the relocation of 9,000 families from the outskirts into the poor Arafat department neighbourhood of \\"Kosovo\\", popularly named for its high crime rate and poor services. The government planned to begin moving families in June 2009, despite concerns from aid agencies that needed infrastructure could not be put in place in the receiving neighbourhood. In 2013, it was reported that \\"slums have been replaced by social dwellings for the poorest\\", with the World Bank reporting that the plan met with substantial success, resulting in access to improved services for 181,035 people in the slum areas. Economy The beach in Nouakchott Nouakchott is the center of the Mauritanian economy, with three-quarters of service sector enterprises located in the city with 90% of the city's economic activity consisting of informal transactions. Some inhabitants have multiple addresses and maintain strong ties with their regions of origin, at times returning for labor.  Transport  Nouakchott has a Chinese-built deepwater port that opened in 1986. It was designed for a capacity of of cargo a year, but has been handling 1,500,000 tons (DWT) by 2009. China agreed in 2009 to invest US$282 million in the port, aiming to extend the main quay by over . As of 2011, the World Bank was investigating funding a new shipping container facility at the port. Air service is provided by Nouakchott‚ÄìOumtounsy International Airport, which replaced the previous Nouakchott International Airport in June 2016. The Cairo‚ÄìDakar Highway leg from Nouakchott to Nouadhibou was paved in 2004, although the Nouakchott-Rosso leg was paved before independence. A road (Route d'Espoir (Road of Hope)) connects the city with N√©ma via Boutilimit and Kiffa. In the city, there is a public transport and commuter system, with vehicles serving major boulevards. Education The city is home to the University of Nouakchott Al Aasriya, the main university in Mauritania, opened in 1981. As of 1995, it had 70 professors and 2800 students. Other higher education facilities include the Lebanese International University of Mauritania, the National School of Administration, the College of Science and Technology and the Higher Scientific Institute. There are many primary and secondary schools, among the most prominent are the American International School of Nouakchott and the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Th√©odore Monod.  Culture  The Saudi mosque, one of Nouakchott's twelve mosques Attractions in Nouakchott include the National Museum of Mauritania, the National Library and the National Archives. The city hosts several markets including the Nouakchott Silver Market, and the beaches. One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh. Nouakchott is a principal selling place of native Saharan meteorites.  Places of worship  Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.Britannica, Mauritania , britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Nouakchott (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.

The city is located about north of Rome and southeast of Florence. It covers a high hilltop and part of the valleys around the area. The region of Umbria is bordered by Tuscany, Lazio, and Marche. Skyline of Perugia hilltop city and valley The history of Perugia goes back to the Etruscan period; Perugia was one of the main Etruscan cities. The city is also known as the universities town, with the University of Perugia founded in 1308 (about 34,000 students), the University for Foreigners (5,000 students), and some smaller colleges such as the Academy of Fine Arts \\"Pietro Vannucci\\" () public athenaeum founded in 1573, the Perugia University Institute of Linguistic Mediation for translators and interpreters, the Music Conservatory of Perugia, founded in 1788, and other institutes. Perugia is also a well- known cultural and artistic centre of Italy. The city hosts multiple annual festivals and events, e.g., the Eurochocolate Festival (October), the Umbria Jazz Festival (July), and the International Journalism Festival (in April), and is associated with multiple notable people in the arts. The painter Pietro Vannucci, nicknamed Perugino, was a native of Citt√† della Pieve, near Perugia. He decorated the local Sala del Cambio with a series of frescoes; eight of his pictures can also be seen in the National Gallery of Umbria.cf. Perugia, Raffaele Rossi, Pietro Scarpellini, 1993 (Vol. 1, pg. 337, 344) Perugino was the teacher of Raphael,\\"...it appears most probable that he did not enter Perugino's studio till the end of 1499, as during the four or five years before that Perugino was mostly absent from his native city. The so-called Sketch Book of Raphael in the academy of Venice contains studies apparently from the cartoons of some of Perugino's Sistine frescoes, possibly done as practice in drawing.\\" (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition). See also \\"Perugia\\". The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003 the great Renaissance artist who produced five paintings in Perugia (today no longer in the city)The precise role of Raphael in Perugino's works, executed during his apprenticeship, is disputed by scholars. The independent works depicted in Perugia are: the Ansidei Madonna (taken by the French under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino in 1798), the Deposition by Raphael (Pala Baglioni, this masterpiece was expropriated by Scipione Borghese in 1608, cf. 'The Guardian, October 19, 2004), the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints, by Raphael (formerly located in the convent of St Anthony of Padua cf.The Colonna Altarpiece review at Art History ), the Connestabile Madonna (this picture left Perugia in 1871, when Count Connestabile sold it to the emperor of Russia for ¬£13,200, cf. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica), the Oddi altar by Raphael (requisitioned by the French in 1798) and one fresco. Another painter, Pinturicchio, lived in Perugia. Galeazzo Alessi is the most famous architect from Perugia. The city's symbol is the griffin, which can be seen in the form of plaques and statues on buildings around the city. It is also the symbol of the local football club A.C. Perugia, who have previously played in the Serie A.  History  Perugia was an Umbrian settlementPerugia (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved May 21, 2007, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online but first appears in written history as Perusia, one of the 12 confederate cities of Etruria; it was first mentioned in Q. Fabius Pictor's account, utilized by Livy, of the expedition carried out against the Etruscan League by Fabius Maximus Rullianus\\"How much of his glory is due to his kinsman, Fabius Pictor, the first historian of Rome, or to the family legends, which found in Etruria the most fitting scene for the exploits of the great Fabian house, we cannot tell\\" (Walter W. How and Henry Devenish Leigh, A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar London: Longmans, Green 1898:112). in 310 or 309 BC. At that time a thirty-year indutiae (truce) was agreed upon;Livy ix.37.12). however, in 295 Perusia took part in the Third Samnite War and was reduced, with Volsinii and Arretium (Arezzo), to seek for peace in the following year.Livy ix.30.1‚Äì2, 31.1‚Äì3; indutiae with Volsinii, Perusia and Arretium, ix.37.4‚Äì5. In 216 and 205 BC it assisted Rome in the Second Punic War but afterwards it is not mentioned until 41‚Äì40 BC, when Lucius Antonius took refuge there, and was reduced by Octavian after a long siege, and its senators sent to their death. A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city.cf. Corpus Inscr.

It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases for statues exist, inscribed Augusto sacr(um) Perusia restituta; but it did not become a colonia, until 251‚Äì253 AD, when it was resettled as Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia, under the emperor C. Vibius Trebonianus Gallus.Latin inscriptions at two of the preserved Etruscan gates. It is hardly mentioned except by the geographers until it was the only city in Umbria to resist Totila, who captured it and laid the city waste in 547, after a long siege, apparently after the city's Byzantine garrison evacuated. Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the city's bishop, Herculanus, as representative of the townspeople.Patrick Amory, People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489‚Äì554 pp185-86, referring to Perugia in passing, notes the increasingly localized role assumed since the mid-5th century by the bishops. Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be flayed and beheaded. St. Herculanus (Sant'Ercolano) later became the city's patron saint.Procopius, Bellum Gothicum, 3 (7).2.35.2, characteristically does not mention the incident, reported in Gregory the Great, Dialogues, 13 , who imagines a seven-year siege (i.e. since 540, before the accession of Baduila) and dramatically reports Herculanus' grotesque murder. In the Lombard period Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of Tuscia.Procopius of Caesarea, Gothic Wars I,16 and III,35. In the 9th century, with the consent of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, it passed under the popes; but by the 11th century its commune was asserting itself, and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life, warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities‚Äî Foligno, Assisi, Spoleto, Todi, Siena, Arezzo etc. In 1186 Henry VI, rex romanorum and future emperor, granted diplomatic recognition to the consular government of the city; afterward Pope Innocent III, whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the patrimony of St. Peter, acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognised the established civic practices as having the force of law.cf. Perugia, Raffaele Rossi, Attilio Bartoli Angeli, Roberta Sottani 1993 (Vol. 1, pp. 120‚Äì140) aqueduct On various occasions the popes found asylum from the tumults of Rome within its walls, and it was the meeting-place of five conclaves (Perugia Papacy), including those that elected Honorius III (1216), Clement IV (1265), Celestine V (1294), and Clement V (1305); the papal presence was characterised by a pacificatory rule between the internal rivalries. But Perugia had no mind simply to subserve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty: the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy, moreover in 1282 Perugia was excommunicated due to a new military offensive against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition. On the other hand, side by side with the 13th century bronze griffin of Perugia above the door of the Palazzo dei Priori stands, as a Guelphic emblem, the lion, and Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of Guelphs and Ghibellines. However this dominant tendency was rather an anti-Germanic and Italian political strategy. The Angevin presence in Italy appeared to offer a counterpoise to papal powers: in 1319 Perugia declared the Angevin Saint Louis of Toulouse \\"Protector of the city's sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors\\"\\"Avvocato della Signoria cittadina e del Palazzo dei suoi Priori\\" and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori. Midway through the 14th century Bartholus of Sassoferrato, who was a renowned jurist, asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support. In 1347, at the time of Rienzi's unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman republic, Perugia sent ten ambassadors to pay him honour; and, when papal legates sought to coerce it by foreign soldiers, or to exact contributions, they met with vigorous resistance, which broke into open warfare with Pope Urban V in 1369; in 1370 the noble party reached an agreement signing the treaty of Bologna and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate; however the vicar-general of the Papal States, G√©rard du Puy, Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of Gregory IX,Made a cardinal by his uncle, 20 December 1375 (Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: 14th century) was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375, and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground. Civic peace was constantly disturbed in the 14th century by struggles between the party representing the people (Raspanti) and the nobles (Beccherini). After the assassination in 1398 of Biordo Michelotti, who had made himself lord of Perugia, the city became a pawn in the Italian Wars, passing to Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1400), to Pope Boniface IX (1403), and to Ladislaus of Naples (1408‚Äì14) before it settled into a period of sound governance under the Signoria of the condottiero Braccio da Montone (1416‚Äì24), who reached a concordance with the Papacy. Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families, power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni, who, though they had no legal position, defied all other authority, though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre, 14 July 1500. Gian Paolo Baglioni was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by Leo X; and in 1540 Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was defeated by Pier Luigi Farnese, and the city, captured and plundered by his soldiery, was deprived of its privileges. A citadel known as the Rocca Paolina, after the name of Pope Paul III, was built, to designs of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger \\"ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam.\\"\\"in order to bring to heel the audacious Perugini\\". In the Rocca Paolina In 1797, the city was conquered by French troops. On 4 February 1798, the Tiberina Republic was formed, with Perugia as capital, and the French tricolour as flag. In 1799, the Tiberina Republic merged to the Roman Republic. In 1832, 1838 and 1854, Perugia was hit by earthquakes. Following the collapse of the Roman republic of 1848‚Äì49, when the Rocca was in part demolished,cf. Touring Club Italiano, Guida d'Italia: Umbria (1966) it was seized in May 1849 by the Austrians. In June 1859 the inhabitants rebelled against the temporal authority of the Pope and established a provisional government, but the insurrection was quashed bloodily by Pius IX's troops.cf. Chicago Tribune, Jul 18, 1859 and \\"The outrage of the American witnesses in Perugia,\\" Chicago Tribune, Jul 21, 1859 In September 1860 the city was united finally, along with the rest of Umbria, as part of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War II the city suffered only some damage and was liberated by the British 8th army on 20 June 1944.  Economy  Palazzo dei Priori: the centre of communal government Perugia has become famous for chocolate, mostly because of a single firm, Perugina, whose Baci (\\"kisses\\" in English) are widely exported.Nestl√®-Perugina produced in 2005 about 1.5 million Baci a day. Each October, Perugia has an annual chocolate festival called EuroChocolate. In Italy, right in the kisser, The Washington Post, May 29, 2005 Perugian chocolate is popular in Italy. The company's plant located in San Sisto (Perugia) is the largest of Nestl√©'s nine sites in Italy. According to the Nestl√© USA official website, today Baci is the most famous chocolate brand in Italy. The city hosts a chocolate festival every October.  Geography  Perugia is the capital city of the region of Umbria. Cities' distances from Perugia: Assisi , Siena , Florence , Rome . = Climate = Even though Perugia is located in the central part of Italy, the city experiences a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) similar to much of Northern Italy. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  Demographics  Houses in Perugia In 2007, there were 163,287 people residing in Perugia, located in the province of Perugia, Umbria, of whom 47.7% were male and 52.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 16.41 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 21.51 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Perugia residents is 44 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Perugia grew by 7.86 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. , 90.84% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (particularly from Albania and Romania): 3.93%, the Americas: 2.01%, and North African: 1.3%. The majority of inhabitants are Roman Catholic.

It is made by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by phospholipase C (PLC). Together with diacylglycerol (DAG), IP3 is a second messenger molecule used in signal transduction in biological cells. While DAG stays inside the membrane, IP3 is soluble and diffuses through the cell, where it binds to its receptor, which is a calcium channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum. When IP3 binds its receptor, calcium is released into the cytosol, thereby activating various calcium regulated intracellular signals. Properties  =Chemical formula and molecular weight= IP3 is an organic molecule with a molecular mass of 420.10 g/mol. Its empirical formula is C6H15O15P3. It is composed of an inositol ring with three phosphate groups bound at the 1, 4, and 5 carbon positions, and three hydroxyl groups bound at positions 2, 3, and 6. =Chemical properties = Phosphate groups can exist in three different forms depending on a solution's pH. Phosphorus atoms can bind three oxygen atoms with single bonds and a fourth oxygen atom using a double/dative bond. The pH of the solution, and thus the form of the phosphate group determines its ability to bind to other molecules. The binding of phosphate groups to the inositol ring is accomplished by phosphor-ester binding (see phosphoric acids and phosphates). This bond involves combining a hydroxyl group from the inositol ring and a free phosphate group through a dehydration reaction. Considering that the average physiological pH is approximately 7.4, the main form of the phosphate groups bound to the inositol ring in vivo is PO42‚àí. This gives IP3 a net negative charge, which is important in allowing it to dock to its receptor, through binding of the phosphate groups to positively charged residues on the receptor. IP3 has three hydrogen bond donors in the form of its three hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl group on the 6th carbon atom in the inositol ring is also involved in IP3 docking. =Binding to its receptor= IP3 anion with oxygen atoms (red) and the hydrogen atoms involved in docking to InsP3R (dark blue) indicated The docking of IP3 to its receptor, which is called the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), was first studied using deletion mutagenesis in the early 1990s. Studies focused on the N-terminus side of the IP3 receptor. In 1997 researchers localized the region of the IP3 receptor involved with binding of IP3 to between amino acid residues 226 and 578 in 1997. Considering that IP3 is a negatively charged molecule, positively charged amino acids such as arginine and lysine were believed to be involved. Two arginine residues at position 265 and 511 and one lysine residue at position 508 were found to be key in IP3 docking. Using a modified form of IP3, it was discovered that all three phosphate groups interact with the receptor, but not equally. Phosphates at the 4th and 5th positions interact more extensively than the phosphate at the 1st position and the hydroxyl group at the 6th position of the inositol ring. Discovery The discovery that a hormone can influence phosphoinositide metabolism was made by Mabel R. Hokin (1924‚Äì2003) and her then husband Lowell E. Hokin in 1953, when they discovered that radioactive 32P phosphate was incorporated into the phosphatidylinositol of pancreas slices when stimulated with acetylcholine. Up until then phospholipids were believed to be inert structures only used by cells as building blocks for construction of the plasma membrane. Over the next 20 years, little was discovered about the importance of PIP2 metabolism in terms of cell signaling, until the mid-1970s when Robert H. Michell hypothesized a connection between the catabolism of PIP2 and increases in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels. He hypothesized that receptor-activated hydrolysis of PIP2 produced a molecule that caused increases in intracellular calcium mobilization. This idea was researched extensively by Michell and his colleagues, who in 1981 were able to show that PIP2 is hydrolyzed into DAG and IP3 by a then unknown phosphodiesterase. In 1984 it was discovered that IP3 acts as a secondary messenger that is capable of traveling through the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it stimulates the release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Further research provided valuable information on the IP3 pathway, such as the discovery in 1986 that one of the many roles of the calcium released by IP3 is to work with DAG to activate protein kinase C (PKC). It was discovered in 1989 that phospholipase C (PLC) is the phosphodiesterase responsible for hydrolyzing PIP2 into DAG and IP3. Today the IP3 signaling pathway is well mapped out, and is known to be important in regulating a variety of calcium-dependent cell signaling pathways. Signaling pathway PLC cleavage of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG initiates intracellular calcium release and PKC activation. Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are often a result of IP3 activation. When a ligand binds to a G protein- coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to a Gq heterotrimeric G protein, the Œ±-subunit of Gq can bind to and induce activity in the PLC isozyme PLC-Œ≤, which results in the cleavage of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG.Biaggioni I., Robertson D. (2011). Chapter 9. Adrenoceptor Agonists & Sympathomimetic Drugs. In: B.G. Katzung, S.B. Masters, A.J. Trevor (Eds), Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 11e. Retrieved October 11, 2011 from . If a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is involved in activating the pathway, the isozyme PLC-Œ≥ has tyrosine residues that can become phosphorylated upon activation of an RTK, and this will activate PLC-Œ≥ and allow it to cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP3. This occurs in cells that are capable of responding to growth factors such as insulin, because the growth factors are the ligands responsible for activating the RTK.Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H. Chapter 2. Overview of Cellular Physiology in Medical Physiology. In: K.E. Barrett, S.M. Barman, S. Boitano, H. Brooks (Eds), Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 23e. . IP3 (also abbreviated Ins(1,4,5)P3 is a soluble molecule and is capable of diffusing through the cytoplasm to the ER, or the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the case of muscle cells, once it has been produced by the action of PLC. Once at the ER, IP3 is able to bind to the IIns(1,4,5)P3 receptor Ins(1,4,5)P3R on a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel that is found on the surface of the ER. The binding of IP3 (the ligand in this case) to Ins(1,4,5)P3R triggers the opening of the Ca2+ channel, and thus release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. In heart muscle cells this increase in Ca2+ activates the ryanodine receptor- operated channel on the SR, results in further increases in Ca2+ through a process known as calcium-induced calcium release. IP3 may also activate Ca2+ channels on the cell membrane indirectly, by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Function =Human= IP3's main functions are to mobilize Ca2+ from storage organelles and to regulate cell proliferation and other cellular reactions that require free calcium. In smooth muscle cells, for example, an increase in concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ results in the contraction of the muscle cell. In the nervous system, IP3 serves as a second messenger, with the cerebellum containing the highest concentration of IP3 receptors. There is evidence that IP3 receptors play an important role in the induction of plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells. = Sea urchin eggs = The slow block to polyspermy in the sea urchin is mediated by the PIP2 secondary messenger system. Activation of the binding receptors activates PLC, which cleaves PIP2 in the egg plasma membrane, releasing IP3 into the egg cell cytoplasm. IP3 diffuses to the ER, where it opens Ca2+ channels. Research =Huntington's disease= Huntington's disease occurs when the cytosolic protein Huntingtin (Htt) has an additional 35 glutamine residues added to its amino terminal region. This modified form of Htt is called Httexp. Httexp makes Type 1 IP3 receptors more sensitive to IP3, which leads to the release of too much Ca2+ from the ER. The release of Ca2+ from the ER causes an increase in the cytosolic and mitochondrial concentrations of Ca2+. This increase in Ca2+ is thought to be the cause of GABAergic MSN degradation. = Alzheimer's disease= Alzheimer's disease involves the progressive degeneration of the brain, severely impacting mental faculties.Alzheimer's Society of Canada. (2009). Alzheimer's Disease:What is Alzheimer's? Retrieved from: http://www.alzheimer.ca/english/disease/whatisit-intro.htm Since the Ca2+ hypothesis of Alzheimer's was proposed in 1994, several studies have shown that disruptions in Ca2+ signaling are the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's disease has been strongly linked to mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. All of the mutated forms of these genes observed to date have been found to cause abnormal Ca2+ signaling in the ER. The functions of PS1 are not yet known, but mutations in PS1 have been shown to increase IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER in several animal models. Calcium channel blockers have been used to treat Alzheimer's disease with some success, and the use of lithium to decrease IP3 turnover has also been suggested as a possible method of treatment.

The show was created by Barry Took and Marty Feldman, who wrote the first three series. The fourth was written by Took, Johnnie Mortimer, Brian Cooke and Donald Webster. Horne's supporting cast comprised Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and, in the first three series, Bill Pertwee. The announcer was Douglas Smith, who also took part in the sketches. All except the last series featured music by Edwin Braden, played by the band \\"the Hornblowers\\", with a song in the middle of each show performed by the close-harmony singing group the Fraser Hayes Four; in the fourth series, the music was by Max Harris with a smaller group of players than the earlier series. The show was the successor to Beyond Our Ken, which had run from 1958 to 1964 with largely the same cast. By the time the new series began, television had become the dominant broadcasting medium in Britain, and Round the Horne, which built up a regular audience of 15 million, was the last radio show to reach so many listeners. Horne was surrounded by larger-than-life characters including the camp pair Julian and Sandy, the disreputable eccentric J.Peasmold Gruntfuttock, and the singer of dubious folk songs, Rambling Syd Rumpo, who all became nationally familiar. The show encountered periodic scrutiny from the BBC management for its double entendres, but consistently received the backing of the director- general of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene. Horne died suddenly in 1969; the BBC decided that Round the Horne could not continue without its star and they cancelled plans for a fifth series that year. Over the following decades Round the Horne has been re-broadcast continually, and all 67 shows have been published on CD. In 2019, in a poll run by Radio Times, Round the Horne was voted the BBC's third-best radio show of any genre, and the best radio comedy series of all. History =Background= In 1957 the radio presenter and comedian Kenneth Horne was the compere on the popular Saturday evening comedy and music radio show Variety Playhouse. The programme's writers were Eric Merriman and Barry Took, and when the series came to an end, they prepared a script for a pilot episode of a new show, Beyond Our Ken. The show, in which Horne was joined by Kenneth Williams, Ron Moody, Hugh Paddick and Betty Marsden, was broadcast in October 1957. The series was due to begin in April 1958, but in February Horne suffered a debilitating stroke; he was temporarily paralysed down his left-hand side and lost the power of speech. The BBC postponed the series. After physiotherapy Horne was able to begin recording Beyond Our Ken in June, in preparation for the broadcast of the first series between July and November. Beyond Our Ken was written around the imperturbable establishment figure of Horne, while the other performers played a \\"spectrum of characters never before heard on the radio\\", including the exaggeratedly upper class Rodney and Charles (Williams and Paddick), the genteel, dotty pensioners Ambrose and Felicity (Williams and Marsden), the hoarse-voiced cook Fanny Haddock ‚Äì a parody of the television cook Fanny Cradock (Marsden), the earthy gardening guru Arthur Fallowfield (Williams), the semi-articulate rock and roll singer Ricky Livid (Paddick) and Hankie Flowered, a parody of the comedian Frankie Howerd (Bill Pertwee). The first episode was not well received by a sample audience, but the BBC decided to back Horne and his team, and the initial six-week contract was extended to 21 weeks. Before the series came to an end, a second had been commissioned to run the following year. After the first series Moody was succeeded by Pertwee; Took left after the second series, leaving Merriman to write the remaining programmes on his own. Feldman in 1972 After the seventh series of Beyond Our Ken ended Horne was scheduled to appear in a number of other BBC programmes; Eric Merriman objected, contending that he had made Horne into a star, and that \\"no other comedy series should be allowed to use him\\", according to Horne's biographer, Barry Johnston. When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the programme Down with Women, Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end. After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together, the BBC commissioned Round the Horne as a replacement on similar lines. They turned to Took, as one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken, and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. The name of the programme came from a pun on Horne's name, combined with the naval term \\"round the Horn\\", meaning to navigate the waters at the southern tip of South America, Cape Horn. The pair aimed to write what they described as \\"down-market material in an upmarket way\\". The scripts they produced led to a faster-paced programme than Beyond Our Ken, which included more allusions to contemporary events, including politics and films. =Format= Round the Horne was based on a revue format, and contained parody and satire. The programme would include an introduction from Horne, who would sometimes give answers to a supposed quiz from the previous week, and then lead into sketches that would include a set- piece based on a film or novel, such as \\"The Man with the Golden Thunderball\\", and \\"The Three Musketeers\\". Martin Dibbs, in his history of the BBC Variety Department, writes that \\"the show was characterised by incessant innuendo and camp representation to an extent never before tolerated within the BBC.\\" As in Beyond Our Ken, there was a cast of recurring characters. Took and Feldman developed new characters for Williams, Paddick, Marsden and Pertwee, whose ability to change between personas produced a programme described by the radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as \\"a cast of thousands played by the same four accomplished actors\\". Horne's role was described in The Daily Telegraph as providing \\"the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy happening all around him\\". The media analysts Frank Krutnik and Steve Neale consider that as such, Horne's role was similar to that of Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Tommy Handley, \\"as a 'stooge' rather than a joke-wielder, frequently switching roles between announcer and in-sketch performer\\". =Broadcasts= 1965‚Äì1966: Series 1 and 2 The first episode of Round the Horne was broadcast on the Light Programme on 7 March 1965. It was described in Radio Times as \\"Five characters in search of the authors\\". The series consisted of 16 episodes and ran to 20 June 1965. The programme was produced by John Simmonds and included music from the Fraser Hayes Four and the studio orchestra, \\"the Hornblowers\\", conducted by Paul Fenoulhet; from episode six, Fenoulhet was replaced by Edwin Braden. Douglas Smith, an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme, was used as the programme's announcer, but was given a larger role as the series progressed; he ended up advertising spoof products and giving human sound effects in addition to his normal role. One of the early episodes included a sketch by Horne, a monologue based on \\"the centenary of the birth of the crumpet\\", including a huge crumpet built for Queen Victoria. > As an added novelty he hollowed out the centre and a Gaiety Girl was > secreted inside. When the loyal toast was drunk, she leapt out, wearing pink > combs and waving a Union Jack ‚Äì either that or the other way round, I don't > remember. In any event the whole affair was a great success and, as many > people commented afterwards 'it was a smashing bit of crumpet'. The sketch angered the strongly-conservative Member of Parliament Sir Cyril Black, who wrote to the BBC to complain. Frank Gillard, the BBC's director of radio, wrote to Dennis Morris, the chief of the Light Programme, asking Round the Horne to \\"watch its step, particularly over the next few weeks and keep itself within reasonable bounds\\". Instead, Took and Feldman wrote a riposte that Horne read at the end of the following programme, addressed to the \\"minority of killjoys\\" who complained: > Let me say to them that our scripts are whiter than white, as is the face of > the producer when he reads them. You see, evil is in the eye of the beholder > ‚Äì and we believe you can make anything sound as if it has a double meaning ‚Äì > if you know how. So cheerio, see you next week. Further complaints about the programme were received and Sir Hugh Greene, the director-general of the BBC, asked to see the scripts before broadcasting. All were returned with the words \\"I see nothing to object to in this\\" written on them. The complaints continued from Black, and from Mary Whitehouse ‚Äì a campaigner against social liberalism ‚Äì about the cast putting emphasis on certain words. Took replied that \\"When Laurence Olivier plays Hamlet he puts emphasis on certain words ‚Äì it's called acting\\". A second series was commissioned, and ran for thirteen weeks, from Sunday 13 March to 5 June 1966. The programme was recorded in front of a studio audience, and Williams would play up to them with physical humour, causing hilarity in the studio. Simmonds spoke to the cast, telling them that the radio audience were hearing unexplained laughter, and to try to keep the visual pranks to a minimum. At the end of the series Roy Rich, the head of BBC Light Entertainments for radio, spoke to Took, Feldman, Horne and Williams and discussed possible changes to the programme, including the removal of the Fraser Hayes Four, and the possible changing of Pertwee and Marsden. No changes were made before the next series was commissioned. On 7 October 1966, at the age of 59, Horne suffered a severe heart attack. He was much weakened, and was unfit to work for three months. As a result, he did not appear in the Round the Horne Christmas special, which was recorded on 28 November. He returned to work in January 1967 to record the third series. 1967‚Äì1968: Series 3 and 4 The third series ran for 21 episodes from 5 February to 25 June 1967. After recording the first episode, Williams wrote in his diary that \\"the script was singularly uninspired I think ‚Äì no innovations or bright ideas for the beginning of a new series ... For the first time I am beginning to feel that this show is rather dated and tired\\". The BBC hierarchy also thought the first show was slightly lacking and Williams was also downbeat after the second recording, writing that \\"I think the show is quite dead artistically and the format has completely atrophied itself ‚Äì it is moribund now. I think I will withdraw after this series\\". Trying to turn the show around, Took and Feldman wrote out the popular camp Julian and Sandy characters (played by Paddick and Williams) from the third episode, but the cast and Simmonds all insisted they were put back, so the writers duly obliged. After a few weeks the show had settled down and Williams recorded in his diary that the recording \\"went v. well. Script was v. good indeed and the audience splendid ‚Äì a great deal of affection there, one felt\\". Feldman became increasingly successful on television, particularly with At Last the 1948 Show (1967); he decided to concentrate on writing and performing on the screen and left the series. Took agreed to stay, and he was joined by Johnnie Mortimer, Brian Cooke and ‚Äì for the first six episodes of the next series ‚Äì Donald Webster. In September 1967 BBC radio was radically reorganised. The Home Service, Third Programme and Light Programme were abolished and replaced by four new national channels ‚Äì Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4; Round the Horne moved from the Light Programme to Radio 2. The change came with reduced budgets. The Fraser Hayes Four and Eddie Braden and the Hornblowers were replaced with a small instrumental group led by Max Harris, and Pertwee was dropped from the programme. The cost fell from ¬£601 a show in series 3 to ¬£486 in series 4. That year's Christmas special was broadcast with the new line-up and writers. The fourth series began on 25 February 1968 and ran for 16 episodes to 9 June. After the first episode Williams was unimpressed with the new material, and wrote in his diary \\"Now there are 4 writers on it! It is unbelievable really. Four! For half an hour of old crap with not a memorable line anywhere ... of course one goes on and flogs it gutless and the rubbish gets by\\". Without Feldman, Took was enjoying the show less than he had previously. He also felt the humour was becoming more obviously dirty and complained to Williams that \\"We might as well write a series called Get Your Cock Out\\". Horne died of a heart attack on 14 February 1969, while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards at the Dorchester hotel in London. An award had gone to Took and Feldman for their television series Marty, and Horne had just urged viewers to tune into the fifth series of Round the Horne ‚Äì which was due to start on 16 March ‚Äì when he fell from the podium. By 24 February 1969 it had been decided that Round the Horne could not continue without its star. As a result, the scripts for series five ‚Äì which Horne had jokingly suggested should be subtitled \\"The First All-Nude Radio Show\\" ‚Äì were hastily adapted into a new series for Williams called Stop Messing About, which ran for two series before it was dropped from the schedule in 1970. Main regular characters The cast of Round the Horne, 1968. Left to right: Hugh Paddick, Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Horne, Betty Marsden, Douglas Smith =Kenneth Horne= The persona adopted by the writers for Horne was not greatly different from his real-life one, and largely the same as that of his Beyond Our Ken character: the urbane, unflappable, tolerant but sometimes surprised central figure, around whom the other characters revolved. The Times called Horne the \\"master of the scandalous double-meaning delivered with shining innocence\\", and in Round the Horne he combined the role of straight man to the flamboyant Julian and Sandy, Rambling Syd Rumpo and J.Peasmold Gruntfuttock with that of genial host of the show. Feldman called him \\"the best straight man I had ever seen\\", who nonetheless had \\"a lot of funny lines\\"; Jonathan Rigby, who played Horne in a stage show, Round the Horne ... Revisited, thought him \\"a stand-up comedian with a posh accent ... part of his genius was that he was able to be himself\\". Horne introduced some programmes by reading out the answers to last week's (non-existent) questions: :The answer to question one: complete the first lines of the following songs ‚Äì \\"If I Were a Blackbird I'd ...\\" The answer is I'd Whistle and Sing, and I positively will not accept any other suggestion. The second song was \\"There's a Rainbow Round My ...\\" Now we got an amazing number of replies to this. We haven't had so many since we asked you to complete \\"Over My Shoulder Goes ...\\" Really, it makes it very difficult for us to keep up the high reputation for sophisticated comedy we've never had. At other times he would give a short lecture on justly forgotten figures from history, such as Robert Capability Lackwind, allegedly the inventor of Toad in the Hole, or Nemesis Fothergill, known to ornithologists ‚Äì and the police ‚Äì as the Birdman of Potter's Bar. In many episodes his opening slot was announcing the day's forthcoming events, such as International free style gnome fingering at the five minute Hippo Wash Brompton Oratory, Swan Upping at Downham and Swan Downing at Upham, and the two-man Rabbi bob sled championship down the escalators at Leicester Square tube station. He would close the programmes by commenting on the final sketch, or announcing a competition to complete a limerick with two fecund opening lines (\\"A young market gardener from Bude, Developed a cactus quite lewd ...\\") or with a public service announcement such as this police message: :If any passer-by in Lisle Street last Saturday night witnessed a middle-aged man stagger out of the Peeperama strip club and get knocked down by a passing cyclist, would you please keep quiet about it as my wife thinks I was in Folkestone. Goodbye. See you next week. =Douglas Smith= At the start of the first series of Round the Horne Douglas Smith took the traditional role of a BBC announcer on comedy shows, introducing the programme and its component parts and reading the credits at the end. As the show developed, the writers gave him more to do. In the second series Smith continually interrupts the programme to promote \\"Dobbiroids Magic Rejuvenators\\" (from \\"the makers of Dobbins Medical Cummerbunds for horses\\") and Dobbimist horse deodorant for UFO (\\"under fetlock odour\\"). In the third and fourth series he is included in the movie spoofs, playing a range of roles including a rumbling volcano: :Horne: ... And see there ‚Äì dominating the island, the sacred volcano of Gonga ‚Äì played by Douglas Smith with a hole in his head and steam coming out of his ears. :Paddick: What an awesome sight ‚Äì snow mantling his mighty summit and lava oozing down his sides. :Smith: That's porridge, actually. I had a hurried breakfast this morning. :Horne: Shut up, Smith, you're a volcano. You just loom over us and rumble ominously. :Smith: Yes, I told you. I had a hurried breakfast. :Horne: Shut up, Smith. :Smith: Rumble rumble. :Horne: That's better. His other roles include a telephone box, an inflatable rubber boat, a drophead Bentley and a cow: :Smith: Moo Moo ‚Äì Splosh! :Horne: Splosh? :Smith: I kicked over the milk pail. By the fourth series Smith has risen to the heights of playing the World (\\"You've just gone through my Khyber Pass travelling on a camel\\"), and in one programme he gets a solo singing spot, barracked by Paddick and Williams (\\"Letting an announcer sing! It's a disgrace!\\") performing \\"Nobody Loves a Fairy When she's Forty\\". =Beatrice, Lady Counterblast, n√©e Clissold= The first of the new characters was an elderly ex-Gaiety Girl (played by Marsden) known as Bea Clissold in her theatrical heyday, when she was \\"the pure brass of the music hall\\", and subsequently an aristocratic widow. She has been much married and much divorced, and has retired to live in seclusion at Chattering Parva, waited on and complained about by her octogenarian butler, Spasm (Williams). Horne interviews her each week in the early programmes, when she reminisces about her life and husbands. In a commentary on the show's characters published in 1974 Took wrote, \\"Her anecdotes of past marriages combine the lurid with the turgid as the narrative flashes back on leaden wings to the turn of the century and the exploits of the young Bea Clissold\\". She appeared in the first programme of the series, and was a major feature of its early episodes. After she ceased to be one of the central characters she continually popped up with her catch phrase, \\"Many times, many, many times\\", originally referring to the number of times she was married, and later an all-purpose innuendo. =Julian and Sandy= The camp pair Julian and Sandy (played by Paddick and Williams) made their debuts in the fourth programme of the first series and rapidly established themselves as a permanent fixture throughout the run of Round the Horne. They are out of work actors whom Horne encounters each week in new temporary jobs. The writers' original idea was that the characters should be elderly and dignified Shakespearean actors filling in as domestic cleaners while \\"resting\\" (i.e. unemployed), but the producer, John Simmonds, thought they seemed rather sad, and at his suggestion Took and Feldman turned the characters into chorus boys. In a typical sketch Horne looks in at a new establishment, usually in Chelsea, with a title such as \\"Bona Tours\\", \\"Bona Books\\", \\"Bona Antiques\\" or \\"Bona Caterers\\", and is greeted with, \\"Oh hello, I'm Julian and this is my friend Sandy\\". The latter adds, using the gay and theatrical slang, palare, \\"How bona to vada your dolly old eek again\\", or \\"What brings you trolling in here?\\" Having first appeared as house cleaners, they are later shown working in a variety of implausible jobs. Took summed them up: \\"From working as part time domestics while 'resting' they progressed to running almost every trendy activity going from fox-hunting in Carnaby Street to the gents' outfitting department of MI5\\". The use of palare enabled the writers to give Julian and Sandy some double entendres that survived BBC censorship because the authorities either did not know or did not admit to knowing their gay meaning. In the fourth series, Sandy tells Horne that Julian is a brilliant pianist: \\"a miracle of dexterity at the cottage upright\\", which to those familiar with gay slang could either refer to pianistic excellence or to ‚Äì illegal ‚Äì sexual activity in a public lavatory. At the time, gay male sex was a criminal offence in Britain. Julian and Sandy became nationally popular characters and are widely credited with contributing a little to the public acceptance of homosexuality that led to the gradual repeal of the anti-gay laws, beginning in 1967. =J. Peasmold Gruntfuttock= A week after the debut of Julian and Sandy came the first appearance of J. Peasmold Gruntfuttock, first broadcast on 5 April 1965. Played by Williams, Gruntfuttock is described by the writers as \\"the walking slum\\". In his first appearance he is a job applicant at the BBC, inspired by voices in his head, and keen to get on close terms with one of the female presenters. In later programmes he is first the king and then dictator of Peasmoldia, a small enclave in the East End, and subsequently Brother Gruntfuttock, member of an obscure religious community. He writes in regularly with incorrect and sometimes physically implausible answers to last week's questions: :Finally, we had \\"I get a kick out of ...\\". Well, Mr Gruntfuttock of Hoxton, I think we all know what you get a kick out of. And on looking at the list you sent me it's my considered opinion that you are running a severe risk of doing yourself a permanent injury. In the fourth series he is a persistent caller of the spoof phone-in, the Round the Horne Forum of the Air, airing his peculiar personal obsessions in between bouts of heavy breathing. He was Feldman's favourite Round the Horne character; the two authors wrote of Gruntfuttock, \\"He married beneath him ‚Äì which gives you some idea what his wife Buttercup (Betty Marsden) must be like. All in all not a couple one would wish to meet on a dark night or indeed at any time.\\" =Charles and Fiona= Charles and Fiona are supposedly characters played by an extremely theatrical actor and actress: \\"ageing juvenile Binkie Huckaback\\" (Paddick) and Dame Celia Molestrangler (Marsden). The two, originally based on the theatre stars Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, were introduced in the eighth programme of the first series, and quickly became a fixture. They appeared in parodies of \\"stiff- upper-lip\\" dramas by No√´l Coward and others; their fictitious plays had titles such as Present Encounter and Bitter Laughter. Their agonised love affairs are punctuated by brittle, staccato dialogue, in which they talk of their emotions in tortuous sentences: :Fiona: All I could think of back here was you out there thinking of me back here thinking of you out there ‚Äì back here. Needing you, wanting you, wanting to need you, needing to want you. :Charles: I don't have the words for it. :Fiona: I know. :Charles: I know you know. :Fiona: I know you know I know. :Charles: Yes, I know. Their sketches customarily end with an unexpected twist, such as the revelation that they are living in a telephone box, or are dining at the Ritz in the nude, or trysting in a refrigerator. Barry Took wrote that they were his own favourite Round the Horne characters. During the second series they were dropped in favour of a new feature, \\"The Seamus Android Show\\" (see below) but were quickly brought back. =Chou En Ginsberg and Lotus Blossom= In the ninth show of the first series Chou En Ginsberg (Williams) appeared for the first time. He is a parody of the stereotypical far-Eastern villain Fu Manchu. The first part of his name was borrowed from Chou En-Lai, the then Chinese premier; for comic contrast the writers wanted an incongruous second name and experimented with \\"Chou En Murphy\\" and \\"Chou En McWhirter\\" before settling on \\"Ginsberg\\". He always announces himself as \\"Dr Chou En Ginsberg, MA (Failed)\\". He appears regularly in the James Bond parodies, \\"Kenneth Horne, Master Spy\\", plotting a fiendish international crime, luring Horne into his clutches but then being outwitted. Chou was joined in the next show by his concubine, Lotus Blossom (Paddick) who is, in the words of her master, common as muck. A drawing of the two by William Hewison in Took and Feldman's 1974 book Round the Horne shows a diminutive Chou alongside a large, looming and graceless Lotus Blossom bulging out of her cheongsam. Her attempts to entertain Special Agent Horne with her songs and dances cause him more distress than Chou's threats of death. =Rambling Syd Rumpo= First heard in the tenth show of the first series, and a fixture thereafter, Rambling Syd (Williams) is an itinerant folk singer. The writers describe him as \\"one of the last of the breed of wandering minstrels who are fast dying out ‚Äì thank heavens\\". Often misappropriating the tunes of genuine folk songs, Rambling Syd's lyrics consist of dubious-sounding nonsense words such as these, from the \\"Runcorn Splod Cobbler's Song\\": :I sing as I cobble and hammer my splod :Tho' my trumice glows hot and my trade be odd :I sit as I gorble and pillock my splee :For a cobbler's life is the life for me. Or, to the tune of \\"Foggy Dew\\": :When I was a young man :I nadgered my splod :As I nurked at the wogglers' trade. :When suddenly I thought :While trussing up my groats, :I'd whirdle with a fair young maid. Took said of the character that his \\"bogus ethnic patter and totally meaningless songs\\" created the illusion of \\"something terribly naughty going on\\" ‚Äì but that any naughtiness was in fact in the listener's mind. =Daphne Whitethigh= The character was loosely based on the television cook Fanny Cradock. Described by Took and Feldman as \\"fashion reporter, TV cook, agony aunt, pain in the neck\\", Daphne Whitethigh (Marsden) is a hoarse-voiced pundit, \\"whose advice on the placing of the bosom or the way to prepare Hippo in its shell is an absolute must for all those trendy moderns who want to look and feel frightful\\". Among her helpful cooking tips are that although rhinoceros is not very appetising you do get marvellous crackling; her recipes for yak include yak √† l'orange, yak in its jacket, and coupe yak. She advises followers of female fashion that bosoms are still out, but may be on the way back (Horne says he will keep a light burning in the window) and her other useful pointers include how to use cold cream to remove those baboon claw marks from one's hip, and how to avoid crow's feet round the eyes: refrain from sleeping in trees. =Seamus Android= Described by Took as \\"an unskilled television labourer whose gift of the blarney and wistful Irish charm could empty any theatre in three minutes\\", Seamus Android is a parody of the broadcaster Eamonn Andrews, whose weekly television chat show was broadcast live on Sunday evenings. Took and Feldman had appeared on Andrews's show and been astonished by \\"the non sequiturs and other nonsense he came out with\\". Seamus Android was the only regular character played by Pertwee, who was otherwise cast as what Took called \\"the odds and ends\\" ‚Äì the minor characters and straight parts. Android's interviewees include the much married actress Zsa-Zsa Poltergeist, the Hollywood producer Daryll F. Klaphanger, and the star of The Ipswich File, Michael Bane; promised appearances by such as Lord Ghenghiz Wilkinson, the dancing cloakroom attendant, Nemesis Poston, the juggling monk, and Anthony Wormwood-Nibblo, the Hoxton cat thief and heiress fail to materialise. As Pertwee was not in the cast for the last series, Android was dropped. =Dentures= Played by Paddick, this is the only regular Round the Horne character who had in all essentials already appeared in Beyond Our Ken, where he was named Stanley Birkinshaw. In Round the Horne he has no regular name, and appears in various capacities. He is a man with ill-fitting false teeth; his diction distorts all sibilants, and sprays saliva in all directions. Dentures often opens the show in the style of a toastmaster (\\"My lordsh, ladiesh and gentlemen,\\" etc). In the second series he appears as \\"The Great Omipaloni, the world's fastest illusionist ‚Äì and also the dampest\\". In the third series he is Buffalo Sidney Goosecreature, adversary of the Palone Ranger, and in the fourth he is Angus McSpray (\\"Rishe againsht the Shasshenachsh\\") to Williams's Bonnie Prince Charlie. =Julie Coolibah= The invention of Mortimer and Cooke, Julie Coolibah (Marsden) appears in the fourth season. She is an Australian visiting London, deeply suspicious of British men (\\"I know you Pommies are sex mad\\"). Every time she talks to Horne she interprets his innocent remarks as sexual overtures: :Horne: Good to have you back. :Julie: What do you mean by that? :Horne: Nothing, just extending the hand of friendship. :Julie: Yeah? With what purpose in mind, might I ask? When Julie manages to find work in London she has constant difficulties coping with the men. As a bus conductress she is outraged when a passenger gives her fourpence and asks \\"How far can I go for that?\\" She tells Horne, \\"I cracked him with my cash-bag and put him off\\". Critical reception Round the Horne is described by Foster and Furst as \\"one of the seminal comedies to come out of the BBC\\". The programme continued the comedy vein of The Goon Show and provided an influential link, through I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, to the work of the Monty Python writers and performers; at one point Monty Python was given the working title Barry Took's Flying Circus by the BBC. Round the Horne helped change the way the BBC dealt with broadcasting humour: \\"The ebullience of the ... comedy ‚Äì not to mention the filth of the innuendos ‚Äì swept away decades of insipid and paternalistic inhibition at the BBC\\", according to Richard Morrison, the chief arts correspondent of The Times. Six years after the last series was first broadcast, The Daily Mirror called Round the Horne \\"the last great radio show\\". In 2002 The Spectator described it as \\"one of the great radio successes\\"; the following year William Cook wrote in The Guardian that the show, \\"boasted a wonderful writing team\\" and \\"bestrode the airwaves like a colossus, reaching an audience of 15 million ‚Äì the sort of ratings most current comedies can only dream about.\\" In 2005 The Sunday Times referred to it as \\"One of the best-loved shows of all time.\\" Punch commented that the series was probably the last comedy show on radio to have a huge following. According to Took, Round the Horne was broadcast when radio was considered to be on the wane when compared to television; such was the show's popularity, many thought radio would continue to be a leading form of entertainment. Although Round the Horne attracted some adverse comments from Black, Whitehouse and others of similar views, the show was well received by the press. In 1967 The Times called it \\"half an hour of the purest impure entertainment\\", and as the third series came to an end the paper called for a Christmas special and a further series in the new year. \\"No-one, but no-one at all has yet presented those elegant queens, those touchily vulnerable bona- boys, those fashion fetichists so deftly, so pointedly, and, in the final accounting, so purely\\". In 1969 the paper commented that the show was \\"a success with lovers of the sophisticated pun\\" as well as appealing to \\"those who like a good belly laugh\\", with \\"obvious jokes ... mixed with clever word juggling\\". In 1995, looking back at British radio comedy, The Guardian placed Round the Horne first in its list of the five greatest shows. In 2019, in a poll run by Radio Times, Round the Horne was voted the third best radio show of any kind, and the best comedy. Legacy =Recordings= Recordings of all the episodes have been issued on CD by the BBC in its \\"Audiobooks\\" publications (2002): * Series 1: * Series 2: * Series 3: * Series 4: In 2005, to mark the 40th anniversary of the show, the BBC published a boxed set containing all episodes, on 35 CDs, with an accompanying 3-hour, 3-disc set \\"Round The Horne: The Complete and Utter History\\", written and narrated by Took: By 2006 over half a million copies of tapes and CDs of Round the Horne had been sold by the BBC. Editions of Round the Horne are regularly broadcast on the digital radio service BBC Radio 4 Extra. =Scripts= Some scripts from all four series have been published.

It contains the scripts of thirteen Julian and Sandy sketches: * Bona Books (from series 2, programme 2) * Bona Prods (from series 3, programme 10) * Bona Bijou Tourettes (from series 3, programme 12) * La Casserole de Bona Gourmet (from series 3, programme 15) * Bona Hunt (from series 3, programme 14) * Fabe Homes and Bona Gardens (from series 1, programme 10) * Bona Tattoos (from series 2, programme 3) * The Ballet Bona (from series 2, programme 9) * Bona Grapplers (from series 2, programme 10) * Bona Law (from series 3, programme 2) * Bona Pets (from series 2, programme 13) * Bona Palare (from series 4, programme 13) * Bona Performers (from series 2, programme 13) :Source: The Bona Book of Julian and Sandy. =Spin off= Three weeks after the fourth series of Round the Horne finished, the first episode of Horne A'Plenty was broadcast on the ITV channel. In a sketch show format, and with Took as script editor (and later producer), this was an attempt to translate the spirit of Round the Horne to television, although with different actors supporting Horne: Graham Stark, for example, substituted for Williams and Sheila Steafel for Marsden. The first six-part series ran from 22 June to 27 July 1968, the second from 27 November to 1 January 1969. =Adaptations= Round the Horne ... Revisited A stage version, Round the Horne ... Revisited, was adapted from the original radio scripts by Brian Cooke, the last surviving writer of the series, and directed by Michael Kingsbury. It was first produced in October 2003 at the White Bear, a fringe theatre in south London, and opened in the West End at The Venue, Leicester Square in January 2004, running for more than a year. It featured Jonathan Rigby as Horne, Robin Sebastian as Williams, Nigel Harrison as Paddick, Kate Brown as Marsden and Charles Armstrong as Smith. A scene from the show featured in the 2004 Royal Variety Performance at the London Coliseum. Following the success of the London production, a second cast was assembled to tour the provinces. Stephen Critchlow played Horne, with Stephen Matthews, David Rumelle, Felicity Duncan and Oliver Beamish as Williams, Paddick, Marsden and Smith. The original show ran in London until December 2004, when it was replaced by a Christmas edition with an unchanged cast. A third edition, Round the Horne Revisited 2, rounded off the London run from February to April 2005, and then made a provincial tour. The original version of the stage play was filmed by the BBC; the television director was Nick Wood. The programme was first transmitted on BBC Four on 13 June 2004 and was repeated ten times on Four or BBC Two over the next four years. Other stage versions In 2008 Barry Took's former wife, Lyn, and the director Richard Baron prepared a new stage adaptation, Round the Horne ‚Äì Unseen and Uncut, which drew entirely on Took and Feldman material from series one to three. It toured in 2008 and 2009. The cast included, from the 2004 show, Rigby as Horne, Sebastian as Williams and Harrison as Paddick (later succeeded by David Delve), with Pertwee's characters ‚Äì all omitted from the 2004 show ‚Äì restored, played by Michael Shaw; Stephen Boswell played Smith. Unlike the 2004 production, it had a six-strong cast, augmented by a group of vocalists and musicians in the roles of the Hornblowers and the Fraser Hayes Four. In 2015, to mark 50 years since the radio series began, Apollo Theatre Company produced a stage adaptation, Round the Horne: The 50th Anniversary Tour, compiled from the original scripts and directed by Tim Astley. The cast comprised Julian Howard McDowell (Horne), Colin Elmer (Williams), Jonathan Hansler (Paddick), Eve Winters (Marsden) and Nick Wymer (Smith). =Documentaries= A 45-minute BBC radio documentary, Round and Round the Horne, was broadcast on 18 September 1976. It was presented by Frank Bough and included interviews with Williams and Took. A 60-minute radio documentary, Horne A' Plenty, was broadcast on 14 February 1994. It was presented by Leslie Phillips and included new interviews with Marsden and Took and archive material featuring Horne. A three-hour radio special, Horne of Plenty, was broadcast on 5 March 2005 for the 40th anniversary of the show. It was presented by Jonathan James-Moore and included interviews with Ron Moody, Pertwee, Merriman's son Andy, Cooke, Lyn Took, and extracts from Williams's diary read \\"in character\\" by David Benson. The special included the first and final episodes of Beyond Our Ken and Round the Horne in their entirety. =Contribution to British vocabulary= Round the Horne is cited as a source in 38 entries in The Oxford English Dictionary. Rambling Syd is quoted in the entry for \\"nadger\\": \\"In plural. The testicles. 'Now my dearios, I'll tether my nadgers to a grouting pole for the old grey mare is grunging in the meadow' ‚Äì from a comedy monologue by the character 'Rambling Syd Rumpo' whose material is characterized by the use of nonsense words with a general air of sexual innuendo; the meaning is intentionally vague.\\" Rambling Syd's surname is also cited: \\"rumpo\\", \\"n. Brit. slang. = rumpy-pumpy n. Perhaps influenced by the name of 'Rambling Syd Rumpo', a character (played by Kenneth Williams) in the British radio series Round the Horne (1965‚Äì9 ), whose songs, although largely consisting of nonsense words, often had an air of sexual innuendo.\\" Julian and Sandy are cited among the sources for a range of palare words, including \\"bona\\" (Good, excellent; attractive), \\"naff\\" (Unfashionable, vulgar; lacking in style, inept; worthless, faulty), \\"nante\\" (Nothing), \\"omee\\" (Man ‚Äì spelled \\"omi\\" by Took and Feldman) and \\"palone\\" (A young woman. Also: an effeminate man).

Now somewhat dated, and sometimes avoided as being potentially offensive.\\"). The causes of mental disorders are regarded as complex and varying depending on the particular disorder and the individual. Although the causes of most mental disorders are not fully understood, researchers have identified a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that can contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders. Most mental disorders are a result of a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.Lee Anna Clark, et al., \\"Three Approaches to Understanding and Classifying Mental Disorder: ICD-11, DSM-5, and the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)\\" (PDF), Psychological Science in the Public Interest 18, no. 2 (2017), 75. https://doi.org/10.1177/1529100617727266 (\\"... research has shown that psychopathology generally arises from multiple biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and cultural factors, all interacting in complex ways and filtered through an individual‚Äôs lifetime of experience. Research also has shown that the outcomes of these factors and their interactions are not clearly definable, distinct diseases, but are instead complex and variable combinations of psychological problems.\\") Research results Risk factors for mental illness include, psychological trauma, adverse childhood experiences, genetic predisposition and personality traits. Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include almost all psychoactive substances, e.g., cannabis, alcohol and caffeine. Particular mental illnesses have particular risk factors, for instance including unequal parental treatment, adverse life events and drug use in depression, migration and discrimination, childhood trauma, bereavement or separation in families, and cannabis use in schizophrenia and psychosis, and parenting factors, child abuse, family history (e.g. of anxiety), and temperament and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) in anxiety. Many psychiatric disorders include problems with impulse and other emotional control. In February 2013 a study found common genetic links between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter systems are also responsible for some mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and glutamate system's abnormal functioning. Differences have also been found in the size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as cognitive (e.g. reasoning) biases, emotional influences, personality dynamics, temperament and coping style. Studies have indicated that variation in genes can play an important role in the development of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health. Adverse experiences affect a person's mental health, including abuse, neglect, bullying, social stress, traumatic events and other negative or overwhelming life experiences. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated, including employment problems, socioeconomic inequality, lack of social cohesion, problems linked to migration, and features of particular societies and cultures. In nowadays mental stress is a major cause of mental illnesses, so it's very important to cope with mental stress, and for that yoga, excercise and some medications may help. Theories =General theories= There are a number of theories or models seeking to explain the causes (etiology) of mental disorders. These theories may differ in regards to how they explain the cause of the disorder, how they treat the disorder, and their basic classification of mental disorders. There may also be differences in philosophy of mind regarding whether, or how, the mind is considered separately from the brain. During most of the 20th century, mental illness was believed to be caused by problematic relationships between children and their parents. This view was held well into the late 1990s, in which people still believed this child-parent relationship was a large determinant of severe mental illness, such as depression and schizophrenia. In the 21st century additional factors have been identified such as genetic contributions, though experience always also plays a role. So, the perceived causes of mental illness have changed over time and will most likely continue to alter while more research is done in this area. Outside the West, community approaches remain a focus. A practical mixture of models may often be used to explain particular issues and disorders, although there may be difficulty defining boundaries for indistinct psychiatric syndromes. =Medical or biomedical model= An overall distinction is also commonly made between a \\"medical model\\" (also known as a biomedical or disease model) and a \\"social model\\" (also known as an empowerment or recovery model) of mental disorder and disability, with the former focusing on hypothesized disease processes and symptoms, and the latter focusing on hypothesized social constructionism and social contexts. Biological psychiatry has tended to follow a biomedical model focused on organic or \\"hardware\\" pathology of the brain, where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience. =Biopsychosocial model= The primary model of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is the biopsychosocial model (BPS), which integrates biological, psychological and social factors. A related view, the diathesis-stress model, posits that mental disorders result from genetic dispositions and environmental stressors, combining to cause patterns of distress or dysfunction. =Psychoanalytic theories= Psychoanalytic theories focus on unresolved internal and relational conflicts. These theories have been posited as overall explanations of mental disorder, although today most psychoanalytic groups are said to adhere to the biopsychosocial model and to accept an eclectic mix of subtypes of psychoanalysis. The psychoanalytic theory was originated by Sigmund Freud. This theory focuses on the impact of unconscious forces on human behavior. According to Freud, the personality is made up of three parts: the id, ego, and superego. The id operates under the pleasure principle, the ego operates under the reality principle, and the superego is the \\"conscience\\" and incorporates what is and is not socially acceptable into a person's value system. Also, according to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psycho-sexual development that everyone goes through: the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latency stage, and genital stage. Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psycho-sexual developmental stages. When this happens, the individual is said to be fixated in that developmental stage. =Attachment theory= Attachment theory is a kind of evolutionary- psychological approach sometimes applied in the context for mental disorders, which focuses on the role of early caregiver-child relationships, responses to danger, and the search for a satisfying reproductive relationship in adulthood. According to this theory, the more secure a child's attachment is to a nurturing adult, the more likely that child will maintain healthy relationships with others in their life. As found by the Strange Situation experiment run by Mary Ainsworth based on the formulations of John Bowlby, there are four main patterns of attachment: secure attachment, avoidant attachment, disorganized attachment and ambivalent attachment. These attachment patterns are found cross-culturally.Vondra, J. I., & Barnett, D. (1999). A typical attachment in infancy and early childhood among children at developmental risk. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 64 (3, Serial No. 258). Later research found a fourth pattern of attachment known as disorganized disoriented attachment. Secure attachments reflect trust in the child-caretaker relationship while insecure attachment reflects mistrust. The security of attachment in a child affects the child's emotional, cognitive, and social competence later in life. =Evolutionary psychology= Evolutionary psychology and evolutionary psychiatry posit that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones. Behavioral abnormalities that resemble human mental illness have been found in closely related species (great apes). Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including enhancing creativity and stress to enhance survival by easily activating the flight-or-fight response in anticipation of danger. Schizophrenia could have been beneficial in prehistoric times by improving creativity during stressful times, or by helping to disseminate delusional tales that would have aided in group cohesion and finding gullible mates. The paranoia associated with Schizophrenia could have prevented danger from other humans and other animals. Mania and depression could have benefited from seasonal changes by helping to increase energy levels during times of plenty and rejuvenating energy during times of scarcity. In this way mania was activated during the spring and summer to facilitate energy for hunting and depression worked best during the winter, similar to how bears hibernate in the winter to recover their energy levels. This may explain the connection between circadian genes and Bipolar Disorder and may explain the connection between light and seasonal affective disorder. =Factors affecting choices= Some psychiatrists might favour biomedical models because they believe such models make their discipline seem more esteemed. Biological factors Biological factors consist of anything physical that can cause adverse effects on a person's mental health. This includes genetics, prenatal damage, infections, exposure to toxins, brain defects or injuries, and substance abuse. Many professionals believe that the sole cause of mental disorders is based upon the biology of the brain and the nervous system. Mind mentions genetic factors, long-term physical health conditions, and head injuries or epilepsy (affecting behaviour and mood) as factors that may possibly trigger an episode of mental illness. =Genetics= Family-linkage and twin studies have indicated that genetic factors often play an important role in the development of mental disorders. The reliable identification of specific genetic susceptibility to particular disorders, through linkage or association studies, has proven difficult. This has been reported to be likely due to the complexity of interactions between genes, environmental events, and early development or to the need for new research strategies. The heritability of behavioral traits associated with mental disorder may be greater in permissive than in restrictive environments, and susceptibility genes probably work through both \\"within-the-skin\\" (physiological) pathways and \\"outside-the-skin\\" (behavioral and social) pathways. Investigations increasingly focus on links between genes and endophenotypes‚Äîmore specific traits (including neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological)‚Äîrather than disease categories. With regard to a prominent mental disorder, schizophrenia, for a long time consensus among scientists was that certain alleles (forms of genes) were responsible for schizophrenia, but some research has indicated only multiple, rare mutations thought to alter neurodevelopmental pathways that can ultimately contribute to schizophrenia; virtually every rare structural mutation was different in each individual. Research has shown that many conditions are polygenic meaning there are multiple defective genes rather than only one that are responsible for a disorder. Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's are both examples of hereditary mental disorders. The increasing understanding of brain plasticity (neuroplasticity) raises questions of whether some brain differences may be caused by mental illnesses, rather than pre-existing and causing them. =Prenatal damage= Any damage that occurs to a fetus while still in its mother's womb is considered prenatal damage. If the pregnant mother uses drugs or alcohol or is exposed to illnesses or infections then mental disorders can develop in the fetus. According to research, certain conditions, such as autism result from a disruption of early fetal brain progression. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have been linked to an increased development of mental illness in the offspring. This includes maternal exposure to serious psychological stress or trauma, conditions of famine, obstetric birth complications, infections, and gestational exposure to alcohol or cocaine. Such factors have been hypothesized to affect specific areas of neurodevelopment within the general developmental context and to restrict neuroplasticity. =Infection, disease and toxins= A number of psychiatric disorders have often been tentatively linked with microbial pathogens, particularly viruses; however while there have been some suggestions of links from animal studies, and some inconsistent evidence for infectious and immune mechanisms (including prenatally) in some human disorders, infectious disease models in psychiatry are reported to have not yet shown significant promise except in isolated cases. There have been some inconsistent findings of links between infection by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and human mental disorders such as schizophrenia, with the direction of causality unclear. A number of diseases of the white matter can cause symptoms of mental disorder. Poorer general health has been found among individuals with severe mental illnesses, thought to be due to direct and indirect factors including diet, bacterial infections, substance use, exercise levels, effects of medications, socioeconomic disadvantages, lowered help-seeking or treatment adherence, or poorer healthcare provision. Some chronic general medical conditions have been linked to some aspects of mental disorder, such as AIDS- related psychosis. The current research on Lyme disease caused by a deer tick, and related toxins, is expanding the link between bacterial infections and mental illness.Mental Disorders: MedlinePlus Research shows that infections and exposure to toxins such as HIV and streptococcus cause dementia and OCD respectively. The infections or toxins trigger a change in the brain chemistry, which can develop into a mental disorder. =Injury and brain defects= Any damage to the brain can cause a mental disorder. The brain is the control system for the nervous system and the rest of the body. Without it the body cannot function properly. Higher rates of mood, psychotic, and substance abuse disorders have been found following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Findings on the relationship between TBI severity and prevalence of subsequent psychiatric disorders have been inconsistent, and occurrence has been linked to prior mental health problems as well as direct neurophysiological effects, in a complex interaction with personality and attitude and social influences. Head trauma is classified as either open or closed head injury. In open head injury the skull is penetrated and brain tissue is destroyed in a localized area. Closed head injury is more common, the skull is not penetrated but there is an impact of the brain against the skull which can create permanent structural damage (e.g. subdural hematoma). With both types, symptoms may disappear or persist over time. It has been found that typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of post-traumatic amnesia the worse the prognosis for the individual. The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the type of injury (either open head injury or closed head injury) and the amount of tissue destroyed. Symptoms of closed injury head trauma tend to be the experience of intellectual deficits in abstract reasoning ability, judgement, and memory, and also marked personality changes. Symptoms of open injury head trauma tend to be the experience of classic neuropsychological syndromes like aphasia, visual-spatial disorders, and types of memory or perceptual disorders. Brain tumors are classified as either malignant and benign, and as intrinsic (directly infiltrate the parenchyma of the brain) or extrinsic (grows on the external surface of the brain and produces symptoms as a result of pressure on the brain tissue). Progressive cognitive changes associated with brain tumors may include confusion, poor comprehension, and even dementia. Symptoms tend to depend on the location of the tumor on the brain. For example, tumors on the frontal lobe tend to be associated with the symptoms of impairment of judgment, apathy, and loss of the ability to regulate/modulate behavior. Findings have indicated abnormal functioning of brainstem structures in individuals with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, and other disorders that have to do with impairments in maintaining sustained attention. Some abnormalities in the average size or shape of some regions of the brain have been found in some disorders, reflecting genes and/or experience. Studies of schizophrenia have tended to find enlarged ventricles and sometimes reduced volume of the cerebrum and hippocampus, while studies of (psychotic) bipolar disorder have sometimes found increased amygdala volume. Findings differ over whether volumetric abnormalities are risk factors or are only found alongside the course of mental health problems, possibly reflecting neurocognitive or emotional stress processes and/or medication use or substance use. Some studies have also found reduced hippocampal volumes in major depression, possibly worsening with time depressed. =Neurotransmitter systems= Abnormal levels of dopamine activity have been correlated with a number of disorders (e.g., reduced in ADHD and OCD, and increased in schizophrenia). Dysfunction in serotonin and other monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine and dopamine), and their associated neural networks, are also moderately correlated with certain mental disorders, including major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Studies of depleted levels of monoamine neurotransmitters show an association with depression and other psychiatric disorders, but \\"... it should be questioned whether 5-HT [serotonin] represents just one of the final, and not the main, factors in the neurological chain of events underlying psychopathological symptoms....\\" Marazziti, D. (2017). Understanding the role of serotonin in psychiatric diseases. F1000Research, 6, 180. doi:10.12688/f1000research.10094.1 PMC5325064. Simplistic \\"chemical imbalance\\" explanations for mental disorders have never received empirical support; and most prominent psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have not espoused such ill-defined, facile etiological theories. Instead, neurotransmitter systems have been understood in the context of the diathesis- stress or biopsychosocial models. The following 1967 quote from renowned psychiatric and neuroscience researchers exemplifies this more sophisticated understanding (in contrast to the woolly \\"chemical imbalance\\" notion). > Whereas specific genetic factors may be of importance in the etiology of > some, and possibly all, depressions, it is equally conceivable that early > experiences of the infant or child may cause enduring biochemical changes, > and that these may predispose some individuals to depressions in adulthood. > It is not likely that changes in the metabolism of the biogenic amines alone > will account for the complex phenomena of normal or pathological > affect.Schildkraut, J. J., & Kety, S. S. (1967). Biogenic amines and > emotion. Science, 156(3771), 21-30. =Substance abuse= Substance abuse, especially long-term abuse, can cause or exacerbate many mental disorders. Alcoholism is linked to depression while abuse of amphetamines and LSD can leave a person feeling paranoid and anxious. Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include cannabis, alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine use is correlated with anxiety and suicide. Illicit drugs have the ability to stimulate particular parts of the brain which can affect development in adolescence. Cannabis has been found to worsen depression and lessen an individual's motivation. Alcohol has the potential to damage \\"white matter\\" in the brain which affects thinking and memory. Alcohol has been found to be a serious problem in many countries due to many people participating in excessive drinking or binge drinking. Life experience and environmental factors The term \\"environment\\" is very loosely defined when it comes to mental illness. Unlike biological and psychological causes, environmental causes are stressors that individuals deal with in everyday life. These stressors range from financial issues to having low self-esteem. Environmental causes are more psychologically based thus making them more closely related. Events that evoke feelings of loss or damage are most likely to cause a mental disorder to develop in an individual. Environmental factors include but are not limited to dysfunctional home life, poor relationships with others, substance abuse, not meeting social expectations, low self-esteem and poverty. Mind mentions childhood abuse, trauma, violence or neglect, social isolation, loneliness or discrimination, the death of someone close, stress, homelessness or poor housing, social disadvantage, poverty or debt, unemployment, caring for a family member or friend, significant trauma as an adult, such as military combat, and being involved in a serious accident or being the victim of a violent crime as possibly triggering an episode of mental illness. Repeating generational patterns have been found to be a risk factor for mental illness. =Life events and emotional stress= It is reported that treatment in childhood and in adulthood, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence and bullying, has been linked to the development of mental disorders, through a complex interaction of societal, family, psychological and biological factors. Negative or stressful life events more generally have been implicated in the development of a range of disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. The main risks appear to be from a cumulative combination of such experiences over time, although exposure to a single major trauma can sometimes lead to psychopathology, including PTSD. Resilience to such experiences varies, and a person may be resistant to some forms of experience but susceptible to others. Features associated with variations in resilience include genetic vulnerability, temperamental characteristics, cognitive set, coping patterns, and other experiences. For bipolar disorder, stress (such as childhood adversity) is not a specific cause, but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness. =Poor parenting, abuse and neglect= Poor parenting has been found to be a risk factor for depression and anxiety. Separation or bereavement in families, and childhood trauma, have been found to be risk factors for psychosis and schizophrenia. Severe psychological trauma such as abuse can wreak havoc on a person's life. Children are much more susceptible to psychological harm from traumatic events than adults. Once again, the reaction to the trauma will vary based on the person as well as the individual's age. The impact of these events is influenced by several factors: the type of event, the length of exposure the individual had to the event, and the extent to which the individual and their family/friends were personally affected by the event. Human-caused disasters, such as a tumultuous childhood affect children more than natural disasters Neglect is a type of maltreatment related to the failure to provide needed, age-appropriate care, supervision and protection. It is not to be confused with abuse, which, in this context, is defined as any action that intentionally harms or injures another person.medical-dictionary.com Neglect most often happens during childhood by the parents or caretakers. Oftentimes, parents who are guilty of neglect were also neglected as children. The long- term effects of neglect are reduced physical, emotional, and mental health in a child and throughout adulthood. =Adverse childhood experiences= Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as physical or emotional neglect or both, abuse, poverty, malnutrition, and traumatic experiences can have long-lasting negative consequences. Adverse experiences in childhood can affect the structural and functional development of the brain, giving structural and functional abnormalities in later life, and in adulthood. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study has shown a strong dose‚Äìresponse relationship between ACEs and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout a person's lifespan, including suicide attempts and frequency of depressive episodes. A number of adverse childhood experiences can give a level of stress known as toxic stress. A child's neurological development can be disrupted when chronically exposed to stressful events such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, witnessing violence in the household, or a parent being incarcerated or suffering from a mental illness. As a result, the child's cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired. Over time, the child may adopt various harmful coping strategies that can contribute to later disease and disability. Childhood adversity is also associated with an increased risk for developing severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, and it has been suggested that it could contribute to some features of the illness, including cognitive impairment. Findings from several studies have been mixed but some suggest that cognitive impairment is more related to forms of neglect than any other form of adversity. Underlying mechanisms remain unknown. =Relationships= Relationship issues have been consistently linked to the development of mental disorders, with continuing debate on the relative impact of the home environment or work/school and peer groups. Issues with parenting skills or parental depression or other problems may be a risk factor. Parental divorce appears to increase risk, perhaps only if there is family discord or disorganization, although a warm supportive relationship with one parent may compensate. Details of infant feeding, weaning, toilet training etc. do not appear to be importantly linked to psychopathology. Early social privation, or lack of ongoing, harmonious, secure, committed relationships, have been implicated in the development of mental disorders. Some approaches, such as certain theories of co-counseling, may see all non-neurological mental disorders as the result of the self-regulating mechanisms of the mind (which accompany the physical expression of emotions) not being allowed to operate. How an individual interacts with others as well as the quality of relationships can greatly increase or decrease a person's quality of living. Continuous fighting with friends and family can all lead to an increased risk of developing a mental illness. A dysfunctional family may include disobedience, child neglect and/or abuse which occurs regularly. These types of families are often a product of an unhealthy co-dependent relationship on the part of the head of the household (usually to drugs). Losing a loved one, especially at an early age can have lasting effects on an individual. The individual may feel fear, guilt, anger or loneliness. This can drive a person into solitude and depression. They may turn to alcohol and drugs to cope with their feelings. Divorce is also another factor that can take a toll on both children and adults alike. Divorcees may suffer from emotional adjustment problems due to a loss of intimacy and social connections. Newer statistics show that the negative effects of divorce have been greatly exaggerated. The effects of divorce in children are based on three main factors: the quality of their relationship with each of their parents before the separation, the intensity and duration of the parental conflict, and the parents' ability to focus on the needs of children in their divorce. =Social expectations and esteem= How individuals view themselves ultimately determines who they are, their abilities and what they can be. Having both too low of self-esteem as well as too high of one can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. A person's self-esteem plays a much larger role in their overall happiness and quality of life. Poor self-esteem whether it be too high or too low can result in aggression, violence, self-deprecating behavior, anxiety, and other mental disorders. Not fitting in with the masses can result in bullying and other types of emotional abuse. Bullying can result in depression, feelings of anger, loneliness. =Poverty= Studies show that there is a direct correlation between poverty and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people are actually two to three times more likely to develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. Low levels of self-efficiency and self- worth are commonly experienced by children of disadvantaged families or those from the economic underclass. Theorists of child development have argued that persistent poverty leads to high levels of psychopathology and poor self- concepts. This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in- group demographic differences that they may possess. These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that are associated with mental health. According to findings there is a strong association between poverty and substance abuse. Substance abuse only perpetuates a continuous cycle. It can make it extremely difficult for individuals to find and keep jobs. As stated earlier, both financial problems and substance abuse can cause mental illnesses to develop.Substance Abuse and Poverty Addiction =Communities and cultures= Mental disorders have been linked to the overarching social, economic and cultural system. Some non- Western views take this community approach. Problems in communities or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, lack of social cohesion, and migration, have been associated with the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position (socioeconomic status (SES) or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings on the nature of the links and on the extent to which pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional- level income levels. The causal role of different socioeconomic factors may vary by country. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the drift hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted. Psychological and individual factors, including resilience Some clinicians believe that psychological characteristics alone determine mental disorders. Others speculate that abnormal behavior can be explained by a mix of social and psychological factors. In many examples, environmental and psychological triggers complement one another resulting in emotional stress, which in turn activates a mental illness Each person is unique in how they will react to psychological stressors. What may break one person may have little to no effect on another. Psychological stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect and being unable to relate to others. The inability to relate to others is also known as emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their own feelings. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit neurotic. Oftentimes, the inability to relate to others stems from a traumatic event. Mental characteristics of individuals, as assessed by both neurological and psychological studies, have been linked to the development and maintenance of mental disorders. This includes cognitive or neurocognitive factors, such as the way a person perceives, thinks or feels about certain things; or an individual's overall personality, temperament or coping style or the extent of protective factors or \\"positive illusions\\" such as optimism, personal control and a sense of meaning.

He has been Middle East correspondent intermittently since 1976 for various media; since 1989 he has been correspondent for The Independent, based in Beirut. Fisk has many British and international journalism awards, including the Press Awards Foreign Reporter of the Year seven times. He is an author and has reported on wars and armed conflicts. An Arabic speaker, he was among the few Western journalists to interview Osama bin Laden, which he did three times between 1993 and 1997. Early life and education Fisk was an only child, born in Maidstone, Kent. His father William ('Bill') Fisk (1899‚Äì1992) was Borough Treasurer at Maidstone Corporation and had fought in the First World War. At the end of the war Bill Fisk was punished for disobeying an order to execute another soldier; \\"My father's refusal to kill another man was the only thing he did in his life which I would also have done.\\" Though his father said little about his part in the war, it held a fascination for his son. After his father's death, he discovered him to have been the scribe of his battalion's war diaries from August 1918. Robert Fisk was educated at Yardley Court, a preparatory school, then at Sutton Valence School and Lancaster University, where he worked on the student magazine John O'Gauntlet. He gained a PhD in Political Science, from Trinity College, Dublin in 1983; the title of his doctoral thesis was \\"A condition of limited warfare: √âire's neutrality and the relationship between Dublin, Belfast and London, 1939‚Äì1945\\". Career =Newspaper correspondent= Fisk worked on the Sunday Express diary column before a disagreement with the editor, John Junor, prompted a move to The Times. From 1972 to 1975, at the height of the Troubles, Fisk was The Times Belfast correspondent, before being posted to Portugal following the Carnation Revolution in 1974. He then was appointed Middle East correspondent (1976‚Äì1988). In addition to the Troubles and Portugal, he reported the Iranian revolution in 1979. When a story of his was spiked (Iran Air Flight 655) after Rupert Murdoch's takeover, he moved to The Independent in April 1989. The New York Times once described Robert Fisk as \\"probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain\\". =War reporting= Robert Fisk at the Al Jazeera Forum in 2010 Fisk has lived in Beirut since 1976, remaining throughout the Lebanese Civil War. He was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, as well as the Syrian Hama Massacre. His book on the Lebanese conflict, Pity the Nation, was first published in 1990. Fisk also reported on the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Algerian Civil War, the Bosnian War, the 2001 international intervention in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Arab Spring in 2011 and the ongoing Syrian Civil War. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to Iraqi heavy artillery in the Shatt-al-Arab when covering the early stages of the conflict.Robert Fisk, The Great War for Civilisation, 2005, p. 224. After the United States and allies launched their intervention in Afghanistan, Fisk was for a time transferred to Pakistan to provide coverage of the conflict. While reporting from there, he was attacked and beaten by a group of Afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the United States Air Force. He was ultimately rescued from this attack by another Afghan refugee. In his graphic account of his own beating, Fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their \\"brutality was entirely the product of others, of us‚Äîof we who had armed their struggle against the Russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the 'War for Civilisation' just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them 'collateral damage.'\\" During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Fisk was based in Baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports. He has criticised other journalists based in Iraq for what he calls their \\"hotel journalism\\", reporting from one's hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events. His opposition to the war brought criticism from both Irish Sunday Independent columnist and senator, Eoghan Harris,Harris, Eoghan. Air-kissing the terrorists ‚Äì call it Luvvies Actually, Sunday Independent (Dublin), 23 November 2003. and The Guardian columnist, Simon Hoggart.Hoggart, Simon. A war cry from the pulpit, The Guardian (London), 17 November 2001. Fisk has criticised the Coalition's handling of the sectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq, and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible: \\"The real question I ask myself is: who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war? Now the Americans will say it's Al Qaeda, it's the Sunni insurgents. It is the death squads. Many of the death squads work for the Ministry of Interior. Who runs the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad? Who pays the Ministry of the Interior? Who pays the militia men who make up the death squads? We do, the occupation authorities. (‚Ä¶) We need to look at this story in a different light.\\" =Osama bin Laden= Fisk interviewed Osama bin Laden on three occasions, reporting the interviews in articles published by The Independent on 6 December 1993, 10 July 1996, and 22 March 1997. In Fisk's first interview, \\"Anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace,\\" he wrote of Osama Bin Laden: \\"With his high cheekbones, narrow eyes and long brown robe, Mr Bin Laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend. Chadored children danced in front of him, preachers acknowledged his wisdom\\" while noting that he was accused of \\"training for further jihad wars\\".\\"Anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace\\", The Independent, 6 December 1993 https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anti-soviet-warrior-puts-his-army-on- the-road-to-peace-the-saudi-businessman-who-recruited-mujahedin-1465715.html During one of Fisk's interviews with Bin Laden, Fisk noted an attempt by Bin Laden to convert him. Bin Laden said; \\"Mr Robert, one of our brothers had a dream...that you were a spiritual person ... this means you are a true Muslim\\". Fisk replied; \\"Sheikh Osama, I am not a Muslim. ... I am a journalist [whose] task is to tell the truth\\". Bin Laden replied: \\"If you tell the truth, that means you are a good Muslim\\".Naparstek, Ben (30 August 2008). \\"Watching the warriors\\". New Zealand Listener, Vol 215 No 3564. During the 1996 interview, Bin Laden accused the Saudi royal family of corruption. During the final interview in 1997, Bin Laden said he sought God's help \\"to turn America into a shadow of itself\\".Fisk, Robert. \\"Robert Fisk on Bin Laden at 50\\". The Independent (London). 4 March 2007. Fisk strongly condemned the September 11 attacks, describing them as a \\"hideous crime against humanity\\". He also denounced the Bush administration's response to the attacks, arguing that \\"a score of nations\\" were being identified and positioned as \\"haters of democracy\\" or \\"kernels of evil\\", and urged a more honest debate on U.S. policy in the Middle East. He argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided \\"because, of course, to look too closely at the Middle East would raise disturbing questions about the region, about our Western policies in those tragic lands, and about America's relationship with Israel\\".Fisk, Robert (11 September 2002). \\"One year on: A view from the Middle East\\", The Independent (London). In 2007, Fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks. In an article for The Independent, he claimed that, while the Bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence, he is \\"increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of 9/11\\" and added that he does not condone the \\"crazed 'research' of David Icke\\", but is \\"talking about scientific issues\\". Fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at Sydney University in 2006.Bolt, Andrew (29 March 2006). \\"Are they all mad?\\" Herald Sun (Melbourne). During the speech, Fisk said: \\"Partly I think because of the culture of secrecy of the White House, never have we had a White House so secret as this one. Partly because of this culture, I think suspicions are growing in the United States, not just among Berkeley guys with flowers in their hair. (...) But there are a lot of things we don't know, a lot of things we're not going to be told. (...) Perhaps the [fourth] plane was hit by a missile, we still don't know\\".Fisk, Robert (26 March 2006). \\"Robert Fisk at Sydney Ideas 2006\\". ABC News Australia. Bill Durodie notes that \\"recently published compilation of Osama bin Laden‚Äôs writings reveals how frequently he is inclined to cite Western writers, Western diplomats and Western thinkers. At one point he even advises the White House to read Robert Fisk, rather than, as one might have supposed, the Koran.\\" =Syrian Civil War= From September 2012 onward, Fisk's reporting on the conflict in Syria has received a critical response with assertions he has sided with the Assad government. Sam Hamad, among others, has accused Fisk of being embedded with the Syrian army in Aleppo and Damascus and of \\"trumpet[ing]\\" Syrian and Russian government propaganda. Loubna Mrie said that Fisk claimed the Syrian government \\"did not use chemical weapons in various attacks on civilians\\". Reporting from Douma, Syria in April 2018 on the Douma chemical attack, he quoted a Syrian doctor (who he said used some terms in common with the Assad government) who attributed the victims' breathing problems not to gas but to dust and lack of oxygen after heavy shelling by Assad forces. Other people he spoke to doubted a gas attack, and Fisk queried such an incident. Richard Spencer and Catherine Philp in The Times reported that journalists had been taken to Douma on a government- organised trip while international investigators were forced to remain in Damascus. The Snopes website said other reporters on the same trip as Fisk had interviewed locals who made known their inhalation of toxic gas. Fisk returned to the subject of the Douma attacks in early January 2020 in an article concerning the apparent internal disagreements within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) recorded in documents released by WikiLeaks. Fisk was profiled in Yung Chang's 2019 documentary film This Is Not a Movie.Simon Houpt, \\"Journalism documentary This Is Not a Movie plays like Robert Fisk's greatest hits and misses: Yung Chang's new National Film Board doc looks at the career of the veteran British foreign correspondent\\".

He has said that journalism must \\"challenge authority, all authority, especially so when governments and politicians take us to war.\\" He has quoted with approval Israeli journalist Amira Hass: \\"There is a misconception that journalists can be objective ... What journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power.\\" He spoke on \\"Lies, Misreporting, and Catastrophe in the Middle East\\" at the First Congregational Church of Berkeley on 22 September 2010, and stated, \\"I think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer, whoever they may be.\\" He has written at length on how much contemporary conflicts have their origins, in his view, in lines drawn on maps: \\"After the allied victory of 1918, at the end of my father's war, the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies. In the space of just seventeen months, they created the borders of Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia and most of the Middle East. And I have spent my entire career‚Äîin Belfast and Sarajevo, in Beirut and Baghdad‚Äîwatching the people within those borders burn.\\"Robert Fisk, The Great War for Civilisation, 2005 Fisk has also written extensively about the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and has supported moves to persuade the Turkish Government to acknowledge the truth of what happened in it.See, for example, http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/10/14/confronting- turkey-s-armenian-genocide/, 14 October 2006.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and sketched down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. An individual comedy sketch is a brief scene or vignette of the type formerly used in vaudeville, and now used widely in comedy and variety shows, talk shows and some children's television series (such as Sesame Street).

Retrieved 5/4/2019 History Sketch comedy has its origins in vaudeville and music hall, where many brief, but humorous, acts were strung together to form a larger programme. In Britain, it moved to stage performances by Cambridge Footlights, such as Beyond the Fringe and A Clump of Plinths (which evolved into Cambridge Circus), to radio, with such shows as It's That Man Again and I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, then to television, with such shows as Not Only... But Also, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Not the Nine O'Clock News (and its successor Alas Smith and Jones), and A Bit of Fry and Laurie. In Mexico, the series Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada, created by Mexican comedian Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os under the stage name Chespirito, was broadcast between 1968 and 1973, creating such famous characters as El Chavo del Ocho and El Chapul√≠n Colorado. While separate sketches historically have tended to be unrelated, more recent groups have introduced overarching themes that connect the sketches within a particular show with recurring characters that return for more than one appearance. Examples of recurring characters include Mr. Gumby from Monty Python's Flying Circus; Ted and Ralph from The Fast Show; The Family from The Carol Burnett Show; the Head Crusher from The Kids in the Hall; Martin Short's Ed Grimley, a recurring character from both SCTV and Saturday Night Live; and Kevin and Perry from Harry Enfield and Chums. Recurring characters from Saturday Night Live have notably been featured in a number of spinoff films, including The Blues Brothers (1980), Wayne's World (1992) and Superstar (1999). The idea of running characters was taken a step further with shows like The Red Green Show and The League of Gentlemen, where sketches centered on the various inhabitants of the fictional towns of Possum Lake and Royston Vasey, respectively. In Little Britain, sketches focused on a cast of recurring characters. In North America, contemporary sketch comedy is largely an outgrowth of the improvisational comedy scene that flourished during the 1970s, largely growing out of The Second City in Chicago and Toronto, which was built upon the success in Minneapolis of The Brave New Workshop and Dudley Riggs. Notable contemporary American stage sketch comedy groups include The Second City, the Upright Citizens Brigade and The Groundlings. =Films= Such sketches made during the 1970s and 1980s were If You Don't Stop It... You'll Go Blind and the sequel Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?, The Groove Tube, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), The Kentucky Fried Movie and its sequel Amazon Women on the Moon, and Monty Python's And Now for Something Completely Different and The Meaning of Life. More recent sketch films include The Underground Comedy Movie, InAPPropriate Comedy and Movie 43. =Festivals= Many of the sketch comedy revues in Britain included seasons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Since 1999, the growing sketch comedy scene has precipitated the development of sketch comedy festivals in cities all around North America, including festivals in Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York City, Montreal, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver, and Philadelphia.

While scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation, however, are weak, especially for males. Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists. These factors, which may be related to the development of a sexual orientation, include genes, the early uterine environment (such as prenatal hormones), and brain structure. Scientific research and studies = Fetal development and hormones = The influence of hormones on the developing foetus has been the most influential causal hypothesis of the development of sexual orientation. In simple terms, the developing fetal brain begins in a \\"female\\" typical state. The presence of the Y-chromosome in males prompts the development of testes, which release testosterone, the primary androgen receptor-activating hormone, to masculinize the fetus and fetal brain. This masculinising effect pushes males towards male typical brain structures, and most of the time, attraction to females. It has been hypothesized that gay men may have been exposed to little testosterone in key regions of the brain, or had different levels of receptivity to its masculinizing effects, or experienced fluctuations at critical times. In women, it is hypothesized that high levels of exposure to testosterone in key regions may increase likelihood of same sex attraction. Supporting this are studies of the finger digit ratio of the right hand, which is a robust marker of prenatal testosterone exposure. Lesbians on average, have significantly more masculine digit ratios, a finding which has been replicated numerous times in studies cross-culturally. While direct effects are hard to measure for ethical reasons, animal experiments where scientists manipulate exposure to sex hormones during gestation can also induce life long male-typical behavior and mounting in female animals, and female-typical behavior in male animals. Maternal immune responses during fetal development are strongly demonstrated as causing male homosexuality and bisexuality. Research since the 1990's has demonstrated that the more male sons a woman has, there is a higher chance of later born sons being gay. During pregnancy, male cells enter a mother's bloodstream, which are foreign to her immune system. In response, she develops antibodies to neutralize them. These antibodies are then released on future male foetuses and may neutralize Y-linked antigens, which play a role in brain masculinization, leaving areas of the brain responsible for sexual attraction in the female-typical position, or attracted to men. The more sons a mother has will increase the levels of these antibodies, thus creating the observed fraternal birth order effect. Biochemical evidence to support this effect was confirmed in a lab study in 2017, finding that mothers with a gay son, particularly those with older brothers, had heightened levels of antibodies to the NLGN4Y Y-protein than mothers with heterosexual sons. J. Michael Bailey has described maternal immune responses as \\"causal\\" of male homosexuality. This effect is estimated to account for between 15-29% of gay men, while other gay and bisexual men are thought to owe sexual orientation to genetic and hormonal interactions. Socialization theories, which were dominant in the 1900's, favored the idea that children were born \\"undifferentiated\\" and were socialized into gender roles and sexual orientation. This led to medical experiments in which newborn and infant boys were surgically reassigned into girls after accidents such as botched circumcisions. These males were then reared and raised as females without telling the boys, which, contrary to expectations, did not make them feminine nor attracted to men. All published cases providing sexual orientation grew up to be strongly attracted to women. The failure of these experiments demonstrates that socialization effects does not induce feminine type behavior in males, nor make them attracted to men, and that the organizational effects of hormones on the fetal brain prior to birth have permanent effects. These are indicative of 'nature', not nurture, at least with regard to male sexual orientation. The sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) is a key region of the brain which differs between males and females in humans and a number of mammals (e.g., sheep/rams, mice, rats), and is caused by sex differences in hormone exposure. The INAH-3 region is bigger in males than in females, and is thought to be a critical region in sexual behavior. Dissection studies found that gay men had significantly smaller sized INAH-3 than heterosexual males, which is shifted in the female-typical direction, a finding first demonstrated by neuroscientist Simon LeVay, which has been replicated. Dissection studies are rare, however, due to lack of funding and brain samples. Long-term studies of domesticated sheep lead by Charles Roselli have found that 6-8% of rams have a homosexual preference throughout their life. Dissection of ram brains also found a similar smaller (feminized) structure in homosexually oriented rams compared to heterosexually oriented rams in the equivalent brain region to the human SDN, the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN). The size of the sheep oSDN has also been demonstrated to be formed in utero, rather than postnatally, underscoring the role of prenatal hormones in masculinization of the brain for sexual attraction. Other studies in humans have relied on brain imaging technology, such as research lead by Ivanka Savic which compared hemispheres of the brain. This research found that straight men had right hemispheres 2% larger than the left, described as modest but \\"highly significant difference\\" by neuroscientist Simon LeVay. In straight women, the two hemispheres were the same size. In gay men, the two hemispheres were also the same size, or sex atypical, while in lesbians, the right hemispheres were slightly larger than the left, indicating a small shift in the male direction. = Genetic influences = Multiple genes have been found to play a role in sexual orientation. Scientists caution that many people misconstrue the meanings of genetic and environmental. Environmental influence does not automatically imply that the social environment influences or contributes to the development of sexual orientation. Hypotheses for the impact of the post- natal social environment on sexual orientation are weak, especially for males. There is, however, a vast non-social environment that is non-genetic yet still biological, such as prenatal development, that likely helps shape sexual orientation. Twin studies Identical twins are more likely to have the same sexual orientation than non-identical twins. This indicates that genes have some influence on sexual orientation; however, scientists have found evidence that other events in the womb play a role. Twins may have separate amniotic sacs and placentas, resulting in different exposure and timing of hormones. A number of twin studies have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard conducted a study of male twins recruited from \\"homophile publications\\", and found that 52% of monozygotic (MZ) brothers (of whom 59 were questioned) and 22% of the dizygotic (DZ) twins were concordant for homosexuality. 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to an extent similar to that of non-twin siblings. In a study of 61 pairs of twins, researchers found among their mostly male subjects a concordance rate for homosexuality of 66% among monozygotic twins and a 30% one among dizygotic twins. In 2000, Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance. They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported zygosity, sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was serologically checked when in doubt. Other researchers support biological causes for both men and women's sexual orientation.Hershberger, Scott L. 2001. Biological Factors in the Development of Sexual Orientation. Pp. 27‚Äì51 in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identities and Youth: Psychological Perspectives, edited by Anthony R. D‚ÄôAugelli and Charlotte J. Patterson. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press. Quoted in Bearman and Bruckner, 2002. A 2008 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins) found that same-sex behaviour was explained by both heritable genetic factors and unique environmental factors (which can include the prenatal environment during gestation, exposure to illness in early life, peer groups not shared with a twin, etc.), although a twin study cannot identify which factor is at play. Influences of the shared environment (influences including the family environment, rearing, shared peer groups, culture and societal views, and sharing the same school and community) had no effect for men, and a weak effect for women. This is consistent with the common finding that parenting and culture appears to play no role in male sexual orientation, but may play some small role in women. The study concludes that genetic influences on any lifetime same-sex partner were stronger for men than women, and that \\"it has been suggested individual differences in heterosexual and homosexual behavior result from unique environmental factors such as prenatal exposure to sex hormones, progressive maternal immunization to sex-specific proteins, or neurodevelopmental factors\\", although does not rule out other variables. The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results: Chromosome linkage studies Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993, Dean Hamer and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families. Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of Xq28, which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the \\"gay gene\\" in the media, causing significant controversy. Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side. A later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X chromosome at Xq28. Two other studies (Bailey et al., 1999; McKnight and Malcolm, 2000) failed to find a preponderance of gay relatives in the maternal line of homosexual men. One study by Rice et al. in 1999 failed to replicate the Xq28 linkage results. Meta-analysis of all available linkage data indicates a significant link to Xq28, but also indicates that additional genes must be present to account for the full heritability of sexual orientation. Mustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al. (1995), as well as additional new subjects. In the full sample they did not find linkage to Xq28. Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. The data strongly replicated Hamer's Xq28 findings as determined by both two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study. The authors concluded that \\"our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation\\". Female sexual orientation does not seem to be linked to Xq28, though it does appear moderately heritable. In addition to sex chromosomal contribution, a potential autosomal genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that \\"unusually high\\" proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were Rh negative in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by alleles located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality. The biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems. In the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship. In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology bred a female mice specifically lacking a particular gene related to sexual behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice. In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality. In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named SLITRK6 on chromosome 13 was identified. The research supports another study which had been done by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. The SLITRK6 is active in the mid-brain where the hypothalamus is. The researchers found that the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) on chromosome 14 shows sequence differences between gay and straight men. Graves' disease is associated with TSHR abnormalities, with previous research indicating that Graves' disease is more common in gay men than in straight men. Research indicated that gay people have lower body weight than straight people. It had been suggested that the overactive TSHR hormone lowered body weight in gay people, though this remains unproven. In 2018, Ganna et al. performed another genome wide association study on sexual orientation of men and women with data from 26,890 people who had at least one same-sex partner and 450,939 controls. The data in the study was meta-analyzed and obtained from the UK Biobank study and 23andMe. The researchers identified four variants more common in people who reported at least one same-sex experience on chromosomes 7, 11, 12, and 15. The variants on chromosomes 11 and 15 were specific to men, with the variant on chromosome 11 located in an olfactory gene and the variant on chromosome 15 having previously been linked to male-pattern baldness. The four variants were also correlated with mood and mental health disorders; major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in men and women, and bipolar disorder in women. However, none of the four variants could reliably predict sexual orientation. In August 2019, a genome-wide association study of 493,001 individuals concluded that hundreds or thousands of genetic variants underlie homosexual behavior in both sexes, with 5 variants in particular being significantly associated. Some of these variants had sex-specific effects, and two of these variants suggested links to biological pathways that involve sex hormone regulation and olfaction. All the variants together captured between 8 and 25% of the variation in individual differences in homosexual behavior. These genes partly overlap with those for several other traits, including openness to experience and risk-taking behavior. Additional analyses suggested that sexual behavior, attraction, identity, and fantasies are influenced by a similar set of genetic variants. They also found that the genetic effects that differentiate heterosexual from homosexual behavior are not the same as those that differ among nonheterosexuals with lower versus higher proportions of same-sex partners, which suggests that there is no single continuum from heterosexual to homosexual preference, as suggested by the Kinsey scale.  =Epigenetics studies= A study suggests linkage between a mother's genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is \\"switched off\\". The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons. 13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons. =Birth order= Blanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%. This is now \\"one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation\\". To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus. This maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are \\"almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates\\". These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti- male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women. It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and 'remember'. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinization. In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think Neuroligin 4 Y-linked protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. In addition, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons. The results suggest an association between a maternal immune response to NLGN4Y and subsequent sexual orientation in male offspring. The fraternal birth order effect, however, does not apply to instances where a firstborn is homosexual.Cantor, Blanchard, Paterson, & Bogaert, 2002; Blanchard & Bogaert, 2004Blanchard, 2011; Rieger et al., 2012 =Female fertility= In 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother's side tended to have more offspring than those on the father's side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promotes fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that this is a highly significant but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation. =Pheromone studies= Research conducted in Sweden has suggested that gay and straight men respond differently to two odors that are believed to be involved in sexual arousal. The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men's sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen- like compound found in women's urine.Wade, Nicholas. (May 9, 2005). \\"Gay Men Are Found to Have Different Scent of Attraction.\\" New York Times. The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation. =Studies of brain structure= A number of sections of the brain have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, Dick Swaab and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the suprachiasmatic nucleus between homosexual and heterosexual men. In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the anterior commissure, but this research was refuted by numerous studies, one of which found that the entirety of the variation was caused by a single outlier. Research on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.Cahill, 2006; Lenroot and Giedd, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2009; Sakuma, 2009Berenbaum and Beltz, 2016. Sexually dimorphic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus LeVay also conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of neurons in the hypothalamus called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of sexual behaviour in animals, and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women. He obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness. The HIV-positive people in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either intravenous drug abusers or recipients of blood transfusions. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual \\"on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population\\". LeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men's brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women's brains. William Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1‚Äì4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV- positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance. Byne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation. LeVay has said that Byne replicated his work, but that he employed a two-tailed statistical analysis, which is typically reserved for when no previous findings had employed the difference. LeVay has said that \\"given that my study had already reported a INAH3 to be smaller in gay men, a one tailed approach would have been more appropriate, and it would have yielded a significant difference [between heterosexual and homosexual men]\\". J. Michael Bailey has criticized LeVay's critics ‚Äì describing the claim that the INAH-3 difference could be attributable to AIDS as \\"aggravating\\", since the \\"INAH-3 did not differ between the brains of straight men who died of AIDS and those who did not have the disease\\". Bailey has further criticized the second objection that was raised, that being gay might have somehow caused the difference in INAH-3, and not vice-versa, saying \\"the problem with this idea is that the hypothalamus appears to develop early. Not a single expert I have ever asked about LeVay‚Äôs study thought it was plausible that sexual behavior caused the INAH-3 differences.\\" The SCN of homosexual males has been demonstrated to be larger (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted D√∂rner hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female hypothalamus\\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \\"male brain from originally female brain\\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development. A 2010 study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab stated that \\"the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.\\" Ovine model The domestic ram is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male- oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females. Roselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show aromatase expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve aromatisation. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood. = Childhood gender nonconformity = Childhood gender nonconformity, or behaving like the other sex, is a strong predictor of adult sexual orientation that has been consistently replicated in research, and is thought to be strong evidence of a biological difference between heterosexual and non-heterosexuals. A review authored by J. Michael Bailey states: \\"childhood gender nonconformity comprises the following phenomena among boys: cross-dressing, desiring to have long hair, playing with dolls, disliking competitive sports and rough play, preferring girls as playmates, exhibiting elevated separation anxiety, and desiring to be‚Äîor believing that one is‚Äîa girl. In girls, gender nonconformity comprises dressing like and playing with boys, showing interest in competitive sports and rough play, lacking interest in conventionally female toys such as dolls and makeup, and desiring to be a boy\\". This gender nonconformist behavior typically emerges at preschool age, although is often evident as early as age 2. Children are only considered gender nonconforming if they persistently engage in a variety of these behaviors, as opposed to engaging in a behavior on a few times or on occasion. It is also not a one-dimensional trait, but rather has varying degrees. Children who grow up to be non-heterosexual were, on average, substantially more gender nonconforming in childhood. This is confirmed in both retrospective studies where homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals are asked about their gender typical behavior in childhood, and in prospective studies, where highly gender nonconforming children are followed from childhood into adulthood to find out their sexual orientation. A review of retrospective studies that measured gender nonconforming traits estimated that 89% of homosexual men exceeded heteroseuxal males level of gender nonconformity, whereas just 2% of heterosexual men exceeded the homosexual median. For female sexual orientation, the figures were 81% and 12% respectively. A variety of other assessments such as childhood home videos, photos and reports of parents also confirm this finding. Critics of this research see this as confirming stereotypes; however, no study has ever demonstrated that this research has exaggerated childhood gender nonconformity. J. Michael Bailey argues that gay men often deny that they were gender nonconforming in childhood because they may have been bullied or maltreated by peers and parents for it, and because they often do not find femininity attractive in other gay males and thus would not want to acknowledge it in themselves. Additional research in Western cultures and non- Western cultures including Latin America, Asia, Polynesia, and the Middle East supports the validity of childhood gender nonconformity as a predictor of adult non-heterosexuality. This research does not mean that all non- heterosexuals were gender nonconforming, but rather indicates that long before sexual attraction is known, non-heterosexuals, on average, are noticeably different from other children. There is little evidence that gender nonconforming children have been encouraged or taught to behave that way; rather, childhood gender nonconformity typically emerges despite conventional socialization. Medical experiments in which infant boys were sex reassigned and reared as girls did not make them feminine nor attracted to males. = Boys who were surgically reassigned female = Between the 1960s and 2000, many newborn and infant boys were surgically reassigned as females if they were born with malformed penises, or if they lost their penises in accidents. Many surgeons believed such males would be happier being socially and surgically reassigned female. In all seven published cases that have provided sexual orientation information, the subjects grew up to be attracted to females. Six cases were exclusively attracted to females, with one case 'predominantly' attracted to females. In a review article in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest, six researchers including J. Michael Bailey state this establishes a strong case that male sexual orientation is partly established before birth: They further argue that this raises questions about the significance of the social environment on sexual orientation, stating, \\"If one cannot reliably make a male human become attracted to other males by cutting off his penis in infancy and rearing him as a girl, then what other psychosocial intervention could plausibly have that effect?\\" It is further stated that neither cloacal exstrophy (resulting in a malformed penis), nor surgical accidents, are associated with abnormalities of prenatal androgens, thus, the brains of these individuals were male-organized at birth. Six of the seven identified as heterosexual males at follow up, despite being surgically altered and reared as females, with researchers adding: \\"available evidence indicates that in such instances, parents are deeply committed to raising these children as girls and in as gender-typical a manner as possible.\\" Bailey et al. describe these sex reassignments as 'the near-perfect quasi-experiment' in measuring the impact of 'nature' versus 'nurture' with regards to male homosexuality. ='Exotic becomes erotic' theory= Daryl Bem, a social psychologist at Cornell University, has theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood. A child's temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender. Others will prefer activities that are typical of another gender. This will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. According to Bem, this feeling of difference will evoke psychological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which it considers as being 'different'. Bem theorizes that this psychological arousal will later be transformed into sexual arousal: children will become sexually attracted to the gender which they see as different (\\"exotic\\"). This proposal is known as the \\"exotic becomes erotic\\" theory. PDF Wetherell et al. state that Bem \\"does not intend his model as an absolute prescription for all individuals, but rather as a modal or average explanation.\\" Two critiques of Bem's theory in the journal Psychological Review concluded that \\"studies cited by Bem and additional research show that [the] Exotic Becomes Erotic theory is not supported by scientific evidence.\\" Bem was criticized for relying on a non-random sample of gay men from the 1970s (rather than collecting new data) and for drawing conclusions that appear to contradict the original data. An \\"examination of the original data showed virtually all respondents were familiar with children of both sexes\\", and that only 9% of gay men said that \\"none or only a few\\" of their friends were male, and most gay men (74%) reported having \\"an especially close friend of the same sex\\" during grade school. Further, \\"71% of gay men reported feeling different from other boys, but so did 38% of heterosexual men. The difference for gay men is larger, but still indicates that feeling different from same-sex peers was common for heterosexual men.\\" Bem also acknowledged that gay men were more likely to have older brothers (the fraternal birth order effect), which appeared to contradict an unfamiliarity with males. Bem cited cross-cultural studies which also \\"appear to contradict the EBE theory assertion\\", such as the Sambia tribe in Papua New Guinea, which ritually enforced homosexual acts among teenagers; yet once these boys reached adulthood, only a small proportion of men continued to engage in homosexual behaviour - similar to levels observed in the United States. Additionally, Bem's model could be interpreted as implying that if one could change a child's behavior, one could change their sexual orientation, but most psychologists doubt this would be possible. Neuroscientist Simon LeVay said that while Bem's theory was arranged in a \\"believable temporal order\\", that it ultimately \\"lacks empirical support\\". Social psychologist Justin Lehmiller stated that Bem's theory has received praise \\"for the way it seamlessly links biological and environmental influences\\" and that there \\"is also some support for the model in the sense that childhood gender nonconformity is indeed one of the strongest predicators of adult homosexuality\\", but that the validity of the model \\"has been questioned on numerous grounds and scientists have largely rejected it.\\" Sexual orientation and evolution =General= Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be maladaptive in an evolutionary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection‚Äîon the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency. Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility. Some scholars have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children, a hypothesised instance of kin selection. By way of analogy, the allele (a particular version of a gene) which causes sickle- cell anemia when two copies are present, also confers resistance to malaria with a lesser form of anemia when one copy is present (this is called heterozygous advantage).Baker, Robin (1996) Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex, p.241 ff. Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality. In a 2008 study, its authors stated that \\"There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency.\\" They hypothesized that \\"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\\". Their results suggested that \\"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\\". However, in the same study, the authors noted that \\"nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out\\" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing \\"social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way\\" (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. The study acknowledges that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an \\"absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past\\". The heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased fecundity in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men. As originally pointed out by Hamer,Hamer, D., Copeland, P. The Science of Desire: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior (Simon and Schuster, 1994) even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a \\"gay gene\\" could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population. =Gay uncle hypothesis= The \\"gay uncle hypothesis\\" posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives. This hypothesis is an extension of the theory of kin selection, which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by J. B. S. Haldane in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including John Maynard Smith, W. D. Hamilton and Mary Jane West-Eberhard.Mayr, E. (1982). The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p 598. This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non- reproductive. Vasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the fa'afafine, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the fa'afafine said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who aren't family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis. The hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins. Vasey and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype. Biological differences in gay men and lesbian women =Anatomical= Some studies have found correlations between physiology of people and their sexuality; these studies provide evidence which suggests that: * Gay men and straight women have, on average, equally proportioned brain hemispheres. Lesbian women and straight men have, on average, slightly larger right brain hemispheres. * The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus was found by Swaab and Hopffman to be larger in gay men than in non-gay men,http://www.dafml.unito.it/anatomy/panzica/pubblicazioni/pdf/1995PanzicaJEI.pdf the suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women. * Gay men report, on average, slightly longer and thicker penises than non-gay men. * The average size of the INAH 3 in the brains of gay men is approximately the same size as INAH 3 in women, which is significantly smaller, and the cells more densely packed, than in heterosexual men's brains. * The anterior commissure is larger in women than men and was reported to be larger in gay men than in non-gay men, but a subsequent study found no such difference. * The functioning of the inner ear and the central auditory system in lesbians and bisexual women are more like the functional properties found in men than in non-gay women (the researchers argued this finding was consistent with the prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation). * The startle response (eyeblink following a loud sound) is similarly masculinized in lesbians and bisexual women. * Gay and non-gay people's brains respond differently to two putative sex pheromones (AND, found in male armpit secretions, and EST, found in female urine). * The amygdala, a region of the brain, is more active in gay men than non-gay men when exposed to sexually arousing material.. The authors of the study caution that any interpretation of this finding must take into account that the group difference in brain activation between heterosexual men and homosexual men in the amygdala region is not large and that the most robust finding is that both heterosexual and homosexual men used the same areas when they reacted to sexually preferred stimuli. \\"For the most part, homosexual and heterosexual men showed very similar patterns of activation (albeit to different erotic stimuli). One possible exception was the amygdala, in which homosexual men showed greater activational differences between preferred and nonpreferred erotic stimuli compared with heterosexual men. However, this difference was not hypothesized a priori, was not large, and was the only group difference found out of many tested. Thus, this finding needs replication.\\"(Debra A. Hope (editor), What is Sexual Orientation and Do Women Have One? (presentation by J.M. Bailey), Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, Volume 54 p. 47, Springer Science, 2009.) * Finger length ratios between the index and ring fingers have been reported to differ, on average, between non-gay and lesbian women. * Gay men and lesbians are significantly more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous than non-gay men and women; Simon LeVay argues that because \\"[h]and preference is observable before birth... [t]he observation of increased non-right-handness in gay people is therefore consistent with the idea that sexual orientation is influenced by prenatal processes,\\" perhaps heredity. * A study of over 50 gay men found that about 23% had counterclockwise hair whorl, as opposed to 8% in the general population. This may correlate with left-handedness.The Science of Gaydar by David France. New York Magazine. 18 June 2007. * Gay men have increased ridge density in the fingerprints on their left thumbs and little fingers. * Length of limbs and hands of gay men is smaller compared to height than the general population, but only among white men. J. Michael Bailey has argued that the early childhood gender nonconforming behavior of homosexuals, as opposed to biological markers, are better evidence of homosexuality being an inborn trait. He argues that gay men are \\"punished much more than rewarded\\" for their childhood gender nonconformity, and that such behavior \\"emerges with no encouragement, and despite opposition\\", making it \\"the sine qua non of innateness\\". Political aspects Whether genetic or other physiological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. The Advocate, a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that \\"it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined\\".The Advocate (1996, February 6). Advocate Poll Results. p. 8. A cross-national study in the United States, the Philippines, and Sweden found that those who believed that \\"homosexuals are born that way\\" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that \\"homosexuals choose to be that way\\" or \\"learn to be that way\\". Equal protection analysis in U.S. law determines when government requirements create a ‚Äúsuspect classification\\" of groups and therefore eligible for heightened scrutiny based on several factors, one of which is immutability. Evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis.Balog, Kari (2005‚Äì2006) \\"Equal Protection for Homosexuals: Why the Immutability Argument is Necessary and How it is Met.\\", Cleveland St. L. Rev. 545‚Äì573.\\"Is Sexuality Immutable?\\", Margaret Talbot, The New Yorker, January 25, 2010. The perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C., argues in the book Getting It Straight that finding people are born gay \\"would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against 'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true.\\" On the other hand, some social conservatives such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality.What Makes People Gay? By Neil Swidey. The Boston Globe. Published August 14, 2005. Accessed June 18, 2009. National Organization for Marriage board member and fiction writer Orson Scott Card has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that \\"our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized.... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community... There is no 'cure' for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires.\\" Some advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist what they perceive as attempts to pathologise or medicalise 'deviant' sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm. The journalist Chandler Burr has stated that \\"[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric \\"treatments\\" for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical \\"rewiring\\" of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb.\\"Homosexuality and Biology. By Chandler Burr. The Atlantic Monthly. June 2007. LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research \\"has contributed to the status of gay people in society\\".

They launched the first piloted ascent, carrying Jacques-√âtienne. Joseph-Michel also invented the self-acting hydraulic ram (1796), Jacques-√âtienne founded the first paper-making vocational school and the brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper. Early years The Montgolfier brothers Joseph-Michel (born 26 August 1740) and Jacques-√âtienne (born 6 January 1745) were born into a family of paper manufacturers founded in 1534 in Annonay, in Ard√®che, France. Their parents were Pierre Montgolfier (1700‚Äì1793) and his wife, Anne Duret (1701‚Äì1760), who had 16 children. Pierre Montgolfier established his eldest son, Raymond (1730‚Äì1772), as his successor. Joseph-Michel was the 12th child and was described as a maverick and dreamer (\\"a typical inventor's temperament\\") and was impractical in terms of business and personal affairs. √âtienne was the 15th child, had a much more even and businesslike temperament and was sent to Paris to train as an architect. After the sudden and unexpected death of Raymond in 1772, he was recalled to Annonay to run the family business. In the subsequent 10 years, √âtienne applied his talent for technical innovation to the family business of paper making, which then as now was a high-tech industry. He succeeded in incorporating the latest Dutch innovations of the day into the family mills. Hot air balloon experiments, 1782-84 =Hot air balloon experiments, 1782= Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who was first interested in aeronautics; as early as 1775 he built parachutes, and once jumped from the family house. He first contemplated building machines when he observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards.C.C. Gillispie, The Montgolfier brothers and the invention of aviation 1783-1784, p. 15. Joseph made his first definitive experiments in November 1782 while living in Avignon. He reported some years later that he was watching a fire one evening while contemplating one of the great military issues of the day‚Äîan assault on the fortress of Gibraltar, which had proved impregnable from both sea and land.C.C. Gillispie, p. 16. Joseph mused on the possibility of an air assault using troops lifted by the same force that was lifting the embers from the fire. He believed that the smoke itself was the buoyant part and contained within it a special gas, which he called \\"Montgolfier Gas\\", with a special property he called levity, which is why he preferred smoldering fuel. Joseph then built a box-like chamber 1√ó1√ó1.3 m (3 ft by by 4 ft) out of very thin wood, and covered the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth. He crumpled and lit some paper under the bottom of the box. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling. Joseph recruited his brother to balloon building by writing, \\"Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing sights in the world.\\" The two brothers built a similar device, scaled up by three (so 27 times greater in volume). On 14 December 1782 they did their very first test flight, lighting with wool and hay, and the lifting force was so great, that they lost control of their craft. The device floated nearly two kilometers (about 1.2 mi) and was destroyed after landing by the \\"indiscretion\\" of passersby.C.C. Gillispie, p. 21. =Public demonstrations, summer 1783= First public demonstration in Annonay, 4 June 1783 First Montgolfier brothers balloon, 1783 To make a public demonstration and to claim its invention the brothers constructed a globe- shaped balloon of sackcloth tightened with three thin layers of paper inside. The envelope could contain nearly 790 m¬≥ (28,000 cubic feet) of air and weighed 225 kg (500 lb). It was constructed of four pieces (the dome and three lateral bands) and held together by 1,800 buttons. A reinforcing fish net of cord covered the outside of the envelope. On 4 June 1783, they flew the balloon at Annonay in front of a group of dignitaries from the √âtats ‚Ä≥particuliers‚Ä≥‚Ä≥. The flight covered 2 km (1.2 mi), lasted 10 minutes, and had an estimated altitude of 1,600-2,000 m (5,200-6,600 ft). Word of their success quickly reached Paris. √âtienne went to the capital to make further demonstrations and to solidify the brothers' claim to the invention of flight. Joseph, given his unkempt appearance and shyness, remained with the family. √âtienne was the epitome of sober virtues ... modest in clothes and manner...S. Schama (1989) Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution, p. 125. In collaboration with the wallpaper manufacturer Jean-Baptiste R√©veillon, √âtienne constructed a envelope of taffeta coated with a varnish of alum for fireproofing. The balloon was sky blue and decorated with golden flourishes, signs of the zodiac, and suns. The design showed the intervention of R√©veillon. The next test was on 11 September from the grounds of la Folie Titon, close to R√©veillon's house. There was some concern about the effects of flight into the upper atmosphere on living creatures. The king proposed to launch two convicted criminals, but it is most likely that the inventors decided to send a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft first. On 19 September 1783, the A√©rostat R√©veillon was flown with the first living beings in a basket attached to the balloon: a sheep called Montauciel (\\"Climb-to-the- sky\\"), a duck and a rooster. The sheep was believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck was expected to be unharmed by being lifted and was included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the altitude. The rooster was included as a further control as it was a bird that did not fly at high altitudes. The demonstration was performed at the royal palace in Versailles, before King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette and a crowd.C.C. Gillispie, pp. 92‚Äì3. The flight lasted approximately eight minutes, covered two miles (3 km), and obtained an altitude of about . The craft landed safely after flying. =Piloted flight, autumn 1783= A 1786 depiction of the Montgolfier brothers' historic balloon with engineering data. Translated details are available on the image hosting page. Since the animals survived, the king allowed flights with humans. Again in collaboration with R√©veillon, √âtienne built a balloon for the purpose of making flights with humans. It was about 23 m (75 feet) tall and about 15 m (50 feet) in diameter. R√©veillon supplied rich decorative touches of gold figures on a deep blue background, including fleur-de-lis, signs of the zodiac, and suns with Louis XVI's face in the center interlaced with the royal monogram in the central section. Red and blue drapery and golden eagles were at the base of the balloon. √âtienne Montgolfier was the first human to lift off the Earth, making a tethered test flight from the yard of the R√©veillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, most likely on 15 October 1783. A little while later on that same day, physicist Pil√¢tre de Rozier became the second to ascend into the air, to an altitude of , which was the length of the tether. Proposed Monument to Commemorate the Invention of the Balloon by Claude Michel, ca, 1784. On 21 November 1783, the first free flight by humans was made by Pil√¢tre de Rozier, together with an army officer, the marquis d'Arlandes. The flight began from the grounds of the Ch√¢teau de la Muette close to the Bois de Boulogne park in the western outskirts of Paris. They flew about above Paris for a distance of nine kilometers. After 25 minutes, the balloon landed between the windmills, outside the city ramparts, on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be daubed out with sponges. As it appeared it could destroy the balloon, Pil√¢tre took off his coat to stop the fire. The early flights made a sensation. Numerous engravings commemorated the events. Chairs were designed with balloon backs, and mantel clocks were produced in enamel and gilt-bronze replicas set with a dial in the balloon. One could buy crockery decorated with naive pictures of balloons. In December 1783, father Pierre Montgolfier was elevated to the nobility and the hereditary appellation of de Montgolfier by King Louis XVI of France.

However, this claim is not generally recognized by aviation historians outside the Portuguese-speaking community, in particular the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale. On 1 December 1783, a few months after the Montgolfiers' first flight, Jacques Alexandre C√©sar Charles rose to an altitude of about near Paris in a hydrogen filled balloon he had developed. In early 1784, the Flesselles balloon, named after the unfortunate Jacques de Flesselles, later to be an early casualty at the Bastille, gave a rough landing to its passengers. In June 1784, the Gustave (a hot air balloon christened La Gustave in honour of King Gustav III of Sweden's visit to Lyon ) saw the first (singing) female aeronaut, √âlisabeth Thible. Other Montgolfier inventions Both brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper looking like vellum, reproducing the technique of the English, followed by the papermakers Johannot and R√©veillon.Our History 1777 Canson, n.d., 2 July 2017 In 1796, Joseph Michel Montgolfier invented the first self-acting hydraulic ram, a water pump to raise water for his paper mill at Voiron. In 1772, the British clockmaker John Whitehurst had invented its precursor, the \\"pulsation engine\\". In 1797, Montgolfier's friend Matthew Boulton took out a British patent on his behalf. In 1816, Joseph Michel's sons obtained a British patent for an improved version of the pump.See, for example: \\"New Patents: Pierre Fran√ßois Montgolfier\\" The Annals of Philosophy, 7 (41) : 405 (May 1816). Death, the Montgolfier company Both brothers were freemasons in Les Neuf Soeurs lodge in Paris.Dictionnaire de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie (Daniel Ligou, Presses Universitaires de France, 2006) In 1799, Etienne de Montgolfier died on the way from Lyon to Annonay. His son-in-law, Barth√©l√©my Barou de la Lombardi√®re de Canson (1774‚Äì1859), succeeded him as the head of the company, thanks to his marriage with Alexandrine de Montgolfier. The company became \\"Montgolfier et Canson\\" in 1801, then \\"Canson-Montgolfier\\" in 1807. In 1810, Joseph-Michel died in Balaruc-les-Bains. The Montgolfier Company in Annonay still exists under the name Canson. It produces fine art papers, school drawing papers and digital fine art and photography papers sold in 150 countries.Our Values Canson, n.d., 2 July 2017 In 1983, the Montgolfier brothers were inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

He \\"made a number of original and insightful innovations\\"Dictionary of National Biography in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs (specifically the Rosetta Stone) before Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion eventually expanded on his work. Young has been described as \\"The Last Man Who Knew Everything\\". His work informed that later done by William Herschel, Hermann von Helmholtz, James Clerk Maxwell, and Albert Einstein. Young is credited with establishing the wave theory of light, in contrast to the particle theory of Isaac Newton. Young's work was subsequently supported by the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Biography Young belonged to a Quaker family of Milverton, Somerset, where he was born in 1773, the eldest of ten children. At the age of fourteen Young had learned Greek and Latin. Young began to study medicine in London at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1792, moved to the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1794, and a year later went to G√∂ttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany, where he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine in 1796 from the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1797 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the same year he inherited the estate of his grand-uncle, Richard Brocklesby, which made him financially independent, and in 1799 he established himself as a physician at 48 Welbeck Street, London (now recorded with a blue plaque). Young published many of his first academic articles anonymously to protect his reputation as a physician. In 1801, Young was appointed professor of natural philosophy (mainly physics) at the Royal Institution. In two years, he delivered 91 lectures. In 1802, he was appointed foreign secretary of the Royal Society, of which he had been elected a fellow in 1794. He resigned his professorship in 1803, fearing that its duties would interfere with his medical practice. His lectures were published in 1807 in the Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and contain a number of anticipations of later theories. In 1811, Young became physician to St George's Hospital, and in 1814 he served on a committee appointed to consider the dangers involved in the general introduction of gas for lighting into London. In 1816 he was secretary of a commission charged with ascertaining the precise length of the second's or seconds pendulum (the length of a pendulum whose period is exactly 2 seconds), and in 1818 he became secretary to the Board of Longitude and superintendent of the HM Nautical Almanac Office. Young was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822. A few years before his death he became interested in life insurance, and in 1827 he was chosen one of the eight foreign associates of the French Academy of Sciences. In the same year he became a first class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1804, Young married Eliza Maxwell. They had no children. Death, legacy and reputation Thomas Young died in his 56th year in London on 10 May 1829, having suffered recurrent attacks of \\"asthma\\". His autopsy revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Giles Church at Farnborough, in the county of Kent. Westminster Abbey houses a white marble tablet in memory of Young,'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p58: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 bearing an epitaph by Hudson Gurney: Young was highly regarded by his friends and colleagues. He was said never to impose his knowledge, but if asked was able to answer even the most difficult scientific question with ease. Although very learned he had a reputation for sometimes having difficulty in communicating his knowledge. It was said by one of his contemporaries that, \\"His words were not those in familiar use, and the arrangement of his ideas seldom the same as those he conversed with. He was therefore worse calculated than any man I ever knew for the communication of knowledge.\\"\\"Peacock's Life of Dr Young\\" by George Peacock, D.D., F.R.S., etc. Dean of Ely, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy University of Cambridge, etc. quoted in \\"The Living Age\\" by E. Littell, Second Series, Volume X, 1855, Littell, Son and Company, Boston. Later scholars and scientists have praised Young's work although they may know him only through achievements he made in their fields. His contemporary Sir John Herschel called him a \\"truly original genius\\". Albert Einstein praised him in the 1931 foreword to an edition of Isaac Newton's Opticks. Other admirers include physicist Lord Rayleigh and Nobel laureate Philip Anderson. Thomas Young's name has been adopted as the name of the London-based Thomas Young Centre, an alliance of academic research groups engaged in the theory and simulation of materials. Young Sound in Greenland was named in his honour by William Scoresby (1789‚Äì1857).Place names, NE Greenland Research =Wave theory of light= In Young's own judgment, of his many achievements the most important was to establish the wave theory of light. To do so, he had to overcome the century-old view, expressed in the venerable Newton's Opticks, that light is a particle. Nevertheless, in the early 19th century Young put forth a number of theoretical reasons supporting the wave theory of light, and he developed two enduring demonstrations to support this viewpoint. With the ripple tank he demonstrated the idea of interference in the context of water waves. With Young's interference experiment, or double-slit experiment, he demonstrated interference in the context of light as a wave. Plate from \\"Lectures\\" of 1802 (RI), pub. 1807 Young, speaking on 24 November 1803, to the Royal Society of London, began his now-classic description of the historic experiment: In his subsequent paper, titled Experiments and Calculations Relative to Physical Optics (1804), Young describes an experiment in which he placed a card measuring approximately in a beam of light from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of colour in the shadow and to the sides of the card. He observed that placing another card in front or behind the narrow strip so as to prevent the light beam from striking one of its edges caused the fringes to disappear. p. 309 This supported the contention that light is composed of waves.Both Young and Newton were eventually shown to be partially correct, as neither wave nor particle explanations alone can explain the behaviour of light. See e.g. http://www.single-molecule.nl/notes/light-waves-and-photons/. Young performed and analysed a number of experiments, including interference of light from reflection off nearby pairs of micrometre grooves, from reflection off thin films of soap and oil, and from Newton's rings. He also performed two important diffraction experiments using fibres and long narrow strips. In his Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts (1807) he gives Grimaldi credit for first observing the fringes in the shadow of an object placed in a beam of light. Within ten years, much of Young's work was reproduced and then extended by Augustin-Jean Fresnel. =Young's modulus= Young's Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy Young described the characterization of elasticity that came to be known as Young's modulus, denoted as E, in 1807, and further described it in his Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts. However, the first use of the concept of Young's modulus in experiments was by Giordano Riccati in 1782‚Äîpredating Young by 25 years. Furthermore, the idea can be traced to a paper by Leonhard Euler published in 1727, some 80 years before Thomas Young's 1807 paper. The Young's modulus relates the stress (pressure) in a body to its associated strain (change in length as a ratio of the original length); that is, stress = E √ó strain, for a uniaxially loaded specimen. Young's modulus is independent of the component under investigation; that is, it is an inherent material property (the term modulus refers to an inherent material property). Young's Modulus allowed, for the first time, prediction of the strain in a component subject to a known stress (and vice versa). Prior to Young's contribution, engineers were required to apply Hooke's F = kx relationship to identify the deformation (x) of a body subject to a known load (F), where the constant (k) is a function of both the geometry and material under consideration. Finding k required physical testing for any new component, as the F = kx relationship is a function of both geometry and material. Young's Modulus depends only on the material, not its geometry, thus allowing a revolution in engineering strategies. Young's problems in sometimes not expressing himself clearly were shown by his own definition of the modulus: \\"The modulus of the elasticity of any substance is a column of the same substance, capable of producing a pressure on its base which is to the weight causing a certain degree of compression as the length of the substance is to the diminution of its length.\\" When this explanation was put to the Lords of the Admiralty, their clerk wrote to Young saying \\"Though science is much respected by their Lordships and your paper is much esteemed, it is too learned ... in short it is not understood.\\"\\"Structures, or Why Things Don't Fall Down\\" by J. E. Gordon, Penguin Books, 1978. =Vision and colour theory= Young has also been called the founder of physiological optics. In 1793 he explained the mode in which the eye accommodates itself to vision at different distances as depending on change of the curvature of the crystalline lens; in 1801 he was the first to describe astigmatism; and in his lectures he presented the hypothesis, afterwards developed by Hermann von Helmholtz, (the Young‚ÄìHelmholtz theory), that colour perception depends on the presence in the retina of three kinds of nerve fibres. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of colour vision, in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three colour receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges. =Young‚ÄìLaplace equation= In 1804, Young developed the theory of capillary phenomena on the principle of surface tension. He also observed the constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid, and showed how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action. In 1805, Pierre-Simon Laplace, the French philosopher, discovered the significance of meniscus radii with respect to capillary action. In 1830, Carl Friedrich Gauss, the German mathematician, unified the work of these two scientists to derive the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation, the formula that describes the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids. Young was the first to define the term \\"energy\\" in the modern sense. =Young's equation and Young‚ÄìDupr√© equation= Young's equation describes the contact angle of a liquid drop on a plane solid surface as a function of the surface free energy, the interfacial free energy and the surface tension of the liquid. Young's equation was developed further some 60 years later by Dupr√© to account for thermodynamic effects, and this is known as the Young‚ÄìDupr√© equation. =Medicine= In physiology Young made an important contribution to haemodynamics in the Croonian lecture for 1808 on the \\"Functions of the Heart and Arteries,\\" where he derived a formula for the wave speed of the pulse and his medical writings included An Introduction to Medical Literature, including a System of Practical Nosology (1813) and A Practical and Historical Treatise on Consumptive Diseases (1815). Young devised a rule of thumb for determining a child's drug dosage. Young's Rule states that the child dosage is equal to the adult dosage multiplied by the child's age in years, divided by the sum of 12 plus the child's age. =Languages= In an appendix to his 1796 G√∂ttingen dissertation De corporis hvmani viribvs conservatricibvs there are four pages added proposing a universal phonetic alphabet (so as 'not to leave these pages blank'; lit.: \\"Ne vacuae starent hae paginae, libuit e praelectione ante disputationem habenda tabellam literarum vniuersalem raptim describere\\"). It includes 16 \\"pure\\" vowel symbols, nasal vowels, various consonants, and examples of these, drawn primarily from French and English. In his Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article \\"Languages\\", Young compared the grammar and vocabulary of 400 languages. In a separate work in 1813, he introduced the term Indo-European languages, 165 years after the Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn proposed the grouping to which this term refers in 1647. =Egyptian hieroglyphs= Young made significant contributions to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. He started his Egyptology work rather late, in 1813, when the work was already in progress among other researchers. He began by using an Egyptian demotic alphabet of 29 letters built up by Johan David √Ökerblad in 1802 (14 turned out to be incorrect). √Ökerblad was correct in stressing the importance of the demotic text in trying to read the inscriptions, but he wrongly believed that demotic was entirely alphabetic.E.A.W. Budge, [1893], The Rosetta Stone. www.sacred-texts.com p132 By 1814 Young had completely translated the \\"enchorial\\" text of the Rosetta Stone (using a list with 86 demotic words), and then studied the hieroglyphic alphabet but initially failed to recognise that the demotic and hieroglyphic texts were paraphrases and not simple translations.Young's first publications are as follows: \\"Letter to the Rev. S. Weston respecting some Egyptian Antiquities\\". With four copper plates [published under the name of his friend William Rouse Boughton, but written by Young], Archeologia Britannica. London, 1814. Vol. XVIII. P. 59-72; [Anonymous publication], Museum Criticum of Cambridge, Pt. VI., 1815 (this includes the correspondence which took place between Young, Silvestre de Sacy and Akerblad) There was considerable rivalry between Young and Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion while both were working on hieroglyphic decipherment. At first they briefly cooperated in their work, but later, from around 1815, a chill arose between them. For many years they kept details of their work away from each other. Some of Young's conclusions appeared in the famous article \\"Egypt\\" he wrote for the 1818 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. When Champollion finally published a translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the grammatical system in 1822, Young (and many others) praised his work. Nevertheless, a year later Young published an Account of the Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphic Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, to have his own work recognised as the basis for Champollion's system. Young had correctly found the sound value of six hieroglyphic signs, but had not deduced the grammar of the language. Young himself acknowledged that he was somewhat at a disadvantage because Champollion's knowledge of the relevant languages, such as Coptic, was much greater. Several scholars have suggested that Young's true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the demotic script. He made the first major advances in this area; he also correctly identified demotic as being composed by both ideographic and phonetic signs. Subsequently, Young felt that Champollion was unwilling to share the credit for the decipherment. In the ensuing controversy, strongly motivated by the political tensions of that time, the British tended to champion Young, while the French mostly championed Champollion. Champollion did acknowledge some of Young's contribution, but rather sparingly. However, after 1826, when Champollion was a curator in the Louvre, he did offer Young access to demotic manuscripts. In England, while Sir George Lewis still doubted Champollion's achievement as late as 1862, others were more accepting. For example, Reginald Poole, and Sir Peter Le Page Renouf both defended Champollion. =Music= He developed Young temperament, a method of tuning musical instruments. = Religious views = Though he sometimes dealt with religious topics of history in Egypt and wrote about the history of Christianity in Nubia, not much is known about Young's personal religious views.Wood, Alexander. 2011. Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773‚Äì1829. Cambridge University Press. p. 56 On George Peacock's account, Young never spoke to him about morals, metaphysics or religion, though according to Young's wife, his attitudes showed that \\"his Quaker upbringing had strongly influenced his religious practices.\\"Wood, Alexander. 2011. Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773‚Äì1829. Cambridge University Press. p. 329 Authority sources have described Young in terms of a cultural Christian Quaker.Peacock & Leitch., Miscellaneous works of the late Thomas Young (1855), London, J. Murray, p. 516: \\"he was pre-eminently entitled to the high distinction of a Christian, patriot, and philosopher.\\"Wood, Alexander. 2011. Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773‚Äì1829. Cambridge University Press. p. XVI Hudson Gurney informed that before his marriage, Young had to join the Church of England, and was baptized later. After his work on physics received some criticism from Henry Brougham, Young stated: \\"I have resolved to confine my studies and my pen to medical subjects only. For the talents which God has not given me, I am not responsible, but those which I possess, I have hitherto cultivated and employed as diligently as my opportunities have allowed me to do ; and I shall continue to apply them with assiduity, and in tranquillity, to that profession which has constantly been the ultimate object of all my labours.Wood, Alexander. 2011. Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773‚Äì1829. Cambridge University Press. p. 173 Gurney stated that Young \\"retained a good deal of his old creed, and carried to his scriptural studies his habit of inquisition of languages and manners,\\" rather than the habit of proselytism.Wood, Alexander. 2011, p. 56 Yet, the day before his death, Young participated in religious sacraments; as reported in David Brewster's Edinburgh Journal of Science: \\"After some information concerning his affairs, and some instructions concerning the hierographical papers in his hands, he said that, perfectly aware of his situation, he had taken the sacraments of the church on the day preceding... His religious sentiments were by himself stated to be liberal, though orthodox. He had extensively studied the Scriptures, of which the precepts were deeply impressed upon his mind from his earliest years; and he evidenced the faith which he professed; in an unbending course of usefulness and rectitude.\\"Brewster, David. 1831.

Early life Pelagius was a Visigoth nobleman, the son of Fafila. The Chronica Albeldensis says that this Fafila was a dux of Gallaecia, who was killed by Wittiza. The Chronicle of Alfonso III identifies Pelagius as a grandson of Chindasuinth and says that his father was blinded in C√≥rdoba, at the instigation of Wittiza. Wittiza is also said to have exiled Pelagius from Toledo upon assuming the crown in 702. In the opinion of Roger Collins, this is a late tradition and the account of the Albeldensis, which locates Pelagius' origins in the north of the peninsula, is more credible. Both chronicles agree, however, that he was a Visigoth who was exiled from Toledo by Wittiza. According to the later tradition, Munuza, the Berber governor of Iegione (either Gij√≥n or Le√≥n), became attracted to Pelagius' sister and sent word to Tariq ibn Ziyad, who ordered him to capture Pelagius and send him to C√≥rdoba. If Munuza's seat is identified with Gij√≥n, it may be inferred that the Arabs had established their rule in the Asturias and that Pelagius was not the leader of a local resistance to Arab conquest. Pelagius may have come to terms with the Arab elite whereby he was permitted to govern locally in the manner of the previous Visigoths, as is known to have occurred between Arab rulers and Visigothic noblemen elsewhere, as in the case of Theudimer, although most historians consider this unlikely. Reign At some point Pelagius is said to have rebelled, but for what reasons is unknown; such rebellions by local authorities against their superiors formed a common theme in Visigothic Spain. A Muslim army was sent against him under the command of Alkama and the Christian bishop of Seville, Oppa. That Alkama was the general and that there was a bishop of Seville named Oppa among his ranks is generally accepted. A battle was fought near Covadonga (in monte Auseva or in monte Libana) in which Alkama was killed and Oppa captured. Moorish chronicles of the event describe Pelagius and his small force as \\"thirty wild donkeys\\", as reported by al-Maqqari in the 17th century.\\"Extract from C. S√°nchez Albornoz and M. Antu√±a's Fuentes de la historia hispano-musulmana del siglo VIII featuring a translation of an excerpt from Al Maqqari's Nafh al-Tib\\" in the on-line Biblioteca Cervantes (Spanish) The battle is usually dated to 718 or 719, between the governorships of al-Hurr and as-Sham, though some have dated it as late as 722 and the Chronica Albeldensia dates it in the 740s. After his election as princeps (prince, principal leader) of the Asturians by the local magnates in the Visigothic manner, Pelagius made his capital at Cangas de On√≠s. The ' says about this election: > And he [Pelagius], going to his mountainous lands, gathered all those who > were going to council and ascended a big mountain named Asseuua. He spread > his orders between all the Astures, who gathered in council and elected > Pelagius as their princeps. His kingdom, firstly centred on the eastern Asturias, soon grew. He married his daughter Ermesinda to the future king Alfonso I, son of Pelagius' eastern neighbour, Duke Peter of Cantabria. Pelagius reigned for eighteen or nineteen years until his death in 737, when he was succeeded by his son Fafila. He was buried in the church of Santa Eulalia de Abamia, located in the surroundings of the village of Corao, near Cangas de On√≠s. His remains were transferred by King Alfonso X of Castile to the Holy Cave of Covadonga, as were those of his wife Gaudiosa and his sister. He left, in addition to his son and successor Fafila, a daughter, Ermesinda, who was to become progenitress, along with King Alfonso I of Asturias (\\"Alfonso the Catholic\\"), of the later royalty of Asturias. Historiography Imaginary portrait by Luis de Madrazo. The chief sources for Pelagius's life and career are two Latin chronicles written in the late ninth century in the kingdom he founded. The first is the Chronica Albeldensia, written at Albelda towards 881, and preserved in the Codex Vigilanus, with a continuation to 976. The latter is the Chronicle of Alfonso III, which was revised in the early tenth century and preserved in two textual traditions that diverge in several key passages: the ', preserved in the C√≥dice de Roda, and the ', supposedly written by Sebastian, Bishop of Salamanca (910‚Äì913). The only likely earlier written sources from which these chroniclers could derive information are regnal lists.

It is an analog pulse modulation scheme in which the amplitudes of a train of carrier pulses are varied according to the sample value of the message signal. Demodulation is performed by detecting the amplitude level of the carrier at every single period. Types There are two types of pulse amplitude modulation: # Single polarity PAM: In this, a suitable fixed DC bias is added to the signal to ensure that all the pulses are positive. # Double polarity PAM: In this, the pulses are both positive and negative. Pulse-amplitude modulation is widely used in modulating signal transmission of digital data, with non-baseband applications having been largely replaced by pulse-code modulation, and, more recently, by pulse- position modulation. In particular, all telephone modems faster than 300 bit/s use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). (QAM uses a two-dimensional constellation). The number of possible pulse amplitudes in analog PAM is theoretically infinite. Digital PAM reduces the number of pulse amplitudes to some power of two. For example, in 4-level PAM there are 2^2 possible discrete pulse amplitudes; in 8-level PAM there are 2^3 possible discrete pulse amplitudes; and in 16-level PAM there are 2^4 possible discrete pulse amplitudes. Uses =Ethernet= Some versions of the Ethernet communication standard are an example of PAM usage. In particular, 100BASE-T4 and BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard, use three-level PAM modulation (PAM-3), 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet uses five-level PAM-5 modulation and 10GBASE-T 10 Gigabit Ethernet uses a Tomlinson-Harashima Precoded (THP) version of pulse- amplitude modulation with 16 discrete levels (PAM-16), encoded in a two- dimensional checkerboard pattern known as DSQ128. 25 Gigabit Ethernet and some copper variants of 100 Gigabit Ethernet and 200 Gigabit Ethernet use PAM-4 modulation. =GDDR6X= GDDR6X, developed by Micron and Nvidia and first used in the Nvidia RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards, uses PAM4 signaling to transmit 2 bits per clock cycle without having to resort to higher frequencies or two channels or lanes with associated transmitters and receivers, which may increase power or space consumption and cost. Higher frequencies require higher bandwidth, which is a significant problem beyond 28Ghz when trying to transmit through copper. PAM4 costs more to implement than earlier NRZ (non return to zero, PAM2) coding partly because it requires more space in integrated circuits, and is more susceptible to SNR (signal to noise ratio) problems. =Infiniband= Infiniband HDR uses PAM-4 encoding on some physical link types. =Photo biology= The concept is also used for the study of photosynthesis using a specialized instrument that involves a spectrofluorometric measurement of the kinetics of fluorescence rise and decay in the light-harvesting antenna of thylakoid membranes, thus querying various aspects of the state of the photosystems under different environmental conditions. Unlike the traditional dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, pulse amplitude fluorescence devices allow measuring under ambient light conditions, which made measurements significantly more versatile. =Electronic drivers for LED lighting= Pulse-amplitude modulation has also been developed for the control of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), especially for lighting applications.im Whitaker (January 2006). ‚ÄúClosed-loop electronic controllers drive LED systems‚Äù. LED Lights Magazine. Retrieved 2015-03-02. LED drivers based on the PAM technique offer improved energy efficiency over systems based upon other common driver modulation techniques such as pulse-width modulation (PWM) as the forward current passing through an LED is relative to the intensity of the light output and the LED efficiency increases as the forward current is reduced. Pulse-amplitude modulation LED drivers are able to synchronize pulses across multiple LED channels to enable perfect color matching. Due to the inherent nature of PAM in conjunction with the rapid switching speed of LEDs, it is possible to use LED lighting as a means of wireless data transmission at high speed. =Digital television= The North American Advanced Television Systems Committee standards for digital television uses a form of PAM to broadcast the data that makes up the television signal. This system, known as 8VSB, is based on an eight-level PAM. It uses additional processing to suppress one sideband and thus make more efficient use of limited bandwidth. Using a single 6 MHz channel allocation, as defined in the previous NTSC analog standard, 8VSB is capable of transmitting 32 Mbit/s. After accounting for error-correcting codes and other overhead, the data rate in the signal is 19.39 Mbit/s.
