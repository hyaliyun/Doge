The promenade is a rare surviving example of a Georgian promenade. The walk is just under a mile long. A number of buildings sit along New Walk, including office buildings for the Leicester Mercury, New Walk Museum and Holy Cross Priory.  History  The Corporation of Leicester laid out the route in 1785. It is believed that an ancient Roman track-way called the Via Devana pre-dated the promenade and that this track-way formed the basis for the route. The original plan of the route was to connect the area which is now Welford Road to the then racecourse - which was later developed into Victoria Park. Open its foundation, it was named Queen's Walk in honor of Queen Charlotte. The new name was adopted later at an unknown date. Houses were built alongside New Walk for the first time in the 1820s. The houses were built at a distance, set by the Corporation, of 'no less than 10 yards' from the path. The promenade was solely for the use of pedestrians - no carriages were allowed to use New Walk. The route still remains pedestrianized and is not open to vehicles of any kind. A number of controversies regarding the use of the promenade by cyclists have arisen in recent years.

It is often applied in the analysis of growth of individual plants, but can also be used in a situation where crop growth is followed over time. Absolute size In comparing different treatments, genotypes or species, the simplest type of growth analysis is to evaluate size of plants after a certain period of growth, typically from the time of germination. In plant biology, size is often measured as dry mass of whole plants (M), or the above-ground part of it. In high-throughput phenotyping platforms, the amount of green pixels as derived from photographs taken from plants from various directions is often the variable that is used to estimate plant size. Absolute growth rate (AGR) In the case that plant size was determined at more than one occasion, the increase in size over a given time period can be determined. This is the Absolute Growth Rate (AGR), given by: AGR \\\\ = \\\\ {\\\\operatorname{M_2 \\\\ - \\\\ M_1}\\\\over\\\\operatorname{t_2 \\\\ - \\\\ t_1}\\\\\\\\!} where M2 and M1 are the mass of the plant at time t2 and t1, respectively. Absolute size at the end of an experiment then depends on seed mass, germination time, and the integration of AGR over all time steps measured.  Relative growth rate (RGR) AGR is not constant, especially not in the first phases of plant growth. When there are enough resources available (light, nutrients, water), the increase of biomass after germination will be more or less proportional to the mass of the plant already present: small right after germination, larger when plants become bigger. Blackman (1919) was the first to recognize that this was similar to money accumulating in a bank account, with the increase determined by compounding interest. He applied the same mathematical formula to describe plant size over time: M_t \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\ M_0 .\\\\exp^{RGR.t} where M0 and Mt are plant mass at time 0 and t, and RGR is the relative growth rate of a plant. Mathematically, RGR can then be written as: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{M} \\\\frac{dM}{dt} In the case of two harvests, RGR can be simply calculated as RGR \\\\ = \\\\ {\\\\operatorname{\\\\ln(M_2) \\\\ - \\\\ \\\\ln(M_1)}\\\\over\\\\operatorname{t_2 \\\\ - \\\\ t_1}\\\\\\\\!} In the case of more harvests, a linear equation can be fitted through the ln-transformed size data. The slope of this line gives an estimate of the average RGR for the period under investigation, with units of g.g‚àí1.day‚àí1. A time-course of RGR can be estimated by fitting a non-linear equation through the ln-transformed size data, and calculating the derivative with respect to time. For plants RGR values are typically (much) smaller than 1 g.g‚àí1.day‚àí1. Therefore, values are often reported in mg.g‚àí1.day‚àí1, with normal ranges for young, herbaceous species between 50‚Äì350 mg.g‚àí1.day‚àí1, and values for tree seedlings of 10‚Äì100 mg.g‚àí1.day‚àí1. RGR components (LAR and ULR) Soon after its inception, the RGR concept was expanded by a simple extension of the RGR equation: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{A}{M} \\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{A}\\\\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ LAR\\\\ . \\\\ ULR where A is the total leaf area of a plant. The first component is called the 'Leaf Area Ratio' (LAR) and indicates how much leaf area there is per unit total plant mass. For young plants, values are often in the range of 1‚Äì20 m2 kg‚àí1, for tree seedlings they are generally less. The second component is the 'Unit Leaf Rate' (ULR), which is also termed 'Net Assimilation Rate' (NAR). This variable indicates the rate of biomass increase per unit leaf area, with typical values ranging from 5-15 g.m‚àí2.day‚àí1 for herbaceous species and 1-5 g.m‚àí2.day‚àí1 for woody seedlings. Although the ULR is not equal to the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area, both values are often well correlated. The LAR can be further subdivided into two other variables that are relevant for plant biology: Specific leaf area (SLA) and Leaf Mass Fraction (LMF). SLA is the leaf area of a plant (or a given leaf) divided by leaf mass. LMF characterizes the fraction of total plant biomass that is allocated to leaves. In formula: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{A}{M_L} \\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{M_L}{M}\\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{A}\\\\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ SLA\\\\ . \\\\ LMF \\\\ . \\\\ ULR where ML is the mass of the leaves. Thus, by sequentially harvesting leaf, stem, and root biomass as well as determining leaf area, deeper insight can be achieved in the various components of a plant and how they together determine whole plant growth. Alternative ways to decompose RGR As much as RGR can be seen from the perspective of C-economy, by calculating leaf area and photosynthesis, it could equally well be approached from the perspective of organic N concentration, and the rate of biomass increase per unit organic N: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{N}{M} \\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ PNC\\\\ . \\\\ NP where N is total plant organic Nitrogen, PNC is the plant organic nitrogen concentration, and NP, the nitrogen productivity, the increase in biomass per unit organic N present. Another way to break down RGR is to consider biomass increase from the perspective of a nutrient (element) and its uptake rate by the roots. RGR can then be rewritten as a function of the Root Mass Fraction (RMF), the concentration of that element in the plant and the specific uptake rate of roots for the element of interest. Under the condition that the concentration of the element of interest remains constant (i.e. dE/dM = E/M), RGR can be also written as: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{E} \\\\frac{dE}{dt}, which can be expanded to: RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{M_R}{M} \\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{M}{E}\\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{M_R}\\\\frac{dE}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ RMF\\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{[E]} \\\\ . \\\\ SAR where MR is the mass of the roots, SAR the specific uptake rate of the roots (moles of E taken up per unit root mass and per time), and [E] the concentration of element E in the plant. Size-dependence of RGR Although the increase in plant size is more or less proportional to plant mass already present, plants do not grow strictly exponential. In a period of several days, plant growth rate will vary because of diurnal changes in light intensity, and day-to-day differences in the daily light integral. At night, plants will respire and even lose biomass. Over a longer period (weeks to months), RGR will generally decrease because of several reasons. First, the newly formed leaves at the top of the plant will begin to shade lower leaves, and therefore, average photosynthesis per unit area will go down, and so will ULR. Second, non- photosynthetic biomass, especially stems, will increase with plant size. The RGR of trees in particular decreases with increasing size due in part to the large allocation to structural material in the trunk required to hold the leaves up in the canopy. Overall, respiration scales with total biomass, but photosynthesis only scales with photosynthetically active leaf area and as a result growth rate slows down as total biomass increases and LAR decreases. And thirdly, depending on the growth conditions applied, shoot and/or root space may become confined with plant age, or water and/or nutrient supply do not keep pace with plant size and become more and more limiting. One way to 'correct' for these differences is by plotting RGR and their growth components directly against plant size. If RGR specifically is of interest, another approach is to separate size effects from intrinsic growth differences mathematically. Growth analysis in agronomy Plant growth analysis is often applied at the individual level to young well-spaced plants grown individually in pots. However, plant growth is also highly relevant in agronomy, where plants are generally grown at high density and to seed maturity. After canopy closure, plant growth is not proportional to size anymore, but changes to linear, with in the end saturation to a maximum value when crops mature. Equations used to describe plant size over time are then often expolinear or sigmoidal. Agronomic studies often focus on the above-ground part of plant biomass, and consider crop growth rates rather than individual plant growth rates. Nonetheless there is a strong corollary between the two approaches. More specifically, the ULR as discussed above shows up in crop growth analysis as well, as: CGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{A_g} \\\\ . \\\\ \\\\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{A}{A_g} \\\\ .\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{A}\\\\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\ = \\\\ LAI\\\\ . \\\\ ULR where CGR is the Crop Growth Rate, the increase in (shoot) biomass per unit ground area, Ag the ground area occupied by a crop, A the total amount of leaf area on that ground area, and LAI the Leaf Area Index, the amount of leaf area per unit ground area.  Further reading  * A simple introduction into the techniques of growth analysis can be found in Hunt (1978). Further insights and discussion of underlying assumptions are given by Evans (1972). * The degree to which the various components of RGR contribute to the observed differences in RGR between plants of different species or different treatments can be assessed with Growth Response Coefficients. * Statistical testing of RGR assessed by following individual plants non-destructively over time can be done in an ANOVA with a repeated measurements design. When plants are harvested destructively, RGR can be analysed as the Species x Time or Treatment x Time interaction in an ANOVA with ln-transformed dry mass values as the dependent variable. * For experimental designs with two harvest times, software is available to analyse growth data. * One common mistake in the calculation of RGR is that plant mass at time t1 is simply subtracted from plant mass at time t2 and then divided by the time difference between the two harvests. By not ln-transforming the data, no compounding is assumed within this time period and RGR values will be incorrect. Another mistake is to ln-transform the mean plant mass per harvest, rather than taking the mean of the individual ln- transformed plant masses.

He also played Irish League football for Cliftonville, Belfast Celtic, Derry City and Crusaders. While a Belfast Celtic player, Currie played six times for the Irish League representative team between 1947 and 1949. He began his career playing at centre half, but went on to play at right half, right back and occasional centre forward. Life and career Currie was born in Belfast in 1920. He played football for amateur club Cliftonville before joining Belfast Celtic in 1944. He acted as backup to Jack Vernon before taking over as first-team centre half in 1947 when Vernon left the club. Currie played in the 1947 Irish Cup Final, in which Belfast Celtic beat Glentoran 1‚Äì0, and went on to play six times for the Irish League representative team between 1947 and 1949. He was a member of the Belfast Celtic tour party that visited the United States and Canada in 1949. Among their results was a 2‚Äì0 win against the Scotland team that had just won the 1948‚Äì49 British Home Championship. A tour brochure described him as \\"a powerful defensive pivot with a high sense of keeping his position and of quick clearance\\".

In November, he missed out on selection for the Ireland team to face England because of injury. He was under consideration over the next year or so but never selected. Playing more at right half than in the centre, and sometimes leading the attack, Currie was appointed captain of the Bradford team and took his appearance total up past the 100 mark. At the beginning of the 1953‚Äì54 season, the club suspended him for a month for going absent without leave from pre- season training. At the end of that season, he was transfer listed, and returned to Irish League football with Derry City for a \\"moderate\\" fee. He made a positive start, but his form dipped, and in November he was allowed to leave for Crusaders for an undisclosed fee. During his time with Crusaders he scored a hat-trick playing as a makeshift centre forward against East Belfast in a County Antrim Shield tie. In later life Currie and his wife lived in Owenvarragh Park in the Andersonstown district. He died in Belfast in April 1978 after a long illness.

He was general manager of the St√§dtische B√ºhnen Frankfurt from 1951 and 1967, where he was responsible for opera and plays, and initiated a new house for them after the formerly separate theatres had been destroyed in World War II. He is known for Brecht productions, in Frankfurt and at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich from 1970 to 1977.  Career  = Actor = Born in Munich the son of a merchant, Buckwitz studied German, art history and theatre science. He then decided to become an actor and completed an acting course. His first engagement as an actor was at the M√ºnchner Kammerspiele. From 1925, he worked at different German theatres in Mainz, Bochum, Augsburg and Freiburg. In Augsburg, he began to also direct plays. In 1937, Buckwitz was expelled from the as Halbjude (half Jew). He worked internationally. At the beginning of World War II, he ran a hotel in Tanganyika to 1940. He was interned by the Allies, but soon sent back to Germany. From 1941, Buckwitz was director of the Savoy Hotel in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In 1944, he was drafted to the Wehrmacht. = Frankfurt = Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt, built while Buckwitz was general manager, in 2014 After World War II, Buckwitz became manager of M√ºnchner Kammerspiele in 1946. He moved to the St√§dtische B√ºhnen Frankfurt in 1951, where he was general director (Generalintendant). In 1952, he recruited Georg Solti as Generalmusikdirektor for the Oper Frankfurt. Buckwitz suggested housing both opera and theatre under one roof. The separate theatres of the company, which had been destroyed during the war, were replaced by one house, inaugurated in December 1963. Its official name is Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt. Buckwitz focused on productions of Bertolt Brecht's plays which he directed himself, such as Der kaukasische Kreidekreis in 1955 and Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder in 1958, with Therese Giehse in the title role. He also produced works by contemporary authors such as Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, Max Frisch, Rolf Hochhuth, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Arthur Miller, Jean-Paul Sartre and Tennessee Williams, some of them performed in Germany for the first time. He tried to open the theatre to all social classes, achieving an occupancy rate of up to 90 percent. His programs were criticised by some as communist propaganda. After health problems and budget disputes with the city government, Buckwitz announced his resignation in January 1967, serving until his contract ended in August 1968. In 1962, Buckwitz became vice president of the Deutsche Akademie der Darstellenden K√ºnste. = Z√ºrich = Buckwitz was director of the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich from 1970 to 1977. His appointment there led to a fierce controversy with the journalist Hans Habe, who accused him of having once been a henchman of Adolf Hitler, in an article for the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. Habe based his accusation on quotations from the book Heimkehr: Vertrieben aus deutschem Land in Afrika, published in 1940 by the Reichskolonialbund under Buckwitz's name. Buckwitz replied that parts of his manuscripts written in 1940 on his return from internment in Tanganyika in a camp at Berchtesgaden had been altered without his knowledge before publication, while Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt and Rolf Hochhuth, among others, took sides for Buckwitz. Buckwitz was confirmed in office with a vote of confidence from the Board of Directors of the Zurich Schauspielhaus, which he fulfilled until 1977. = Late years = In December 1977 Buckwitz appeared as an actor in the role of Luis Concha C√≥rdoba in the German television film Der Tod des Camilo Torres oder: Die Wirklichkeit h√§lt viel aus, directed by .

Cuyp mainly painted landscapes, but these often included anonymous riders in compositions similar to this. By contrast, few of his paintings are portraits. This portrait is an early example of an equestrian portrait of someone who was not a member of court; previously, equestrian portraits had been restricted to only the high nobility and royalty, but in this period in the Netherlands, this was changing, and Cuyp and his father, Jacob Gerritszoon Cuyp, led this change, with the encouragement of Cornelis van Beveren. The painting shows two young men, brothers Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort (on the left) and Michiel Pompe van Meerdervoort, with their tutor, Caulier, their coachman, Willem, and dogs. In the background of the image, there is a ruined castle, likely intended to indicate the ancient lineage of those pictured. The castle does not look like the Huis te Meerdervoort, the family home of the Pompe van Meerdervoort, located across the Oude Maas from Dordrecht and to the south of Zwijndrecht. The castle was originally painted in the left middleground, before it was repainted on the right. In the left of the background, sailboats can be seen on the river Rhine and the churches and associated buildings of Hoog-Elten, Rindern, and Laag-Elten. Details The background is believed to have been sourced from Cuyp's Drawing of Rhine near Elten. Despite this background, there is no known connection between the Pompe van Meerdervoort family and that region. However, a 1994 guide to the Met notes that the landscape near Elten is similar to that of Dordrecht. Cuyp's Horsemen Resting in a Landscape; they also wear fancy Eastern European costumes. Late 1650s. The dogs are believed to be greyhounds and foxhounds, while the animal on the left of the painting is thought to be a hare. The clothing worn by those pictured would not have been common in the Netherlands and has been described as both Hungarian and Persian. The two boys and their riding instructor are wearing tight-fitting coats, known as dolmans, while the coachman is wearing a looser and heavier coat, known as a mente. The cap worn by Cornelis is similar to a Turkish turban. It has been observed that the heads of the figures are awkwardly painted and this had been attributed to Cuyp's primary focus on landscape painting. The hand gesture of Caulier was originally simply a direction, but would later have been viewed as an indication of who would quickly become the sole heir of the close family.  Provenance  It is most likely that the painting was commissioned by Adriana van Beveren, the widowed mother of the two young men, who is known to have been the first owner of the painting. However, it is also possible that the painting was commissioned by their uncle, Matthijs van Slingelandt, or her father, Cornelis van Beveren. After the death of Adriana van Beveren, it passed to Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort. It then was passed down through the family with the Huis te Meerdervoort until 1806, when it was sold by Christina Elisabeth Pompe van Meerdervoort, the great granddaughter of Cornelis. It was sold on August 20, 1806 in The Hague as Hunting Party with Three Men on Horses and a Hunter with Dogs in Foreground for 695 Dutch guilders. On April 19‚Äì20, 1825, it was sold at the Galerie Lebrun in Paris as Le Partie de Chasse for 17,950 French francs. On May 1‚Äì2, 1829, it was sold in London as La Partie de Chasse du Prince d'Orange for ¬£1,102.10. On June 17, 1848, it was sold at Christie's in London as Prince of Orange on a grey horse for ¬£556.10. On May 9‚Äì10, 1895, it was again sold at Christie's as The Prince of Orange, with his sons, prepared to depart for the Chase for ¬£2,100. On June 9, 1911, it was sold at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris as D√©part pour la chasse for either 160,000 or 170,000 francs. On June 14, 1913, it was again sold at the Galerie Georges Petit for 145,000 francs. On June 23, 1922, it was sold for the final time at the Galerie Georges Petit for 62,000 francs to Michael Friedsam, who held it until his death, at which time it was bequeathed to the Met. Since being acquired by the Met, it has been exhibited in many other museums in the United States and the Netherlands, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Dordrechts Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

Nusbaum (1887‚Äì1975), was an American archaeologist, anthropologist, photographer and National Park Service Superintendent who spent his whole life in the American Southwest, where he made significant achievements in the identification, documentation, restoration and preservation of the region‚Äôs Native American and Spanish Colonial architectural and cultural heritage. Personal life Jesse L. Nusbaum was born in Greeley, Colorado, on September 3, 1887, to Edward Moore and Agnes Strickland (Moodie) Nusbaum. His parents and maternal grandparents were members of the original Greeley colony organized by Horace Greeley. Nusbaum married Aileen Baehrens O'Bryan on September 21, 1920, whom he divorced in 1939. They had one son, Deric. Nusbaum subsequently married Rosemary Lewis Rife, a nurse, on December 11, 1947. He died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in December 21, 1975, at the age of 88. A few years later, his wife, Rosemary, published two books on parts of Jesse's work (see Bibliography); she died on January 17, 1990 (aged 82). Both are buried at the Santa Fe National Cemetery. Nusbaum was educated at local public schools in Greeley, Colorado, as well as at the Colorado Teachers College there, receiving his B. Pedagogy in 1907. Nusbaum‚Äôs father, Edward, who was a brick mason, taught him skills that Jesse drew on during later on, working at Mesa Verde National Park. Jesse Nusbaum was an early reader and photographer and developed a keen interest in cliff dwellings and other artifacts of ancient Southwestern Native American cultures. He quickly gained a reputation as a photographer while a student at the Colorado State Normal School (later the University of Northern Colorado) in Greeley, Colorado. In 1907, he graduated with a major in manual arts and began teaching at the New Mexico Normal School at Las Vegas, New Mexico. Professional career In the summer of 1907, Jesse L. Nusbaum entered his first involvement with Mesa Verde National Park when he was nominated at the request of anthropologist Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett as a photographer and archeological assistant to Alfred V. Kidder, to participate in the survey of the archaeological sites of the newly designated National Park. He spent the following summer in a similar fashion. Together with fellow young archeologists Alfred V. Kidder and Sylvanus Morley, with whom he became lifelong friend (some called them the ‚ÄúThree Musketeers of southwestern archaeology‚Äù) they recorded, documented and photographed locations of cliff dwellings and other archaeological sites throughout the National Park and on the ‚ÄòUte Mountain Ute Indian Reservation‚Äô, providing important data for future archaeological research. Nusbaum returned the following summer to complete the survey, on the West side of the Park. Then, after the completion of the Mesa Verde survey in 1908, Nusbaum went on photographing and surveying Ancestral Puebloan sites in nearby McElmo Canyon and at Hovenweep National Monument in Eastern Utah, and, farther west, to Alkali Ridge in Utah. During these summers, after he had finished the survey work, Nusbaum joined the staff of the Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett led School of American Research at Rito de los Frijoles in the future Bandelier National Monument, West of Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1909 anthropologist Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett then invited Jesse L. Nusbaum to Santa Fe, New Mexico to oversee the restoration of the Palace of the Governors that had fallen into disrepair. For this assignment, which was completed in the Fall of 1913, Jesse L. Nusbaum was hired as the first employee of the Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett led School of American Archaeology, later the School of American Research, and Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In his journal, Nusbaum stressed the importance of melding the Palace architecture with the environment, noting that ‚Äúthe Palace was begun with an adaptation to climate and atmosphere and had been fitted into the color of earth and sky‚Äù, a view he later applied again as Superintendent of Mesa Verde National Park. In this new assignment, Jesse L. Nusbaum also conducted periodic archeological surveys, investigations, excavations, and ruins stabilization in other States, together with other archeologists or persons interested with Native American cultures, such as Charles Fletcher Lummis. In so doing, he went to Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Colorado, as well as in New Mexico including the Pajarito Plateau. Nusbaum also came back to Mesa Verde for the excavation, repair, and stabilization of Balcony House, an important and difficult project that extended in October and November 1910, and was completed after a satisfactory inspection by Edgar Lee Hewett In 1911 and 1912, Nusbaum spent nine months in Washington, D. C., to work on the Southwestern 'Painted Desert' exhibits sponsored by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway for the Panama-California Exposition to be held in San Diego, California, in 1915 and 1916.. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway used some of Nusbaum's photographs of Native Americans to advertise their exhibit, with eleven of his pictures appearing in the official \\"Painted Desert\\" brochure. Some of these images were made into post cards and sold by the Railway through the Fred Harvey (entrepreneur) concessions. While in Washington, Nusbaum also took advanced courses at night and continued his advanced studies in Colorado during the summer of 1913. In 1913, Nusbaum also worked three months in the Maya ruins of Yucatan with Dr. Sylvanus Morley. In 1915, working under archeologist Alfred V. Kidder, Nusbaum began the stabilization and repair of the mission ruins at Pecos Pueblo, just east of Santa Fe. Together they worked on expanding the scientific knowledge of the site. Nusbaum also helped restore the mission church at Pecos. In 1916 Nusbaum assisted archeologist Frederick Webb Hodge with the beginning of his expedition at Hawikuh, near Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico. In 1918 and 1919, as the United States joined World War I, Jesse L. Nusbaum attempted to serve as an aviator, but was assigned as an engineer and served in France. He enlisted in May 1918 and was discharged April 1919. From May 1919 to June 1921, he was employed at the Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center Foundation in New York City. While Nusbaum was working in New York he took part in several southwest expeditions, especially one in southwestern Utah, at Hawikuh Pueblo and at a Basketmaker culture cave named ‚ÄòDu Pont‚Äô from its financial backer. On this expedition, Nusbaum found himself at the core of Southwest archaeology, as questions of Basketmaker culture were then under intense research. In 1921, while still in New York, he was selected by Stephen Mather, Director of the National Park Service and Arno B. Cammerer, his deputy, to become Superintendent at Mesa Verde National Park, with a goal to significantly improve the ways the National Park was organized and managed. Nusbaum proved to be a very effective Superintendent, advancing the development of the Park and preserving its archeological resources. He discontinued grazing, built a museum and developed interpretive programs, especially ones designed to explain the Antiquities Act of 1906. In 1924, as Park Superintendent, he guided the visit of John D. Rockefeller Jr. to Mesa Verde National Park, a visit which was followed by several donations to the Park by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family. His involvement with the Antiquities Act of 1906 led to his designation in 1927 as the lead archeologist and prime enforcer of the Act for the Southwest, while remaining Mesa Verde superintendent. It was in this capacity that Jesse L. Nusbaum issued in November 1929 a report to the Department of the Interior raising concerns about the damages caused by an increasing number of visitors on Pueblo ruins, including theft and vandalism. He recommended measures towards a better education of the public and a better organization of visits. Nusbaum continued this dual capacity of National Park Service Superintendent and archeologist until January 1930, when he took a leave of absence subsequent to the Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur approving his appointment as Acting Director of the new Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe, New Mexico. This new laboratory was created to focus on ancient Southwestern Native American cultures, and was initially funded with several hundred thousand Dollars by several prominent personalities, including and mostly John D. Rockefeller Jr.. In 1947, the Laboratory of Anthropology and the Museum of New Mexico were merged into the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Santa Fe, New Mexico. Nusbaum continued as director of the Laboratory of Anthropology until 1935, having earlier returned to the National Park Service and resumed his dual duties as Mesa Verde National Park Superintendent and Department of the Interior archeologist enforcing the Antiquities Act. Nusbaum continued this dual position for many years, serving a combined total of seventeen years as Mesa Verde National Park Superintendent, from June 3, 1921, to January 1946, with interruptions for additional temporary assignments. In 1946 he left Mesa Verde National Park and his dual role for Santa Fe, New Mexico. At the National Park Service regional office there, he took up increased duties as the senior archeologist of the NPS. In this capacity, Nusbaum began one of the first salvage archeology projects when he persuaded El Paso Natural Gas Company to allow archeological excavation along their pipelines. For his many other accomplishments, Jesse L. Nusbaum received the Distinguished Service Award from the Department of the Interior in 1954, with Horace M. Albright, a former Director of the National Park Service, stating that Jesse L. Nusbaum was ‚Äúone of the best Superintendents we ever had.‚Äù After a year's extension Nusbaum was forced to retire from the National Park Service at the age of 71 in 1957. Residing on Santa Fe, New Mexico, he remained involved in archeology and with Mesa Verde, providing advice and contributing to various books and publications. He died in Santa Fe, New Mexico in December 1975, at the age of 88. In January 1981, the National Park Service inhouse magazine, 'The Courier', published a 'Person of the Month' article dedicated to Jesse L. Nusbaum, titled \\"Jesse L. Nusbaum: Defender of American antiquities\\".. The article is illustrated by several photographs of Jesse L. Nusbaum at work at Mesa Verde National Park. The National Park Service (NPS) History Collection, Harpers Ferry Center, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia holds some of Nusbaum‚Äôs correspondence and papers. These papers were given by his wife, Rosemary L. Nusbaum. They were generated and collected by her husband during his service as NPS archeologist.

Nusbaum which can be reached online During his younger days, and throughout his career, Jesse L. Nusbaum took many photographs of southwestern Native American people, mostly Navajo and Pueblo, and of sites, buildings and villages, as well as of other archeologists and their colleagues and friends. Many of these historical photos are archived and retrievable at a few institutions, i.e. mostly the Smithsonian, the University of New Mexico and the Santa Fe Palace of the Governors archives.

Commission and construction  The name Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario translates into English directly as \\"Our Lady of the Rosary\\", a religious reference to the Virgin Mary. The names of contemporary Spanish ships commonly had religious undertones as with general Spanish naming traditions of the period. Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario was likely commissioned sometime in the mid 1580s though the exact date is unknown and was laid down and constructed at Ribadeo, Lugo, Galicia. She was designed by Spanish shipbuilder Vicente Alvarez. She was launched in 1587 and handed over to the Armada Real at Corunna.  Service  Soon after her construction, Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario joined the forces gathering for the Spanish Armada in May of 1588 under the command of Teniente General Don Pedro de Vald√©s at Corunna. She was recorded as having been at Corunna on 13 July 1588, and was subsequently damaged in collisions on 31 July 1588. Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario entered the English Channel together with the Spanish Armada. She was the flagship of Don Pedro de Vald√©s who commanded the Escuadura de Andalucia which formed up the second line left flank of the fleet. During the actions of 1 August 1588, the Escuadura de Andalucias together with much of the Spanish center maneuvered to support Santa Ana. It was at this time that Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario began to drift and was taken off by the current in the opposite direction of the fleet and closer to the English. On 1 August 1588, Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario was taken in an action by the English second rate, Revenge in the English Channel and sent into Torbay. Thereafter, she was brought to Dartmouth and then to Chatham where she was dry docked and eventually sunk to support a wharf.

At the age of 15, he ran away from home and went to Katowice, where he met Tadeusz O., a 52-year-old homosexual who took him under his roof and gave him little money. In 2002, when Musiatowicz was 16, with a context of financial disputes, he hit Tadeusz on the head with a hammer. Leaving him unconscious, the youngster then set the apartment on fire. Tadeusz O. later died in the hospital. Because he was a minor at the time of the crime, Musiatowicz was sentenced to only 6 years imprisonment. After leaving prison, his behavior worsened, and he began attacking shops. In 2014, he tried to rob a grocery store, terrifying the saleswoman by putting a knife to her neck, but was tackled by a customer.

However, for an unknown reason, the businessman did not report the attack and Musiatowicz got away with it. The criminal was later detained by police and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for robbing the grocery shop, after leaving prison only eight months earlier. His parents abandoned him, considering him a bandit, thief and psychopath. He had nowhere to go, and joined a group of homeless scrap collectors who camped in a forest at Jask√≥≈Çcza Street in Zabrze. The men living there drank everything that contained alcohol. One day, one of them - Daniel, got drunk and went towards the campfire, losing his toes as a result. Eryk O. and Miros≈Çaw N., who were also homeless, did not help Daniel out. Musiatowicz told Daniel \\"they must be cleaned up\\". In February 2014, Musiatowicz killed Miros≈Çaw N. with an axe, and with Daniel's help, buried the body. Eryk O. initially avoided his demise because he was arrested, only to be released two months later. Immediately after, he was killed by Musiatowicz, and again, with Daniel's help, the body was buried near the previous one. Two days later, the police started searching the area, because they had received information about bodies being buried in the area. Musiatowicz was arrested, and psychiatric tests showed he was sane. He had no remorse for his actions. In 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders. He will be able to apply for early release after forty years, in 2055.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. In 2017, a mixed-use development project was announced for the property, to be renamed The Mill at Vicksburg. History The paper industry was established in the Kalamazoo River Valley in 1866, with the opening of the first paper mill in the area. The industry expanded through the valley, and by the end of the century was a major contributor to the economy of the region. In 1903 George E. Bardeen, who owned another paper mill in the area, partnered with investors Fred Lee, William Howard, and Charles Seitz to propose the establishment of a new paper mill in Vicksburg. The village supported the idea, and later the year the men incorporated the Lee Paper Company, with Frederick Lee as the major shareholder and president. The company hired Daniel J. Albertson as the engineer and architect of the firm, and the Charles A. Moses Company of Chicago to construct the mill buildings. Construction on the mill started in 1904, and production in the new facility began in early 1905. The company struggled during its first years, but starting in 1911 hit a period of prosperity, helped along by the World War I economic boom in the later 1910s. However, an economic slowdown in the early 1920s, and the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, nearly ruined the company. However, better conditions in the later 1930s, and the spike in business from World War II, meant that the company could expand operations. This continued until 1959, when the Lee Paper Company merged with Simpson Timber Company to form the Simpson Lee Paper Company. More mergers followed, as the company was absorbed into the Simpson Paper Company in 1971, and then the Fox River Paper Company in 1996. The mill continued to operate until 2001. After 2001, the mill property was purchased by a private group, the Mill of South County LLC. However, the property remained vacant, and Kalamazoo County government acquired the property in 2013 in a \\"tax reversion\\" action. In 2017, a mixed-use development project was announced for the property, to be renamed The Mill at Vicksburg. The first portions of the redevelopment are expected to be completed in 2022 and it is currently the site of an artist's residency. Description The Lee Paper Company Mill Complex consists of thirty separate buildings, most of them interconnected, sited on a parcel. Fifteen of the buildings, which contain the majority of the square footage, contribute to the historic character of the site. The buildings date from 1904 to 1990, with the majority built during the original construction of the mill in 1904. The buildings range from two to five stories in height, and are mostly brick, with some concrete block and steel buildings intermingled. The oldest of the buildings have load-bearing brick walls with low gable roofs, with slow- burning timber frame construction on the interior. The walls are of cream- colored brick, with corbelling along the roofline. The windows are large multi-light (originally double-hung 12-over-12 or 16-over-16) wood units in jack arch openings with concrete sills. Many windows have been subsequently filled in.

It is known by several other common names, including aneilema, wart-removing herb, Asian spiderwort, and marsh dayflower. The alternate-leaved plant has succulent, prostrate stems 12 to 20 inches long, and forms new roots at the lower nodes. Three-petaled, perfect flowers, white to bluish-purple or pink, are found in the upper leaf axils and at the ends of stems. The fruit is a capsule with several small seeds. A plant of freshwater marshes and the edges of ponds and streams, Murdannia keisak is associated with the growing of rice in east Asia, where it is native to China, Japan, Korea, and Tibet. Murdannia keisak is an introduced species in the United States. First records in Louisiana and South Carolina date from the 1920s and 1930s. It is most likely that Murdannia keisak accompanied rice imported for agriculture. Evidence also suggests that the plant was present decades before its first collection. Populations are established in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern US, from New Jersey to Florida and west to Arkansas and Louisiana; it is also known from the Columbia River estuary between Washington and Oregon. Murdannia keisak can spread aggressively, crowding out other vegetation and forming a solid mat. It can disperse by its small seeds, which are a preferred food of ducks and other waterfowl; it can also reproduce vegetatively.

Complete or partial amnesia of the episodes may be present.  Signs and symptoms  Confusional arousals are accompanied by mental confusion and disorientation, relative lack of response to environmental stimuli, and difficulty of awakening the subject. Vocalisation accompanied with coherent speech is common. Patients may appear upset and some of them become aggressive or agitated. As well as for children, attempting of awakening or consoling an adult patient may increase agitation. Confusional arousals can occur during or following an arousal of deep sleep (see slow-wave sleep) and upon an attempt of awakening the subject from sleep in the morning. In children, confusional arousals can often be reproduced artificially by awakening the child during deep sleep. However, it doesn‚Äôt have any clinical significance without deeper investigation. Children living an episode of confusional arousal typically sit up in bed, whimper, cry, moan, and may utter words like ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúgo away‚Äù. They remain distressed and inconsolable despite all parental efforts. Paradoxically, parental efforts can rather increase agitation of the child. The onset of symptoms is usually within 2 and 3 hours of sleep onset (at the time of transition from slow-wave sleep to a lighter sleep stage) and those events can last from 10 to 30 minutes. Patients generally wake up without any recollection of the event. It is necessary to distinguish confusional arousals in adults from children. = Neurological symptomatology = Confusional arousals are associated with behavioural awakening with persistent slow-wave electroencephalographic activity (see slow-wave sleep) during Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). It suggests that sensorimotor network is activated while non sensorimotor areas are still \\"asleep\\". The altered state of consciousness may be explained by a hypersynchronous delta activity (see delta wave) in network involving the frontoparietal cortices (suggesting to be \\"asleep\\"), and higher frequency activities in sensorimotor, orbitofrontal, and temporal lateral cortices (suggesting an \\"awakening\\"). = Sleep-related violence and abnormal sexual behaviours = Confusional arousals have often been linked to sleep-related violence (self-injury or injury to the bed partner). The latter highlights important medical and legal issues when such behaviours are suspected and purported to have caused a criminal offense. The first documented case of homicide as a result of confusional arousal was reported in medieval times by the case of the Silesian woodcutter Bernard Schedmaizig. Sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviours (also called sexsomnia or sleep sex) are mainly classified as confusional arousals and more rarely associated to sleepwalking (also known as somnambulism). Even if sleep-related violence may occur during an episode of confusional arousal, it remains extremely rare and there are no specific predisposition to aggression during these episodes.  Distinction between sleepwalking and night terrors  Violent behaviours in confusional arousals slightly differ from those in sleepwalking or night terrors. Above all, during an episode of confusional arousal the patient never leaves the bed unlike sleepwalking. Bed partner or parent who tries to calm or restrain the patient by grabbing him or her may trigger a violent reaction as with sleepwalkers. In case of a confusional arousal triggered by an attempt of awakening the patient, violent behaviours may occur almost spontaneously. Unlike confusional arousals and sleep walking, patients experiencing night terrors seem to react to some type of frightening image. Therefore, the violent reaction may occur if another individual is encountered or is in proximity.  Classification  = International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) = According to the 2nd edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2), confusional arousals are classified in NREM parasomnias embedded in the non-epileptic paroxysmal motor events during sleep, which include (1) Parasomnia, (2) Sleep- related movement disorders and (3) Isolated symptoms, apparently normal variants and unresolved issues. NREM parasomnias (or disorders of arousal) also include sleep terrors (see night terror) and sleepwalking. Confusional arousals are characterised by more or less complex movements without leaving bed with whimpering, sitting up in bed and some articulation without walking or terror. In comparison of other arousal parasomnias the age onset of sleep walking is generally between 5 and 10 years whereas confusional arousals and sleep terror may occur 3 years earlier. Sleep terrors are mainly characterised by screaming, agitation, flushed face, sweating and only share the inconsolability with confusional arousals. The current 3rd edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) added the sleep- related eating disorders in the disorders of arousal from NREM sleep. = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) = Confusional arousals are at the time not considered as a disorder in the current 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). This absence may be explained by the fact that confusional arousals have been understudied by the scientific community. Adding confusional arousals as a sleep disorder in the major classification, which is the DSM-V, would increase awareness and attention among physicians and patients and contribute to further investigations.  Diagnosis  The evaluation \\"should include a comprehensive medical history, a physical, neurological, and developmental examination, and a detailed description of the nocturnal events, sleep-wake schedules, and daytime behaviour‚Äù. However, the episodes have a long duration and a low rate of same-night recurrence. Even if amnesia usually follows episodes of confusional arousal, it is not a distinct trait related to severity. A video-polysomnography (see polysomnography) might be required if life history is untypical. In case of suspicion parents are encouraged to use infrared camera to record the behaviour of their child during sleep. Association of video recordings of nocturnal episodes with historical features is an important tool for both understanding and correctly diagnosing the disorder differently from other episodes of parasomnia. Confusional arousals as well as arousal parasomnias in general must be distinguished from epileptic seizure on the basis of clinical and electroencephalographic features (see electroencephalography).  Management  Children mostly outgrow the condition by late adolescence if not sooner. Management includes mainly non- pharmacological treatments and daily behaviours guidelines, but may include safety measures and/or medications if the patient is in danger from his or her behaviour: * Ensure regular and adequate sleep routines in order to prevent sleep-wake cycle to be disrupted. * Use of safety measures for the patient and family by clearing the bedroom from obstacles, securing the windows, or installing locks or alarms. *Medications are necessary if the patient is in danger from his or her behaviour. In this case, Imipramine or low-dose Clonazepam is beneficial.  Epidemiology  The current prevalence of confusional arousals varies according to the year and the sample population and is approximately 4% (4.2% in 1999 in UK sample population, 6.1% (15‚Äì24 years old), 3.3% (25‚Äì34 y.o.) and 2% (35+ y.o.) in 2000 in UK, Germany and Italy sample population, 6.9% in 2010 in Norway sample population with a lifetime prevalence of 18.5%). The current prevalence of confusional arousals in children (3‚Äì13 y.o.) is higher and around 17.3%. Confusional arousals without a known cause or associated condition is uncommon (for about 1% of cases ).The contribution of genetics and family link is strong and episodes of confusional arousals can occur in several members of the same family. = Risk factors = Some independent risk factors associated with confusional arousals have been identified. According to studies, they are shift work, hypnagogic hallucinations (also known as hypnagogia), excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia and hypersomnia disorder, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), bipolar disorder, daily smoking, and age of 15‚Äì24 years. These risk factors of confusional arousals are somehow related to mental disorders and medical conditions and affecting mostly younger subjects regardless of gender. Precipitating factors include sleep deprivation, use of hypnotics or tranquilisers before bedtime, and sudden awakening from sleep (e.g., telephone ringing, alarm clock). In the ICSD-2 alcohol intake had been considered as a precipitating factor of confusional arousals. In the ICSD-3American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders (ISCD). 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014. the relation between alcohol use and disorder or arousal have been excluded. Moreover, the alcohol blackout has been added as a differential diagnosis. These changes have important implications for forensic cases.

Flygskam is a Swedish word that literally means ‚Äúflight shame‚Äù. The movement discourages people from flying to lower carbon emissions to thwart climate change. Origins Staffan Lindberg, a Swedish singer, was reported to have coined the term in 2017. Bj√∂rn Ferry, an Olympic athlete, was also one of the first notable champions of the concept. Malena Ernman, an opera singer and the mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, also announced publicly that she would stop flying. Thunberg helped popularize the movement. The idea would continue to grow as other Swedish celebrities followed suit. The word started to become mainstream amongst English speakers in 2019. T√•gskryt T√•gskryt, a Swedish word that literally means ‚Äútrain brag‚Äù, has resulted from the flygskam movement. This idea encourages people to travel by train rather than by plane. Furthermore, it encourages people to utilize social media by posting pictures from their train trip and tagging it #t√•gskryt. Att smygflyga, which means ‚Äúto fly in secret‚Äù, is also another term that has been derived from the flygskam movement. Impact In Sweden, more people have been using the train, decreasing the amount of domestic flying. SJ, Sweden‚Äôs main train operator, reported that it sold 1.5 million more tickets in 2018 than the year prior. According to Swedavia, Sweden‚Äôs airport operators, domestic travel decreased 9% from the previous year. Figures of passengers at Sweden‚Äôs ten busiest airports decreased 5% in the summer of 2019 as compared to the year prior. The same pattern in Sweden was seen in Germany. Deutsche Bahn AG railway service reported record high number of travelers in 2019. German airports showed a decrease in passengers taking domestic flights, with a 12% decrease from November 2019 as compared to the year prior. In a survey of 6,000 people by the Swiss bank UBS, 21% of respondents in the United States, France, England and Germany said they decreased their flights in the past year. The airline industry also recognized the movement as a threat. In 2019, at the annual International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Seoul, combating flygskam was discussed. Some airlines, such as easyJet, stated they would spend tens of millions of pounds to buy carbon offsets. Ecologically, about 2.5 percent of global carbon emissions from humans come from commercial flights. Additionally, planes emit other gases such as nitrogen oxide and contrails that also have an environmental impact. At the time, the volume of flights was projected to expand, although the aviation industry was taking steps to decrease their emissions. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused global air travel to plummet as airlines cut up to 95% of their trips, dwarfing the impact of the flygskam movement.

When Seven 21 crushed its controller bracelet, the Zamurevenger was deemed powerless and deactivated by Neos' Neos Punch on its head. Since the Alien Zamu controlling it is a woman, Zamurevenger was designed with a feminine body and decorated with Polynesian tattoo. =Mensch Heit= is the main antagonist of Ultraman Neos. A personification of the Dark Matter, Mensch Heit proclaims himself as the rightful defender of the space, deeming the Alien Zamu as barbarians and drove them away from their home planet. Intending to invade the Earth, he coerced the leaders of Defense Juris-diction to hand over Esura but revealed his true colors to the Earthlings by unveiling his monster form. He had once used a spy drone named to chase Esura on Earth. After his personal assassin Grall was killed by Neos, Mensch Heit threatened Kisaragi to issue a manhunt on Esura. He would later on transform into his true form resembling a devil from Earth's ancient manuscripts. Through its horns, Mensch Heit used its ESP to subdue Seven 21 and the already weakened Neos before Esura replenished both Ultras' energies. The two would retaliate by severing its horns and destroying Mensch Heit with Neo Magnium Ray and Regia Shot, avenging the Zamu race's demise. Mensch Heit is portrayed by . =Dark Matter= The is a mysterious energy substance located in the area of outer space. For the first time in 3 million years, Earth's orbit entered this area, which resulted in the to occur worldwide, such as monster attacks in Japan as HEART and Ultraman Neos deal with the incoming threat. By the time Grall appeared, Earth has exited the Unbalance Zone as Neos and Seven 21 left the planet in aftermath of their fight with Mensch Heit. * : The first monster to appear, Arnagaruge was born from the Dark Matter influence on the microbes from Aga Mine. Its name comes from a deity revered by the locals whose associated with said mining area. Arnagaruge arises from the mountains with Nana's HRT Beater RX stuck to it, forcing Kagura to eject from his HRT Warmer and transformed into Neos. Hino fired a cooling missile, which prevented Arnagaruge from reforming its body parts as Neos fired his Neo Magnium Ray and destroy the monster after saving the HRT Beater RX. * : A school of fishes that combined under the influence of the Dark Matter. Its original size was 15 meters but grows larger by assimilating with every fishes it went to, eg. the Nagai harbor, a local aquarium and a lake. By the time it reached its final destination (Fisheries Research Station), Seagorian grew into 69 meters. After an intense battle, Neos reverted the monster into the fishes through Ultra Release Ray. Its roars were diverted from Peter of Ultra Q. * : Nozera was a creature born from 3 million years prior during Earth's previous influence from Dark Matter. As the cycle repeated, Nozera awakened from its long period of slumber and burrow its way to Shioname, Tokyo in search for its companion, Sazora. Nozera mistook a building's noise as its companion and went on a rampage until Sazora reappeared, a blast from HEART's patrol car provoked the two as Neos, later joined by Seven 21 fought against them. Nozera was killed by Neos' Neo Magnium Ray. * : Nozera's companion from Antarctic, Sazora flew at the speed of Mach 4 towards Tokyo to reunite with the former and fought against HEART members. While fighting against the Ultramen, Sazora willingly sold out its partner, throwing Nozera to the Ultras off-guard in an attempt to escape but was thwarted shortly after and became the receiving end of Seven 21's Regia Shot. * : A cicada monster born from the influence of Dark Matter, it possess a sturdy exoskeleton and a pair of sickles for its hands. It appeared from a construction site nearby the Asahigaoka housing complex and was quickly killed by a bullet piercing through its unprotected abdomen. Although received a proper burial by HEART, Backacoon manipulated its corpse into a puppet. ** : The corpse of Shildoban was utilized by Backacoon into a zombie slave through its tail, additionally usurping what was left of Shildoban's nutrients akin to a caterpillar fungus. After Hino fired on the vine, Shildoban was left as a lifeless carcass again. * : A strange mushroom which appeared in the next day after Shildoban's burial. Backacoon draws its nutrient from the deceased monster in akin to a caterpillar fungus. It first appeared in the vicinity of Asahigaoka and sustain the firepower from Hino's weapon. Later on, it developed into a monster and fought against Neos while resurrecting Shildoban as its puppet to attack the Ultra. Hino fired upon the vine that connected to Shildoban, separating Backacoon from its source of nutrients and killed by Neos' Neo Magnium Ray. * : The strongest monster in , who despite its immense strength and a creation from Dark Matter, is a benevolent creature to humans. it was nicknamed by Dr. Naruse, a researcher who was rescued by the former from several Rock Eaters. When HEART try to fetch him back, Naruse refused and wanted to accompany King Bamos. When agitated, King Bamos can grow into large proportions and kill its opponents with ease, but went berserk from killing the giant Rock Eater. After being soothed by Dr. Naruse's music box, King Bamos regained its composure as Neos revert it to human size through Ultra Minimum Ray. King Bamos is voiced by . * : Carnivorous monsters who murdered the entire research team that came to Aragami Island. Their hides are impenetrable to gunfire until Bamos saved Naruse by scaring them away, as it did the same to HEART members Kagura and Nana. The next day, a bigger Rock Eater attacked Dr. Naruse, causing an enraged Bamos to grow large and kill it. Three costumes were made by remodeling those from event attractions. * : A Dark Matter monster whose appearance happened to resemble the similarly named fictional creature from the late Professor Usami's book. It was taken care by her daughter Misaki, who believed that the monster could reconnect her with her late father and raise it in a hidden basement. Years later, it grew into large proportions and demonstrated the ability to purify sea and vegetations but brings an adverse effect to animals and would turn Earth into an unpopulated planet within 8 months. When Lafreshion resurfaced, it revealed its true colors to a disillusioned Misaki and was killed by Neos after severing its horn. Its change of face was made by the director to emphasize Misaki's delusion. * : When three local children misunderstood that their favorite roller coaster would be dismantled, they try to create a phony monster attack by notifying it to HEART and bury the fossils stolen from their school laboratory. Unfortunately, the Dark Matter radiated said fossils and brought their imaginative monster to life. It was killed by Ultraman Neos and reverted to its fossil components. * : A creature born from space microorganisms mutated by Dark Matter, it absorbed all of Earth's satellites and absorbed the HEART Beater SX boarded by Captain Minato. To make matters worse, a self destruct bomb was activated and would detonate an area within 300 km radius within 12 hours. The next day, Giga Dread awakened and try to thwart the HEART members until Neos and Seven 21 appeared. Once Giga Dread was elevated to space, Neos rescued Captain Minato from the monster's own explosion. * : The last monster to appear in the series, it is a combination of all Dark Matter-based organisms from outer space and was among those who banished the Alien Zamu race from their planet. It went to Earth and destroyed all members save for Esura, who managed to evade its detection. As Grall marched its way to Esura, HEART members fought against it and Kagura joined in as Neos. Neos managed to defeat the monster but at the expense of his own health when Grall drained most of his energies beforehand. =Other= * : An who appeared in the Mayday's music video, fighting Ultraman Neos in Taiwan.

History Ward McAllister, the self-appointed arbiter who is best known today for revealing the names of New York society's The Four Hundred to The New York Times in 1892, and three others, including Robert George Remsen, founded the \\"Society of Patriarchs\\" in 1872 and served as its president until his death in 1895. According to McAllister: > \\"The object we had in view was to make these balls thoroughly > representative; to embrace the old colonial New-Yorkers, our adopted > citizens, and men whose ability and integrity had worn the esteem of the > community, who formed an important element in society. We wanted the money > power, but not in any way to be controlled by it. Patriarchs were chosen > solely for their fitness, on each of them promising to invite to each ball > only such people as would do credit to the ball.\\" The Society was initially a group of 25 gentlemen from New York Society who funded the balls. The group of 25 were \\"representative men of worth, respectability, and responsibility,\\" and included William Collins Whitney (the Secretary of the Navy under President Grover Cleveland) and James Powell Kernochan, William Watts Sherman, and George G. Haven. In the 1880s, the list was increased from twenty-five to fifty, at which time Charles Lanier, August Belmont, Buchanan Winthrop, William R. Travers, Cornelius Vanderbilt II and J. Pierpont Morgan became members. The Society, which lasted for approximately twenty-five years, was disbanded on April 9, 1897, two years after McAllister's death, reportedly due to a lack of interest. The increase in the number of private ballrooms and desire for less structured entertainment led many of the younger generation to resist the Patriarch's and their balls, which came to be known as the \\"Dowager's balls.\\" =Patriarch's Ball= Beginning with the winter 1885-1886 social season in New York, the Patriarchs began throwing a ball each year, known as the Patriarchs Ball, which was modeled on the Almack's Ball of the British aristocracy. Each member of the Society was entitled to invite nine people, four ladies and five gentlemen, to the ball, thereby making invitations difficult to obtain and subsequently establishing the invitees as deemed fit for society. The first Patriarchs Ball was held on December 13, 1881 at Delmonico's, with 375 guests and Col. DeLancey Astor Kane led the first cotillion. The Ball received significant press coverage, as did all subsequent balls. The Ball generally started late in the evening, around ten o'clock, and after guests arrived, they were divided by sex to separate dressing rooms before entering the ballroom for dancing until dinner was served, after midnight, which was usually French cuisine. International guests, generally European aristocrats, were often invited to the Balls. In 1890, the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, the Hon. Henry G. Edwardes (a British diplomat), Count Arco Valley, Baron Jean Rarignon, the Viscomte de Richmont, the Marquise de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, Baron Speck von Sternburg, and the Marquise de Choiseul, among others. =Legacy= The Patriarchs Ball inspired similar balls, including the Assembly Ball (thrown by fifty prominent society women who were largely the wives of the fifty Patriarchs) and the Ihpetonga Ball, which was considered \\"the most important social event of the season in Brooklyn.\\" References External links * Festivities of the Gilded Age ‚ÄúSeason‚Äù at the Museum of the City of New York.

Overview In the book, Raymond Stephanson examines how the male literary establishment in England between 1650 and 1750 used metaphors of male genitalia and sexuality as rhetorical expressions of literary work and achievement. He devotes a great deal of his argument to Alexander Pope, in whose work, Stephanson contends, these genital references have an especially prominent place. Reception The Yard of Wit: Male Creativity and Sexuality, 1650‚Äì1750 was widely and mostly positively reviewed in academic journals. G. D. Fulton, reviewing the book in the Canadian Journal of History, said \\"Professor Stephanson's title, 'the yard of wit,' functions throughout the study as a shorthand reference to the strikingly different, even mutually contradictory ways in which a wide range of discourses‚Äîscientific, medical, judicial, literary, erotic, pornographic‚Äîused male genitalia to understand and evaluate male personality, creativity, and relations to other men.\\" Fulton also noted the care with which Stephanson handled the theme of male genitalia: \\"Professor Stephanson also respects his audience. It may not be possible to write about this topic with what all readers will consider consistently good taste, but he writes tactfully, mentioning rather than using taboo words wherever possible and relying on elegant variation to name what must be named most often: an ingenious, well-calculated deployment of 'yard,' 'pintle,' 'pego,' and other eighteenth-century synonyms for 'penis.'\\" George E. Haggerty, writing in the Journal of the History of Sexuality, found that Stephanson's book did justice to the > vast range of literary material from this period that takes as its subject > the size, functionality, and production of the male member. Variously called > the yard, the pego, the pintle, the prick, and so forth, the penis is shown > in this study to be a central overriding metaphor for male creativity. > Stephanson explains how various \\"collective metaphorical equations played a > significant role in establishing the widespread associations of the male > mind as sexualized body,\\" and he sets out to show how this physiological > system came to mark the literature of the period in general, not just in the > work of libertine apologists but in fiction, satire, poetry, and pamphlet > writing of various kinds. In addition, he hopes to show how \\"Pope became the > first public emblem of these developments, symbolizing the first commercial > traffic in the yard to wit.\\" Hugh Ormsby-Lennon in the University of Toronto Quarterly judged the book a success: \\"Stephanson's range of reading and allusion is impressive. . . . This is a compelling and eye-opening book, both for its bold thesis and for the coruscating light it sheds upon the workaday world of writing as well as upon major works ranging from Rochester's unbuttoned satires and lyrics to Tristram Shandy and to Pope's less familiar but disconcertingly phallic poems.‚Äù Linda Zionkowski, reviewing The Yard of Wit in Eighteenth-Century Fiction, offered a highly laudatory review. She wrote: \\"Joining the fairly recent project to historicize masculinity, The Yard of Wit takes as its subject the rich early modern discourse of male creativity, explaining how different configurations of sexual tropes‚Äîboth literal and metaphoric references to the genitals in action‚Äîdefine the poetic character for male writers. This sexualized construction of authorship, Raymond Stephanson argues, both imagined creative ability as genital potency and ranked the writer‚Äôs position in the public, competitive world of the literary marketplace according to his capacity for virility and manliness.\\" One negative assessment came from Adam Rounce in The Cambridge Quarterly: \\"Raymond Stephanson's exploration of the relationship between the penis and male creativity from the Restoration to the death of Alexander Pope begins with the author's puzzled sense of fellow academics not taking his topic seriously.\\" Rounce found Stephanson's focus on the role of penis envy to be so overriding that it distorted Pope's importance in other respects: \\"[S]uspicion grows when every example is read through such a lens to the almost complete detriment of any other factor. Pope here is so remorselessly repressed and full of penis envy that it would seem a wonder to the uninformed reader that he managed to become by a distance the most considerable, successful, and influential poet of the century; Stephanson is so busy chasing him into another neurotic corner that it seems to have slipped his mind as well.\\" See also * Alexander Pope * Restoration literature References Sources  * Category:2003 books Category:English- language books Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"The Yard of Wit"},{"id":"61127277","text":"Hugo Richard Hilton Darby (born 5 October 1993) is an English former first- class cricketer.

Ellis Wooldridge for the local Church of England parish church at Yattendon, Berkshire, England. Totalling 100 items, it first appeared in four separate parts from 1894, culmimating in a single, combined version in 1899. That same year Bridges also published the accompanying A practical discourse on some principles of hymn-singing. While Bridges was primarily a poet (he would later become Poet Laureate from 1913) he was also alert to the musical settings of texts, including hymns and was associated with musicians such as John Stainer, Charles Villiers Stanford, Hubert Parry, Frank Bridge and Gustav Holst. From 1885 to 1894 he made himself responsible for the music of the village church. He had become deeply dissatisfied with the state of English hymnody in the late Victorian period: The hymnal's primary intended use would have been for unaccompanied singing at the choir stall or lectern, and its design, perhaps deliberately, hindered its use at the organ console, or even by the congregation. The music is the primary ground of selection. Thirteen tunes are plainsong, sixteen psalm tunes from Geneva, seven tunes by Tallis, eight by Gibbons, eight other psalm tunes from the sixteenth century, and ten from the seventeenth, eleven German chorales, nine tunes by Clarke, and four by Croft. There are three miscellaneous eighteenth-century tunes and one early Italian one. There was little from the Victorian tune writers; rather he included seven tunes by co-editor Wooldridge.

It was the first of two unauthorised singles released in the United Kingdom (the second being Afterglow (of Your Love) in 1969). It was written by the Small Faces primary songwriters Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane. It became one of few singles by the group that features Lane on primary vocals, in contrast to Marriott's standard role as the group's lead vocalist.  Song profile  The song was released a while after Small Faces switched record labels and management from Decca Records to Immediate Records. Don Arden, who wanted to capitalise on the Small Faces success during his management, issued several songs from the Decca archives onto the market. The majority of these tracks appeared on From the Beginning, a compilation album released on 2 June 1967, while \\"Patterns\\" was chosen as the lead single. As the tensions between Decca and Small Faces were high, the band refused to promote the song, which failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart, the second to do so after \\"I've Got Mine\\" in 1965. Ultimately it became their last single released by Decca Records. The single was not released on an album upon release, and got its first release in 1976 on the compilation album Rock Roots, released by Decca. It has since been released on several re-issues of Small Faces, most notably it was included on the 2012 deluxe edition of the album, where it received a duophonic mix for the first time. Original issues of the single release are now considered rare collectibles and can sell for hundreds of pounds on the market. The B-side \\"E Too D\\", a hard rock-influenced song, was previously issued as the penultimate track on their debut album in May 1966.

He was convicted of insider trading, for which he served five years in prison. He was also required to repay his hedge fund employer $32 million it had paid him in compensation, because he had been a ‚Äúfaithless servant.‚Äù Early and personal life Skowron was born and grew up in Cocoa, Florida, and attended Cocoa High School. He earned his undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 1990. He then attended and graduated from Yale University Medical School in 1998 with a medical degree, and from Yale Graduate School with a doctorate in cellular biology. Skowron spent three years in an orthopedic residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, one of Harvard Medical School's teaching hospitals, leaving in 2001 before finishing the residency. He published a number of medical papers, including \\"Cloning and characterization of mouse brush border myosin-I in adult and embryonic intestine.\\" He was a member of the board of directors of Americares, a non-profit disaster relief and global health organization.Neumeister, Larry (13 April 2011). \\"Conn. doctor accused of hedge fund insider trading,\\" Deseret News.

He was paid in part based on the performance of the funds he managed, earning $13.5 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2008. Insider trading In April 2011, he was arrested by the FBI. Skowron was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to obstruct justice by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. According to court filings he also lied to his employer about his insider trades, and lied under oath to the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was released on a $6 million bond. According to the government, Skowron sold shares of Human Genome Sciences Inc. in 2007 and 2008 after being tipped off by a consultant to the company that the company was about to make a negative announcement regarding its clinical trial for the drug Albumin Interferon Alfa 2-a, a potential drug to treat hepatitis-C, before the announcement was made.Wachtell, Katya (21 June 2011). \\"Ex-FrontPoint Manager Chip Skowron Is Still In Discussions With Prosecutors About His Charges,\\" Business Insider.Bray, Chad (16 August 2011). \\"Ex-FrontPoint manager pleads guilty,\\" Financial Times. As a result, FrontPoint's hedge funds were able to avoid $30 million in losses, according to the government. At first Skowron denied the charges against him, and his defense attorney said he would plead not guilty, saying \\"We look forward to responding to the allegations more fully in court at the appropriate time\\".Witt, Emily (13 April 2011). \\"Skowron Will Plead Not Guilty,\\" The Observer. However, after the doctor charged with tipping him off pleaded guilty, he changed his position, and admitted his guilt. The U.S. Attorney charged the consultant with tipping Skowron material, non-public information concerning pharmaceutical company Human Genome Science's clinical trial.Hilzenrath, David S. (13 April 2011). \\"Hedge Fund Manager Charged With Insider Trading in Human Genome Sciences Case,\\" The Washington Post.\\"Morgan Stanley seeks $10.2 million from convicted former trader,\\" GreenwichTime, 14 January 2013. The consultant agreed to plead guilty to a four-count criminal information, and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation. In August 2011, Skowron pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to conspiracy to engage in insider trading and obstruction of justice. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said: \\"Chip Skowron is the latest example of a portfolio manager willing to pay for proprietary, non-public information that gave him an illegal trading edge over the average investor. The integrity of our market is damaged by people who engage in insider trading....\\" Skowron was sent to prison for five years. Skowron's wife asked the judge to be lenient with him, saying her husband didn't realize he was doing anything that could result in him going to prison.Hurtado, Patricia (16 November 2011). \\"Skowron wasn't aware he committed crimes, wife tells U.S. judge,\\" The Houston Chronicle. Skowron also agreed to forfeit $5 million to the government and pay a $2.7 million SEC penalty. The judge, noting that Morgan Stanley's \\"expectation was that Skowron would abide by policies\\" that \\"prohibited insider trading,\\" also ordered him to pay restitution to Morgan Stanley for legal fees ($3.8 million), and 20% of his compensation during the period of the conspiracy from 2007 to 2010 ($6.4 million).Whitehouse, Kaja (19 November 2011). \\"Judge to hedge doc: 5 years to heal thyself,\\" The New York Post.Katz, Basil (9 November 2012). \\"Morgan Stanley sues Ex-FrontPoint manager over insider charges,\\" Chicago Tribune.

He was released in 2017, subject to three years of supervised release. He was prohibited from working in the securities industry. Christopher Fountain, blogger of a popular Greenwich blog, wrote: ‚ÄúGreed will cause some people to do despicable things, and Skowron is an example of that.‚Äù Institutional investors immediately withdrew $3 billion from FrontPoint, which until that time had $7 billion in assets under management and earlier had $11 billion under management, causing it to shut down in May 2011, after Skowron's arrest. Skowron later said: \\"Over 200 people lost their jobs because of me. My wife and my children endured extraordinary embarrassment, isolation, and absence because of my choices because of the empire I thought I needed to build.\\" His country club ejected him. FrontPoint, which was spun off from Morgan Stanley, stressed that the FrontPoint Healthcare Funds were not charged with any securities law violations, and that Skowron breached FrontPoint's compliance policies and Code of Conduct.Heinz, Barbara (15 August 2011). \\"Greenwich Resident Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading,\\" Greenwich, CT Patch.Bob Van Voris and David McLaughlin (15 August 2011).\\"Skowron, ex-FrontPoint manager, pleads guilty in insider case,\\" Times Union.

Faithless servant lawsuit Morgan Stanley filed a separate civil lawsuit in October 2012 seeking the $33 million it paid the SEC, as well as the entire $32 million it had paid Skowron in compensation from 2007 to 2010.Katz, Basil (9 November 2012). \\"Morgan Stanley sues Ex- FrontPoint manager over insider charges\\", Fox Business. In its lawsuit, Morgan Stanley called Skowron a ‚Äúfaithless servant‚Äù who lied repeatedly to continue being paid by Morgan Stanley and to avoid a blow to his reputation. A. Jeff Ifrah, co-author of Federal Sentencing for Business Crimes, said: \\"The reputation of an employer like this one can get killed by the conduct of its employee,\\" and seeking restitution \\"is certainly a good strategy\\" to recover a company's good reputation. In December 2013 Judge Shira Scheindlin of the U.S District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled on a motion for summary judgment that Skowron must forfeit $31 million‚Äî100% of the compensation he earned from the firm between 2007 and 2010‚Äîto his employer, Morgan Stanley. The judge applied the legal doctrine of \\"faithless servant\\" to require Skowron to return his ill-gotten gains from the use of inside information to his employer, because he had engaged in insider trading, in violation of the firm's code of ethics, and failed to report his insider trading to the company. The judge said that insider trading was \\"the ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position.\\" She noted further: \\"In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations to and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset\\".

The county formed part of the Nation's Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions.  History  The county was created in 1850 as Shappaway County, a name it held until 1854. Shappaway was a corruption of the Chickasaw or Choctaw words, shapah, or ‚Äúflag,‚Äù and welih, ‚Äúto hold up to view.‚Äù In late 1854 the General Council of the Choctaw Nation renamed it Atoka County in honor of Captain William Atoka. His surname, ‚ÄúAtoka,‚Äù is derived from the Choctaw word hitoka or hetoka, meaning ‚Äúball ground.‚Äù\\"Organization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 8, No. 3: 324, 330. September 1930. Captain Atoka was a noted athlete, distinguishing himself on the stickball playing field. Those who excelled in stickball were thought to be strong, brave, courageous, and intelligent. Atoka was a leader before the Choctaw removed to the west of the Mississippi River; he was a co-signer of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. Atoka lived in several locations in and around the present-day town of Atoka, dying at his home in October 1876. His grave was protected by a shed, which was maintained by friends and neighbors until Oklahoma's statehood. It remained in place through at least 1937.‚ÄúWilliam Atoka Biography,‚Äù Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries; ‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, pp. 317‚Äì318, 324, 330. The county seat of Atoka County was the town of Atoka. This county was unusual among the Choctaw Nation's 19 counties for having a county seat that was also a population center. County seats were generally campgrounds used for tribal judicial or other proceedings. They had few if any permanent residents. Atoka, by contrast, was served by a railroad and developed as a trading center. Atoka County's boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. Its western boundary was the Choctaw Nation's western boundary with the Chickasaw Nation. Clear Boggy Creek formed most of its southern border, and Muddy Boggy Creek and North Boggy Creek formed its eastern borders. Its northern border skirted the Shawnee Hills to their south, and connected with North Boggy Creek. Atoka County served as an election district for members of the National Council; it was also a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge's duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Constitution and Laws of the Choctaw Nation, 1890, p. 312; John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plates 38 & 56; and Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.  Statehood  As Oklahoma's statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state's counties that, while logically designed, most the Choctaw Nation's counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This was not true of the town of Atoka, nor was it true of Atoka County, which included large coal mines at Atoka, Coalgate and Lehigh within its territory. While Atoka County contained more sizable towns and industry than most, it would have to be dismantled in order to accommodate changes required by the region at large. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Atoka County was divided principally into the proposed Bixby, Blue, and Moseley counties. In so doing Sequoyah's framers first established the separation of Coalgate and Lehigh into their own county (Moseley County), separate from Atoka (in Bixby County), despite the short distance between the towns.Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Although the map carried in Wikipedia‚Äôs article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell‚Äôs book offers further insight. Much of this proposition was borrowed by Oklahoma's framers two years later, who largely adopted the eastern boundary of the proposed Bixby County for the future Atoka County in Oklahoma, and formalized the split-off of Coalgate and Lehigh into an adjacent county. The territory comprising Atoka County, Choctaw Nation now falls within the present-day Atoka, Coal, Hughes, and Pittsburg counties. Atoka County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma's statehood on November 16, 1907.

Bray served as a founder and head of Department of Biology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), between 1925 and his death in 1942. Bray is credited by Nobel laureate Harold Ulrey as being an inspiration for him in switching from psychology to the natural sciences. A popular teacher at several universities including University of Montana, Harvard and Rensselaer, a prominent freshman dormitory at RPI is named in his honor.  Early life and education  Bray was born in Sheffield, England to Nicholas Bray Jr., a second generation silver chaser and Mary Ann Rawson. English-Canadian activist Roger Ernest Bray was his elder brother. A family legend credits Roger with keeping a truant young Archie in school after their father died. At the turn of the century Bray traveled through \\"most of the United States and some of South America\\" before he returned to England in 1905 to attend Cambridge University. At Cambridge Bray was a First Class King's Scholar, Triple distinction. During Bray‚Äôs time in Cambridge he was a member of the ‚ÄúAuthentic Club,‚Äù a reorganized version of the Cambridge Apostles, and served as captain of their association football team.  Early travel, teaching and graduate work  According to Harold Urey's apocryphal account of his early mentor, after receiving his natural science degree Bray was eager to travel and having spent all his money on passage across the Atlantic ‚Äústarted his sightseeing by train ‚Äì freight train.‚Äù [Thomas, ‚ÄúHarold C. Urey,‚Äù p. 221] Bray did acknowledge that during this time he toured Newfoundland for two years and taught school in Labrador. He then spent two years traveling through the rest of Canada following which Bray received a graduate degree in philosophy from the University of Oregon and then did some graduate work at the University of Montana. [phD thesis p. 42] Urey's account of his mentor was more fantastic saying Bray was traveling from Chicago with \\"nothing but the clothes on his back\\" [Harold Clayton Urey, Marie]. \\"Bray was kicked off of the train in Missoula, Montana, where he next pursued a job at the University. As he had no credentials with him, he took a job as a janitor in the university. At some point, Urey‚Äôs story goes, the university realized that they had a Cambridge-educated biologist in their midst and Bray was promoted to the position of Assistant Professor in zoology.\\" [Thomas, ‚ÄúHarold C. Urey,‚Äù p. 222] As for Urey‚Äôs account of Bray starting at University of Montana as a janitor, according to his obituary Bray held several jobs before ‚Äúsettling down as an educator,‚Äù including cowhand, muleteer, cabin boy, hotel porter, ditch digger, and draughtsman.  Teaching and mentoring at the University of Montana  Starting in 1913, Bray spent four years at the University of Montana one year as an instructor and three years as Assistant Professor. One of his early students was future Nobel laureate Harold Urey. According to Urey, Bray was a born educator. \\"Professor Bray was just a splendid, model teacher who opened up the whole fascinating world of science to me.‚Äù [Urey, ‚ÄúUnpublished Autobiography,‚Äù 4.] Urey considered his mentor ‚Äúmaster of every subject from chemistry to theology with the exception of math‚Äù. [Harold Clayton Urey author Marie...] Bray also enjoyed working with students outside of class and involved himself with the students in singing and debate. He also organized a group of young students including Urey into a philosophical club that he called The Authentic Society. In 1915 this organization became the Alpha Delta Alpha fraternity.Alpha Delta Alpha eventually became the Delta Omicron Chapter of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity: ‚ÄúGuide to the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. Delta Omicron Chapter (State University of Montana) Records 1916-1978‚Äù, n.d., ADA A history of the fraternity stated that the Society and the fraternity were modeled after the Cambridge Apostles, a 19th century ‚Äúfree discussion society‚Äù within Cambridge which consisted of the young Alfred Lord Tennyson and John Stuart Mill, among other ‚Äúmen of world prominence.‚Äù [Alpha Delta Alpha, ‚ÄúThe State University of Montana‚Äù, 1918, 2, Box 1, Folder 1, ADA] The Montana Fraternity continually grew in importance, and became one of the strong organizations of the University, intellectually and politically. Weekly meetings of the society were held; and the men were so continually together that a strong fraternal spirit developed. [Alpha Delta Alpha, ‚ÄúThe State University of Montana‚Äù, 1918, 2, Box 1, Folder 1, ADA] In its first seven years the Fraternity consistently reported the highest grade point average and graduation rate of any fraternity on campus. [Alpha Delta Alpha, ‚ÄúThe Fraternity Situation‚Äù, 1923, 9, Box 1, Folder 1, ADA. ] The membership took on extracurricular discussions and debates on various topics. Bray acted as an adviser to this group of young men; When the group went about organizing a reunion in the 1960s, they invited Bray‚Äôs widow to join the reunion and indicated in their correspondence that a photo of Bray hung in a place of distinction next to a portrait of Sir Galahad in the fraternity‚Äôs living room.[Everett G. Poindexter to Harold C. Urey, November 8, 1961, Box 100, Folder 10, HCU.]  World War I and postgraduate work at Harvard  With World War I Bray enlisted as a biologist in the service of the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in Washington, D.C., where he worked under the Harvard chemist and Chief of the Defense Section, Arthur Lamb. There Bray investigated biological methods of detecting gas weapons. [Bray, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who,‚Äù 2.] Up to this time Bray had hired Ulrey as a field biologist working for him in Montana. When Urey felt some pressure to join his fraternity brothers in military service and take part in the excitement of the war effort Bray advised his protege to join the war effort with his chemical training, telling the budding scientist that ‚ÄúA trained chemist should serve on the chemical side.‚Äù [ William R. Shelton, ‚ÄúHarold Urey, Adventurer,‚Äù in 1965, Science Year: The World Book Science Annual (Chicago: Field Enterprises Educational Corporation, 1965), 354. ] Urey's heading his mentor's advice may have saved his life as most of his 37 fraternity members who enlisted in the war effort perished in World War I. Working under Harvard chemist Arthur Lamb during the War likely led to Bray's subsequent teaching fellowships at Harvard University [A. Lawrence Lowell, Reports of the President and the Treasurer of Harvard College, 1917-1918 (Cambridge MA: Harvard University, 1919), 235.] Bray's first Harvard fellowship started September 1, 1918.  Founder then Head of the Biology Department at Rensselaer  As a founding member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute‚Äôs Department of Biology in 1925, it was as an educator that Bray would distinguish himself throughout the rest of his career. Biographer Matthew Benjamin Shindell concluded in his biography of Nobel laureate Harold Urey \\"it was Bray perhaps above any other influence that helped Urey to shed the skin of the 'conscientious, blue-eyed Indiana farm boy.'‚Äù References Category:1883 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Sheffield Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute faculty Category:University of Montana faculty Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century American biologists ","title":"Archie Wilmotte Leslie Bray"},{"id":"61127786","text":"Kamini Kumar Dutta (1878‚Äì1959) was a Bengali Pakistani politician and Law Minister of Pakistan.

This database would cover \\"all\\" Internet communications and telephony in France, which would be collected outside any legality (according to the daily Le Monde in July 2013). One reason given would be the fight against terrorism. According to the services of the French Prime Minister, the device would be legal under the 1991 law, and there would be no massive and permanent espionage of French citizens because each interception of communication would be subject to authorization of CNCIS. Device In the basement of the DGSE premises on Boulevard Mortier in Paris, supercomputers store the metadata intercepted (among other things) by listening stations spread over the French metropolitan and overseas territories. This automatic storage performed, precise interceptions can be made as needed. Thus, as recognized by Bernard Barbier, technical director of the DGSE in 2010, the DGSE collects millions of passwords: \\"The general public networks are the main target. [...] We store years of metadata: IP addresses, phone numbers, who calls who, at what hours ... And then we correlate. \\" After several years of technical and human investments, the DGSE would have joined the first five nations in terms of computing capacity, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and China. According to its technical director, the heat generated by the supercomputers is enough to heat the building of DGSE. The data collected is shared between the following intelligence services: the Internal Security Directorate (ISB), the National Directorate of Intelligence and Customs Investigations (DNRED), the Directorate of Defense Protection and Security ( DPSD), the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DRM), the Tracfin cell in Bercy, and the Intelligence Directorate of the Paris Police Prefecture. The judicial police can also appeal. Legality The daily Le Monde, which revealed the existence of this device on July 4, 2013, speaks of its \\"illegality\\", pointing out that if the law strictly regulates security interceptions, nothing is provided in the law about massive storage of technical data by the secret services1. The services of the Prime Minister says the following day that \\"all of these interceptions are governed by the 1991 law\\", that they fall under a \\"decision of the Prime Minister after the opinion of the National Consultative Commission interceptions of security [CNCIS], who then has the power to control and verify them \\"and that there is\\" a trace-ability of all requests \\". The President of the Commission of the Laws of the National Assembly, Jean-Jacques Urvoas (PS) says that interceptions of communications \\"concerning French citizens\\" are subject to the authorization of CNCIS \\"on grounds clearly defined by law And that \\"French citizens are not subject to massive and permanent espionage outside of any control\\" .

The movement emerged in the 1990s, during the period of perestroika. During that time, there were many theaters in Russia, but few new playwrights; the existing theaters produced mostly foreign plays and Russian classics. Some early leaders in the New Drama movement were playwright and director Nikolay Kolyada, who was creating new works throughout the 1990s, and Aleksei Kazantsev, who opened the Playwright and Director Center in Moscow in 1998 to encourage the development of new plays and support new playwrights.  Style  The hyper-naturalist style of New Drama has been compared to the British In-yer-face theatre of the 1990s or the Angry Young Men British theater movement of the 1950s. New Drama plays often feature violence and obscenities, the latter of which violates a former taboo in Russian theater. Critic John Freedman notes that both violence and obscenity can be unsettling to viewers seeking an uplifting theatrical experience, but that playwrights and directors of the New Drama movement favor the portrayal of the \\"essence of life as we live it\\" rather than a romanticized ideal. In the New Drama style, the poetry of theatrical writing gives way to \\"reality, simplicity, directness, and unblinking honesty.\\"  In Europe and North America  Russian New Drama has garnered the attention of Western audiences through productions in Europe and North America, such as the New Russian Drama series at Towson University from 2007-2010, New Russian Drama Festival in Austin, Texas in 2011 and 2012 and the New Russian Drama Week in London in 2018. The movement is also represented by English-language anthologies such as Real and phantom pains : an anthology of new Russian drama and New Russian drama : an anthology, and studied in Performing Violence: Literary and Theatrical Experiments of New Russian Drama.

Johnson (sometimes referred to as Bill Johnson) was the first openly gay minister to be ordained in a historic protestant denomination. He received his ordination through the United Church of Christ (UCC) on June 25, 1972 in San Carlos, California.  Education and ordination  William Johnson first received his undergraduate degree in May 1968 from Elmhurst College with a BA in English. He then held two summer student pastoral positions in Iowa before beginning his seminary in the following fall at Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, California. He attended seminary from 1968‚Äì1971 and during that time he also held church positions as a youth minister, student pastor, chaplain, and Interim Associate Pastor. In 1970, The Graduate Theological Union organized a support group in Berkeley for gay seminarians. William, having recently embraced his identity as a gay man that year, became an active member of the group. That year the group hosted a public forum at Graduate Theological Union on the topic of homosexuality and the church. The event drew in around 400 attendees. During the public forum, William came out as a gay christian and made clear his intentions of receiving an ordination through the United Church of Christ. As a requirement for ordination, William worked as a coordinator for a house church development ministry within the United Church of Christ from January of 1971 until his ordination in San Carlos on June 25, 1972. He later on went back to school to receive his Doctor of Education degree at the Institute for Advance Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco in May of 1977. His ordination is the subject of the documentary film \\"A Position of Faith\\" directed by Michael Rhodes.  Career as a minister and LGBT activist  Riverside Church in New York City, founding place of Maranatha: Riversiders for Lesbian/Gay Concerns Some of William's accomplishments in LGBT activism include founding the UCC Gay Caucus (now called UCC Coalition for LGBT Concerns) and co-founding P-FLAG/San Francisco. He has also planted UCC churches in New York and Ohio. An annual lecture at Elmhurst College called The William R. Johnson Intercultural Lecture was named after William along with The William R. Johnson Scholarship which was set up in 1999 for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender United Church of Christ seminarians. In 1974 William co-authored the book Loving Women/Loving Men: Gay Liberation and the Church with Sally Miller Gearhart. After moving to New York City in 1977, William founded Maranatha: Riversiders for Lesbian/Gay Concerns at Riverside Church the following year which was the first parish-based LGBT ministry within the United Church of Christ.  Retirement  William Johnson retired during the 29th United Church of Christ General Synod on July 1, 2013.

Left Voice. 15 July 2017.El Orgullo Cr√≠tico toma la calle: \\"El Orgullo no se vende, se defiende\\". eldiario.es. 28 de junio de 2018.  History  1997 was the year of the first demonstration of homosexual freedom in Spain, a country that has faced a messy history with LGBT issues throughout its history. The first gay pride demonstration was in commemoration of the Stonewall riots which took place in New York in 1969, and the demonstrations from there only grew as a consequence of new legislative changes such as the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005. By 2014, Madrid Gay Pride experienced a turnover of over one million people, according to the organizers. Gay pride festivals began to take place yearly in over 26 Spanish cities, oftentimes in collaboration with an array of activist organizations, nonprofits, and even for-profit companies. This resulted in what many people perceived as a turn from an active counter-culture to a spectacle for ideology to walk hand-in-hand with commercial floats of large companies. Begonia Enguix writes, ‚ÄúThe participation of commercially sponsored floats along with the large influx of tourists that visit Madrid feed the discussions on the commercialization of the event and on the relationship between neoliberalism, identity and protest.‚Äù This is a sentiment felt by LGBT communities across the world, and one U.S. citizen comments on the commercialization in the San Francisco Pride festival, saying, ‚ÄúIt just feels like a big Miller Lite tent. With the corporate floats ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs co-opting queer identity as a way to make money.‚Äù While queer activists knew that these festivals are important to stand up to LGBT discrimination and violence throughout the world, many found that the parade had become too white, corporate, and straight to appropriately show LGBT solidarity, so they decided to create their own. Since 2006 it has been organized in Madrid as an alternative demonstration to MADO, recovering the date of 28 of June to remember the fighting spirit of Stonewall with an anticapitalist, transfeminist, antiracist and antiableist perspective.Un Orgullo cr√≠tico y anticapitalista marcha masivamente en Madrid contra el capitalismo rosa. Izquierda Diario. 29 June 2017.Orgullo Cr√≠tico: \\"Estamos contra el capitalismo rosa y los pol√≠ticos en las carrozas\\". El Espa√±ol. 30 June 2017 In 2014, Spain‚Äôs critical pride festival marched with anti capitalistic stances under the motto ‚ÄúOrgullo es Decisi√≥n,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPride is Decision,‚Äù and 500 people protested. One protester said, ‚Äúwe went out on the streets to shout that Pride is struggle, it is decision, it is protest, pride is ours, it is not a business, it is not in the hands of politicians nor entrepreneurs and it will never be.‚Äù  Gay Shame  The activist collective Gay Shame formed in New York City in 1998. The movement drew on the feeling, shared by many queer scholars of the time, that the transformative potential of gay pride had been exhausted and that the term had instead become synonymous with assimilation and the commodification of gay and lesbian identity. Contrasting the exuberance, colorfulness, and flamboyance typically associated with Gay Pride events, the tongue-in-cheek image of a silent, orderly march through the backstreets, such as that presented by queer theorist Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz in his 1999 book Disidentifications, asserted that, for many, the feelings of shame and self-loathing equated with life in the closet persisted into the present moment. The movement was born at a very specific historical moment in which the city‚Äôs image was being remade from the top-down. Mayor Giuliani‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuality of Life‚Äù campaign mobilized the police force against small offenses and petty crimes, such as public urination, marijuana possession, and public drunkenness. New zoning laws forced the relocation of businesses catering to gays, particularly queer men, to the periphery, exacerbating the isolation and lack of opportunity and resources for gay social and sexual life in the city. Urban development led by private investment pursued luxury housing and other commercial interests at the expense of a community focus. Gay Shame was particularly disgusted with this urban project, with the antisex zoning laws, and the new look and feel of the city. However, some gay property owners and business people in neighborhoods on the frontline of the gentrification battle were lending their support. In fact, gay people have long been seen as playing a direct role as ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù in fringe areas who ultimately make neighborhoods safer for capital development. In this context, Fed Up Queers (FUQ) activist Jennifer Flynn states, ‚ÄúGay Shame emerged to create a radical alternative to the conformity of gay bars, neighborhoods, and institutions - most clearly symbolized by Gay Pride. By 1998, New York‚Äôs Gay Pride had become little more than a giant opportunity for multi-national corporations to target-market to gay consumers...The goal of Gay Shame was to create a free, all-ages space where queers could make culture and share skills and strategies for resistance, rather than just buying a bunch of crap.‚Äù The focus of the movement was thus not on the feeling of shame itself, but on the shamefulness of a manifestation of gay pride that facilitates gay consumerism, gay gentrification, and gay mainstreaming. The movement embraces shame as a counterdiscourse to pride and employs shame to critically engage with what they see as the shortcomings of gay pride characterized by participation in a capitalist consumer market. In 2003, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor held an international Gay Shame Conference from March 27 to 29, congregating nearly fifty scholars, critics, writers, activists, artists, students, and journalists for two and a half days of discussion, documentation, and performance. It was prompted by the celebrations of Gay Shame that were by then popping up across the US, Canada, and Europe to criticize contemporary gay politics and challenge the mainstream definition and practice of ‚Äúgay pride.‚Äù The stated purpose of the conference was to ‚Äúinquire into various aspects of lesbian and gay male sexuality, history, and culture that ‚Äògay pride‚Äô has had the effect of suppressing‚Äù and strived ‚Äúto confront the shame that lesbians, gay men, and ‚Äòqueers‚Äô of all sorts still experience in society; to explore the transformative impulses that spring from such experiences of shame; and to ask what affirmative uses can be made of these residual experiences of shame now that not all gay people are condemned to live in shame.‚Äù  Gay Pride today  Today, Barcelona and Madrid are the central places for many cultural events. In fact, Madrid hosts the largest gay pride parades in Europe. Today, Cueca, a neighborhood in Madrid, is the epicenter of Pride. During parades, The Plaza de Chueca is expected to be filled with concerts, dancing, and more. From the late 70s to today, Madrid‚Äôs pride parade has gone from a small number of people to one of the largest in the world. The parade, which usually takes place in the summer, was postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to its organization, the Gay Pride parade purpose, ‚Äúwas to defend legal equality as an indispensable requisite in the fight against homophobia, and to protect certain inalienable rights of the entire population such as education against discrimination and quality health care for all.\\" Although Spain voted to legalize same-sex marriage back in 2005, there are still levels of discrimination especially in places outside large cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. According to a 2011 source, same sex marriages account for just 1.8 percent of the total marriages in Spain since its legalization in 2005. According to a Eurobarometer survey, 66% of survey takers were in support of same-sex marriage while only 43% recignized sam sex couples right to adopt. While SSM was legalized in 2005, many were opposed to the passing of the law, specifically those of right leaning political views. However, the Prime Minister at the time, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero said of the law, ‚ÄúToday the Spanish society returns [gays] the respect they deserve, recognize their rights, restore their dignity, affirm their identity and gives them back their freedom. In an election held in 2019, Spain‚Äôs far right party Vox tooks 24 of 350 seats in congress, which was the first time a far right party sat in parliament since the death of Francisco Franco in 1975. Created in 2013, the party‚Äôs current leader, Santiago Abascal, has been vocal about his support for same sex unions as opposed to marriages, in addition to being against LGBTQ activism. Though still facing discrimination, the LGBTQ community in Spain has received much support and awareness since the abolition of the dictatorship in the 1970s, which is displayed in the size of their pride parades that are some of the largest in the world.

Early life and war service Stewart Pether was born into an Oxfordshire farming family at Oxford in October 1916. He was educated in Oxford at Magdalen College School, before going up to St Peter's College, Oxford. He debuted in minor counties cricket for Oxfordshire in the 1936 Minor Counties Championship. While studying at Oxford he made his debut in first- class cricket for Oxford University against Yorkshire at Oxford in 1939, with him making nine further first-class appearances for Oxford in 1939. He scored 103 runs with a high score of 20 not out, while with the ball he took 31 wickets an average of 20.06, with best figures of 5 for 7, which came against Derbyshire. He served in the British Army during the Second World War, enlisting in the Gloucestershire Regiment as a second lieutenant in August 1939. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in January 1941.

Transit node routing as a framework was established in 2007 and many concrete implementations have surfaced in the years after such as approaches using grids, highway hierarchies and contraction hierarchies. Transit node routing is a static approach that requires pre-processing of pair-wise distances between important nodes in the graph (see below how those nodes are chosen). A dynamic approach has not been published. __TOC__  Intuition  Multiple routes using the same access nodes to long-distance road network. Long-distance travel usually involves driving along a subset of the road network such as freeways instead of e.g. urban roads. This sub-network can only be entered by using sparsely distributed access nodes. When compared to one another, multiple long-distance routes starting at the same location always use the same small amount of access nodes close to the starting location to enter this network. In the same way, similar target locations are always reached by using the same access nodes close to them. This intuition only holds for long-distance travel. When travelling short distances, such access nodes might be never used because the fastest path to the target only uses local roads. Because the number of such access nodes is small compared to the overall number of nodes in a road network, all shortest routes connecting those nodes with each other can be pre-calculated and stored. When calculating a shortest path therefore only routes to access nodes close to start and target location need to be calculated.  General framework  # Transit node routing starts with a selection of transit nodes T \\\\subseteq V as a subset of all nodes V of the road network. # For every node v \\\\in V dedicated sets of forward access nodes \\\\overrightarrow{A}(v) \\\\subseteq T and backward access nodes \\\\overleftarrow{A}(v) \\\\subseteq T are chosen from all transit nodes. # Now, pairwise distances between transit nodes D_T and distances between nodes v and their corresponding access nodes d_A are calculated and stored. # A distance between two nodes can now be calculated as d(s,t) = \\\\min_{u \\\\in \\\\overrightarrow{A}(s), v \\\\in \\\\overleftarrow{A}(t)}d_A(s,u) + D_T(u,v) + d_A(v,t) = Locality filter = Short routes between close start and target locations may not require any transit nodes. In this case, the above framework leads to incorrect distances because it forces routes to visit at least one transit node. To prevent this kind of problem, a locality filter can be used. For given start and target locations, the locality filter decides, if transit node routing should be applied or if a fallback-routine should be used (local query).  Concrete instances  Transit node routing is not an algorithm but merely a framework for speeding up route planning. The general framework leaves open a few questions that need to be answered to implement it: * How are transit nodes selected? * How are access nodes chosen? * Which locality filter should be used? * How should local queries be handled? The following example implementations of this framework answer these questions using different underlying methods such as grouping nodes in cells of an overlay grid and a more sophisticated implementation based on contraction hierarchies. = Geometrical approach using grids= In a grid-based approach, the bounding square of all nodes is equally subdivided into square cells. How are access nodes selected? Access nodes (red dots) for a cell C (red) with inner area I (orange) and outer area O (blue) For each cell C, a set of access nodes can be found by looking at an inner area I of 5x5 cells and an outer area O of 9x9 cells around C. Focusing on crossing nodes (ends of edges that cross the boundary of C, I or O), the access nodes for C are those nodes of I that are part of a shortest path from some node in C to a node in O. As access nodes for an arbitrary node v \\\\in C all access nodes of C are chosen (red dots in the image to the right). How are transit nodes selected? The set of transit nodes is exactly the union of all sets of access nodes. Which locality filter should be used? The way access nodes are selected implies that if source and target are more than four grid cells apart, a transit node must be passed on the shortest path and the distance can be calculated as described above. If they lie closer together, a fallback-algorithm is used to obtain the distance. How should local queries be handled? Local queries are only needed if start and target already lie close together, therefore every suitable shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or extensions thereof can be chosen.  Space requirements  The pre-computed distances between each node and the corresponding access node as well as the pairwise distances between transit nodes need to be stored in distance tables. In the grid-based implementation outlined above, this results in 16 bytes of storage that is required for each node of the road graph. A full graph of the USA road network has 23,947,347 nodes. Therefore approx. 383 MB of storage would be required to store the distance tables. = Using contraction hierarchies= How are transit nodes selected? By definition, a contraction hierarchy moves important nodes (i.e. nodes that are part of many shortest paths) to the top of the hierarchy. A set of transit nodes therefore can be selected as the khighest nodes of the contraction hierarchy. How are access nodes selected? Forward access nodes of a node v can be found by running the upward-search of the contraction hierarchy starting at v. During the upward-search, edges leaving previously found transit nodes aren't relaxed. When the search has no more upward nodes left to settle, those transit nodes that have been settled are the access nodes of v. Backward access nodes can be found analogously. Which locality filter should be used? If the highest node of a shortest up-down-path in the hierarchy is not part of the set of transit nodes, then the query was local. This implies that neither the up-part of the path (beginning at the starting node) nor the down-part of the path (ending at the target node) can contain a transit node and there must be a common node in both paths. During the calculation of the access nodes, the search space (all visited nodes towards the top of the hierarchy) for each node can be stored without including transit nodes. When performing a query, those search spaces for start- and target node are checked for an intersection. If those spaces are disjoint, transit node routing can be used because the up- and down-paths must meet at a transit node. Otherwise there could be a shortest path without a transit node. How should local queries be handled? Local queries use the regular query algorithm of the contraction hierarchy.

The New York Young Republican Club is the oldest and largest chapter in the United States, founded in 1911 with predecessor organizations going back to 1856. The Club is affiliated with and officially recognized by the New York State Young Republicans and the Young Republican National Federation, as well as the county, state, and national Republican committees.  History  In the Spring of 1911, thirty-two young men, led by a young Manhattan lawyer Benjamin M. Day, along with, Philip J. McCook, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, Frederick Paul Keppel, Henry W. Goddard, Edward R. Finch, Alfred Conkling Coxe Jr., and Albert S. Bard noted the lack of any Republican association especially appealing to younger Republicans in New York City. They sought a forum for expressing views which might on occasion be at variance with those of the party leaders as expressed in the local assembly district Clubs and in The Republican Club of the City of New York. In order to work within and for the Republican Party, yet be free to criticize party policies and leaders and to champion candidates and causes independent of organization control when the occasion so warranted, these young men formed the New York Young Republican Club in April 1911. This was an offshoot of the earlier New York Young Men‚Äôs Republican Club which was founded in 1879, which itself was a descendant of the even earlier New York Young Men‚Äôs Republican Union founded in 1856. The Club‚Äôs first public appearance was a dinner held in December, 1911. The guest of honor was the President of the United States, William Howard Taft, and the principal speaker was Idaho Senator William Borah. The Club‚Äôs auspicious debut was attended by the leading politicians and office- holders of the day and was well publicized. On February 8, 1912, the New York Young Republican Club, Inc. filed for a Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State with the following objectives: ‚ÄúTo promote and maintain the principles of the Republican Party; to foster within the Republican Party and make practical in service of the municipality, state and nation, the idealism characteristic of youth; to correct in our own party that tendency of all parties to make organization an end rather than a means; to develop sound principle and public spirit in party politics; to promote honest and fair electoral methods, to the end that the expression of the popular will by whatever party or body, shall be as free, untrammeled and equal as possible; to resist and expose political corruption; to advocate merit rather than partisan service as entitling to public office; to watch legislation and to encourage public attention to and efficiently criticize the conduct of government.‚Äù  Leadership  * President: Gavin Mario Wax of Manhattan * Vice President: Vish Burra of Staten Island * Treasurer: Angela Van Buuren of Manhattan * Recording Secretary: Jaclyn Dolinsky of Manhattan * Corresponding Secretary: Alexandra Fasulo of Brooklyn * Activism Chair: Gabriel Montalvo of Queens * Advisory Chair: Jose Freijo of Brooklyn * Campaigns Chair: Zach Lountzis of Manhattan * Communications Chair: Stefano Forte of Queens * Design Chair: Jonathan Doucette of Queens * Events Chair: Kristi De Vita of Brooklyn * Fundraising Chair: Elizabeth Holland of Manhattan * Law Chair: Tyler Grant of Manhattan * Membership Chair: Ilana Marcus of Manhattan * Outreach Chair: Fernando Acosta of The Bronx * Policy Chair: Iulia Lupse of Manhattan * Rules Chair: Nathan Berger of Manhattan  Notable New York Young Republican Club Alumni  * Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President of the Untied States * Thomas E.

The stability was provided with a lower bridge level, less armament and protection (in the case of gun shields) and a keel ballast. Upon launch, Hiyodoris armament was the same as that of her sister-ships, distinguished by a set of three torpedo tubes amidships, three 12 cm guns and a single 40 mm Vickers machine gun. In 1944, Hiyodori and the surviving ships of the Otori class had their aft 12 cm gun and their single 40 mm Vickers gun replaced with several 25 mm anti- aircraft mounted in five single mounts and three twin mounts, granting her a total of 11 machine guns.

Donald Trump formally unveiled the plan in a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 28 January 2020, although no Palestinian authorities were invited for negotiations. The plan was authored by a team led by Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner. Both the West Bank settlers' Yesha Council and the Palestinian leadership rejected the plan: the former because it envisaged a Palestinian state, the latter arguing it is too biased in favor of Israel. The plan is divided into two parts, an economic portion and a political portion. On 22 June 2019, the Trump administration released the economic portion of the plan, titled \\"Peace to Prosperity\\". The political portion was released in late January 2020. The plan has been characterized as requiring too few concessions from the Israelis and imposing too harsh requirements on the Palestinians. Reactions among congressional Democrats were mixed, and all the then-leading Democratic presidential candidates denounced it as a \\"smokescreen\\" for annexation.J Street, \\"It's Not a Peace Plan, It's an Annexation Smokescreen\\", \\"If there was ever any doubt that the Trump-Netanyahu 'peace plan' was anything other than a smokescreen for annexation, it was disabused just moments after the plan's glitzy White House announcement.\\" Proposed benefits to the Palestinians from the plan are contingent on Israel and the United States subsequently agreeing that a list of conditions have been implemented, including total demilitarization, abandonment of international legal action against Israel and the United States and compliance \\"with all the other terms and conditions\\" of the 180-page plan. Many of these conditions have been denounced by opponents of the plan as \\"impossible\\" or \\"fantastic.\\" The plan rejects a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, proposing instead a Palestinian capital on the outskirts of the city. The proposed site for a Palestinian capital includes the Shuafat refugee camp, described as \\"a gang-ridden slum\\". Many Israeli settlers have expressed discontent and concern with the plan's security assurances. During the press conference announcing the plan, Netanyahu announced that the Israeli government would immediately annex the Jordan Valley and West Bank settlements while committing not to create new settlements in areas left to the Palestinians for at least four years. US Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman claimed that the Trump administration had given permission for an immediate annexation, stating that \\"Israel does not have to wait at all\\" and \\"we will recognize it.\\" The Likud spokesman tweeted that Israeli sovereignty over settlements would be declared on the following Sunday. The Trump administration clarified that no such green light had been given. No decision would take place before new elections and a new government had been formed.Yossi Verter, \\"How Trump's \\"Deal of the Century' Became the Joke of the Century\\" Haaretz January 31, 2020 Naming The Trump Peace Plan is called by its proponents \\"the deal of the century,\\" phrasing used by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a joint press conference with Donald Trump announcing the plan.Full text of Netanyahu's speech: Today recalls historic day of Israel's founding The Times of Israel 28 January 2020 Critics of the proposal were quick to ring changes on the term.

The Israel Palestine conflict The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a \\"national home for the Jewish people\\" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. The proposal was subsequently endorsed by the League of Nations as part of partitioning of the Ottoman lands. In 1917, Jews constituted less than 8% of the population; by 1947, due mainly to subsequent immigration, they comprised about 33% of the inhabitants, though owning just 7% of the land. That year the United Nations adopted a Partition Plan, which allotted 56% of the land to 30% of the population that was Jewish, although the majority of allocated land was the Negev desert. The Palestinian leadership and the Arab nations rejected the plan, resulting in the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war.Gelber, Yoav. Jewish- Transjordanian Relations 1921-1948: Alliance of Bars Sinister. Routledge, 2014. By the war's end, Israel controlled 78% of Mandatory Palestine, and much of the local Arab populace had either been expelled or fled. According to the IDF,Nathan Thrall, \\"Trump's Middle East Peace Plan Exposes the Ugly Truth\\", The New York Times January 29, 2020.Yotam Berger, \\"Figures Presented by Army Show More Arabs than Jews Live in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza\\", Haaretz 26 May 2018 Palestinians constitute the majority of the population in the area Israel now controls (Israel, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank). Both Clinton's and the subsequent Trump plan confine most of that majority to an area less than a quarter of the land. The West Bank and Gaza, occupied since 1948 by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Shortly after the 1967 war Israel began building settlements in the land, in violation of international law. =Two states= In 1974, a UN resolution on the \\"Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine\\" called for \\"two States, Israel and Palestine ‚Ä¶ side by side within secure and recognized borders\\" together with \\"a just resolution of the refugee question in conformity with UN resolution 194\\". Following the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Palestinians gained limited autonomy in a scattered mosaic of small areas in the West Bank. There followed a cycle of negotiations, suspension, mediation, restart of negotiations and suspension again. A number of agreements were reached, until the Oslo process ended after the failure of the Camp David Summit in 2000 and the outbreak of the Second Intifada.Just Vision, Oslo Process . Retrieved December 2013MEDEA, Oslo peace process. Retrieved December 2013 =The UN= Section 2 of the plan gives an \\"Overview of United Nations efforts\\" and notes that close to 700 UNGA (non- legally binding) and over 100 UNSC (legally binding) resolutions have not brought about peace. The plan says that critical recommendations are disputed both as to their meaning and legal effect and have enabled political leaders to avoid addressing the complexities of the conflict rather than allowing a realistic path to peace.White House 2020, Section 2, p.5 Of these resolutions, Dubuisson says that they have affirmed the Palestinian right to self- determination, that territory claimed by Palestine is under belligerent occupation, that Israeli settlements are illegal and that the annexation of East Jerusalem was illegal. Dubuisson also stated that Israel is under an obligation to withdraw from the territories it occupied, that all states in the region have a right to secure and recognized borders and that Palestinians who became refugees during the conflict have a right of return or to fair compensation. Section 21 of the plan stipulates that a final agreement will be proposed in a new UN Security Council resolution and a new United Nations General Assembly resolution. =Present position= Palestine has been recognized as a state by 138 UN members, and has had the status of UN non- member observer state since 2012. Israel, the United States and most Western countries do not recognize Palestine as a state. The United Nations use the terms \\"Palestine\\", \\"State of Palestine\\", and \\"occupied Palestinian territory\\" (oPt or OPT) interchangeably depending on context. Specifically the term \\"occupied Palestinian territory\\" refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. References to land or territory refer to land claimed by the State of Palestine.\\"United Nations Country Team Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" (2016), p.9 Dubuisson asserts that UN resolutions \\"establish all the principles that should guide the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\" and that the Trump plan does not apply, or even mention, any of these principles deferring instead to Israel's security concerns and the recognition of its \\"valid legal and historical claims\\". Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process since 2015, points out the dangers inherent in the current situation stating \\"There is no Middle East peace process\\".  US policy changes and development of the plan  Development of the plan began in November 2017, led by Kushner, chief negotiator Jason Greenblatt, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, and ambassador David Friedman. Kushner, a property developer married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, had no prior experience of diplomacy, asked the parties not to talk about history, and reportedly never discussed his plan with the Palestinians. According to Peter Beinart of Jewish Currents, \\"another key participant in drafting the proposal was David Friedman, who became Trump's ambassador to Israel after representing his bankrupt casinos.\\"Peter Beinart 'What‚Äôs In It For Trump,' Jewish Currents 29 January 2020 He reportedly had close ties to the Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, compared Jewish American critics of Israel to collaborators with Nazism and was skeptical about the idea that Palestinians should have a state. In December 2017, following through on a campaign promise and a 1995 US law, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. A key member of Trump's team, the Arabist Dina Powell, left the team \\"on good terms\\" two days after the announcement.Amir Tibon,\\"Amid Jerusalem Crisis, Top Middle East Advisor Dina Powell Quits White House\\", Haaretz December 9, 2017 The move was condemned by Arab countries, and Palestinians broke off contacts with the Trump administration, though maintaining intelligence cooperation with the CIA. Trump reacted by ending both bilateral aid for Palestinians and contributions for UNRWA, citing the PA's refusal to take part in the administration's peace initiative. The United States also shut down the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington. In February 2019, Kushner and his personal adviser Berkowitz flew to Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Saudi Arabia in order to unveil their closely guarded plan. Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Lolwah Al Khater gave no indication that the meeting had provided much detail regarding the political plan. Jason Greenblatt, who played an important role in Trump's 25 March 2019 recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel, was thereafter shunned by the Palestinian authority. In the Palestinian view, Friedman, throughout his two years of engagement, acted as Israel's spokesman, a country he would never criticize, while he would frequently lambast the Palestinian side on his Twitter account.Raphael Ahren, \\"Trump peace plan architect Jason Greenblatt to quit administration\\" The Times of Israel December 5, 2019 In April 2019, Greenblatt said that plan does not call for a confederation model or for a transfer of land from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula to the Palestinians. When asked in June 2019, Greenblatt said that the Trump plan \\"will include a resolution to all of the core issues, including the refugee issue, and will also focus on Israel's security concerns\\". In November 2019, the US abandoned its four- decade-old position that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. According to Israel Kasnett of the Jewish News Syndicate, the U.S. policy changes between 2017 and 2019 are described by \\"Mideast experts and Israel advocates\\" as a paradigm shift.Israel Kasnett, 'Washington‚Äôs paradigm shift on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.‚Äô Jewish News Syndicate 17 January 2018 Jane Kinninmont, writing for Haaretz, asserts that the \\"all new\\" economic peace approach has been tried before and doesn't work. When the plan emerged, Yehuda Shaul argued that, far from being an 'unconventional approach' that broke with tradition, the proposals were actually remarkably similar to the details set forth both in the Drobles Plan, written for the World Zionist Organization, and published over 40 years earlier, in 1979, entitled Master Plan for the Development of Settlements in Judea and Samaria, 1979‚Äì1983, and key elements of the earlier Allon Plan.Yehuda Shaul Trump‚Äôs Middle East Peace Plan Isn‚Äôt New. It Plagiarized a 40-Year-Old Israeli Initiative,' Foreign Policy 11 February 2020 The aim of the Drobles' plan was to ensure Jewish settlement in the Palestinian territories, while blocking the possibility that a Palestinian state could ever emerge. Former United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that in May 22, 2017, Benjamin Netanyahu showed Donald Trump a fake and altered video of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling for the killing of children. This was at a time when Trump was considering if Israel was the obstacle to peace. Netanyahu had showed Trump the fake video to change his position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.'Netanyahu Used Doctored Video of Abbas to Influence Trump's Policy, Woodward Reveals,' Haaretz 12 September 2020 Rolling out the plan In late June 2019, the \\"economic plan\\" was unveiled at a U.S.-led \\"Peace to Prosperity\\" conference in Manama, Bahrain. The Palestinian leadership boycotted the entire event. According to Bess Levin, writing for Vanity Fair, the whole conference was 'panned by experts', citing one who described it as \\"the Monty Python sketch of Israeli-Palestinian peace initiatives\\".Bess Levin, \\"Jared Kushner: Palestinians Have Never Done Anything Right in Their Sad, Pathetic Lives\\", Vanity Fair January 29, 2020 In September 2019, Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt finalized the \\"political plan\\", access to which was restricted to only Kushner, Greenblatt, Friedman and Kushner's former employee and aide Avi Berkowitz. Greenblatt resigned in September 2019, realizing, according to Martin Indyk, that the plan had no future. He was replaced by Berkowitz, a young lawyer who worked for Kushner's companies and whom, like Kushner, was raised as an orthodox Jew with deep ties to Israel. The economic portion of the plan, consisting of two pamphlets of 40 and 96 pages each that are filled with financial tables and economic projections, was published by the Trump administration on 22 June 2019. It was presented by Kushner during the workshop in Manama, Bahrain on June 25‚Äì26. The political portion of the plan was rolled out on 28 January 2020. The timing of roll-out showed a contrast between the Trump impeachment trial and the Israeli five weeks from the announcement of the plan. The US government insisted that revealing the plan now was not designed to distract from impeachment, but was rather a reaction to political realities in Israel. Amid intense partisanship, Israel has had three elections in less than a year (April 2019 to March 2020), and may yet have a fourth. Prior to the 2020 Israeli legislative election Israel had the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, with Netanyahu facilitating the formation of the Union of the Right-Wing Parties by uniting the Jewish Home party with the far-right Otzma Yehudit party. Otzma is widely characterized as racist and traces its origins to the extremist Kahanist movement. Immediately prior to the September elections, on 10 September 2019, Netanyahu pledged to annex part of the West Bank on the border with Jordan and promised to apply \\"Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea\\" if re-elected. Key concepts and final status issues The stated purpose of the Trump peace plan is to outline the terms of an agreement, to be signed by both parties, to end the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and clear all claims made by both parties to the conflict. The authors of the proposal envisage that the achievement of such a solution would endow Palestinians with the right of self-governance while denying them any powers that might constitute a threat to Israel. The successful solution will direct flights between the State of Israel and its neighbors. The Trump administration stated that it would break with the worn paradigms of past approaches to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process, removing two core issuesJane Kinninmont, \\"Jared Kushner's 'Paradigm-busting' Mideast Peace Deal Just Won't Work\\", Haaretz 16 June 2019 by implementing two measures in 2017 and 2019, that suggested the United States' redefinition of the parameters for definitively resolving the conflict in large part espoused Israeli positions. These were (1) recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital on 6 December 2017 and (2) on 18 November 2019 stating that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were consistent with international law. As a visible signal of its break with the past, the United States opened its embassy in the building of the U.S. consulate's compound in Jerusalem's southern neighborhood of Arnona at the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. Kushner has likened the plan to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western European economies after World War II. Fifty billion dollars are envisioned for the PA. The Economic Vision's empowerment by \\"doing tourism\\" was perceived as challenged by the Israel and Egypt's 12-year blockade of the Hamas-controlled territory, and 52-year-long occupation of the West Bank. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) accused the US of trying to sell a \\"mirage of economic prosperity\\" that would in reality \\"only perpetuate the Palestinians' captivity\\". Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh criticized the Arab leaders attending the conference, saying \\"The (Palestinian) people, who have been fighting for one hundred years, did not commission anyone to concede or to bargain. Jerusalem is ours, the land is ours, and everything is ours.\\" Regarding the controversy over cultural heritage of Palestinian people, Kushner said that critics of the Trump peace plan must \\"divorce [themselves] from all of the history.\\" The Trump plan was presented as the best option regarding possible future developments by Kushner who stated \\"The Palestinian leadership have to ask themselves a question: Do they want to have a state? Do they want to have a better life? If they do, we have created a framework for them to have it, and we're going to treat them in a very respectful manner. If they don't, then they're going to screw up another opportunity like they've screwed up every other opportunity that they've ever had in their existence.\\" Kushner said that the peace proposal will not include the phrase \\"two-state solution\\", saying \\"If you say 'two-state', it means one thing to the Israelis, it means one thing to the Palestinians. We said, 'You know, let's just not say it. Let's just say, let's work on the details of what this means.'\\" A top-ranking Saudi diplomat stated that the plan includes a \\"clear path leading to complete Palestinian independence.\\" Robert Malley, director of the International Crisis Group and a leading Middle East expert in former US administrations stated: \\"Strip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan's release, and the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: You've lost, get over it.\\"David E. Sanger, \\"A Deal That Has Two Elections, Rather Than Mideast Peace, as Its Focus\\", The New York Times January 28, 2020 = Israel and the proposed annexation = The plan itself places no conditions on Israel with regard to proposals to \\"annex parts of the West Bank\\".\\"What Trump and Netanyahu just unveiled was a PR campaign, not a peace plan\\" : \\"But while the promise of Palestinian statehood is contingent on fantastic conditions, the plan sets no conditions for allowing Israel to annex the Jordan Valley and all Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\\" On 29 January 2020, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he was planning to proceed with annexing 30% of the West Bank at a vote on 1 February 2020. The meeting was never scheduled as the US message shifted on their position on annexation. However, on 29 January, the US ambassador to Israel did state that before any annexation of the West Bank or the Jordan Valley took place, the Trump administration \\"wants to form a joint committee with Israel to discuss the issue\\" and that \\"it is impossible to know how long this process will take‚Ä¶we need to ensure the annexation matches the map in our plan.\\" The next day, January 30, Kushner said Washington wants Israel to wait until after its 2 March election before making any moves towards settlement annexation in the West Bank. On 2 February 2020, Netanyahu's cabinet canceled a meeting to vote on the annexation of 30% of the West Bank after receiving mixed signals from the US. On 4 February 2020, Israeli settler leader David Elhayani, the chairman of the Yesha Council, said \\"Kushner took a knife and put it in Netanyahu's back.\\" The settler leader said a senior U.S. official told them that if the Palestinians did not agree to the plan within 48 hours, Israel would be permitted to annex more than 30 percent of the West Bank. Responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing on 8 February that his government had begun to draw up maps of land in the occupied West Bank, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan, Ambassador Friedman indicated that \\"Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the plan and American recognition.\\" On 15 February, the membership of the committee was announced. It includes Friedman, his policy adviser Aryeh Lightstone, and Scott Leith, a National Security Council expert on Israel. Israeli members include Tourism Minister Yariv Levin and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer. No deadline for the conclusion of deliberations has been set. Political developments Following inconclusive Israeli elections, a new emergency unity government agreement was concluded on 20 April between the two alliances led by Netanyahu and Gantz, the \\"Likud bloc\\" and the \\"Blue and White bloc\\", respectively. The agreement includes clauses in respect of the contemplated annex of the West Bank: : -The U.S. must give its full agreement. : -Netanyahu and Gantz must engage the international community. : -After 1 July 2020, Netanyahu can bring the plan up for discussion in the Cabinet and/or for a vote in the Knesset Axios cite a \\"senior U.S. official\\" as saying that any Israeli annexations must come \\"in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support.\\" and that \\"We are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty over areas of the West Bank in the context of the Government of Israel agreeing to negotiate with the Palestinians along the lines set forth in President Trump's vision.\\" On April 30, reacting to the agreement, representatives of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Finland and the EU envoy registered a formal protest. The envoys also demanded a freeze on government plans to allow construction in the Givat Hamatos neighborhood in East Jerusalem. On 18 May 2020, the EU issued a statement congratulating the new Israeli government but which noted \\"with grave concern the provision‚Äîto be submitted for approval by the Israeli cabinet‚Äîon the annexation of parts of occupied Palestinian territories, as stated by the Prime Minister when presenting his government to the Knesset on 17 May and as envisaged in the coalition agreement signed earlier. We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to International Law.\\" At a video meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 20 May 2020, UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said that Israel must abandon its threat to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, saying such a plan would be a serious violation of international law that would \\"close the door to a renewal of negotiations.\\" European Union representatives expressed concern about the intent of the new Israeli government to annex parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley, saying it would be a violation of international law while Danny Danon, for Israel, said that \\"Any decision on the topic of sovereignty will be made solely by the Israeli government with coordination with the American administration.\\" At a press conference on 9 June 2020, Mohammed Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, said \\"We submitted a counter-proposal to the Quartet a few days ago,\\" which proposed the creation of a \\"sovereign Palestinian state, independent and demilitarised\\" with \\"minor modifications of borders where necessary\\" as well as exchanges of land equal \\"in size and volume and in value‚Äîone to one\\". At a video meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 24 June, 2020 UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, called on the Israeli government \\"to abandon its annexation plans\\" describing the proposed annex as a \\"watershed moment\\" that will constitute a \\"most serious violation of international law\\" that if implemented would \\"grievously harm the prospect of a two-state solution and undercut the possibilities of a renewal of negotiations\\". The call was reiterated by seven European nations (Belgium, Britain, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland and Norway) in a joint statement warning that annexation would \\"severely undermine\\" prospects for resuming the Middle East peace process and that \\"Under international law, annexation would have consequences for our close relationship with Israel and would not be recognized by us,\\". Subsequently repeating his call, Guterres announced that the UN is still unable to convene the Middle East Quartet to discuss the potential annex. For its part the Trump administration are in discussions about the planned annex without reaching any conclusion. U.S. lawmakers are split on party lines with more than 185 House Democrats signing a letter opposing annexation. On June 29, 2020, it was revealed that Netanyahu's coalition partner Benny Gantz would not accept the proposed July 1, 2020 deadline to start annexing the West Bank.Peter Beaumont and Rosie Scammell, Netanyahu's annexation plan in disarray as Gantz calls for delay The Guardian 29 June 2020 Gantz also announced that he would prefer that the Israeli government deal with the COVID-19 pandemic first. Despite not serving as Prime Minister, it was reported that Gantz's objection cast doubt on when a new deadline could be set. The same day, U.S. sources confirmed that West Bank annexation would not start by the planned July 1 deadline as well. = Palestinian statehood = The plan puts the Palestinians on probation, establishing a set of conditions they must meet and adopting Netanyahu's view that a shrunken Palestinian entity will be a state in name only; Israel will control of its borders, air space, electro-magnetic spectrum, foreign policy and security;Middle East Peace Plan Is Donald Trump‚Äôs Ultimate Deal Fantasy,‚Äô Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 3 February 2020. it proposes a State of Palestine with a capital on the outskirts of East Jerusalem which will not be established up to four years into the execution of the plan. The plan would be conditional on Palestinians taking steps to become self- governing. However, the sovereignty the State of Palestine would possess is disputed. Many argue the Trump plan creates a Palestinian state with only limited sovereignty, while others argue the state would not have even limited sovereignty. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the proposal gives Palestinians a chance to achieve \\"conditional, limited sovereignty\\". The Jerusalem Post argues sovereignty of Palestine would be limited as Israel would retain full security control. Israel would also control Palestine's borders and airspace. The Palestinians must: # Disarm the governing authority of the Gaza Strip, Hamas, together with Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine and all Palestinians under their authority; # Recognize Israel as a Jewish State; # Refrain from any attempt to join any international organization without the consent of the State of Israel; # Take no action, and shall dismiss all pending actions, against the State of Israel, the United States and any of their citizens before the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and all other tribunals; # Take no action against any Israeli or United States citizen before Interpol or any non- Israeli or United States (as applicable) legal system; # Immediately terminate the paying of \\"prisoner & martyr payments\\" (defined as salaries to the families of terrorists serving sentences in Israeli prisons, as well as to the families of deceased terrorists). Jonathan Cook states that this part of the plan would require the Palestinian Authority to strip \\"welfare payments\\" for \\"the families of political prisoners and martyrs killed by the Israeli army\\" and to develop humanitarian and welfare programs to provide essential services and support to Palestinians in need that are not based upon the commission of terrorist acts. The stated goal is have the Palestinian Authority pass laws regarding militants who have been convicted by Israeli courts of a charge of 'terrorism' in a way that will make those laws consistent with the laws of the United States. After these and every other step laid out by the Trump plan have been taken successfully, the plan would reach its final stage, consisting in the recognition of the State of Palestine, an entity so defined that Aaron David Miller calls it a 'faux state'. Israel and the United States stated that the following conditions (see: ¬ß Recognition Criteria) \\"must be determined to have occurred by the State of Israel and the United States, jointly\\".Peace plan, page 34 On 29 January 2020, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem was \\"not for sale; All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain.\\" Hamas rejected the deal on the grounds that it aspired to \\"liquidate the Palestinian national project.\\" Thousands of Palestinian protesters held a \\"day of rage\\" in the Gaza Strip. On 1 February 2020, Reuters (Cairo) reported that President Trump requested to speak to Abbas by phone but Abbas said no, and that President Trump wanted to send him a letter...but Abbas refused it. The Palestinian Authority subsequently declared the cutting all ties with the United States and Israel including security relations, although this never took place. On 3 February 2020, lead Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said \\"What is left to negotiate? When I said these issues must be negotiated between us and Israel directly, Kushner responded by calling me a failed negotiator, unable to negotiate. He negotiated on my behalf because he knows better than I do what is best for me. This is the art of dictation, arrogance, and blackmail.\\"  Recognition criteria  The Trump plan sets forth criteria that Palestinians must meet before a Palestinian state is allowed to form. Whether Palestinians have met this criteria will be determined by Israel and the United States. If at any time Israel decides the Palestinians are not meeting the criteria, the Trump plan gives Israel the right to retake military control. According to US diplomat Ilan Goldenburg, this would allow Israel to determine when to end the occupation. The criteria are: > *The Palestinians shall have implemented a governing system with a > constitution or another system for establishing the rule of law that > provides for freedom of press, free and fair elections, respect for human > rights for its citizens, protections for religious freedom and for religious > minorities to observe their faith, uniform and fair enforcement of law and > contractual rights, due process under law, and an independent judiciary with > appropriate legal consequences and punishment established for violations of > the law. *The Palestinians shall have established transparent, independent, > and credit-worthy financial institutions capable of engaging in > international market transactions in the same manner as financial > institutions of western democracies with appropriate governance to prevent > corruption and ensure the proper use of such funds, and a legal system to > protect investments and to address market-based commercial expectations.

The plan called for land swaps, but dismissed the idea of \\"1-to-1 land swaps\\", arguing Palestinians would not receive 100 percent of pre-1967 territory, but provided for territory that would be \\"reasonably comparable\\" to pre-1967 territory. In exchange for Israel annexing parts of the West Bank, the plan raises the possibility of stripping the 350,000 Israeli Arab citizens of 10 towns in the Israel Triangle zone, such as Tayibe, Kafr Qasim and Qalansawe, of their Israeli citizenship by transferring their area to a future state of Palestine.Judy Maltz, At Risk of Losing Their Israeli Citizenship in ‚ÄòDeal of the Century,‚Äô These Arabs Are Feeling Betrayed,' Haaretz 2 February 2020 Palestinians would be given parts of the Negev Desert, connected through small land corridors to Gaza.Robin Wright, \\"Trump Unveils the 'Giveaway of the Century' on Middle East Peace The New Yorker January 29, 2020 The Trump plan gives Palestinians less territory than previous proposals. The plan recognizes an Israeli right to the entire Jordan Valley. Israel regards the valley as militarily strategic. Palestinians regard the valley as important for agriculture. The valley also allows Palestinians access to the River Jordan, which irrigates 80,000 hectares of agricultural land in the West Bank; giving Israel the valley would allow it to divert that water for its own use. According to Saree Makdisi, the plan would not allow Palestine to control its water resources. Within the West Bank, approximately 97% of Palestinians would be incorporated into contiguous Palestinian territory and 97% of Israelis into contiguous Israeli territory. On 3 February 2020, Trump plan raised the possibility that 11 Arab border towns, part of Israel's 21% Arab minority, become relocated [moved to] a future Palestinian state. Residents fear losing their ties to the land. When asked, David Friedman denied that Arab residents in Israel would lose citizenship. The implementation of the plan is conditional, being subject to the \\"Gaza Criteria\\" and would only proceed if the governance of the Gaza Strip, at present administered by Hamas, were transferred back either to the Palestinian Authority or another Palestinian entity Israel approves of.

Eldar strongly suspects that the impossibility of these tasks is a feature, not a bug, calling them ‚Äúpreventive measures to scuttle any U.S. initiative‚Äù toward peace.' According to these conditions, Hamas, the PIJ, and all other militias and organizations in Gaza which Israel classifies as \\"terrorist\\" would have to be disarmed. Gaza would be fully demilitarized. Hamas itself would be required to commit itself to making peace with the State of Israel by adopting the Quartet Principles, which include unambiguously and explicitly recognizing the State of Israel, committing to nonviolence, and accepting previous agreements and obligations between the parties. = Defense and border regime = The State of Palestine shall be fully demilitarized and remain as so. The State of Israel will be responsible for security at all international crossings into the State of Palestine. The State of Israel will continue to maintain control over the airspace and the electromagnetic spectrum, the Israeli Navy will have the right to block prohibited weapons and weapon-making materials from entering the State of Palestine. The State of Palestine will not have the right to forge intelligence or security agreements with any state or organization that adversely affect the State of Israel's security, as determined by the State of Israel. = Status of Jerusalem, Palestinian capital, and Holy sites= The plan affirms Israel has a right to the entirety of \\"undivided Jerusalem\\", recognizing it as Israel's capital. The plan does accept a Palestinian capital for a future State of Palestine to be located outside, and east and north of, the Israeli West Bank barrier, in that part of East Jerusalem encompassing Kafr 'Aqab, and the eastern refugee camp of Shuafat and Abu Dis.Michael Crowley, David M.

The plan puts the Haram al Sharif/Temple Mount, including Al-Aqsa mosque, under Israeli sovereignty. While in one part it states that the status quo there will be maintained, elsewhere it appears to envisage major changes to the status quo by permitting non-Muslims, Jews and Christians, to pray there. That would break with the status quo, one which Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed in 2015.Nir Hasson https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-trump-s-deal- offers-east-jerusalem-palestinians-a-grim-vision-of-the-future-1.8469393 'Trump‚Äôs Plan Calls for ‚ÄòSensitivity‚Äô in Jerusalem and then Takes a Hammer to It,‚Äô Haaretz 29 January 2020:‚ÄôFor example, the plan declares the status quo in the holy sites will be maintained: ‚ÄúIn particular the status quo at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif should continue uninterrupted.‚Äù But in the next paragraph it says: ‚ÄúPeople of every faith should be permitted to pray on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, in a manner that is fully respectful to their religion, taking into account the times of each religion‚Äôs prayers and holidays, as well as other religious factors.‚Äù 'Settlement Report [The Trump Plan Edition,']Foundation for Middle East Peace 31January 2020.

In the two decades that followed Israel's founding, some 800,000 Jews left the Arab world (300,000 in the very first few years), many as the result of hostilities and persecution; the majority of these immigrated to Israel.Goldberg, Harvey E., ed.

Columbia University Press, 2008, pp. 26-97 Some view the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries as analogous to the 1948 Palestinian exodus, emphasizing \\"push factors\\" like discrimination and violence, while other emphasize \\"pull factors\\" and consider them willing immigrants. = Economy = The plan proposes a $50 billion investment fund for 179 infrastructure and business projects, to be administered by a \\"multilateral development bank\\", with investments protected by \\"accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, and conditionality safeguards.\\" The administration envisions the plan being funded mostly by Arab states and wealthy private investors. Spending is divided into $26 billion in loans, $13.5 billion in grants, and $11 billion in private investment. The majority of the $50 billion would be spent in the West Bank and Gaza, with $9 billion to be spent in Egypt, $7 billion in Jordan, and $6.3 billion in Lebanon. The proposal includes a number of specific projects, including construction of a travel corridor that would cross Israel to link the West Bank and Gaza with a highway and possibly a rail line, vast expansion of border crossings, power plant upgrades, infrastructure improvements to boost tourism, career counseling and job placement service, re-building and modernizing Palestinian hospitals and health clinics, upgrading cargo terminals and building special access roads to reduce the time and costs of cross-border trade and travel, creation of a modern database to register land ownership, improving the potable water supply and waste water treatment, and establishing a new Palestinian university in the global top 150. The plan advocates a free market including greater protection of property rights and a \\"pro-growth tax structure\\". The plan's stated goals include creating more than a million jobs, more than doubling the Palestinian GDP, and cutting the poverty rate by 50%. It also aims to bring down the unemployment from 31% down to single digits, and to increase Palestinian exports as a percentage of GDP from 17% to 40%. The plan also aims to increase female labor force participation rate from 20% to 35%, reduce infant mortality from 18 to 9 per 1000 births, and increase average life expectancy from 74 to 80 years. = Anti-terrorism apparatus = The State of Palestine's security criteria has to be acceptable to the State of Israel; not (less) stringent than the metrics used by either Jordan or Egypt (whichever is stricter) with respect shall be obeyed. The State of Palestine's counterterrorism system must encompass all elements of counterterrorism. = Status of prisoners = Israel would undertake to release Palestinian prisoners and detainees held under administrative detention in Israeli prisons. The proposal states that all released prisoners would assume citizenship in a future State of Palestine. At the same time, Israel states that it would not release prisoners falling in any one of the following categories: # Those convicted of murder or attempted murder in Israeli courts. # Those convicted of conspiracy to commit murder (\\"terrorists\\"), according to Israeli courts. # Anyone classified under 1 and 2, who may happen to hold Israeli citizenship.

BBC News January 29, 2020 The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, stated the only plan he could accept was one that respected UN resolutions and international law.Oliver Holmes, 'Netanyahu backtracks on Israeli plan for swift Palestinian land grab,' The Guardian 5 February 2020 On 6 February, Kushner gave a closed doors briefing on the proposals to UNSC envoys and followed up with a briefing to journalists afterwards. Abbas attended the UN on 11 February to try to get support for a resolution being circulated condemning the proposed annexation; reportedly lacking votes, Abbas pulled the request. Any such resolution was nevertheless expected to attract a US veto. On February 10, Palestine withdrew their request for a vote. The United States had proposed a series of amendments to the draft resolution that could come for a vote at the session attended by Abbas. In proposals seen by AFP, the United States would significantly alter the text to remove references to 1967 lines being the basis of peace, cut out a line stating that Jewish settlements built in the West Bank since 1967 are illegal and eliminate language that equated East Jerusalem with the occupied West Bank. Haaretz confirmed that the plan would be discussed at the security council session (unusually being opened by the Secretary-General) and that there would be no vote on the draft resolution. The Palestinians have denied that the resolution has been withdrawn, that the draft resolution is still being circulated and discussed and that the resolution has not yet been put in \\"blue\\" (the final form for a vote). *After the security council meeting, the resolution remains in the pipeline according to Indonesia, one of its sponsors. Abbas' criticisms (he described the proposed state as \\"Swiss cheese\\") were echoed by most members of the Council while Abbas proposal for an international peace conference drew some support as many members seemed to agree that the parties should use this moment to restart negotiations but the next steps remain unclear. *At a Security Council held by videoconference on 30 March 2020, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov said that West Bank annexation would make it impossible to renew Israeli- Palestinian peace talks and would destroy any possibility of a two-state resolution to the conflict and dismissed any peace plan that does not comply with past international understandings that a two-state resolution to the conflict must be based on the pre-1967 lines. *Following the signing of a governing coalition agreement in Israel that includes a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, starting 1 July, Nickolay Mladenov, briefing the UNSC on 23 April, said that annexation would \\"constitute a serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations, and threaten efforts to advance regional peace.\\"  International reactions = Countries = * 's foreign ministry said in a statement \\"Bahrain supports all efforts toward achieving a just and comprehensive solution on the Palestinian issue,\\" and thanked the United States for its work. * 's Foreign ministry said that United Nations resolutions, the two-state solution, the principle of land for peace and other internationally backed measures form the basis for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. * 's Foreign Ministry issued a statement that Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the U.S. administration's initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights through the establishment of a sovereign independent state in the Palestinian occupied territories in accordance with international legitimacy and resolutions and that \\"Egypt calls on the two relevant parties to undertake a careful and thorough consideration of the U.S. vision to achieve peace and open channels of dialogue, under U.S. auspices, for the resumption of negotiations.\\" * 's Foreign Ministry initially said in a statement \\"France welcomes President Trump's efforts and will study closely the peace programme he has presented.\\" On 30 January, President Macron said \\"I believe in two sovereignties\\" when asked by Le Figaro newspaper whether he believed in two states and suggested the plan could struggle to get off the ground; he said \\"You need to be two to make peace.

On 3 March 2020, Jordan's Prime Minister said about the plan \\"Is the world willing to accept this? Do we realize where we're pushing Israel, Palestine, the region and the world?\\" and warned that Jordan's peace treaty with Israel was potentially at risk. * 's parliament had decided to boycott the Bahrain conference, the only Gulf state to do so. In response, Kuwait's Foreign Minister stated that \\"... we accept what our Palestinian brothers accept.\\" The Kuwaiti government appointed its first ambassador to Palestine shortly thereafter. After the announcement of the complete plan, the foreign ministry showed appreciation towards US efforts for peace, but added that a complete and fair solution is only possible if it follows international community terms and decisions, mainly \\"... an independent and sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 border with its capital in East Jerusalem.\\" * 's Foreign Ministry stated that Morocco \\"appreciates\\" the US plan, adding that acceptance by the parties is \\"fundamental to the implementation and sustainability of the plan\\". * 's Foreign Ministry stated that 'Qatar affirms its readiness to provide the required support for any endeavors within these foundations to resolve the Palestinian issue... peace cannot be sustainable unless the rights of the Palestinian people to establish an independent and sovereign state on the 1967 borders, including East Jerusalem, and to return to their lands are safeguarded.'\\"Factbox: U.S. Middle East peace plan prompts some praise, much Arab anger\\", Reuters January 28, 2020 * : In an initial official response, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised doubts about the plan noting \\"It's plain enough that some of this plan's provisions do not fully correspond to the relevant resolutions by the UN Security Council\\" and noting the opposition of the Palestinians and Arab states. * 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, \\"The Kingdom appreciate the efforts of President Trump's Administration to develop a comprehensive peace plan between the Palestinian and Israeli sides; and encourages the start of direct peace negotiation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, under the auspices of the United States.\\" King Salman has repeatedly stated Saudi Arabia will not support any settlement that fails to create an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.Martin Indyk, 'Disaster in the Desert: Why Trump's Middle East Plan Can't Work,' Foreign Policy November‚ÄìDecember 2019 * 's Foreign Ministry criticized the plan and said it was aimed at \\"stealing Palestinian lands\\". * : The ambassador issued a statement that the plan offers an important starting point for a return to negotiations within a U.S.-led international framework. * : Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab initially issued a statement cautiously welcoming the release of US proposals for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Subsequently, on 31 January, Raab, in response to talk of annexation, warned against any unilateral moves. = Supranational organizations = *: On 1 February, the Arab League issued a unanimous rejection of the plan. In a joint communique, officials from the 22 member states said the deal would not lead to a just peace between both sides, and the league would not cooperate with the US to implement it. According to Haaretz, an Arab diplomat explained that the United States did not disclose the full details of its Mideast peace plan to Arab states before its release, which is why representatives of three Arab countries attended the event unveiling it and \\"when they got into the minute details of the plan, we understood that there is no Palestinian state in practice and there is no capital in East Jerusalem, and more importantly, that there is an attempt to divide al-Aqsa Mosque\\" and \\"... so ultimately all the foreign ministers fell in line with the position opposing the Trump plan, and reiterated their commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative.\\" * : On 4 February 2020, Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission in a toughening of its initial response, said that the plan broke with \\"internationally agreed parameters\\" and \\"Steps towards annexation, if implemented, could not pass unchallenged.\\" Commenting \\"We can't not react to something [annexation] that, from our point of view, is against international law,\\" EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that the topic would be on the agenda of the next EU foreign affairs ministers' meeting in March, which would produce a common EU position on the subject. The Luxembourg foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, had hosted a private dinner on 16 February with eight other EU foreign ministers from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Malta, Spain, Slovenia, and Sweden on the subject. Portugal also sent its secretary of state to the event.  Other reactions  On 3 February 2020, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, rejected the plan and \\"calls on all member states not to engage with this plan or to cooperate with the U.S. administration in implementing it in any form.\\" According to Christianity Today, the reaction in the Christian world was mixed. The plan was criticised by many Middle Eastern Christians, including by Christians at Nazareth Evangelical College, Gaza Baptist Church, Presbyterian Church of Aleppo and the Arab Baptist Theological Seminary in Beirut. The plan was praised by Christians at Christians United for Israel and Beeson Divinity School in Alabama. The reaction among American Jewish groups was mixed: J Street criticised the plan while AIPAC praised it. A number of conditions (see: ¬ß Recognition Criteria) have been denounced as unachievable. On 23 February 2020, Pope Francis said at a meeting of bishops from all countries in the Mediterranean basin \\"Nor can we overlook the still unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, with the danger of inequitable solutions and, hence, a prelude to new crises.\\" In an open letter published by the Guardian, fifty former European prime ministers and foreign ministers condemned the plan, saying it would create an apartheid-like situation in occupied Palestinian territory. According to Nathan Thrall, Middle East analyst for the International Crisis Group, both Clinton's and the subsequent Trump plan confine a Palestinian majority to an area less than a quarter of Mandate Palestine. For Rashid Khalidi, rather than being a new deal for the 21st century, Trump's plan follows a much older colonial pattern set long ago by Great Britain and pursued by the United States.Rashid Khalidi, \\"President Trump's Peace Plan Is the Latest in a Century of Outrageous Deals for the Palestinians\\", Time, January 31, 2020. 'The \\"Deal of the Century\\" as Trump described it, is in fact a typical colonial concoction: put together by those who believe that they know better than the benighted natives do what is best for them, and elevating the rights and interests of one group over those of another. This pattern, set by Great Britain and the early Zionist movement, has been followed by the U.S. and Israel ever since then.... While far more extreme and one-sided than anything that preceded it, this new plan also constitutes a continuation of a much older pattern. The Palestinians, the overwhelming majority of the population of Palestine at the time, were not even mentioned in the Balfour Declaration, whose terms governed their lives for three decades. Nor were they mentioned in UNSC 242, the supposed basis for \\"peace-making\\" in the Middle East, which not surprisingly has signally failed to bring peace to Palestine/Israel in over half a century.

History Citigroup previously controlled the site dating back to the 1980s, having taken ownership of it during the development of One Court Square and the smaller Two Court Square. While planned as the future site of another office tower for Citi, by 2015 the company decided it didn't need the potential space and that the value of the land was higher as a development site. As a result, Citi hired JLL to market the site and several months later sold the parcel to Flushing, Queens-based developer Chris Xu for $143 million. In February 2016, permits were initially filed for a 79-story tower that would reach a height of . However, due to Long Island City's proximity to LaGuardia Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration ruled that the building could rise no higher than without posing a threat to landing airplanes. As a result, the development was downsized to its current height of . In September 2016, Bank of China provided a $100 million loan to refinance the development site. Foundation work at the site began in late 2017. In July 2018, the developers secured $502 million in financing from a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase, the largest-ever financing for a private real estate development in Queens. By the end of 2018, foundation work was complete and the building had risen to the sixth floor. The project launched sales in May 2019, targeting a sellout of over $1 billion, a record for Queens. The building topped-out in October 2019. Architecture and design Upon completion, the tower will contain 802 condos spread across the building's 68 floors. Rather than target traditional buyers of luxury Manhattan condominiums, the development hopes to attract buyers looking for more space at a lower price point and willing to accept an outer borough location. As such, the units range in price from $500,000 to $4 million, significantly lower than comparable units in Manhattan. Amenities include a fitness center with a swimming pool, a sauna and spa, a yoga room, laundry room, a children‚Äôs playroom, and multiple lounges for residents. The developers have also committed $16 million to constructing a new entrance to the New York City Subway's neighboring Court Square‚Äì23rd Street station in the base of the building.

It measures 171.1 x 105.8 cm (69 x 43 in.) and is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The painting was directly inspired by a meeting between the artist and a street singer one night. Manet asked her to pose for him but she refused, so Manet asked a favorite model, Victorine Meurent, to pose for the work. The Street Singer is either the first or second of Manet's several large-scale paintings for which Meurent posed.Mauner, G. L., & Loyrette, H. (2000). Manet: The Still-life Paintings. New York: H.N. Abrams in association with the American Federation of Arts. p. 17. .Manet, √âdouard, Mary Anne Stevens, and Lawrence W. Nichols (2012). Manet: Portraying Life. Toledo: Toledo Museum of Art. p. 197. It depicts an itinerant singer in fashionable dress leaving a cabaret by night, clutching a guitar and eating cherries. The style of the painting shows the influence of Frans Hals and Spanish masters such as Diego Vel√°zquez. The Street Singer is one of a series of single-figure compositions Manet painted during the 1860s in which he depicted contemporary \\"types\\" at life size, upsetting the convention that such humble genre subjects be painted at a small scale. The art historian George Mauner says the woman's confrontational stare and her awkward grasp of the cherries and the guitar, \\"which seems almost too bulky for her to manage comfortably\\", produces a self-conscious effect that is unexpecting in a genre painting. The painting was donated to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1966.

The open door is taken from Vel√°zquez's Las Meninas. The child in the right foreground is the 7- or 8-year old L√©on Ko√´lla-Leenhoff, who also appeared in Manet's similarly Spanish-influenced Boy Carrying a Sword. Spanish Cavaliers was first exhibited as work 6 in the autumn Salon of 1905. Manet's family sold the work directly to the art collector Cheramy. It was later bought by Raymond Tripier, a Lyon doctor who left it to its present owner in 1917. The Wildenstein catalogues also mention the art dealer Paul Guillaume as one of the work's other owners, though this is unlikely since Guillaume was born in 1891.

Biography Velimir Rajiƒá was born at Aleksinac on the 20th of January 1879. He finished elementary school, gymnasium and philosophical faculty in Belgrade. For some time he worked as a teacher at the Belgrade Gymnasium, and after that as an official at the National Library.–ú–∏–ª–æ–º–∏—Ä –ì–ª–∏—à–∏—õ, –î—É—à–∞–Ω –ò–ª–∏—õ, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∏—õ, –†–∞–¥–º–∏–ª–æ –õ–∞–ª–µ –ú–∞–Ω–¥–∏—õ, –ú–∏—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –õ–∞—Ñ –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ, –ú–∏–æ–¥—Ä–∞–≥ –†–∏—Å—Ç–∏—õ: –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ü, —Ç—Ä–µ—õ–µ –¥–æ–ø—É—ö–µ–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—ö–µ.

For Velimir Rajiƒá the war years (1912, 1913, 1914, and 1915) were particularly painful. Ill health followed him from his earliest days, though tragic was his sudden death at Gornji Milanovac when the Serbian Army was preparing to retreat in 1915. But it was no surprise to those that knew how he suffered. In their wake soldiers and refugees left innumerable bodies, each one evidence of a human tragedy and mental suffering: \\"Rajiƒá died of a broken heart,\\" wrote dramatist Branislav Nu≈°iƒá, who was himself an eyewitness to the dramatic struggles before the Great Retreat.Losing all hope was another writer Milutin Uskokoviƒá who took his life by drowning. Also, Milutin Bojiƒá died in a Salonika hospital of consumption after experiencing the retreat over the Albanian mountains while Vladislav Petkoviƒá Dis, perished at sea when a German torpedo struck his transport ship. In 1908, Velimir Rajiƒá was reproached by literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá for \\"the too dark, morbid, and almost clinical\\" tone of his poetry, but he did not deny him as an excellent poet. Skerliƒá did not realize that Rajiƒá had a short time to live, plagued by ill health since childhood, now compounded with the ravages of war. Velimir Rajiƒá's first volume of verse -- Pesme i proza/Poems and Prose -- is full of local colour and bold enjambement recalling all his harrowing experiences but, as the enfant terrible of the realists, Rajiƒá had a sense of fun and wit which prevented him from taking himself or the pontificating Skerliƒá too seriously. His passion for his girlfriend Kosara Babiƒá and their final parting (she married Gli≈°a Elezoviƒá) reveal, however, a very different Rajiƒá in Dan Tvog Venƒçanja (On the day of your wedding). When, however, he fell in love and his love failed him, the essential duality of his nature shows itself. It is significant that Dan Tvog Venƒçanja (The day of your wedding) which sprang from heartbreaking experience are in dialogue form. His poems today are set to music and song. In 1911 Vladimir Rajiƒá led the special festive program commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. The program opened with a Prologue written by poet Rajiƒá in the dramatic style of a tableau vivant commemorating the moment of the groundbreaking ceremony which took place in 1861. The work of Rajiƒá can be divided into two main parts, the first represented by his early poems, many of which were published shortly before the turn of the new century and the second comprising his later works, which were the poems he was preparing to publish at the moment of his untimely death. While sick in a military hospital, he contracted typhus, and died in 1915.

The style is found in government edifices, commercial projects, and residential buildings in all five boroughs. The architecture of the period was influenced not just by decorative arts influences from across the world, but also local zoning regulations. Their proliferation fueled by the Roaring Twenties and commercial speculation, Art Deco buildings in the city range in size and sophistication from towering skyscrapers and office buildings to modest middle-class housing and municipal buildings. First defined by the colorful, lavishly-decorated skyscrapers of Manhattan, the Great Depression and changing tastes pushed Art Deco to more subdued applications in the 1930s. The lull in construction during World War II and rise of the International Style led to the end of new Art Deco in the city. After falling out of favor and suffering from neglect during the city's downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, New York's Art Deco has been reappraised; among its most treasured and recognizable buildings are the Art Deco Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, and Art Deco skyscrapers formed the core of the city's skyline. Today, many of New York's Art Deco buildings are protected by historic preservation laws, while others have been lost to development or neglect. Introduction One of architect and illustrator alt= American Art Deco has its origins in European arts, especially the style moderne popularized at the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts from which Art Deco draws its name (Exposition internationale des arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes). While the United States would not officially participate, Americans‚Äîincluding New York City architect Irwin Chanin‚Äîvisited the exposition, and the government sent a delegation to the expo. Their resulting reports helped spread the style to America. Other influences included German expressionism, the Austrian Secession, art nouveau, cubism, and the ornament of African and Central and South American cultures. In America, Art Deco architecture would take on different forms in different regions of the country, influenced by local culture, laws, and tastes. Art Deco came into style just as New York itself was being rapidly transformed. An exploding population, flush economic times, cheap credit, and lax zoning combined to encourage a building boom. The real estate market was so frenetic that old buildings were regularly torn down for new construction after standing for only a few years. Builders tore down twice as many buildings as went up, with the new buildings occupying two or more old lots. The result was that the amount of office space in New York City increased by 92% in the back half of the 1920s. In New York City specifically, zoning regulations had major impacts on the design of its buildings. The development of the elevator and steel-framed buildings enabled the construction of buildings far taller than ever before‚Äîthe skyscraper. The rise of ever-larger skyscrapers such as the 40-story Equitable Building helped spur the passage of the United States' first citywide zoning code, the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The regulations, intended to prevent tall buildings from choking out light and air at street level, required tall buildings to \\"set back\\" from street level depending on the width of the street and the zoned area. Once a building rose up and set back to cover just 25% of the lot, clients and architects were limited not by city codes but by money and engineering as to the height of their project. The impact of the new regulations was not felt until later in the decade, as the entry of the United States into World War I slowed construction. Early buildings built to conform to the new setback codes did so unimaginatively‚Äîthe Heckscher Building in Midtown (completed 1921) set back evenly like a stack of boxes as it rose‚Äîbut more novel interpretations of the law would follow. A major influence on the resulting skyscrapers was Finn Eliel Saarinen's second- place entry for Chicago's Tribune Tower, considered a liberating alternative for a skyscraper style unbeholden to either Gothic or Classical architecture. Also influential were architect and illustrator Hugh Ferriss' series of speculative architectural illustrations exploring how to make buildings that met the zoning requirements. Ferriss' illustrations envisioned buildings as sculptural forms rather than simple boxes. Architect Talbot Hamlin described Ferriss' work as \\"a magic wand to set the American city architecture free from its nightmare [...] No longer was the high building apparently built by the mile and cut off to order, but it was composed break upon break, buttress on buttress. The possibilities of poetry entered in.\\" Precursors to the Art Deco skyscrapers that would soon go up across the city were buildings such as Raymond Hood's American Radiator Building, which was neo-Gothic in general style but featured abstract ornament that would characterize Art Deco. Another early transitional building was the Madison Belmont Building at 181 Madison Avenue (1924‚Äì1925), which featured traditional ornamentation and organization on upper floors, combined with Art Deco motifs on the lower floors. The ironwork was provided by Edgar Brandt, who contributed the entrance gates to the 1925 Paris Exhibition. Art Deco in the city =Vertical style= The buildings that would become described as Art Deco shared several elements. The setback laws resulted in three-dimensional, sculptural buildings, with long, uninterrupted piers rising between columns of windows and decorated spandrels. These choices were made to emphasize the height of the buildings as an overriding consideration, a choice mimicked even on much shorter buildings built across town. New York's architects were at the forefront of using new materials, including synthetics like Bakelite and Formica plastics, as well as Nirosta, a corrosion-resistant steel alloy that made exterior metal on skyscrapers more feasible. Aluminum's declining price and lighter weight than steel led to it being a common choice for interior and exterior usage. Other favored materials were brick and multicolored terra cotta. Architectural historian Rosemarie Haag Bletter described the most pronounced element of Art Deco as \\"its use of sumptuous ornament\\". The most dynamic elements were reserved for entrances and at the tops of buildings, with multiple materials combined to form dazzling colors or rich texture. Sometimes the buildings were shaded‚Äîusing darker-colored materials at the base, and then gradually lightening towards the top‚Äîto increase the building's visibility. Art Deco buildings in the city were also richly appointed inside and out with reliefs, mosaics, murals, and other art. Allegorical depictions‚Äîsuch as beehives of industry on the French Building, personifications of virtues at Rockefeller Center, or figures portraying industry and the arts at the International Magazine Building‚Äîwere common decorative elements. The entries and lobbies of these skyscrapers often drew direct influence from the painted sets and stages of theaters, with framing like hanging curtains. Architect Ely Jacques Kahn commented in 1926 on the emerging style that his brethren were creating with their buildings: > [It] is so characteristic of New York that it would be more logical, by far, > to call it a New York Style. [...] Decoration becomes a far more precious > thing than a collection of dead leaves, swags, bull's heads and cartouches. > It becomes a means of enriching the surface with a play of light and shade, > voices and solids. [Today's ornamental forms] respond to the bulk and > simplicity of the skyscraper itself. Deco in New York became intrinsically linked with commercial architecture. Its focus on rich ornamentation and sensory appeal appealed to commercial patrons who wanted an \\"acceptable\\" modern style. These developers in turn gave architects a permissive mandate to create in the style, as long as the end result was not too shocking. The buildings rose to the height where the cost of added space equalized with the commercial value of that space. The emerging style was contemporaneously called the \\"vertical style\\", \\"skyscraper style\\", or simply \\"modern\\", with the characteristic look of setback buildings leading to them being called \\"wedding cake\\" buildings. Detail from an entrance to 70 Pine Street, featuring aluminum spandrels with geometric ornamentation and a miniature limestone model of the building itself. The demand for modern buildings was such that even architectural firms known for more restrained and classical designs adopted the new style. Cross & Cross's main practice was for discreet townhomes and banks, but in the late 1920s they produced modern skyscrapers such as the RCA Victor Building. The 50-story skyscraper turned Gothic tracery into stylized lightning bolts. Another conservative firm that moved to modernistic designs was Walker & Gillette, whose best-known Art Deco building in New York is the Fuller Building. Buildings already being constructed were sometimes appended with Art Deco flourishes; the Paramount Building (1926) had an Art Deco clock tower appended to a Beaux-Arts base. These buildings were constructed either as headquarters for established and emerging companies, or else speculative projects where money would be drawn from renting out the space in the new building. The design of speculative buildings was chiefly driven by maximizing rentable space, whereas corporate buildings served as advertisements for the corporations themselves‚Äîin some cases, sacrificing revenue for what architect Timothy L. Pflueger termed \\"special architectural appeal\\". Even with these corporate buildings, however, the owners would often lend space to smaller businesses and treat them as real estate investments. The very buildings often spoke to the business conducted there. The RCA Building's wave motifs represent the power of radio, while the Chrysler Building would have ornamental touches of radiators and hubcaps for the automobile company. With the McGraw-Hill Building, Wyndham New Yorker Hotel, and Daily News Building, the buildings feature their names in prominent signage or embedded into the very facade. Because the true shape of the building was often hard to grasp for a street-level observer, many of the skyscrapers featured miniature versions of the building itself as part of their ground-level decoration. In the Financial District and downtown Manhattan, the skyline was quickly transformed by the proliferation of Art Deco high-rises. Arguably the first Art Deco skyscraper was the Barclay-Vesey Building at 140 West Street, built from 1923 to 1927 and conceived by Ralph Thomas Walker. Its exterior was decorated with motifs derived from Aztec designs, and the lobby featured a vaulting ceiling with frescoes detailing the history of communication. Other notable Art Deco skyscrapers in downtown include the Irving Trust Company Building (1929‚Äì1931), designed with a \\"curtain\\" exterior and Hildreth Meiere-produced mosaics in the interior; 120 Wall Street (1929‚Äì1930), with classic wedding-cake form and a red granite and limestone base; and the City Bank-Farmers Trust Building, featuring abstract heads along the facade looking down at street level, and bronzed doors featuring transportation methods. The final skyscraper built before World War II in the Financial District was 70 Pine Street, built 1932. It featured unique double-deck elevators servicing two lobby floors, designed to maximize the profitable space of the small plot. In comparison to downtown, which already had skyscrapers dating to the previous century and fewer available plots, Midtown Manhattan was only just beginning to develop its skyline as Art Deco became popular, with its business district booming after the construction of Grand Central Terminal and the undergrounding of previously exposed train tracks opening up new plots for development. 42nd Street became Midtown's major Art Deco thoroughfare, hosting some of the city's most famous skyscrapers. New York's architects were caught in a furious race for the title of tallest building in the world, and several Art Deco buildings vied for the title. By the end of 1930 there were more than 11 building plans on file of more than 60 floors; among them were the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, both of which increased in height from their 1928 and 1929 plans, respectively. In competition with 40 Wall Street for the title of tallest building, Van Alen secretly constructed the Chrysler Building's steel spire within the building itself, hoisting it and securing it into position in a single day, claiming the title of tallest building. The triumph was short- lived; a month later Al Smith updated the plans for the Empire State Building, adding more stories and a 200-foot spire of its own so that dirigibles could moor there. The Chrysler Building would remain the tallest building in the world for just eleven months before being overtaken by the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building towers above the New York skyline in 1937. The many unoccupied and unlit floors of the building can be seen; the building would not be profitable until after World War II. The Chrysler Building's spire went up just one day before the October 1929 Wall Street Crash that triggered the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. The immediate impact of the Depression was a sharp contraction in building of all kinds; one architectural firm went from 17 filed plans for buildings up to 30 stories in 1929 to just three plans in 1930, the tallest being four stories. The scope of some existing construction was also downsized; the Metropolitan Life Company intended to capture the title for tallest building with the Metropolitan Life North Building, but construction stopped during the downturn and never resumed, leaving it an \\"enormous stump\\" of 31 stories instead of the planned hundred. In the shadow of the deepening Depression, the Metropolitan Opera abandoned its plans to move to a new three-block complex financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Rockefeller decided to proceed with the project, hiring three different architectural firms, including Hood and Harvey Wiley Corbett, who would leave the project to work on the ill-fated Metropolitan Life North Building. The architects envisioned a plan for buildings arranged on several axes, clad in the same materials, windows grouped in vertical columns, and grand entrances. At the center was 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The buildings on the wings of the grand entrance were occupied by foreign governments (French, British, and Italian), who decided on the ornamentation for the building. The Rockefellers earmarked $150,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) for art in the plaza alone, filling the space with paintings, reliefs, and sculptural forms. The decorative features focus on the achievements of humankind, mythology, and stories of education and commerce. =Commercial= The heyday of Art Deco skyscrapers was effectively ended by the Great Depression, but Art Deco had proliferated outwards across the city in myriad forms. Art Deco proved a popular style for an expanding range of modern commercial edifices that proliferated during the period‚Äîdepartment stores, news offices, and transportation. The initial prevailing wisdom was that the real estate market would quickly recover as the stock market had drained capital from construction. To tide landowners over until economic conditions improved, many built \\"taxpayers\\" on their lots‚Äîsingle or two-story buildings. Despite being intended as temporary, many of these buildings remained for decades afterwards. One such Art Deco taxpayer was the East River Savings Bank on 22 Cortlandt Street, which replaced a fifteen-story building from the 1890s. The New York Times dubbed the lot \\"the most valuable piece of New York real estate for a tax payer in the city.\\" Despite being a more modest building, the structure is appointed with polished stone eagles, interior marble, and at one time featured a mural of the East River. Completed speculative buildings faced issues in the difficult economy‚Äîthe Empire State Building took more in as a tourist attraction than from tenants, and office buildings across Midtown felt pinched by the Rockefeller Center's aggressive tactics to lure and keep tenants. As the 1930s progressed, the rental market began to improve, and the pace of construction increased. The buildings that went up in this period tended to be more reserved, with grayer, more austere versions of Art Deco; Bletter suggests that this change was due to the lush, colorful look of the earlier style appearing \\"frivolous\\" in the 1930s and the influence of mechanization. Terra cotta decoration was replaced with smoother, rounded surfaces, and metal-clad streamlining influenced by vehicular designs. Art Deco was a popular choice for the movie theaters and stages being built at the time, and apropos choice given that Art Deco itself found influence in design from films, from the German Expressionist films such as Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Deco theaters in the city included the Ziegfeld Theater, an explicit example of the building-as-set designs with the facade including a proscenium to mirror the one indoors. The rise of the Empire State and new Deco buildings along Fifth Avenue corresponded with its transformation from a \\"millionaire's mile\\" of wealthy residences to middle-class commercial business. Tiffany & Co.'s flagship store at 749 Fifth Avenue, built 1940, was designed to feature luxurious amenities including central air conditioning. The old Waldorf Astoria hotel had been demolished to make way for the Empire State Building, and the new building for the hotel drew heavy influence from it. Costing $42 million, architects Schultz & Weaver designed twin limestone and brick towers, and included a suite for the President and a private rail line from Grand Central. =Residential= Alongside the commercial boom of the 1920s, New York experienced a huge increase in residential construction; 20% of all new housing built in the United States in the 1920s was built in New York. Apartment buildings grew from 39% of construction in 1919 to 77% in 1926. The Art Deco era paralleled New Yorkers' shift away from tenement-style housing (multifamily homes with shared facilities) and row houses towards apartment buildings (single-family rooms with separate bathrooms). In the 1920s, developers began building apartments targeting the middle class. Urban Art Deco was a way of appealing to prospective renters and keep them in the city, rather than the suburbs. The growth of the subway drove new Art Deco architecture as well. Developers built new speculative housing in the undeveloped areas the new subway lines reached, with the end result being a decentralization of New York's population. While the total number of persons in the city grew 45 percent between 1910 and 1930, Manhattan's population density and total population decreased in the same period. The great majority of these apartments throughout the boroughs topped out at six stories, because building seven stories or taller required more expensive fireproof materials. In Manhattan, Art Deco apartments sprouted up across the borough. Some of the first apartment buildings to receive influence from the Art Deco office buildings and skyscrapers downtown were the sister buildings The Majestic and The Century. Together with The Eldorado, these twin-towered apartments transformed Central Park West's skyline. Emery Roth was responsible for three of the large apartments in this section of town. The downturn in the housing market of the 1930s encouraged New Dealers to focus on nonprofit and limited- profit housing to renew blighted parts of the city or expand beyond its current limits. Examples of these limited-profit housing initiatives can be found throughout the boroughs, especially in Sunnyside, Queens. To save money, the middle-class Art Deco often used \\"cast stone\\" (i.e. concrete) instead of expensive stone, reusing molds to repeat designs and shapes. Compared to the architects of Manhattan, many of the architects of the Deco in the outer boroughs were not well-known, and some were forgotten in a generation. While the famous architects of skyscrapers often studied at the Beaux-Arts school, the often-Jewish architects of places like the Grand Concourse and Ocean Ave studied at local art schools. The densest concentration of Art Deco buildings in New York is in the west Bronx centered along the Grand Concourse, with roughly 300 buildings constructed between 1935 and 1941. One of the first, and grandest, Art Deco apartments along the Concourse was the Park Plaza Apartments, completed 1931. Intended to rise ten stories before being damaged by fire during construction, the final building is eight stories and decorated with bright polychromatic terra cotta. Park Plaza was the first Bronx Deco apartments by Horace Ginsberg & Associates, who would help change the face of the borough. These buildings featured Deco hallmarks of geometric patterns and colored brick, with indirectly-lit public interiors floored with tile, framed with metal, and capped by mosaic ceilings. Private interiors featured sunken living rooms, wrap-around windows in the corners, and ample closet space; inside and out these apartments were designed to appeal to the fashion- conscious, \\"new money\\" middle class. =Religious structures= Few religious buildings in the Art Deco style were built in New York City. The Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Luke's Lutheran Church have Art Deco elements to their more traditional, Neo-gothic elements. In Washington Heights, the Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist (now a synagogue) is a rare example of Christian Science Art Deco anywhere in the country. In Queens, the Rego Park Synagogue provides a late example of an Art Deco synagogue. =Schools= The first modern school in the city was Public School 98 in the Bronx, one of the first new schools built under a program to establish a separate junior high school program in the city. =Public works= The entranceway to the Brooklyn Public Library The pace of public works spending increased after World War I, and especially during the Depression. Throughout the 1920s, New York's breakneck growth was largely unconstrained and unguided by government policy; no master blueprint for the city's future existed. Corruption scandals forced Mayor Jimmy Walker from office in 1932, and Fiorello H. La Guardia assumed the office. La Guardia saw the Depression as an opportunity to remake the city, and spearheaded a bevy of public works projects. La Guardia was a fervent New Dealer, and the city benefited greatly from Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal Works Progress Administration program, established to provide relief. In 1935 and 1936, the city alone received one-seventh of all WPA funds. The money went to projects such as a network of public pools across the city, with Crotona Park in the Bronx and Tompkinsville Pool in Staten Island being built with Art Deco flourishes. Art Deco's influence affected many aspects of New York's public works during this period; by the late 1930s, most Art Deco buildings were municipal projects, not commercial ones. The Health Building at 125 Worth Street c. 1932‚Äì1935 has metal grillwork and health-related designs around the entrances, designed by German craftsman Oscar Bruno Bach, who produced custom metalwork for the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. Other Art Deco sanitation buildings include the Tallman Island Water Pollution Control Plant in Queens and the Manhattan Grit Chamber in East Harlem. Other major Art Deco projects included the New York Municipal Airport, of which Marine Air Terminal remains, and the ventilation tunnels and portals of the Lincoln Tunnel, which opened in 1937 and connect New Jersey and Manhattan. Legacy and preservation In 1932, the Museum of Modern Art exhibited a modern architecture show that would introduce the International Style to New Yorkers; museum director Alfred H. Barr Jr. was dismissive of the Art Deco style and tastes of \\"low\\", commercial interests. Where Art Deco maintained links to classicism and favored ornamentation, International Style favored undecorated facades; Bletter summed up the difference between the ethos of International Style as \\"less is more\\", and Art Deco as \\"more than enough.\\" While the International Style's impact was blunted by the Depression, it became popular after World War II. International Style buildings, with their emphasis on airy glass and the horizontal were now modern and exciting, while Deco was outmoded and linked to the Depression-era privations. In comparison to the International Style, Art Deco's role as the first international style, and its importance, were largely forgotten. Art Deco was formally named and categorized as a style in the 1960s and reappraised. Writing in 1975, Cervin Robinson noted that by the standard of direct stylistic influence, Art Deco had virtually no impact‚Äîbut by its impact on the character of New York itself, Art Deco \\"helped crystallize our image of Gotham.\\" The decline in New York City's fortunes in the 1960s and 1970s caused the damage and loss of many Art Deco buildings. The Noonan Plaza Apartments on the Grand Concourse suffered from heavy vandalism, with skylights ripped from frames to sell for scrap metal. It was eventually restored thanks to the efforts of Ginsberg's son and a new owner. The modern historical preservation movement in New York City was sparked by the loss of Old Penn Station, leading to the establishment of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Commission is the largest municipal preservation organization in the United States. Some of the first Art Deco buildings so protected were the Chrysler Building and Chanin Building in 1978. Radio City Music Hall's interiors were landmarked the same year after a contentious battle with the Music Hall's owners, who wished to demolish it; the Commission received more than 100,000 signatures urging the landmark status. Some Art Deco buildings were demolished before they were eligible for protection, such as the 12-story Bonwit Teller building at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street.Donald Trump demolished the building in 1980, with the limestone reliefs Trump had promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art instead jackhammered and destroyed. To avoid landmark status, landowners will sometimes rush to demolish the building or deface the facade. Today, groups such as the Art Deco Society of New York (ADSNY) produce talks and tours about the city's architecture. New York City Landmarks Commission veteran Anthony W. Robins wrote that decades after the rise and fall of Art Deco, the style \\"survives and flourishes\\" in New York, with the once-daring buildings having become historic landmarks of the city.

These cells are notable for their high levels of vanadium (concentrations 107 higher than that of seawater), which is typically a metabolic poison in other contexts. Structure and description Vanadocytes are specialized blood cells found in marine tunicates. These cells are 8-13 um in size and the cytoplasm contains many acidic globules, termed \\"vanadophores\\". These cells are one of several types found in the ascidian circulatory system and are abundant in the blood. The cells are described as highly distinctive, with little variation between species. They have a circular outline that decays into a rosette form upon desiccation, with several inclusions that almost entirely fill the cell. The cell has a greenish color, varying from dark apple to scarcely perceptible, due to their vanadium complexes. These green cells are not, as was initially believed, symbiotic zooxanthellae, although ascidians are known to have such symbiotes elsewhere. Chemistry Vanadocytes are of interest to biologists and chemists because they contain high levels of vanadium and vacuole of sulfuric acid with acid mass fraction as high as 9 wt%, both of which are typically toxic to living creatures. Additionally, the vanadium complex itself is unstable, found almost exclusively in the air-oxidizable, +3 oxidation state. Function The function of vanadocytes is still unclear. It has been proposed that the vanadocyte transports and processes nutrients, contributes to the polysaccharide external tunic, or serves as a defense mechanism. It is unlikely that the vanadium complex serves as an oxygen transport mechanism because it is unable to reversibly bind oxygen. Research into their utility as anti-biofouling (allelopathic) mechanisms concluded that the high acidity and high vanadium levels function to significantly reduce epizoic recruitment and predation.

Retrieved 24 Jun 2019 or Little Lots is a patience game and one of the most popular and widespread card games in the world. Its origins are unclear, but it bears some similarity with the classic Asian game of Mahjong.  Cards  A 32-card Piquet or Skat pack is used.  Rules  The following rules are based on those at the Alle Karten Spiele website. The pack is dealt to eight piles, each of four cards. The bottom three cards are face down, the top one is flipped. The aim of the game is to remove all eight packets of cards to a wastepile by following the rules. Two cards of the same rank may always be removed. For example, if there are two Kings among the eight upcards, they are removed to the wastepile and two cards under them are turned over. A lower (face down) card may not be looked at until the upcard above it has been removed, with one exception. If three of the upcards are of the same rank, e.g. three Obers, the three cards below them may be viewed to decide which two of these three Kings to remove from the game. The patience is out when all eight packets have been removed from the game. However, the game is lost if there are no visible pairs at any stage. Since the outcome depends a lot on chance, Eight-Pack Patience is one of the harder patiences to get out.  Footnotes   References   Literature  * Morehead, Albert and Geoffrey Mott-Smith (2001).

History Ice Rink Pin√© The construction of the ice rink began in 1984 and was completed the following year. The official opening took place in January 1986 during an international ice speed skating competition. The Pin√© ice rink hosted the speed skating and curling competitions of the XXVI Winter Universiade of Trentino 2013 and the Junior Speed Skating World Championships in February 2019. Among the local skaters who grew up on the Pin√© oval are Roberto Sighel (first Italian winner of a world title) and Matteo Anesi (gold medal in team pursuit at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin). The facility will host the XXV Winter Olympics of Milano-Cortina d'Ampezzo 2026. To this end, the oval will be subject to a radical redevelopment that will lead to the construction of a total coverage of the oval, with capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 spectators (3,000 people on the permanent stands and 2,000 people on the grandstands temponranee). The works, which will start in June 2021 and will end in October 2024, have an estimated cost of about 36.000.000 USD. Located on the Pin√© plateau at an altitude of 1030 m above sea level, it will be the highest oval in Europe, giving Olympic athletes the opportunity to conquer new records of speed on ice. Characteristics The facility has an ice speed skating rink, known as Miola di Pin√© Oval, made of concrete with artificial refrigeration system (which can therefore be used both in winter and in summer with roller skates), consisting of two 113.58 metre long straight lines, connected by two 180¬∞ curves, and a total linear length of 400 metres.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades and Cascade Range. The mountain is situated less than south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, on the east side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Andrew Peak, to the east-southeast. The Pacific Northwest Trail traverses the slopes of Sheep Mountain as it crosses Peeve Pass. Precipitation runoff from Sheep Mountain drains west into Peeve Creek, or east into tributaries of Ashnola River. The mountain was so named because for 40 years the meadows surrounding it were prime grazing land for sheep in the summer, before the protection of wilderness designation. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

From about 1993 it was recreated from some stock kept by Amish people in the United States. A breed association, Het Vlaams Paard, was formed in 1999.

A noted authority on medieval women, she published several articles on childhood, education, employment, sexuality, and the repopulation of the Kingdom of Granada, which led to changes in the field and a new vision of women's work in late medieval cities. She was a founding member and a director of the UMA's Association of Women's Studies, established in 1985. In addition, she taught courses in Zaragoza, Ja√©n, C√°diz, and Argentina. Her studies were not only based on the fields of women and sexuality; she also explored the areas of the New Christians and of commerce.

In 2012 she was diagnosed with breast cancer, ‚Äúrelatively early, stage IIB, during a routine mammogram screening‚Äù which she said many lesbians don't get due to heteronormativity and homophobia, that after treatments and surgery went into remission. At a memorial, Urvashi Vaid, who formerly led the National LGBTQ Task Force, talked about ‚Äúthe Breasties,‚Äù a breast cancer support group, ‚ÄúWe hated the color pink and loved saying ‚Äòfuck cancer.‚Äô‚Äù From her experience with breast cancer and talking with other lesbians who avoided healthcare for the same bias against them concerns, she became a ‚Äúfierce breast cancer screening advocate‚Äú.

He is known for wearing political protest signs on a sandwich board. Biography Lim moved to Australia in 1963, where he began work as an electrical technician. Political career =Local government (2008-2012)= In 2008, Lim was elected to the Strathfield Council as the lead candidate for an independent ticket, which received 13% of the vote. Lim ran on the policy of \\"openness, transparency, accountability and morality\\" in the council, and refused to get paid for his time in office. =State and Federal campaigns= During the 2016 Federal election, Lim ran for the Australian Senate and received 0.01% of the vote in New South Wales. He also ran as an Independent for the Legislative Council in the 2019 New South Wales election, gaining 644 votes (0.01%). Controversies =Swearing court case= In 2015, Lim was fined $500 for offensive conduct after publicly wearing a sign which labelled the incumbent Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott a 'CVNT'. A GoFundMe campaign by supporters raised enough money to cover the fine within less than an hour. The court ruled that the word 'cunt' is not always offensive when said in public compared to countries like the United States and that the fine would have constricted his right to political communication implied in the Constitution. Due to this ruling, he was not fined. The case was seen by law Professor Luke McNamara lawyers as a step towards protecting civil liberties. =Arrests= Lim was arrested for offensive behaviour at Barangaroo in January 2019. This was due to a sign which included the word 'CVNT' which was previously ruled by the courts as legal. He has since commenced legal action against the charge and the police officers who arrested him. A rally was held to protest the arrest which was reportedly attended by approximately 300 people. On 30 August 2019, the case was dismissed.https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/danny-lim-s-cvn-t-sign-not- offensive-court-rules-20190830-p52mgt.html References Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sydney Category:New South Wales local government politicians Category:Australian city councillors ","title":"Danny Lim (activist)"},{"id":"61129794","text":"Ron Ferri (August 19, 1932 ‚Äì June 13, 2019) was an American contemporary artist. He was a multi-media artist employing materials in both traditional and non-traditional ways, like oil on canvas, ink on paper, collage, with later works exploring the digital realm. He was most known for his neon works from the 60s and 70s.  Biography  Born in 1932, Ferri began his career as a professional ice skater, which was cut short when he was called to service in the United States Air Force where he served for five years as a flight navigator with tours in Africa, England, Italy, and Spain. After completing his service, he attended the Rhode Island School of Design, the Rochester Institute of Technology, New York University, and studied under Hans Hofmann at the Academie des Beaux Arts, Paris.

Their original product, the Alden Ocean Shell, was designed in (sources differ) 1970 or 1971. Traditional shell designs use high aspect ratio hulls, with long waterline with minimum beam, that emphasize racing performance at the cost of stability. These types of boats are only usable on flat water. Alden, however, specializes in shorter, beamier, highly stable designs which are suitable for rowing in open water, where swells are commonly encountered. As of 2004, Alden had sold 25,000 shells. History alt= The original Alden Ocean Shell was designed by Arthur E. Martin, a naval architect, trained at Webb Institute. Martin had begun experimenting with fiberglass as a boat-building material in the 1960s. His first design, a kayak, was developed in 1966. Over the next few years, he added a sliding seat and a deck to shed water; this evolved into the Alden Ocean Shell by 1970. Martin Marine was formed in 1971, located in Cohasset, Massachusetts. In 1972, the company moved to Kittery, Maine. Arthur Martin died in 1992, after which the company moved through several ownerships. As of 2006, it was headquartered in Rowley, Massachusetts, under the name Alden Rowing Shells. In the first year of production, 165 were sold. Martin also developed the drop-in rowing mechanism which came to be called the Oarmaster, which has since evolved over a series of design iterations. This was a metal frame containing the sliding seat, foot stretcher, outriggers, and oarlocks. The frame could be installed in many different boat designs. It isolated all the high stress loadpaths to the metal frame, eliminating point- loads on the boat's hull. The original 16-foot model was sold with spruce and mahogany oars produced by East/West Custom Boats, in Eliot, Maine. As of 2019, Alden Rowing produces a variety of 1x (single scull) and 2x (double scull) boats, ranging from 16 to 29 feet, all using the drop-in rowing unit concept. Race The Alden Ocean Shell Association (AOSA) was originally formed as a membership organization for people who owned Alden boats. The organization sponsors a race from Fort Foster to the Isles of Shoals, crossing of open ocean off the coast of Maine. In 2006, they reorganized into the International Recreational Open Water Association (IROW), and dropped the requirement for members to own Alden boats. The Mariners' Museum and Park has an Alden 16 in their collection. They describe the boat as having \\"a flat bottom for stability and a flaring bow for lift and dryness, all very different from the traditional narrow, round-bottomed, straight-sided shell\\".

The eastern offshoots of the Haemus here come very close to the shore, which they divide from the valley of the Hebrus. The people of Salmydessus were thus cut off from communication with the less barbarous portions of Thrace, and became notorious for their savage and inhuman character, which harmonised well with that of their country, the coast of which was extremely dangerous. Aeschylus, who incorrectly places the town in Asia Minor, describes Salmydessus as \\"the rugged jaw of the sea, hostile to sailors, step-mother of ships;\\"Aeschylus, Prom. 726. and Xenophon informs us, that in his time its people carried on the business of wreckers in a very systematic manner, the coast being marked out into portions by means of posts erected along it, and those to whom each portion was assigned having the exclusive right to plunder all vessels and persons cast upon it. et. seq. This plan, he says, was adopted to prevent the bloodshed which had frequently been occasioned among themselves by their previous practice of indiscriminate plunder. Strabo describes this portion of the coast of the Euxine as \\"desert, rocky, destitute of harbours, and completely exposed to the north winds;\\" while Xenophon characterises the sea adjoining it as \\"full of shoals.\\" The earlier writers appear to speak of Salmydessus as a district only, but in later authors, as Apollodorus, Pliny the Elder, and Pomponius Mela, it is mentioned as a town. Little is known respecting the history of this place. Herodotus states that its inhabitants, with some neighbouring Thracian tribes, submitted without resistance to Darius I when he was marching through their country towards the Danube. When the remnant of the Greeks who had followed Cyrus the Younger entered the service of Seuthes, one of the expeditions in which they were employed under Xenophon was to reduce the people of Salmydessus to obedience; a task which they seem to have accomplished without much difficulty.

It consisted of a large number of nuclear warheads buried between US missile silos, which would be triggered as the enemy warheads began to approach the bases. This would throw huge quantities of dust high into the air, which would abrade the incoming reentry vehicles, destroying them. It would also create enormous amounts of fallout which would kill tens of millions of US civilians, and the concept was never seriously considered for this reason. A variation of the dust defense was the basis for the Dense Pack deployment option for the MX missile. In this case the individual silos were built to survive any near miss, so the enemy warheads would have to impact the ground very close to the silo to destroy the missile within. This explosion would throw up dust, thereby creating a dust defense. Although this also caused a similar amount of fallout, in this case it was the enemy doing it, and they would do so anyway in any attack on the US silos.

However, in October 1862 he killed another West Virginia founder, local newspaper editor Lewis Wetzel, because he was displeased with a publication, which ended his political career.Caroliyn S. Quinlan, \\"John Hall\\" at www.wvculture.org/history/sesquicentennial/halljohn.pdf Early and family life John Hall Jr. was born in Tyrone County, Ireland, and was an infant when his father John Hall Sr. brought his family to Rockingham County, Virginia. He was still a boy when the family (including his brother James) moved to Mason County (then in Virginia). He never received a formal education, but learned to read and educated himself. He married Olivia Hogg, daughter of a local planter and granddaughter of Peter Hogg (a frontier surveyor and justice of the peace. They had ten children, although only one daughter would survive the long-lived father. Career By age 18, Hall had become a local deputy sheriff, and was elected the county sheriff in 1833, defeating John Hereford but only serving a single year before Hereford's re- election. In 1840, he owned six slaves, one woman older than 36, a young woman between 10 and 23 years old, and two young men of that category and two boys under 10.1840 U.S. Federal Census for Mason County, Virginia 52 of 69 This number grew to eight slaves in 1850 (possibly the same two women and an infant girl, as well as two young boys),1850 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedules for District 38, Mason County, Virginia p. 3 of 8 and decreased to five slaves (a 42-year-old woman; boys of 16, 13 and 6; and a 10-year-old girl) in 1860.1860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedules for Mason County, Virginia p. 4 of 4 Meanwhile, in 1844 Hall was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, but only served a single term.

After overcoming certain objections in the U.S. Congress, President Abraham Lincoln signed the bill authorizing the new state in December 31, 1862, and Hall again convened the convention which addressed those required changes on February 12, 1863, although Hall was unable to attend (because of the Wetzel incident below). Judge Abraham Soper of Tyler County chaired the sessions of the reconvened convention. Voters approved the result on March 26, 1863 and President Lincoln declared its compliance on April 20, 1863, so statehood became effective in sixty days.Fergusen, History of Mason County (NSDAR typescript) pp. 75-76 Meanwhile, both Hall's sons, VMI graduates who became Lt.Col.

The Battery was named after Dan Christie Kingman (March 6, 1852 - November 14, 1916) an officer in the United States Army who served as Chief of Engineers from 1913 to 1916. History =WWI= In the start of the 20th century changing technology meant that battleships out-ranged land based gun batteries. Brigadier General Dan C. Kingman saw this threat and had ordered the United States Army Corps of Engineers to design a new barbette carriage. To out-range battleships, the Model 1917 Barbette carriage, was introduced. He died, in 1916, during the design process so one of the Fort Hancock Batteries was named in his honor. The BCLR M1917 carriage allowed for a maximum elevation of 35 degrees, which added about to its range compared to the normal disappearing carriage. This new carriage system allowed M1895 batteries to fire at a high angle over in any direction. In 1917 construction began on two 12-inch gun M1895 at Fort Hancock with two guns each on long-range barbette carriages; these were completed in 1921 and named Battery Kingman and Battery Mills. =WWII= The rise of air power meant static ground defences like Battery Kingman were vulnerable to air attack. Batteries Kingman and Mills were modernized to meet this threat and their guns were protected from aerial bombing by the addition of thick concrete walls and roofs making it a casemate or fortified gun emplacement or armored structure from which guns are fired. In addition, several anti-aircraft gun batteries were installed in Fort Hancock.

In 2019, Tessmer began working with Nancy Wilson from the band Heart.

Its volunteer members take up roles such as mentors, confidants and communicators to help young students in ACT schools. Volunteers visit schools weekly during each school term. They provide one-on-one time with students in academic related activities such as literacy and numeracy. Mentors also work along with students in other activities such as building with Meccano, woodcraft, Lego, craft, and cooking. Volunteers come from various backgrounds including former teachers, engineers, economists, tradesmen, homemakers, lawyers, bureaucrats and business managers.  Overview  In 1997, a school volunteer program based on a Western Australian program was introduced in Canberra by the Canberra Weston Creek Rotary Club. Later on, the program was combined with two other existing volunteer programs, the School Volunteer trial program of Charnwood Primary School run at that time by St Barnabas Anglican Church, and the \\"STYLE\\" program run at that time by the Activities Probus Club of Weston Creek. In the end, the SVPACT which amalgamated all the programs, was launched in October 2005 at North Ainslie Primary School by the Governor General of Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery. It works in partnership with the ACT Directorate of Education and Training. SVPACT's stated goals, are to connect volunteers who want to make a difference with young people in school who need extra help. It harnesses the wisdom and skills of older generations to enrich the learning experience of young people who are at risk of falling by the wayside in an often overburdened school system. SVPACT's mission is to prepare and connect inter- generational volunteers with children who have been identified by a school as likely to benefit from engagement with a mature role model. As of 2016, up to 150 volunteers were providing mentoring services to 40 public schools in the ACT.  Programs  First Meccano set donated by Carol and Charlie Dearling * Academic Programs: The primary activity of SVPACT is to help students in academic programs such as literacy and numeracy. Volunteers work along with teachers help individuals students to improve their abilities in reading, writing, grammar and math skills. * Mentoring Using Meccano: In 2005, a request was made by some school principals for volunteers to mentor students who are bright but need help in improving communication or social skills. Carol Dearling, a retired school teacher, suggested using Meccano (a model building kit) for mentoring students, and donated the first Meccano set. This led to the formation of Mentoring Using Meccano project under SVPACT, where the local government and Rotary clubs provided financial support. The program gives students selected by the school staff a chance to spend an hour with an adult mentor while building a model using a Meccano set loaned to them long enough to complete their model, demonstrate the model and then take it apart, place all the pieces back in the case ready to be used by the next student. Where possible, the same mentor is assigned ‚Äúone-on-one‚Äù to a student for the duration of that student's project. A team of four or more students work with their respective mentors in a group environment. During the session, the student gets to communicate with his/her respective mentor, learn to read instructions and construct the chosen model. Upon completion, the student demonstrates the model in the class or Assembly. By the end of the program, the student learns about planning, patience, persistence, and gains dexterity. Completing the project gives the student a sense of accomplishment leading to the building of self-esteem. In some special cases, the program has led to a student being moved up a class or undertaking additional special education for which they previously could not be considered due to lack of communication skills. Mentoring using Meccano became a significant part of SVPACT, helping kids in 35 schools in the ACT. Bob Greeney, who has been leading this program since the beginning, is currently helping in the introduction of the program in other places like Bega, Merimbula, and Pambula. * Other programs include Lego, woodcraft and cooking. Awards SVPACT was named the Volunteer Team of the Year 2015, in the Education, Science, and Technology category.

Amofah was best known for his over-the-top reactions to Nintendo Direct presentations. Following several months that involved Amofah exhibiting signs of mental illness, as well as threatening suicide on multiple occasions, he disappeared on the evening of June 19, 2019, after uploading an apologetic video on YouTube in which he admitted to being mentally ill and suicidal. Amofah's body was discovered in the East River on June 24 by the New York City Police Department; he was believed to have jumped from the Manhattan Bridge. On June 26, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner determined that Amofah died by suicide by drowning. Early life Desmond Daniel Amofah was born on May 12, 1990, in Brooklyn, New York, to father Owuraku Amofah, a Ghanaian politician and lawyer from Kibi, Ghana, and mother Sabrina Amofah. Owuraku served as a member of the Parliament of Ghana for Abuakwa Central constituency from 1992 to 1996. Owuraku's father's relative (addressed by him as \\"uncle\\") Nana Akufo- Addo, of the prominent Ghanaian Ofori-Atta family, became President of Ghana in January 2017. Amofah had several siblings, including an older brother, Randy Amofah (born August 14, 1982), who died on October 31, 2010 from an asthma attack. Career =Modeling, streaming and YouTube career= Prior to the Etika branding, Amofah was active in modeling and rapping, having released an independently produced mixtape titled Written in Ice in 2007 under his pseudonym \\"Iceman\\". He started modeling in 2011 and continued until 2015. Amofah stated in a tweet that the name Etika came from the 2003 video game Sonic Battle, of which he was a fan of in his youth. In the game, players could input a cheat code titled \\"EkiTa\\", and when Amofah was 12, he simply switched the T and the K to create his username as he \\"liked that result better.\\" He started using YouTube to broadcast his gaming and reaction streams in 2012 under his original username \\"EWNetwork\\" (meaning \\"Etika World Network\\"). It was originally planned for the channel's content to be produced collaboratively by a variety of users including Amofah himself, but such plans never materialized. Prior to the closure of his main channel on YouTube in 2018, he had more than 800,000 subscribers between his YouTube and Twitch channels, and within months after creating a second YouTube channel, known as \\"EtikaFRFX\\", he had gained more than 130,000 subscribers. Amofah's content was typically Nintendo-focused. He frequently streamed reactions, often over-the- top, to Nintendo Direct presentations, which usually involved him screaming and falling out of his chair in elated shock. He dubbed his fans the \\"Joy-Con Boyz\\", after the Nintendo Switch controllers known as the Joy-Con, and would frequently end his videos with his signature catchphrase \\"Take care of yourself. Have yourself a damn good one!\\" Despite focusing on Nintendo related content, Amofah also did playthroughs of indie games (e.g. Undertale and Doki Doki Literature Club!), and played on the Minecraft server 2b2t. Amofah briefly changed his channel name to Young Ramsay in 2015, after cooking scallops and being inspired by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. Soon afterward, Gordon Ramsay followed Amofah on Twitter. In November 2016, two videos of Amofah's where he purported to have a Nintendo Switch console before its 2017 release gained notoriety and were scrutinized by fans. It would eventually be learned the model Amofah was using was 3D-printed by fellow YouTuber \\"Sandqvist\\" at his request. =Controversies and channel terminations= In November 2016, Amofah claimed he had gotten the Nintendo Switch early; he then revealed an accurate model of the console. Various drama channels such as \\"DramaAlert\\" reported on it. He would later reveal it to be a fake. In June 2017, Amofah revealed himself to be the victim of multiple \\"fake donations\\", or \\"chargebacks\\" of large amounts of money sent to his PayPal account via stream donations, which would jostle Amofah with hundreds of dollars in processing fees. On October 25, 2018, Amofah uploaded pornography to his YouTube channel EWNetwork (then titled Etika), which violated YouTube's policies and consequently led to the channel's termination. He later had his second channel EtikaFRFX terminated in April 2019 for the same reason. He was also banned from Twitch that year for using a homophobic slur during a stream. Following the termination of his EWNetwork channel, Amofah posted cryptic messages to social media, including the statement \\"it's my turn to die\\", coupled with a screenshot of his terminated account. Several of his followers felt that the messages and posts were suicidal in nature, which quickly created a panic within his following. Amofah took to social media that evening to confirm his well-being, along with other streamers who professed to having seen him safe and sound in person, so as to allay his followers' fears. He later apologized on his subreddit r/EtikaRedditNetwork. On April 16, 2019, Amofah tweeted that he was going to kill himself with a pistol he bought from a gun store in Long Island, which subsequently led to his arrest and hospitalization. Christine Cardona, who had dated Amofah from 2011 to 2017, confirmed his well-being, and that she had been \\"observing him all day\\". Days later, he posted a photoshopped picture of himself holding a gun, which Cardona later confirmed was fake. On April 29, after tweeting a vast quantity of cryptic messages, including homophobic and ethnic slurs (that were promptly deleted), he blocked close friends of his, including fellow YouTuber Sky Williams. Later that day, he live-streamed himself being detained by police to over 19,000 viewers on Instagram Live, after a concerned fan notified police about his alarmingly erratic nature during the livestream. He was detained again later that same week for assaulting a police officer. Amofah would then make an appearance on the YouTube channel \\"DramaAlert\\", run by Internet personality Keemstar, for an interview, in which he stated he was the \\"antichrist\\" and that he wanted to \\"purge all life\\". Disappearance and death On midnight of June 20, 2019, a YouTube video titled \\"I'm sorry\\" was uploaded to Amofah's personal YouTube channel TR1Iceman. In the video, Amofah admitted to having mental health issues, struggling with the attention he had gained from streaming, and apologized for pushing people away from him. The description of the video contained a suicide note. YouTube soon removed the video for violating its Community Guidelines, though Amofah's fans reposted the video to other outlets. Amofah was last heard from at 11:16 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on June 19 and was reported missing to the New York Police Department (NYPD) the following day. While the NYPD began its own search, fellow internet personalities and his fans tried to reach out to him to offer their help and show their appreciation of his work over the years. On June 19, the same day of Amofah's disappearance, his belongings were discovered on the pedestrian walkway of the Manhattan Bridge. They included a backpack, wallet, laptop bag, cell phone, a change of clothes and a Nintendo Switch. On the evening of June 24, a body was observed near Pier 16, approximately half a mile (0.8 km) down the East River from where Amofah's belongings were recovered, and reported to the NYPD. By the morning of June 25, the NYPD and emergency medical services had recovered the body, confirmed it was Amofah, and stated that he was dead at the point of recovery. The following day, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner confirmed the cause of death was suicide by drowning. =Reactions= Amofah's death highlighted social media platforms' handling of posts by users who appear at risk with mental illness or who are contemplating suicide. YouTube, in removing Amofah's final video, stated that removal of such videos is standard practice to \\"reduce the potential for copycat acts of self-harm, videos that express suicidal ideation\\", and as part of this, sent information to Amofah's account related to national suicide hotlines in order to provide help. Amofah's erratic behavior in the months prior to his disappearance led some of his followers to take the events preceding his suicide as a humorous performance by Amofah, rather than signs of him struggling with his mental health. Following his death, mental health researchers found several videos Amofah had posted that showed evidence of his troubled state but were taken as jokes by some of his viewers, rather than as signs of mental illness. As a result, some took Amofah's final video as another joke and disregarded any concern over his well-being; Keemstar initially thought Amofah's final video was a pre-meditated publicity stunt, and stated after Amofah's death that \\"I was never fully convinced that he was mentally ill or in trouble because of our private convos.\\" The aforementioned mental health researchers stressed the need to make more people on social media informed about the signs of mental illness, depression, and suicidal thoughts, so that they are able to recognize when people in a mindset similar to Amofah's are in danger and need support. Keemstar briefly became a target of some of Amofah's fans, who blamed him for Amofah's suicide due to the \\"DramaAlert\\" interview and statements made in tweets prior to and following the interview. Amofah's mother wrote to these fans in attempts to assure them that Keemstar was in no way responsible for Amofah's death, stating that \\"Etika loved Keemstar's show\\" and only wanted to make a memorable appearance on it. Legacy Following Amofah's suicide, fans on Twitter and in emails asked that YouTube re-upload Amofah's final video to help memorialize him. A Change.org petition was started and initially garnered more than 380,000 signatures, but later dropped to 197,000 signatures after many fraudulent signatures from internet bots were removed. It asked for Amofah's original channel to be restored to preserve his legacy. Another Change.org petition with over a million signatures, which later dropped to more than 200,000 signatures for similar reasons, called for Amofah to be buried at YouTube headquarters, which he stated as his wish during an earlier livestream. Fans later erected a memorial on Amofah's behalf on the pedestrian walkway of the Manhattan Bridge, leaving letters, fan art, Twizzlers, Nintendo-related products and other memorabilia. On June 25, 2019, YouTuber Abe Hunter announced he was the owner and operator of Amofah's website, and subsequently converted it into a fundraiser site where 100% of the profits were to be donated to The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in Amofah's name. On July 15, 2019, on behalf of the JOYCONBOYZ community, Abe Hunter donated the $11,315.25 raised in memory of Amofah. On July 21, 2019, YouTuber PewDiePie and American actor Jack Black started a fundraiser on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe for the NAMI. PewDiePie and Black streamed themselves playing Minecraft together to raise money for their fundraiser. PewDiePie himself donated $10,000, and raised over $30,000. On August 13, 2019, an Indiegogo campaign was started on Amofah's behalf. The charity campaign was created to earn donations for The Jed Foundation. Contributors to the campaign received a custom-made pair of Etika themed Joy-Con, dubbed \\"Etikons\\".https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/etikons-custom-etika-themed-joy- cons-for-charity--2/x/22111641#/ On November 6, 2019, it was revealed that after raising the initial $11,315.25 for NAMI, YouTubers Abe Hunter and Double-A worked with mural artist BK FOXX and graffiti artists Kestaadm and JMZWalls to create a 40-feet long mural dedicated to Amofah in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The mural was created to celebrate Amofah's life and to help bring awareness to mental health issues. The mural's location was added as a virtual \\"Pok√©Stop\\" in the augmented reality game Pok√©mon Go in February 2020 after over 350,000 people requested Niantic to add it in memory of Amofah.

The Bloemfontein Theater Group and Bloemfontein Repertory Society used the 464-seat venue to host ballet, opera, and drama. It later became the first headquarters of Sukovs (United Arts Society of the Orange Free State). Among the performances in the Stadskouburg was Frank Staff's ballet based on N.

University Innovation Fellows, also known as \\"UIFs,\\" have come from a wide variety of colleges and universities geographically, including Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, MIT, Stanford, and Washington University in St. Louis, as well as international universities including Peking University, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology and Zhejiang University.  Origin  The UIF program was created in 2012 as part of an Epicenter (the National Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation) grant, founded as a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded STEM center and directed by Stanford University, Stanford Technology Ventures Program (Stanford University School of Engineering's entrepreneurship center), VentureWell, and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. The first class of fellows was admitted in the summer of 2012. Since the establishment of the program 1,838 University Innovation Fellows from 258 collegiate institutions have participated in the UIF program, representing 20 different countries, including the United States, India, China, and Germany, among others. When the NSF grant period ended in June 2016, the University Innovation Fellows program became part of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford University.  Program  The UIF Program is structured as an intensive 6-week experience led by Stanford faculty and former UIFs. Fellows have been taught to conduct in-depth analyses of their societal and campus ecosystems, while exploring frameworks including Design Thinking and Lean Startup, and using their own experience to develop unique solutions to address unmet needs at their home institutions. Each cohort of fellows has culminated with a weekend spent in the d.school undergoing entrepreneurship and innovation sessions facilitated by Stanford faculty. As the Program capstone, speakers from the White House, Google, Design for America, 3 Day Startup, and Google X who are leaders in business and innovation, like Steve Blank and Sebastian Thrun, have been featured in panel discussions. After the capstone, Fellows have received year-round mentorship and attended national conferences and events together, while the global Fellows network has allowed for multi-institution collaborations.  Honors  The University Innovation Fellows Program was celebrated and profiled by the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) during the Obama Administration in 2014. This was in recognition of Obama's proclamation of November as National Entrepreneurship Month. In March 2015, the White House again featured the UIF Program, this time through its Office of the Press Secretary, as it lauded its efforts to combat the \\"60% of students who arrive at college intending to major in STEM subjects switch to other subjects, often in their first year.\\" By partnering with colleges and universities to launch ‚Äú#uifresh‚Äù (University Innovation Freshmen), the UIF-directed campaign was meant to expose incoming freshmen at a school to experiences in design thinking, entrepreneurship, and innovation and retain incoming students in STEM disciplines. Etienne Wenger-Trayner and Beverly Wenger-Trayner, two social scientists focused on social learning theory, wrote Designing for Change: Using social learning to understand organizational transformation, about the UIF program as a case study of a social learning framework of value creation.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades and Cascade Range. The mountain is situated south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, on the east side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Amphitheater Mountain, to the west-northwest. The Pacific Northwest Trail traverses the northern slopes of Apex Mountain as it crosses Apex Pass. Precipitation runoff from Apex Mountain drains west into Cathedral Creek, or east into Tungsten Creek, both tributaries of the Chewuch River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Early life Arthur Eli ('Art') Lavine was born December 20, 1922, in Trenton, N.J., the son of Barney and Helen Lavine, and brother of younger sister Audrey, an artist, who died in 1982. Lavine‚Äôs first ambition was to become a cinematographer. He had started photographing wth a box camera when he was eleven years old, and given a movie camera at age thirteen, he \\"used it to make home movies with titles like, ‚ÄòWar‚Äô and ‚ÄôMurder'\\" and in 1939 travelled daily from his home by train to film the World‚Äôs Fair in Flushing Meadows, which he edited into an hour-long film. He was president of the movie club in high school. However since no undergraduate courses were available in movie-making, he instead studied drama at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.Cohn, D. L., Scroggs, R., & Lavine, A. (1941). Chapel Hill. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Dialectic and Philanthropic Literary Societies of the University of North Carolina.  WW2 and New Caledonia  In early 1942 when the United States had already entered World War II, Lavine, then a 19-year old student, received notice to report for military duty, delaying his graduation. He was first assigned to the air corps to learn radio code, but his parents arranged to have him transferred to the army signal corps where he was sent to Astoria, N.Y., to become a darkroom technician. In April 1944 he was sent to New Caledonia, where he worked at a photo lab in Noum√©a. In order to become an official army photographer he was sent to Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, for three months. On return to Noum√©a, he was made supervisor of the photo laboratory serving in the rank of Corporal as a non-combatant photographer. Lavine documented the lives of New Caledonians, including the Kanak community, focussing mainly on family groups and children, all pictured during casual encounters in village environments.Prue Ahrens (2015) Editorial, History of Photography, 39:3, 209-212, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2015.1065136 His imagery, and that of his amateur colleague Corporal Elmer Williams, was a record of a tumultuous and difficult period of change in the archipelago that also brought the PX, Cuban cigars, ice-cream, refrigerators, sophisticated medical care, liquor, Jeeps, and jazz. Williams' work had been exhibited in late 2006 at the Tjibaou Cultural Centre curated from the Archives of New Caledonia by Dr Prue Ahrens of the University of Queensland, then touring Australia and then the United States, starting in San Diego. There, Arthur Lavine learned of the event through a friend and went to the opening with his own wartime photographs, which have since attracted scholarly interest.Moore, C., & Sandgren, H. (2011). Pacific Studies at the University of Queensland 1990-2011. After the War he studied with Clarence White Jr. in Maine, during which time he made his best-known photograph, Working Hands, Bath, Maine, 1947. New York In 1948 Lavine moved into his first apartment at Third Avenue and 53rd Street, NYC. Keen to get work, he advanced on his wartime training by joining the workshops and classes of Lisette Model, Alexey Brodovitch, and Berenice Abbott, heeding Model's instruction ‚Äúto go out in the street and photograph people, getting close and not being afraid.‚Äù His first success was a story on the Philadelphia Zoo that he sold for a Sunday feature.

Lavine's records of the Limelight gallery and caf√© provide a valuable historic record of a vital era in which photography was becoming collectible as an art form in America.Gee, H. (1991). 'Limelight: Remembering Gene Smith'. In American Art, 5(4), 10-19. As well as the emerging coffee houses, in that decade Lavine's street photography and photojournalism also covered the working class districts of New York, the demolition of the elevated railway, sharecroppers in Virginia for the Newport News, and farm workers in Kansas, Dakota and Nebraska. His 1960s subjects are diverse and include the anti-Vietnam marches and construction of the World Trade Center. Lavine attended the March 5 opening of his 2008 solo show Arthur Lavine photographe at the Mus√©e de Nouvelle- Cal√©donie for which two specialists, Kathy Creely of the University of California, and Prudence Ahrens, an art historian from the University of Queensland, produced a catalogue, the first publication of the museum to be devoted to photography. Corporate photography Lavine reduced his freelancing in the late '50s to become a corporate staff photographer traveling, widely across America to produce in-house publications, annual reports, press releases and displays, first for four years from 1956 at Western Electric Company, and then from 1960 to 1983 he directed the Chase Manhattan Bank, photography department, which entailed much traveling in the USA and abroad, and where he documented the beginnings of business computing. Lavine contributed to financial publications after retiring from Chase, and continued with personal photographic projects. Later life In 1992 Lavine settled in San Diego with his wife Rhoda and continued to produce and exhibit reportage, mood pieces and abstract works. Of such images shown in 2007 in Arthur Lavine: peripatetic wanderings and meditations at the Museum of Photographic Arts, Di Piero remarked; \\"He has always chased the stirrings of light on matter, and so in a way it‚Äôs appropriate that since moving to San Diego he has made many abstract pictures about the actions of the local light.\\" Lavine died aged 93 on June 27, 2016 at his Rancho Bernardo home after suffering Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. He was survived by his wife, two sons and three grandchildren. An archive of his documents and imagery is held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Publications = Books = *Cohn, D.

Similar deportations were organized by the Soviet regime in the fellow occupied Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania at the same time. Alongside smaller forced population removals, the two main waves of deportation were: * the first, June deportation of 14 June 1941 of around 15,500 people and their families. This wave of deportations was mostly directed at the local Latvian intelligentsia and political-social-economical elite.

Of the total number of deportees, more than 5000 people died in exile. People from Latvia were mostly resettled to Amur, Tomsk, and Omsk regions. Several smaller scale deportations took place during the Soviet occupation, especially of ethnic Germans, stateless persons from Riga, and Jehovah's Witnesses.

Mulledy, S.J. (; March 27, 1811 ‚Äì January 8, 1866) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who served as president of Georgetown College in 1845. Born in Virginia, he was the brother of Thomas F. Mulledy, who was a prominent 19th-century Jesuit in the United States and a president of Georgetown. As a student at Georgetown, Samuel was one of the founding members of the Philodemic Society, and proved to be a distinguished student, which resulted in his being sent to Rome to complete his higher education and be ordained to the priesthood. Upon his return to the United States, he became the master of novices at the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, before being named president of Georgetown. He sought to be relieved of the position after only a few months, and returned to teaching and ministry. Mulledy was expelled from the Society of Jesus over charges of alcoholism in 1850. He took up ministerial work at congregations throughout the northeastern United States, remaining at each for no more than a few years. Finally, controlling his alcoholism, he became chaplain to Archbishop John Hughes and was assigned as an assistant at the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in New York City (later known as St. Ignatius Loyola), where he eventually became pastor in 1863 and lived out the remainder of his life. On his deathbed, he petitioned the Jesuit provincial superior to allow him to be readmitted to the Society; four days before his death, his request was granted and he professed his vows.  Early life  Samuel A. Mulledy was born on March 27, 1811, in Romney, Virginia (today located in West Virginia). His father, Thomas Mulledy, was a farmer and a Catholic of Irish descent. His mother, Sarah Cochrane, was from Virginia and was not Catholic. So the two could marry, they obtained a canonical dispensation, and agreed that their sons would be raised Catholic, while their daughters would be raised Protestant. Samuel's brother, Thomas F. Mulledy, was 17 years older than him, and also became a Jesuit and the president of Georgetown College. = Education = At a young age, Samuel became a teacher with his brother at the Romney Academy. He then began his studies at Georgetown College in 1829, paying his own way like his brother. He paid some of his tuition in kind, in the form of two horses. At Georgetown, he became a co-founder and the first vice president of the Philodemic Society, which held its first meeting on September 25, 1830, and he signed its constitution. At the commencement of 1831, he received the class medal for rhetoric and mathematics, and an honorable mention in French; he also delivered an address in French. His brother was president of the college throughout Samuel's studies. Completing his secular education, Samuel sought admission to the Society of Jesus. His application was approved and, on August 29, 1831, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, where he completed his probationary period and took his simple vows. He was then sent to the novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome, being chaperoned across the Atlantic by William McSherry. Mulledy was sent to Rome for his higher studies because of his academic talent, so that he would be well educated and return to the United States to teach. In total, he studied in Rome for seven years, including at the Roman College, where he garnered a reputation as a distinguished student, and was selected to give a public defense of theology. Mulledy was then ordained a priest in Rome in 1840, and made his \\"grade\\" in the Society of Jesus.  Academic career  Mulledy then returned from Europe and was appointed on November 1, 1841, as rector and master of novices at the St. Stanislaus Jesuit novitiate, located in Frederick, Maryland. In 1844, he was made minister of Georgetown College. = Georgetown College = Mulledy became the president of Georgetown College on January 10, 1845, when James A. Ryder was recalled to Rome. He was young for a holder of the position, but was known as a talented scholar. He assumed the office reluctantly, and his short- lived tenure was generally uneventful. The entire college attended the inauguration of President James K. Polk in 1845, and upon the request of the Mayor of Georgetown, the college students marched in the parade commemorating President Andrew Jackson on July 1 of that year. Soon after taking office, he requested to be relieved, and he was succeeded by his brother, Thomas Mulledy, on September 6, 1845.  Later life  = Drifting years = alt=Georgetown College campus between 1848 and 1854 Following the end of his presidency, Mulledy returned to missionary work, being stationed at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. However, he continued to remain involved at Georgetown as a member of its board of directors from 1846 to 1848. From 1847 to 1848, he was a professor of dogmatic theology at Georgetown, and subsequently taught rhetoric there. Eventually, Mulledy became an alcoholic, which resulted in his dismissal from the Society of Jesus in 1850. Following his expulsion, he was transferred from city to city, staying only briefly in each. He first was stationed at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston for two years, then worked in the Diocese of Albany from 1852 to 1853. The following year, he was sent to the Cathedral of St. James in Brooklyn, where he remained until 1855. He was a professor of rhetoric and mathematics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, during the 1856‚Äì57 academic year. He then was assigned to the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in South Boston and St. Mary's Church in Yonkers, New York, in 1859 and 1860, respectively. = Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole = In July 1861, Mulledy was assigned by Archbishop John Hughes as an assistant to Walter J. Quarter, who was pastor of the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in New York City (later known as the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola). Mulledy was also the chaplain to Archbishop Hughes. Shortly before his death, Quarter sent a letter to the vicar general for the Archdiocese of New York requesting that Mulledy be appointed as his successor. Following Quarter's death, Mulledy, who was still recovering from his alcoholism, became the pastor of the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in 1863. During his first year, he had as an assistant priest W. Coyle, and James Hassan assisted him during his later years. Mulledy was well-liked by the congregation there, and he founded a chapter of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, to increase the charitable work of the parish. He was known for traveling around the parish with his large, black Newfoundland dog, which was both his pet and protection against stray dogs. Traveling for his ministry became difficult because of asthma, as well as an enlarged aorta in 1865. He ceased his ministry on Christmas Day of that year. He was the last secular pastor of the church. On his deathbed, he was attended by several Sisters of Charity, and John Early, the president of Georgetown, frequently inquired about his health. He supplicated the provincial superior, Angelo M. Paresce, to allow him to be re-admitted to the Jesuit order. When he received word that his request was granted on January 4, 1866, Mulledy leapt out of bed and pronounced the Jesuit formula on his knees, renewing his religious vows. Mulledy died in New York on January 8, 1866. His body was escorted by a large crowd from the Harlem Bridge up to St. John's College (later Fordham University) in the Bronx, where he was buried in the College Cemetery. Since Mulledy was once again a Jesuit at the time he died in office, Archbishop John McCloskey decided to transfer administration of the parish to the Jesuits, at Mulledy's request. His successor was the Jesuit priest Victor Beaudevin.

He laid the foundations of modern Serbian drama with his first major work \\"Centrifugal Player\\" (1930). Today he is considered one of the greatest European men of Serbian modern culture. Family Todor came from the affluent Manojloviƒá family, who lived in Beckerek on Michael Pupin Street. Todor's parents were attorney Nikola \\"Niko\\" Manojloviƒá and Sofija \\"Soka\\" Manojloviƒá, n√©e Petroviƒá. Death took them at the same time, they both died \\"of severe illness\\", after 19 years of a happy marriage. Niko died on 6 December, and Soka the next morning on 7 December 1899. Todor and his brother Ivan found themselves suddenly without parents, though Sofija's sisters Linka Krsmanoviƒá and Olga Putiƒá, as well as brother Joca Petroviƒá, immediately took over the responsibilities of caring for them while they were still in their teens. Education Portrait of Todor Manojloviƒá as a boy Todor became a recipient of the \\"Avramoviƒá Foundation\\", one of 50 theological scholarships granted by the Serbian Patriarchate then located in Sremski Karlovci. Beginning in 1894, when he was in junior high at Veliki Beƒçkerek, he received the 300-florin annual scholarship.\\"–°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ —Å–∏–æ–Ω\\", –ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Ü–∏ 1894. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ Early life He first studied law in Nagyv√°rad (today Oradea, Romania), where he met Hungarian poet Endre Ady who was six years his senior. With Ady and those writers and artists gathering around \\"Holnap\\" (Tomorrow), a paper in Nagyv√°rad became his \\"ticket\\" into the literary-art world which will completely occupy him for the rest of his life. From 1910 he studied art history in Munich, and from that time he corresponded with Vienna writer Stefan Zweig. The coming pre-war years he spent in Timi»ôoara, Florence, Rome, Venice where he studied with enthusiasm old art and its creators. He graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy, Department of Art History in Basel in 1914. Career The First World War found him in Italy. In 1916 he went to Corfu as a volunteer and contributor to Srpske Novine and Zabavnik. Between the two world wars, he lived in Belgrade and participated in public life as a cultural worker. Manojloviƒá's poetry was published in the entertainment journal Zabavnik. At the time French historian Gabriel Millet published an excellent study, La Serbie glorieuse, dealing with old Serbian art. Millet's study was published in the prestigious French art magazine L'Art et les Artistes. Manojloviƒá reviewed Millet's study in Zabavnik, praising the French archeologist's high regard for the history of Serbia. As a well-versed art critic, Manojloviƒá also reviewed exhibits in fine arts, and wrote about paintings by Milo≈° Goluboviƒá, Vasa Pomori≈°ac, and Mihajlo Petrov in Letopis Matice srpske in 1926. However, a well-written study about Claude Debussy revealed that Manojloviƒá was a connoisseur of the musical arts as well. This is even more remarkable having in mind that Debussy opened a new page in the development of French and European music at the time. Therefore, it was no surprise that from 1920 to 1924 Manojlovic held such diverse posts as Opera secretary, then Senate librarian and professor at the Belgrade Art Academy.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –®–ª–∞—ò—Ö: \\"–ú–æ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—ò–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥ –ë–µ—á–∫–µ—Ä–µ–∫–∞\\", –ó—Ä–µ—ö–∞–Ω–∏–Ω 2018.

Plot In 1883 London, a gaunt and somber serial killer named Martin Bauer, who as \\"The Hyena\\" had terrorized London for three years with a string of serial strangulations, is captured and condemned to hang. After the lunatic is executed, however, his body disappears from his grave and a new series of strangulation killings begins in the same area. Dr. Edward is convinced that Bauer has returned from the grave. His daughter Muriel is in love with an irresponsible young man named Henry Quinn, who is attempting to see her against her father's wishes. Edward's alcoholic assistant, Dr. Anthony Finney, is secretly in love with Muriel and frames Quinn as a suspect in the recent spate of killings, leading to the young man's arrest. It is later revealed that the killer is Dr. Edward, who stole Martin Bauer's body from its resting place and surgically grafted a piece of the killer's brain into his own, transferring the killer's mad compulsions to himself. The mad doctor is shot dead by the police as he is attempting to strangle Henry Quinn in the woods. Cast Cast is source from the book Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1957-1968. Production Director Luigi Mangini was predominantly a screenwriter, who has claimed to have written over 100 scripts, a number that film critic and historian Roberto Curti described as \\"a number that must be drastically toned down.\\" Prior to directing The Hyena of London, he wrote films as early as the mid-fifties with Toto all'inferno. Many of his screenplays were written under the pen name Henry Wilson. He debuted as a director in 1963, co-directing a political documentary on Russia with Piero Ghione, shot in the Monti Parioli district of Rome, at Villa Perucchetti. The film score by Francesco De Masi in The Hyena of London was taken from Riccardo Freda's film The Ghost and was later re-used in the film Beyond the Darkness.

It is a Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, non-spore-forming and facultatively anaerobic. Colonies are opaque, yellow-pigmented (atypical of Listeria species), with a flat shape and entire margin on BHI. Growth occurs at 22‚Äì42 ¬∞C, with optimal growth at 30‚Äì37 ¬∞C. It has motility at 37 ¬∞C. The bacteria is negative for catalase, haemolysis and nitrite reduction. It can be differentiated from other species of the genus Listeria by the absence of catalase reaction, production of acid from potassium 5-ketogluconate and production of a yellow pigment on BHI. It is presumably non-pathongenic due to the lack of haemolysis and pathogenicity genes on its genome. The species was isolated in August 2015 from the drainage system of a food-processing plant in the province of Alajuela, northern Costa Rica, through to a joint investigation of scientists from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR) in Cartago, Costa Rica and researchers from the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.

It publishes stories and essays that are exactly 100 words in length (also known as a drabble); each piece is published with an accompanying photo. The 100-word format forces the writer to question each word as they write it. The brevity of the form, and the magazine's presentation, allows the writer to \\"keep a story free from an explanation,\\" in the spirit of Walter Benjamin's philosophy of storytelling. The magazine reads submissions throughout the year.  History  The idea for 100 Word Story originated when Faulkner read Paul Strohm's 100-word stories that were published in Eleven Eleven Magazine. At the time, Faulkner was working on a long novel, and he became entranced by writing in such a succinct, compressed form. In a 2014 interview, Faulkner explained: > \\"Writing these smaller pieces was a nice break, and since I could squeeze > them into a somewhat-frenzied life as a working parent, they gave me a great > sense of creative satisfaction ... I could actually finish something.\\" In 2011, Faulkner and Mundell decided to create a journal that was exclusively dedicated to 100-word stories; this journal became 100 Word Story. Beret Olsen came on as photo editor in 2014. In 2015, Faulkner published a collection of his own 100-word stories, Fissures. He has also contributed essays about flash fiction to The New York Times, Poets & Writers, Writer's Digest, and The Writer. Regarding the challenge of the form, Faulkner and Mundell are often asked if a story can be told in only 100 words; however, they have both argued that most of the stories they publish have the same three-act structure of a conventional short story. Mundell described a good 100-word story as the following: > \\" One-fourth character, one-fourth setting, one-fourth point of view, one- > fourth plot. Fold all together gently, layering into a Pyrex dish. Heat it > up in the oven or stow it in the freezer, depending on how you want it to > taste. Then let it sit overnight. Test with a tablespoon. If it stands up, > the story is ready. If not, wait another day. Serve on a paper plate.\\" In another essay, Faulkner said that he learned that each line of a flash story carries a symbolic weight that moves the story forward; at the same time, gaps within and around the story speak as large as the text itself.  Publications  In 2018, Outpost19 published an anthology of 100 Word Story's best pieces, entitled Nothing Short of 100: Selected Tales from 100 Word Story. In April 2018, the book was featured as a recommended read on Lit Hub. In May 2018, The Millions featured a round table discussion on flash fiction with the book's editors and authors. Many of its stories have been included in a number of anthologies, including W.W. Norton's anthology New Micro: Exceptionally Short Fiction and the annual Best Small Fictions series. Its stories are also routinely included in Wigleaf's annual long- and short-lists of best flash fiction.  Reception  In a review of the magazine, the Review Review, a publication that critiques literary magazines, said: > \\"100 Word Story is not your average literary find on the web. It challenges > both the reader and the potential writer to choose carefully images and > words brought forth while reading and creating. The reader has the challenge > of taking the 100-word limit to mindfully fill in the spaces of the story > using their own experiences and imagination to take from the story what will > best fill them with a complete picture. The writer also faces this challenge > by working in a backward manner to extract parts of the story that do not > move it to a conclusion in an effort to meet the 100-word count. The > fascinating task to say the least.\\" Of the anthology, Nothing Short of 100, author Amber Sparks said: > ‚ÄúThese beautifully economical short stories (yes, truly stories) are > photographs built with words. They capture a moment and a lifetime, a > fraction and a whole. They are epics the size of sound bites, and they prove > once and for all that size doesn‚Äôt matter. Just the stories that fit > inside.‚Äù  See also  * List of literary magazines  References   External links  * 100 Word Story * Grant Faulkner * Lynn Mundell * Fissures * Going Long, Going Short * Online Lit Mag Showcases 100-Word Gems * A Flash Fiction Roundtable: Short but Never Small * The Making of Nothing Short of 100 Category:Magazines established in 2011 Category:Literary magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines published in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:English-language magazines Category:Mass media in Berkeley, California ","title":"100 Word Story"},{"id":"61132898","text":"A mamanteo or amuna is a pre-Columbian water harvesting system used in mountainous parts of Peru. It works by 'delaying' rainy-season runoff in the mountains so it can be used in lowlands settlements during the dry season. Using canals, the system targets floods to permeable sections of soil or rock. The water is filtered by the ground layers and emerges in downslope springs weeks or months later, where it can be used to mitigate drought. The technology may have been used by the Andean Wari culture as early as 700 AD, and some of the ancient systems have been restored in the 21st century to serve modern cities.  Modern restoration work  Lima is the world's second- largest desert city, behind Cairo, and served by a much smaller river than Cairo.. To meet the needs of a 'desert city which keeps growing', Sunass, the Peruvian national water agency, intends to '[combine] grey infrastructure with green infrastructure' and has created a tax-supported PES fund; some of this money has gone to regrouting mamanteos. As of 2016, ten mamanteos had been restored. A study of the system in Huamantanga, Peru modeled an expansion to serve modern Lima, claiming it could extend the growing season for local farms. The study authors measured the amount of water stored and the time taken to deliver the water downslope, and proposed an extrapolation model to estimate large-scale effects of up-scaling the system. A climate risk study by Peruvian hydrology agencies includes the restoration of amunas on its shortlist of adaptive practices that have 'low cost and high hydrological benefit', along with management of grasslands, restoration of wetlands and forests, and other hydrological engineering projects.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades and Cascade Range. The mountain is situated south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, on the east side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Haystack Mountain, to the northwest in Canada. Precipitation runoff from Windy Peak drains into tributaries of the Methow River and Similkameen River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Windy Peak from the north The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Background When the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea extended maritime nations' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to }, Australia designed and built 22 patrol vessels for 12 of its fellow members of the Pacific Forum. Australia provided the patrol vessel free of charge, and helped build port facilities and provide training. This allowed its neighbour to exercise sovereignty over their EEZ, intercept smugglers, and poaching fishers, and provide emergency services. Australia will replace Savea and her two sister ships with two slightly larger and more capable vessels between 2019 and 2020. Design The vessels displace 162 tonnes, and are built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, instead of more expensive, high- performance, military-grade equipment, to ease the maintenance burden, since local maintenance will be performed in small, isolated shipyards. Operational history In 1999 Savea carried scientists from the Ministry of Land, Survey, and Natural Resources to study a volcano that emerged from the ocean in early January 1999. A newly emerged volcanic island was observed from the air on January 8, 1999 northwest of Tongatapu Island. When first observed the island was approximately long, with a cinder cone. The cone was visibly venting fumes. By the time Savea arrived the island had been washed away, but fumes were still venting from underwater vents. On August 24, 2009, Savea was dispatched to rescue , a yacht in distress. She was proceeding with her captain and a single crew member. That crew member reported the captain fell overboard, and he did not know how to operate the vessel. In 2009, after 20 years of service, Savea returned to Australia for a major refit.

The film stars Claire Adams, Carl Gantvoort, Jean Hersholt, Harry von Meter, Charles Arling, and Mary Jane Irving. The film was released on April 9, 1922, by Goldwyn Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Lucy Bostil (Adams) and her father (Arling) have staked everything on their horse winning a race. Bill Cordts (von Meter) and his henchman Joel Creech (Hersholt) try to kill all the favorite horses so that theirs will win. Joel is fired and swears revenge. Shortly before the race is to take place Lucy finds Lin Slone (Gantvoort) who has been somewhat hurt in an encounter with a wild horse he calls Wildfire. She takes him to the ranch. Lin and the young woman are mutually attracted. Bill and Joel steal one of the Bostil horses and dope the other. Lucy and Lin substitute Wildfire for the race, with Lucy riding him as the horse only allows Lin or Lucy to mount him. Lucy rides Wildfire to victory in an exciting race. Bill had entered the Bostil horse in the race against Wildfire, having had the horse's face painted to prevent anyone from recognizing him, but the paint is accidentally rubbed and the deceit discovered. Joel, half-witted, makes a dummy so as to impersonate Lucy so that he imagine that he is taking revenge upon her by abusing it. Bill suggests that he get the real Lucy. Joel kidnaps Lucy and takes her to Bill's ranch. Bill, in the meantime, attempts to get back into the good graces of the Bostil's by sending them a note stating that he has rescued Lucy from Joel. Lin knows that she is in danger and rides to her rescue. Bill and Lin fight and Bill is killed. Joel ties Lucy to her horse and directs it towards a cliff while Lin races to the rescue. Joel is caught in a loop of his rope and is dragged to his death. Lin saves Lucy at the cliff's edge.

He belonged to the ensemble of the Vienna State Opera for 26 years and was the first Count Almaviva (The Marriage of Figaro) and the first Papageno (the Magic Flute) of the Salzburg Festival.  Life and career  Born in Vienna, Duhan was a \\"real Viennese\\", was born there, grew up there and completed his secondary school and his musical studies there. Besides singing with and Emil Steger, he studied piano, organ and music theory with Ferdinand Rebay and completed the conducting course with Franz Schalk and Felix Weingartner. With the exception of Salzburg, he rarely worked outside Vienna's city limits. Of course he made his debut at the Stadttheater of Troppau in 1910, as usual in the province at that time. On 27 April 1914, Duhan made his debut as Amonasro in Verdi's Aida at the Wiener Hofoper. In May, the baritone joined the Court Opera Association. He remained a member of the institute until 1940, not only as an esteemed baritone, but later also as a director and occasionally as conductor. In the Haus am Ring, Duhan sang at least 16 times Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro and 17 times Bassa Selim in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, 24 times Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca, 29 times Don Fernando in Beethoven's Fidelio and 62 times the prison director Frank in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss.Since the performances of the Vienna State Opera have only been fully recorded in the archives since 1955, it is quite possible that the number of roles and performances sung by Duhan could still increase. This also applies to his conducting. Duhan participated in three important world premieres: in 1916 he impersonated the music teacher and Harlequin in the new version of Ariadne auf Naxos by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss. He represented the music teacher a total of 60 times, Harlequin 76 times. From 1927 on, he sang and played the violin virtuoso Daniello 21 times in Ernst Krenek's highly controversial jazz opera Jonny spielt auf. In 1934, in the premiere of Leh√°r's Giuditta, he took over the Duke, whom he was to perform a total of 19 times. He also took over the role of Manuele Biffi 7 times. From the end of the 1920s, Duhan was increasingly used as a director and director, he was responsible for the smooth running of several hundred evenings at the Staatsoper. Hans Duhan also accompanied the Vienna State Opera on numerous tours to London, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Rome, Budapest, etc. In 1924, he sang the title role in Don Giovanni as well as Count Almaviva at one of these guest performances at the Paris Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in The Marriage of Figaro. = Salzburg Festival = Duhan made his debut at the Salzburg Festival as early as 1922: in the very first opera production of the festival he sang the title role three times in Mozart's Don Giovanni, at that time nobly called Don Juan, as the understudy of Alfred Jerger. He conducted Richard Strauss. His last appearance took place in 1937 at the last festival before the Anschluss, in a Liederabend together with the soprano Helen Gahagan, dedicated to \\"√ñsterreichs Gegenwart im Lied\\". Works were sung by Josef Matthias Hauer, Hans Ewald Heller, Rudolph Reti, Joseph Marx, Alban Berg, Wilhelm Kienzl and Joseph Rinaldini. At the piano Joseph Marx and Fritz accompanied Kuba. Two of the composers had to emigrate shortly afterwards, a third (Hauer) was defamed by the National Socialists in the travelling exhibition \\"degenerate music\\". In the 1920s and 1930s, Duhan was an important pillar of the festival - in 1922 also as the first Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro, in 1926 as the first cast of Don Giovanni, as prison director Frank in Die Fledermaus and as the music teacher in Ariadne auf Naxos, in 1927 again as Almaviva and Don Giovanni, in 1928 as first Papageno of the festival, 1933 as Melot in Tristan und Isolde and as soloist in Brahms' Deutsches Requiem,and from 1934 to 1936 again as Melot. As early as 1926 he was to perform a lieder recital, but this had to be cancelled due to indisposition. = Lieder recitals and oratorios = Duhan gave a series of lieder recitals, mainly singing works by Franz Schubert, Franz Liszt, Carl Loewe and Richard Strauss. Numerous audio documents of his song interpretations are available. He was the first singer to record all three song cycles of Franz Schubert - namely Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin, Winterreise and the Schwanengesang. This was realized in 1928 for the His Master's Voice recording company. He also endeavoured to produce works by contemporary composers; in addition to the composers mentioned in the Salzburg Liederabend, he also interpreted works by Erich Zeisl who was later forced to emigrate. His Christ in Bach's St Matthew Passion signaled him above all as an oratorio singer. = Singing teacher = From the 1931/32 season until 1955, Duhan worked as a teacher for opera drama at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna The changes in the teaching staff and in the structure of the Academy of Music and Performing Arts have, as reported, resulted in the termination of contracts with a number of outstanding teachers. At the same time as the measures were being taken to dismantle the school, negotiations were underway with numerous artists, including the Kammers√§ngerinnen Wildbrunn and Kiurina, in order to win them over to lead the newly designed master classes. These negotiations have already led to a conclusion with some artists, such as Paul Hartmann, Lothar Wallerstein and Hans Duhan. until 1955 Duhan worked as a teacher of opera drama at the Vienna Music Academy. He trained numerous baritones, bass baritones and basses of the following generation, among them Hans Braun, Ernst Gutstein, Erich Kunz, Peter Lagger, Hermann Uhde and Otto Wiener, as well as the tenor Waldemar Kmentt. = Composer and conductor = * Mozart. A singspiel in two acts and an epilogue, libretto by Julius Wilhelm and Paul Frank. Gabor Steiner Verlag, Wien/Leipzig 1923. World premiere on 2 June 1923, Vienna Volksoper. The Dreim√§derlhaus has moved to Salzburg and has become mossy. A singspiel doesn't need to be a biography, and whether a few incidents are postponed or swapped will only bother one professor of music history, not the audience. If only the human is true and unchanging. In the book by Wilhelm and Frank alone, a jovial, flat-headed fellow hangs around under the name Mozart, who with the \\"enormously benaste\\" original has only a few similarities with the profile of Duhan, his performer. We do not make a being out of the fact that this Mozart is seduced by the sight of the Salzburg landscape, which is seductive, into a kind of tourist guide waltz: \\"Salzburg, Salzburg, you are the jewel, the pearl of Austria\\". More troubling to us is that Mozart only marries Stanzi in Prague after the performance of \\"Don Juan\\" and cheats on her with her sister Aloysia on her wedding day. And most of all, that there in Prague the mysterious messenger of Count Walsegg appears, orders the Requiem and, as Mozart declares that he is not in the mood, puts him in the mood with a hundred ducats. For money, Mozart wrote pieces for music boxes and organ rolls, not his own death music. Mozart, who, as is well known, attached particular importance to \\"action\\" in a textbook, that is the plot, will see his error afterwards, because Wilhelms and Frank's book is one almost without \\"action\\". Little happens, the idle are standing around on stage, and yet the audience likes it. This is the effect of Wolfgang Amad√©'s folk-like figure, who himself seems to be distorted, who has stepped down in life, unknown, where he was buried and, after his death, transfigured [sic] or exploited. Duhan composed this book, and it is probably the first time that a singer has written an operetta to sing the leading role. A sensational scent from which the older bland Mozartsingspiele (by Lortzing, by Riotte) were free. Duhan spreads out a pretty salon music, amused melodies that oscillate between Toselli and Richard Strauss, between Rei√üiger and Eisler, a rhythm of sure victory favor, an instrumentation that is in love with the celesta to the ears. He is a good, a very talented musician, rarely uses Mozart (das Veilchen, the Requiem), denies everything of his own, and everything would be fine if it weren't Wolfgang Amad√© Mozart who has to sing Duhan... The audience, however, likes it - but it is nicer the other way round: when Duhan Mozart sings ... However, the audience knew no reservations and prepared the \\"Mozart\\" for the great stormy recording. It said, \\"Mozart,\\" and it meant Duhan. First and foremost, the success is probably also a personality success of the singer and composer, and without him the piece seems unthinkable. Charming in the first, moving in the last, in the act of death. Mr. Duhan has every reason to be stifled with the performer of the main character, probably he is also stifled with the conducting Kapellmeister Leo Krau√ü and the other performers, as one could read from his radiant face. Very kind are Mrs. Wagschal as Aloysia and Mrs. Friedl B√∂hm as Konstanze, who had a special success with the duet Wenn's's nur schon sp√§ter w√§r and an inserted Italian aria from the R√© pastore. Mr. Kurth is an excellently fibbing Josef Lange (\\"a bag of wind\\"), Dr. Kr√∂gler an elegiac, jealous S√º√ümeyer suffering, Mr. Lazer a heavily loaded Schachtner and Mr. Puntschart a cozy round host of yours. Not to forget the unfortunately too little used Niese comic of Mrs. Griebl as Veronika. The picturesque view of Hohensalzburg, the splendid apartment of the Duschek couple in Prague and the beautiful cheerful rococo costumes were also successful. But Duhan was Hans Dampf in all gases (?), he will play another role soon, will step down from the stage to the podium, and conduct his work himself. Some things touched us strangely; we doubt whether Duhan had to \\"bring Mozart closer\\" to us in this way; but Mozart certainly brought Duhan closer to all of us. und S. 6 Occasionally he also stood on the podium of the Vienna Philharmonic: once each time he conducted the Der fliegende Holl√§nder and Lohengrin, twice Verdi's Rigoletto and five times Puccini's Tosca.  Miscellaneous  From 1934 to 1938 Duhan was a member of the Federal Cultural Council as a representative of the art group, designed programmes for \\"patriotic events\\" and was closely associated with Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg and the Heimwehr. In 1919 Wilhelm Kienzl dedicated his Op. 96 to him. Aus des Volkes Wunderhorn. A collection of fifteen folk poems, set to music for a middle voice with piano accompaniment by Wilhelm Kienzl. Dedicated to Hans Duhan in the highest artistic esteem.Stock of the Austrian National Library Duhan, who was married to Erilda (Eri), n√©e Strell (7 March 1894 - 14 July 1962) died in Munich.

Most of the tablets date from the mid-7th to mid-8th century, but some are as late as the early modern period. They have been found in sites across Japan, but mostly around the old capitals of Nara and Fujiwara. They were used for informal purposes, such as shipping tags, memoranda, and simple messages, and thus complement official records transmitted on paper.  Finds  The first mokkan was found in Mie Prefecture in 1928, but extensive caches have been found during construction work since the 1960s, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. In August 1988, some 50,000 tablets from the early 8th century were found during the excavation for a department store in Nara. The site that turned out to be the residence of Prince Nagaya, a minister of the Nara court, and the tablets have improved historians' understanding of the period. Over 150,000 have been recovered.  Language  Some mokkan are written in Classical Chinese, but many are written in Old Japanese, demonstrating that literacy was widespread in the late 7th century. The texts are typically short and more colloquial than the formal poetry and liturgies that make up the main corpus of Old Japanese.

Also on November 19, 2015, a jury found defendant Andre Levon Glover guilty on seven counts, including the two counts described above. On appeal, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion on January 31, 2017, denying both defendants‚Äô challenges and affirming the district court‚Äôs judgment below.United States v.

The elements clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it ‚Äúhas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,‚Äù and the residual clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it, ‚Äúby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.‚Äù In Dimaya, the Court addressed (and invalidated) a residual clause identical to the residual clause in ¬ß 924(c) but did not address the elements clause. Thus, the Fifth Circuit held the residual clause in 924(c) unconstitutionally vague under Dimaya but did not invalidate the elements clause in that section. As a result of this holding, the Fifth Circuit affirmed its prior judgment as to the Hobbs Act robbery count but vacated as to the aiding and abetting conspiracy count, because the former relies on the elements clause while the latter relies on the residual clause.

Favourite themes included motherhood and the mysteries of race and heredity. Biography =Family provenance= Johanna Mathilde \\"Ina\\" Seidel was born in Halle, the eldest of her parents' three recorded children. Half a year later the family relocated to Braunschweig which is where for approximately ten years she grew up. Her father, Hermann Seidel, was a senior surgeon at the city's main hospital. Hermann Seidel's suicide in 1895 left his widow and her children to live in seriously reduced circumstances. It is thought that he was driven to kill himself by the ferocity of the \\"office politics\\" in play at the hospital where he worked. There was also an uncle, Heinrich Seidel, a larger than life engineer who in addition made his mark as a poet-novelist. Ina Seidel's mother, born Emmy Loesevitz (1861‚Äì1945), came from a northern family. At the time of his death Emmy Loesevitz's father, Wilhelm Loesevitz (1828‚Äì1861), had been working as a businessman in Riga. As a result of Emmy's remarriage, Ina Seidel acquired as a step grandfather the distinguished Egyptologist and author Georg Ebers (1837‚Äì1898) After her father's suicide her mother took the children to live in Marburg in 1896 and then to Munich in 1897. As a teenager, around the turn of the century Ina Seidel became involved with the exuberant arts scene focused in Munich's Schwabing quarter. Ina Seidel's brother, Willy Seidel (1887‚Äì1934), also became a writer. Annemarie Seidel (1894‚Äì1959), her younger sister, became an actress and married a Dutchman. =Marriage and family = In 1907 Ina Seidel married her cousin, the evangelical minister and author Heinrich Wolfgang Seidel (1876-1945). The genealogical intricacies of their kinship meant that her family name remained the same as before. The couple moved to Berlin where Heinrich had been assigned a parish to look after. The next year, following the birth of her first child, Heilwig, she became ill with childbed fever. She was able to live a conventional life as a minister's wife, house wife and mother, but the very slow rate of her recovery meant that she was stuck at home for much of the time. She never fully recovered.Gisela Brinker-Gabler, Karola Ludwig, Angela W√∂ffen: Lexikon deutschsprachiger Schriftstellerinnen 1800‚Äì1945. dtv M√ºnchen, 1986. . p. 270 Writing, which till that point had been a \\"private sideline\\" for her, became a more prominent part of her life. She wrote poems and linked up with the aristocratic literati around B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen (1874‚Äì1945) and the G√∂ttinger Musenalmanach set, which included Lulu von Strau√ü und Torney (1873‚Äì1956), and Agnes Miegel (1879‚Äì1964). The couple moved with their child to Eberswalde (between Berlin and Stettin) in 1914. Ina's son, Georg Seidel, was born in 1919. He later built a career as a reporter, critic and essayist using the pseudonyms \\"Christian Ferber\\" und \\"Simon Glas\\". =War years= Like many of her social background in Germany and England, Ina Seidel's initial reaction to the outbreak of war in July 1914 was to welcome it. She also shared with her friends the belief that her poetry deserved a wider readership. B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen had recommended her to his own publisher. Between 1914 and 1933 Ina Seidel published five volumes of lyric poetry. Her volume of war poetry, \\"Neben der Trommel\\" (loosely, \\"Beside the drum\\") followed in 1915. \\"Das Haus zum Monde\\" (loosely, \\"The House on the Moon\\"), her first novel, appeared in 1916. =German republic period= Further works appeared during the republican years. In \\"Das Labyrinth\\" (1922) Seidel told the life story of a protagonist called \\"Georg Forster\\" who resolves the conflict between his unfulfilled life's ambitions and an unmanageable wider world through recourse to Christian sacrifice. During this period she also became involved with the women's rights movement. The family returned to Berlin in 1923 when accepted a posting to take charge of the parish duties at the Neue Kirche, Berlin. Seidel's work during her \\"second Berlin period\\" reflected the wider literary trends of the 1920s, displaying a new willingness to experiment. In her historical novel \\"Die F√ºrstin reitet\\" (loosely, \\"The Princess rides out\\", 1926) she intertwines known historical events with imagined scenes of her own devising in order to outline a narrative for the remarkable rise to power of the German-born Russian empress, Catherine the Great. In the view of at least one commentator, there is something curiously contemporary in Seidel's portrayal of a \\"patriarchal society without men\\", reflecting the realities of postwar Germany diminished through the slaughter of a generation of young men on the battle fields during the previous decade. Her rural novel \\"Br√∂mseshof\\" (1927) represents a remarkable contrast, showing how closely the author was able to orient herself around traditional social precepts. During the 1920s she also published essays and undertook work as an editor. In commercial terms Seidel's break-through novel was \\"Das Wunschkind\\", which appeared in 1930, and on which she had been working since 1914. The novel traces the experiences a mother during the Napoleonic Wars. This character's individual fate is so closely entwined with the destiny of the nation that in the end she sacrifices her son to it. Despite appearing during the final part of the so-called Weimar period sales of \\"Das Wunschkind\\" really took off only after the Hitler government took power in 1933. In the view of at least one scholar book enjoyed official approval because of the extent to which it provides a \\"model for subsequent literary representations of motherhood that embraced Nazi ideology\\". Through the violent shifts in German history that took place during the next couple of decades, \\"Das Wunschkind\\" continued to find plenty of readers. On 29 January 1932 Ina Seidel was admitted to membership of the Prussian Academy of Arts. She was only the second woman to receive this honour: the first had been Ricarda Huch. Her (politically right-wing) friend B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen criticised her for accepting an honour conferred by republican political establishment, but in the end the friendship and political alignment between the two of them appears to have survived longer than the German \\"Weimar\\" republic.Angelika D√∂pper-Henrich: ‚Äû‚Ä¶es war eine tr√ºgerische Zwischenzeit‚Äú. Schriftstellerinnen der Weimarer Republik und ihr Verh√§ltnis zu den gesellschaftlich-politischen Umgestaltungen ihrer Zeit. Dissertation, Frankfurt am Main 2002/04, p. 246. =Hitler years= After several years of renewed austerity, intensifying political polarisation and parliamentary deadlock, the National Socialists took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. The Hitler government accelerated the cyclical economic recovery already under way, and unemployment finally began to fall rapidly. Antisemitism now became an underlying pillar of government strategy, and those with a Communist past encountered a new level of thuggishness from the security services, but the full horrors of the Nuremberg Laws, the disastrous war and the holocaust still lay on the future, and there were many who were neither left-wing political activists nor Jewish, who welcomed a return to what looked like political stability and economic prosperity. Ina Seidel herself was one of many who quickly demonstrated a robustly patriotic level support for National Socialist ideology, as did her ultra-conservative friend B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen. In October 1933 she was one of 88 high-profile authors who signed the subsequently infamous Vow of Total Loyalty (\\"Gel√∂bnis treuester Gefolgschaft\\") to the leader, Adolf Hitler.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 565. Seidel's public support for the Hitler government would remain steady till the regime's collapse. In 1934 she moved out of Berlin and settled in Starnberg, a Bavarian lakeside resort town located between Munich and The Alps. In 1938 her second blockbuster novel, \\"Lennacker\\", was published. Hans Jakob Lennacker, orphaned and returning from the war in 1918, becomes ill with influenza while visiting his aged and religious aunt. He experiences twelve feverish dreams during the twelve nights between Christmas and Epiphany. He revisits twelve generations of his German forebears, each one a protestant pastor. In this way the book provides a vision of the rise and, some said, decline of Protestantism in Germany. Many National Socialist true believers would have seen the novel as an implicit acknowledgement of the importance of Christian values and traditions which the authorities were always keen to try and invoke in support of their own quasi-religious political project. Seidel's continuing faith in the \\"Cult of the Leader\\" resurfaces in her poem \\"Lichtdom\\" which appeared in 1941 in the volume \\"Anthologie Dem F√ºhrer\\" (\\"Anthology to the Leader\\"). The final two lines of her tribute read, \\"Hier stehn wir alle einig um den Einen, und dieser Eine ist des Volkes Herz\\" (loosely, \\"Here we all stand united around the one [man], and that one man comes from the heart of the people\\").Published in \\"Anthologie Dem F√ºhrer. Worte deutscher Dichter. Selected by August Friedrich Velmede. Tornisterschrift des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht (Abteilung Inland), 1941, p. 15. The poem was one she had originally presented to Adolf Hitler two years earlier on the occasion of the leader's (widely celebrated) fiftieth birthday. She had also marked the occasion by sending Hitler a personal telegramme of congratulation. Seidel's romantic novel \\"Unser Freund Peregrin\\" appeared in 1940. In 1942 she teamed up with Hans Grosser to produce \\"Dienende Herzen, Kriegsbriefe von Nachrichtenhelferinnen des Heeres\\", a series of biographical essays which glorified the women supporting the army through war work. Other war-time publications included biographical essays on the icons of German romanticism, Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim, which appeared in 1944. During the closing phase of the war Ina Seidel was one of 1041 artists listed on the 36 page so-called List of those Gifted by God (\\"Gottbegnadeten list\\"). The list was compiled by Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler: it featured those whose artistic contributions the National Socialists valued most highly.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 564. =After the war= War ended in May 1945 and the twelve year National Socialist nightmare ended with it. Ina Seidel immediately resigned her membership of the Prussian Academy of Arts, which by this time would have been discredited by its close links with the pre-1945 government. She herself faced strong criticism because of her record of strong public support for the Hitler government. However, within the American, British and French occupation zones her books very soon returned to favour with the reading public, and they continued to find plenty of buyers and readers till well into the 1960s. During the 1950s she produced two further major novels with which she sought to rescue her reputation. In \\"Das unverwesliche Erbe\\" (1954: loosely, \\"The inalienable legacy\\") the expanded on the Christian aspects of her work. In her final novel, \\"Michaela\\" she expressly accepted, on behalf of herself and of the upper-middle class more widely, a share in the responsibility for National Socialism. Despite fierce rejection by mainstream literary critics in West Germany (as the western occupation zones had become in 1949), her last novel was another major success with readers. As a result of the postwar division of Germany the old Prussian Academy of Arts was effectively replaced by two institutions. In 1955 Ina Seidel was admitted to membership of the western Academy of Arts in West Berlin. Long before she died, in 1974, her principal works had been translated into a number of foreign languages. A less than flattering obituary in Die Zeit nevertheless described the report of her demise as one of those to which one's first reaction is surprise that the deceased had not already died many years earlier (\\"Ja, hat sie noch gelebt?\\").

John, Count of Armagnac, who commanded the local French forces, avoided battle, and there was little fighting during the campaign. The Anglo-Gascon force of 4,000‚Äì6,000 men marched from Bordeaux in English-held Gascony to Narbonne and back to Gascony, devastating a wide swathe of French territory and sacking many French towns on the way. While no territory was captured, enormous economic damage was done to France; the modern historian Clifford Rogers concluded that \\"the importance of the economic attrition of the chevauch√©e can hardly be exaggerated.\\" The English component resumed the offensive after Christmas to great effect, and more than 50 French-held towns or fortifications were captured during the following four months. In August 1356 the Black Prince headed north on another devastating chevauch√©e with 6,000 men; he was intercepted by the main French army, 11,000 strong, and forced to battle at Poitiers, where he decisively defeated the French and captured King John II of France. Background Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France () and Edward III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward III in France should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years. Before the war commenced, well over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony. Among their cargoes were more than of wine. The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux had a population of more than 50,000, greater than London's, and Bordeaux was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, mostly from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. France in 1330. The diminished Gascony alone remained under the English crown. Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward III was able to spare few resources for its defence, and previously when an English army had campaigned on the continent it had operated in northern France. In most campaigning seasons the Gascons had to rely on their own resources and had been hard-pressed by the French. In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a strong force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000‚Äì6,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons. In July 1346, Edward III landed the main English army in Normandy in northern France. Philip concentrated French forces against this threat and over the following year the Anglo-Gascons were able to push the focus of the fighting away from the heart of Gascony. The French port of Calais fell to the English on 3 August 1347 after an eleven-month siege and shortly after the Truce of Calais was signed. This was partially the result of both countries being financially exhausted. The same year the Black Death reached northern France and southern England, resulting in the death of approximately 45 per cent of the population. Fighting continued in Picardy and Brittany, and especially fiercely in south-west France, where the English raided deep into French territory, but no large forces took the field. Negotiations for a permanent peace commenced in 1353 in Avignon under the auspices of Pope Innocent VI and the war died down to skirmishes and small-scale raids. These talks collapsed in early 1355. In April 1355 Edward III and his council, with the treasury in an unusually favourable financial position, decided to launch offensives that year in both northern France and Gascony. John II of France () attempted to strongly garrison his northern towns and fortifications against the expected descent by Edward III, at the same time assembling a field army; he was unable to, largely due to lack of money. Prelude Edward, the Black Prince In their 1345 and 1346 Gascon campaigns, the English had pushed the main front back well beyond the borders of Gascony to the north and west, among other things guaranteeing its food supplies and putting the Gascon territory beyond reach of French advances from those directions. Numerous French-held castles and small towns remained within what was nominally English territory, just as the English had outposts deep within French territory. To the immediate south lay the County of Armagnac, largely untouched by the war. It was the heartland of John, Count of Armagnac, the French King's personal representative in the south west and the most powerful French noble in the region. John had long been a proponent of pressing the war against Gascony. He had ignored his orders to keep the truce in 1354, raiding repeatedly into Agenais and besieging several important towns, albeit unsuccessfully. In spring 1355 he again made unsuccessful attempts to capture English-held towns. Frustrated, and with the peace talks having failed, he launched repeated raids deep into Gascony throughout the summer, to great effect. He devastated agricultural areas and burnt down the suburbs of several Gascon towns. Edward III's eldest son, Edward of Woodstock, later commonly known as the Black Prince, was given the Gascon command and began assembling men, shipping and supplies. He was scheduled to sail in July, but eventually set off on 9 September, arriving in Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, on the 20th accompanied by 2,200 English soldiers. The next day he was formally acknowledged as the king's lieutenant in Gascony, with plenipotentiary powers. The Gascon nobility pressed on him the advantages of striking at the County of Armagnac. The Black Prince agreed to make Armagnac his first target. Gascon nobles, who had been preparing for the expedition for some time, reinforced him to a strength of somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 and provided a bridging train and a substantial supply train. The latter largely carried grain for the horses, although later it was used to transport the spoils of the chevauch√©e. The English expedition to Normandy was intended to be carried out with the cooperation of the French magnate Charles II of Navarre, but Charles reneged on the agreement. Instead a chevauch√©e, a large-scale mounted raid, was attempted from the English enclave of Calais in November. However, the French King had stripped the area of fodder, food and potential booty, causing the English to return to Calais within ten days. They had achieved nothing, but did focus French attention on the north. Chevauch√©e =Heading east= alt=A map of south-west France showing the route of the On 5 October 1355 the Black Prince's Anglo-Gascon force left Bordeaux on their own carefully planned chevauch√©e. It took in reinforcements and supplies at Saint-Macaire, to the south, and continued through Bazas, reaching the border with Armagnac on 12 October. The rapid march to this point caused many of the expedition's 15,000 horses to die or break down, especially those which had accompanied the English on the exhausting eleven-day sea voyage and been given inadequate time to recover; this had been allowed for, and they were replaced locally. Before crossing the border new knights were dubbed, as if it were the eve of a formal battle, and banners were unfurled. As soon as Armagnac was entered the army started devastating the countryside; the Anglo-Gascons divided into three columns, which marched parallel to each other, to maximise the destruction. Over eleven days the chevauch√©e traversed Armagnac from west to east, in sight of the Pyrenees. The weather was fine, and one combatant reported the area to be \\"a noble, rich and beautiful region\\". Most towns were fortified in name only and were easily stormed and burnt. Within reach of the line of march only two towns escaped destruction. The Black Prince wrote \\"we rode... through the land of Armagnac, harrying and wasting the country, the [Gascon lords] were much comforted.\\" John of Armagnac deliberately avoided battle, even though the French forces in the region outnumbered the English. He was reinforced by James de Bourbon, Constable of France, and Jean de Clermont, Marshal of France, and the French concentrated in the strongly fortified large city of Toulouse, expecting a siege. They broke the bridges enabling access to the city and confidently expected the Black Prince to withdraw to Gascony once he saw the strength of the fortifications. The English passed within a few miles of the city and continued east, fording the strongly flowing Garonne and Ari√®ge rivers; the former described by a member of the expedition as \\"rough, rocky and most frightening\\" and the latter as even \\"more dangerous\\". Several horses and a small, but unknown, number of men were lost during the operation, but the supply wagons all crossed successfully. This took the French by surprise; they had not even guarded the fords. A town being sacked The area they now passed through was known as the granary of southern France; a contemporary described the area east of Toulouse as the \\"fattest land in the world\\". The English continued to burn everything they could, targeting windmills in particular; as a region unable to grind its own grain was unlikely to be able to provide a surplus to support the French military. As before, they stormed all but the largest towns and strongest castles, often amidst brutality and slaughter. Small groups ranged at least from the main body, looting and burning smaller places across a wide front. The major city of Carcassonne, east of Toulouse, was the cultural, political, religious and financial centre of the area and was captured when the population abandoned the town and retreated to the strongly fortified citadel. They offered a huge sum if the English would spare the town, but this was refused. After three days of rest and looting the town was thoroughly fired. The tax records for the region were also captured, which enabled the English to form an accurate view of the damage they were doing to the French economy and war effort. They continued east, in weather which had turned wintery: \\"the whole area was burned\\" according to a participant. Two days later, on 8 November, they reached Narbonne, from the Mediterranean. It was only a little less populous than London, but again the town was rapidly captured and sacked while the citadel was ignored. The French in the citadel responded by bombarding the English with artillery. The whole of southern France was in uproar. A major offensive so late in the year had not been expected and the Black Prince's willingness to march from his base, crossing rivers considered impassable to large bodies and living off the land, took the French completely by surprise. English scouts, foragers and arson parties pushed out in all directions from Narbonne, some as far as . French towns up to away began hastily reinforcing their fortifications. Two nuncios arrived from Pope Innocent, attempting to arrange a truce; they were turned away, being told to apply to Edward III. =Returning west= John, Count of Armagnac John of Armagnac, with Bourbon and Clermont, moved at least part of the French army to Homps, west of Narbonne, where the road crossed the River Aude. They apparently hoped to force the English to attack them across the river, and so fight at an advantage. The English were unable to remain in any one place for long, as it soon became stripped of food, especially fodder and grain for the 15,000 horses with the army. So on 10 November the English moved out from Narbonne, their rearguard and stragglers being harassed by a sortie of the town militia. The English crossed the Aude north of Narbonne and then headed north east towards B√©ziers; their scouts reported that the town was strongly held, and so after a council of war they turned back to the west, expecting to have to fight Armagnac's force. It was an arduous march and water was short; one chronicler writes that the horses, which would normally require of water each day, had to be given wine instead. The French retreated to Toulouse, not wishing to meet the English on equal terms, when they anticipated that the English combined arms tactics and use of longbowmen would lead to their defeat. The Black Prince pursued them as far as Carcassonne, where, struggling to forage in territory which had already been well picked over, he struck south towards the prosperous city of Limoux, which was destroyed. On Sunday 15 November the English army razed four large French towns and devastated the surrounding area, while their leaders were inducted as lay brothers at the Dominican monastery at Prouille. The English then turned east again, across the County of Foix. On the 17th the Black Prince met with Gaston, Count of Foix, the most powerful French noble in the region after Armagnac, and a great enemy of his. The details of the discussion are unknown, but Gaston allowed the English free passage, arranged provisions, allowed his men to join the Black Prince's army and provided guides. The weather was bad, and the going difficult; the army again forded the Garonne and Ari√®ge in flood, to the amazement of locals. Numerous towns not belonging to Gaston were looted and burnt. The French were initially quiescent as the English swung wide to the south of Toulouse, but James of Bourbon persuaded John of Armagnac to lead the French army south west from Toulouse on 18 November in an attempt to cut off the English. They hoped to turn back the English at the River Save, in eastern Armagnac, and so strand them in French territory. The two advance guards met in a fierce clash on 20 November; the French were defeated and they retreated. The English followed and camped close to the French on the 22nd, in formation, anticipating a battle the next day, but the numerically superior French withdrew during the night. The English headed directly for Gascony, following a different route to that of six weeks earlier. The marching was hard and water was short in places, causing an increase in deaths among the horses. On 28 November the English crossed the border of Gascony, and many Gascons left at this point. The balance of the army returned to La R√©ole on 2 December, having marched ; the Black Prince and his entourage moved on to Bordeaux on the 9th. Effect Contemporary accounts agree the chevauch√©e left immense destruction in its wake, and that an enormous amount of booty was seized; according to one account, English soldiers jettisoned the silver they had looted, in order to be able to carry all the gold and jewellery available. It was reported that the formal booty took 1,000 carts to transport; a gross exaggeration, but indicative of the impression the amount of loot seized made on contemporaries. The French knights and merchants captured were ransomed. While no territory was captured, enormous economic damage was done to France. Carcassonne alone generated more tax than seven entire provinces combined. The four main cities burnt down alone paid for 1,000 men-at-arms and generated an additional 100,000 √©cu in tax each year; if unadulterated this would be approximately half a tonne (0.5 tons) of silver, or two per cent of the French Crown's annual income. It was estimated that the towns destroyed generated a total of 400,000 √©cu annually in war taxes. All were subsequently given considerable tax exemptions and trade privileges for many years. For example, the town of Avignonet was exempted from war taxes for seven years. In addition, 500 villages were destroyed. The modern historian Clifford Rogers concluded that \\"the importance of the economic attrition of the chevauch√©e can hardly be exaggerated.\\" As well as the direct financial effects, towns throughout the south of France looked to their defences, spending large amounts over several years on building or repairing fortifications, and being much less willing to let troops raised locally serve away from home. Contemporaries, including the Black Prince, considered the chevauch√©e to have been as successful in non-financial terms as in financial, itemising the punishment of minor lords who had switched sides to the French; the persuasion of local magnates, especially Gaston of Foix, to move towards the English; the securing of Gascony against attack from the south; and the establishment of a moral ascendancy over the French forces. All this had been achieved during the Black Prince's first independent command and with almost no losses among the Anglo-Gascons. Aftermath The majority of the Gascon troops involved in the chevauch√©e dispersed to their homes for winter. After a three-week break and an enthusiastic celebration of Christmas the English force, plus a small number of Gascons, was divided into four groups and resumed the offensive. French morale was low, and the lack of money for wages kept garrisons small. More than 50 French-held towns or fortifications were captured during the following four months, including strategically important towns close to the borders of Gascony, and others over away. Armagnac put John of Boucicaut in charge of defending this front over the winter, but as he had only 600 men he felt there was little he could do. Other, local, French commanders felt similarly under-resourced and attempted no countermeasures. Several members of the local French nobility went over to the English; the Black Prince received homage from them on 24 April 1356. Reinforcements of men and horses and supplies of food and materiel arrived from England during the spring, and at the start of August 1356 the Black Prince headed north on another chevauch√©e with an Anglo-Gascon force of 6,000. He penetrated as far as the Loire, then withdrew, pursued by the main French army, 11,000 strong, under John II. The English were forced to battle at Poitiers, where they decisively defeated the French and captured John II.

In addition to changing her format, Pousette-Dart softened her expressionistic tendencies, instead adopting delicate washes and nuanced variations in hue and tone; Art in America's Robert Edelman wrote that the washes hovered above and activated her surfaces to create spatial complexity and an effect of \\"quietude with an inner turbulence.\\" For example, Gold Diptych (1994) featured one gently curved canvas atop another larger one, their interaction enhanced by a palette of metallic gold, earth tones, low-key ochres and green-golds, with washes of blue, violet and silver. Green Diptych (1994‚Äì5) inverted the spatial relationship and mingles deep warm and cool greens that lighten at the edges with centers of swirling circular brushstrokes that suggest empty vessels or voids; New York Times critic Pepe Karmel wrote that this work ‚Äúreveals a subliminal affinity with Gorky and de Kooning,\\" and likened it to \\"a landscape lifted into the sky.\\" =Mature shaped canvasses (2003‚Äì )= Pousette-Dart's mature shaped canvasses were first exhibited in New York in shows at Charles Cowles (2004), MoMA PS1 (2007) and Moti Hasson (2008).Corwin, William. \\"Top Ten Shows in New York October Through January,\\" Saatchi Online Magazine, October 15, 2008. They feature configurations of curved panels with interior forms that can evoke both natural and manmade forms. These shapes are sometimes likened to objects such as canoes, boat hull and windshields, or the art of Northwest Coast indigenous peoples, but derive from her earlier hemisphere shapes, in elongated and compressed form. The paintings generally feature two or three interlocking or nesting planes, conjoined horizontally and stacked large-to-small or small-to-large, whose dynamic arrangement suggests a world never fully at rest (e.g., Untitled (Ca√±ones #3), 2007‚Äì8).Rhodes, David. \\"Shaped Canvases and Broken Rules: Shapeshifters, Luhring Augustine,\\" artcritical, July 15, 2016.

She furthers these effects with her use of thinly applied, subtly modulating colors within shapes and across panels‚Äîlight to dark or warm to cool‚Äîwhich suggest a relationship between light and form associated with the natural world rather than formalist or decorative concerns (e.g., Plateau, 2019).Karmel, Pepe. \\"The Golden Age of Abstraction: Right Now,\\" ARTnews, April 24, 2013.

It was first introduced in the 2018-2019 Union budget of India, and has been allocated Rs 500 crores to promote farmer producers' organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management. Introduction & Objectives The operation was first introduced by the Finance Minister of India, Arun Jaitley while presenting the 2018-2019 Union budget. It intended to stabilise the supply of tomatoes, onions and potato crops. Union Minister, Harsimrat Kaur Badal has stated that \\"price volatility of TOP crops wreaks havoc in the households of this country\\" and that \\"we have decided the strategy to stabilise prices of TOP crops and to make sure that TOP crops reach all households in the country round the year\\". TOP crops are considered a regular food commodity across India, but production declined in 2017-18 compared to the previous year despite a 4.5% increase on overall horticulture production. In an attempt to increase and stabilise the production of these crops, Operation Greens was introduced with the following objectives: The operation aims to replicate the success of the increase in production of milk in India through the implementation of Operation Flood. The operation will also aid in India's goal of doubling farmer's income by the year 2022. Strategy The strategy to meeting the objectives has been split into two components: short term price stabilisation measures and long term integrated value chain development projects. = Short term price stabilisation measures = The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India is the principal agency placed in charge of implementing the price stabilisation measures. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries will be providing 50% of the subsidy for: * the transportation of TOP crops from farms to storage centres. * the hiring of storage facilities for use by TOP crops. As part of price stabilisation measures, if prices fall below preceding 3-years average market price at the time of harvest, the evacuation of surplus production from the producing area to consumption centres will be undertaken. A dedicated agency will also be formed to monitor market intelligence, provide demand forecasts and be an advisory to farmers on future prices in relation to TOP crops in order to monitor the supply scenario and implement timely market intervention where necessary. These measures have been put in place in the hopes that by subsidising the costs, farmers will be able to turn a higher profit. When the production of such crops increase, prices collapse and farmers do not have enough storage capacity and links to organised retailing is small. As such, farmers generally get paid only a quarter of what consumers pay. The aim is to increase profits for the farmers by reducing losses post- harvest in the hope that this will stabilise the supply of crops. = Long term integrated value chain development projects = The long term integrated value chain development projects are: * capacity building of FPOs - formation of new FPOs, subject to a maximum limit of 5% of the total eligible project cost. * quality production - provision for quality input such as seeds, setting up of protected cultivation, mechanisation of farm practises and promoting contract farming. * post-harvest processing facilities - providing appropriate transportation infrastructure from farm to facility, as well as primary and secondary processing. * agri-logistics - allow for infrastructure to check for sudden spikes in prices, as well as providing the infrastructure of storage facilities for various regions. * marketing and consumption points - the creation of e-markets and setting up of retail outlets and sorting, grading and packaging facilities. * creation and management of an e-platform for managing the demand and supply of TOP crops. The aim of these projects is to reduce the post-harvest losses through the development of infrastructure which can be used by farmers long-term. Farmers in production clusters will be organised into FPOs to manage production, post-harvest activities, value addition and marketing of TOP produce. Pattern of Assistance The project includes grants at 50% of eligible project costs in all areas and 70% for FPOs, however, it is capped at a maximum of Rs 50 crores per project.

Josephson, 21, had ordered an Uber and mistakenly entered a car that she thought was her ride. The alleged driver is accused of using childproof locks to prevent Josephson from leaving the vehicle and kidnapping and murdering her, leaving her body 65 miles from the starting point in Columbia, South Carolina. A suspect has been arrested and charged with kidnapping and murdering Josephson. The murder led to the passage of Sami‚Äôs Law in New Jersey, which enhances protections for drivers and passengers using Ride Share services. Legislation at the federal level is pending as well. Victim Samantha \\"Sami\\" Josephson was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Seymour and Marci Josephson and grew up in Robbinsville, New Jersey. She attended the University of South Carolina where she majored in political science. Josephson, who as a senior in college at the time of her death, planned on graduating in 2019, and attending Drexel University School of Law. She earned a full scholarship to Drexel University, as well as a partial scholarship to Rutgers and aspired to practice international law. Josephson, a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority, studied abroad in Barcelona and visited Madrid and Paris during her time at USC. Josephson was Jewish and is buried at the Perrineville Jewish Cemetery in Perrineville, New Jersey. Murder Josephson spent the night before her death in the Five Points district in downtown Columbia with friends. At about 2:00 am she decided to leave and ordered an Uber. According to surveillance footage, at 2:09, a black Chevrolet Impala pulled up beside her. Josephson entered the vehicle believing it to be the Uber she had called. When police found the car, the vehicle‚Äôs child locks were activated. It is believed that this was done to prevent Josephson from escaping. She suffered sharp force injuries to her head, neck, face, upper body, leg, and foot. Investigation Josephson's roommates became concerned and reported her missing the day after she accidentally entered the vehicle. Her body was then found in a field in the town of New Zion in Clarendon County by turkey hunters fourteen hours after the alleged kidnapping. According to police, the area where Josephson's body was located is where the suspect recently resided. An autopsy showed that she died of multiple sharp force injuries. Suspect Nathaniel Rowland was seen by police driving a car that matched the description of the one Josephson was seen entering in the surveillance video. When the suspect, who was driving around the Five Points area where Josephson was allegedly kidnapped, was pulled over he got out of the car and ran away. He was caught and was arrested at 3:00 AM on March 30. Inside the car, police found a container of liquid bleach, germicidal wipes, and window cleaner. The car also contained Josephson's phone as well as a large amount of her blood, which was in the passenger seat and in the trunk. Additionally, the child locks were activated, which police believe prevented Josephson from escaping. The suspect was charged with kidnapping, murder, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime. In addition to Josephson‚Äôs murder, the suspect is alleged to have sold items that were stolen from a woman during a kidnapping in Columbia. The alleged victim was carjacked by 2 men while at a traffic light on October 19, 2018. The carjackers allegedly physically assaulted the victim and then forced her to drive to an ATM where they robbed her of money, before forcing her to drive to her home where they again robbed her of items including a Playstation 4. According to Richland County deputies, hours after the alleged kidnapping Rowland sold some of the items stolen from the woman, including the Playstation 4, at a pawn shop. Rowland was charged with obtaining goods under false premises. Legacy After their daughter's death, Josephson's parents established the What's My Name Foundation. The foundation works to educate people about ride-share safety, along with supporting charitable foundations and awarding college scholarships.https://www.whatsmyname.org/foundation Josephson's parents have worked with lawmakers to advocate for policies that enhance safety for ride- share passengers. Several laws have been enacted since Josephson's death. On June 5, 2019, the Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act was signed into law in South Carolina. The act requires ride-share vehicles to display license plate numbers on the front. The law also subjects people who misrepresent themselves as authorized Transportation Network Company (TNC) drivers to a maximum $500 fine and those who use TNC ride-sharing application in the furtherance of criminal activity to a maximum $1,000 fine. In addition to facing fines, one guilty of misrepresenting themselves as an authorized TNC driver may be incarcerated for up to 30 days while one who uses ride-sharing in the furtherance of criminal activity may be face up to 2 years of incarceration.https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess123_2019-2020/bills/4380.htm Also in June 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed Sami's Law, which requires more identification on ride-share vehicles. Specifically, the law requires companies to issue two \\"credential placards\\" to drivers of ride-share vehicles. These placards, which are to be placed on the driver and passenger side back windows, must have the driver's name and photo, along with their license plate number. Ride-share vehicles must also have an identifying marker on the front windshield and back window. Additionally, companies must give ride-share drivers two barcodes that passengers can scan to confirm the driver's identity. Josephson‚Äôs murder prompted lawmakers in North Carolina to propose the Passenger Protection Act. The act requires ride-share drivers to display a printed license plate number on the front of their vehicles and, as of July 1, 2020, to have illuminated signs on their vehicles. The act creates a new criminal penalty for impersonating a ride-share driver and makes assaulting a ride-share driver a misdemeanor. Additionally, it provides $500,000 in grants for colleges to educate students about ride-share safety and creates a study commission to examine ways to improve ride-share safety. The law was signed by Governor Roy Cooper in August 2019. Additional legislation aimed at protecting ride-share users is pending. In April 2019, Senator Anna Kaplan introduced the Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act, to the New York Senate. The act, which is currently in the Transportation Committee,https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s5031 requires ride- share drivers to ‚Äúdisplay visible, consistent, and distinctive signage clearly identifying the rideshare service provider at all times when the driver is active on the service platform or providing rideshare service.‚Äù These signs must be readable from a distance of 50 feet during daylight hours and should be illuminated at night so that the logo is patently visible. Josephson's parents have worked with lawmakers in the United States Congress to craft a federal law to enhance ride-share safety. The bill, which is also titled \\"Sami's Law,\\" was introduced on June 13, 2019. It requires ride-share vehicles to have front license plates and illuminated windshield signs along with scannable or quick-response codes on the sides. States that do not comply would be penalized by losing 1% of federal highway funding. The law would also establish a 15-member advisory council, called SAMI's Council, which would be made of federal agency and public stakeholders. The Council would report to the Secretary of Transportation and work to advance safety standards in the rideshare industry. The bill would also make it unlawful to sell ride-share language, require a Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on incidents of assault and abuse of passengers and drivers, and require the GAO to examine the nature and specifics of background checks that are conducted by companies and the state standards of background checks. The federal Sami's Law was referred to several subcommittees and in July 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved it. Josephson's death promoted the University of South Carolina to launch a campaign titled \\"What's My Name\\" to help students stay safe while using ride-sharing services. Josephson was awarded a posthumous political science degree in May 2019 at what would have been her graduation ceremony.

The stems are made up of somewhat triangular segments, long and up to wide. It has very small areoles that are without spines. The flowers are bright yellow, long. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1935, as Rhipsalis epiphylloides. It was transferred to the genus Hatiora in 1983. The generic boundaries within the tribe to which it belongs, Rhipsalideae, have long been unclear. On the basis of a molecular phylogenetic study in 2011, the species was transferred to the genus Schlumbergera. Since the name \\"Schlumbergera epiphylloides\\" had already been used for a different species, Calvente and Zappi published the replacement name Schlumbergera lutea.
