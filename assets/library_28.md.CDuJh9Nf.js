It is the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God, thus used for introducing spirituality. This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.Ek Omkaar Satnam Audio Discourse  Gurmukhi  Simran is a commonly used term as a verb in Gurmukhi, which refers to 'meditating' of the NƒÅm, or name, of God. Sikhism is a distinct faith, whereby God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals by priests or other intermediaries. It says in the Guru Granth Sahib that through Simran one is purified and attains salvation or 'mukti'. This is because 'si-mar' means 'to die over', thus indicating to death of ego, allowing truth ultimate truth or sat to appear. On page 202 of the Guru Granth Sahib, Guruji writes: This hymn teaches a person who wishes to gain from this human life, one must attain a higher spiritual state by become free of attachment by realizing that all that is, is empty. Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and ultimate truth to the person who earnestly seeks it: Guru Ram Das says in Sarang ki var (Guru Granth Sahib, 1242):  Sant Mat  In Sant Mat the word Simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it,Simran What it means and its uses, by Kirpal Singh. however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due to breaking out of monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only until the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.

It is a resident breeder from Pakistan and India to south China and southeast Asia. It was formerly included in the tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava), resident in Africa south of the Sahara. The two are now usually considered to be separate species. Description These 13‚Äì14-cm long warblers have short rounded wings, a longish tail, strong legs and a short black bill. In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with a short white supercilium and rufous fringes on the closed wings. The underparts are whitish-buff. The sexes are identical. In winter, the upperparts are a warmer brown, and the underparts more buff. The tail is longer than in summer. There are a number of races differing in plumage shade. The endemic race in Sri Lanka retains summer plumage, including the shorter tail, all year round. Biology This skulking passerine bird is typically found in wet lowland grassland, open woodland, scrub and sometimes gardens. The plain prinia builds its nest in a shrub or tall grass and lays three to six eggs. (The tawny- flanked prinia nests in herbage and lays two to four eggs.) Like most warblers, the plain prinia is insectivorous. The song is a repetitive '.

It has roughly 2,400 undergraduate and 100 graduate students, about equally split between male and female. Though St. Lawrence today is non-denominational, it was founded in 1856 by leaders of the Universalist Church, who were seeking to establish a seminary west of New England and were enthusiastically courted by the citizens of Canton. The church almost did not place the school in Canton, however, as they felt students might be exposed to too much \\"excitement\\" within the village limits in 1856. The denomination, which has since merged with the Unitarian faith, was part of the liberal wing of Protestantism, championing such ideas as critical thinking and gender equality‚Äîattributes that surfaced in the new Theological School of St. Lawrence University, which was progressive in its teaching philosophy and coeducational from the beginning. History Gunnison Memorial Chapel The university as it exists today was created as a \\"Preparatory Department\\" to provide a foundation for theological study. That department became today's liberal arts university, while the seminary closed in 1965 with the Unitarian/Universalist consolidation. Richardson Hall Early in the 20th century, the university's graduate program in education came into being; it has since served hundreds of North Country school teachers and administrators. Following a difficult period during the Great Depression and World War II that included the decision to shut down the Brooklyn Law School, the student population increased quickly, and with it, the physical plant. A four-building campus serving around 300 students in the early 1940s became a 30-building campus serving 2000 students within 25 years, partly through acquisition of the adjacent state school of agriculture campus when that facility relocated across town. The mid-1960s also saw the birth of one of St. Lawrence's nationally known programs: its international programs. In 1974, two early campus buildings, Richardson Hall (1855‚Äì56) and Herring-Cole Hall (1869‚Äì1902), were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1984, structures built before 1930 were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Lawrence University-Old Campus Historic District. During World War II, St. Lawrence University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In the 2000s, the university undertook several construction projects. The campus student center was completed in the spring of 2004 and serves as the school's hub at the center of campus. The Johnson Hall of Science opened in the fall of 2007, and expanded learning and lab space in several science disciplines, notably biology, chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, and psychology. Johnson Hall received LEED Gold certification for its sustainable design; it was the first Gold science building in New York State. Additionally, the Noble Center underwent major renovations to double the space available for the arts. A new Center for Arts Technology opened in January 2007. Admissions For the class of 2022 (enrolled fall 2018), St. Lawrence received 6,458 applications and accepted 2,975 (46.1%). The number enrolling was 643; the yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 21.6%. In terms of class rank, 36% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes; 73% ranked in the top quarter. The average GPA for entering freshmen was 3.55, the average SAT score was 1260, and the average ACT score was 28. The class of 2018 (enrolled fall 2014) included 34.2% from New York State, 56.2% from 31 other states, and 9% international students representing 63 countries. Of the 643 matriculants in 2018, 52% were female, 48% were male. Academics Marie Curie dedicates Hepburn Hall of Chemistry Louvain (Belgium) university library. Commemorates the financial support received from St. Lawrence University (among many others) to rebuild the library after its destruction by fire in 1914. Majors and programs In total there are 40 majors available and 36 minors. St. Lawrence has 3+2 engineering programs run jointly with five other colleges, and a 4+1 MBA at Clarkson University. Students are also free to take classes at nearby Clarkson University, SUNY Potsdam, and SUNY Canton. International studies St. Lawrence offers international programs in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Nepal, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Trinidad and Tobago. In addition, the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) allows students to study at any of over 100 universities on six continents. In the U.S., students can study at The Washington Center https://twc.edu/ in Washington, D.C., in New York City, in the Adirondack State Park, or at Fisk University, a distinguished, historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee. Hepburn Hall Libraries Herring-Cole Hall, the university's earliest library The Owen D. Young Library (ODY) is a spacious research environment offering a multilevel facility of , characterized by an abundance of natural light and a variety of seating for individual and group study. A six-million-dollar renovation of the library was recently completed; the renovations prepare ODY for the twenty- first century. It includes more than 500,000 volumes, over 370,000 government documents, 1986 periodicals, 550,000 microtext units, recipient of 10,000 to 20,000 reports and documents annually and access to over 70 databases through Internet. In addition to ODY, which houses the college's major collections in the social sciences and humanities, the J. Harold and Ruth C. Launders Science Library opened in January 1994. Home of the major science and technology collections at St. Lawrence, the Launders Science Library occupies the upper two floors of Madill Hall, and triples the space available for science resources and services. The library's collection of primary scholarly resources may be viewed and used in the Frank and Anne Piskor Special Collections Reading Room, located directly across the atrium from the main entrance of ODY. Each semester the special collections staff offer instruction to classes from a variety of academic departments and programs, including fine arts, French, English, history, environmental studies, economics and the outdoor studies program. In addition, the special collections program includes a book arts collection and a laboratory press. Highlights of St. Lawrence's special collections include the William Rose Benet Collection of American Poetry, the Milburn Collection of Hawthorniana, the Edwin Arlington Robinson Collection, and the Frank P. Piskor Collection on Robert Frost. Other special collections include manuscripts devoted to Frederic Remington, the Adirondacks, the St. Lawrence Seaway and other aspects of northern New York history. Campus life Arts and cultural offerings The opportunities described below are augmented by frequent concerts, exhibits, performances and shows provided by outside performers. Music The music department supports three vocal and two instrumental ensembles. Laurentian Singers, an undergraduate chorus that tours each spring, University Chorus and the Early Music Singers provide vocal opportunities for St. Lawrence students. Instrumentalists may choose between participation in the String Orchestra, Concert Band, Improv Lab, Early Music Ensemble and Special Productions. The Early Music Ensemble uses the Emily Romer Collection of medieval and Renaissance instruments to perform music of the 12th through 18th centuries. Each semester the department offers a Special Production, focusing on a particular repertory. Recent productions have included a Latin Dance Party, Music for Louis XIV and Traditional Irish Music. Private instruction is available in voice and on keyboard, guitar, brass, woodwinds and strings. Three informal student-directed collegiate a cappella groups, The Saints, The Sinners, and The Upbeats are active both on and off campus. Most students that participate in the Music Ensembles are not Music Majors, but rather have a strong interest in pursuing their musical capabilities. St. Lawrence University is also home to the Java Barn, an on-campus music venue run by a dedicated group of SLU students. The Java Barn hosts live bands every weekend; shows are open to all SLU students and admission is free. Theatre The Performance and Communication Arts (PCA) department stages annual faculty- directed productions in Gulick Theater, a proscenium theater seating 511. In addition, the flexible 85- to 100-seat Edison Miles Theater (better known as the Black Box) is used for experimental and student productions. Guest artist workshops that address all aspects of theater are offered for interested students. Though some production work is associated with classes, for many productions it is not necessary to be a major, or even currently enrolled in (PCA) classes, to participate. Art The university art collection contains nearly 7,000 objects that are frequently displayed in the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery or used for tours and classroom discussions. While the collection dates to the university's founding, its most vital growth has taken place in recent years. Twentieth-century works on paper, such as photographs, prints, drawings and portfolios, are the strength of the collection. Paintings and sculptures by Frank Stella, George Segal, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi, Milton Avery and Frederic Remington are among the collection's highlights. Activities Bob Dylan performing at St. Lawrence University in November 1963 St. Lawrence hosts more than 100 student activities groups. St. Lawrence is home to the second oldest collegiate outing club in the nation (next to only Dartmouth College). The club annually sends students to climb all 46 peaks over of the Adirondacks during \\"Peak Weekend\\". Peak Weekend has recently celebrated its 25th anniversary at St. Lawrence. The Outing Club also has its own residence on campus and is part of the Theme Cottages. The club frequently sponsors trips for skiing, hiking, rafting and other outdoor activities. Established in 1993 as a student-run coffeehouse, the Java Barn is a well- known venue among touring bands on the East Coast. In 2006 the music venue moved to the former Winning Health Center. In the fall of 2010, Java was moved once again to an area between The Student Center and Admissions Building. Java now occupies a former storage garage, with bright student-created murals spattering the walls. The Student Government is also very active on campus. The Thelomathesian Society was founded in 1863 by Vasco P. Abbott who became its first President. The Thelomathesian Society, or Thelmo as it is often called, serves as the governing body of the St. Lawrence University Student Body, and is a forum for students to voice their opinions on issues presented by the Administration, Faculty, and Student Body. Thelmo debates and votes on a wide variety of issues, ranging from university policies to St. Lawrence University Student Activities Funding (SLUSAF) requests for different campus groups and organizations Theme Cottages are a popular housing option at St. Lawrence. The Women's Resource Center was founded to raise awareness of gender issues on and off campus. WRC members, or \\"Dub Girls\\", are trained as sexual assault victim advocates and create education programs to promote safe sexual practices. The Black Student Union and La Casa Latina houses both celebrate racial diversity by exemplifying racially diverse living. The Artists' Guild is a house that focuses on supporting and appreciating the visual arts. Commons College residents focus on charity fund-raising and building a living- learning experience through a house-shared course each semester. The H.O.P.E. (Helping Out People Everywhere) house focuses on community service, as the name suggests. The Java House is the living space for the students who run the campus's concert venue, the Java Barn. The L.I.G.H.T. (Living Inspirationally Growing Healthy Together) House is a theme house where students work to promote a healthy lifestyle centered on balance and self-awareness. The Outing Club House provides a living space for those who are highly involved in the campus's historic Outing Club. The Arts Annex is a space for students who strive for appreciation and support of the arts. Students living in the Arts Annex are members of the St. Lawrence University Performing Arts Collaborative (SLUPAC), and also work closely with TAUNY (Traditional Arts in Upstate New York), a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting, preserving and promoting the traditional folk arts and folklore of New York's North Country. Together, TAUNY and the students of the Arts Annex/SLUPAC work to help sustain a variety of arts throughout the North Country. The Campus Kitchens house is a space allotted for students who partake in St. Lawrence's chapter of the national organization, The Campus Kitchens Project. Students of Campus Kitchens work to cook hot meals for disadvantaged community members by utilizing donated food, by repurposing leftover campus food, and by using food grown on campus itself. The group also packs bagged lunches, which they call \\"Bear Packs,\\" for disadvantaged Canton schoolchildren. The Greenhouse is home to many environmentally conscious students. Students in the Greenhouse live in an environmentally responsible manner, and provide weekly, healthy, locally sourced dinners. The Habitat for Humanity theme cottage houses students that actively work with the local chapter and national office of Habitat for Humanity. There is also a technology-centric theme house, The Hub, which provides gaming and technology events to the campus. The Greek System now consists of four sororities and two fraternity chapters. In 1997 the school had five sororities and seven fraternities. The current state of Greek participation levels are substantially lower than in past years, due in part to liability issues and national chapter concerns over various alcohol and code violations. However the remaining chapters still have an active role in campus life.

Students are required to live in university residence halls, theme cottages or Greek chapter houses during each semester at the university. Each residential area has a residential coordinator (RC) who provide supervision, leadership and support for the residents in their units and perform administrative duties pertaining to their buildings. Community assistants (CA) are undergraduate students who assist RCs. The First-Year Program (FYP) A unique requirement of St. Lawrence's curriculum is the First Year Program. St. Lawrence's first-Year Program is one of the oldest living-learning programs in the country, helping students make successful transitions from high school to college, intellectually and socially, since 1987. Students live together and study in a team-taught FYP, developing the writing, speaking, and research skills needed for college. They continue to develop these skills in a spring First-Year Seminar.https://www.stlawu.edu/fyp All first-year students live in residential colleges of the FYP. These are buildings or wings of buildings where approximately 30 students live together and enroll in a common course. A professional RC and upperclass CAs provide supervision. Upperclass Residential Program All upperclass students live in one of four housing options: residence halls, cottages, Greek chapter houses, or the senior townhouses. The majority of upperclass students live in residence halls, where most floors are coeducational. Singles, doubles, triples and quads are available and there are suites in a two-building complex. Room assignments are made on a class year priority. Theme suites and cottages are available for groups with special common interests. Groups must apply in the spring semester for the following year.

The story follows Jane, a changeling girl who slaves at a dragon factory in the world of Faerie, building part-magical, part-cybernetic monsters that are used as jet fighters. The plot of her story takes the form of a spiral, with events and characters constantly recurring in new settings. The novel constantly subverts fantasy tropes and archetypes. Swanwick admits having written it both as a homage to J.R.R. Tolkien and in reaction to a handful of writers he claims exploit Tolkien's milieu and the readers' imaginations with derivative, commercial fantasy: The dragon Melanchthon is named after German theologian Philipp Melanchthon, an associate of Martin Luther. Further references to Lutheranism can be found in Swanwick's novel Jack Faust. Swanwick has written two other books in the same setting, entitled The Dragons of Babel (published in 2008) and The Iron Dragon's Mother (published in 2019). Excerpts from The Dragons of Babel have periodically been published as short stories. They include King Dragon, The Word that Sings the Scythe, An Episode of Stardust, A Small Room in Koboldtown and Lord Weary's Empire. Most of these were originally published in Asimov's Science Fiction.  Synopsis  The first portion of the story concerns Jane's childhood in a factory that builds iron dragons. Jane and her close friend Rooster, whose true name is Tetigistus, work in a group of indentured child laborers. Jane steals a grimoire, and after reading it, begins to hear the voice of an iron dragon in her head. Jane is taken to entertain an elderly, silent elf called the Baldwynn, but is told not to return after she witnesses a strange phenomenon. The dragon manipulates Rooster into trying to escape, but Rooster dies in the attempt. A distraught Jane forces the dragon to tell her his true name, Melanchthon. They then flee the factory. Later, Jane attends high school while fixing a dormant Melanchthon, who was damaged in their escape. She discovers that the school principal is none other than the Baldwynn and becomes friends with her classmate Peter and his girlfriend Gwen, who, as the wicker queen, will soon be burned alive as a sacrifice to the Goddess. To Jane's shock, Peter tells her that his true name is Tetigistus. They confess their love and sleep together. Soon after, Gwen is sacrificed and Peter commits suicide out of guilt. Melanchthon disappears and Jane realizes that his manipulation caused these events. Next, Jane goes to college to study alchemy. She makes new friends: Sirin, a talented alchemist, and Puck Aleshire, to whom she is strangely drawn. Jane discovers that Puck has the same soul as Peter and Rooster did: Tetigistus. She also suspects that Sirin might have the same soul as Gwen. Soon after, the Teind arrives, a night of chaos during which both Sirin and Puck die. Jane reunites with Melanchthon, who shows her that her life constantly spirals around to the same failures and reveals his ultimate plan to destroy the universe. Feeling her existence is futile, Jane agrees to help him. Jane becomes a minor celebrity and serial killer, using the bodies of her victims as fuel for Melanchthon. She meets a dragon pilot named Rocket, who she realizes is another Tetigistus, and his half-sister Fata Incolore, true name Kunosoura, who shares a soul with Sirin and Gwen. Jane also encounters the Baldwynn, who shows her that her body in the human world is confined to a mental institution. After Jane sleeps with Rocket, she and Melanchthon enact their plan to destroy the universe. Rocket pursues them in his own dragon, and Jane is forced to blast him away, killing Tetigistus yet again. As they approach Spiral Castle, the center of the universe, Melanchthon dissolves around Jane and she realizes that their plan was doomed from the start. Jane finds herself in Spiral Castle with the Baldwynn, who reveals that he's one of the Goddess's consorts and takes Jane to see her. The Goddess berates Jane for squandering the gift of her connection with Tetigistus and Kunosoura through her selfishness, causing Jane to have an existential crisis. Afterwards, Jane is returned to the mortal world, unsure of whether or not she is being punished. She is released from the mental institution and goes on to obtain a doctorate in chemistry. While attending a party with a friend, Jane glimpses a man to whom she is instantly and desperately drawn. The novel ends, leaving it uncertain if Jane has finally reunited with Tetigistus and found a chance at redemption.  Tone  Much of the novel is nihilistic in tone. Jane encounters Tetigistus and Kunosoura several times, and each time prioritizes her own survival, resulting in their deaths. She also fails to remain a moral protagonist, becoming a manipulative thief who is willing to kill to accomplish her goals. Melanchthon embodies nihilism and atheism, telling Jane that the Goddess is a myth and that the world comes to nothing: > Life exists, and all who live are born to suffer. The best moments are > fleeting and bought with the coin of exquisite torment. All attachments end. > All loved ones die. All that you value passes away. In such a vexatious > existence laughter is madness and joy is folly. Shall we accept that it all > happens for no reason, with no cause? That there is nobody to blame but > ourselves but that accepting the responsibility is pointless for doing so > cannot ease, defer, or deaden the pain? Not likely! It is so much more > comforting to erect a straw figure on which to blame it all. However, the novel ends on a cautiously optimistic note. Jane's encounter with the Goddess reveals that, in truth, there is order to the universe and that, though she squandered it, Jane did have a destiny. However, she refuses to answer Jane's questions on why the world is painful, whether choice is an illusion, and what the Goddess wants. Despite this, Jane comes to realize the Goddess's love for her and that her life in the human world \\"[is] not punishment.\\" The final suggestion that Jane may be reunited with Tetigistus suggests that the Goddess has forgiven Jane and given her another chance to fulfill her purpose.  Themes  Blood sacrifice is a constant presence in The Iron Dragon's Daughter. Two prominent examples are the sacrifice of the wicker queen, who is burned alive on Samhain, and the Teind, which claims one tenth of the students at Jane's university. It is never made clear whether or not these traditions are necessary to appease the Goddess. Other instances include the bodies of men being sacrificed to Melanchthon's hunger and the repeated sacrifice of Tetigistus's life in service of Jane's goals. Materialism and consumerism also pervade the novel. The Faerie world is populated with familiar structures, including malls, from which Jane learns to shoplift. Throughout the novel, common material items are juxtaposed with mythological beings. As the wicker queen, Gwen becomes a celebrity, indulging in drugs and a lavish lifestyle before her death is broadcast as a live TV special. Jane observes a society of minuscule, ant-like creatures called meryons gradually grow from an agricultural bliss to a dystopia where the rich are protected and \\"tiny enemies of the state\\" are executed. When characters are injured or dreaming, they often spout off phrases that seem pulled from an advertisement. For example when Rooster is in a coma during the opening of the novel: > Rooster groaned In a high, lucid voice, he said \\"Two all-beef patties, > special sauce, lettuce, cheese...\\" Jane found herself unable to breathe. > \\"... and a sesame seed bun.\\" It was too awful, his lonely voice speaking to > no one in the emptiness of the night. \\"Teflon.\\" Finally, virginity and the lack thereof are often addressed. Virginity seems required for many functions in the Faerie world. While Jane can pilot Melanchthon after she has lost her virginity, she cannot repair him, as the touch of a non-virgin will burn his wiring. Though the wicker queen need not remain a virgin, her consort is required to do so. When Peter and Jane have sex, he is rendered unable to perform his part of the sacrifice and must be replaced, to his shame. However, sex and sexuality also hold great power in The Iron Dragon's Daughter. While at university, Jane learns to use esoteric sex rituals for magical and alchemical purposes. Through these rituals, she is able to make a variety of discoveries and speak to her human mother in visions. Jane also uses her sexuality as a source of power in interpersonal relationships. Author's comments In a 2017 interview, Swanwick said: \\"The immediate inspiration for Melanchthon was the fact that in the wake of Anne McCaffrey, the default setting for dragons became them being lovable, wonderful creatures that made the best of friends. I thought the loss of the traditional Western dragon as a figure of terror was deplorable. So I set about rectifying the situation. But the inspiration behind that was the way that writers tend to soft-pedal evil, to make excuses for it. I‚Äôve seen enough evil that I refuse to cut it any slack. The problem with tropes is that so many of them are lies. Nobody who‚Äôs ever stood in a hospital waiting room praying in vain for a friend to live can believe that things always work out for the best. That‚Äôs why I include so many ‚Äúgross‚Äù things in my novels ‚Äì because they exist in real life. And yet, life is good. A novel that acknowledges the darkness and yet expresses the joy of living is one that aspires to the status of literature. Jane, you have to remember, doesn‚Äôt belong in Faerie. So, try though she does, over and over, there‚Äôs no way she can make a place for herself there. As for the high mortality rate among her boyfriends‚Ä¶ When the novel was half-written, my wife, Marianne Porter, remarked, ‚ÄúJane is a spy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHer thoughts and motives are as opaque to everyone in Faerie as theirs are to her. She baffles them. That‚Äôs why she spreads chaos wherever she goes.‚Äù Jane doesn‚Äôt intend chaos. But being who and where she is, it naturally follows. As for the high mortality rate among Jane‚Äôs beaus‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs just symptomatic of the fact that she‚Äôs trapped in a world where she doesn‚Äôt belong. Nothing can ever work out well for her.\\" Interview with Swaneick, 2017, accessed 10/13/19  Reception  The Iron Dragon's Daughter was lauded for its upheaval of fantasy tropes and its inventive style and narrative. Critic John Clute called the book an \\"anti-fantasy\\" and Kirkus described it as \\"seething, brain-bursting, all but indescribable.\\" The novel was nominated for the Arthur C.

It was published by Broderbund for the Commodore 64 in 1984. The Commodore 64 version was published in the UK by Ariolasoft. The game inspired Wright to develop SimCity. Gameplay Commodore 64 screenshot Raid on Bungeling Bay is a 2D shoot 'em up. The player controls a helicopter launched from an aircraft carrier to bomb six factories scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the Bungeling Empire (frequent villains in Broderbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by gun turrets, fighter jets, guided missiles, and a battleship. There is also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure means that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet Earth. Players have to attack its infrastructure while defending the aircraft carrier which serves as home base. The game offers an insight into the design style of Wright, who also designed SimCity. Over time, the factories grow and develop new technologies to use against the player. There are also visible signs of interdependency among the islands, such as supply boats moving between them. In order to win the game, the player must prevent the escalation by bombing all the factories as quickly as possible, keeping them from advancing their technology. If left alone for too long, the factories create enough new weaponry to overwhelm the player. Ports Raid on Bungeling Bay was ported to the Famicom/NES by Hudson Soft. Hudson published this version and released it in Japan on February 15, 1985. A conversion for the arcade-based VS. System was created based on this port, and it was distributed to arcades by Nintendo. An MSX version was developed by Zap and published by Sony. The Japanese releases of the game are alternatively titled . Will Wright stated in an interview that he was not sure if the arcade version was actually released in the United States. Reception Raid on Bungeling Bay for the Commodore 64 sold about 20,000 to 30,000 units in the US, while the NES version sold about a million units in Japan. The large discrepancy was attributed to lack of software piracy on the NES due to its cartridge system along with Raid being one of the first American games published in Japan. Sales of the game gave Will Wright the financial freedom to create SimCity. Compute! wrote in 1985 that Raid \\"possesses all the virtues needed to appease the demanding gamer\\", with \\"amazingly detailed\\" graphics. Computer Gaming World in 1988 approved of the Nintendo version's graphics, calling it a \\"high adventure with realistic overtones\\" that did not involve dragons or elves. The magazine named it the Action-Strategy Game of the Year for Nintendo, writing that Raid had been \\"rescued from Broderbund's computer software vaults, updated slightly, and sent out to challenge all the bright new [Nintendo games and] blew them out of the water ... a delightful game experience\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Raid on Bungeling Bay the 24th-best computer game ever released. Legacy Wright continued to develop the editor for the game as a personal toy because he enjoyed it so much. He researched urban planning and realised that others might enjoy constructing and building cities themselves. The result was a more advanced simulation that eventually became SimCity.

Alongside the Vickers Wellington and the Handley Page Hampden, the Whitley was developed during the mid-1930s according to Air Ministry Specification B.3/34, which it was subsequently selected to meet. In 1937, the Whitley formally entered into RAF squadron service; it was the first of the three medium bombers to be introduced. Following the outbreak of war in September 1939, the Whitley participated in the first RAF bombing raid upon German territory and remained an integral part of the early British bomber offensive. In 1942 it was superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined \\"heavies\\" such as the Avro Lancaster. Its front line service included maritime reconnaissance with Coastal Command and the second line roles of glider-tug, trainer and transport aircraft. The type was also procured by British Overseas Airways Corporation as a civilian freighter aircraft. The aircraft was named after Whitley, a suburb of Coventry, home of one of Armstrong Whitworth's plants. __TOC__ Development Origins Scale comparison diagram of the trio of British twin-engined medium bombers at the outbreak of the Second World War; the Whitley (pink), the Vickers Wellington (blue) and the Handley Page Hampden (yellow) In July 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.3/34, seeking a heavy night bomber/troop transport to replace the Handley Page Heyford biplane bomber.Moyes 1967, p. 3. John Lloyd, the Chief Designer of Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, chose to respond to the specification with a design designated as the AW.38, which later was given the name Whitley after the location of Armstrong Whitworth's main factory. The design of the AW.38 was in fact a development of the Armstrong Whitworth AW.23 bomber-transport design that had lost to the Bristol Bombay for the earlier Specification C.26/31. Lloyd selected the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engine to power the Whitley, which was capable of generating 795 horsepower. One of the more innovative features of the Whitley's design was the adoption of a three-bladed two- position variable-pitch propeller built by de Havilland; the Whitley was the first aircraft to fly with such an arrangement. As Lloyd was unfamiliar with the use of flaps on a large heavy monoplane, they were initially omitted from the design. To compensate, the mid-set wings were set at a high angle of incidence (8.5¬∞) to confer good take-off and landing performance. Although flaps were included late in the design stage, the wing remained unaltered; as a result, the Whitley flew with a pronounced nose-down attitude when flown with the wings in the cruising position, resulting in considerable drag. The Whitley holds the distinction of having been the first RAF aircraft with a semi-monocoque fuselage, which was built using a slab-sided structure to ease production. This replaced the tubular construction method traditionally employed by Armstrong Whitworth, who instead constructed the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the semi-monocoque fuselage was a significant advance in design; many Whitleys surviving severe damage on operations. In June 1935, owing to the urgent need to replace biplane heavy bombers then in service with the RAF, a verbal agreement was formed to produce an initial 80 aircraft, 40 being of an early Whitley Mk I standard and the other 40 being more advanced Whitley Mk IIs. Production was initially at three factories in Coventry; fuselages and detailed components were fabricated at Whitley Abbey, panel-beating and much of the detailed work at the former Coventry Ordnance Works factory, while wing fabrication and final assembly took placed at Baginton Aerodrome. During 1935 and 1936, various contracts were placed for the type; the Whitley was ordered \\"off the drawing board\\" - prior to the first flights of any of the prototypes. On 17 March 1936, the first prototype Whitley Mk I, K4586, conducted its maiden flight from Baginton Aerodrome, piloted by Armstrong Whitworth Chief Test Pilot Alan Campbell-Orde. K4586 was powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX 14-cylinder air-cooled aircraft radial engines. The second prototype, K4587, was furnished with a pair of more powerful medium-supercharged Tiger XI engines. The prototypes differed little from the initial production standard aircraft; a total of 34 production Whitley Mk I were completed. Further development After the first 34 aircraft had been completed, the engines were replaced with the more reliable two-speed-supercharged Tiger VIIIs. K7243, the 27th production Whitley, is believed to have served as a prototype following modifications. The resulting aircraft was designated as the Whitley Mk II. A total of 46 production aircraft were completed to the Whitley Mk II standard. One Whitley Mk II, K7243, was used as a test bed for the 1,200 hp 21-cylinder radial Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound engine; on 6 January 1939, K7243 made its first flight with the Deerhound.Moyes 1967, pp. 10-11. Another Whitley Mk I, K7208, was modified to operate with a higher (33,500 lb) gross weight. K7211, the 29th production Whitley, served as the prototype for a further advanced variant of the aircraft, the Whitley Mk III. The Whitley Mk III featured numerous improvements, such as the replacement of the manually operated nose turret with a powered Nash & Thompson turret and a powered retractable twin-gun ventral \\"dustbin\\" turret. The ventral turret was hydraulically-powered but proved to be hard to operate and added considerable drag, thus the Whitley Mk III was the only variant to feature this ventral turret arrangement. Other changes included increased dihedreal of the outer wing panels, superior navigational provisions, and the installation of new bomb racks. A total of 80 Whitley Mk III aircraft were manufactured. While the Tiger VIII engine used in the Whitley Mks II and III was more reliable than those used in early aircraft, the Whitley was re-engined with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in 1938, giving rise to the Whitley Mk IV. Three Whitley Mk I aircraft, K7208, K7209, and K7211, were initially re-engined to serve as prototypes. The new engines are accredited with producing greatly improved performance. Other changes made included the replacement of the manually operated tail and retractable ventral turrets with a Nash & Thompson powered turret equipped with four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, the increasing of fuel tankage capacity, including two additional fuel tanks in the wing. A total of 40 Whitley Mk IV and Whitley Mk IVA, a sub-variant featuring more powerful models of the Merlin engine, were completed. The decision was made to introduce a series of other minor improvements to produce the Whitley Mk V. These included the modification of the tail fins and rudders, the fitting of leading edge de-icers, further fuel capacity increases, a smaller D/F loop in a streamlined fairing being adopted, and the extension of the rear fuselage by 15 in (381 mm) to improve the rear-gunner's field of fire.Moyes 1967, p. 7. The Whitley Mk V was by far the most numerous version of the aircraft, with 1,466 built until production ended in June 1943. The Whitley Mk VII was the final variant to be built. Unlike the other variants, it was developed for service with RAF Coastal Command and was thus furnished for maritime reconnaissance rather than as a general purpose bomber. A single Whitley Mk V, P3949 acted as a prototype for this variant. A total of 146 Whitley Mk VIIs would be produced, additional Whitley Mk V aircraft would be converted to the standard as well. It had a sixth crew member to operate the new ASV Mk 2 radar system along with an increased fuel capacity for long endurance anti-shipping missions. Some Whitley Mk VII were later converted as trainer aircraft, featuring additional seating and instrumentation for flight engineers.Moyes 1967, p. 10. Early marks of the Whitley featured bomb bay doors, fitted on both the fuselage and wing bays, that were held shut by bungee cords; during bombing operations, these were opened by the weight of the bombs as they fell on them and closed again by the bungee cord. The short and unpredictable delay for the doors to open led to highly inaccurate bombing. The Mk.III introduced hydraulically actuated doors which greatly improved bombing accuracy. To aim bombs, the bomb aimer opened a hatch in the nose of the aircraft, which extended the bomb sight out of the fuselage but the Mk IV replaced this hatch with a slightly extended transparent plexiglas panel, improving crew comfort. Design A Browning machine gun being installed in a Whitley's turret, 1940 The Armstrong Whitworth Whitley was a twin-engined heavy bomber, initially being powered by a pair of 795 h.p. Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engines.Moyes 1967, pp. 4-5. More advanced models of the Tiger engine equipped some of the later variants of the Whitley; starting with the Whitley Mk IV variant, the Tigers were replaced by a pair of 1,030 h.p. Rolls-Royce Merlin IV V12 engines.Moyes 1967, pp. 5-6. According to Moyes, the adoption of the Merlin engine gave the Whitley a considerable boost in performance.Moyes 1967, p. 6. The Whitley had a crew of five: a pilot, co- pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a wireless operator and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator sat side by side in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator, his seat mounted on rails and able to pivot, slid backwards and rotated to the left to use the chart table behind him after takeoff. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret.Flight 21 October 1937, p. 402. The offensive armaments were stowed in two bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells in the wing. Other sources state there were 16 \\"cells\\" total: two groups of 2 in the fuselage, and four groups of 3 in the wings, plus two smaller cells for parachute flares in the rear fuselage. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant. The early examples had a nose turret and rear turret, both being manually operated and mounting one Vickers 0.303 machine gun. On the Whitley Mk III this arrangement was substantially revised: a new retractable ventral 'dustbin' position was installed mounting twin .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns and the nose turret was also upgraded to a Nash & Thompson power-operated turret.Moyes 1967, p. 5. On the Whitley Mk IV, the tail and ventral turrets were replaced with a Nash & Thompson power-operated turret mounting four Browning machine guns; upon the adoption of this turret arrangement, the Whitley became the most powerfully armed bomber in the world against attacks from the rear. Paratroopers inside the fuselage of a Whitley, August 1942 The fuselage comprised three sections, with the main frames being riveted with the skin and the intermediate sections being riveted to the inside flanges of the longitudinal stringers. Extensive use of Alclad sheeting was made. Fuel was carried within a total of three tanks, a pair of 182 gallon tanks contained within the leading edge of each outer wing and one 155 gallon tank in the roof of the fuselage, over the spar centersection; two auxiliary fuel tanks could be installed in the front fuselage bomb bay compartment. The inner leading edges contained the oil tanks, which doubled as radiant oil coolers. To ease production, a deliberate effort was made to reduce component count and standardise parts. The fuselage proved to be robust enough to withstand severe damage. The Whitley featured a large rectangular-shaped wing; its appearance led to the aircraft receiving the nickname \\"the flying barn door\\". Like the fuselage, the wings were formed from three sections, being built up around a large box spar with the leading and trailing edges being fixed onto the spar at each rib point.Moyes 1967, pp. 3-4. The forward surfaces of the wings were composed of flush-riveted, smooth and unstressed metal sheeting; the rear 2/3rds aft of the box spar to the trailing edge, as well as the ailerons and split flaps was fabric covered. The inner structure of the split flaps was composed of duralumin and ran between the ailerons and the fuselage, being set at a 15‚Äì20 degree position for taking off and at a 60 degree position during landing.Moyes 1967, p. 4. The tailplanes employed a similar construction to that of the wings, the fins being braced to the fuselage using metal struts the elevators and rudders incorporated servo- balancing trim tabs. Operational history Military service Whitley Mk.V production, 1941 On 9 March 1937, the Whitley Mk I began entering squadron service with No. 10 Squadron of the RAF, replacing their Handley Page Heyford biplanes. In January 1938, the Whitley Mk II first entered squadron service with No. 58 Squadron and in August 1938, the Whitley Mk III first entered service with No. 51 Squadron. In May 1939, the Whitley Mk IV first entered service with No. 10 Squadron and in August 1939, the Whitley Mk IVA first entered service with No. 78 Squadron. By the outbreak of the Second World War, a total of seven squadrons were operational, the majority of these flying Whitley III or IV aircraft, while the Whitley V had only just been introduced to service; a total of 196 Whitleys were on charge with the RAF.Thetford 1957, p. 27. At the start of the war, No. 4 Group, equipped with the Whitley, was the only trained night bomber force in the world. Alongside the Handley Page Hampden and the Vickers Wellington, the Whitley bore the brunt of the early fighting and saw action during the first night of the war, when they dropped propaganda leaflets over Germany.Green and Swanborough Air Enthusiast 1979, p. 22. The propaganda flight made the Whitley the first aircraft of RAF Bomber Command to penetrate into Germany. Further propaganda flights would travel as far as Berlin, Prague, and Warsaw.Moyes 1967, pp. 11-12. On the night of 19/20 March 1940, in conjunction with multiple Hampdens, the Whitley conducted the first bombing raid on German soil, attacking the H√∂rnum seaplane base on the Island of Sylt.Moyes 1967, p. 12. Following the H√∂rnum raid, Whitleys routinely patrolled the Frisian Islands, targeting shipping and seaplane activity. On the night of 11/12 June 1940, the Whitley carried out Operation Haddock, the first RAF bombing raid on Italy, only a few hours after Italy's declaration of war; the Whitleys bombed Turin and Genoa, reaching Northern Italy via a refuelling stop in the Channel Islands. Many leading World War II bomber pilots of the RAF flew Whitleys at some point in their career, including Don Bennett, James Brian Tait, and Leonard Cheshire.Moyes 1967, pp. 12-13. Merlin-powered prototype K7208 (converted Whitley Mk I), circa 1938 Unlike the Hampden and Wellington, which had met Specification B.9/32 for a day bomber, the Whitley was always intended for night operations alone and thus escaped the early heavy losses received during daylight raids carried out upon German shipping. As the oldest of the three bombers, the Whitley was effectively obsolete by the start of the war, yet over 1,000 more aircraft were produced before a suitable replacement was found. A particular problem with the radar-equipped Mk VII, with the addition of the drag-producing aerials, was that it could not maintain altitude on one engine. Whitleys flew a total of 8,996 operations with Bomber Command, dropped 9,845 tons (8,931 tonnes) of bombs, and 269 aircraft were lost in action. On the night of 29/30 April 1942 No. 58 Squadron flying Whitleys bombed the Port of Ostend in Belgium. This was the last operational mission by a Whitley equipped bomber squadron.Moyes 1967, p. 13. In late 1942, the Whitley was retired from service as a frontline aircraft for bomber squadrons and was shifted to other roles. The type continued to operate delivering supplies and agents in the Special Duties squadrons (138 and 161) until December 1942, as well as serving as a transport for troops and freight, a carrier for paratroopers and a tow aircraft for gliders. In 1940, the Whitley had been selected as the standard paratroop transport; in this role, the ventral turret aperture was commonly modified to be used for the egress of paratroopers. No. 100 Group RAF used Whitleys as an airborne platform to carry airborne radar and electronic counter-measures. In February 1942, Whitleys were used to carry the paratroopers who participated in the Bruneval raid, code named Operation Biting, in which German radar technology was captured from a German base on the coast of France.Moyes 1967, pp. 13-14. Long-range Coastal Command Mk VII variants, were among the last Whitleys remaining in front-line service, remaining in service until early 1943. The first U-boat kill attributed to the Whitley Mk VII was the sinking of the on 17 July 1942, which was achieved in combination with a Lancaster heavy bomber.U-boat.net/ \\"U-206.\\" uboat.net. Retrieved: 8 August 2010.Uboat.net/ \\"U-751.\\" uboat.net. Retrieved: 8 August 2010. Having evaluated the Whitley in 1942, the Fleet Air Arm operated a number of modified ex-RAF Mk VIIs from 1944 to 1946, to train aircrew in Merlin engine management and fuel transfer procedures. Civilian service In April/May 1942, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operated 15 Whitley Mk V aircraft which had been converted into freighters. The conversion process involved the removal of all armaments, the turret recesses were faired over, additional fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bay, the interior of the fuselage was adapted for freight stowage, and at least one aircraft was fitted with an enlarged cargo door.Moyes 1967, p. 11. The type was typically used for night supply flights from Gibraltar to Malta; the route took seven hours, and would often require landing during Axis air attacks on the island of Malta. . Whitley freighters also flew the dangerous route between Leuchars Station, Scotland and Stockholm, Sweden. The Whitley consumed a disproportionally large quantity of fuel to carry a relatively small payload, and there were various other reasons making the type less than ideal, so, in August 1942, the type was replaced by the Lockheed Hudson and the 14 survivors were returned to the RAF.Jackson 1973, p. 325. Variants A Whitley prototype, circa 1936 No. 502 Squadron, 1940 Following the two prototypes (K4586 and K4587), at the outbreak of the war the RAF had 207 Whitleys in service ranging from Mk I to Mk IV types, with improved versions following: ;Mk I :A.W. Type 188. Powered by Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX air-cooled radial engines, 4 degrees of dihedral incorporated into each outer wing panel, with earlier aircraft being retrospectively modified: 34 built. ;Mk II :A.W. Type 197 (some Type 220). Powered by two-speed supercharged Tiger VIII engines: 46 built. ;Mk III :A.W. Type 205. Powered by Tiger VIII engines, retractable \\"dustbin\\" ventral turret fitted aft of the wing root armed with two .303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns, hydraulically operated bomb bay doors and ability to carry larger bombs: 80 built. ;Mk IV :A.W. Type 209. Powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin IV inline liquid-cooled engines, increased fuel capacity, extended bomb-aimer's transparency, manually operated tail and retractable ventral turrets replaced with a Nash & Thompson powered turret equipped with four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, produced from 1938: 33 built. ;Mk IVA :A.W. Type 210. Mk IV variant powered by Merlin X engines made by fitting Merlin X engines on last Mk IV's on production line: seven built. ;Mk V :A.W. Type 207. The main wartime production version based on the Mk IV, modified straight- edged fins, leading edge de-icing, tail fuselage aft or empennage extended by 15 in (381 mm) to improve the tail gunner's field of fire. First flew in December 1938, production ceased in June 1943: 1,466 built. ;Mk VI :Proposed Pratt & Whitney G.R.1830 Twin Wasp-powered version of Mk V in case of Merlin production shortfall: none built. ;Mk VII :A.W. Type 217. Designed for service with Coastal Command and carried a sixth crew member, capable of longer-range flights (2,300 mi/3,700 km compared to the early version's 1,250 mi/2,011 km) having additional fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bay and fuselage, equipped with Air to Surface Vessel (ASV) radar for anti-shipping patrols with an additional four 'stickleback' dorsal radar masts and other antennae: 146 built.Moyes 1967, pp. 7, 10. Being heavier and less efficient with its aerials, this Mk could not maintain altitude on only one engine.

It was originally recorded as a big band/swing tune by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra and featured in the 1941 movie Sun Valley Serenade. It was the first song to receive a gold record, presented by RCA Victor in 1942, for sales of 1.2 million copies. Background The song was an extended production number in the 20th Century Fox film Sun Valley Serenade. The Glenn Miller recording, RCA Bluebird B-11230-B, became the #1 song across the United States on December 7, 1941, and remained at #1 for nine weeks on the Billboard Best Sellers chart. The flip side of the single was \\"I Know Why (And So Do You)\\", which was the A side. The song opens up with the band, sounding like a train rolling out of the station, complete with the trumpets and trombones imitating a train whistle, before the instrumental portion comes in playing two parts of the main melody. This is followed by the vocal introduction of four lines before the main part of the song is heard. The main song opens with a dialog between a passenger and a shoeshine boy: :\\"Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?\\" :\\"Yes, yes, Track 29!\\" :\\"Boy, you can give me a shine.\\" :\\"Can you afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo?\\" :\\"I've got my fare, and just a trifle to spare.\\" The singer describes the train's route, originating from Pennsylvania Station in New York and running through Baltimore to North Carolina before reaching Chattanooga. He mentions a woman he knew from an earlier time in his life, who will be waiting for him at the station and with whom he plans to settle down for good. After the entire song is sung, the band plays two parts of the main melody as an instrumental, with the instruments imitating the \\"WHOO WHOO\\" of the train as the song ends. The 78-rpm was recorded on May 7, 1941, for RCA Victor's Bluebird label and became the first to be certified a gold disc on February 10, 1942, for 1,200,000 sales. The transcription of this award ceremony can be heard on the first of three volumes of RCA's \\"Legendary Performer\\" compilations released by RCA in the 1970s. In the early 1990s a two-channel recording of a portion of the Sun Valley Serenade soundtrack was discovered, allowing reconstruction of a true- stereo version of the film performance. The composition was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941 for Best Song from a movie. The song achieved its success that year even though it could not be heard on network radio for much of 1941 due to the ASCAP boycott. In 1996, the 1941 recording of \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Inspiration The song was written by the team of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren, allegedly while traveling on the Southern Railway's Birmingham Special train. Details in the song don't align with The Birmingham Special, however, which suggests they took a large amount of artistic license. To wit: * \\"Track twenty nine,\\" but Pennsylvania Station in New York had 21 tracks. * \\"You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four,\\" but The Birmingham Special departed at 12:30 p.m. * \\"Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina,\\" but The Birmingham Special didn't pass through the Carolinas. It passed through western Virginia and East Tennessee. Personnel On the May 7, 1941, original recording by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra in Hollywood on RCA Bluebird, the featured singer was Tex Beneke, who was accompanied by Paula Kelly, the Modernaires (vocals), Billy May, John Best, Ray Anthony, R.D. McMickle (trumpet), Glenn Miller, Jim Priddy, Paul Tanner, Frank D'Annolfo (trombone), Hal McIntyre, Wilbur Schwartz (clarinet, alto saxophone), Tex Beneke, Al Klink (tenor saxophone), Ernie Caceres (baritone saxophone), Chummy MacGregor (piano), Jack Lathrop (guitar), Trigger Alpert (bass), and Maurice Purtill (drums). The arrangement was by Jerry Gray. Cover versions The song has been recorded by numerous artists, including Beegie Adair, the Andrews Sisters, Ray Anthony, Asleep at the Wheel, BBC Big Band, George Benson, John Bunch, Caravelli, Regina Carter, Ray Charles, Harry Connick, Jr., Ray Conniff, John Denver, Ernie Fields, St√©phane Grappelli and Marc Fosset, John Hammond, Jr., the Harmonizing Four, Harmony Grass, Ted Heath, Betty Johnson, Susannah McCorkle, Ray McKinley, Big Miller, the Muppets, Richard Perlmutter, Oscar Peterson, Spike Robinson, Harry Roy, Jan Savitt, Hank Snow, Teddy Stauffer, Dave Taylor, Claude Thornhill, the Tornados, and Guy Van Duser. Other notable performances include: * Cab Calloway and His Orchestra recorded a cover version of \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" for Conqueror Records in 1941. * Carmen Miranda recorded a cover on July 25, 1942, and sang it in the movie Springtime in the Rockies. * Bill Haley & His Comets released a cover of \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" as a 45 single on Essex Records in 1954. * Pianist Floyd Cramer recorded a single version on RCA Records in 1962. * UK instrumental group the Shadows recorded a version of the song for their album Dance with the Shadows which reached number two in the UK album charts in 1964. * The American musical group Harpers Bizarre released a cover version of the song, which reached No. 45 on the U.S. pop chart and spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Easy Listening chart in 1968. * An instrumental version of the theme was released 1975 in Germany under the name \\"Maddox\\", produced by Dicky Tarrach. * In the 1974 film Young Frankenstein, when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein asks a local boy for directions to the Transylvania Station, their dialogue closely follows a lyric from the song. * In 1978, the studio group Tuxedo Junction recorded a disco version that hit the American Top 40; it peaked at No. 32 Pop and No. 18 on the Easy Listening chart. * Haruomi Hosono released a half-Portuguese, half- Japanese cover of the song (based on Carmen Miranda's interpretation) as the opening track on his 1975 album Tropical Dandy. * In the 1970s, the tune was used in the UK on an advertisement for Toffee Crisp candy bars, starting with \\"Pardon me, boy, is that a Toffee Crisp you chew chew,\\" and ending with the punch line \\"Chew chew Toffee crisp, and you'll go far.\\" * A cover by Steve Lucky & the Rhumba Bums was featured in the 2005 film Be Cool. * The song's intro was sampled by That Handsome Devil in their song \\"Damn Door\\" for their 2008 debut album A City Dressed in Dynamite. * Barry Manilow recorded a version on the Singin' With the Big Bands album, 1994. * A modern interpretation of the song was recorded by Herb Alpert for his In the Mood album of 2014. German and Dutch versions *The tune was adopted twice for German songs. Both songs deal with trains, and both songs start with (different) translations of \\"pardon me\\". The first was created and performed in 1947 by the German pop singer Bully Buhlan (Zug nach K√∂tzschenbroda). The lyrics are humorously describing the bother of a train ride out of post-war Berlin: no guarantee to arrive at a destination due to coal shortage, passengers traveling on coach buffers, steps and roofs, and never-ending trip interruptions including a night stop for delousing. *The second, Sonderzug nach Pankow, created by the German rock musician Udo Lindenberg in 1983 became very popular and had various political implications. Lindenberg was a West German singer and songwriter with a suitable fan community in East Germany. He had applied for years to tour the GDR but was rejected several times. The 1983 cover version of Chattanooga Choo Choo was directly asking the GDR's Chairman of the Council of State Erich Honecker for permission to hold a concert in the Palace of the Republic (Berlin). The song was released on February 2, 1983, and was repeatedly featured in the West as well in the East. The song itself and the Glenn Miller original were temporarily interdicted in the GDR. Nevertheless, Lindenberg finally succeeded in getting an invitation to the GDR rock festival Rock for Peace on October 25, 1983, on the condition that Lindenberg would not play Sonderzug nach Pankow at the concert. Honecker, a former brass band drummer of Rotfrontk√§mpferbund, and Lindenberg exchanged presents in form of a leather jacket and a metal shawm in 1987. Lindenberg's success at passing the Inner German border peacefully with a humorous song gave him celebrity status as well as a positive political acknowledgement in both West and East Germany. *Lindenberg's version was adapted by Dutch singer Willem Duyn as Ik Neem De Eerste Trein Naar Zandvoort (free translation; \\"I'll Take The Morning train to Zandvoort\\") who made it a summer-hit in 1983. In the lyrics Duyn chronicles chaos and mayhem on the morning seaside-train. Wartime release 1944 release as a V-Disc by the U.S. War Department In October 1944, a new recording by Captain Glenn Miller and the Army Air Forces Training Command Orchestra featuring Sgt. Ray McKinley and the Crew Chiefs on vocals was released as a V-Disc by the U.S. War Department, one of a series of recordings sent free by the U.S. War Department to overseas military personnel during World War II. Legacy and popular culture Terminal Station, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Today, trains have a pride of place in Chattanooga's former Terminal Station. Once owned and operated by the Southern Railway, the station was saved from demolition after the withdrawal of passenger rail service in the early 1970s, and it is now part of a 30-acre (12-hectare) resort complex, including the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel, and numerous historical railway exhibits. Hotel guests can stay in half of a restored passenger railway car. Dining at the complex includes the Gardens restaurant in the Terminal Station itself, The Station House (which is housed in a former baggage storage room and known for its singing waitstaff) and the \\"Dinner in the Diner\\" which is housed in a restored 1941 Class A dining car. The music venue \\"Track29\\" is also on the grounds of the Chattanooga Choo Choo hotel in the building that formerly housed the city's only ice rink at the back of the property. The city's other historic station, Union Station, parts of which predated the Civil War, was demolished in 1973; the site is now an office building formerly housing the corporate offices of the Krystal restaurant chain (the restaurant chain offices have since relocated to Atlanta, Georgia). In addition to the railroad exhibits at \\"the Choo Choo\\", there are further exhibits at Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, in east Chattanooga. The reputation given to the city by the song also has lent itself to making Chattanooga the home of the National Model Railroad Association since 1982. In addition, the athletic mascot of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga was, for a time, a rather menacing-looking anthropomorphized mockingbird named Scrappy, who was dressed as a railroad engineer and was sometimes depicted at the throttle of a steam locomotive. Choo Choo VORTAC, a radio aid to navigation, is sited near Chattanooga at . \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" has been performed in numerous TV shows, including several episodes of M*A*S*H, 1967 episodes of The Red Skelton Show and The Lawrence Welk Show, and a 2006 episode of Midsomer Murders. In addition to TV shows, \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\"' has been sung in numerous movies, including the 1950 movie The Big Lift, the 1957 movie Peyton Place, the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora!, the 1984 eponymous film Chattanooga Choo Choo, the 1988 films Big and Biloxi Blues, the 1998 film Babe: Pig in the City, and the 2005 film Be Cool.

This established and normalized diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China (PRC) resulted in the severing of official relations between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. The document produced nine articles in a joint statement which found a compromise in previously ambiguous principles enunciated by both sides. Four points are worthy of attention: 1) peace treaty between Japan and China, 2) the status of Taiwan, 3) the question of hegemony in East Asia, and 4) Japan's reversed relations with China and Taiwan. In the end, the document ended the \\"abnormal relations between Japan and China\\", recognized the People's Republic of China as the \\"sole government of China\\", and renounced any claim for war reparations from World War II. In addition, it concluded various administrative agreements between the two countries in trade, fisheries, aviation, and navigation amongst others. The document firmly maintains its stance under Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration.  Before the Communique   Japan's Relations with ROC  Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945. After the Korean War, the Japanese government during the Yoshida Cabinet lost its hope of establishing substantial relations with Peking, and instead began taking into consideration the prospect of signing a peace treaty and establishing diplomatic normalization with Taipei. Japan at the time also carried the debt of gratitude to Nationalist China, as Chiang Kai-shek made the announcement of \\"returning virtue for malice\\" (uramini mukuiruni tokuwo motte suru) and repatriated all the Japanese troops. As a result, on 25 April 1952, according to the Yoshida Letter, \\"the Japanese government has no intention to conclude a bilateral treaty with the Communist regime in China\\", and later on the Japan- ROC Peace Treaty was signed. During this time in the early 1950s, Japan was put under pressure by the US to not recognize the newly established PRC which was at war with the US in Korea, and instead recognized the government of ROC led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China. Tokyo then signed a peace treaty with Taipei as a proof to this close tie.  Japan's Relations with PRC  Before normalization from 1952 to 1972, Japan only had diplomatic relations with Taiwan and not China. Although Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was in support of Taiwan, he regarded China as a threat in keeping with the United States' China policy. However, since the US-Japan Security Treaty was the foundation of Japan's foreign policy, it had become subordinate to the United States‚Äô anti-communist strategy in East Asia. Richard Nixon (right), 37th US President Despite this, Japan was interested in restoring relations with China due to cultural, security and economic interests. Japan and China have been neighboring countries for almost two thousand years and shared many cultural, historical and religious heritages. In terms of security interests, Japan wanted to restore its relations with China in order to set the tone for a peaceful diplomatic relationship after years of war. Japan was reliant on China for raw materials and economic market itself, therefore it was more beneficial for the Japanese economy to do business with the Chinese economy. However this changed after a surprise visit by President Nixon to China in 1971, also known as the \\"Nixon Shock\\". Coinciding with the financial crisis which Japan faced, Chinese businesses were more attractive for the Japanese economy. Eventually Prime Minister Sato resigned, which lead to the next cabinet of Prime Minister Tanaka. Contrastingly, Prime Minister Tanaka made the restoration of relations between Japan and China an issue of priority in his agenda, hence his pursuing of the Joint Communique. This was beneficial for China as well since it could lead to a smooth entry back into the international society and could end the state of war between China and Japan.  UN's Recognition of PRC  1971 witnessed an erosion of Taiwan's international position and a shift in Japan-ROC-PRC relations. Firstly, as mentioned above, the Nixon administration removed travel and trading barriers, as well as proposed a more serious dialogue with Peking due to the Cold War politics and in relations to the US-Soviet situation. Secondly, regarding the real issue that threatened Taipei's international position is the UN General Assembly vote in 1971. From 1945 until 1971, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist regime occupied the so-called \\"China seat\\" as an original member and one of the five permanent members of the Security Council under the auspices of the US and a ‚Äòmoratorium‚Äô against Communist China (PRC). However, due to decolonization and the admission of numerous Third World states to the General Assembly, Washington lost its grip on the UN and could no longer sustain the moratorium, thus the Chinese representation issue was considered as an ‚Äòimportant question‚Äô which required a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly for a resolution to pass. On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly led by Albania voted to admit the PRC and to expel the ROC. The 17 UN members during the General Assembly declared that the existence of PRC was \\"a reality that could not be changed to suit the myth of a so-called Republic of China, fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory\\", and that the ROC was \\"unlawful authorities\\" that remained there only because of the permanent presence of the US Armed Forces. PRC, therefore, assumed the ROC's place in the General Assembly as well as its place as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. After the UN General Assembly vote on Peking and Taipei, it was hinted that Japan no longer recognized the Chiang Kai-shek government as the sole legitimate government of China, but only as the government of Taiwan, and that Japan was ready to shift recognition to Peking. In short, Taipei's failure in remaining in the UN's Security Council and the General Assembly along with the Sino-US rapprochement have pushed the Japanese government towards achieving normalization with Peking through establishing the Joint Communique and ultimately severed diplomatic relations with the ROC.  Terms of Communique   Initial Proposals  Masayoshi ≈åhira, former Foreign Minister and Prime Minister of Japan  Japan  From September 26th to the 27th in 1972, Japan's Foreign Minister Masayoshi ≈åhira and PRC's Foreign Minister Ji Pengfei met to negotiate a proposal for the declaration. Ji Pengfei (right), former Foreign Minister of China Japan explained that in Clause 1, they should raise the issue of the state of war between China and Japan. Japan negotiated to China that they could not accept China's interpretation of officially ending the state of war in this joint declaration. This was because although China was not bounded by the peace treaty between Japan and Taiwan (Treaty of Taipei ), by which Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) government of Chiang Kai-shek had already established the end of World War II. Japan negotiated to emphasize the existence of a peaceful relationship between the two countries and leave the specific timing of the end of the state of war unspecified. Although Japan's standpoint on the Treaty of Taipei did not change, if diplomatic normalization between Japan and China is established, Japan was willing to terminate the Treaty of Taipei.  PRC  In 1971, a Japanese delegation of politicians from the Komeito party visited Beijing and announced in a joint statement with the China-Japan Friendship Association that there were five principles which were preconditions of relations between Japan and China, which are: # There is only one China, and the government of the People's Republic is the sole legitimate government representing the Chinese people; # Taiwan is a province of China and an inalienable part of Chinese territory; # the \\"Japan-Chiang [Peace] Treaty \\" is illegal and must be abrogated; # the United States must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area; and # the legitimate rights of the People's Republic in all United Nations organizations must be restored and the representatives of Taiwan expelled. These principles were approved by Premier Chou En-lai and they did not represent anything new to what China had long been asking of Japan. In fact, these proposals date back to 1953. Dissenting members in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), opposition parties, and the left-wing Japan Communist Party (JCP) left-wing accepted the first 3 points without reservation. However, the LDP was hesitant to approve China's proposal, especially since the first two points suggest Japan would have to abolish their peace treaty with Taiwan. Furthermore, in addition, point 4 was beyond Japan's capacity, as they hold no sovereign power over US maritime activity in the region. Lastly, point 5 lost its relevance after China joined the UN in 1971.  Negotiations between Japan and PRC   Outline Proposal  The outline proposal in which the Foreign Minister of Japan Masayoshi ≈åhira and Foreign Minister of China Ji Pengfei agreed upon for the Japan-China Joint Declaration can be seen as follows: # The state of war between Japan and the People's Republic of China ends on the date of the declaration. # The Government of Japan fully recognizes the Three Principles for the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and China that was presented by the Government of the People's Republic of China, and also fully recognizes that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole and lawful government of China. # Both parties declare that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan conforms to the long-term wishes of their respective citizens and that it is in line with the benefit of the peoples of the world. # Both parties agree to treat relations between China and Japan on the basis of the Five Principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual nonaggression; mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. In accordance with the Five Principles, disputes between China and Japan will be resolved through peaceful dialogue and without the use of force or the threat of force. # Both parties declare that neither China nor Japan will seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and will oppose any country or group of countries that seek hegemony in this manner. # Both parties agree to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship that is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence after the establishment of diplomatic relations. # For the sake of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, the Government of the People's Republic of China abandons its right to demand war reparations from Japan. # The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan, prior to the conclusion of a peace and friendship treaty, will conclude agreements on commerce, shipping, air traffic, weather, post, fisheries, and science and technology on the basis of need and preexistence in order to promote the human exchange the economic and cultural relations.  Draft of Joint Declaration  The governments of Japan and China agreed upon a draft Joint declaration as follows: * China and Japan are only separated by a sea, and a perpetual and traditionally friendly relationship existed in the history between the two countries. The peoples of both countries long to correct the extremely anomalous state that existed between the two countries. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan will open a new page for the history of relations between the two countries. * (The Government of Japan is deeply repentant over the damages that Japanese militarism has caused on the people of China in the past. At the same time, the Government of Japan fully recognizes the Three Principles for the Restoration of Relations submitted by the Government of the People's Republic of China. From this standpoint diplomatic normalization between China and Japan will be conducted.) * The Government of the People's Republic of China welcomes this. Although the social policies of China and Japan differ, the two countries should and can have peaceful and friendly relations. The renewed establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and the development of friendly neighbor relations is not only in line with the fundamental interest of the citizens of both countries, but is also useful for the relaxation of tensions in Asia and for the protection of world peace. * The Governments of both countries have reached the following agreements through friendly discussion: # On the date of the announcement of the joint declaration, the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Japan will end. # (The Government of Japan recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the solely lawful government of representing China) The Government of the People's Republic of China once more declares that Taiwan is an indivisible part of the territory of China. (The Government of Japan endorses, based on the Cairo Declaration, the Government of China's standpoint.) # The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government Japan have decided to establish diplomatic relations from September (date) 1972. In line with international law and international custom, both Governments of the respective countries will establish in each other's capitals the embassies and other establishments necessary to carry out their functions. In addition, they agree to exchange ambassadors as quickly as possible. # For the sake of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, the Government of the People's Republic of China renounces its claims for war reparations # The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China agree to establish a permanent, friendly relationships following the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, nonintervention in domestic issues, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. # The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan declare that both countries shall not seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and that both countries will oppose any country or group of countries that seek to establish hegemony in this manner. # The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government Japan have agreed to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship in order to develop the peaceful and friendly relations between the peoples of both countries. # The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan will conclude individual agreements on commerce, shipping, air traffic, fisheries, weather, post, and science and technology on the basis of need and in accordance to preexisting agreements in order to develop the economic and cultural relations between the two countries and to expand the exchange of people. The sections in parentheses are as appears in the original document.  Final Agreement  Kakuei Tanaka, former Prime Minister of Japan From September 25 to September 30, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited the PRC at the invitation of Premier of the State Council Chou En-lai. Accompanying PM Tanaka were Minister for Foreign Affairs Masayoshi ≈åhira, Chief Cabinet Secretary Susumu Nikaido, and other government officials. Chairman Mao Zedong Chairman Mao Tse-tung met Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka on September 27. PM Tanaka and FM ≈åhira had an earnest and frank exchange of views with Premier Chou En-lai and Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs Chi Peng-fei on the question of normalization of relations between Japan and China and other problems between the two countries as well as on other matters of interest to both sides, and agreed to issue the following Joint Communique: * Japan and China are neighboring countries, separated only by a strip of water with a long history of traditional friendship. The people of the two countries earnestly desire to put an end to the abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between the two countries. The realization of the aspiration of the two peoples for the termination of the state of war and the normalization of relations between Japan and China will add a new page to the annals of relations between the two countries. * The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself. Further, the Japanese side reaffirms its position that it intends to realize the normalization of relations between the two countries from the stand of fully understanding 'the three principles for the restoration of relations\\" put forward by the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese side expresses its welcome for this. * In spite of the differences in their social systems existing between the two countries, the two countries should, and can, establish relations of peace and friendship. The normalization of relations and development of good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries are in the interests of the two peoples and will contribute to the relaxation of tension in Asia and peace in the world. # The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People's Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued. # The Government of Japan recognizes that Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. # The Government of the People's Republic of China reiterates that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Government of Japan fully understands and respects this stand of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and it firmly maintains its stand under Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation. # The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China have decided to establish diplomatic relations as from September 29, 1972. The two Governments have decided to take all necessary measures for the establishment and the performance of the functions of each other's embassy in their respective capitals in accordance with international law and practice, and to exchange ambassadors as speedily as possible. # The Government of the People's Republic of China declares that in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan. # The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China agree to establish relations of perpetual peace and friendship between the two countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. The two Governments confirm that, in conformity with the foregoing principles and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Japan and China shall in their mutual relations settle all disputes by peaceful means and shall refrain from the use or threat of force. # The normalization of relations between Japan and China is not directed against any third country. Neither of the two countries should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony. # The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to solidifying and developing the relations of peace and friendship between the two countries, the two Governments will enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace and friendship. # The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to further promoting relations between the two countries and to expanding interchanges of people, the two Governments will, as necessary and taking account of the existing non-governmental arrangements, enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding agreements concerning such matters as trade, shipping, aviation, and fisheries.  Reactions of Public   Japan  A survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet in 1978 showed that 62.1% of Japanese people who participated in the survey had \\"friendly feelings toward China\\" and 25.6% did \\"not have friendly feelings toward China\\". These survey results showed that a large proportion of the population had improved feelings toward China after the Joint Communique was agreed upon. This was mainly because of China's withdrawal of any war compensation claims made to the Japanese people in addition to their approval of the United States-Japan Security Treaty. In 1980, the same survey was conducted on the Japanese people, which showed, 78.6% had \\"friendly feelings toward China\\" and just 14.7% did \\"not have friendly feelings toward China\\".  PRC  In the 1990s, criticism and dissatisfaction over the terms of the Joint Communique started to become a topic of discussion between the Chinese people. This was mainly towards the terms agreed upon regarding war reparations and compensation by the Japanese to the Chinese. Chinese people felt that the government had made a decision without consulting with the population first. In response to this, the Chinese government clarified the terms of the Joint Communique. They emphasized that although the Chinese government cannot demand compensation, Chinese citizens as individuals still have the right to demand compensation.  ROC  Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-Kuo in 1948 Before the announcement of the communique, there were signs to show public anxiety toward an expanded US-Sino relations. PM Tanaka's trip to Peking (September 25‚Äì30) was greeted with anger. Taipei delayed the mission of Tanaka's special envoy, Etsusaburo Shiina, so that it coincided with the 41st anniversary of the September 18 Mukden Incident, an infamous episode in the difficult course of Sino-Japanese relations. When Shiina met with new ROC Premier Chiang Ching-kuo and Vice President Yen Chia-kan, he was greeted with rare mass demonstrations. His picture showed up on neither TV nor in the press as opposed to the wide coverage of another visitor, the Mayor of Seoul. In response to the situation, Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, in his inaugural speech on June 13, 1972, reassured citizens at a time of national diversity by confirming the stance of Nationalist China (ROC) that there were only \\"one conflict\\" (the struggle between the humanitarian rule of the Three Principles of the People and the tyrannical rule of Chinese communists), \\"one war\\" (the recovery of the mainland), \\"one responsibility\\" (the elimination of the communists), and \\"one outcome\\" (the victory of Nationalist China).  Aftermath of the Communique   Japan-PRC Relations  The normalization of diplomatic relationships between China and Japan was said to have contributed greatly to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and peace. Since normalization, both economic and cultural exchanged started to improve. The interactions between the people of China and Japan also improved. From 1979 onwards, Japan started offering Official Development Assistance (ODA) to China. This was done through numerous projects such as energy development, infrastructure development, and environmental protection which was done through low-interest Yen loans, grants and transfer of technological materials. These ODA helped to develop the Chinese economy into a larger and more open one. Normalization also allowed for Japanese companies to pursue business in the large Chinese market which benefited the Japanese economy as well. These efforts lead to increased dependency on both sides. In terms of cultural exchanges, Japanese Sumo wrestlers toured China in April 1973, and in the same month China dispatched 55 members for a goodwill mission in Japan. The Chinese cultural delegation also visited Japan in June 1973 to view Chinese art treasures which belonged to the Japanese Imperial Household. In terms of economic and trade relations, within the first year of normalized relations, 28 Japanese Economic and Trade missions visited China. This included the Yasuhiro Nakasone mission in January 1973 and delegations representing the Promotion of International Trade (Kokubosoku). Overall, there were many economic delegations and representatives of banks and firms of both countries visited each other. According to the Ministry of Finance, there was a 83% increase of trade between China and Japan in 1973 compared to the year before. This can be explained with several reasons. The Tanaka government of Japan made credits available for the Export-Import Bank of China. At the same time Peking was increasing its efforts to accelerate its five-year economic plan which lasted from 1971 to 1975. It was also suggested that China felt apprehensive about Japan's potential involvement in the Soviet proposed multi-dimensional development plan in Siberia. Disputed Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands Although Japan and China's economic relationship has remained largely stable, other issues such as historical problems and the Senkaku-Diaoyu islands dispute have caused friction within their relationship.  Japan-ROC Relations  Had Chiang Kai-shek managed to keep the China seat by abandoning his ‚Äòone China ‚Äô discourse more clearly and timely in 1971, PM Tanaka would not have been so keen on normalizing relations with Beijing in 1972 and Taipei would have avoided severing relations with Tokyo. After Tokyo and Peking normalized relations in 1972, there was a formal disengagement of the Japanese authorities from Taiwan. On December 26, 1972, two private associations were created to supervise bilateral exchanges between Tokyo and Taipei - the Interchange Association on Tokyo's side and the East Asian Relations Association on Taipei's side. ‚ÄòJapan‚Äô and ‚ÄòTaiwan‚Äô are avoided to be named or referenced in the names of both associations. The two associations carried out functions that were normally handled by consular institutions. For example, Taipei's high-ranking civil servants accompanying commercial missions to Japan were introduced as simple experts with ordinary passports. In short, Tokyo- Taipei's relations were reduced/ relegated to the private sector. In terms of economic impacts of the communique, despite the deteriorated diplomatic relations with Japan, Taiwan's trade with many countries continued to flourish. However, Taiwan experienced a $1.336 billion trade deficit with Japan in 1974. In the following year, the trade deficit with Japan was $1.101 billion, a drop of $235 million compared to 1974 but nearly double Taiwan's overall 1975 deficit of $611 million. Moreover, there was a strong sense of antagonism arose so intensely that caused harm to Japanese businesses in Taiwan (i.e. Japan Airlines soon had to take special precautions against sabotage on every flight to and from Taiwan). Regarding the impacts of Japan- ROC within the period of 1980s-1990s, Japanese supporters of Taiwan continued to advocate for the country's independence movement. Pro-Taiwan voices were down in the 1970s but were never totally out. They acted as check-and-balance mechanisms to prevent the government from going too far in improving Japan- China relations at the expense of sacrificing Taiwan's interests. After the Tiananmen Massacre in June 1989 temporarily ruptured Sino-Japanese relations, Beijing's intolerance of democratic ideas made democratized Taiwan more favorable in Japanese eyes. Japan-based pro-independence activists promoted Japanese popular awareness of Taiwan as an independent country. Additionally, during this period, the booming of tourism and the mainstream media's return to Taiwan.  US-China-Japan Relations After the Communique  From 1972 to 1978, some have argued that the cold war was the golden period of US-China- Japan cooperation, however always within the context of the US-China security relationship. Sino-US relations constrained their respective policies toward third parties, especially Japan. Reaffirming the Sino-Japanese security cooperation could place Japan ahead of the US, and there were suggestions that Washington might not be pleased with this. Even after the establishment of the communique that represented the normalized Sino-Japanese relations, Japan's China policy was still affected by that of the US, as Japan depended on the US for security. Additionally, Sino-Japanese trade continued to boom, and Peking continued to pressure Japan to sign a peace treaty containing the anti- hegemony language of the 1972 normalization agreement. Overall, during the Carter administration, the triangular US-China-Japan relations continued to prevail. However, under the influence of the US, Peking \\"lacked the leverage to persuade Japan to adopt a China policy fundamentally different from that of the US\\".

A highly volatile, reactive, flammable, and colorless liquid, dimethylmercury is one of the strongest known neurotoxins, with a quantity of less than 0.1 mL capable of inducing severe mercury poisoning, and is easily absorbed through the skin. Dimethylmercury is capable of permeating many materials, including plastic and rubber compounds. It has a slightly sweet odor, although inhaling enough of the chemical to notice this would be hazardous. The acute toxicity of the compound was demonstrated by the 1997 death of heavy metal chemist Karen Wetterhahn, who died 10 months after a single exposure of only a few drops permeated through her disposable latex gloves. Synthesis, structure, and reactions The compound was one of the earliest organometallics reported, reflecting its considerable stability. It is formed by treating sodium amalgam with methyl halides: : Hg + 2 Na + 2 CH3I ‚Üí Hg(CH3)2 \\\\+ 2 NaI It can also be obtained by alkylation of mercuric chloride with methyllithium: : HgCl2 \\\\+ 2 LiCH3 ‚Üí Hg(CH3)2 \\\\+ 2 LiCl The molecule adopts a linear structure with Hg-C bond lengths of 2.083 √Ö. Reactions A novel feature of this compound is its unreactivity towards water and the fact that it reacts with mineral acids at a significant rate only at elevated temperatures, whereas the corresponding organocadmium and organozinc compounds hydrolyze rapidly. The difference reflects the low affinity of Hg(II) for oxygen ligands. The compound reacts with mercuric chloride to give the mixed chloro-methyl compound: : (CH3)2Hg + HgCl2 ‚Üí 2 CH3HgCl Whereas dimethylmercury is a volatile liquid, methylmercury chloride is a crystalline solid. Use Dimethylmercury currently has few applications because of the risks involved. As with many methyl- organometallics, it is a methylating agent that can donate its methyl groups to an organic molecule; however, the development of less acutely toxic nucleophiles such as dimethylzinc and trimethylaluminium, and the subsequent introduction of Grignard reagents (organometallic halides), has essentially rendered this compound obsolete in organic chemistry. It was formerly studied for reactions in which the methylmercury cation was bonded to the target molecule, forming potent bactericides; however, the bioaccumulation and ultimate toxicity of methylmercury has largely led it to be abandoned for this purpose in favor of the less toxic diethylmercury and ethylmercury compounds, which perform a similar function without the bioaccumulation hazard. In toxicology, it was formerly used as a reference toxin. It has also been used to calibrate NMR instruments for detection of mercury, although diethylmercury and less toxic mercury salts are now preferred. Safety Dimethylmercury is extremely toxic and dangerous to handle. Absorption of doses as low as 0.1 mL can result in severe mercury poisoning. The risks are enhanced because of the high vapor pressure of the liquid. Permeation tests showed that several types of disposable latex or polyvinyl chloride gloves (typically, about 0.1 mm thick), commonly used in most laboratories and clinical settings, had high and maximal rates of permeation by dimethylmercury within 15 seconds. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration advises handling dimethylmercury with highly resistant laminated gloves with an additional pair of abrasion- resistant gloves worn over the laminate pair, and also recommends using a face shield and working in a fume hood. Dimethylmercury is metabolized after several days to methylmercury. Methylmercury crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier easily, probably owing to formation of a complex with cysteine. It is eliminated from the organism slowly, and therefore has a tendency to bioaccumulate. The symptoms of poisoning may be delayed by months, resulting in cases in which a diagnosis is ultimately discovered, but only at the point in which it is too late for an effective treatment regimen to be successful. The toxicity of dimethylmercury was highlighted with the death of Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, in 1997. Professor Wetterhahn specialized in heavy metal poisoning. After she spilled a few drops of this compound on her latex glove, the barrier was compromised, and within minutes it was absorbed into her skin. It circulated through her body and accumulated in her brain, resulting in her death ten months later. This accident is a common toxicology case-study and directly resulted in improved safety procedures for chemical-protection clothing and fume hood use, which are now called for when any exposure to such severely toxic and/or highly penetrative substances is possible (e.g., in chemical munitions stockpiles and decontamination facilities).

History Log Cabin Republicans was founded in 1977 in California as a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the Briggs Initiative, which attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in public schools. In addition to sanctioning the termination of openly gay and lesbian teachers, the proposed legislation authorized the firing of those teachers that supported homosexuality. While mounting his imminent presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan publicly expressed his opposition to the discriminatory policy. Reagan's condemnation of the bill‚Äîepitomized in a letter sent to a pro-Briggs group, excerpts of which were re-printed in the San Francisco Chronicle in 1978‚Äîplayed an influential role in the eventual defeat of the Briggs Initiative. In the midst of this victory, gay conservatives in California created the Log Cabin Republicans. The group initially proposed to name themselves Lincoln Club, but found that name was already in use by the Lincoln Club of Orange County, another California Republican organization, so the name Log Cabin Republicans was chosen as an alternative title. This designation calls attention to the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln. The Log Cabin Republicans suggest that Lincoln founded the Republican Party on the philosophies of liberty and equality. These principles, Log Cabin argues, are consistent with their platform of an inclusive Republican Party. 1992 presidential election The 1992 Log Cabin Republican convention was held in Spring, Texas, a Houston exurb. The main point of discussion was whether or not LCR would endorse the re-election of President George H. W. Bush. The group voted to deny that endorsement because Bush did not denounce anti-gay rhetoric at the 1992 Republican National Convention. 1996 presidential election In August 1995, the campaign of Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, returned the LCR's $1,000 campaign contribution.Barron, C. 2004. A Big Question For Republicans, Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide Vol. 11. P.27-29 The campaign returned the contribution after openly lesbian columnist, Deb Price, of the Detroit News, asked about it after she saw it on a public report from the Federal Elections Commission. The campaign sent a written statement to Price saying that Dole was in \\"100% disagreement with the agenda of the Log Cabin Republicans.\\"Tafel, p. 167‚Äì168. The finance office of the campaign had solicited the contribution from LCR. At the event where it was given, Dole had personally spoken with LCR's then-executive director, Rich Tafel, about the group and about AIDS legislation it was promoting in the Senate. Weeks earlier, Dole agreed to co- sponsor the legislation after a meeting with Tafel at the campaign's headquarters.Tafel, p.164‚Äì166 It resulted in a front-page story in The New York Times, penned by Richard L. Berke, then-chief political reporter for the daily.Woodward, p. 251. As reporters, including Berke, were seeking confirmation of the story before it broke, Dole's finance chairman, John Moran, asked Tafel not to speak to the press and that Tafel's \\"steadfastness and statesmanship at this moment will be handsomely appreciated in the long run by the campaign.\\" Tafel refused.Tafel, p. 168. Pundits accused Dole of being a \\"flip-flopper and a hypocrite.\\"Rich, Frank \\"The Log Cabin Lesson\\". New York Times, October 21, 1995. Retrieved January 29, 2007. Editorials ran in major newspapers, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Times of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus.Tafel, p. 169‚Äì170.Woodward, p. 251. Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him.Tafel, p. 171. \\"I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it,\\" Dole said.Woodward, p. 284. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a \\"mistake\\" because the decision to return the check \\"gets into Bob Dole the person. It's not so much about Bob Dole the candidate. It's the person. Is he tolerant? Does he tolerate different views? Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?\\" He added, \\"This is basic, this is what people ought to know about you. Are you going to just do this because it sounds good politically?\\"Woodward, p. 286. LCR's leadership met with Dole's coalitions manager to discuss an endorsement after Dole's reversal.Tafel, p. 172. Among various items, Tafel demanded there be no gay bashing in the speeches from the podium of the 1996 Republican National Convention, nor any anti-homosexual signs on the convention floor. He also wanted to see a gay person address the convention and a public request from Dole's campaign for the LCR nod.Tafel, p. 173 On the closing night of the Convention, Stephen Fong, then-president of the San Francisco chapter, spoke at the dais as part of a series of speeches from \\"mainstreet Americans,\\" but was not publicly identified as gay.Tafel, p. 174. Nevertheless, his presence on the podium for the organization and for the gay and lesbian community \\"was something that would have been unimaginable four years earlier,\\" Tafel later wrote. Fong was the first openly gay speaker at a Republican National Convention. Two days later, Dole spokesperson Christina Martin told a reporter that the campaign \\"welcomed the endorsement of the Log Cabin Republicans.\\" LCR voted to endorse Dole for President, and then-Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour approved the use of the RNC's press briefing room for Tafel, LCR's convention delegates and officers of its national board to announce their decision. Later in the campaign, Tafel met with Dole's chief aide Sheila Burke, and the remaining demands LCR made for their endorsement were met. In a statement released by LCR, and confirmed to reporters by the campaign, Dole had pledged to maintain an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal workforce and full funding for AIDS programs. 2000 presidential election The group endorsed George W. Bush in 2000. 2004 presidential election Due to his support of the Federal Marriage Amendment, the group declined to endorse the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004. The proposed amendment would have constitutionally defined marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman. Bush's defense of the FMA led the group to vote 22 to 2 against an endorsement of his reelection. The Palm Beach County chapter in Florida did endorse him, resulting in the revocation of their charter. 2008 presidential election In September 2008, LCR voted to endorse the John McCain‚ÄìSarah Palin ticket in the 2008 presidential election. LCR President Patrick Sammon said the most important reason for their support was McCain's opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. 2012 presidential election On 23 October 2012, LCR officially endorsed Mitt Romney despite Mr. Romney's commitment to a constitutional amendment barring gays and lesbians from marriage nationwide and his objection to the repeal of the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy on military service. In a public statement, LCR said it supported Romney due to the \\"gravity of the economic and national security issues currently at stake\\". Moreover, LCR expressed its hope that Romney would reconsider his opposition to the Employment Non- Discrimination Act, but he did not. 2016 presidential election On October 22, 2016, the board members of LCR voted not to endorse the Republican nominee for President, Donald Trump. In defiance, the LCR statewide chapters of Colorado, Georgia, and Texas, along with the LCR countywide chapter of Orange County, California and the LCR city chapters of Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; and Cleveland, Ohio; voted to endorse Donald Trump. In Florida, at least one report claimed Trump was able to cut into the vote margin in heavily Democratic Broward County, Florida with the help of the local chapter of Log Cabin Republicans. Nationwide, exit polls estimated that Trump received the lowest percentage of the LGBT vote by any Republican Presidential candidate since the metric was first included in Presidential polls in 1992. Trump received only 14% of the LGBT vote, a significant decline from Mitt Romney who received 22% in 2012. On November 9, 2016, the national LCR congratulated Donald Trump on his victory. 2020 presidential endorsement In November 2018, Jerri Ann Henry became the first woman to serve as Log Cabin executive director. A month later, she said in a television interview that, while she perceived Trump as having been \\"vocally supportive\\" of LGBT people compared to other Republican presidents and presidential candidates, nevertheless there had been \\"a lot of ups and downs in the last two years with some of the administration's actions.\\" Despite the reservations of their executive director, the Log Cabins endorsed Trump over a year in advance of the election. On August 16, 2019, chair Robert Kabel and vice chair Jill Homan gave their reasons for the endorsement in a Washington Post op-ed. Jennifer Horn (who earlier in the year had served as campaign manager for Bill Weld, who challenged Trump in the 2020 primary) resigned in protest from the Log Cabin board, as did Sarah Longwell, the first female member of Log Cabin's board. Jerri Ann Henry left her position as executive director 10 days after the op-ed was published. Log Cabin Republicans v. United States A lawsuit filed by LCR in federal court challenging the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" (DADT) policy, which excludes homosexuals from openly serving in the U. S. military, went to trial on July 13, 2010, presided by Judge Virginia Phillips. LCR argued that the policy violates the rights of homosexual military members to free speech, due process and open association. The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest.Law.com: Constitutional Challenge to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Reaches Trial LCR introduced several admissions by President Barack Obama, including that DADT \\"doesn't contribute to our national security,\\" \\"weakens our national security,\\" and that reversing DADT is \\"essential for our national security\\". Rather than address plaintiff's claims or bring evidence to support their own claims of national interest, the government relied exclusively on the policy's 1993 legislative history. On September 9, 2010, Phillips ruled in favor of plaintiffs, finding that DADT violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. On September 29, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's decision, ruling that the legislative repeal of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" by President Barack Obama and the outgoing Democratic congressional majority in December 2010 rendered the case moot. The dismissal left the lower court ruling without value as precedent. Platform LCR acts under the statement: \\"We are loyal Republicans. We believe in limited government, strong national defense, free markets, low taxes, personal responsibility, and individual liberty. Log Cabin Republicans represents an important part of the American family‚Äîtaxpaying, hard working people who proudly believe in this nation's greatness. We also believe all Americans have the right to liberty and equality. We believe equality for LGBT Americans is in the finest tradition of the Republican Party. We educate our Party about why inclusion wins. Opposing gay and lesbian equality is inconsistent with the GOP's core principles of smaller government and personal freedom.\\" On social issues, LCR either dissents from socially conservative Republican views or is neutral. On matters relating to gay and lesbian rights, LCR advocates for same-sex marriage and tax equity for domestic partner benefits. The LCR website also contains an 'Equality Map' giving information on state laws in areas from employment discrimination and relationship recognition to hate crimes protections and anti-bullying laws. LCR takes no official position on abortion. On the issue of national defense: \\"Log Cabin Republicans believe in a confident foreign policy and a strong national defense. As the world's sole military superpower, it is vital that the United States remain ready and able to shoulder its responsibilities in the global arena while standing as a beacon of freedom. Log Cabin Republicans call attention to the cruel and abusive treatment of gays and lesbians worldwide, particularly as it coincides with authoritarian regimes renowned for supporting terrorism and disregarding other basic human rights.\\" Membership Chapters Since 1977, LCR has expanded across the United States and has 35 chapters, representing 26 states and the District of Columbia: * Arizona Log Cabin Republicans * Arkansas Log Cabin Republicans * California Log Cabin Republicans  Los Angeles Log Cabin Republicans  Marin County Log Cabin Republicans  Orange County Log Cabin Republicans  Palm Springs Log Cabin Republicans  Sacramento Log Cabin Republicans  San Diego Log Cabin Republicans  San Francisco Log Cabin Republicans  Sequoias Log Cabin Republicans  Silicon Valley Log Cabin Republicans  UCB / Alameda County Log Cabin Republicans  Ventura County Log Cabin Republicans * Colorado Log Cabin Republicans * Delaware Log Cabin Republicans * District of Columbia Log Cabin Republicans * Florida Log Cabin Republicans  Broward Log Cabin Republicans  Miami Log Cabin Republicans  Northeast / Jacksonville Log Cabin Republicans  Tampa Bay Log Cabin Republicans  Central / Orlando Log Cabin Republicans * Georgia Log Cabin Republicans * Illinois Log Cabin Republicans * Iowa Log Cabin Republicans * Louisiana Log Cabin Republicans * Maryland Log Cabin Republicans * Massachusetts Log Cabin Republicans * Michigan Log Cabin Republicans * Minnesota Log Cabin Republicans * Nevada Log Cabin Republicans * New Hampshire Log Cabin Republicans * New York Log Cabin Republicans  Hudson Valley Log Cabin Republicans  New York City Log Cabin Republicans * North Carolina Log Cabin Republicans * Ohio Log Cabin Republicans  Cleveland Log Cabin Republicans  Northeast Ohio Log Cabin Republicans * Oklahoma Log Cabin Republicans * Oregon Log Cabin Republicans * Pennsylvania Log Cabin Republicans * Rhode Island Log Cabin Republicans * South Carolina Log Cabin Republicans * Texas Log Cabin Republicans  Austin Log Cabin Republicans  Dallas Log Cabin Republicans  Houston Log Cabin Republicans  San Antonio Log Cabin Republicans * Utah Log Cabin Republicans * Virginia Log Cabin Republicans  Northern Virginia Log Cabin Republicans  Richmond Log Cabin Republicans * Washington Log Cabin Republicans * Wisconsin Log Cabin Republicans Criticism LCR has been criticized for failing to promote Republican principles. Focusing on \\"the battle for gay and lesbian civil rights\\" at its March‚ÄìApril 2005 convention and Liberty Education Forum National Symposium, panel topics included \\"Corporate Diversity\\"; \\"Family Fairness\\"; and \\"Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?\\" This caused two Washington Post opinion columnists to observe that \\"the Log Cabin Republicans are looking less and less Republican.\\" In 2012, the Log Cabin Republicans were criticized by advocates of gay rights and marriage equality for endorsing Republican candidates who advocated new limitations on the legal rights of gay Americans as well as the retention of current discriminatory laws and policies. Some in the LGBT community have expressed dissatisfaction with the LCR, viewing it as a centrist organization that does not represent LGBT conservatives. In 2009, two former LCR members, Christopher R. Barron and Jimmy LaSalvia, formed GOProud to represent LGBT conservatives and libertarians; it was dissolved in 2014. LCR president Greg Angelo described the \\"preservation of LGBT rights and support for the LGBT community\\" as hallmarks of Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, and asserted that support would continue during his presidency. On that same day as these comments were made, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had rescinded Obama-era guidance on transgender students' rights. David Badash, editor-in-chief and founder of the New Civil Rights Movement has criticized the LCR for not opposing this action. In 2017, Angelo described Trump as \\"the most pro-LGBT Republican president in history.\\" In a February 2018 interview, he said that Trump recognizes marriage equality as the \\"settled law of the land, sent a letter of congratulations and commemoration [on Log Cabin‚Äôs 40th anniversary], and has people in his Cabinet who support marriage equality.\\" Angelo therefore concluded that \\"Trump is even better for the LGBTQ community than former President Barack Obama,\\" because Obama did not recognize marriage equality as \\"settled law\\" when he was inaugurated in 2009. (The Supreme Court did not rule until 2015.)

The style and form are typical of the mystical tradition, as early theologians began to fuse emerging pre-Enlightenment concepts of classification and organization with religion and alchemy, to shape an artful and perhaps more conceptual view of God. There are various names of God', many of which enumerate the various qualities of a Supreme Being. The English word \\"God\\" (and its equivalent in other languages) is used by multiple religions as a noun or name to refer to different deities, or specifically to the Supreme Being, as denoted in English by the capitalized and uncapitalized terms \\"God\\" and \\"god\\". Ancient cognate equivalents for the biblical Hebrew Elohim, one of the most common names of God in the Bible, include proto-Semitic El, biblical Aramaic Elah, and Arabic ilah. The personal or proper name for God in many of these languages may either be distinguished from such attributes, or homonymic. For example, in Judaism the tetragrammaton is sometimes related to the ancient Hebrew ehyeh (\\"I will be\\"). In the Hebrew Bible (), Yahweh, the personal name of God, is revealed directly to Moses. Correlation between various theories and interpretation of the name of \\"the one God\\", used to signify a monotheistic or ultimate Supreme Being from which all other divine attributes derive, has been a subject of ecumenical discourse between Eastern and Western scholars for over two centuries.Jordan, Mark D. (1983), The Names of God and the Being of Names, in The Existence and Nature of God, edited by Alfred J. Freddoso, pp. 161‚Äì190. University of Notre Dame Press. In Christian theology the word must be a personal and a proper name of God; hence it cannot be dismissed as mere metaphor.(PDF) Sacraments of the Incarnate Word: The Christological Form of the Summa theologiae C Wells, Etd.nd.edu On the other hand, the names of God in a different tradition are sometimes referred to by symbols.Aiyadurai Jesudasen Appasamy, G. S. S. Sreenivasa Rao, Inter-faith dialogue and world community. Christian Literature Society for India (1991) \\"All these names of God are, of course, symbols. ... All names of the one God or the Absolute are symbols.\\" p. 9 The question whether divine names used by different religions are equivalent has been raised and analyzed.Peter C. Phan Being religious interreligiously: Asian perspectives on interfaith dialogue. 2004 p.102 Exchange of names held sacred between different religious traditions is typically limited. Other elements of religious practice may be shared, especially when communities of different faiths are living in close proximity (for example, the use of Om and Krishna within the Indian Christian community) but usage of the names themselves mostly remains within the domain of a particular religion, or even may help define one's religious belief according to practice, as in the case of the recitation of names of God (such as the japa).Jerald D. Gort On sharing religious experience: possibilities of interfaith mutuality p.146 Encounter of Religions Research Group Rodopi, 1992 Guru Gobind Singh's Jaap Sahib, which contains 950 names of God. The Divine Names, the classic treatise by Pseudo-Dionysius, defines the scope of traditional understandings in Western traditions such as Hellenic, Christian, Jewish and Islamic theology on the nature and significance of the names of God.Paul Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius: a commentary on the texts and an introduction to their influence. Oxford University Press, 1993, p.163 Further historical lists such as The 72 Names of the Lord show parallels in the history and interpretation of the name of God amongst Kabbalah, Christianity, and Hebrew scholarship in various parts of the Mediterranean world.Valentina Izmirlieva, All the names of the Lord: lists, mysticism, and magic, University of Chicago Press, 2008 The attitude as to the transmission of the name in many cultures was surrounded by secrecy. In Judaism, the pronunciation of the name of God has always been guarded with great care. It is believed that, in ancient times, the sages communicated the pronunciation only once every seven years;James Orr The International Standard Bible encyclopaedia Edition: ‚ÄîItem notes: v. 1‚Äî1959 1915 p. 1267 this system was challenged by more recent movements. The nature of a holy name can be described as either personal or attributive. In many cultures it is often difficult to distinguish between the personal and the attributive names of God, the two divisions necessarily shading into each other.John S. Mbiti. Concepts of God in Africa. p.217, 1970  Abrahamic religions   Judaism  El comes from a root word meaning might, strength, power . Sometimes referring to God and sometimes the mighty when used to refer to the God of Israel, El is almost always qualified by additional words that further define the meaning that distinguishes him from false gods. A common title of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù). The root Eloah (◊ê◊ú◊î) is used in poetry and late prose (e.g., the Book of Job) and ending with the masculine plural suffix \\"-im\\" ◊ô◊ù creating a word like ba\`alim (\\"owner(s)\\" and adonim (\\"lord(s), master(s)\\") that may also indicate a singular identity. In the Book of Exodus, God commands Moses to tell the people that 'I AM' sent him, and this is revered as one of the most important names of God according to Mosaic tradition. In , when Moses first spoke with God, God said, \\"I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai, but I did not make myself known to them by my name YHWH.\\" YHWH () is the proper name of God in Judaism. Neither vowels nor vowel points were used in ancient Hebrew writings and the original vocalisation of YHWH has been lost.\\"How the Name was originally vocalized is no longer certain. Its pronunciation was in time restricted to the Temple service, then to the High Priest intoning it on the Day of Atonement, after, and after the destruction of the Temple it received a substitute pronunciation both for the reading of Scripture and for its use at prayer.\\" Later commentaries additionally suggested that the true pronunciation of this name is composed entirely of vowels, such as the Greek ŒôŒ±ŒøœÖŒµ. However, this is put into question by the fact that vowels were only distinguished in the time-period by their very absence due to the lack of explicit vowels in the Hebrew script. The resulting substitute made from semivowels and glottals, known as the tetragrammaton, is not ordinarily permitted to be pronounced aloud, even in prayer. The prohibition on misuse (not use) of this name is the primary subject of the command not to take the name of the Lord in vain. Instead of pronouncing YHWH during prayer, Jews say \\"Adonai\\" (\\"Lord\\"). Halakha requires that secondary rules be placed around the primary law, to reduce the chance that the main law will be broken. As such, it is common religious practice to restrict the use of the word \\"Adonai\\" to prayer only. In conversation, many Jewish people, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God HaShem (◊î◊©◊ù), which is Hebrew for \\"the Name\\" (this appears in ). Almost all Orthodox Jews avoid using either Yahweh or Jehovah altogether on the basis that the actual pronunciation of the tetragrammaton has been lost in antiquity. Many use the term HaShem as an indirect reference, or they use \\"God\\" or \\"The Lord\\" instead.  Christianity  Some biblical scholars say YHWH was most likely pronounced Yahweh. References, such as The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, validate the above by offering additional specifics to its (Christian) reconstruction out of Greek sources: > Early Christian writers, such as Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, > had used a form like Yahweh, and claim that this pronunciation of the > tetragrammaton was never really lost. Other Greek transcriptions also > indicated that YHWH should be pronounced Yahweh.The New Encyclop√¶dia > Britannica, Vol. 12, 1998, Chicago, IL, article \\"Yahweh,\\" p. 804. The Hebrew theonyms Elohim and YHWH are mostly rendered as \\"God\\" and \\"the \\" respectively, although in the Protestant tradition of Christianity the personal names Yahweh and Jehovah are sometimes used. \\"Jehovah\\"\\"The Masoretes who vocalized the Hebrew text took the vowels from the word Adonai (◊ê÷≤◊ì÷π◊†÷∏◊ô) and put them with ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (together: ◊ô÷∞◊î÷π◊ï÷∏◊î) to remind the reader not to pronounce the name but to substitute Adonai. A Christian writer of the sixteenth century who was unaware of this substitution transcribed the word as he saw it, namely as Jehovah, and this error has since entered many Christian Bibles [5]. 5. Only rarely has the pronunciation Jehovah been given scholarly endorsement; one exception is J. Neubauer, Bibelwissenschaftliche Irrungen (Berlin: Louis Lamm, 1917), who bases his opinion on Jerusalem Talmud San.. 10:1, describing the controversy between the Rabbanites and the Samaritans over the proniunciation. M. S. Enslin, The Prophet from Nazareth (New York: Schocken, 1968), p. 19, n. 7, calls the vocalization Jehovah an ‚Äúorthoepic monstrosity.‚Äù\\" appears in the Tyndale Bible, the King James Version, and other translations from that time period and later. Many English translations of the Bible translate the tetragrammaton as , thus removing any form of YHWH from the written text and going well beyond the Jewish oral practice of substituting Adonai for YHWH when reading aloud. English Bible translations of the Greek New Testament render ho theos (Greek: Œü ŒòŒµœåœÇ) as God and ho kurios (Greek: Œü ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ) as \\"the Lord\\". Jesus (Iesus, YeshuaYeshua (, with vowel pointing - yƒì≈°≈´ƒÉ‚Äò in Hebrew) Strong's Yeshuwa) was a common alternative form of the name (\\"Yehoshua\\" - Joshua) in later books of the Hebrew Bible and among Jews of the Second Temple period. The name corresponds to the Greek spelling Iesous, from which comes the English spelling Jesus. \\"Christ\\" means \\"the anointed\\" in Greek (). Khristos is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Messiah; while in English the old Anglo-Saxon Messiah-rendering h√¶land (healer) was practically annihilated by the Latin \\"Christ\\", some cognates such as heiland in Dutch and Afrikaans survive‚Äîalso, in German, the word Heiland is sometimes used as reference to Jesus, e.g., in church chorals). In the Book of Revelation in the Christian New Testament, God is quoted as saying \\"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End\\". (cf. , , and ) Some Quakers refer to God as The Light. Another term used is King of Kings or Lord of Lords and Lord of Hosts. Other names used by Christians include Ancient of Days, Father/Abba which is Hebrew, \\"Most High\\" and the Hebrew names Elohim, El-Shaddai, Yahweh, Jehovah and Adonai. Abba (Father in Hebrew) is a common term used for the creator within Christianity because it was a title Jesus used to refer to God the Father. Guƒë√°n is the Proto-Germanic word for God. It was inherited by the Germanic languages in Gud in modern Scandinavian; God in Frisian, Dutch, and English; and Gott in modern German. Deus is the Latin word for God. It was inherited by the Romance languages in Deus in modern Portuguese; Dios in Spanish; Dieu in French; Dio in Italian; and Dumnezeu in Romanian. Bog is the word for God in most Slavic languages. (Cyrillic script: –ë–æ–≥; Czech: B≈Øh; Polish: B√≥g; Slovak: Boh). The term is derived from Proto-Slavic *bog—ä, which originally meant \\"earthly wealth/well- being; fortune\\", with a semantic shift to \\"dispenser of wealth/fortune\\" and finally \\"god\\". The term may have originally been a borrowing from the Iranian languages. Sh√†ngd√¨ (‰∏äÂ∏ù pinyin sh√†ng d√¨, literally 'King Above') is used to refer to the Christian God in the Standard Chinese Union Version of the Bible. Sh√©n Á•û (lit. \\"God\\", \\"spirit\\", or \\"deity\\") was adopted by Protestant missionaries in China to refer to the Christian God. In this context it is usually rendered with a space, \\" Á•û\\", to demonstrate reverence. Zh≈≠ and TiƒÅnzh«î ‰∏ª,Â§©‰∏ª (lit. \\"Lord\\" or \\"Lord in Heaven\\") are equivalent to \\"Lord\\"; these names are used as formal titles of the Christian God in Mainland China's Christian churches. Korean Catholics also use the Korean cognate of TiƒÅnzh≈≠, Cheon-ju (Ï≤úÏ£º), as the primary reference to God in both ritual/ceremonial and vernacular (but mostly ritual/ceremonial) contexts. Korean Catholics and Anglicans also use a cognate of the Chinese Sh√†ngd√¨ (Sangje ÏÉÅÏ†ú), but this has largely fallen out of regular use in favor of Cheon-ju. But now used is the vernacular Haneunim (ÌïòÎäêÎãò), the traditional Korean name for the God of Heaven. Korean Orthodox Christians also use Haneunim, but not Sangje or Cheon-ju, and with exception of Anglicans, most Korean Protestants do not use Sangje or Haneunim at all but instead use Hananim (ÌïòÎÇòÎãò), which stemmed from Pyongan dialect for Haneunim. Many Vietnamese Christians also use cognates of Sh√†ngd√¨ (expected to have a distribution in usage similar to Korean Christians, with Anglicans and Catholics using the cognates of Sangje in ritual/ceremonial contexts and Protestants not using it at all), to refer to the biblical God. Tagalog- speaking Filipino Catholics and other Christians use Maykapal (glossed as \\"creator\\") ‚Äì an epithet originally applied to the pre-colonial supreme deity Bathala ‚Äì to refer to the Christian godhead in most contexts. When paired with another term for God (e.g. Panginoong Maykapal \\"Lord Creator\\", Amang Maykapal \\"Father Creator\\"), it functions as a descriptor much like the adjectives in the English \\"God Almighty\\" or Latin Omnipotens Deus. Among the Nguni peoples of Southern Africa, he is known as Nkosi (roughly glossed as \\"king\\"). This name is used in Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Followers of Rastafari call God Jah, which is derived from \\"Jehovah\\".  Mormonism  In Mormonism the name of God the Father is Elohim First Presidency and Council of the Twelve, 1916, \\"God the Father,\\" compiled by Gordon Allred, p. 150 and the name of Jesus in his pre-incarnate state was Jehovah.Moroni 10:34Old Testament Institute Manual:Genesis to 2 Samuel‚Äî\\"Who is the God of the Old Testament?\\" Together, with the Holy Ghost they form the Godhead; God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Mormons typically refer to God as \\"Heavenly Father\\" or \\"Father in Heaven\\". Although Mormonism views the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three distinct beings, they are one in purpose and God the Father (Elohim) is worshipped and given all glory through his Son, Jesus Christ (Jehovah). Despite the Godhead doctrine, which teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are three separate, divine beings, many Mormons (mainstream Latter-day Saints and otherwise, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) view their beliefs as monotheist since Christ is the conduit through which humanity comes to the God the Father. The Book of Mormon ends with \\"to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the eternal Judge of both the quick and dead. Amen.\\"  Jehovah's Witnesses  Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God has only one distinctive name, represented in the Old Testament by the tetragrammaton. In English, they prefer to use the form Jehovah. According to Jehovah's Witnesses, the name Jehovah means \\"He causes to become\\". Scriptures frequently cited in support of the name include Isaiah 42:8: \\"I am Jehovah. That is my name\\", Psalms 83:18: \\"May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth\\", and Exodus 6:3: \\"And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.\\" While opposers of the faith critique their use of the form ‚ÄúJehovah‚Äù, Jehovah's Witnesses still hold on to their belief that, despite having scholars prefer the ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù pronunciation, the name Jehovah adequately transmits the idea behind the meaning of God's name in English. While they don't discourage the use of the ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù pronunciation, they highly consider the long history of the name Jehovah in the English language and see that it sufficiently identifies God's divine persona. This rationale is analogous to the widespread use of Jesus as the English translation of Yehoshua.  Islam  99 names of Allah, in Chinese Sini (script). Allah‚Äîmeaning \\"the god\\" in Arabic‚Äîis the name of God in Islam.\\"Allah.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The word Allah has been used by Arabic people of different religions since pre-Islamic times. More specifically, it has been used as a term for God by Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) and Arab Christians. God has many names in Islam, the Qur'an says (translation) to Him Belong the Best Names (Lahu Al-Asma' Al- Husna), examples like Ar-Rahman (The Entirely Merciful), Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful). Beside these Arabic names, Muslims of non-Arab origins may also sometimes use other names in their own languages to refer to God, such as Khuda in Persian, Bengali and Urdu. Tangri or Tengri was used in the Ottoman Turkish language as the equivalent of Allah.  Sufism  In Tasawwuf, the inner, mystical dimension of Islam, Hu, Huwa (depends on placement in sentence), or Parvardigar in Persian are used as names of God. The sound Hu derives from the last letter of the word Allah, which is read as Allahu when in the middle of a sentence. Hu means Just He or Revealed. The word explicitly appears in many verses of the Quran:  Bah√° º√≠ Faith  The scriptures of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith often refer to God by various titles and attributes, such as Almighty, All-Possessing, All-Powerful, All-Wise, Incomparable, Gracious, Helper, All-Glorious, and Omniscient. Bah√° º√≠s believe the Greatest Name of God is \\"All-Glorious\\" or ' in Arabic. ' is the root word of the following names and phrases: the greeting ' (God is the All-Glorious), the invocation ' (O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious), ' (The Glory of God), and Bah√° º√≠ (Follower of the All-Glorious). These are expressed in Arabic regardless of the language in use (see Bah√° º√≠ symbols). Apart from these names, God is addressed in the local language, for example Ishwar in Hindi, Dieu in French and Dios in Spanish. Bah√° º√≠s believe Bah√°'u'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, is the \\"complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God\\". Mandaeism Mandaeans believe in one God called Hayyi Rabbi (The Great Life or The Great Living God). Other names for God used include Mare d'Rabuta (Lord of Greatness), Mana Rabba (The Great Mind), Melka d'Nhura (King of Light) and Hayyi Qadmaiyi (The First Life).Rudolf, K. (1978). Mandaeism. Leiden: Brill. Mandaeans believe that there is a constant battle or conflict between the forces of good and evil. The forces of good are represented by Nhura (Light) and Maia Hayyi (Living Water) and those of evil are represented by Hshuka (Darkness) and Maia Tahmi (dead or rancid water). The two waters are mixed in all things in order to achieve a balance. Mandaeans believe in an afterlife or heaven called Alma d'Nhura (World of Light). Hinduism There are multiple names for God's various manifestations worshiped in Hinduism. Some of the common names for these Deities in Hinduism are: * Bhagavan (‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§®) the most frequently used name for God in Hinduism. The equivalent term used for female deities is Bhagavati(‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä). * Brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) is a theological concept espoused in Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, which is of neuter gender. The word Paramatman(‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) popularly pronounced as Paramatma (‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ) is also used synonymously with it. The word is used to denote the Supreme Divinity/Supreme Soul. * Isvara (‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) shortened as Isha (‡§à‡§∂) is applied to mean \\"lord\\" in both religious and secular context(for example in the Gita, Arjuna is referred to as \\"Manujeshvara\\" which is a compound of the 2 words \\"Manuja\\" i.e human and \\"Ishvara\\", thus the word means \\"lord of humans\\" i.e king). The term Parameshvara (Supreme Lord) is used to refer to one's Ishta(chosen deity for personal veneration) in general terms. The feminine equivalents are Isvari(‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä) and Parameshvari(‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä) used in case of female deities. * Deva/Devata(‡§¶‡•á‡§µ/‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§§‡§æ) is most commonly used suffix used for male deities in Hinduism. The feminine equivalent is Devi(‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•Ä). Additionally, most Hindu deities have a collection of 8/12/16/32/100/108/1000/1008 names exclusively dedicated to them known as Namavali. Arya Samaj Maharishi Dayanand in his book Vaghasiya Ayush has listed 100 names of God each representing some property or attribute thereof mentioning ‚ÄúOm or Aum‚Äù as God's personal and natural name. Chanting \\"Om\\" and other Sanskrit mantras has proven to be beneficial. Jainism Jainism rejects the idea of a creator deity responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and an immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings (devas), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die. Jains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, Perfect knowledge and Perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to karmas of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed as god. This perfection of soul is called Kaivalya (Omniscience). A liberated soul thus becomes a god ‚Äì liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, karmas and finally liberated of body as well. This is called nirvana or moksha. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods/Tirthankara. Thus, Rishabhanatha was god/Tirthankara but he was not the only Tirthankara; there were many other Tirthankara. However, the quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self- regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is called as observing the Mahavrata (\\"Great Vows\\"). Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as Tƒ´rthankaras and Arihantas or ordinary Kevalis, and non-embodied formless gods who are called Siddhas. Jainism considers the devƒ´s and devas to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve moksha. Sikhism There are multiple names for God in Sikhism. Some of the popular names for God in Sikhism are: * Akal Purakh, meaning timeless being. * Ik Onkar, One Creator, found at the beginning of the Sikh Mul Mantar. * Nirankar, meaning formless * Satnam meaning True Name, some are of the opinion that this is a name for God in itself, others believe that this is an adjective used to describe the \\"Gurmantar\\", Waheguru. * Waheguru, meaning Wonderful Teacher bringing light to remove darkness, this name is considered the greatest among Sikhs, and it is known as Gurmantar, the Guru's Word. Waheguru is the only way to meet God in Sikhism. * DƒÅtƒÅ or DƒÅtƒÅr, meaning the Giver * KartƒÅ or KartƒÅr, meaning the Doer * DiƒÅl, meaning compassionate * KirpƒÅl, meaning benevolent In the Sikh scripture, both Hindu and Muslim names of the Supreme Being are also commonly employed, expressing different aspects of the divine Name. For instance, names like Ram (pervading), Hari (shining), Parmeshwar (supreme lord), and Jagdish (world lord) refer to Hindu terms, while names like Allah (Arabic for God), Khuda (Persian for God), Rahim (merciful), Karim (generous), and Sahib (lord) are of Muslim origin.Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , page 228 God, according to Guru Nanak, is beyond full comprehension by humans; has endless number of virtues; takes on innumerable forms, but is formless; and can be called by an infinite number of names thus \\"Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how many Glorious Virtues You have.\\"Guru Granth Sahib p. 358 The word Allah (‡®Ö‡®≤‡®π‡©Å) is used 12 times in the Guru Granth Sahib by Sheikh Farid. Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Bhagat Kabeer used the word 18 times. Yazidism Yazidism knows only one eternal God often named Xwed√™. According to some Yazidi hymns (known as Qewls), God has 1001 names. Zoroastrianism In Zoroastrianism, 101 names of God (Pazand Sad-o-yak nam-i-khoda) is a list of names of God (Ahura Mazda). The list is preserved in Persian, Pazand and Gujarati. Parsi tradition expanded this to a list of \\"101 names of God\\".Antonio Panaino, The lists of names of Ahura MazdƒÅ (Ya≈°t I) and Vayu (Ya≈°t XV), 2002, p. 20.

It features the misadventures of the titular fireman and had the longest run of any comic strip in the \\"screwball comics\\" genre. Overview Holman was born in Crawfordsville, Indiana and moved to Chicago, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts while working as an office boy in the Chicago Tribune art department. He relocated to New York City where he worked as a staff artist at the New York Herald Tribune and submitted freelance cartoons to magazines, including Colliers, The Saturday Evening Post, Life, Judge, and Everybody's Weekly. He began Smokey Stover as a Sunday comic strip for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate on March 10, 1935. The daily comic strip began on November 14, 1938. Puns and \\"wallnuts\\" The panels of Smokey Stover regularly include sight gags, mishaps, absurd vehicles, and bizarre household items, including oddly shaped furniture, clocks, vases, headwear, cigarette holders, and telephones. Framed pictures on the walls change completely from panel to panel or feature the subjects literally jumping out of the frames. The strip also abounds in nonsensical dialogue, non-sequiturs, and puns. The puns and \\"silly pictures on the wall with various items hanging clear out of the frames\\" was the feature that provoked the most reader mail, according to articles and interviews with Holman. The cartoonist often visited the syndicate office to pick up the puns which readers suggested for the walls. He called these items \\"wallnuts\\". For example, a picture of a fish opening a door is labeled \\"calling cod\\".\\"Smokey Stover Artist's a Pun & Ink Genius\\" by Leslie Monypenny, Chicago Daily Tribune, 28 January 29, 1952. Jocular jargon and peculiar phrases 1946 strip as reprinted in issue 64 of the Smokey Stover comic book. The comic strip featured signs with strange nonsense words and phrases, such as \\"foo\\", \\"notary sojac\\", \\"scram gravy ain't wavey\\", and \\"1506 nix nix\\", and some became catchphrases. Holman defined \\"notary sojac\\" as Gaelic for \\"Merry Christmas\\" (Nodlaig Sodhach), and \\"1506 nix nix\\" was reportedly a private joke that included the hotel room number of cartoonist Al Posen, Holman's friend.Scoop: Bill Holman His most frequent nonsense word was \\"foo\\", and Holman peppered his work with foo labels and puns.See for instance Holman, \\"Smokey Stover-A Dead Ringer\\", Daily News, November 21, 1938, retrieved 6 Feb 2009, Holman, \\"Smokey Stover-Movie Idle\\", Daily News, November 23, 1938, retrieved 6 Feb 2009Moira Davison Reynolds, Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945‚Äì1980, p94, McFarland, 2003 .Coulton Waugh, The Comics, p316. University Press of Mississippi, 1991. (Reprint; first published in 1947). The term spread in popular culture during the 1930s and found use in 1938‚Äì39 Warner Brothers cartoons, most notably by director Bob Clampett, including Porky in Wackyland.The Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion Harvey Kurtzman claimed that the comic influenced him to use nonsense words and fill the corner panels of MAD Magazine with \\"nonsensical details\\". Smokey \\"often called himself a foo fighter when anyone else would have said firefighter\\", according to comics historian Don Markstein.Smokey Stover at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 21, 2015. \\"The word foo also turned up on signs, lists, menus, and the lips of various characters at random but frequent intervals.\\" Foo may have been inspired by the French word feu meaning \\"fire\\", as Smokey's catch phrase was \\"where there's foo, there's fire\\", but Holman never gave a straight answer as to the origin. Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in Chinatown, San Francisco, meaning \\"good luck\\".\\"The History of Bill Holman\\", Smokey-Stover.com, Smokey Stover LLC ‚Äì article by nephew of Bill Holman\\"Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion\\"Raymond, Eric S. The New Hacker's Dictionary, MIT Press, 1996. This is presumably a transliteration of the fu character (f√∫, Á¶è), which is a common character for fortune, and figurines are common in Chinese communities featuring the \\"star god\\" F√∫, L√π, Sh√≤u. Foo fighters During World War II, images of Smokey Stover and Spooky were painted as nose art on several American bomber aircraft. The term \\"foo\\" was borrowed directly from Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the U.S. 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who it is agreed by most 415th members gave the \\"foo fighters\\" their name.Jeffery A Lindell, 1991. \\"Interviews with Harold Augspurger, Commander 415th Night Fighter Squadron; Frederic Ringwald, S-2 Intelligence Officer, 415th Night Fighter Squadron The phrase foo fighter, also taken from Holman's strip, was used by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II to describe various unidentified flying objects or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations. Though foo fighter initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the 415th Squadron, the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period. Foo Fighters is also the name of a rock band, first heard in 1995. Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release recordings under the title \\"Foo Fighters\\", taken from the World War II term for UFOs and indirectly from Holman's strip. Alternate strips Spooky Holman launched an accompanying topper strip called Spooky one month later (April 7, 1935), to run with Smokey Stover on Sundays. With a perpetually bandaged tail, the peculiar black cat Spooky lives with his owner Fenwick Flooky, who does embroidery while characteristically wearing a fez and sitting barefoot in a rocking chair. Holman used the pseudonym \\"Scat H.\\" to sign the strip. The topper ran until the strip ended in 1972. Nuts and Jolts Spooky, who makes frequent cameo appearances in Smokey Stover, also regularly turns up in the background of Holman's daily gag panel feature, Nuts and Jolts. Syndicated for more than three decades from July 8, 1935 to 1970, Nuts and Jolts was a stand-alone panel cartoon featuring an ever-changing cast of everyday people doing silly things. Comic books and reprints There were several Smokey Stover comic books published by Dell Comics Four Color. The first in this series, No. 7 (1942), displayed an unusual front cover of a full seven-panel sequence, a rarity in comic book covers. The next in the Dell series, No. 35 (1944), was followed by No. 64 (February 1945), No. 229 (May 1949), No. 730 (October 1956) and No. 827 (August 1957). (Cartoonist Hy Eisman has said he drew the Smokey Stover content in Four Color No. 730.A Profile of Hy Eisman, Hogan's Alley #15) In 1953‚Äì54, Holman produced two public services giveaway comic books on fire safety, both published by the National Fire Protection Association. *Smokey Stover: Firefighter of Foo (1937) Whitman Publishing *Smokey Stover and the Fire Chief of Foo (Penny Book, 1938) Whitman *Smokey Stover: The Foo Fighter (Big Little Book #1421, 1938) Whitman *Smokey Stover: The False Alarm Fireman (Better Little Book #1413, 1941) Whitman *Smokey Stover: The Foolish Foo Fighter (Better Little Book #1481, 1945) Whitman *Bill Holman's Smokey Stover: Book 1 (1985) Blackthorne Publishing (a trade paperback of black & white reprints with an introduction by Harvey Kurtzman) *Screwball Comics: The First Nemo Annual (1985) Fantagraphics (an anthology of vintage comics also featuring Rube Goldberg, Milt Gross and Dr. Seuss) *Smokey Stover and Spooky the Cat: The Collected Sundays (2012) Hermes Press Animation and oddities *A novelty song based on Smokey Stover‚Äî\\"What This Country Needs Is Foo\\", with words and \\"FOOsic\\" by Mack Kay‚Äîwas recorded by Eddie DeLange and His Orchestra on Bluebird Records in 1939.

Knight and Walter J. Pictrowski designed and built a three-wheeled version of Smokey Stover's Foo Mobile. With permission and suggestions from Holman, the vehicle was adorned with familiar paraphernalia, such as a rubber-handled ax, a fire call box, a fire gong, crank handle and steam-generating radiator cap (a fire nozzle with the slogan \\"Sea-Oh-Too!\\"). The Foo Car has been in and out of service over the years and has been restored twice, brought back for appearances at Berkshire area parades, musters and charity events.

After two albums on Capitol records‚ÄîReady to Strike (November 9, 1985) and Thrill of a Lifetime (1986)‚Äîand an independent release entitled King Kobra III in 1988, Appice decided to dissolve the band and join guitarist John Sykes on his Blue Murder project in 1989. In 2010, a new King Kobra emerged, with Carmine Appice on drums, Paul Shortino taking over vocal duties, Mick Sweda on guitar, David Henzerling (a.k.a. David Michael-Philips) on guitar, and Johnny Rod on bass. This lineup released an eponymous album, King Kobra, in 2011 on Frontiers Records, and another album in 2013 entitled King Kobra II.

Geography The sound is bounded by Choiseul Island, Santa Isabel Island, and Florida Island to the north, and by Vella Lavella, Kolombangara, New Georgia, and the Russell Islands to the south. Bougainville Island of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (Papua New Guinea) and Guadalcanal island, define northwestern and southeastern ends of the sound, respectively. It is one of three major routes for merchant shipping through the Solomon Islands archipelago. The two others are: the Bougainville Strait and Indispensable Strait route which links the Pacific Ocean, Solomon Sea and Coral Sea; and the Manning Strait route, which links the Pacific to New Georgia Sound. Savo Island, a volcanic cone northwest of Guadalcanal, is a topographically significant island in the eastern region. History Captain Edward Manning sailed Pitt through the sound in 1792, on his way to Bengal in British India after having delivered convicts to Port Jackson in New South Wales, colonial Australia. WWII‚ÄîThe Slot During the WWII Pacific War the New Georgia Sound was known as \\"The Slot\\" by Allied combatants due to its geographical shape and the amount of warship traffic that traversed it.

The most ancient lineages of the family show a Gondwanan distribution and have been used as evidence of continental drift. Members of the Pheretima group of genera (e.g. Amynthas) are widely distributed around the tropics, much as some Lumbricidae are distributed through the temperate zones. Some North American native genera - e.g., Arctiostrotus, Argilophilus and Driloleirus - also belong to this family. The members of this family have the typical \\"megascolecine\\" arrangement of male pores, with vasa deferentia and prostatic ducts uniting before opening via a combined pore on segment 18, rather than the \\"acanthodriline\\" arrangement (with male pores and pores from one or more pairs of prostates opening separately near segment 18, but never combined on segment 18) as found in the related families Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae and Exxidae. Megascolecidae genera are either meroic (with multiple nephridia per segment), or have the plesiomorphic holoic arrangement of two nephridia per segment. Some taxa also exhibit enteronephry, where some nephridia, instead of emptying to the body surface, empty into the digestive tract. Setae may be lumbricine (plesiomorphic, eight per segment) or perichaetine (more than eight setae per segment).

It was intended to test the feasibility of full yaw, pitch and roll authority without tailplanes (horizontal or vertical). Attitude control relies purely on 3D thrust vectoring. The aircraft design was derived from the F-22 Raptor and featured a stretched delta wing without tail surfaces. Design and development The X-44 was designed by Lockheed Martin to demonstrate the feasibility of an aircraft controlled by vectored thrust alone. The X-44 design had a reduced radar signature (due to lack of tail and vertical stabilizers) and was made more efficient by eliminating the tail and rudder surfaces, and instead using thrust vectors to provide yaw, pitch and roll control. The X-44 MANTA design was based on the F-22, except without a tail and incorporating a full delta wing. The basic X-44 MANTA would entail a larger weapons payload and a greater fuel capacity than the F-22, due to its larger delta wing design.

The name Midhurst was first recorded in 1186 as Middeherst, meaning \\"Middle wooded hill\\", or \\"(place) among the wooded hills\\". It derives from the Old English words midd (adjective) or mid (preposition), meaning \\"in the middle\\", plus hyrst, \\"a wooded hill\\".Mills, A.D., Dictionary of British Place Names. Retrieved 3 June 2015. The Norman St. Ann's Castle dates from about 1120, although the foundations are all that can now be seen. The castle, the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Denis, together with South Pond, the former fish-pond for the castle, are the only three structures left from this early period. The parish church is the oldest building in Midhurst. Just across the River Rother, in the parish of Easebourne, is the ruin of the Tudor Cowdray House.  Governance   National  The former Parliamentary Constituency of Midhurst is now an electoral ward of the Parliamentary Constituency of Chichester, and has been represented in the House of Commons since 2017 by Conservative MP Gillian Keegan.  Local  Midhurst is part of the Chichester District of West Sussex County, governed by the Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council respectively. Midhurst is represented by two councillors on the Chichester District Council, both of them Independent.  Parish  The Old Library, Midhurst, now the Town Council offices The Midhurst Town Council meets monthly and comprises 15 directly elected members. The May 2015 election was uncontested as there were 13 nominations for the 15 seats, and therefore 2 vacancies. Four of these were women (31%). Various changes have occurred since the election. The Council is led by a Chairperson nominated by the councillors from among themselves. The Council is supported by a staff of two: the Town Clerk (and Responsible Finance Officer) and an Assistant Town Clerk. There are three Council Committees: Finance, Asset and Policy (meets monthly), Community and Environment (meets monthly) and Planning and Infrastructure, which has an advisory function only to the principal planning authorities (Chichester District Council and the South Downs National Park Authority) (meets fortnightly). The times and dates of meetings, the minutes of meetings and other information is available on the Town Council website. The Midhurst Town Council organises a community street party every December, an annual \\"Midhurst in Bloom\\" competition, a carnival parade on August Bank Holiday, to coincide with the Grand Finale of the MADhurst Festival (see below), and a \\"Spring Clean-up\\" around the town. The council is responsible for the town recreation ground and the town cemetery, and provides grants to various local clubs and organisations. In 2014 the Town Council moved from its former offices in Capron House on North Street to the Old Library building on Knockhundred Row. The building is leased from the West Sussex County Council, with a view to its eventual purchase by the Town Council.  Economy  Midhurst is a market town servicing its rural hinterland through many small businesses, shops, restaurants and cafes. Its primary economic activities, in terms of employment, are wholesale and retail businesses including motor mechanics, construction, hotels, food and drink and office administration. In 2011 it had a population of 4,914, comprising 2,434 households (average size 2 people) and 3,477 economically active residents. Of the 1,027 economically inactive residents, 673 (65.5 per cent) were retirees. Between 1913 and 1985, the Midhurst Brickworks, famous for producing \\"Midhurst White\\" bricks, was situated close to the former Midhurst Common railway station. There is an area of light industry in the south of Midhurst, between the Holmbush Estate and Little Midhurst.  Culture and community   Culture  The Midhurst Music, Arts and Drama Festival (MADhurst) is an annual community event that brings together the creative, artistic & musical talent of Midhurst. It takes place at multiple venues in and around Midhurst for ten days every summer, culminating on August Bank Holiday in a Carnival Parade (organised by the Town Council) and Grand Finale celebration with stalls, a music festival, clowns, food and more at the Midhurst Sports Ground. The programme for each festival varies from year to year, but typically includes evening and lunchtime concerts (classical, swing, folk and jazz), an art trail, an artisan fair, a 'family fun day' for young children, theatre and dance performances, a local Gardeners Question Time, a short story competition and numerous workshops on creative skills, plus a range fringe events such as exhibitions, beer festivals, quiz nights, treasure trails and others. The event brings together the whole community to manage the box office, arrange workshops, help with PR and social media, provide security and everything needed for a smooth-running festival ‚Äì a genuine team effort. The Midhurst Medieval Festival takes place annually in the Old Town, in early May, featuring re-enactments, falconry, spinning and weaving demonstrations, have-a-go archery, medieval music, stalls and medieval food. The architectural heritage of Tudor, Georgian and Victorian buildings in Midhurst is considerable, with 94 listed buildings. The Midhurst Society was founded in 1969 to help conserve this heritage. The Society aims to preserve, protect and improve local features of historic or public interest. It promotes high standards of planning and architecture and seeks to enhance the local environment and amenities, in liaison with public authorities. A biannual magazine \\"Midhurst Magazine\\" is published to encourage interest in the local past, present and future. The Knockhundred Shuttles a Midhurst-based mixed Morris Dancing club, meets regularly to practice, and appears in numerous country festivals. The Midhurst Players present 3‚Äì4 amateur dramatic productions each year, the Midhurst Art Society and the Midhurst Camera Club each hold summer exhibitions each year, and the Midhurst Choral Society gives periodic recitals. Filmography: In 2010 Midhurst featured as a set for the television series Foyle's War. In 2014 the Midhurst Together Group facilitated the community production of the \\"Midhurst Happy Video\\", based on the original song by Farrell Williams. Social Media: The town has an internet presence with a Town Council website, a \\"VisitMidhurst\\" website focused on the information needs of tourists, a community Facebook page, Twitter feed and Pinterest page. About ten community organisations are also active on social media, and many of them have websites.\\"Bringing Midhurst Together: a list of Clubs, Societies and Groups that meet in Midhurst\\" (2015). Produced by the Midhurst Together Group  Community facilities  The South Downs National Park, established in 2011, stretches for 87 miles between Winchester in the West to Eastbourne and Beachy Head in the East. It encompasses the whole of the South Downs, together with a significant area of the western Weald to the north of the Downs, as far north as Alice Holt near Farnham. The Park's landscapes cover 1,600km2. The headquarters of the National Park Authority, the South Downs Centre in Capron House, Midhurst is a community hub, an exhibition about the National Park and a green conference centre. It also includes the Midhurst Tourist Information Centre. The Midhurst Town Trust is a charity responsible for maintaining some of Midhurst's community facilities. The Charity Commissioners Scheme for The Midhurst Town Trust was sealed on 4 February 1910, and has governed the activities of the Trust ever since, with one amendment. Certain properties were vested in the Trust to protect, administer and care for. In addition to the Old Town Hall and the Market Square, the commissioners schedule of property included the Stocks, The Pound, The Curfew Garden, the Royal Arms, Town Mace and Constables Staves. The Trustees meet twice a year. There are currently six trustees: one representative of the Lord of the Manor (Lord Cowdray); Three representatives of Midhurst Town Council; and two co-opted trustees who reside in Midhurst. The Grange Leisure Centre was opened on 3 March 2014, replacing a nearby earlier building dating from the 1960s. It is owned by West Sussex County Council and operated by Westgate Leisure. The centre provides a number of services under one roof. It is a meeting-place for a range of clubs, including bridge, badminton, gymnastics, toddlers, line-dancing, yoga and many others. It includes: a multi-purpose four-court sports hall; a fitness room with state of the art Technogym equipment; two squash courts and a squash viewing area; a dance studio with mirrors that is also used for fitness and community activities; a health suite, including a sauna, steam room and a spa pool; a multi-purpose community hall and community rooms; and a bar and caf√© with Wi- Fi access.

History  Midhurst developed as a Saxon village at a strategic crossroads of what are now the A272 (east-west) and A286 (north-south) routes. There may have been a village there since Roman times. After the Norman Conquest Robert de Montgomery ordered the building of a motte-and-bailey castle on what is now called St Ann's Hill, a strategic bluff on a curve of the River Rother, overlooking the cross-roads and a long stretch of Rother Valley to the north, east and the west, protecting the River Rother crossing. St Ann's Hill may also have been the site of an Iron Age fort Although there has been a settlement in Midhurst since at least the early Norman period, and probably from Saxon times, the buildings in the Old Town, centred on the Market Square, are principally Tudor in origin. Almost every house in this part of the town dates back to the 16th Century, and parts of a few buildings, such as the old coaching inn that is now the Spread Eagle Hotel, date to the 15th century. Even the apparently more modern North Street is lined with Tudor buildings behind classical and Georgian fa√ßades that were added during the 17th and 18th centuries, a time of prosperity for the town.Tudor Midhurst. A Midhurst Society Publication (brochure). 2nd Edition 2009 There are also several actual 18th-century buildings scattered throughout the town, and distinctive Victorian and Edwardian developments of terraced housing along the main routes out of Midhurst. During the mid and late 20th Century there was significant housing development to the south of the town, in the Little Midhurst, Holmbush and Fairway areas.  Manorial (pre-modern) period  In 1106 Savaric fitz Cana (Fitzcane) received land in Midhurst and the neighbouring village of Easebourne from Henry 1, and in 1158 his son built a fortified manor house on St. Anne's Hill. The family later adopted the de Bohun name, and in about 1280 abandoned the fortified manor house to build their principal home on flat land across the River Rother from St. Ann's Hill, in the neighbouring parish of Easebourne, 'at a place called Coudreye' (old French for a \\"hazel grove\\"). Between 1284 and 1311 St Ann's Castle was in the hands of the Bishop of Durham, and during that period was largely dismantled.\\"Midhurst\\", in A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, the Rape of Chichester, ed.

Inq. p.m. xii, 127. Footnote 5 in \\"Midhurst\\", in A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, the Rape of Chichester, ed. L F Salzman (London, 1953), pp. 74‚Äì80 [accessed 28 May 2015] There is still a house called Court Green beside the current entrance to the castle enclosure. At some period after this date the chapel of St. Dennis was eventually demolished, and the re-built foundation can be seen within the castle curtain wall. The parish church in Midhurst originated as a medieval chapel dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. In about 1216 the founding charter of a college of priests at Easebourne (re-established about 1230 as a Benedictine nunnery), lists Midhurst amongst its dependent chapels. When Easebourne Priory was suppressed in 1536 and handed to the Fitzwilliam family, the chapel in Midhurst achieved parish church status, and was substantially re-built. The additional dedication of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene to St Denis (also the dedication of the former chapel within the castle) is first recorded in 1764. The little town developed outside the castle, mainly to service it and the immediate surrounding area, and to provide a market place for local agricultural surpluses. It was bounded by an escarpment dropping in the north to the Town Meadow, in the east to the River Rother and in the South to a tributary to the Rother. To the west it was bounded until the late 12th century by a 1.5-metre deep ditch, with a dyke and pallisade, approximately where Duck (or Dyke) Lane now lies. Other than the castle, the principal engine of growth for the town was its regular market, for which the earliest known reference is in 1223. Many of the early buildings were grouped around the market area. These houses were built of highly perishable materials, and none have survived. Most would have been about a perch wide (about 5 metres), with long gardens at the rear, opening onto back lanes. On market days country people would bring their produce to sell at stalls in the open air. Apart from foodstuffs, the principal trades were in wool, cloth and leather, and related trades such as weaving, whitening, quilt- making and cobbling. These were largely determined by the predominance of shepherding in the surrounding agricultural area. Midhurst was a 'free borough' and in 1278 was said to have been so from time beyond memory. It was governed by a bailiff who was elected by the burgesses from among themselves. The bailiff regulated the market by ensuring the assize of bread and ale, appointing two ale-tasters yearly, and acted as clerk of the market. Disputes over the respective rights and duties of town and manor were settled in 1409 by an agreement whereby Michael Bageley and six other named burgesses agreed, on behalf of themselves and their successors, to pay 40 shillings a year to Sir John de Bohun, Lord of the Manor, and his heirs, for the right to take the market tolls. In return they were required to hold both the three-weekly courts and to conduct two 'law days' in the name of Sir John. If they failed for a whole year to hold the courts the agreement should lapse, and if they neglected to keep the streets and ditches in order the lord's manorial officers should be responsible for apprehending offenders, but were required to hand over any fines to the burgesses. This arrangement was confirmed in 1537 by Sir William Fitzwilliam, after his purchase of the manor. Midhurst was first represented in the Parliament of 1301 and was consistently represented from 1382 onwards. From these early beginnings, and until the Great Reform Act of 1832, the town had two members of parliament. The electors were the owners of certain properties, which were marked by \\"burgage stones\\", one of these stones remains and can be seen with a descriptive plaque embedded in the wall of a building just north of the Old Library (Council Offices) on Knockhundred Row.  Early modern period  Cowdray House by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm 1781, from site of modern Polo Ground. St. Ann's Hill is in background, just to right of the House. The event that had the greatest effect on the town in the Tudor period was the re-building of Cowdray House, which commenced in the 1520s. Sir David Owen, illegitimate son of Owen Tudor and uncle to Henry VII, began construction of the building that is now in ruins beside the River Rother, on the site of the former building called Coudreye, which he had acquired upon the death of his wife Mary Bohun. Her family had built the original house there between 1273 and 1284, after they abandoned their original castle on St Ann's Hill. The rebuilding continued after 1529, when Sir David Owen's son sold it to Sir William Fitzwilliam.Footnote 52 in \\"Midhurst\\", in A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, the Rape of Chichester, ed. L F Salzman (London, 1953), pp. 74‚Äì80 [accessed 28 May 2015] The Fitzwilliams were a staunch catholic family, and remained so throughout the English Reformation and beyond, making Midhurst a centre of Catholicism into the 17th century. Nevertheless, the Fitzwilliams were courtiers who maintained generally good relationships with the royal family and benefitting from considerable enrichment during the dissolution of the monasteries, at its height between 1536 and 1538. They were therefore able to inject vast sums of money into the property and its mansion. Completed about 1540 the estate had a major impact on the local economy. Enormous amounts of food were required to feed the approximately 200 servants, huge numbers of family and visitors. About thirty separate dishes were served to anything up to 500 people at the main daily meal. Similarly, the building works themselves, using brick and stone rather than the locally produced materials of other local buildings at the time (typically timber framing infilled with wattle and daub), would have required vast amounts of transport, storage and accounting, bringing artists, craftspeople and specialists of many kinds to the town, driving the development of a local middle class. There are two wall paintings in the town said to have been painted by artists working on the mansion who were lodging in the houses concerned. One is in the building on North Street (currently occupied by the Olive and Vine Wine and Tappas bar), and the other is in Elizabeth House, beside the Swan Inn in Red Lion Street. They are thought to be either practice images for the work in the mansion, or painted in lieu of rent. The image in North Street tells the story of King Ahab robbing Nathan of his family vinyard, reflecting the despair that the mostly Catholic population of the town felt in being forbidden by the monarch to practice their religion. Part of North Street looking north The extension of the town along the former lane to Easebourne towards the new mansion, which had begun in the early 14th century with the building of the first mansion on the river-side site, now intensified. This contributed to the economic expansion, as merchants built new houses and shops on North Street to facilitate their dealings with Cowdray House. It was during this period that the Angel Hotel was built, as a coaching house in response to the growing travel. Fifty years later it hosted many of the Pilgrim Fathers, on their way from London and East Anglia to Plymouth. The local labour market was distorted as workers were diverted from their conventional tasks to work as servants or contribute to the building.Tudor Midhurst: A Midhurst Society Publication. 2nd Edition 2009 Town officials were concerned at the redirection of the Midhurst economy away from its traditional centre around the market place and towards the newly dynamic Cowdray House. The bailiff and burgesses petitioned Sir Anthony Fitzwilliam to give them a plot of land on which to build a market house near the church, as a focus for commerce in the Old Town. This was built in the market square in 1551, and although much altered since, it probably looked similar to the market house currently at the Weald and Downland Museum, with open bays on the ground floor, and an upstairs room for official use. In 1605 the owner of Cowdray House, Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu, was briefly arrested in connection with the Gunpowder Plot. He was suspected as a plotter because of his catholic religion and connections with several of the known plotters. Among others, he had briefly employed Guy Fawkes, a native of Lewes in East Sussex, as a footman. In addition he had stayed away from Parliament on 5 November following a warning from Robert Catesby, the leader of the plot. Anthony-Maria Browne spent about a year in the Tower of London, died in 1629 and is buried in Midhurst Church. Later in the 17th century this influence began to wane. By 1621 there were about forty households of recusants in Midhurst. In 1634 one John Arismandy appointed John Cope and Richard Shelley to administer certain moneys after his death to provide a priest for the poor Catholics of Midhurst, to say masses every week for his soul and 'my lords ancestors'. This deed was found in the 19th century in a box hidden in the chimney of an old house with rosaries and other religious objects. In the mid-1630s Sir Anthony Browne employed the fashionable cook, Robert May to be the chef at Cowdray House. In 1565 he published one of the earliest British cook-book ‚Äì The Accomplisht Cook.O'Flynn, Maurice. \\"England's First Celebrity Chef\\". champchefs.com.

In 1637, an ecclesiastical court case records parishioners of Midhurst playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February (Julian), one of the sport's earliest references.McCann T (2004) Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century, p.p. xxxviii‚Äìxxxix. Sussex Record Society. By the mid-17th century the Anglican church was well established and Catholicism apparently declining, although about a quarter of families remained catholic, and 30 years later there were a similar proportion of non-conformist families. In 1642, during the English Civil War, the 'Protestation' in support of the Anglican Church was signed by 207 men in Midhurst, but 54 'recusant Papists' refused at first to sign it. Two days later 35 of these did sign, probably excepting the special clause denouncing the Roman Faith, as did their colleagues at Easebourne, where there was an equal number of recusants. By 1676 the estimated numbers of Conformists (Anglicans) was recorded as being 341, of Roman Catholics 56, and of Non-conformists 50. In 1672 the wealthy local coverlet maker, Gilbert Hannan, founded a grammar school for twelve poor boys in the upper room of the Market House. This school is the antecedent of the current Midhurst Rother College.  Modern period  In 1831 there were only 41 eligible voters and Midhurst was considered a rotten borough. In the Great Reform Act of 1832 Midhurst was reduced to one Member of Parliament and the constituency was expanded to include most of the surrounding villages. Cowdray House and estate was owned by the Montagu family until 1843, when it was bought by the 6th Earl of Egmont, who sold it in 1910 to Sir Weetman Dickinson Pearson who in 1917 becomes Viscount Cowdray. The current owner is the 4th Viscount. There was a gasworks adjacent to the wharf just south of St. Ann's Hill. In 2002, Country Life magazine rated Midhurst the second best place to live in Britain, after Alnwick.  Geology  Midhurst is situated in the Wealden Greensand that lies between the South Downs and the Low Weald: that is, between the open rolling chalklands of the Downs, and the sandstones and clays of the western Weald, exemplified by the densely wooded slopes, hills and steep valleys around and especially to the north of Midhurst. The solid geology in the vicinity of Midhurst is sedimentary rock, as throughout Sussex. Descending northwards from the South Downs through Midhurst towards the Weald, the rocks become progressively older. The historic core of the town lies almost entirely on the Sandgate Formation (or beds), which form part of the Lower Greensand Group (Lower Cretaceous) while the southern suburbs are built on the sandstones of the Folkestone Formation. The drift geology of the Midhurst area comprises alluvium following the course of the River Rother and its tributaries, together with associated river terrace deposits of gravels, sands and silts.  Landmarks  South Pond South Pond is the second oldest structure in Midhurst, second only to St. Ann's Castle: it is thought to have been dammed in the early 12th century as a fish-pond for the Castle. To the west the South Mill was in existence by 1284, and used initially to grind corn. In 1634 it was converted to a fulling mill, and in the mid-1800s it was converted again to leather production. The pond is prone to silting due to its underlying greensand geology, and has in recent years become polluted and lifeless, in large part due to over-population of ducks as a result of artificial feeding. The South Pond Group was established in 2012 to conserve and develop the area around the South Pond as a wildlife corridor. Activities include clearance parties, water quality monitoring, newsletters, talks and maintaining notice and interpretation boards. Major renovation works, involving dredging and establishing reed and waterplant beds to reconstitute the natural ecology, capable of supporting a full range of pond life, were undertaken in 2014‚Äì 2015, under the leadership of the South Pond Group with community support. Midhurst War Memorial The Midhurst War Memorial is situated outside the Midhurst parish church at the confluence of Red Lion Street and Church Hill, adjacent to the Market Square. It occupies land donated to the town for this purpose by Major Harold Pearson. Mr. Percy Oliver (1885‚Äì1949), a local stonemason, was commissioned to build and carve the memorial in accordance with the design of Sir Ashton Webb, who also designed Admiralty Arch in London. The War Memorial was unveiled in 1923. It is aligned on the axis of the nave of the church and consists of a square pillar set upon a square plinth which stands on an octagonal base of two steps within a kerbed, cobbled area. It has been constructed from dressed sandstone, probably from a local quarry. The names of fifty men who fell during the First World War, together with their service or regiment, are inscribed on panels of limestone which have been fixed to the north and south faces of the pillar. In 1929 a proposal to install oak posts and chains was dropped due to cost. In April 1947 it was decided to add the names of the dead of World War II, and Mr Oliver was asked to fix a tablet to the War Memorial. However, it was not until 1960 that it was finally agreed to add these panels, and the work was completed in 1962. In 2014 the name of a soldier killed in the Afghan War was added to the plinth. The Memorial is in the care of the Town Trust. Each year on Remembrance Sunday, the Midhurst Branch of the Royal British Legion organises a service of remembrance at the War Memorial.  Listed buildings  There are 94 buildings in Midhurst listed with Historic England as having special architectural or historic interest, while the earthworks and ruins of St. Ann's Castle have been designated as a Scheduled Monument. The Parish Church of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Denis and the Spread Eagle Hotel are both listed Grade II*, while the remainder are Grade II. At least 42 of the listed buildings are in the Old Town. Of the listed buildings two recognisably predate 1500; six are 16th century; 30 are 17th century; 32 are 18th century; 22 are early 19th century; one is from 1841‚Äì1880; and one (a telephone box) is from 1914‚Äì45. As this is a K6 model, introduced in 1935, it must date from the latter decade of this period.  Transport   Rail  A royal train at the (LBSCR) station pre 1907 Midhurst was linked by three lines, one from Pulborough in 1866, one from Petersfield in 1864 and one from Chichester in 1881. The line from Chichester to Midhurst closed in 1935 to passengers and in 1951 to goods traffic. There were two stations, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway's (Chichester to Pulborough) and the London and South Western Railway's. All passenger services were concentrated on the LB&SCR; station in 1925 by the Southern Railway. The last passenger trains ran in 1955.The line remained open, from Pulborough only, for goods traffic until 1964.  Road  The A272 runs through the town east and west. The A286 runs through the town north and south. The town is served by four regular bus routes. Stagecoach operate numbers 60 to Chichester, 70 to Guildford via Haslemere and 1 to Worthing via Petworth; Emsworth operate 92 to Petersfield via Rogate.  Education  The secondary school in the town is Midhurst Rother College. It succeeds the former grammar school, founded in 1672. It is an Academy school formed following the closure of the grammar school and Midhurst Intermediate School in January 2009. In 2012/13 it was designated as \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1956. There is a state primary school in Midhurst, the Church of England Primary School, in Ashfield Road. Other state primary schools in the catchment area include those of Easebourne and Stedham. In Easebourne there is also a private primary school, Conifers.  Religious sites  The Midhurst Deanery is a Deanery of the Church of England comprising 22 churches in the Rother Valley between Midhurst and Petersfield. St Mary Magdalene's and St Denys' Church, Midhurst (NHLE Code 1234717) The Anglican Parish Church is St Mary Magdalene and St Denys, in the market square, which retains some old parts on the south side. The interior of the church has undergone much restoration and change and little evidence exists of its medieval heritage. Consisting of chancel and nave flanked by aisles on both sides, the church was largely rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1422, towards the end of Henry V's reign. The base of the tower is 13th century. The tower top, south nave and chancel arcades are 16th century in the perpendicular style. The rest of the building is from 1882 or later. Roman Catholic Parish Church is the Church of the Divine Motherhood and St Francis of Assisi, Bepton Road, was built in 1957, replacing an earlier church on Rumbolds hill, built in 1869 by C.A. Buckler in the early English style, now part of the Wheatsheaf pub. The new building is of sandstone in the shape of a segment of a circle with the rounded off point forming an eastern apse. The western arc is divided into seven sections by vertical stone fins, six of which are glazed, leaving the doorway in the central section with a Madonna and Child above. There is a circular skylight above the altar. The stations of the cross are carved on a continuous stone band along the side walls. There is a tall separate bell tower linked to the church by an open colonnade. Midhurst Methodist Church is a flint masonry building with brick quoins standing to the north of the old grammar school buildings. A large Gothic style west window looks towards the ruins of Cowdray House.  Sport  April 2015, Midhurst CC game against Headley 3 in the I Anson league The Midhurst Sports Association (MSA) owns the lease, runs and maintains the Sports Pavilion on the Midhurst Sports Ground, next to Cowdray Ruins. The MSA is also the umbrella group for the Midhurst Cricket, Rugby and Stoolball Clubs who currently hold individual leases for the playing fields. The Midhurst and Easebourne Football Club is a non-league football team, with a ground at Dodsley Road in the adjoining village of Easebourne. There is also a variety of youth football teams run by the club, and a walking football club for the over-50s and those with injuries.

It was originally released on March 27, 1989, in broadcast syndication. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Riker, Data, and Worf become trapped in a strange hotel on a planet otherwise incapable of supporting human life.  Plot  Following a tip from a Klingon ship, the Federation starship Enterprise, under the command of Captain Jean- Luc Picard, finds debris from an Earth ship orbiting an uninhabitable alien planet. A sample of the debris beamed aboard shows NASA markings and a 52-star American flag, meaning the debris of the ship is several hundred years old, and has traveled far beyond the capability of ships of that era. Scans of the planet reveal a small anomalous area capable of supporting human life, so Commander Riker, Lt. Worf, and Lt. Commander Data beam down to investigate, and find a revolving door in an otherwise blank environment. Upon entering they find themselves in an old Earth-style hotel and casino called The Royale, where they are cut off from contact with the Enterprise. The away team soon discovers they are trapped inside the casino, and after making several unsuccessful attempts to leave, they decide to explore the building. They find the desiccated but preserved remains of Col. Steven Richey, a NASA astronaut, and a pulp novel entitled Hotel Royale. Upon reading Richey's logs, they learn that his starship was accidentally contaminated by an unknown race of aliens, then thrown across the galaxy, and he was the only survivor. Taking pity on him, the aliens created The Royale for him, thinking the novel's story represented humans' preferred way of living, whereas Richey found it unbearable thanks to the poor quality of the novel. Riker, Data, and Worf realize that the plot has been recreated in detail by the aliens and is playing out in front of them, and surmise that they might be able to leave if they are scripted to do so. They assume the role of a trio of \\"foreign investors\\" described in the novel and, taking advantage of Data's ability to precisely manipulate dice at the casino's craps table, win enough money to buy out the Royale, and are then able to leave.  Production  The episode was written by Tracy Torm√© under the pseudonym of Keith Mills. Torm√© had his name removed from the credits after he became unsatisfied with rewrites. His original idea was a surreal nightmare about an astronaut stuck forever in his most pleasant memory.  Historical/scientific accuracy  * The episode mentions Fermat's Last Theorem, and that it still had not been solved after 800 years. A proof was, however, found by Andrew Wiles and published in 1995, six years after the episode aired. The resulting incongruity in \\"The Royale\\" was later addressed in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Facets\\". * In the scene where Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge scans the planet, he describes the surface temperature as ‚àí291 ¬∞C, a temperature that is below absolute zero (‚àí273.15 ¬∞C).

As a result of a number of stories that arose after a duel, and then because of his financial difficulties, he became known after his death as \\"the Wicked Lord\\" and \\"the Devil Byron\\". Early life Byron was the son of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and his wife Hon. Frances Berkeley, a descendant of John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. He inherited his title upon the death of his father on 18 August 1736. He clearly had some military aspirations, enlisting into the Royal Navy as a midshipman aged 14 and serving aboard HMS Victory as a lieutenant at 18. At 17 he was also listed as a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital, a popular charity project to look after abandoned babies that had previously been championed by his mother. After an abortive stint as a captain in the Duke of Kingston's Regiment during the Jacobite Rebellion, he went on to marry Elizabeth Shaw, daughter and heiress of Charles Shaw of Besthorpe in Norfolk, on 28 March 1747 ‚Äì they went on to have four children, two of whom lived to adulthood. The month after his marriage he was elected Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, a position he held until 20 March 1752. He also served as Master of the Staghounds from 1763 until 1765, though he achieved nothing of note in either role. Byron was initiated to the Scottish Rite Masonry and become Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns) form 1747 to 1751. Duel On 26 January 1765, Byron killed his distant cousin and neighbour, William Chaworth, in a dispute at the Star and Garter tavern (on the site of the Carlton Club), Pall Mall, in London. The fight resulted from an argument the two had been engaged in over cups of wine, with both insisting they had more game on their estates. Lord Byron and his cousin retired to a dim room to resolve their disagreement and it was there that Lord Byron thrust his sword through Chaworth's stomach. Chaworth lived until the following day, expressing his disgust that he had not been of sound enough mind to insist they fight in a location outfitted with better lighting before finally succumbing to his injury. Lord Byron was tried for Chaworth's death, but was found guilty only of manslaughter. He claimed the benefit of the statute of Edward VI and so instead of being \\"burned in the hand\\" was forced to pay a small fine.Beckett p.37Ferrall, p. 24 Gossip and myths Lord Byron already had a poor reputation at the time of Chaworth's death ‚Äì but as he awaited his trial at the Tower of London, Horace Walpole described how countless malicious stories about him were 'revived or invented'. Some contained a kernel of truth, but others were entirely fabricated. They included the accusations that he had murdered a coachman and paid off his family, and that he had murdered his own wife. Many more myths about him were first set in print in the 19th century, decades after his death. These first appear in the 1820s and 1830s, some of which appear to have been invented by the American writer Washington Irving, include: \\\\- That he became a recluse at Newstead Abbey after the duel of 1765; \\\\- That he intentionally laid waste to his estates and the Byron family fortune in revenge for his son's disobedience; \\\\- That he mounted the sword he used to kill Chaworth on the wall in his bedroom at Newstead Abbey; \\\\- That he spent his youth organising orgies at Newstead Abbey; and spent his later years worshipping Satan; \\\\- That in his eccentric, perhaps insane, old age, he cultivated a swarm of crickets, which he trained to race all over his body and which abandoned his home at the moment of his death. The stories have been propagated particularly by biographers of Byron's great nephew, the poet. After the duel Far from becoming a recluse, immediately after the duel Byron planned a holiday to the Belgian town of Spa with his wife and sister, Isabella, Lady Carlisle. The latter noted that the couple were unable to control their spending, calling them 'ye worst managers I ever saw'. In some time in the late 1760s, Byron schemed to resolve his serious financial difficulties through a judicious marriage of William, his son and heir, into a wealthy family. But just before the marriage William eloped with his cousin Juliana Byron, the daughter of Byron's younger brother, the naval captain and later Vice-Admiral John Byron. Lord Byron's main concern was that he needed his son to marry well in order to escape the debt.Beckett p.66 Despite the myth that Lord Byron became enraged by his son's elopement and subsequently tried to wreak revenge by ruining his inheritance ‚Äì tearing down trees, selling off artworks and killing over 2000 deer ‚Äì the fall of the estate came about in fact because without the cash injection required by an affluent heiress daughter-in-law, Lord Byron simply couldn't pay his debts. The real neglect of Newstead did not occur until after the death of Byron's son William in 1776 ‚Äì this left Byron legally unable to sell off parts of his lands and estate without the permission of an adult heir (his grandson was not due to turn 21 until 1793).Beckett p. 61 In around 1778, he was forced to sell off the majority of his effects at Newstead Abbey, in what became known as the 'Great Sale' ‚Äì this included artistic masterpieces, hunting gear, furniture and even toothpicks. His wife Elizabeth left him shortly afterwards, taking their only surviving child Caroline with her. Caroline died in 1784, leaving the couple childless. Later accounts attest that he subsequently took one of the servants, Elizabeth Hardstaff, as his mistress and that she became known as \\"Lady Betty\\". Though there is no solid evidence for a relationship, she was one of the few people mentioned in his will. Deaths and legacy Byron also outlived his grandson, a young man who, at the age of twenty-two, was killed by cannon fire in 1794 while fighting in Corsica. Expectation of the barony then fell to his great nephew, George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, who became the 6th Baron Byron when Lord Byron died on 21 May 1798, at the age of seventy-five. Lord Byron is buried in the Byron vault at Hucknall Torkard in Nottinghamshire. Arms Bibliography * Emily Brand, The Fall of the House of Byron (John Murray, 2020) *J. V.

Andagoya is named for Pascual de Andagoya (1495‚Äì1548), a Spanish conquistador. History A cacique named Pocorosa lived in Andagoya in the 19th century. Pocorosa met the Spanish conquistadors. Climate Andagoya has one of the most monotonous climates in the world. Its annual range of mean monthly temperatures ‚Äì that is to say, the difference between the warmest and coldest months ‚Äì at Andagoya is mere 0.8 ¬∞C (1.44 ¬∞F) as March, the warmest month, has an average temperature of 26.8 ¬∞C (80.24 ¬∞F) while November, the \\"coldest\\" month, averages 26.0 ¬∞C (78.8 ¬∞F); the average annual temperature is 26.5 ¬∞C (79.7 ¬∞F). This near complete uniformity of temperature is caused by the fact that Andagoya, at a latitude of 5¬∞5' North, lies extremely close to the thermal equator, which is situated a few degrees north of the astronomical equator because the Earth reaches perihelion (its closest position to the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (furthest away) in early July, causing places located precisely at the equator to receive somewhat more insolation (i.e., light and heat energy from the sun) in January than in July even though the height of the sun and the length of days would be the same at both times. At a few degrees north latitude, however, the perihelion/aphelion factor and the slightly higher sun and longer days experienced at the time of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere cancel each other out, making the level of insolation experienced there virtually identical throughout the year. Every month of the year has at least 549 millimeters (21.61 inches) of average precipitation, with the wettest month (May) averaging 726.6 millimeters (28.60 inches). Average annual precipitation is 7,089 millimeters (291.56 inches), and more rain falls at night than during the day, the reverse of what is true in most places that have tropical rainforest climate.

MacKenzie is known for establishing and commanding Sector Sarajevo as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia in 1992. He was later a vocal opponent of NATO's involvement in the Kosovo War. Biography MacKenzie was born in Truro, Nova Scotia, the son of Eugene and Shirley MacKenzie (nee Wharton.) He was raised in nearby Princeport. He is named after his great uncle, Liverpool, Nova Scotia schooner captain Lewis Wharton. MacKenzie's forefather Israel Wharton fought as a United Empire Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War, taking part in the Battle of Waxhaws, before he subsequently settled in the Liverpool area. Military career MacKenzie enlisted with The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and was commissioned in 1960. During his Canadian army career, MacKenzie served nine years in West Germany with NATO forces and had nine peacekeeping tours of duty with the United Nations in six different mission areas ‚Äì the Gaza Strip (1963 and 1964), Cyprus (1965,1971 and 1978), Vietnam, Egypt, Central America (1990‚Äì91, commanding the United Nations Observer Mission) and the former Yugoslavia (1992‚Äì1993). Between peacekeeping missions MacKenzie served as an instructor at the Canadian Forces Command and Staff College (1979‚Äì82) and as director of army training at St. Hubert, Que. (1983‚Äì85). As commander of the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, N.B. (1988‚Äì90) he was responsible for training officers at the Combat Training Centre. In 1985, he was appointed director of Combat-Related Employment for Women and, in 1991, he was appointed deputy commander of the Canadian Army's Land Force Central Area. Following his return from the Balkans in October 1992, MacKenzie was appointed commander of the army in Ontario. He retired from the Canadian Forces in 1993, after a 35-year career. He was the first Canadian, military or civilian, to be awarded a second Meritorious Service Cross. The second was Brigadier-General Guy Laroche in October 2010. Somalia Affair Lewis MacKenzie was criticised by the Somalia Commission of Inquiry for his contribution to the Somalia Affair after Canadian Forces in Somalia committed human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law and members of the Canadian command were found to have engaged in a subsequent cover- up.http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57JQTG?OpenDocument&View;=defaultBody&style;=custo_print The Commission observed that MacKenzie testified in an honest and straightforward manner; it did not always accept everything that he said but accepted that he offered the truth as he saw it. It found that his superiors' desire to parade his successes as a bona fide hero of the Canadian Forces had impaired his ability to supervise and control matters that were his core responsibilities. The Commission found that MacKenzie had failed adequately to investigate the significant leadership and discipline problems in the Canadian Airborne Regiment, to inform himself of the problems and to take decisive remedial steps to ensure they were adequately resolved. In addition, it found that he did not adequately monitor the Regiment's training to ensure its development as a cohesive unit or make adequate provisions for the troops to be trained or tested on its newly developed Rules of Engagement and failed to direct and supervise the training of the Canadian Joint Force Somalia personnel in the Law of Armed Conflict for peace support operations. The Commission further ruled that MacKenzie had important obligations as a commander and so bore responsibility for the failures that attached to the discharge of those obligations. His role was pivotal and despite the fact that he was necessarily absent from his post due to obligations condoned by his superiors, errors in the chain of command below him remained his responsibility and flowed upwards from him to the highest levels of the command structure. Bosnian War Honorary portrait of Lewis MacKenzie in the Canadian War Museum. In February 1992, MacKenzie was named chief of staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in former Yugoslavia, tasked with supervising the cease-fire in Croatia. The force headquarters were located in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In April 1992 the Bosnian war broke out. MacKenzie created and assumed command of the peacekeeping force's Sector Sarajevo in May 1992. He used his UN force to open Sarajevo Airport for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Using the media as a means of trying to help restore peace, MacKenzie became an international celebrity. MacKenzie returned from the Balkans in October 1992 in controversial circumstances. As a member of the Canadian armed forces he was precluded from commenting on government policy. After criticising the United Nations' inability to command, control, and support its peacekeeping forces, he retired from the military in March 1993. He has since written and lectured on his experiences in the former Yugoslavia questioning the numbers killed in the Srebrenica massacre, an event that came after his period of service in the area. He has challenged the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and, in 2005, contested the conclusions and reasoning of the Appeal Chamber's 2004 judgment in the Krstiƒá case that the crime of genocide was perpetrated at Srebrenica in July 1995: : \\"What happened next is only debatable in scale. The Bosnian Muslim men and older boys were singled out and the elderly, women and children were moved out ‚Ä¶ if you're committing genocide, you don't let the women go since they are key to perpetuating the very group you are trying to eliminate. Many of the men and boys were executed and buried in mass graves.\\"The real story behind Srebrenica\\", The Globe and Mail, July 14, 2005 :... : \\"Evidence given at The Hague war crimes tribunal casts serious doubt on the figure of \\"up to\\" 8,000 Bosnian Muslims massacred. That figure includes \\"up to\\" 5,000 who have been classified as missing. More than 2,000 bodies have been recovered in and around Srebrenica, and they include victims of the three years of intense fighting in the area. The math just doesn't support the scale of 8,000 killed\\". He has also disputed that Srebrenica ever was a UN Safe area, and argued that the demilitarization requirements imposed on both the Serb side (surrounding Srebrenica) and the Bosniak side (inside the enclave) were never fulfilled: : \\"It didn't take long for the Bosnian Muslims to realize that the UN was in no position to live up to its promise to \\"protect\\" Srebrenica. With some help from outsiders, they began to infiltrate thousands of fighters and weapons into the safe haven. As the Bosnian Muslim fighters became better equipped and trained, they started to venture outside Srebrenica, burning Serb villages and killing their occupants before quickly withdrawing to the security provided by the UN's safe haven. These attacks reached a crescendo in 1994 and carried on into early 1995 after the Canadian infantry company that had been there for a year was replaced by a larger Dutch contingent\\". The 2000 book The Lion, the Fox, and the Eagle by Carol Off, which devotes a third of its content to MacKenzie's role in Yugoslavia, claims that MacKenzie was willfully ignorant of the Bosnian political situation and was manipulated into being a vehicle of pro- Serb propaganda. In 1993, investigative reporter and Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Roy Gutman accused Mackenzie of having two trips to Washington D.C., one to speak in front of the Heritage Foundation and the other to appear as an expert witness for the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, funded by SERBNET, a Serbian-American lobbyist group. In a telephone interview with Gutman, MacKenzie responded, \\"It wouldn't surprise me if there was some Serbian involvement considering who initiated the contract; however I would be very disappointed if that were the case.\\" The day after the interview, an article appeared in Newsday suggesting that MacKenzie was on the Serbian payroll. When MacKenzie confirmed the source of the funds was indeed SERBNET, he donated the entire fee to the Canadian Federation of Aids Research (CANFAR). However, UN officials ultimately criticised his \\"lack of judgment\\" in the matter. Post-Military Media MacKenzie is the author of two books: * Peacekeeper: Road to Sarajevo * Soldiers Made Me Look Good: A Life in the Shadow of War and also writes short essays about military affairs, most often in The Globe and Mail: * \\"We can help in Mali without putting ‚Äòboots on the ground‚Äô\\" 23 Jan 2013 * \\"The road to Damascus goes through Moscow\\" 22 Feb 2012 * \\"NATO's Libya 'hope' strategy is bombing\\" 10 Jun 2011 He is frequently sought by Canadian broadcast media as a security and military affairs commentator: * \\"Cracks showing in NATO's Libya strategy\\" 22 Jun 2011 * \\"As politicians hit hustings, Canada's Libya mission flies under the radar\\" 24 Mar 2011 * \\"Tories let election skirmishes eclipse war in Libya\\" 29 Mar 2011 * \\"Daniel M√©nard scandal leaves military reeling\\" 30 May 2010 In 2005, following the appointment of former Lieutenant-General Rom√©o Dallaire as a Liberal senator, MacKenzie wrote an editorial in The Globe and Mail entitled \\"Rom√©o, Rom√©o, wherefore art thou partisan?\\" arguing that Dallaire had compromised his previous stance by endorsing the Liberal Party's position on intervention in Sudan.Rom√©o, Rom√©o, wherefore art thou partisan?, The Globe and Mail, 19 May 2005. On 19 April 2010, MacKenzie was interviewed on CTV's Power Play in relation to accusations by Ahmadshah Malgarai, a translator, who witnessed interrogations in which a witness allegedly recounted that the Canadian military murdered a 17-year-old Afghan. MacKenzie dismissed those accusations as \\"crap\\" and \\"insulting\\" to the Canadian military, while he viewed the denial by the Canadian military as credible. Amir Attaran, a law professor and lawyer for Malgarai disagreed with Mackenzie, arguing that instead of comparing credibility, the military must release the records of detainee interrogations to Parliament, so that Parliament may determine what occurred, based upon the available facts. According to Attaran, it is a legal requirement that the documents regarding detainee interrogations be produced, while they need not be made public. MacKenzie called it \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"ludicrous\\" to table such documents in Parliament and that, furthermore, he was \\"not concerned\\" about the legal requirement to do so. Near the end of the interview, MacKenzie verbally attacked Dr. Attaran: \\"Last time I checked, in various polls being done across Canada, the Canadian Forces are at the very top of trustworthiness with the Canadian population. I won't mention where lawyers were slated.\\" MacKenzie is interviewed in two documentary films by Serbian-Canadian film- maker Boris Malagurski: Kosovo: Can You Imagine? (2009) and The Weight of Chains (2011). He also contributed to the Canadian documentary If I Should Fall, which focuses on the Canadian military experience in Afghanistan since 9/11. Politics In the 1997 federal election, MacKenzie was Progressive Conservative candidate for Parliament for the central Ontario riding of Parry Sound‚ÄîMuskoka. Tory leader Jean Charest suggested that if their party won power, MacKenzie would become Deputy Prime Minister. The Tories improved their standing and regained official party status, though MacKenzie finished second to Liberal incumbent Andy Mitchell.

It was created and drawn by Nick Brennan and made its debut in issue 2865, dated 14 June 1997. It was part of an ongoing selection of six comic strips that were to be voted into the comic by readers. This strip (along with Tim Traveller) was the winner, beating Camp Cosmos, Have a Go Jo, Sydd and Trash Can Ally. Concept The strip starred Ernest Valentine, a stupid boy who is hopelessly in love with Daisy. Daisy, however, has no feelings at all for Ernest, but Ernest always fails to get the message. He follows her around and even pops out of cakes to see her. Usually, by the end of the strip, Daisy ends up going out with another man who is in some way connected with the strip, e.g. a fireman that gets called out. Daisy has only one set of clothes, and, not counting the earliest strips, never wears anything else. In one strip she opens her wardrobe and she has many sets of identical clothes and then shops for more. Ernest Valentine By the time the 2000s came, the strip was still going strong, but with a slight twist to the usual ending of the strip; rather than Ernest being jilted by Daisy for another man, Ernest usually ended up being beaten up, falling from a great height, or otherwise suffering some painful misfortune, which usually put him in traction. While probably not totally intentional, this was part of the Beano's recent move towards using more slapstick. For a while Joe King's Joke Corner was at the bottom of this strip, but was moved later on. Although no longer in the weekly Beano, Fun- Size Beano still reprints the stories from previous Fun-Sizes. It is now the most recent strip ever featured in Classics from the Comics, with a 2003 story appearing in the August 2008 issue, Number 148.

Formerly, old \\"buck sergeant\\" insignia. Senior Airman (SrA) is the fourth enlisted rank in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, just above Airman First Class and below Staff Sergeant. It has a pay grade of E-4. Between its approval on 30 December 1975 (with implementation 1 June 1976) and 19 March 1991, Senior Airmen wore sleeve chevrons with blue center stars instead of silver to distinguish them from the non-commissioned officer rank of \\"Sergeant\\", also a pay grade of E-4. The latter was abolished in 1991 and the blue center star was changed to white to conform to all enlisted rank chevrons. The Air Force promotes an Airman First Class (A1C) to Senior Airman after 36 months time in service (TIS) and 20 months time in grade (TIG), or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first. Outstanding Airmen First Class, limited to no more than 15 percent of the total, may be promoted to Senior Airmen six months early, in a competitive process called Below-the-Zone. Senior Airmen are expected to be technically proficient and begin to develop leadership skills, and may be expected to supervise an Airman of lesser rank. Senior Airmen must attend the six-week Airman Leadership School, the first course of the Air Force's college of enlisted professional military education, before being promoted to staff sergeant. SrA with no projected promotion and between three and six years TIS, may attend Airman Leadership School. History Old USAF Senior Airman rank insignia 1975-1991 Senior Airman controlling satellites Formerly, from 1976 to 1991, this grade was divided into ranks with separate titles: sergeant (referred to unofficially but almost universally within the USAF as \\"Buck Sergeant\\" or simply \\"Buck\\"), a non-commissioned officer; and Senior Airman, which is the equivalent of Specialist, a non-supervisory rank. Senior Airmen were promoted to Sergeant after 12 months' time in grade and completion of the now-defunct Non-Commissioned Officer Preparatory Course. This schism reflected a desire by the Air Force in 1976 to subdivide enlisted ranks into a three- tier organization, a move which was resisted by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, resulting in the compromise dual-rank that lasted fifteen years. The last Air Force promotions to Sergeant were effective 1 April 1991. Those personnel who had been promoted to Sergeant prior to this cut off date retained the rank until being promoted to a higher rank or leaving the service. There are no longer any personnel on active duty who hold this rank. Due to high year of tenure rules in effect at the time, the last person to hold the rank was forced out of the Air Force on 23 March 1998.Last Airforce Buck Sergeant Sergeants wore the same chevrons as present-day senior airmen. Senior airmen wore similar chevrons, but with a blue (green on the fatigue or battle dress uniform) subdued central star, as did all airmen in the lowest tier. The ranks of Senior Airman and Sergeant held the same pay grade, but Sergeants were expected to supervise other airmen as part of their duties as non-commissioned officers. As with any change in policy, many Airmen supported this change, while others protested. Those Air Force members against the change protested that the rank of Sergeant prepared Airmen for transition to Staff Sergeant, and that new Staff Sergeants would therefore be less well- trained for their new position. In addition, Senior Airmen who complete Airman Leadership School may be expected to supervise lower-ranking Airmen but are not considered non-commissioned officers and therefore have limited authority. Air Force personnel who supported the change argued that proper leadership training eliminated the need for a separate rank within the pay grade; moreover, the rank created disparity between individuals earning the same pay and benefits and, often, performing the same duties, since often there were no additional junior airmen in a given duty section for a new buck sergeant to supervise. Senior Airmen are the lowest USAF rank eligible for selection as a USAF recruiter, and (before Fall of 2013) as a military training instructor for USAF basic military training. Today, the USAF is again the only United States military service that does not have a non-commissioned officer rank at the E-4 pay grade. Previously, from 1947 to 1952, and from late 1968 or early 1969 to 1997, the rank of Sergeant (E-4) was a non-commissioned officer rank in the USAF. In the interim, from 1952 to at least early 1968, the paygrade rank was titled Airman First Class.

He ruled the emirate for 32 years from 1958 until his death in 1990. Development of Dubai Sheikh Rashid was responsible for the transformation of Dubai from a small cluster of settlements near the Dubai Creek to a modern port city and commercial hub. A quote commonly attributed to Sheikh RashidWhile the following quote is commonly attributed to Sheikh Rashid, it is sometimes attributed to Saudi politician Ahmed Zaki Yamani. Furthermore, the quote has some alternate forms, such as \\"My grandfather rode a camel. My father drove a car. I fly in jet planes. My son will drive a car. My grandson will ride a camel\\"., \\"My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel\\", reflected his concern that Dubai's oil, which was discovered in 1966 and which began production in 1969, would run out within a few generations. He therefore worked to develop the economy of Dubai so that it could survive after the end of oil production, and was a driving force behind a number of major infrastructure projects to promote Dubai as a regional hub for trade: #Port Rashid (opened in 1972) #Al Shindagha Tunnel (opened in 1975) #Jebel Ali Port (opened in 1979) #Dubai World Trade Centre (built in 1978) #The second major dredging and widening of the Dubai Creek (early 1970s)Ruling Shaikhs and Her Majesty's Government, 1960-1969. Joyce, Miriam. Routledge. 2003 #Dubai Drydocks (opened in 1983) Relationship with other emirates  Dubai remained in a stand-off with Abu Dhabi at the time Sheikh Rashid became Ruler of Dubai following the armed border dispute between the two emirates in 1946, and he established a close relationship with Qatar. Sheikh Rashid's daughter married the Emir of Qatar in 1961. In 1966, India devalued the rupee, and Qatar and Dubai adopted the Gulf rupee as a common currency, whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the Bahraini dinar. The Emir of Kuwait assisted in the financing of the Dredging of the Creek, along with a popular issue of bonds, the 'creek bonds' and revenue derived from land reclamation made possible by the dredging. The project resulted in Dubai's rising prominence as an entrep√¥t, a position cemented by the visionary construction of a 15-berth deep water port, Port Rashid, starting in 1969. Sheikh Rashid brought Dubai to join Abu Dhabi and other northern Emirates to create the United Arab Emirates in 1971, and in 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency, the UAE dirham. Jebel Ali port was established in 1979, and the customs free zone Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ) was built around the port in 1985. By the late 1990s JAFZ developed into a commercial free zone. Family Sheikh Rashid's father was Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum while his mother was Sheikha Hessa bint Al Mur bin Hureiz Al Falasi. Left to right: Sheikh Rashid, Adi Bitar, and Sheikh Rashid's sons Mohammed and Maktoum, both future rulers of Dubai, in 1968 Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum married once to Sheikha Latifa bint Hamdan Al Nahyan, the daughter of Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Surry Hills is immediately south-east of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Surry Hills is surrounded by the suburbs of Darlinghurst to the north, Chippendale and Haymarket to the west, Moore Park and Paddington to the east and Redfern to the south.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2002, Map 19 It is bordered by Elizabeth Street and Chalmers Street to the west, Cleveland Street to the south, South Dowling Street to the east, and Oxford Street to the north. Central is a locality in the north-west of the suburb around Central station. Prince Alfred Park is located nearby. Strawberry Hills is a locality around Cleveland and Elizabeth Streets and Brickfield Hill to the east of that. A multicultural suburb, Surry Hills has had a long association with the Portuguese community of Sydney.  History  The first land grants in Surry Hills were made in the 1790s. Major Joseph Foveaux received . His property was known as Surry Hills Farm, after the Surrey Hills in Surrey, England. Foveaux Street is named in his honour.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.249 Commissary John Palmer received . He called the property George Farm and in 1800 Palmer also bought Foveaux's farm. In 1792, the boundaries of the Sydney Cove settlement were established between the head of Cockle Bay to the head of Woolloomooloo Bay. West of the boundary, which included present-day Surry Hills, was considered suitable for farming and was granted to military officers and free settlers. After Palmer's political failures, his reduced financial circumstances forced the first subdivision and sale of his estate in 1814. Isaac Nichols bought Allotment 20, comprising over . Due to the hilly terrain, much of the suburb was considered remote and 'inhospitable'. In the early years of the nineteenth century the area around what is now Prince Alfred Park was undeveloped land known as the Government Paddocks or Cleveland Paddocks. A few villas were built in the suburb in the late 1820s. The suburb remained one of contrasts for much of the nineteenth century, with the homes of wealthy merchants mixed with that of the commercial and working classes. A Surry Hills street, 1940s In 1820, Governor Macquarie ordered the consecration of the Devonshire Street Cemetery. A brick wall was erected before any interments took place to enclose its . Within a four-year period the cemetery was expanded by the addition of to its south. A road was formed along the southern boundary of the cemetery in the first half of the 1830s and was called Devonshire Street. The Devonshire Street Cemetery, where many of the early settlers were buried, was later moved to build the Sydney railway terminus. Central railway station was opened on 4 August 1906. The area around Cleveland and Elizabeth streets was known as Strawberry Hills. Strawberry Hills post office was located at this intersection for many years.Book of Sydney Suburbs, p.249 In 1833, the Nichols estate was subdivided and sold. One purchase was by Thomas Broughton and subsequently acquired by George Hill who constructed Durham Hall on this and adjoining lots. Terrace houses and workers' cottages were built in Surry Hills from the 1850s. Light industry became established in the area, particularly in the rag trade (clothing industry). It became a working class suburb, predominately inhabited by Irish immigrants. The suburb developed a reputation for crime and vice.

In 1896 Patineur Grotesque one of Australia's first films and first comedy routine filmed was shot in Prince Alfred Park by Marius Sestier. Surry Hills was favoured by newly arrived families after World War II when property values were low and accommodation was inexpensive. From the 1980s, the area was gentrified, with many of the area's older houses and building restored and many new upper middle-class residents enjoying the benefits of inner-city living.

Senior master sergeants typically assume superintendent duties, overseeing enlisted members' efforts to accomplish a major segment of a unit's mission, in preparation for promotion to the rank of chief master sergeant. They are expected to serve as mentors for noncommissioned and junior commissioned officers. Senior master sergeants in the first sergeant special duty serve as first sergeants of larger units than those employing master sergeants as first sergeants. These first sergeants (pay grades E-7 to E-9) are referred to officially as \\"First Sergeant\\" (regardless of their pay grade), and unofficially as \\"First Shirt\\" or simply \\"Shirt\\". Public Law 107-107, the \\"National Defense Authorization Act\\", establishes senior enlisted strength levels for all branches of the US military. Currently, only 2.5 percent of the Air Force's total active duty enlisted strength may hold this rank. Senior master sergeants are sometimes referred to by the nickname of \\"Senior.\\" In the past, this was a casual nickname that was inappropriate in formal situations. However, on July 12, 2018, new Air Force regulations were issued that made \\"Senior\\" one of the official terms of address for senior master sergeants, in addition to the pre- existing \\"Senior Master Sergeant\\" and \\"Sergeant\\" addresses. Historical note Senior master sergeant insignia (obsolete) Although the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of senior master sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958. This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 but without title. It was not until late 1958 that the title of senior master sergeant (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon after the enlisted force was polled. At that time, the senior master sergeant rank had only a single chevron above and six below, and a chief two above and six below. In 1994 the Air Force changed its NCO insignia so that a maximum of five stripes were placed on the bottom of the chevrons, adding one above to each of the top three grades, resulting in the present form.

Sumy, regional center (–°–£–ú–ò, –û–ë–õ–ê–°–ù–ò–ô –¶–ï–ù–¢–†). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. The date of its foundation is a subject of discussion (in 1652 or 1655). In 1656‚Äì58 at the site of Sumyn early settlement under leadership of Muscovite voivode K. Arsenyev, there was built a city-fort that consisted of a fort and a grad (town). In the 1670s it was expanded by adding a fortified posad (craftsmen town), after which Sumy became the biggest fortress of Sloboda Ukraine. Since 1658 Sumy was a center of the Sumy Cossack Regiment (military unit and local administrative division). In the 1680s around Sumy started to form unfortified suburbs. At the end of 17th century, Sumy played a role of collection point of Muscovite troops during the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689. During the Great Northern War, from December 1708 to January 1709 the city was the Stavka (headquarters) of Muscovite Chief of Commander headed by Tsar Peter the Great. Established under the leadership of Prince A.Shakhovskoy, in 1734‚Äì43 in Sumy was located the Commission on streamlining the Sloboda Cossack regiments. From its establishment and until the liquidation of Cossackdom in Sloboda Ukraine in 1765, the Cossack officer family of Kondratyevs had a great influence over the city. Following the liquidation of Cossack community in 1765, Sumy Cossack Regiment as an administrative division was turned into Sumy Province of the newly created Sloboda Ukraine Governorate and the city of Sumy became its center. In 1780 Sumy was turned into a centre of Sumy uyezd. In 1786-89 the city was reformed by removing its city fort vallums. After a period of stagnation (1765‚Äì1860s), Sumy began to transform into a big industrial and trade center with the Paul's Sugar-Refining Factory (est. 1869 by I.Kharytonenko) and the Sumy Engineering Workshops (est. 1896, producing equipment for sugar refineries). With the construction of a railroad Vorozhba ‚Äì Merefa, in January 1877 in the city was built the Sumy train station. A great contribution in development of Sumy made various families of philanthropists industrialists, the most famous of which are Kharytonenkos. During the Revolution of 1905, Sumy was one of several areas which became famous throughout Russia for in effect having established an independent peasant republic; the Sumy Republic was established by a peasant union.Figes, Orlando: A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891‚Äì1924. The Bodley Head, London (2014). p. 183 During the German occupation of Ukraine during World War II (1941‚Äì1944), Sumy sustained heavy damage and was occupied from October 10, 1941 to September 2, 1943. After the war, the destroyed parts of the city were rebuilt. Sumy has been a twin town of Celle, Germany since January 17, 1990.  Geography  Sumy is located in the northeastern part of Ukraine within the Central Russian Upland and in the historical region of Sloboda Ukraine. It is located on the banks of Psel River.

Arts and culture Landmarks Trinity Cathedral *The city centre is dominated by the large cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration. It is a neoclassical structure of the 18th century, extensively repaired and reconstructed in 1858 and in the 1880s, when the 56-metre-high bell tower (180 ft) was added. The interior features frescoes by Vladimir Makovsky and Klavdiy Lebedev. *The Resurrection Church (1702), the oldest structure in the town, is still in fair preservation, owing to recent restoration work. *The cathedral of the monastery of St. Pantaleon was erected in 1911 to a design by Aleksey Shchusev and is scored to resemble medieval monuments of Novgorod and Pskov. *A lovely church of Saints Peter and Paul is in the town's cemetery. It was built in 1851 on the donations of Sumy citizens. Beside the church there are tombs of the Kharytonenkos and Sukhanovs with artistic monuments by sculptors ‚Äì A. Croisy and M. Antokolski. *The Cathedral of Holy Trinity was built in 1902‚Äì1914 on the same pattern as the Cathedral of St. Isaac in St. Petersburg. The author of the design was Sumy architect G. Sholts. It was built at the expense of Pavlo Kharitonenko, the local manufacturer and Maecenas who fulfilled his father's last will. Icon-painting is by famous artist M. Nesterov. The work on the decorative design was not completed because of the revolutionary events of 1917.  Museums  Local Museum The Sumy Regional Art Museum was opened in 1920. It was started from nationalized private collections of the town and district. Paintings of Taras Shevchenko, Vladimir Borovikovsky, I. Shyskin, Arkhip Kuindzhi and Tetyana Yablonska are on display, including a Dutch landscape by a painter of Jan van Goyen's circle. Today the museum contains unique paintings and works of applied art. The building of the early 20th century originally belonged to the State Bank. The Museum of Local Lore was opened in 1920. In the years of fascist occupation, the most important items of its collections were lost. Today it contains unique collections covering archeology and natural history of the Sumy region. It is located in the building of the 19th century which originally was the seat of the district government. In 1905 it was given to the printing house and publishing house of the first Sumy newspapers. In different years the building was visited by A. Kuprin and V. Korolenko, the famous Russian writers. The Chekhov Museum, located in Chekhov street is an architectural complex representing Lintvarev's country estate of the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1888 and 1889 a great writer and dramatist Anton Chekhov was dreaming to settle in Luka forever but his dream did not come true. ‚ÄúAbbacia and the Adriatic Sea are wonderful, but Luka and Psiol are better‚Äù ‚Äì he wrote in his letter from Italy to his friends in Sumy in 1894. This is also a place where Anton Chekhov's brother, Nikolai Chekhov, died in 1889. The Museum of Banking history in the Sumy oblast and the History of Ukrainian Money was founded in 2006 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Ukrainian Academy of Banking on the basis of a unique collection of Ukrainian bonds ‚Äì the paper money out of circulation, which were given to the academy by the National Bank of Ukraine.

The official term is \\"Chief Master Sergeant\\" or \\"Chief\\". Attaining the rank of Chief Master Sergeant is the pinnacle of an Air Force enlisted person's career. Some Chief Master Sergeants manage the efforts of all enlisted personnel within their unit or major subsection while others run major staff functions at higher headquarters levels. All Chief Master Sergeants are expected to serve as mentors for non- commissioned officers and junior enlisted members, and to serve as advisers to unit commanders and senior officers. By federal law, roughly one percent of the Air Force enlisted force may hold the rank of chief master sergeant.  Special duty positions  E-9 first sergeant Insignia of a chief master sergeant serving as first sergeant  First sergeant  The E-9 pay grade of first sergeant, is special duty rank held by a senior enlisted member of a military unit who reports directly to the unit commander or deputy commander of operations. This positional billet held by a chief master sergeant, and is denoted on the rank insignia by a lozenge (known colloquially as a \\"diamond\\"). Often referred to as the \\"first shirt\\", or \\"shirt\\", the first sergeant is responsible for the morale, welfare, and conduct of all the enlisted members in a squadron and is the chief adviser to the squadron commander concerning the enlisted force. While both services don't have an actual, separate first sergeant rank, those who hold these positional billets are senior to their non-diamond counterparts.  Group superintendent  Group superintendents fall under special reporting identifier coding with a 9G100 Air Force specialty code. Group superintendents provide leadership, management, and guidance in organizing, equipping, training, and mobilizing groups to meet home station and expeditionary mission requirements. Group superintendents work closely with their group commanders and command chief master sergeants to prepare the enlisted force to best execute mission requirements. They manage and direct resource activities as well as interpret and enforce policies and applicable directives. They also establish control procedures to meet mission goals and standards. Additionally, they recommend or initiate actions to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency as well as ensure that the management of personnel and resources are consistent with current practices and procedures in support of the wing‚Äôs mission. They resolve issues between subordinate squadrons, other groups, wing staff, and outside agencies as well as perform other duties as directed by their group commanders.Air Force Instruction 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure  Squadron Superintendent  The duty position of squadron superintendent is the senior enlisted advisor to a unit commander.  Senior enlisted advisors  Command chief master sergeant Command chief master sergeant insignia  Command Chief Master Sergeant  The position of command chief master sergeant (CCM) is unique as it is considered a rank and billet. Formerly, the billets were called senior enlisted advisors and were held by a chief master sergeant. These billets was turned into a permanent rank of command chief master sergeants in November 1998. Command chief master sergeants serve as the senior enlisted advisors to commanders at key levels of command; these include Wings, Numbered Air Forces, Field Operating Agencies, and Major Commands. In a Joint Command, when an Air Force Chief fills a DoD-nominated Command senior enlisted advisor position (see note), that individual is also designated as a Command Chief. Command Chiefs advise the unit commanders on all enlisted matters, including all issues affecting the command's mission and operations, and the readiness, training, utilization, morale, technical and professional development, and quality of life of all enlisted members in the organization. Command Chiefs hold a reporting identifier of 9E000. CCMs provide leadership to the enlisted force and are the functional managers for group superintendents and first sergeants in their organizations. , additional text. , additional text.

Until his retirement in 2003, Chief Master Sergeant Norman Marous was the Air Force's senior-most chief master sergeant, having served in the Air Force since 1962. Marous left active duty in 1967 to spend 22 years in the USAF Reserve and National Guard before returning to active duty as a Chief Master Sergeant in 1989. He retired in 2003 with 41¬Ω years of service. He is the only person authorized to wear two longevity ribbons, due to the space required for the number of multiple award devices authorized.The Long and Winding Road, Airman Magazine, July 2003, by Scott Wagers Indelible impressions, Airman's Notebook, July, 2003  Use in the Philippines  Chief master sergeant is also the highest attainable rank for enlisted personnel of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy); since 2004 as part of the ongoing modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Above the rank is that of first chief master sergeant, created also in the same year and is bestowed on the most veteran NCO who has served in the aforementioned service branches. The rank stands above that of senior master sergeant. The equivalent naval rating is that of master chief petty officer.

Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells. Imatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. A generic version became available in the UK as of 2017. Medical uses Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies. In 2006 the FDA expended approved use to include Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD), Aggressive systemic mastocytosis. (ASM). Chronic myelogenous leukemia The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and newly diagnosed. Due in part to the development of imatinib and related drugs, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia increased from 31% in 1993, to 59% in 2009, to 70% in 2016. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors The FDA first granted approval for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors to help prevent recurrence. The drug is also approved in unresectable KIT-positive GISTs.  Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)  The FDA granted approval for the treatment of DFSP patients in 2006. Specifically adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Prior to approval DFSP was considered unresponsive to chemotherapy treatments. Other The FDA has approved imatinib for use in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRŒ± fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRŒ± fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL. For treatment of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I, early research has shown potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib. Contraindications and cautions The only known contraindication to imatinib is hypersensitivity to imatinib. Cautions include: * Hepatic impairment * Risk of severe CHF or left ventricular dysfunction, especially in patients with comorbidities * Pregnancy, risk of embryo-fetal toxicity * Risk of fluid retention * Risk of growth stunting in children or adolescents Side effects CML, inhibited by imatinib (red; small molecule). The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite; weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema. Although rare, restoration of hair color has been reported as well. Severe congestive cardiac failure is an uncommon but recognized side effect of imatinib and mice treated with large doses of imatinib show toxic damage to their myocardium. If imatinib is used in prepubescent children, it can delay normal growth, although a proportion will experience catch-up growth during puberty. Overdose Medical experience with imatinib overdose is limited. Treatment is supportive. Imatinib is highly plasma protein-bound: dialysis is unlikely to be helpful removing imatinib. Mechanism of action Mechanism of action of imatinib Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the TK active site, leading to a decrease in activity. There are a large number of TK enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the TK domain in abl (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity. The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self- inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively.Takimoto CH, Calvo E. \\"Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy\\" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds)Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach . 11 ed. 2008. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. Imatinib is quite selective for bcr-abl, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 ‚Äì an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits the abl protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death. Other pathways affected The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including * the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. * It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. * The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. * The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation. Drug Synthesis 1200px Pharmacokinetics Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the liver and is mediated by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, N-demethylated piperazine derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Interactions Its use is advised against in people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, ritonavir and nefazodone due to its reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates of any of these enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism. As with other immunosuppressants, application of live vaccines is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. Inactivated and toxoid vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy. History Imatinib was invented in the late 1990s by scientists at Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz in 1996 to become Novartis), in a team led by biochemist Nicholas Lydon and that included Elisabeth Buchdunger and J√ºrg ZimmermannStaff, Innovation.org (a project of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America)The Story of Gleevec and its use to treat CML was driven by oncologist Brian Druker of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, a physician, scientist, and hematologist at University of Milano Bicocca, Italy, John Goldman at Hammersmith Hospital in London, UK, and later on by Charles Sawyers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Imatinib was developed by rational drug design. After the Philadelphia chromosome mutation and hyperactive bcr-abl protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With high-throughput screening, they identified 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib. When Novartis tested imatinib in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys in 1996, it was found to have several toxic effects; in particular, results indicating liver damage in dogs nearly stopped drug development completely. However, favorable results in studies with monkeys and in vitro human cells allowed testing to continue in humans.. The first clinical trial of Gleevec took place in 1998, after Novartis reluctantly synthesized and released a few grams of the drug for Druker, enough for him to run a trial using a hundred or so patients. The drug received FDA approval in May 2001, only two and a half years after the new drug application was submitted.Novartis press release, 10 May 2001. FDA approves Novartis' unique cancer medication Glivec On the same month it made the cover of TIME magazine as a \\"bullet\\" to be used against cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2009 for \\"converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition\\". During the FDA review, the tradename of the drug for the US market was changed from \\"Glivec\\" to \\"Gleevec\\" at the request of the FDA, to avoid confusion with Glyset, a diabetes drug.Cohen MH et al. Approval Summary for Imatinib Mesylate Capsules in the Treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Clin Cancer Res May 2002 8; 935Margot J. Fromer for Oncology Times. December 2002. What's in a Name? Quite a Lot When It Comes to Marketing & Selling New Cancer Drugs Novartis Press Release. 30 April 2001 Novartis Oncology Changes Trade Name of Investigational Agent Glivec to Gleevec in the United States A Swiss patent application was filed on imatinib and various salts on in April 1992, which was then filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and European patent offices issued patents listing J√ºrg Zimmermann as the inventor. In July 1997, Novartis filed a new patent application in Switzerland on the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (the mesylate salt of imatinib). The \\"beta crystalline form\\" of the molecule is a specific polymorph of imatinib mesylate; a specific way that the individual molecules pack together to form a solid. This is the actual form of the drug sold as Gleevec/Glivec; a salt (imatinib mesylate) as opposed to a free base, and the beta crystalline form as opposed to the alpha or other form.Staff, European Medicines Agency, 2004.EMEA Scientific Discussion of Glivec In 1998, Novartis filed international patent applications claiming priority to the 1997 filing.Note: The Indian patent application, which became the subject of litigation in India that gathered a lot of press, does not appear to be publicly available. However according to documents produced in the course of that litigation (page 27), \\"The Appellant's application under the PCT was substantially on the same invention as had been made in India.\\" A United States patent was granted in 2005.  Society and culture  Economics A box of 400-milligram Glivec tablets (Novartis), as sold in Germany. In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high that people in the United States couldn't afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. Other physicians have complained about the cost. Druker himself, who led the clinical studies, never got a patent and never made money from it. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to a year, according to an analysis prepared for The Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them. A 2012 economic analysis funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb estimated that the discovery and development of imatinib and related drugs had created $143 billion in societal value at a cost to consumers of approximately $14 billion. The $143 billion figure was based on an estimated 7.5 to 17.5 year survival advantage conferred by imatinib treatment, and included the value (discounted at 3% per annum) of ongoing benefits to society after the imatinib patent expiration. Prices for a 100 mg pill of Gleevec internationally range from $20 to $30,Patented Medicine Review Board (Canada). Report on New Patented Drugs ‚Äì Gleevec. although generic imatinib is cheaper, as low as $2 per pill.  Controversies   Patent litigation in India  Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law, the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a \\"mailbox\\" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect. The patent applicationNote: The Indian patent application No.1602/MAS/1998 does not appear to be publicly available. However according to the decision of the IPAB on 26 June 2009 (page 27) discussed below, \\"The Appellant's application under the PCT was substantially on the same invention as had been made in India.\\" claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate).Staff, European Medicines Agency, 2004. EMEA Scientific Discussion of Glivec In 1993, during the time India did not allow patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications, were that 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt ‚Äì imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec ‚Äì the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules) ‚Äì while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline.Indian Supreme Court Decision paragraphs 5‚Äì6 As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003.Novartis v UoI, para 8‚Äì9 Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India.R. Jai Krishna and Jeanne Whalen for the Wall Street Journal. 1 April 2013 Novartis Loses Glivec Patent Battle in India When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if \\"they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.\\"Shamnad Basheer for Spicy IP 11 March 2006 First Mailbox Opposition (Gleevec) Decided in India Intellectual Property Appellate Board decision dated 26 June 2009, p 149 At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal.W.P. No.24759 of 2006 Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case. The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Section 3d. The Supreme Court issued its decision in 2013, ruling that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts. Research One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who had the D816V mutation in c-KIT. However, since imatinib binds to tyrosine kinases when they are in the inactive configuration and the D816V mutant of c-KIT is constitutively active, imatinib does not inhibit the kinase activity of the D816V mutant of c-KIT. Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis. Imatinib was initially thought to have a potential role in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end. In systemic sclerosis, the drug has been tested for potential use in slowing down pulmonary fibrosis. In laboratory settings, imatinib is being used as an experimental agent to suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by inhibiting its receptor (PDGF-RŒ≤). One of its effects is delaying atherosclerosis in mice without or with diabetes. Mouse animal studies have suggested that imatinib and related drugs may be useful in treating smallpox, should an outbreak ever occur. In vitro studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood‚Äìbrain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer's, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms. A formulation of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier to overcome the blood‚Äìbrain barrier is also currently considered as an experimental drug for lowering and reversing opioid tolerance. Imatinib has shown reversal of tolerance in rats.Eliminating Morphine Tolerance ‚Äì Reformulated Imatinib 23 Feb 2012, 5:00 PST Imatinib is an experimental drug in the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis.

Biography Jacob Bekenstein was born in Mexico City to Joseph and Esther (n√©e Vladaslavotsky), Polish Jews who immigrated to Mexico. He moved to the United States during his early life, gaining U.S. citizenship in 1968. He was also a citizen of Israel. Bekenstein attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now known as the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, obtaining both an undergraduate degree and a Master of Science degree in 1969. He went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Princeton University, working under the direction of John Archibald Wheeler, in 1972. Bekenstein had three children with his wife, Bilha. All three children, Yehonadav, Uriya and Rivka Bekenstein, became scientists. In 2018, Yehonadav joined the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Technion as an assistant professor. Bekenstein was known as a religious man and a believer, being quoted as saying: \\"I look at the world as a product of God, He set very specific laws and we delight in discovering them through scientific work.\\" Scientific career By 1972, Bekenstein had published three influential papers about the black hole stellar phenomenon, postulating the no-hair theorem and presenting a theory on black hole thermodynamics. In the years to come, Bekenstein continued his exploration of black holes, publishing papers on their entropy and quantum mass. Bekenstein was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin from 1972 to 1974. He then immigrated to Israel to lecture and teach at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba. In 1978, he became a full professor and in 1983, head of the astrophysics department. In 1990, he became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was appointed head of its theoretical physics department three years later. He was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1997. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2009 and 2010.Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars In addition to lectures and residencies around the world, Bekenstein continued to serve as Polak professor of theoretical physics at the Hebrew University until his death at the age of 68, in Helsinki, Finland. He died unexpectedly on August 16, 2015, just months after receiving the American Physical Society's Einstein Prize \\"for his ground- breaking work on black hole entropy, which launched the field of black hole thermodynamics and transformed the long effort to unify quantum mechanics and gravitation\\". Contributions to physics In 1972, Bekenstein was the first to suggest that black holes should have a well-defined entropy. He wrote that a black hole's entropy was proportional to the area of its (the black hole's) event horizon. Bekenstein also formulated the generalized second law of thermodynamics, black hole thermodynamics, for systems including black holes. Both contributions were affirmed when Stephen Hawking (and, independently, Zeldovich and others) proposed the existence of Hawking radiation two years later. Hawking had initially opposed Bekenstein's idea on the grounds that a black hole could not radiate energy and therefore could not have entropy.Overbye, Dennis, Jacob Bekenstein, Physicist, dies at 68; revolutionized the study of black holes, New York Times, August 22, 2015, p.B7 However, in 1974, Hawking performed a lengthy calculation that convinced him that particles can indeed be emitted from black holes. Today this is known as Hawking radiation. Bekenstein's doctoral adviser, John Archibald Wheeler, also worked with him to develop the no-hair theorem, a reference to Wheeler's saying that \\"black holes have no hair,\\" in the early 1970s.The Big Bang: A View from the 21st Century (2003) by David M. Harland, pp. 227‚Äì8, Bekenstein's suggestion was proven unstable, but it was influential in the development of the field. Based on his black-hole thermodynamics work, Bekenstein also demonstrated the Bekenstein bound: there is a maximum to the amount of information that can potentially be stored in a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy (which is similar to the holographic principle). In 1982, Bekenstein developed a rigorous framework to generalize the laws of electromagnetism to handle inconstant physical constants. His framework replaces the fine-structure constant by a scalar field. However, this framework for changing constants did not incorporate gravity.Possibilities in Parallel: Seeking the Multiverse (2013) by the editors of Scientific American, In 2004, Bekenstein boosted Mordehai Milgrom's theory of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) by developing a relativistic version. It is known as TeVeS for Tensor/Vector/Scalar and it introduces three different fields in space time to replace the one gravitational field.

Palm Beach is located north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Palm Beach sits on a peninsula at the end of Barrenjoey Road, between Pittwater and Broken Bay.Sydway street directory, 11th Edition 2006, Maps 159-160 The population of Palm Beach was 1,593 as at the . Palm Beach is sometimes colloquially referred to as 'Palmy'; and is used for exterior filming of the soap opera Home and Away, as the fictional town of Summer Bay. It is also the subject of the 2018 film 'Palm Beach'.. Despite the hefty property prices it remains a haven for a variety of artists. Writing celebrating this beach is featured in ‚ÄúGuide to Sydney Beaches‚Äù Meuse Press. http:// sydneybeaches.tripod.com/guide.htm. Palm Beach housing ranges from cottages to grand estates, owned by some of the country's most affluent people. Many affluent and famous people can also be found holidaying at Palm Beach in summer. According to the Australian Taxation Office statistics for the financial year of 2016-2017, Palm Beach and the post code of 2108 was the wealthiest suburb in Australia, with an average taxable income of $230,000.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-28/australias-richest-and- poorest-postcodes-revealed-for-2016-17/10949790 Geography Palm Beach is bounded by Broken Bay to the north, the Tasman Sea (within the South Pacific Ocean) to the east, Whale Beach, Avalon and Clareville to the south, and Pittwater to the west. Barrenjoey Headland, which is in the north of the suburb, is part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. The headland at the northernmost point rises quite sharply from the beach to over above sea level, and features an operational lighthouse. The narrow sandy isthmus or tombolo linking the south side of the headland to the rest of Palm Beach had extensive fencing and shrub planting undertaken during the 1980s to combat sand erosion. Localities The suburb of Palm Beach also contains the following localities: Barrenjoey, Sand Point, Careel Bay, Paradise Beach, and North Avalon. Reserves and bushland Along the cliffs and sanddunes there is much remnant bushland vegetation, located in reserves and national parks, with Barrenjoey headland being part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. These reserves often contain endangered ecological communities, such as Littoral Rainforest, and Pittwater spotted gum forest. See, for example, the articles, McKay Reserve, and Barrenjoey. Landmarks Barrenjoey Headland and Station Beach viewed from West Head Landmarks include the Barrenjoey Lighthouse, Palm Beach-Boanbong Water Reservoir, Palm Beach-McKay Water Reservoir, Palm Beach- Squaters Lodge, Blueberry Ash, and Iluka Resort Apartments. The long east- facing eponymous beach curves in a gentle arc between the prominent high, lighthouse capped, Barrenjoey Head to the sandstone rocks of Little Head in the south, beach linking Barrenjoey to the mainland. North Palm Beach extends south from Barrenjoey, with the northern backed by a wide densely vegetated foredune. The southern Palm Beach section includes the southern of beach, which curves to the southeast in the southern Kiddies Corner. It receives increasing protection from Little Head with waves decreasing in height down the beach. Rips usually extend all the way to the head, though usually smaller in size, with a weak permanent rip against the southern rocks. History Barrenjoey, beyond the lighthouse, 10 March 2018 (before the fire of 28/09/2013) Barrenjoey, beyond the lighthouse, March 3, 2017. Regeneration after the fire of 28/09/2013 Origin of the name The southern end of the Palm Beach is marked as Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour on a map of 1832. Palm Beach was later named after the Cabbage Tree palms livistona australis that were near Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour. The plant's species name gave origin to Livistona Lane, off Palm Beach Road. European settlement Governor Philip explored the area in 1788, and named the headland 'Barrenjuee', which was an indigenous word apparently meaning 'young kangaroo'. In 1816, Palm Beach, Barrenjoey and most of Whale Beach () was granted to James Napper. During the 19th century, a few Europeans and Chinese lived at Snapperman Beach catching and drying fish. The Southern end of the ocean beach is marked as Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour on a map of 1832. Palm Beach was later named after the Cabbage Tree palms livistona australis. In 1900 all land, except Barrenjoey Headland, which had been purchased by the government in 1881, was divided into 18 large blocks, listed as good grazing land, and offered for sale. None sold. In 1912, the land was offered again in smaller residential blocks, offering fishing, sailing, golf and rowing. Most houses were built from local sandstone, other materials were shipped in. Some were guest houses but most were second homes for those who could afford them. Palm Beach wharf was the terminus reached by boat from Newport or Bayview. Hordern and Wiltshire Parks and Mackay Reserve were donated by RJ Hordern, who lived at Kalua, opposite the beach. Since World War II the area has become more residential but still remains a secluded peninsula at the northern point of Pittwater.

The mosque was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. An inscription specifies the foundation date as 1550 and the inauguration date as 1557. Behind the qibla wall of the mosque is an enclosure containing the separate octagonal mausoleums of Suleiman the Magnificent and that of his wife Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana). For 462 years, the S√ºleymaniye Mosque was the largest mosque in the city, until it was surpassed by the √áamlƒ±ca Mosque in 2019. The S√ºleymaniye Mosque is one of the best-known sights of Istanbul, and from its location on the Third Hill, it commands a spectacular view of the city around the Golden Horn. History Cornelius Gurlitt in 1912 The S√ºleymaniye Mosque, was built on the order of Sultan S√ºleyman (S√ºleyman the Magnificent), and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. The Arabic foundation inscription above the north portal of the mosque is carved in thuluth script on three marble panels. It gives a foundation date of 1550 and an inauguration date of 1557. In reality the planning of the mosque began before 1550 and parts of the complex were not completed until after 1557. The design of the S√ºleymaniye also plays on Suleyman's self-conscious representation of himself as a 'second Solomon.' It references the Dome of the Rock, which was built on the site of the Temple of Solomon, as well as Justinian's boast upon the completion of the Hagia Sophia: \\"Solomon, I have surpassed thee!\\" The S√ºleymaniye, similar in magnificence to the preceding structures, asserts Suleyman's historical importance. The structure is nevertheless smaller in size than its older archetype, the Hagia Sophia. The S√ºleymaniye was damaged in the great fire of 1660 and was restored by Sultan Mehmed IV. Part of the dome collapsed during the earthquake of 1766. Subsequent repairs damaged what was left of the original decoration of Sinan (recent cleaning has shown that Sinan experimented first with blue, before making red the dominant color of the dome). During World War I the courtyard was used as a weapons depot, and when some of the ammunition ignited, the mosque suffered another fire. Not until 1956 was it fully restored again. The construction of the Hali√ß Metro Bridge in 2013 has irreparably altered the view of the mosque from north. Architecture Exterior North facade with the forecourt and the central fountain Like the other imperial mosques in Istanbul, the entrance to the mosque itself is preceded by a forecourt with a central fountain. The courtyard is of exceptional grandeur with a colonnaded peristyle with columns of marble, granite and porphyry. The northwest facade of the mosque is decorated with rectangular Iznik tile window lunettes. The mosque is the first building where the Iznik tiles include the brightly coloured tomato red clay under the glaze. At the four corners of the courtyard are the four minarets. The two taller minarets have three galleries (serifes) and rise to a high of without their lead caps and including the caps. Four minarets were used for mosques endowed by a sultan (princes and princesses could construct two minarets; others only one). The minarets have a total of 10 galleries, which by tradition indicates that Suleiman I was the 10th Ottoman sultan. The main dome is high and has a diameter of which is exactly half the height. At the time it was built, the dome was the highest in the Ottoman Empire, when measured from sea level, but still lower from its base and smaller in diameter than that of Hagia Sophia. Interior Interior looking towards the mihrab The interior of the mosque is almost a square, in length and in width, forming a single vast space. The dome is flanked by semi-domes, and to the north and south arches with tympana-filled windows, supported by enormous porphyry monoliths. Sinan decided to make a radical architectural innovation to mask the huge north-south buttresses needed to support these central piers. He incorporated the buttresses into the walls of the building, with half projecting inside and half projecting outside, and then hid the projections by building colonnaded galleries. There is a single gallery inside the structure, and a two-story gallery outside. The interior decoration is restrained with stained-glass windows restricted to the qibla wall. Iznik tile revetments are only used around the mihrab. The repeating rectangular tiles have a stencil- like floral pattern on a white ground. The flowers are mainly blue with turquoise, red and black but green is not used. On either side of the mihrab are large Iznik tile calligraphic roundels with text from the Al-Fatiha surah of the Quran (1:1‚Äì7). The white marble mihrab and mimbar are also simple in design, and woodwork is restrained, with simple designs in ivory and mother of pearl. Mausoleums Mausoleum of Suleiman the Magnificent In the walled enclosure behind the qibla wall of the mosque are the separate mausoleums (t√ºrbe) of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana). Hurrem Sultan's octagonal mausoleum is dated 1558, the year of her death. The 16 sided interior is decorated with Iznik tiles. The seven rectangular windows are surmounted by tiled lunettes and epigraphic panels. Between the windows are eight mihrab-like hooded niches. The ceiling is now whitewashed but was probably once painted in bright colours. The much larger octagonal mausoleum of Suleiman the Magnificent bears the date of 1566, the year of his death, but it was probably not completed until the following year. The mausoleum is surrounded by a peristyle with a roof supported by 24 columns and has the entrance facing east rather than the usual north. Under the portico on either side of the entrance are Iznik tiled panels. These are the earliest tiles that are decorated with the bright emerald green colour that would become a common feature of Iznik ceramics. The interior has a false dome supported on eight columns within the outer shell. There are 14 windows set at ground level and an additional 24 windows with stained glass set in the tympana under the arches. The walls and the pendentives are covered with polychrome Iznik tiles. Around the room above the windows is a band of inscriptive tiled panels. The text quotes the Throne verse and the following two verses from the Quran (2:255-58). In addition to the tomb of Suleiman the Magnificent, the mausoleum houses the tombs of his daughter Mihrimah Sultan and those of two later sultans: Suleiman II (ruled 1687‚Äì1691) and Ahmed II (ruled 1691‚Äì1695). Complex As with other imperial mosques in Istanbul, the S√ºleymaniye Mosque was designed as a k√ºlliye, or complex with adjacent structures to service both religious and cultural needs. The original complex consisted of the mosque itself, a hospital (dar√º≈ü≈üifa), primary school, public baths (hamam), a caravanserai, four Qur'an schools (medrese), a specialized school for the learning of hadith, a medical college, and a public kitchen (imaret) which served food to the poor. Many of these structures are still in existence, and the former imaret is now a noted restaurant. The former hospital is now a printing factory owned by the Turkish Army. Just outside the mosque walls, to the north is the tomb of architect Sinan. It was completely restored in 1922.

Umber is darker than the other similar earth pigments, ochre and sienna. In its natural form, it is called raw umber. When heated (calcinated), the color becomes more intense, and then becomes known as burnt umber. The name comes from terra d'ombra, or earth of Umbria, the Italian name of the pigment. Umbria is a mountainous region in central Italy where the pigment was originally extracted. The word also may be related to the Latin word ombra, meaning \\"shadow\\". Umber is not one precise color, but a range of different colors, from medium to dark, from yellowish to reddish to grayish. The color of the natural earth depends upon the amount of iron oxide and manganese in the clay. Umber earth pigments contain between five and twenty percent manganese oxide, which accounts for their being a darker color than yellow ochre or sienna. Commercial colors vary depending upon the manufacturer or the color list. Not all umber pigments contain natural earths; some contain synthetic iron and manganese oxide, indicated on the label. Pigments containing the natural umber earths indicate them on the label as PBr7 (Pigment brown 7), following the Colour Index International system. History Umber was one of the first pigments used by humans; it is found along with carbon black, red and yellow ocher in cave paintings from the Neolithic period. Dark brown pigments were rarely used in Medieval art; artists of that period preferred bright, distinct colors such as red, blue and green. The umbers were not widely used in Europe before the end of the fifteenth century; the Renaissance painter and writer Giorgio Vasari (1511‚Äì1574) described them as being rather new in his time. The great age of umber was the baroque period, where it often provided the dark shades in the chiaroscuro (light-dark) style of painting. It was an important part of the palette of Caravaggio (1571‚Äì1610) and Rembrandt (1606‚Äì1669). Rembrandt used it as an important element of his rich and complex browns, and he also took advantage of its other qualities; it dried more quickly than other browns, and therefore he often used it as a ground so he could work more quickly, or mixed it with other pigments to speed up the drying process. The Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer used umber to create shadows on whitewashed walls that were warmer and more harmonious than those created with black pigment. In the second half of the 19th century, the Impressionists rebelled against the use of umber and other earth colors. Camille Pissarro denounced the \\"old, dull earth colors\\" and said he had banned them from his palette. The impressionists chose to make their own browns from mixtures of red, yellow, green, blue and other pigments, particularly the new synthetic pigments such as cobalt blue and emerald green that had just been introduced. In the 20th century, natural umber pigments began to be replaced by pigments made with synthetic iron oxide and manganese oxide. Natural umber pigments are still being made, with Cyprus as a prominent source. Pigments containing the natural earths are labeled as PBr7, or Brown pigment 7. Varieties Raw umber Displayed at the right is one version of the color raw umber. Burnt umber Burnt umber is made by heating raw umber, which dehydrates the iron oxides and changes them partially to the more reddish hematite. It's used for both oil and water color paint. The first recorded use of burnt umber as a color name in English was in 1650.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 191; Color Sample of Burnt Umber: Page 53 Plate 15 Color Sample A12  See also  * Brown * List of colors * List of inorganic pigments References  * Sources and citations  External links  * ‚Äî Discussion of umber and its use by Vermeer and other painters.

He died in an avalanche on November 13, 1998, while skiing in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.  Biography  He was born at the Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, and named after his paternal grandfather, Charles-√âmile. Trudeau was known to family and friends as Miche, a nickname given to him as a four-month- old by Fidel Castro when he accompanied his father and mother to Cuba in 1976, and he later started going by Mike. Trudeau lived his early life in Ottawa and later Montreal upon his father's retirement from politics in 1984, where he was a classmate of Sophie Gr√©goire. During their summer breaks, Michel and his brothers attended Camp Ahmek on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park where he would later work as a camp counsellor. He studied at Coll√®ge Jean-de- Br√©beuf before attending Dalhousie University to study microbiology. When talking about her sons each having distinctly different personalities in an interview in 1977, Margaret Trudeau said, \\"Justin, 6, is a prince ‚Äî a very good little boy. Sasha (Alexandre), born Christmas Day, 1973, is a bit of a revolutionary, very determined and strong-willed. Miche (Michel) is a happy, well-adjusted child, who combined the best traits of both brothers.\\" Death Trudeau died as the result of an avalanche on November 13, 1998, aged 23. At the time, he had been working for about a year at Red Mountain Resort and living in Rossland, British Columbia. He was taking a backcountry skiing trip with some friends in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park when he was swept into Kokanee Lake and unable to reach the shore. His companions were unable to effect a rescue, and Trudeau drowned. An extensive search was launched, but his body has never been found. The lake's high altitude and limited days of open waters each year prevented divers from completing the search. The Trudeau family called off the recovery and later created a chalet nearby as a memorial to their youngest son.

Russia prevailed, but both sides wanted peace as they feared Napoleon's moves to the east.Virginia Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870: An Empire Besieged (Routledge, 2014) pp 261‚Äì270. Background The war broke out in 1805‚Äì1806 against the background of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1806, Sultan Selim III, encouraged by the Russian defeat at Austerlitz and advised by the French Empire, deposed the pro-Russian Constantine Ypsilantis as Hospodar of the Principality of Wallachia and Alexander Mourousis as Hospodar of Moldavia, both Ottoman vassal states. Simultaneously, the French Empire occupied Dalmatia and threatened to penetrate the Danubian principalities at any time. In order to safeguard the Russian border against a possible French attack, a 40,000-strong Russian contingent advanced into Moldavia and Wallachia. The Sultan reacted by blocking the Dardanelles to Russian ships and declared war on Russia. Early hostilities Initially, Emperor Alexander I was reluctant to concentrate large forces against the Ottoman Empire while his relations with Napoleonic France were still uncertain and the main part of his army was occupied fighting against Napoleon in Prussia. A massive Ottoman offensive aimed at Russian-occupied Bucharest, the Wallachian capital, was promptly checked at Obilesti by as few as 4,500 soldiers commanded by Mikhail Miloradovich (June 2, 1807). In Armenia, the 7,000-strong contingent of Count Gudovich destroyed the Turkish force of 20,000 at Arpachai (June 18). In the meantime, the Russian Imperial Navy under Dmitry Senyavin blockaded the Dardanelles and defeated the Ottoman fleet in the Battle of the Dardanelles, after which Selim III was deposed. The Ottoman fleet was destroyed the following month in the Battle of Athos, thus establishing Russian supremacy on sea. Campaigns of 1808‚Äì10 At this point the war might have ended, if it were not for the Peace of Tilsit. The Russian Emperor, constrained by Napoleon to sign an armistice with the Turks, used the time of peace to transfer more Russian soldiers from Prussia to Bessarabia. After the southern army was augmented to 80,000 and the hostilities were resumed, the 76-year-old commander-in-chief Prozorovsky made little progress in more than a year. In August 1809 he was eventually succeeded by Prince Bagration, who promptly crossed the Danube and overran Dobruja. Bagration proceeded to lay siege to Silistra but, on hearing that the 50,000-strong Turkish army approached the city, deemed it wise to evacuate Dobruja and retreat to Bessarabia. In 1810, the hostilities were renewed by the brothers Nikolay and Sergei Kamensky, who defeated the Ottoman reinforcement heading for Silistra and ousted the Turks from Hacƒ±oƒülu Pazarcƒ±k (May 22). The position of Silistra now appeared hopeless, and the garrison surrendered on May, 30. Ten days later, Kamensky laid siege to another strong fortress, Shumla (or Schumen). His storm of the citadel was repelled at great loss of life, and more bloodshed ensued during the storming of the Danubian port of Rousse (or Rustchuk) on 22 July. The latter fortress did not fall to the Russians until 9 September, after Kamensky's army had surprised and routed a huge Turkish detachment at Batyn on 26 August. On 26 October, Kamensky again defeated a 40,000-strong army of Osman Pasha at Vidin. Russians lost only 1,500 men, compared with 10,000 for their opponents. However the young Nikolay Kamensky caught a serious illness on February 4, 1811 and died soon thereafter, left the army under the command of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron. To this point, although the Russians had won many battles, they had failed to achieve any important victories that would force the Ottomans to end the war. Furthermore, relationship between France and Russia quickly became strained, pointing to the inevitable renewal of hostilities between the countries. The Russian Empire found that she needed to end the southern war quickly in order to concentrate on dealing with Napoleon. In such a situation, Tsar Alexander appointed his disfavoured general Mikhail Kutuzov to be the new commander of the Russian force.  Kutuzov's campaigns (1811‚Äì12)  Mikhail Kutuzov, in accordance with his cautious character, evacuated Silistria and slowly started to retreat northward. Kutuzov's withdrawal induced the Turks to launch a counter-offensive to recapture all the lost area. In 1811, 60,000 Turkish troops led by Grand Vizier Lal Aziz Ahmet Pasha gathered at Shumla, the strongest Turkish fortress at that time. Kutuzov's troops were only about 46,000 men who were tired after five consecutive years of war. However, the Russian commander had plenty of experience fighting the Turks: he knew that the Turks were only strong at the initial cavalry offensive and then its strength would rapidly decline after this cavalry assault was repelled; so the Russians had a great advantage when fighting in open battle. That battle took place on 22 June 1811 near Rousse. As expected, the Russian infantry and cannons quickly repelled the Turkish troops and then defeated the Turkish army. This victory gained Kutuzov a portrait of Tsar Alexander I. But after that Kutuzov ordered his forces to cross the Danube to Bessarabia. This odd retreat made the Turks think that they won: a big party was held in Constantinople to celebrate the Turks' \\"victory\\". Alexander became very angry and demand an explanation. However, Kutuzov had a secret plan behind that strange act and he decided to keep quiet for a while. Seeing that the Russians had retreated, the Turks prepared to launch a new attack. Several months later 70,000 Turkish troops led by Lal Aziz Ahmet Pasha crossed the Danube river to assault the Russians. The main force (50,000 personnel) garrisoned the west bank, facing the Russian forces. The remaining 20,000 garrisoned at the east bank, guarding the ammunition and provisions. On the night of 2 November 1811 a separate Russian cavalry detachment secretly crossed the Danube and assaulted the east-bank Turkish troops, slew 9,000 troops and captured the remaining ones with all the Turks' provisions. The Russian casualties were low, about 25 cavalrymen and nine Cossack troops killed in action. Right after that, all the Russian forces attacked and quickly encircled the main Turkish army on the left-bank. Kutuzov then received information that Lal Aziz Ahmet Pasha was trying to escape the encirclement himself. The Russian commander let Ahmet escape because he knew that, according to Turkish law, the encircled Grand Vizier could not take part in peace negotiations - and peace is what Kutuzov needed. After that, Kutuzov contacted Ahmet to congratulate him on his successful escape and offer peace negotiations. But the Grand Vizier still hoped for reinforcements and tried to procrastinate. In response, the Russians took all the surrounding forts and cut all the supply lines to the encircled Turks. With all the supply lines being cut off, the encircled Turks were threatened by hunger and disease. Kutuzov proposed supplying the Turks with food and provisions to allow them to survive. Tsar Alexander I did not agree with Kutuzov's idea, but Kutuzov explained that by keeping the Turks alive, he actually was holding a larger number of hostages and that would force the Sultan to negotiate. The plan was successful and on 28 May 1812 the Treaty of Bucharest was signed. Caucasus front Six years of war on the eastern front left the border unchanged. Fighting here was more serious than during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1792, but it was still a sideshow to the main action. Russia crossed the Caucasus and annexed Georgia, the western half of which had been nominally Turkish. It also had taken the Persian vassal khanates along the Caspian coast and east of Georgia. The area around modern Armenia (Erivan Khanate and Nakhichevan Khanate) was still Persian. Russia was also at war with Persia but the Turks and Persians did not help each other. A large part of the Russian army was tied up because of Napoleon's threat in the west. The Russian Viceroys were 1806: Ivan Gudovich, 1809: Alexander Tormasov, 1811: Filippo Paulucci, 1812: Nikolay Rtishchev.John F. Baddeley, Russian Conquest of the Caucasus (1908), Chapter V Fighting with Turkey began in 1807 with the swift seizure of Anapa by Admiral Pustoshkin. Gudovich led his main force toward Akhaltsikhe but lost 900 men while trying to storm Akhalkalaki and withdrew to Georgia. Secondary campaigns against Kars and Poti also failed. The Turks took the offensive, failed three times to take Gyumri and then were completely defeated by Gudovich (Battle of Arpachai). He was congratulated by the Shah, an interesting comment on the relations between the two Muslim empires. Gudovich was replaced by Count Tormasov who arrived about April 1809. In 1810 Poti on the coast was captured. A Turkish invasion was blocked by General Paulucci under the walls Akhalkalaki. In November 1810 a Russian attack on Akhaltsikhe failed due to an outbreak of plague. In 1811 Tormasov was recalled at his own request and replaced by Paulucci in Transcaucasia, Rtishchev taking over the Northern Line. In 1811 more troops were withdrawn to deal with the expected threat of Napoleon. Turks and Persians agreed on a joint attack toward Gyumri. They met at ‚ÄôMagasberd‚Äô {location?} on 30Aug11. There a Kurd assassinated the Seraskar of Ezerum and this caused the forces to break up. Paulucci sent Pyotr Kotlyarevsky against Akhalkalaki. He made a forced march over the snow-covered mountains, avoiding the main roads, attacked at night, and had storming parties on the walls before the Turks knew the Russians were there. By the morning of 10 December he held the fort with a loss of only 30 killed and wounded. For this he was promoted to Major-General at the age of 29. On 21 February 1812 5000 Turks failed to re-take Akhalkalaki. Three days later they were defeated at Parghita {location?}. Paulucci was sent west to command troops against Napoleon, and Rtishchev became commander of forces on both sides of the Caucasus mountains. Russia decided to make peace. By the Treaty of Bucharest (1812), signed in May just before the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, Turkey gave up Bassarabia in the west but regained nearly all it had lost in the east: Poti, Anapa and Akhalkalali. Russia retained Sukhum-Kale on the Abkhazian coast. Aftermath According to the Treaty, the Ottoman Empire ceded the eastern half of Moldavia to Russia (which renamed the territory as Bessarabia), although it had committed to protecting that region. Russia became a new power in the lower Danube area, and had an economically, diplomatically, and militarily profitable frontier. In Transcaucasia, the frontier remained virtually unchanged as the Russians returned much of the land that they had captured during the conflict.F. Ismail, \\"The making of the treaty of Bucharest, 1811-1812,\\" Middle Eastern Studies (1979) 15#2 pp 163-192 online. The treaty was approved by Alexander I of Russia on June 11, some 13 days before Napoleon's invasion of Russia began. The commanders were able to get many of the Russian soldiers in the Balkans back to the western areas before the expected attack of Napoleon.

Because of the suffering American economy, many boxers were offered lower amounts of money causing them to only box for passion. When the decade began, the world heavy weight title belonged to no one. The sport of boxing suffered because of the lack of money to pay the boxers. The Heavyweights, from 1930 to 1937 in particular, could be compared to the Heavyweight division of the 1980s. Six champions were crowned before Joe Louis began his legendary run as Heavyweight champion in 1937. He retired in 1949, still holding the title of World Heavyweight Champion. Barney Ross Boxing began expanding into Latin America in the 1930s: Sixto Escobar became the first world champion from Puerto Rico by defeating Baby Casanova. Baby Arizmendi conquered the first world title for Mexico in 1934. For his part, Kid Chocolate became the first world champion from Cuba. Three world champions won world titles in three different divisions, a feat no single fighter had accomplished since 1903; Tony Canzoneri, Barney Ross and Henry Armstrong cemented their place in boxing history by achieving this feat. Armstrong was the first and only world champion to reign in three divisions at the same time; modern boxing rules ban boxers from holding the title in more than one division at a time. 1930 *February 10 ‚Äì In the decade's first world title fight, Jimmy Slattery becomes world Light-Heavyweight champion, beating Lou Scozza by decision in fifteen rounds for the vacant title, at Buffalo. *February 18 ‚Äì Jack Kid Berg becomes world Jr. Welterweight champion, knocking out Mushy Callahan in ten rounds, London, England *March 21 ‚Äì Midget Wolgast wins the vacant New York Flyweight title with a decision over Black Bill, New York City. *June 11 ‚Äì Max Schmeling wins the undisputed World Heavyweight title, defeating Jack Sharkey by a four- round disqualification, after being hit with a damaging low blow.

Studentexamen (Swedish for \\"students' examination\\" or \\"students' degree\\"), earlier also mogenhetsexamen (\\"maturity examination\\") was the name of the university entrance examination in Sweden from the 17th century to 1968. From 1862 to 1968, it was taken as a final written and oral exam on graduation from gymnasium (secondary school). In Finland the examination (Finnish: Ylioppilastutkinto) still exists (Finland parted from Sweden 1809). The exam traces its origin to the academic statutes from 1655 requiring the dean to examine students arriving at university before allowing matriculation. According to the school reglement of 1693, a prospective student was to have gone through both a final examination at school and an entrance examination at university. The school reglement of 1724 allowed students without a final examination from school to enroll at university, provided a person known at the university would guarantee their behaviour, which led to it becoming common for students (called sponsionsstudenter or kautionsstudenter) from wealthy families to be matriculated at a very young age, accompanied by a private tutor. Although these were not actually supposed to be allowed to graduate, this rule was not always strictly upheld. Attempts at a reform of the system led to the proposition in 1828 of the so-called Large Commission on Education, allowing students who had not completed a studentexamen to matriculate but disallowing them both from taking a degree or receiving any form of scholarship. The proposition also defined nine disciplines: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Modern languages, Theology, Philosophy, Mathematics, History with Geography and Natural history, of which the prospective student had to have a grade of approbatur (Latin; in Swedish godk√§nd) in six and admittitur (a lower grade, in Swedish called f√∂rsvarlig) in the three other to be allowed to enter university. These examinations were all oral, but a few years later, written examinations were introduced in Swedish and Latin. In 1864, the studentexamen was moved from the universities to the secondary schools. It was thus changed from being primarily an entrance examination to academic studies to being a graduation diploma from the gymnasium or l√§roverk. In order to retain some academic control over the standard, a system was conceived where the Crown would appoint \\"censors\\"SAOB, Vol. 5 (1903), column C 41, online edition, No. 4 a: \\"person som blifvit f√∂rordnad att vara n√§rvarande vid vissa examina, i sht mogenhetsexamen, o. vaka √∂fver att icke n√•gra underhaltiga examinander godk√§nnas\\" (\\"a person appointed to be present at certain examinations, esp. maturity examinations, and guard against the passing of incompetent examinees\\"). from the universities to take part in the examinations, and, if necessary, to fail a student passed by the teachers. The name of the examination was changed to mogenhetspr√∂vning or mogenhetsexamen (\\"maturity examination\\"), and was known under this name until 1905, when the name studentexamen was restored. With the new secondary school system (the gymnasieskola or \\"gymnasium school\\") introduced in 1968, the final examination or studentexamen was abolished, but the word is in colloquial use for the completion of secondary school, known as gymnasieexamen, based on grades from cumulative courses.

His apprentices would later design the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul and Stari Most in Mostar. The son of a stonemason, he received a technical education and became a military engineer. He rose rapidly through the ranks to become first an officer and finally a Janissary commander, with the honorific title of aƒüa.Goodwin (2001), p. 87 He refined his architectural and engineering skills while on campaign with the Janissaries, becoming expert at constructing fortifications of all kinds, as well as military infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges and aqueducts.Kinross (1977), pp 214‚Äì215 At about the age of fifty, he was appointed as chief royal architect, applying the technical skills he had acquired in the army to the \\"creation of fine religious buildings\\" and civic structures of all kinds. He remained in this post for almost fifty years. His masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, although his most famous work is the Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul. He headed an extensive governmental department and trained many assistants who, in turn, distinguished themselves, including Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, architect of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque. He is considered the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture and has been compared to Michelangelo, his contemporary in the West.De Osa, Veronica.Saoud (2007), p. 7 Michelangelo and his plans for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome were well known in Istanbul, since Leonardo da Vinci and he had been invited, in 1502 and 1505 respectively, by the Sublime Porte to submit plans for a bridge spanning the Golden Horn.Vasari (1963), Book IV, p. 122 Mimar Sinan's works are among the most influential buildings in history.http://home.howstuffworks.com/home- improvement/construction/planning/10-most-famous-architects2.htm Early years and background Bust of Mimar Sinan in Istanbul According to contemporary biographer, Mustafa S√¢i √áelebi, Sinan was born in 1489 (c. 1490 according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

Quoted from the book: \\"According to yet another view, Sinan came from a Christian Turkish family, whose father's name was Abdulmennan and his grandfather's Doƒüan Yusuf.\\" in a small town called Aƒüƒ±rnas near the city of Kayseri in Anatolia (as stated in an order by Sultan Selim II). According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Sinan had either Armenian or Greek origin. One argument that lends credence to his Armenian or Greek background is a decree by Selim II dated Ramadan 7 981 (ca. Dec. 30, 1573), which grants Sinan's request to forgive and spare his relatives from the general exile of Kayseri's Armenian communities to the island of Cyprus;This decree was published in the Turkish journal T√ºrk Tarihi Enc√ºmeni Mecmuasƒ±, vol. 1, no. 5 (June 1930-May 1931) p. 10. while Godfrey Goodwin stated that \\"after the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571, when Selim II decided to repopulate the island by transferring Rum (Orthodox Christian) families from the Karaman Eyalet, Sinan intervened on behalf of his family and obtained two orders from the Sultan in council exempting them from deportation.\\" According to some scholars, this means that his family was Cappadocian Greek because the only Orthodox Christians (Rums) of the region were Greeks.Constantinople, de Byzance √† Stamboul, Cel√¢l Esad Arseven, H. Laurens, 1909 According to Herbert J. Muller though, he \\"seems to have been an Armenian.\\" Lucy Der Manuelian of Tufts University suggests that \\"he can be identified as an Armenian through a document in the imperial archives and other evidence.\\" Several scholars have cited Sinan's possible Albanian origin. According to the British scholar Percy Brown and the Indian scholar Vidya Dhar Mahajan, the Mughal Emperor Babur was very dissatisfied with the local Indian architecture and planning, thus he invited \\"certain pupils of the leading Ottoman architect Sinan, the Albanian genius, to carry out his architectural schemes.\\". Sinan grew up helping his father in his work, and by the time that he was conscripted would have had a good grounding in the practicalities of building work.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Sinan (Ottoman architect) There are three brief records (Anonymous Text; Architectural Masterpieces; Book of Architecture) in the library of Topkapƒ± Palace, dictated by Sinan to his friend and biographer Mustafa S√¢i √áelebi. In these manuscripts, Sinan divulges some details of his youth and military career. His father is referred to as \\"Abd√ºlmennan\\" (literally \\"Servant of the Generous and Merciful One\\"), a title which was commonly used in the Ottoman period to define the non-Muslim father of a Muslim convert. Military career In 1512, Sinan was conscripted into Ottoman service under the devshirme system.Kinross, pp 214‚Äì215. He was sent to Constantinople to be trained as an officer of the Janissary Corps and converted to Islam. He was too old to be admitted to the imperial Enderun School in the Topkapƒ± Palace but was sent instead to an auxiliary school. Some records claim that he might have served the Grand Vizier Pargalƒ± ƒ∞brahim Pasha as a novice of the Ibrahim Pasha School. Possibly, he was given the Islamic name Sinan there. He initially learned carpentry and mathematics but through his intellectual qualities and ambitions, he soon assisted the leading architects and got his training as an architect. During the next six years, he also trained to be a Janissary officer (acemioƒülan). He possibly joined Selim I in his last military campaign, Rhodes according to some sources, but when the Sultan died, this project ended. Two years later he witnessed the conquest of Belgrade. Under the new sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, he was present, as a member of the Household Cavalry, at the Battle of Moh√°cs. He was promoted to captain of the Royal Guard and then given command of the Infantry Cadet Corps. He was later stationed in Austria, where he commanded the 62nd Orta of the Rifle Corps. He became a master of archery, while at the same time, as an architect, learning the weak points of structures when gunning them down. In 1535 he participated in the Baghdad campaign as a commanding officer of the Royal Guard. In 1537 he went on expeditions to Corfu and Apulia and Moldavia.Sinan (in Dictionary of Islamic Architecture) During these campaigns he proved himself an able architect and engineer. When the Ottoman army captured Cairo, Sinan was promoted to chief architect and was given the privilege of tearing down any buildings in the captured city that were not according to the city plan. During the campaign in the East, he assisted in the building of defences and bridges, such as a bridge across the Danube. He converted churches into mosques. During the Persian campaign in 1535 he built ships for the army and the artillery to cross Lake Van. For this he was given the title Haseki'i, Sergeant-at-Arms in the body guard of the Sultan, a rank equivalent to that of the Janissary Aƒüa. When Chelebi L√ºtfi Pasha became Grand Vizier in 1539, he appointed Sinan, who had previously served under his command, to the office of Architect of the Abode of Felicity. This was the start of a remarkable career. The job entailed the supervision infrastructure construction and the flow of supplies within the Ottoman Empire. He was also responsible for the design and construction of public works, such as roads, waterworks and bridges. Through the years he transformed his office into that of Architect of the Empire, an elaborate government department, with greater powers than his supervising minister. He became the head of a whole Corps of architects, training a team of assistants, deputies and pupils. Work His training as an army engineer gave Sinan an empirical approach to architecture rather than a theoretical one. But the same can be said of the great Western Renaissance architects, such as Brunelleschi and Michelangelo. Various sources state that Sinan was the architect of at least 374 structures which included 92 mosques; 52 small mosques (mescit); 55 schools of theology (medrese); 7 schools for Koran reciters (dar√ºlkurra); 20 mausoleums (t√ºrbe); 17 public kitchens (imaret); 3 hospitals (dar√º≈ü≈üifa); 6 aqueducts; 10 bridges; 20 caravanserais; 36 palaces and mansions; 8 vaults; and 48 baths.A list of the buildings designed by Mimar Sinan Sinan held the position of chief architect of the palace, which meant being the overseer of all construction work of the Ottoman Empire, for nearly 50 years, working with a large team of assistants consisting of architects and master builders. The development and maturing stages of Sinan's career can be illustrated by three major works. The first two of these are in Istanbul: the ≈ûehzade Mosque, which he calls a work of his apprenticeship period and the S√ºleymaniye Mosque, which is the work of his qualification stage. The Selimiye Mosque in Edirne is the product of his master stage.

The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, which is also known as the √úsk√ºdar Quay Mosque, was completed in the same year and has an original design with its main dome supported by three half domes. When Sinan reached the age of 70, he had completed the S√ºleymaniye Mosque complex. This building, situated on one of the hills of Istanbul facing the Golden Horn, and built in the name of S√ºleyman the Magnificent, is one of the symbolic monuments of the period. The diameter of the dome, which exceeds the of the Selimiye Mosque which Sinan completed when he was 80, is the most outstanding example of the level of achievement reached by Sinan. Mimar Sinan reached his artistic peak with the design, architecture, tile decorations and land stone workmanship displayed at Selimiye. Another area of architecture where Sinan produced unique designs are his mausoleums. The Mausoleum of ≈ûehzade Mehmed is notable for with its exterior decorations and sliced dome. The R√ºstem Pa≈üa mausoleum is a very attractive structure in classical style. The mausoleum of S√ºleyman the Magnificent is an interesting experiment, with an octagonal body and flat dome. The Selim II Mausoleum with has a square plan and is one of the best examples of Turkish mausoleum architecture. Sinan's own mausoleum, which is located in the north-east part of the S√ºleymaniye complex on the other hand, is a very plain structure. Sinan masterfully combined art with functionalism in the bridges he built. The largest of these is the nearly long B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece Bridge. Other important examples are the Ailivri Bridge, the Old Bridge in Svilengrad on the Maritsa, the L√ºleburgaz (Sokullu Mehmet Pasha) Bridge on the L√ºleburgaz River, the Sinanlƒ± Bridge over the river Ergene and the Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge over Drina river in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The Drina Bridge gave its name to the famous novel \\"Na Drini ƒáuprija\\" by the Yugoslav author Ivo Andriƒá. While Sinan was maintaining and improving the water supply system of Istanbul, he built arched aqueducts at several locations within the city. The Maƒülova Arch over the Alibey River, which is long and high, has two tiers of arches, and is one of the best examples of its kind. At the start of Sinan's career, Ottoman architecture was highly pragmatic. Buildings were repetitions of former types and were based on rudimentary plans. They were more an assembly of parts than a conception of a whole. An architect could sketch a plan for a new building and an assistant or foreman knew what to do, because novel ideas were avoided. Moreover, architects used an extravagant margin of safety in their designs, resulting in a wasteful use of material and labour. Sinan would gradually change all this. He was to transform established architectural practices, amplifying and transforming the traditions by adding innovations, trying to approach perfection.  The early years (till the mid-1550s) : apprenticeship period  Osman Shah Mosque in Trikala During these years he continued the traditional pattern of Ottoman architecture, but he gradually began exploring other possibilities, because during his military career he had had the opportunity to study the architectural monuments in the conquered cities of Europe and the Middle East. His first opportunity to design a major building was the H√ºsrev Pasha Mosque and its double medresse in Aleppo, Syria. It was built in the winter of 1536-1537 for his commander-in- chief and the governor of Aleppo between two army campaigns. It was built hastily and this is evident in the coarseness of execution and the crude decoration. ·π¢ehzade Mehmed Mosque His first major commission as the royal architect was the construction of the Haseki Sultan Complex for Hurrem Sultan, the wife of the sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. He had to follow the plans drawn by his predecessors. Sinan retained the traditional arrangement of the available space without any innovations. Nevertheless, it was already better built than the Aleppo mosque and it shows a certain elegance. However, it has suffered from many restorations. Sinan is credited to have built a defensive tower in Vlor√´, south Albania, in 1537, very similar to the White Tower of Thessaloniki, as well as Muradie Mosque, during Suleiman the Magnificent's stay in the town for the preparation of his expedition towards Italy. In 1541, he started the construction of the mausoleum (t√ºrbe) of the Grand Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa. It stands on the shore of Be≈üikta≈ü on the European part of Istanbul, at the site where his fleet used to assemble. Oddly enough, the admiral is not buried there, but in his t√ºrbe next to the Iskele mosque. This mausoleum has been severely neglected since then. Mihrimah Sultan, the only daughter of Suleiman and Hurrem and wife of the Grand Vizier R√ºstem Pasha gave Sinan the commission to build a mosque with medrese (college), an imaret (soup kitchen) and a sibyan mekteb (Qur'an school) in √úsk√ºdar. The imaret no longer exists. This Iskele Mosque (or Jetty mosque) already shows several hallmarks of Sinan's mature style: a spacious, high-vaulted basement, slender minarets, single-domed baldacchino, flanked by three semi-domes ending in three exedrae and a broad double portico. The construction was finished in 1548. The construction of a double portico was not a first in Ottoman architecture, but it set a trend for country mosques and mosques of viziers in particular. R√ºstem Pasha and Mihrimah required them later in their three mosques in Constantinople and in the R√ºstem Pasha Mosque in Tekirdaƒü. The inner portico traditionally have stalactite capitals while the outer portico has capitals with chevron patterns (baklava). When sultan Suleiman the Magnificent returned from another Balkan campaign, he received news that his son ·π¢ehzade Mehmed had died at the age of twenty-two. In November 1543, not long after Sinan had started the construction of the Iskele Mosque, the sultan ordered Sinan to build a new major mosque with an adjoining complex in memory of his favourite son. This ≈ûehzade Mosque would become larger and more ambitious than his previous ones. Architectural historians consider this mosque as Sinan's first masterpiece. Obsessed by the concept of a large central dome, Sinan turned to the plans of mosques such as the Fatih Pasha Mosque in Diyarbakƒ±r or the Piri Pasha Mosque in Hask√∂y. He must have visited both mosques during his Persian campaign. Sinan built a mosque with a central dome, this time with four equal half-domes. This superstructure is supported by four massive, but still elegant, free-standing octagonal fluted piers and four piers incorporated in each lateral wall. In the corners, above roof level, four turrets serve as stabilizing anchors. This coherent concept already is markedly different from the additive plans of traditional Ottoman architecture. Sedefkar Mehmed Agha would later copy the concept of fluted piers in his Sultan Ahmed Mosque in an attempt to lighten their appearance. Sinan, however, rejected this solution in his next mosques.  Mid-1550s to 1570: qualification stage  By 1550, Suleiman the Magnificent was at the height of his powers. Having built a mosque for his son, he felt it was time to construct his own imperial mosque, an enduring monument larger than all the others, to be built on a gently sloping hillside dominating the Golden Horn. Money was no problem, since he had accumulated a treasure from the loot of his campaigns in Europe and the Middle East. He gave the order to Sinan to build a mosque, the S√ºleymaniye, surrounded by a k√ºlliye consisting of four colleges, a soup kitchen, a hospital, an asylum, a hamam, a caravanserai and a hospice for travellers (tabhane). Sinan, now heading a formidable department with a great number of assistants, finished this formidable task in seven years. Before S√ºleymaniye, no mosques had been built with half cubic roofs. He got the idea of half cubic roof design from the Hagia Sophia. Through this monumental achievement, Sinan emerged from the anonymity of his predecessors. Sinan must have known the ideas of the Renaissance architect Leone Battista Alberti (who in turn had studied De architectura by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius), since he too was concerned in building the ideal church, reflecting harmony through the perfection of geometry in architecture. But, contrary to his Western counterparts, Sinan was more interested in simplification than in enrichment. He tried to achieve the largest volume under a single central dome. The dome is based on the circle, the perfect geometrical figure representing, in an abstract way, a perfect God. Sinan used subtle geometric relationships, using multiples of two when calculating the ratios and the proportions of his buildings. However, in a later stage, he also used divisions of three or ratios of two to three when working out the width and the proportions of domes, such as the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque at Kadƒ±rga. While he was fully occupied with the construction of the S√ºleymaniye, Sinan or his subordinates drew up the plans and gave instructions for many other constructions. Sinan built a mosque for the Grand Vizier Pargalƒ± ƒ∞brahim Pasha and a mausoleum (t√ºrbe) at Silivrikapƒ± (Constantinople) in 1551. Juma-Jami Mosque (Han Mosque), Yevpatoria, Crimea The next Grand Vizier, R√ºstem Pasha gave Sinan several more commissions. In 1550 he built a large inn (han) in the Galata district of Istanbul. About ten years later he built another han in Edirne, and between 1544 and 1561 the Ta·π£ Han at Erzurum. He designed a caravanserai in Eregli and an octagonal madrasah in Constantinople. Between 1553 and 1555, Sinan built the Sinan Pasha Mosque at Be≈üikta≈ü, a smaller version of the √ú√ß ≈ûerefeli Mosque at Edirne, for the Grand Admiral Sinan Pasha. This proves again that Sinan had thoroughly studied the work of other architects, especially since he was responsible for the upkeep of these buildings. He copied the old form, pondered over the weaknesses in the construction and tried to solve this with his own solution. In 1554, Sinan used the form of the Sinan Pasha mosque again for the construction of the mosque for the next Grand Vizier Kara Ahmet Pasha in Constantinople, his first hexagonal mosque. By using a hexagonal plan, Sinan could reduce the side domes to half-domes and set them in the corners at an angle of 45 degrees. Clearly, Sinan must have appreciated this form, since he repeated it later in mosques such as the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque at Kadƒ±rga and the Atik Valide Mosque at √úsk√ºdar. In 1556, Sinan built the Haseki H√ºrrem Sultan Hamamƒ±, replacing the antique Baths of Zeuxippus, which are still standing close to the Hagia Sophia. This would become one of the most beautiful hamams he ever constructed. In 1559, he built the Cafer Aƒüa madrasah below the forecourt of the Hagia Sophia. In the same year he began the construction of a small mosque for Iskender Pasha at Kanlƒ±ka, beside the Bosphorus. This was one of the many minor and routine commissions the office of Sinan received over the years. Possibly Mimar Sinan (left) at the tomb of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1566 In 1561, when R√ºstem Pasha died, Sinan began the construction of the R√ºstem Pasha Mosque, as a memorial supervised by his widow Mihrimah Sultan. It is situated just below the S√ºleymaniye. This time the central form is octagonal, modelled on the monastery church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, with four small semi-domes set in the corners. In the same year, Sinan built a t√ºrbe for R√ºstem Pasha in the garden of the ≈ûehzade Mosque, decorated with the finest tiles Iznik could produce. Mihrimah Sultan, having doubled her wealth after the death of her husband, now wanted a mosque of her own. Sinan built the Mihrimah Mosque at Edirnekapƒ± (Edirne Gate) for her on the highest of the seven hills of Constantinople. He raised the mosque on a vaulted platform, accentuating its hilltop site. There is some speculation concerning the dates; until recently this was supposed to be between 1540 and 1540, but now it is generally accepted to be between 1562 and 1565. Sinan, concerned with grandeur, built a mosque in one of his most imaginative designs, using new support systems and lateral spaces to increase the area available for windows. He built a central dome high and wide, supported by pendentives, on a square base with two lateral galleries, each with three cupolas. At each corner of this square stands a gigantic pier, connected with immense arches each with 15 large windows and four circular ones, flooding the interior with light. The style of this revolutionary building was as close to the Gothic style as Ottoman structure permits. In 1566 Sinan completed the Banya Bashi Mosque in Sofia, Bulgaria, currently the only functioning mosque in the city. His first mosque in Sofia was built in 1528; popularly known as Imaret Mosque or Black Mosque due to the dark colour of its building stone, it was damaged by an earthquake and abandoned in the XIX century. In the 1560s he built the Kirkcesme water supply system for Istanbul. It is seen as a masterpiece of his work. It spans 55 km and includes 35 aqueduct bridges, 4 of which are notable for their height (up to 35m) as well as their length (up to 700m). Between 1560 and 1566 Sinan built a mosque in Constantinople for Zal Mahmud Pasha on a hillside beyond Ayvansaray. Sinan certainly conceived the plans and partly supervised the construction, but left the building of lesser areas to less than competent hands, since Sinan and his most able assistants were about to begin his masterpiece, the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. On the outside, the mosque rises high, with its east wall pierced by four tiers of windows. This gives the mosque an aspect of a palace or even a block of apartments. Inside, there are three broad galleries making the interior look compact. The heaviness of this structure makes the dome look unexpectedly lofty. These galleries look like a preliminary try-out for the galleries of the Selimiye Mosque.  The period from 1570 to his death: master stage  Selimiye Mosque, built by Sinan in 1575. Edirne, Turkey. Selimiye Mosque detail. In this late stage of his life, Sinan tried to create unified and sublimely elegant interiors. To achieve this, he eliminated all the unnecessary subsidiary spaces beyond the supporting piers of the central dome. This can be seen in the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque in Kadƒ±rga, Istanbul (1571‚Äì1572) and in the Selimiye mosque in Edirne. In other buildings of his final period, Sinan experimented with spatial and mural treatments that were new in the classical Ottoman architecture. According to him from his autobiography \\"Tezkiret√º‚Äôl B√ºnyan\\", his masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. Breaking free of the handicaps of traditional Ottoman architecture, this mosque marks the climax of Sinan's work and of all classical Ottoman architecture. While it was being built, the architect's saying of \\"You can never build a dome larger than the dome of Hagia Sophia and specially as Muslims\\" was his main motivation. When it was completed, Sinan claimed that it had the largest dome in the world, leaving Hagia Sophia behind. In fact, the dome height from the ground level was lower and the diameter barely larger (0.5 meters, approximately 2 feet) than the millennium-older Hagia Sophia. However, measured from its base the dome of Selimiye is higher. Sinan was more than 80 years old when the building was finished. In this mosque he finally realized his aim of creating the optimum, completely unified, domed interior : a triumph of space that dominates the interior. He used this time an octagonal central dome (31.28 m wide and 42 m high), supported by eight elephantine piers of marble and granite. These supports lack any capitals but have squinches or consoles at their summit, leading to the optical effect that the arches seem to grow integrally out of the piers. By placing the lateral galleries far away, he increased the three-dimensional effect. The many windows in the screen walls flood the interior with light. The buttressing semi-domes are set in the four corners of the square under the dome. The weight and the internal tensions are hidden, producing an airy and elegant effect rarely seen under a central dome. The four minarets (83 m high) at the corners of the prayer hall are the tallest in the Muslim world, accentuating the vertical posture of this mosque that already dominates the city.

Conclusion  Mimar Sinan's architectural concepts were incorporated into the design of the famous Taj Mahal.,William J. Hennessey, PhD, Director, Univ. of Michigan Museum of Art. IBM 1999 WORLD BOOK.Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman. Architecture: from Prehistory to Post-Modernism. p. 223. in the Mughal Empire by Shah Jahan. At the start of his career as an architect, Sinan had to deal with an established, traditional domed architecture. His training as an army engineer led him to approach architecture from an empirical point of view, rather than from a theoretical one. He started to experiment with the design and engineering of single-domed and multiple-domed structures. He tried to obtain a new geometrical purity, a rationality and a spatial integrity in his structures and designs of mosques. Through all this, he demonstrated his creativity and his wish to create a clear, unified space. He started to develop a series of variations on the domes, surrounding them in different ways with semi-domes, piers, screen walls and different sets of galleries. His domes and arches are curved, but he avoided curvilinear elements in the rest of his design, transforming the circle of the dome into a rectangular, hexagonal or octagonal system. He tried to obtain a rational harmony between the exterior pyramidal composition of semi-domes, culminating in a single drumless dome, and the interior space where this central dome vertically integrates the space into a unified whole. His genius lies in the organization of this space and in the resolution of the tensions created by the design. He was an innovator in the use of decoration and motifs, merging them into the architectural forms as a whole. He accentuated the centre underneath the central dome by flooding it with light from the many windows. He incorporated his mosques in an efficient way into a complex (k√ºlliye), serving the needs of the community as an intellectual centre, a community centre and serving the social needs and the health problems of the faithful. When Sinan died, classical Ottoman architecture had reached its climax. No successor was gifted enough to better the design of the Selimiye mosque and to develop it further. His students retreated to earlier models, such as the ≈ûehzade mosque. Invention faded away, and a decline set in. Constructions During his tenure during 50 years of the post of imperial architect, Sinan is said to have constructed or supervised 476 buildings (196 of which still survive), according to the official list of his works, the Tazkirat-al-Abniya. He could not possibly have designed them all, but he relied on the skills of his office. He took credit and the responsibility for their work. For, as a janissary, and thus a slave of the sultan, his primary responsibility was to the sultan. In his spare time, he also designed buildings for the chief officials. He delegated to his assistants the construction of less important buildings in the provinces. *94 large mosques (camii), *57 colleges, *52 smaller mosques (mescit), *48 bath-houses (hamam). *35 palaces (saray), *22 mausoleums (t√ºrbe), *20 caravanserai (kervansaray; han), *17 public kitchens (imaret), *8 bridges, *8 store houses or granaries *7 Koranic schools (medrese), *6 aqueducts, *3 hospitals (dar√º≈ü≈üifa) Some of his works: Banya Bashi Mosque in Sofia * Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Azapkapƒ±) * Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Kadƒ±rga) * Caferaƒüa Medresseh * Selimiye Mosque in Edirne * S√ºleymaniye Mosque * Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha Complex * Molla √áelebi Mosque * Haseki Baths * Haseki Sultan Complex * √áemberlita≈ü Baths * Piyale Pasha Mosque * ≈ûehzade Mosque * Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in Edirnekapƒ± * Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in √úsk√ºdar * Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge in Vi≈°egrad * Banya Bashi Mosque in Sofia, Bulgaria * Nisanci Mehmed Pasha Mosque * R√ºstem Pasha Mosque * Zal Mahmud Pasha Mosque * Kadirga Sokullu Mosque * Koursoum Mosque or Osman Shah Mosque in Trikala * Al-Takiya Al-Suleimaniya in Damascus * Yavuz Sultan Selim Madras * Mimar Sinan Bridge in B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece * Church of the Assumption in Uzundzhovo * Tekkiye Mosque * Khusruwiyah Mosque * Oratory at the Western Wall  Death and Legacy  Sinan's octagonal water dispenser on the left next to his tomb behind the iron grill on the right, Fatih district of Istanbul Sinan and the Selimiye Mosque on the reverse of the Turkish 10,000 lira banknote of 1982-1995 Sinan died in AH 996 (1587-88 CE) and is buried in a tomb in Istanbul, a t√ºrbe of his own design, just to the north of the S√ºleymaniye Mosque, across a street named Mimar Sinan Caddesi in his honour.

Some of the school's more notable pupils include Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Lillian Powell, Charles Weidman, Jack Cole, and silent film star Louise Brooks. The school was especially renowned for its influence on ballet and experimental modern dance. In time, Denishawn teachings reached another school location as well - Studio 61 at the Carnegie Hall Studios. Beginnings Initially solo artists, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn began collaborating on work in 1914. At the time, St. Denis was preparing for a tour of the southeastern region of the United States, and needed a male partner to help present new ballroom dances. Shawn, who had admired St. Denis since seeing her perform in 1911, auditioned for and was awarded the role. The resulting tour featured the partnered pieces along with individual works from St. Denis and Shawn respectively. Eventually, the working relationship between Shawn and St. Denis turned romantic. The two artists fell in love and, lovers living together being considered unorthodox at this point in history, were married on August 13, 1914. Denis, reticent about marriage, had the word \\"obey\\" deleted from their wedding vows and declined to wear a wedding ring. Their \\"honeymoon\\" consisted of a second joint tour - accompanied by a small company of dancers - from Saratoga, New York to San Francisco, California. A new collection of dances, including more ballroom variations, St. Denis' solos and Shawn's famous Dagger Dance, was showcased. For promotional purposes, the dancing group was referred to as the St. Denis-Shawn Company. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, the two established their first official school, the Ruth St. Denis School of Dancing and Its Related Arts, in the summer of 1915. It was not until February 6, 1915, on yet another tour, that the term \\"Denishawn\\" actually surfaced. At a performance in Portland, Oregon, a theater manager promised eight box seats to whoever could dream up the most creative name for the latest St. Denis-Shawn ballroom exhibition. The unchallenged, winning title was \\"The Denishawn Rose Mazurka.\\" While the name as a whole did n0t warrant much popularity, the \\"Denishawn\\" portion attracted audience members and the press - to such an extent that the namesake couple chose to officially change their company name from the St. Denis-Shawn Company to Denishawn Dancers. With this new name and a school of their own, Shawn and St. Denis began brainstorming ways to expand their contributions to the dance world. St. Denis and Shawn renamed the school officially under the title 'The Denishawn School', and they soon began developing those movements, techniques, and innovations that are known today as the Denishawn style of dancing. The two developed a guide for their pedagogy and choreography, an excerpt of which is quoted below: > \\"The art of dance is too big to be encompassed by any one system. On the > contrary, the dance includes all systems or schools of dance. Every way that > any human being of any race or nationality, at any period of human history, > has moved rhythmically to express himself, belongs to the dance. We endeavor > to recognize and use all contributions of the past to the dance and will > continue to use all new contributions in the future\\". Later years Denishawn officially disintegrated in 1931 after Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis separated in their marriage, though the pair never divorced and continued to promote dance education through their respective endeavors. Shawn went on to purchase the property used for the Jacob's Pillow Dance center in Lee, Massachusetts, which continues to operate. In her teachings after Denishawn, St. Denis focused on spiritual and Asian influences in dance. After roughly a decade working apart, Shawn and St. Denis reunited briefly in 1941 at the Jacob's Pillow Dance festival, where they performed several works together. Technique and classes Over the years that the school grew more widely renown, the teaching system was constantly being evolved. According to St. Denis, Shawn attributed the most to this. He addressed incoming students with a 'diagnosis lesson', which would assess their current skills in order to assign them to a specific learning/class structure for their time at the Denishawn school. Shawn also was firm on his ideas of what was necessary for the learning curriculum. He addressed that ballet was an overall necessity for any dancer to move forward or thrive in their studies, which is a big reason why the Denishawn curriculum was largely based on ballet fundamentals. When taking technique classes, students danced in bare feet and wore identical one- piece black wool bathing suits. Classes lasted three hours every morning. Shawn typically taught during the first block of time, leading students through stretches, limbering exercises, ballet barre and floor progressions and free-form center combinations. St. Denis then took over with instruction in Oriental and yoga techniques. Author and former Denishawn pupil Jane Sherman recalls an everyday class, laden with ballet terminology: > \\"A typical Denishawn class began at the barre; first came stretching, petits > and grands battements, a series of plies in the five positions, sixteen > measures of grande rondes de jambes, and thirty-two measures of petites > rondes de jambes. These might be followed by slow releves in arabesque, fast > changes, entrechats, and exercises to prepare for fouettes. In short, the > works! After ballet arm exercises out on the floor, we next worked to > perfect our develops en tournant, out attitudes, out renverses, and our > grande jetes\\". Each pupil danced alone a series of pas de basques: the Denishawn version, the ballet, the Spanish, and the Hungarian. The Denishawn pas de basque was distinguished by arms held high and parallel overhead as the body made an extreme arch sideways toward the leading foot. Next usually came a free, open exercise affectionately nicknamed \\"arms and body,\\" done to a waltz from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty. A forerunner of the technical warmups now used in many modern dance schools, it started with feet placed far apart and pressed flat on the floor. After a slow swinging of the body into ever- increasing circles, came head, shoulder, and torso rolls, with the arms sweeping from the floor to the ceiling followed by a relaxed run around the circumference of the studio, ending in a back fall. Other exercises included Javanese arm movements, and hand stretches to train the dancers Western fingers into going backward into some semblance of Cambodian dance flexibility. Class always closed with the learning of another part of a dance. Based on the theory that one learns to perform by performing, dance exercises were essential elements in Denishawn training, and some of them were so professionally interesting that they became part of the concert repertory. Any pupil attending classes at a Denishawn school had a wide array of classes to choose from outside of the consistent technique classes. Ted felt it important that the technique was not all too rigid, like classical ballet, and contained some less-structured forms, which brought classes on Dalcroze eurythmics as well as Delsarte laws of expressionism into the curricula. Ruth, on the other hand, emphasized the origins of dance from the foreign countries of the East, the history behind these techniques, and the method of what she called \\"music visualization\\", and added to the curricula based on these standards. The couple also offered a Hawaiian Hula class taught by the dance instructor Kulamanu, as well as a class taught by Misha Ito that emphasized specificities of the technique to Japanese sword dancing. Outside of movement classes, the school had lectures, music classes, the art of dyeing and the treatment of fabrics, and libraries to study for these courses.  Schools opened  The first school that St. Denis and Shawn opened as partners was an older Spanish- style mansion in the hills of Los Angeles on St. Paul Street. It had an indoor room that was perfectly sized to fit smaller classes, a swimming pool and a tennis court for additional endurance training and/or leisure time, and the estate was filled with eucalyptus trees. Once they settled in, they built their own dancing platform over the tennis court. They also strategically built canopies over the outside space so that they could use it year-round. There were two spaces in the St. Paul school reserved for technique classes: an indoor studio where St. Denis primarily taught, and an outdoor ballroom for yoga meditations and Shawn's various classes (ballet, ballroom and what would later be called \\"Denishawn\\" technique). $500 covered the cost of a 12-week program that included daily technique classes, room and board, arts and crafts and guided reading lessons. Regular classes and a lunch at the school would cost one dollar for the students. The fees would be collected in an old cigar box by one of Shawn's friends, Mary Jane Sizemore. During the second summer that the school was opened St. Denis and Shawn decided to hire a manager. Mrs. Edwina Hamilton was brought on staff at the school and was praised by Ruth for her kindness. That winter St. Denis and Shawn went on tour and left the school open and in the hands of Mrs. Hamilton and the assistant teachers. While they were on tour, the registration for upcoming classes looked promising and Mrs. Hamilton suggested that the Denishawn School find a bigger home. Their second school location in Los Angeles was in an old house in West Lake Park and shared similar characteristics to the St. Paul Street estate. This location had a garden and a tennis court, like the previous school had. Another dance platform was built over the tennis court, a tent was placed over that, and an auditorium was positioned on one side of the area and a dressing room on the opposite side. Eventually, the school went on to spreading farther than just California as Shawn and St. Denis spread their repertory and style through performing. In 1927 they opened a school on Stevenson Place in The Bronx, New York.http://www.denishawncentennial.com/Denishawn_House.html Repertory and performance Ruth St Denis & Company The Denishawn Dancers took advantage of many performance opportunities ‚Äì in colleges, concert halls, vaudeville theaters, convention centers and outdoor stadiums. Besides being invited to performance venues like New York's Palace Theater (1916), Denishawn was the first American company to present \\"serious Western dance\\" in Japan, Burma, China, India, Ceylon, Java, Malaya and the Philippines (1925‚Äì26) In some ways, the presented work resembled ballet ‚Äì each piece was a full-company story with elaborate costumes, sets and lighting. In terms of movement, however, the differences were obvious ‚Äì no pointe shoes, no pas de deux lifts, no exact format for patterning solos and ensemble pieces. Most Denishawn works fall into one of four categories: *Orientalia: Chronologically, these were the first true Denishawn works. St. Denis was responsible for the majority of these pieces, though Shawn did put together a small number of Oriental solos and group dances. As their title suggests, these pieces incorporate aspects of East Indian movement, dress and environment (in the form of set design). A particularly famous work from this period is St. Denis's Radha, a mini-ballet set in a Hindu temple in which an exotic woman dances to honor the five senses. *Americana: While St. Denis found her most powerful inspiration in the Far East, Shawn seemed to find his in the cultures of America. His works dominate the Americana series, complete with musical scores by American composers and portrayals of \\"American\\" characters like cowboys, Indians and ballplayers. Shawn's comic pantomime Danse Americaine, for example, centers on a soft-shoe dancer acting as a baseball player. *Music visualizations: Inspired by Isadora Duncan's approach to music, St. Denis developed the music visualization, which she defined as \\"...the scientific translation into bodily action of the rhythmic, melodic and harmonious structure of a musical composition without intention to in any way 'interpret' or reveal any hidden meaning apprehended by the dancer\\". Meaning, movement was set strictly to music without reading into anything emotionally. If the music swells, the body swells: if the music grows quiet, the body comes to rest. St. Denis's Soaring, set on five female dancers, is arguably her most well-known music visualization. *Miscellanea: Also known as \\"Denishawn divertissements\\", these shorter works included those that cannot fit neatly into the pigeonholes of \\"Oriental\\", \\"Americana\\" and \\"Music Visualization\\". These works were reserved for performances that did not require presentations of full-length ballets. Many Denishawn solo works remain in the active repertoire of many companies. Their solos are of special interest to many for their exotic qualities. Several of their solos were included in \\"The Art of the Solo\\" presented at the Baltimore Museum of Art on September 29, 2006. These included three revival premieres, namely, Shawn's \\"Invocation to the Thunderbird\\"(1916), last danced by Denishawn dancer John Dougherty and \\"Death of Adonis\\" (1922). Both were recreated by Mino Nicolas, programme curator, with the aid of film, written accounts and photographs. Also featured were the revival premiere of Ruth St. Denis' \\"The Peacock/A Legend of India\\" (1906) which was recreated using the same methods. Her signature solo, \\"The Incense\\", will also be performed by Cynthia Word of Washington, D.C.  Pupils  During its developmental years, the first pupils to join the Denishawn school played a large role in building it up from the ground, and have even been described as \\"foundation stones of the system that was to spread over the country\\". This group included Margaret Loomis, Addie Munn, Helen Eisner, Florine Goodman, Aileen Flaven, Florence Andrews (who danced under the name Florence O'Denishawn, Sadie Vanderhoff, Carol Dempster, Ada Forman, Claire Niles, Chula Monzon, and Yvonne Sinnard. The majority of these original dancers were related to close acquaintances of St.Denis and Shawn. Another well known student and employee of the Denishawn school was Pearl Wheeler. She was primarily the costumer for the school but also took classes and appeared in performances alongside the other dancers. Several notable movie stars of the early 20th century studied under the Denishawn school in their lifetimes. The Gish sisters, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, took classes from St. Denis and Shawn for some time. Lillian even worked separately with St. Denis and Ruth when she and Rosie Dolly learned a dance from the two that was to be featured in their upcoming movie, The Lily and the Rose (1915). Other notable movie stars of the time include: Louise Brooks, Ina Claire, Ruth Chatterton, Lenore Ulric, Mabel Normand, Florence Vidor, Colleen Moore, and Myrna Loy. Some pupils who had their beginnings in the Denishawn school went on to make names for themselves , and their presence at the school is sometimes overlooked in their history. For instance, 'Mother of Modern Dance' Martha Graham joined the school during its second summer. She remained there for over a half decade, learning the technique and eventually becoming a regular instructor. Ruth claimed that during her time there, she was \\"quiet but asked intelligent questions.\\" Another two pupils who came to Denishawn in their early careers were Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman. Humphrey moved out to California from Evanston, Illinois so that she could have the opportunity to study at the Denishawn school. St. Denis eventually told Humphrey that she should reconsider her plans to become a teacher and pursue a career in performing first. After some time studying at the school's West Lake Park, Humphrey and Weidman migrated to New York where they managed Denishawn's NY-based Denishawn house to develop their own styles and, eventually, open their own school: the Humphrey-Weidman Dance Company.Cohen, Selma Jean; Dance Perspectives Foundation.

Another illustrious Denishawn School (and company) alumnus was the jazz-dance innovator and choreographer Jack Cole. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195173697.001.0001/acref-9780195173697-e-0485?rskey=HM8Hfk&result;=487 See also *Modern dance *20th century concert dance *Martha Graham * Charles Weidman * Doris Humphrey * Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers * Marion Rice * Music Visualization References Further reading *Suzanne Shelton, Divine Dancer: A Biography of Ruth St. Denis (New York: Doubleday, 1981) *Jane Sherman, Denishawn: The Enduring Influence (Boston, MA: Twayne Publishers, 1983) *Jane Sherman, The Drama of Denishawn Dance (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1979) Category:Dance schools in the United States Category:Dance in California Category:Modern dance Category:Martha Graham Category:1915 establishments in California Category:Educational institutions established in 1915 ","title":"Denishawn school"},{"id":"561883","text":"Ettrick & Lauderdale, 1975-96 Ettrick and Lauderdale (Eadaraig agus Srath Labhdair in Scottish Gaelic) was one of four local government districts in the Borders region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996.

It is a plant pathogen and part of a cryptic species complex of closely related and morphologically similar species. It causes Armillaria root rot in many plant species and produces mushrooms around the base of trees it has infected. The symptoms of infection appear in the crowns of infected trees as discoloured foliage, reduced growth, dieback of the branches and death. The mushrooms are edible but some people may be intolerant to them. This species is capable of producing light via bioluminescence in its mycelium. Armillaria mellea is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The fruit body or mushroom, commonly known as stump mushroom, stumpie, honey mushroom, pipinky or pinky, grows typically on hardwoods but may be found around and on other living and dead wood or in open areas. Taxonomy The species was originally named Agaricus melleus by Danish-Norwegian botanist Martin Vahl in 1790; it was transferred to the genus Armillaria in 1871 by Paul Kummer.

The margins of the cap are often arched at maturity and the surface is sticky when wet. Though typically honey-coloured, this fungus is rather variable in appearance and sometimes has a few dark, hairy scales near the centre somewhat radially arranged. The gills are white at first, sometimes becoming pinkish-yellow or discoloured with age, broad and fairly distant, attached to the stipe at right angles or are slightly decurrent. The spore print is white. The stipe is of variable length, up to about long and in diameter. It is fibrillose and of a firm spongy consistency at first but later becomes hollow. It is cylindrical and tapers to a point at its base where it is fused to the stipes of other mushrooms in the clump. It is whitish at the upper end and brownish-yellow below, often with a very dark-coloured base. There is a broad persistent skin- like ring attached to the upper part of the stipe. This has a velvety margin and yellowish fluff underneath and extends outwards as a white partial veil protecting the gills when young. The flesh of the cap is whitish and has a sweetish odour and flavour with a tinge of bitterness. Under the microscope, the spores are approximately elliptical, 7‚Äì9 by 6‚Äì7 ¬µm, inamyloid with prominent apiculi (short, pointed projections) at the base. The basidia (spore-producing structures) lack basal clamps. The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. They are bundled together in rhizomorphs that are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia are luminous when in active growth. Similar species Armillaria mellea once included a range of species with similar features that have since been reclassified. Distribution Armillaria mellea is widespread in northern temperate zones. It has been found in North America, Europe and northern Asia, and It has been introduced to South Africa. The fungus grows parasitically on a large number of broadleaf trees. It fruits in dense clusters at the base of trunks or stumps. Ecology Picked honey fungus. Ukraine Trees become infected by Armillaria mellea when rhizomorphs growing through the soil encounter uninfected roots. Alternatively, when infected roots come into contact with uninfected ones the fungal mycelium may grow across. The rhizomorphs invade the trunk, growing between the bark and the wood and causing wood decay, growth reduction and mortality. Trees that are already under stress are more likely to be attacked but healthy trees may also be parasitized. The foliage becomes sparse and discoloured, twig growth slows down and branches may die back. When they are attacked, the Douglas-fir, western larch and some other conifers often produce an extra large crop of cones shortly before dying. Coniferous trees also tend to ooze resin from infected areas whereas broad- leaved trees sometimes develop sunken cankers. A growth of fruiting bodies near the base of the trunk confirms the suspicion of Armillaria root rot. In 1893, the American mycologist Charles Horton Peck reported finding Armillaria fruiting bodies that were \\"aborted\\", in a similar way to specimens of Entoloma abortivum. It was not until 1974 that Roy Watling showed that the aborted specimens included cells of both Armillaria mellea and Entoloma abortivum. He thought that the Armillaria was parasitizing the Entoloma, a plausible hypothesis given its pathogenic behaviour. However, a 2001 study by Czederpiltz, Volk and Burdsall showed that the Entoloma was in fact the microparasite. The whitish-grey malformed fruit bodies known as carpophoroids were the result of E. abortivum hyphae penetrating the Armillaria and disrupting its normal development. The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. The rhizomorphs of A. mellea are initiated from mycelium into multicellular apices of rhizomorphs, which are multicellular vegetative organs that exclude soil from the interior of the rhizomorph tissues. The rhizomorphs spread through far greater distances through the ground than the mycelium. The rhizomorphs are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia and rhizomorphs are luminous when in active growth. A. mellea producing rhizomorphs is parasitic on woody plants of many species, including especially shrubs, hardwood and evergreen trees. In one example, A. mellea spread by rhizomorphs from an initially infected tree killed 600 trees in a prune orchard in 6 years. Each infected tree was immediately adjacent to an already infected one, the spread by rhizomorphs through the tree roots and soil. (Piper and Fletcher, 1903, Wash. Age. Exp. Sat. But., 59: 1-14); cited in Rhizomorph Development in A. mellea, Ph.D. thesis, by Philip Snider(1957), Farlow Herbarium Library Harvard Univ., 20 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, Mass. Edibility Parboiling honey fungus. Armillaria mellea mushroom are considered good edibles, although some individuals have reported \\"allergic\\" reactions that result in stomach upsets. Some authors suggest not collecting mushrooms from the wood of various trees, including hemlock, buckeye, eucalyptus, and locust. The mushrooms have a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and nutty, with a texture ranging from chewy to crunchy, depending on the method of preparation. Parboiling mushrooms before consuming removes the bitter taste present in some specimens, and may reduce the amount of gastrointestinal irritants. According to one guide, they must be cooked before eating. Drying the mushrooms preserves and intensifies their flavour, although reconstituted mushrooms tend to be tough to eat. The mushrooms can also be pickled and roasted. Chemistry Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies. The triterpenes 3Œ≤-hydroxyglutin-5-ene, friedelane-2Œ±,3Œ≤-diol, and friedelin were reported in 2011. Indole compounds include tryptamine, L-tryptophan and serotonin. The fungus produces cytotoxic compounds known as melleolides. Melleolides are made from orsellinic acid and protoilludane sesquiterpene alcohols via esterification. A polyketide synthase gene, termed ArmB, was identified in the genome of the fungus, which was found expressed during melleolide production. The gene shares ca. 42% similarity with the orsellinic acid synthase gene (OrsA) in Aspergillus nidulans. Characterization of the gene proved it to catalyze orsillinic acid in vitro. It is a non-reducing iterative type 1 polyketide synthase. Co-incubation of free orsellinic acid with alcohols and ArmB showed cross-coupling activity. Therefore, the enzyme has transesterification activity. Also, there are other auxiliary factors suspected to control substrate specificity.Lackner et al., 2013 Additionally, halogen modifications have been observed. Overexpression of annotated halogenases (termed ArmH1-5) and characterization of the subsequent enzymes revealed in all five enzymes the chlorination of mellolide F. In vitro reactions of free standing substrates showed that the enzymes do not require auxiliary carrier proteins for substrate delivery.Wick et al., 2015 See also *Forest pathology *List of Armillaria species *List of bioluminescent fungi References  External links  Category:Bioluminescent fungi mellea Category:Fungi described in 1790 Category:Fungi of Africa Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America Category:Parasitic fungi Category:Fungal grape diseases Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases ","title":"Armillaria mellea"},{"id":"561887","text":"Jacques Loussier (26 October 1934 ‚Äì 5 March 2019) was a French pianist and composer. He arranged jazz interpretations of many of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as the Goldberg Variations. The Jacques Loussier Trio, founded in 1959, played more than 3,000 concerts and sold more than 7 million recordings‚Äîmostly in the Bach series. Loussier composed film scores and a number of classical pieces, including a Mass, a ballet, and violin concertos. Loussier's style is described as third stream, a synthesis of jazz and classical music, with an emphasis on improvisation.  Early life  Loussier was born on 26 October 1934 in Angers, France. He started piano lessons there aged ten. When he was eleven, he heard a piece from the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. In a 2003 interview, he said \\"I was studying this piece and I just fell in love with it. Then I found I loved to play the music, but add my own notes, expanding the harmonies and playing around with that music.\\" At 13, he met the pianist Yves Nat in Paris, who regularly gave him projects for three months, after which he returned for another lesson.  Career  Loussier began composing music while studying at the Conservatoire National Musique, having moved by then to Paris, with Nat, from the age of 16. At a competition at the conservatory, he played a prelude by Bach, and when his memory failed, improvised. He later said that he only followed a tradition, because musicians of the 18th century were great improvisers, Bach among them. Loussier played jazz in Paris bars to finance his studies. Fusing Bach and jazz was unique at the time. After six years of studies, Loussier traveled to the Middle East and Latin America, where he was inspired by different sounds. He stayed in Cuba for a year. Early in his career, Loussier was an accompanist for the singers Frank Alamo, Charles Aznavour, L√©o Ferr√© and Catherine Sauvage. In 1959, he formed the Jacques Loussier Trio with string bass player Pierre Michelot‚Äîwho had played with Django Reinhardt and the Quintette du Hot Club de France‚Äîand percussionist Christian Garros. They used Bach's compositions as a base for jazz improvisation and made many live appearances, tours, and concerts, as well as a number of recordings. The trio began with Decca Records but changed to Philips/Phonogram in 1973. They sold over six million albums in 15 years. Their best known recording is \\"Air on the G String\\", which was used to advertise the Hamlet brand of cigar in the UK for over 30 years. In the mid 1970s, the trio was dissolved. Loussier set up his own recording studio, Studio Miraval, which opened in 1977, where he worked on compositions for acoustic and electric instruments. He recorded with musicians such as Pink Floyd, Elton John, Sting, Chris Rea, and Sade. Parts of Pink Floyd's album The Wall were recorded at his studio. In 1985, the tricentenary of Bach's birth, Loussier revived the trio with the percussionist Andr√© Arpino and the bassist Vincent Charbonnier. The bassist Benoit Dunoyer de Segonzac has also performed in the trio, replacing Charbonnier‚Äîwhose left hand was affected by a stroke, resulting in his being unable to continue to play the bass‚Äîon a number of albums and concerts from at least as early as 1998 (on the album Satie: Gymnop√©dies Gnossiennes). Besides Bach, the trio recorded interpretations of compositions by Handel, Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Satie, Debussy, Ravel, and Schumann. A 2005 recording titled Take Bach, made by the trio along with the Pekinel sisters, features adaptations of Bach's concertos for two and three pianos. Loussier's last albums, My Personal Favorites and Beyond Bach, Other Composers I Adore, were released in 2014, on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Loussier in 2008 In March 2002, Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against rapper Eminem and The Marshall Mathers LP executive producer Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for the track \\"Kill You\\" was stolen from his composition Pulsion. He demanded that all sales of the album be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was settled out of court.  Death  Loussier suffered a stroke during a performance at the Klavier-Festival Ruhr on 14 July 2011, and retired from the stage. He died on 5 March 2019 at the age of 84.  Compositions  Loussier composed the music for over 100 films, made for cinema and television series, beginning with The Happy Sixties in 1963. These included the scores for the films Heaven on One's Head (1965), Living It Up (1966), The Killing Game (1967), Dark of the Sun (1968), Monique (1970) and The Man Who Went Up in Smoke (1980), the theme tune for the popular 1960s French TV series Thierry la Fronde, and the original sign-on music for La 3e cha√Æne, the predecessor television channel to France 3. Loussier also composed a trumpet concerto, two violin concertos, and music for a ballet, among other pieces. His Mass, Lumi√®res: Messe Baroque du 21e Si√®cle (Lights: A Baroque Mass of the 21st Century), has been compared to Leonard Bernstein's Mass.

It is commonly referred to as the Long Lance by most modern English-language naval historians, a nickname given to it after the war by Samuel Eliot Morison, the chief historian of the U.S. Navy, who spent much of the war in the Pacific Theater. In Japanese references, the term is also used, in reference to its propulsion system.‰ΩêËó§ÂíåÊ≠£, „ÄéÂ§™Âπ≥Ê¥ãÊµ∑Êà¶ 1 ÈÄ≤ÊîªÁØá„Äè. It was the most advanced naval torpedo in the world at the time.  History and development  The Type 93's development (in parallel with a submarine-launched model, the Type 95) began in Japan in 1928, under the auspices of Rear Admiral Kaneji Kishimoto and Captain Toshihide Asakuma. The torpedo design was inspired by the British oxygen-enriched torpedoes used on the s. At the time, the most powerful potential enemy of the Japanese Navy was the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet. The U.S. Navy's doctrine, presuming an invasion by Japan of the Philippines (an American commonwealth at that time), called for the battle line to fight its way across the Pacific Ocean, relieve or recapture the Philippines, and destroy the Japanese fleet. Since the IJN had fewer battleships than the U.S. Navy, it planned to use light forces (light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines) to whittle down the U.S. Navy's fleet in a succession of minor battles, mostly at night. After the number of American warships was sufficiently reduced, the IJN would commit its own presumably fresh and undamaged battleships to finish off the U.S. remnants in one huge climactic battle. (This was essentially what the U.S. Navy's \\"War Plan Orange\\" expected.) The Japanese Navy invested heavily in developing a large, heavy, and long-range torpedo, the Type 93. Torpedoes were the only weapon that gave small warships, such as destroyers, the potential to cripple or sink battleships. The IJN's torpedo research and development focused on using highly compressed oxygen instead of compressed air as the fuel oxidizer in the torpedo's propulsion system. These torpedoes used an otherwise normal wet- heater engine burning a fuel such as methanol or ethanol. Since air is only 21% oxygen (and 78% nitrogen), pure oxygen provides nearly five times as much oxidizer in the same tank volume, thereby increasing torpedo range. In addition, the absence of the inert nitrogen resulted in the emission of significantly less exhaust gas, comprising only carbon dioxide, which is significantly soluble in water, and water vapor, thus greatly reducing tell- tale bubble trails. Compressed oxygen is dangerous to handle and required lengthy research and development, not to mention additional training for the warship's torpedomen, for safe operational use. Eventually, the IJN's weapons development engineers found that by starting the torpedo's engine with compressed air, and then gradually switching to pure oxygen, they were able to overcome the problem of explosions that had hampered it before. To conceal the use of pure oxygen from the ship's crew and any potential enemy, the oxygen tank was named the secondary air tank. The pure oxygen torpedo was first deployed by the IJN in 1935.  Specification  Some specification examples of ranges by speed: * at * at * at However, the IJN announced officially the maximum performance of the Type 93 was at . The stated range of over was effective when the targeted warship steamed straight for more than a few minutes while the torpedo approached. This sometimes occurred when USN cruisers chased IJN destroyers breaking away from the scene of the battle at high speed during the night, or when American fleet carriers, engaged in flight operations, were targeted by IJN submarines in the South Pacific in 1942‚Äì43. The Type 93 weighed about , with a high explosive warhead of about . Rear Admiral Jungo Rai explained this weapon in the chapter \\"Torpedo\\", in collective work The Full Particulars of Secret WeaponsÔºàÁßòÂØÜÂÖµÂô®„ÅÆÂÖ®Ë≤å, first published by Koyo-sha, Japan, in 1952. The Type 93 torpedo had a main chamber filled with pure compressed oxygen, a joint regulator valve preventing reverse flow, and a small (approximately 13-liter) high-pressure air tank. First, compressed air was mixed with fuel, and the mixture was supplied to a heat starter. Ignition started gently, with the mixture burning steadily in the engine (if oxygen was used at this stage, explosions were common). As the compressed air was consumed and lost pressure, high-pressure oxygen was supplied from the main chamber through the joint valve into the compressed air tank. Soon the air tank was filled with pure oxygen, and combustion continued in the engine. The torpedo needed careful maintenance. Warships equipped with Type 93 torpedo launchers required an oxygen generator system to use this type of torpedo. A design engineer officer of torpedo section, Kure naval arsenal of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Ryozo Akagi, explained the Type 93 in his notebook. > The structure of the Type 93 torpedo can be separated into several parts; > from the front, warhead, air chamber, front float, engine compartment, rear > float, tail rudders, screw propellers. Type 93 rev.1 torpedo was equipped > with an oil-fueled twin-cylinder reciprocating engine. The engine used > second type air gas, a code name for 98% pure, high-pressure oxygen‚Äîthe word > \\"oxygen\\" was not used for secrecy. It could easily explode if an oil spot > remained inside the anfractuous air pipes. Cleaning pipes was the most > important maintenance task on the Type 93 torpedo, and took four or five > days. The practical use of the oxygen engine was top secret in the Imperial > Japanese Navy. First type air gas, a code name for air compressed to 230 > atm, from a 13.5-liter tank, was used to start the engine. The second type > air gas (oxygen) was stored at 225 atm in a 980-liter main chamber made by > machining a block of nickel chromium-molybdenum steel, an alloy first > developed for battleship armour. The front of the torpedo contained the > warhead, behind which was the shell of the 12mm (0.47 inch) thick main > chamber. While the Type 93 was approximately 9 m (29 ft 7-1/4 in) long and > 61 cm (24 in) in diameter, the second type air main chamber was 348 cm (11 > ft 5-3/8 in) long, occupying more than a third of the total length of the > torpedo. Behind the main chamber was the rear section of the torpedo. A > pressure regulator reduced the decreasing pressure of compressed gas in the > air chamber to the constant lower pressure needed to keep the torpedo > running at constant speed. The oxygen-fuel mixture was injected and exploded > in combustion chambers of the engine heads, pushing pistons and rotating the > single drive shaft. There were bevel gears on the shaft. The main shaft had > an inner and outer drive shaft and drove coaxial double four-bladed screws, > contra-rotating so as not to rotate the torpedo. The outer shell of the > torpedo was made of steel panels 3.2 mm (0.126 inch) thick, but 1.8 mm (0.07 > inch) thick at the rear, welded and water-tight. The plates at the engine > section were designed to leak water to cool the engine. There were two more > controlling air tanks of total capacity 40.5 liters containing air > compressed to 230 atm, to operate the rudders and stabilizers of the > torpedo. A depth meter controlled the running depth. The water pressure > board of the torpedo was manually set to five metres, to set the running > depth at five metres below the surface, and controlled the side stabilizer > to run at that depth. The tail vertical rudder meter set a vertical > gyrocompass to control the vertical tail rudders. The gyrocompass guided the > torpedo to the target, allowing even rear-launched torpedoes to turn around > and hit a target in front. The tail rudders and side stabilizers were > operated by air pressure. The gyro was started when the torpedo was > launched. The gyrocompass of Type 93 torpedo was 15 cm (5-7/8 in) in > diameter and 7 or 8 cm (3 in) thick, spinning at 8,000 rpm. The Type 93 > torpedo suffered from problems with this gyro speed when launched from a > warship steaming at its top speed of around 35 knots. The Imperial Japanese > Navy initially tested the torpedoes at Dainyu, Aga-Minami of Kure city, > Hiroshima prefecture, Japan, but the long-range Type 93 torpedo called for a > relatively large area for launching tests. Subsequently, the test range at > Otsu shima Island, Tokuyama city, Yamaguchi prefecture, next to Hiroshima > prefecture was used. The base later became famous as the home base of the > manned Kaiten \\"suicide torpedo\\".  Development of Kaiten from the Type 93  A Type 93 torpedo modified into a Kaiten, Tokyo Yasukuni Shrine Y≈´sh≈´kan War Memorial Museum. The rotational speed of the gyrocompass was increased to 20,000 rpm for the Kaiten manned torpedo. The warhead of the Type 93 torpedo was (the same as the 1 ton gun of an Imperial Japanese battleship), increased to 1.6 tons for Kaiten. The Type 93 torpedo is 9.61 meters long and weighs about three tons, while the Kaiten was 15 meters long and weighed 8 tons. The maximum speed of the Type 93 was and range . The Kaiten had a range at , at . The Kaiten had a stable slow cruising capability just beneath the surface. Operational history The Type 93 had a maximum range of at with a high explosive warhead. Its long range, high speed, and heavy warheads provided a formidable punch in surface battles. In contrast, the U.S. Navy's standard surface-launched torpedo of World War II, the Mark 15, had a maximum range of at , or at , with a significantly smaller warhead; torpedoes of other Allied nations did not have longer range. The Type 93 was launched from torpedo tubes mounted on the decks of IJN destroyers and cruisers; some Japanese destroyers, unlike ships of other navies, mounted their banks of torpedo tubes in turrets offering protection against splinters, and had tube loaders. The IJN armed nearly all of its cruisers with Type 93 torpedoes. In the early surface battles of 1942‚Äì43, Japanese destroyers and cruisers were able to launch their torpedoes from about at the unsuspecting Allied warships attempting to close to gun range. The Allied warships expected that, if torpedoes were used, they would be fired from not more than , their own typical torpedo range. The many torpedo hits suffered by Allied warships in such engagements led their officers to believe torpedoes had been fired by undetected Japanese submarines operating in concert with the surface warships. On rare occasions, stray Type 93s struck ships at a much longer range than their intended targets, leading the Allies on occasion to suspect their ships had been mined. The capabilities of the Type 93 went mostly unrecognized by the Allies until examples were captured intact in 1943. A 17.7 in (450 mm) version, the Type 97, was later developed for midget submarines, but was not a success, and was replaced operationally by Japan's standard aerial torpedo, the Type 91. A 21 in (53 cm) version for use by a few IJN submarines was designated the Type 95, and it was ultimately successful. A disadvantage of the Type 93 was that it was far more likely to detonate due to shock than a compressed-air torpedo. The explosion from one Type 93, with its heavy warhead, was usually enough to sink the destroyer, or heavily damage the cruiser, carrying it. As American air strikes against IJN ships became more common, captains of destroyers and cruisers under air attack had to decide whether or not to jettison torpedoes to prevent them from being detonated during the attack. In one instance, the heavy cruiser Chikuma jettisoned her Type 93s just before being hit by bombs from several USN dive bombers at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. During the Battle off Samar (in the eastern Philippines) a five-inch (127 mm) shell from escort carrier USS White Plains struck the heavy cruiser Ch≈çkai which detonated the cruiser's Type 93 torpedoes, disabling her rudder and engines; she was scuttled the next day (while in most circumstances a five-inch shell would not penetrate a cruiser's armored deck nor cause serious damage). The same Samar engagement saw the heavy cruiser Suzuya sunk by the detonation of her own Type 93 torpedoes: a bomb near miss starboard amidships set off the torpedoes in the starboard tube mounts; the resultant fires propagated to other torpedoes nearby and beyond; the subsequent explosions damaged one of the boilers and the starboard engine rooms and eventually reached the main magazines. Successes of the Type 93 torpedo Sources: While the Type 93 torpedo was dangerous to its user as well as its intended target, the Imperial Japanese Navy felt that its effectiveness outweighed its risks. During the course of the war, 23 Allied warships were sunk after Type 93 hits: 11 cruisers, 11 destroyers, and one fleet aircraft carrier. Thirteen of these had been fatally hit solely by the Type 93, with the rest succumbing to a combination of bombs, gunfire, and torpedoes.

The loquat is in the family Rosaceae, and is native to the cooler hill regions of south-central China. Since it reached its shores, the loquat has been grown in Japan for over 1,000 years, and has been introduced to regions with subtropical to mild temperate climates throughout the world. Eriobotrya japonica was formerly thought to be closely related to the genus Mespilus, and is still sometimes known as the Japanese medlar. It is also known as Japanese plum and Chinese plum, as well as pipa in China, and nespolo in southern Italy (in the northme is used for Mespilus germanicus). Description Eriobotrya japonica is a large evergreen shrub or small tree, with a rounded crown, short trunk and woolly new twigs. The tree can grow to tall, but is often smaller, about . The fruit begins to ripen during spring to summer depending on the temperature in the area. The leaves are alternate, simple, long, dark green, tough and leathery in texture, with a serrated margin, and densely velvety-hairy below with thick yellow-brown pubescence; the young leaves are also densely pubescent above, but this soon rubs off.Thunberg, Carl Peter.

Ripe single seeded loquats Fruit Fruit structure Loquats are unusual among fruit trees in that the flowers appear in the autumn or early winter, and the fruits are ripe at any time from early spring to early summer. The flowers are in diameter, white, with five petals, and produced in stiff panicles of three to ten flowers. The flowers have a sweet, heady aroma that can be smelled from a distance. Loquat fruits, growing in clusters, are oval, rounded or pear-shaped, long, with a smooth or downy, yellow or orange, sometimes red-blushed skin. The succulent, tangy flesh is white, yellow or orange and sweet to subacid or acid, depending on the cultivar. Each fruit contains from one to ten ovules, with three to five being most common. A variable number of the ovules mature into large brown seeds (with different numbers of seeds appearing in each fruit on the same tree, usually between one and four). The fruits are the sweetest when soft and orange. The flavour is a mixture of peach, citrus and mild mango.  History and taxonomy  Loquats and a Mountain Bird, by an anonymous Chinese artist of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127‚Äì1279). The plant is originally from China, where related species can be found growing in the wild. It has been cultivated there for over a thousand years. It has also become naturalised in Georgia, Armenia, Afghanistan, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bermuda, Chile, Kenya, India, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, the whole Mediterranean Basin, Pakistan, New Zealand, R√©union, Tonga, Central America, Mexico, South America and in warmer parts of the United States (Hawaii, California, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina). In Louisiana, many refer to loquats as \\"misbeliefs\\" and they grow in yards of homes. Chinese immigrants are presumed to have carried the loquat to Hawaii and California.Biota of North America Project, Eriobotrya japonica. bonap.net (2014)loquat, Eriobotrya japonica. Weeds of Australia, Queensland Biosecurity Edition It has been cultivated in Japan for about 1,000 years and presumably the fruits and seeds were brought back from China to Japan by the many Japanese scholars visiting and studying in China during the Tang Dynasty. The loquat was often mentioned in medieval Chinese literature, such as the poems of Li Bai. Its original name is no longer used in most Chinese dialects, and has been replaced by pipa (), which is a reference to the fruit's visual resemblance to a miniature pipa lute. The first European record of the species might have been in the 16th century by Micha≈Ç Boym Polish jesuit, orientalist, politician and missionary to China. He described loquat in his Flora sinensis, the first European natural history book about China.Flora Chin. W: Edward Kajda≈Ñski: Micha≈Ç Boym: ambasador Pa≈Ñstwa ≈örodka. Warszawa: KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1999, s. 183. .(pol.) The common name for the fruit is from portuguese n√™spera (from the modified nespilus, originally mespilus, which referred to the medlar), (Jos√© Pedro Machado, Dicion√°rio Etimol√≥gico da L√≠ngua Portuguesa, 1967). Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the hachiya persimmon variety. Eriobotrya japonica was again described in Europe by Carl Peter Thunberg, as Mespilus japonica in 1780, and was relocated to the genus Eriobotrya (from Greek ŒµœÅŒπŒø \\"wool\\" and Œ≤ŒøœÑœÅœÖœéŒΩ \\"cluster\\") by John Lindley, who published these changes in 1821. The most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magn√≥rio/magn√≥lio, probably something to do with the French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called \\"n√≠speros\\" and are commercially exploited, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with 41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets. Cultivation Over 800 loquat cultivars exist in Asia. Self-fertile variants include the 'Gold Nugget' and 'Mogi' cultivars. The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates where it is often primarily grown as an ornamental plant, especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit. The boldly textured foliage adds a tropical look to gardens, contrasting well with many other plants. Loquat in flower. This is a cultivar intended for home- growing, where the flowers open gradually resulting in fruit also ripening gradually. Fruit There are many named cultivars, with orange or white flesh. Some cultivars are intended for home-growing, where the flowers open gradually, and thus the fruit also ripens gradually, compared to the commercially grown species where the flowers open almost simultaneously, and the whole tree's fruit also ripens together. Japan is the leading producer of loquats followed by Israel and then Brazil. In Europe, Spain is the main producer of loquat. In temperate climates it is grown as an ornamental with winter protection, as the fruits seldom ripen to an edible state. In the United Kingdom, it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In the US, the loquat tree is hardy only in USDA zones 8 and above, and will flower only where winter temperatures do not fall below . In such areas, the tree flowers in autumn and the fruit ripens in late winter. It is popular in the East, as well as the South. Culinary use Loquat on plate The loquat has a high sugar, acid and pectin content. It is eaten as a fresh fruit and mixes well with other fruits in fresh fruit salads or fruit cups. The fruits are also commonly used to make jam, jelly and chutney, and are often served poached in light syrup. Firm, slightly immature fruits are best for making pies or tarts. The fruit is sometimes canned or processed into confections. The waste ratio is 30 percent or more, due to the seed size. Ripe and unripe loquats Alcoholic beverages Loquats can also be used to make light wine. They are fermented into a fruit wine, sometimes using just crystal sugar and white liquor. In Italy nespolino liqueur is made from the seeds, reminiscent of nocino and amaretto, both prepared from nuts and apricot kernels. Both the loquat seeds and the apricot kernels contain cyanogenic glycosides, but the drinks are prepared from varieties that contain only small quantities (such as Mogi and Tanaka), so there is no risk of cyanide poisoning. Nutrition The loquat is low in sodium and high in vitamin A, vitamin B6, dietary fiber, potassium, and manganese. Like most related plants, the seeds (pips) and young leaves of the plant are slightly poisonous, containing small amounts of cyanogenic glycosides (including amygdalin) which release cyanide when digested, though the low concentration and bitter flavour normally prevent enough being eaten to cause harm. Etymology venation The name loquat derives from lou4 gwat1, the Cantonese pronunciation of the classical , literally \\"black orange\\". The phrase \\"black orange\\" originally actually referred to unripened kumquats, which are dark green in color. But the name was mistakenly applied to the loquat we know today by the ancient Chinese poet Su Shi when he was residing in southern China, and the mistake was widely taken up by the Cantonese region thereafter. Symbolism In China, the loquat is known as the 'pipa' (ÊûáÊù∑) and because of its golden colour, represents gold and wealth. It is often one in a bowl or composite of fruits and vegetables (such as spring onions, artemisia leaves, pomegranates, kumquats, etc.) to represent auspicious wishes or the 'Five Prosperities' or wurui (‰∫îÁëû).Welch, Patricia Bjaaland.

It was an important trading burgh in High Medieval to early modern Scotland. In the Middle Ages it had at least as much importance as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, or Berwick-upon-Tweed, for a time acting as de facto capital (as royal residence of David I). History Its significance lay in its position in the centre of some of Lowland Scotland's most agriculturally fertile areas, and its position upon the River Tweed, which allowed river transport of goods via the main seaport of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Its position also acted as a barrier to English invasion. Standing on a defensible peninsula between the rivers Tweed and Teviot, with Roxburgh Castle guarding the narrow neck of the peninsula, it was a settlement of some importance during the reign of David I who conferred Royal Burgh status upon the town. At its zenith, between the reigns of William the Lion and James II, it was the site of the Royal mint. The town also had three churches and schools which operated under the auspices of the monks of Kelso Abbey. In 1237, the future Alexander III was born there.Groome, Francis H. (1901) Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, p. 1408-9 English and Scots forces repeatedly captured and recaptured the town during the Scottish Wars of Independence. During his occupation of Scotland, Edward III of England resided at Roxburgh Castle, spending at least two birthdays there. The castle was besieged several times, notably in 1314, in the run-up to Bannockburn. Its final recapture in 1460 saw the town and castle destroyed. After this time the town never regained its importance because the final English capture of Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1482 left Roxburgh with little reason to exist, henceforth lacking a port. Nothing remains of the town except some ruined segments of castle ramparts. Its site lies to the south of modern Kelso and Floors Castle, which lie on the other side of the Tweed. Roxburgh was superseded as the county town of the former county of Roxburghshire by Jedburgh. Very little else is known about this hugely important site, in part due to the landowner Duke of Roxburghe's refusal to allow archaeologists to dig here until comparatively recently. The Channel Four television programme Time Team undertook excavation work in 2003, and their findings were broadcast on 21 March, 2004.https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/sites/default/files/52568_Roxburgh.pdf Etymology Roxburgh probably comes from Old English *hr≈çcas burh, \\"rook's burgh\\".roxburgh Family History Facts 1920 ‚Äì Ancestry.com Roxburgh District File:Scot1975Roxburgh.pngRoxburgh District 1975‚Äì96 In more recent times (1975‚Äì1996), \\"Roxburgh\\" referred to a local government district in the Borders region of Scotland.

Designed as a replacement for the World War II‚Äìera propeller-driven P-61 Black Widow night/interceptor aircraft, the XF-87 lost in government procurement competition to the Northrop F-89 Scorpion. The loss of the contract was fatal to the company; the Curtiss- Wright Corporation closed down its aviation division, selling its assets to North American Aviation. Design and development The aircraft started life as a project for an attack aircraft, designated XA-43. When the United States Army Air Forces issued a requirement for a jet-powered all-weather fighter in 1945, the design was reworked for that request. The XP-87 was a large mid-wing aircraft with four engines paired in underwing pods, with a mid-mounted tailplane and tricycle undercarriage. Two crew members (pilot and radar operator) sat side by side under a single canopy. Armament was to be a nose- mounted, powered turret containing four 20 mm (0.79 in) cannon, but this was never fitted to the prototypes. Instead the aircraft was armed with four fixed forward firing 20mm cannon.Bowers, Curtiss Aircraft, pp.509-510 Operational history The first flight of the XF-87 Blackhawk was on 5 March 1948.Associated Press, \\"Four-Jet Fighter, Weighing as Much As B-17, Tested\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 2 March 1948, Volume LIV, Number 158, page 1. Although the top speed was slower than expected, the aircraft was otherwise acceptable, and the newly formed (in September 1947) United States Air Force placed orders for 57 F-87A fighters and 30 RF-87A reconnaissance aircraft just over a month later. Since the performance problems were due to lack of power, the four Westinghouse XJ34-WE-7 turbojets of the prototypes were to be substituted for two General Electric J47 jets in production models. One of the two XF-87 prototypes was to be modified as a test bed for the new engines. At this point, the USAF decided that the Northrop F-89 Scorpion was a more promising aircraft. The F-87 contract was cancelled on 10 October 1948, and both prototypes were scrapped.

She was originally designed as a ship with a lighter armament due to financial problems and the pacifist movement. Later in the design stage, an extra gun turret was added and the armor was improved. She was the seventh ship of the Dutch Navy to be named after Admiral Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter. De Ruyter was laid down on 16 September 1933 at the Wilton-Fijenoord dockyard in Schiedam and commissioned on 3 October 1936, commanded by Captain A. C. van der Sande Lacoste. She was sunk in the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942. Design De Ruyter was designed during the Great Depression, which, in addition to being a period of economic depression, was also a period in which pacifism was widespread in the Netherlands. For these reasons, the design was officially called a flottieljeleider (flotilla leader) instead of a cruiser, and every effort was made to cut costs. Its function was to aid the two existing cruisers of the in the defence of the Dutch East Indies; the idea was that with three cruisers, there would always be two cruisers available, even if one cruiser had to be repaired. However, due to the cost-cutting policy that went into her design, De Ruyter was not quite up to her task. Her main battery (7 √ó 150 mm guns) was underpowered in comparison to other light cruisers of the time (for example the British ), and the class had inadequate armour as well and lacked long range anti-aircraft guns. However, her fire control system was excellent. Service history During World War II, De Ruyter saw repeated action in the Dutch East Indies in fruitless attempts to ward off the Japanese invasion. She was damaged by air attack in the Battle of Bali Sea on 4 February 1942, but not seriously. She fought in the Battle of Badung Strait on 18 February. left In the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February, De Ruyter was the flagship of the Dutch Rear-Admiral Karel Doorman, with his flag captain Eug√®ne Lacombl√© (who had previously served on board the ship as a lieutenant). Off the north coast off Java on the evening of the 27th the remains of the ABDA fleet was surprised by the Japanese heavy cruisers and . Several minutes after the Dutch cruiser Java had been torpedoed and sunk, De Ruyter was hit by a single Type 93 torpedo fired by Haguro at about 23:40 and was set on fire; the torpedo also disabled the ship's electrical systems and left the crew unable to combat the fire or the flooding. The De Ruyter sank at about 02:30 the next morning with the loss of 367 men, including Admiral Doorman and Captain Lacombl√©. Wreck The wreck of De Ruyter was discovered by specialist wreck divers on 1 December 2002 and declared a war grave, with the ship's two bells‚Äîone now in the Kloosterkerk in the Hague‚Äîbeing recovered. The wreck of , was also found the same day by the same divers. The same dive group then found on 12 August 2004. In 2016 it was discovered that the wrecks of De Ruyter and Java, and much of Kortenaer had disappeared from the seabed, although their imprints on the ocean floor remained. Over 100 ships and submarines of various countries sank during the war in the seas around Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia; many are designated as war graves. There is known to be illegal scavenging of these wrecks, often using explosives; the Netherlands Defence Ministry suggested that De Ruyter, Java, and Kortenaer may have been illegally salvaged. In February 2017 a report was issued confirming the salvaging of the three wrecks.https://www.maritiem- erfgoed.nl/sites/default/files/field_attachments/report_verification_mission_feb_2017_java_seapublic_210217.pdf References in text References * van Oosten, Franz Christiaan. \\"Her Netherlands Majesty's Ship De Ruyter.\\" In Profile Warship, edited by Anthony Preston, 73-96.

Originally designated as a flotilla leader and a torpedo cruiser in Decker's Fleet Plan of 1931, she was hastily commissioned on 10 May 1940, when Germany invaded the Netherlands. However, as she was not armed she escaped to the United Kingdom, where she was refitted as an air defence cruiser, since these were the only type of gun available, and there was a growing need for this type of ship to protect the convoys. During the Second World War the crew felt that their ship was blessed and gave her the nickname Oude Jacob (Old Jacob). She received the reputation for proficiency, and not a single convoy ship would be lost when she was on duty.  Service history The ship was meant to commence trials on the day the Germans invaded, and to prevent her capture the Heemskerck was immediately pressed into service. Since she had no armament she left port for the United Kingdom with only a skeleton crew. Once she had arrived in Portsmouth attempts were made to give her weaponry of some sort. She received depth charge equipment from the old torpedo boats G13 and G15. On 18 May 1940, Queen Wilhelmina paid the ship a visit. At the end of the month, Heemskerck and the cruiser received the assignment to transport Princess Juliana and her two children (including the later Beatrix of the Netherlands) to Canada. The ships put to sea on 2 June and arrived on 11 June at Halifax. Heemskerck returned alone to England and arrived at Portsmouth in July where her re-arming programme began. The British Admiralty decided to convert her to an anti-aircraft ship. Work was completed on 17 February 1941, and after sea trials, which lasted till 29 February, the ship was assigned as a convoy escort in the Atlantic Ocean as part of the Irish Sea Escort. She was removed from escort duty in January 1942 and sent to the Dutch East Indies to reinforce the defence fleet assembled there. The ship arrived too late to take part in the battle of the Java Sea and was reassigned to the Eastern Fleet in 1942. In September 1942 the ship took part in operations 'Stream' and 'Jane', both aimed at the retaking of Madagascar. On 25 October Heemskerck arrived at Fremantle, Australia, and came under the command of Allied Naval Forces Western Australia, where she performed convoy duties. On 28 November 1942, Heemskerck, in the company of the Australian cruiser , identified and damaged the German supply vessel and blockade runner Ramses, which was subsequently scuttled by her own crew in the Indian Ocean. On 1 December 1943, the ship returned to the Eastern Fleet and on 27 December, she set sail for the Mediterranean Sea where she, again, performed convoy duties till she was recalled to England for maintenance in June 1944. On 26 July 1945 Jacob van Heemskerck arrived at Amsterdam, the first Dutch warship to do so after Liberation Day. In September of that year she set sail for the Dutch East Indies, where she performed patrol duties until 22 July 1946. She returned to the Netherlands in August of that year. Post-war From 12 March 1951 she served as a barracks ship for naval trainees in Vlissingen. She served in this capacity in several other locations. The cruiser was decommissioned on 20 November 1969, and was struck from the Naval Registry on 27 February 1970. On 23 June 1970 the ship was sold for scrap.

Definition An (imaginary) hyperelliptic curve of genus g over a field K is given by the equation C : y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) \\\\in K[x,y] where h(x) \\\\in K[x] is a polynomial of degree not larger than g and f(x) \\\\in K[x] is a monic polynomial of degree 2g + 1. From this definition it follows that elliptic curves are hyperelliptic curves of genus 1. In hyperelliptic curve cryptography K is often a finite field. The Jacobian of C, denoted J(C), is a quotient group, thus the elements of the Jacobian are not points, they are equivalence classes of divisors of degree 0 under the relation of linear equivalence. This agrees with the elliptic curve case, because it can be shown that the Jacobian of an elliptic curve is isomorphic with the group of points on the elliptic curve. The use of hyperelliptic curves in cryptography came about in 1989 from Neal Koblitz. Although introduced only 3 years after ECC, not many cryptosystems implement hyperelliptic curves because the implementation of the arithmetic isn't as efficient as with cryptosystems based on elliptic curves or factoring (RSA). The efficiency of implementing the arithmetic depends on the underlying finite field K, in practice it turns out that finite fields of characteristic 2 are a good choice for hardware implementations while software is usually faster in odd characteristic. The Jacobian on a hyperelliptic curve is an Abelian group and as such it can serve as group for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). In short, suppose we have an Abelian group G and g an element of G, the DLP on G entails finding the integer a given two elements of G, namely g and g^a. The first type of group used was the multiplicative group of a finite field, later also Jacobians of (hyper)elliptic curves were used. If the hyperelliptic curve is chosen with care, then Pollard's rho method is the most efficient way to solve DLP. This means that, if the Jacobian has n elements, that the running time is exponential in \\\\log(n). This makes it possible to use Jacobians of a fairly small order, thus making the system more efficient. But if the hyperelliptic curve is chosen poorly, the DLP will become quite easy to solve. In this case there are known attacks which are more efficient than generic discrete logarithm solvers or even subexponential. Hence these hyperelliptic curves must be avoided. Considering various attacks on DLP, it is possible to list the features of hyperelliptic curves that should be avoided. Attacks against the DLP All generic attacks on the discrete logarithm problem in finite abelian groups such as the Pohlig‚ÄìHellman algorithm and Pollard's rho method can be used to attack the DLP in the Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves. The Pohlig-Hellman attack reduces the difficulty of the DLP by looking at the order of the group we are working with. Suppose the group G that is used has n = p_1^{r_1} \\\\cdots p_k^{r_k} elements, where p_1^{r_1} \\\\cdots p_k^{r_k} is the prime factorization of n. Pohlig-Hellman reduces the DLP in G to DLPs in subgroups of order p_i for i = 1,...,k. So for p the largest prime divisor of n, the DLP in G is just as hard to solve as the DLP in the subgroup of order p. Therefore we would like to choose G such that the largest prime divisor p of \\\\\\\\#G = n is almost equal to n itself. Requiring \\\\frac{n}{p} \\\\leq 4 usually suffices. The index calculus algorithm is another algorithm that can be used to solve DLP under some circumstances. For Jacobians of (hyper)elliptic curves there exists an index calculus attack on DLP. If the genus of the curve becomes too high, the attack will be more efficient than Pollard's rho. Today it is known that even a genus of g=3 cannot assure security.Jasper Scholten and Frederik Vercauteren, An Introduction to Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography and the NTRU Cryptosystem, section 4 Hence we are left with elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. Another restriction on the hyperelliptic curves we can use comes from the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone- attack / Frey-R√ºck-attack. The first, often called MOV for short, was developed in 1993, the second came about in 1994. Consider a (hyper)elliptic curve C over a finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} where q is the power of a prime number. Suppose the Jacobian of the curve has n elements and p is the largest prime divisor of n. For k the smallest positive integer such that p q^k - 1 there exists a computable injective group homomorphism from the subgroup of J(C) of order p to \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^{*}. If k is small, we can solve DLP in J(C) by using the index calculus attack in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^{*}. For arbitrary curves k is very large (around the size of q^g); so even though the index calculus attack is quite fast for multiplicative groups of finite fields this attack is not a threat for most curves. The injective function used in this attack is a pairing and there are some applications in cryptography that make use of them. In such applications it is important to balance the hardness of the DLP in J(C) and \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^{*}; depending on the security level values of k between 6 and 12 are useful. The subgroup of \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^{*} is a torus. There exists some independent usage in torus based cryptography. We also have a problem, if p, the largest prime divisor of the order of the Jacobian, is equal to the characteristic of \\\\mathbb{F}_{q}. By a different injective map we could then consider the DLP in the additive group \\\\mathbb{F}_q instead of DLP on the Jacobian. However, DLP in this additive group is trivial to solve, as can easily be seen. So also these curves, called anomalous curves, are not to be used in DLP. Order of the Jacobian Hence, in order to choose a good curve and a good underlying finite field, it is important to know the order of the Jacobian. Consider a hyperelliptic curve C of genus g over the field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q} where q is the power of a prime number and define C_k as C but now over the field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}. It can be shown Alfred J. Menezes, Yi-Hong Wu, Robert J. Zuccherato, An elementary introduction to hyperelliptic curves, page 30 that the order of the Jacobian of C_k lies in the interval [(\\\\sqrt{q}^{k} - 1)^{2g}, (\\\\sqrt{q}^{k} + 1)^{2g}], called the Hasse-Weil interval. But there is more, we can compute the order using the zeta-function on hyperelliptic curves. Let A_k be the number of points on C_k. Then we define the zeta-function of C = C_1 as Z_{C}(t) = \\\\exp(\\\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\\\infty}{A_i \\\\frac{t^i}{i}}). For this zeta- function it can be shown Alfred J. Menezes, Yi-Hong Wu, Robert J. Zuccherato, An elementary introduction to hyperelliptic curves, page 29 that Z_C(t) = \\\\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)(1-qt)} where P(t) is a polynomial of degree 2g with coefficients in \\\\mathbb{Z}. Furthermore P(t) factors as P(t) = \\\\prod_{i = 1}^{g}{(1-a_it)(1-\\\\bar{a_i}t)} where a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} for all i = 1,...,g. Here \\\\bar{a} denotes the complex conjugate of a. Finally we have that the order of J(C_k) equals \\\\prod_{i = 1}^{g}{1 - a_i^k^2}. Hence orders of Jacobians can be found by computing the roots of P(t).

It is the United Kingdom's largest inland fish market. It takes its name from Billingsgate, a ward in the south-east corner of the City of London, where the riverside market was originally established. In its original location in the 19th century, Billingsgate was the largest fish market in the world. History City of London The original open air Billingsgate Fish Market in the early 19th century. Boats delivered fish to this small inlet of the Thames and business was conducted on the quayside. Billingsgate Wharf, close to Lower Thames Street, became the centre of a fish market during the 16th and 17th centuries but did not become formally established until an Act of Parliament in 1699.'William III, 1698: An Act for making Billingsgate a Free Market for Sale of Fish. [Chapter XIII. Rot. Parl. 10 Gul. III. p.3. n.4.]', Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695‚Äì1701 (1820), pp. 513‚Äì514. Accessed 9 March 2007 In 1850, the market, according to Horace Jones, \\"consisted only of shed buildings ... The open space on the north of the well-remembered Billingsgate Dock was dotted with low booths and sheds, with a range of wooden houses with a piazza in front on the west, which served the salesmen and fishmongers as shelter, and for the purposes of carrying on their trade.\\" In that year the market was rebuilt to a design by J. B. Bunning, the City architect. Bunning's building was soon found to be insufficient for the increased trade, and in 1872 the Corporation obtained an Act to rebuild and enlarge the market, which was done to plans by Bunning's successor as City architect Sir Horace Jones. The new site covered almost twice the area of the old, incorporating Billingsgate Stairs and Wharf and Darkhouse Lane. Work began in 1874, and the new market was opened by the Lord Mayor on 20 July 1877. The new buildings, Italianate in style, had on their long frontages towards Thames Street the river, a pedimented centre and continuous arcade, flanked at each end by a pavilion tavern. The general market, on a level with Thames Street, had an area of about , and was covered with louvre glass roofs, high at the ridge. A gallery wide was allocated to the sale of dried fish, while the basement served as a market for shellfish. Electric lighting was also furnished in November 1878 via 16 Jablochkoff Candles. The opening of the railways changed the nature of the trade, and by the late nineteenth century most of the fish arrived at the market via the Great Eastern Railway. The infamously coarse language of London fishmongers made \\"Billingsgate\\" a byword for crude or vulgar language.Word of the Day Archive - Monday June 12, 2006 accessed 21 May 2007 One of its earliest uses can be seen in a 1577 chronicle by Raphael Holinshed, where the writer makes reference to the foul tongues of Billingsgate oyster-wives. The market is depicted during Tudor times in Rosemary Sutcliff's 1951 children's historical novel The Armourer's House. The writer George Orwell worked at Billingsgate in the 1930s, as did the Kray twins in the 1950s. Poplar In 1982, the fish market was relocated to a new building complex on the Isle of Dogs in Poplar, close to Canary Wharf and Blackwall. The freehold owner of the site is the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, but the City of London Corporation still runs the market; they pay an annual ground rent stipulated in an agreement between the two councils as \\"the gift of one fish\\". Most of the fish sold through the market now arrives there by road, from ports as far afield as Aberdeen and Cornwall. Billingsgate Market is open from Tuesday to Saturday. Trading commences at 4 a.m. and finishes at 8:30 a.m. Security for the market is provided by the private Market Constabulary. Traditionally, the only people allowed to move fish around the market were licensed fish porters.

Built just prior to World War II, the ship served mainly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans against the Japanese, being based out of Sydney, Fremantle and Trincomalee where she served alongside British, Australian and US warships. After the war, the she returned to the Netherlands and after 1949 Tromp was used as a training and accommodation ship, before being decommissioned in 1955, and scrapped in 1969. Design and description Originally designated as a flotilla leader in the Deckers Fleet Plan of 1931, Tromp was ordered in 1935 and laid down at the Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij (Netherlands Shipbuilding Company), in Amsterdam, on 17 January 1936. She was launched on 24 May 1937 and then commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy on 18 August 1938. She was named after Admirals Maarten Tromp and Cornelis Tromp. Tromp was long, had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced 3,450 tons at standard load with 860 tons of bunkerage. Powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, with four Yarrow boilers that drove two shafts and produced , she was capable of achieving a maximum speed of . Upon construction, the ship's complement was 295, although this later increased to 380. Her armament consisted of six guns twin-mounted in three turrets, as well as two twin-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns. As built, she also had two twin-mounted .50 calibre machine guns, although these were later replaced with two single- mounted 20 mm Oerlikons. In addition, for anti-aircraft defence, she was later fitted out with an extra six 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns, four US-made 75 mm guns and four more 40 mm Bofors. She also carried six torpedo tubes in two banks of three, and was equipped with a Fokker C.XIW floatplane. Her anti- submarine features included ASDIC, a hydrophone, and four depth-charge throwers. Her deck armour was , while her side belt armour was . Upon her commissioning, Tromp was arguably the most powerful ship in the Dutch navy. Service history HNLMS Tromp in Sydney, 1943, wearing Measure 22 camouflage Following her commissioning, Tromp carried out working up manouevres until early January 1939 when she departed Rotterdam, bound for the Mediterranean. Transiting via Lisbon, in Portugal, on 15 January, she was lightly damaged when she accidentally collided with the German passenger ship Orinoco. She returned to the Netherlands in April to take part in the fleet review at Scheveningen, before participating in a cruise to Norway, where she stopped over at Oslo. In July 1939, Commander J. W. Termijtelen took over command of the ship from Captain L.A.C.M. Doorman and under Termijtelen's command the ship sailed for the Netherlands East Indies in August 1939, arriving just after the outbreak of World War II in Europe. In mid-September 1939, the ship searched several German merchantmen in Padang, before proceeding to Surabaya for a refit. Throughout 1940, the ship undertook patrol and escort duties as part of the Netherlands East Indies Squadron before escorting ships of the Java-New York Line in a convoy to the Gilbert Islands in early 1941. A new captain, Commander J.B. de Meester, arrived in July. In the final months of 1941, tensions in the region began to heighten amidst concerns about war with Japan and in November 1941 Tromp was involved in searches of Vichy French merchant vessels operating in the area. In late November and early December 1941, Tromp moved to the western Java Sea to help search for , which was missing after encountering the German raider Kormoran. Following the outbreak of fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific, she was assigned to the Combined Striking Force, ABDA Command, in January 1942 for the defence of the East Indies. Tromp was badly damaged off Bali on 18 February 1942 during the Battle of Badung Strait, when she was hit by eleven 5-inch (127 mm) shells from the Japanese destroyer . Her return fire hit two Japanese destroyers, killing four men on Asashio and seven on . The ship was then sent to Australia for repairs in February 1942, sailing firstly to Fremantle and then on to Sydney. Repairs were completed by May 1942, at which time she began a period of sea trials. These were interrupted by anti-submarine patrols off Newcastle in the middle of the month after the Soviet steamer Wellen was attacked, but these patrols proved uneventful. On 18 May 1942, in company with , Tromp escorted convoy \\"ZK.8\\" out of Sydney composed of the Dutch ships , Bontekoe, and Van Heutsz bound for Port Moresby with 4,735 troops of the Australian 14th Brigade. Afterwards, Tromp escorted several more north-bound convoys before completing its sea trials in early June. The following month she departed Sydney bound for Fremantle, escorting a westward-bound convoy. She remained in Fremantle until October 1942 when the ship returned to Sydney to replace her radar. Upon completion, she undertook a visit to New Zealand before returning to Fremantle at the end of the year in concert with a British troopship, Nestor. In February 1943, while based out of Fremantle, Tromp was assigned to the US Seventh Fleet, tasked with conducting convoy escort around Australia and in the Indian Ocean. Throughout the year, Tromp undertook further convoy escorts until October when Commander F. Stam arrived to take over command. In January 1944, Tromp was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet based at Colombo, in Ceylon. A short time later, she was transferred to the fleet base at Trincomalee. The ship then participated in raids on Sabang in April and Surabaya in May 1944, undertaking escort duty in between. She transferred to Sydney for a refit in September 1944, remaining there until February 1945, when Tromp returned to Trincomalee to undertake further escort duty. In the final months of the war, Tromp was part of the Allied fleet that bombarded Japanese positions prior to the Australian 7th Division's landing at Balikpapan during operations to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. Following the end of the hostilities, Tromp was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet and in September 1945 deployed to Jakarta where she landed marines who re- occupied the governor's residence as Allied forces arrived to disarm the Japanese garrison. She then ferried liberated Dutch prisoners-of-war between Singapore, Bangkok and Sydney during the final months of the year. She remained in Sydney until February 1946 when she sailed for the Netherlands to return over 150 former prisoners-of-war. Upon her return to the Netherlands in May 1946, the ship underwent a significant refit which lasted until mid-1948. From 1949, Tromp was used mainly as a training or accommodation ship, before being decommissioned in 1955 and scrapped in 1969.

It is possible that Strath Nid actually represents the Cumbric Ystrad Nidd as Cumbric (arising as it did from the British Language) was the dominant language in this area from before Roman times until the 11th or 12th Century whereas Gaelic influence here was late and transient. The River Nith flows north to south through the Southern Uplands in south-west Scotland, separating the Lowther hills from the Scaur hills. Nithsdale has historically been a strategic area as it forms an invasion route from England into central Scotland. Nithsdale was also a historic district of Scotland, bordering Annandale to the east, Clydesdale to the north, Kyle to the north- west and Galloway to the west. The district was in the Sheriffdom of Dumfries and later became part of the County of Dumfries, one of the counties of Scotland. The main re-organisation took place during the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, this Act established a uniform system of county councils in Scotland and realigned the boundaries of many of Scotland‚Äôs counties.

The Guild of World Traders was formed in 1985 and it became a Company in 1993. Its petition for livery status was granted by the Court of Aldermen with effect from 2000. The Worshipful Company draws its membership from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade. The Company ranks 101st in the order of precedence of the City Livery Companies. Its motto is Commerce and Honest Friendship with All, taken from Thomas Jefferson's inaugural Presidential speech. Introduction The founding of the World Traders Association movement gave rise to the creation of trading complexes in over 160 cities throughout the world. London was the first in Europe, built in St Katharine Docks beside the Tower of London (though this World Trade Centre closed in 1994). Over 1,000 years earlier the same land was used by the Knighten Guilde to trade in foreign goods, and in 1979 the then Lord Mayor, Sir Peter Gadsden, suggested that this tradition be revived by the creation of the Guild of World Traders to represent members of the international trading community in the City of London. The Company's founding Master was Mr Peter Drew OBE. From the outset the World Traders were determined to be a working Guild, only accepting members from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade. The Company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of Chartered Accountants, Actuaries, Arbitrators, International Bankers, Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Insurers, Information Technologists, City of London Solicitors, Management Consultants, Marketors, and Tax Advisers. Activities The UK, principally through London, has a ¬£40bn trade surplus in financial and professional services representing 3% of UK GDP. World Traders represent virtually every form of financial service and are committed to retaining and growing London‚Äôs services. World traders consist largely of three groups. ;Brokers :People who trade services. A great number of members work within the financial services sector of the City of London, for example, ship brokers, insurance brokers, commodity brokers, stockbrokers and currency dealers. ;Traders :People who trade tangible goods and products. These members are often importers and exporters, for example, of foodstuffs, pharmaceutical products, metals and various industrial products from doors to bridge builders. ;Financial services :Professionals who have a specialty in supporting international business. These members include lawyers, bankers, accountants, patent attorneys, academics and consultants. World Traders are at the forefront of debates shaping the future, for example the structure of the Eurozone, banking & insurance regulation, reducing trade barriers, growing the fledgling carbon markets, and long-term sustainability of the environment and finance. The 250 World Traders are international. As well as UK-based British nationals, a significant number of the Livery are overseas nationals based in the UK, dual nationals, British nationals who live overseas and overseas nationals who live in their home country. World Traders host a large number of foreign visitors looking to relocate or establish trading connections with the UK not just from primary trading partners in the EU, China, Brazil, Russia, India or the Gulf states, but also from smaller countries which may benefit from personal support and contacts. The Company‚Äôs hallmark annual event is the Tacitus Lecture, begun in 1988, now one of the largest intellectual events in the City of London‚Äôs calendar. The event gives a senior individual an opportunity to initiate discussion of serious concern to world trade in a global forum. Key dates 23 November 1974 General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association held at London Guildhall. Alderman Richard Charvet suggested the creation of the Guild of World Traders in London. 26 November 1979 Lord Mayor Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden laid foundation stone of International House (part of the then London World Trade Centre complex) and reiterates the suggestion of the creation of the Guild of World Traders. 24 October 1985 First meeting of the Guild of World Traders in London. 15 June 1993 Grant by the Court of Aldermen to become The Company of World Traders. 9 November 1999 Petition to become The Worshipful Company of World Traders agreed by the Court of Aldermen, with effect from 1 January 2000. 25 January 2000 Company received its letters patent in a ceremony at Mansion House, from the Lord Mayor, Alderman Clive Martin. 10 July 2013 Queen Elizabeth II granted a Royal Charter to the Company. Arms, Crest and Motto The Arms of the Company were designed by Sir Colin Cole, Garter Principal King of Arms, and presented by him at the Installation ceremony of Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden, the Guild's new Master, in 1987. These Arms depict five purses symbolising trade between the five continents, with the sword and wheel of St Catherine together with the water and quayside of the dock, as a reminder of the company's foundation. The Arms are surmounted by a carbocle containing a medieval merchant's cap and the supporters are a dolphin borrowed from the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, who originally gave the company sanctuary in the City of London, and the sea dragon of the City as a mark of respect for its commands. The Master's Badge of office displays the Company's coat of arms mounted on a piece of rock crystal, donated by the World Trade Centre of Rio de Janeiro, carved with an outline of five continents. The motif on the Company tie derives from the Company's crest: it comprises the helm, torse and mantelling surmounted by the wheel of St Catherine upon which is a medieval merchant's cap. The Company's motto is \\"Commerce and honest friendship with all\\", a quote from Thomas Jefferson's inaugural Presidential speech. Company Officers Master: Dr Edwina Moreton OBE Senior Warden: Mr Peter Alvey Junior Warden: Mrs Sue Algeo Clerk: Mrs Gaye Duffy The Worshipful Company of World Traders is governed by its Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, and a Court of Assistants which elects the forthcoming Master and Wardens. The chief executive officer of the Company is known as the Clerk. The Master and Wardens serve the Company in their respective roles for a period of one year, after which time the Master becomes 'Immediate Past Master', the Senior Warden becomes the Master of the Company and the Junior Warden is promoted to the role of Senior Warden. A new Junior Warden is then elected by the Court of Assistants. Past Masters advise the incumbent Master and can resume as Master should the need arise. The appointment to the office of Clerk is not subject to annual election.

These arise from the specific interests of our members, or because they have intrinsic relevance to world trade. At present there are three affiliations. The Annual Country Partnership Each year the incumbent Master chooses a country with which to foster a relationship. The purposes of this may well be obvious: to learn more about that country, to offer the hand of friendship to their representatives, and of course to facilitate for liverymen any trading opportunities that there may be with the country in question. 1st Battalion The Rifles During the Summer of 2010 a formal affiliation between the Worshipful Company of the World Traders and The Rifles, the Army's biggest and youngest Infantry Regiment was established. The affiliation is run through the 1st Battalion The Rifles. The Rifles was formed in February 2007 from The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, The Royal Gloucestershire Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, The Light Infantry and The Royal Green Jackets. The Rifles is the largest infantry regiment in the British Army and recruits nationally, it has five Regular battalions and 2 Territorial battalions as well as a raft of Army Cadet Force and Combined Cadet Force detachments and a healthy Veterans' community populated by ex-members of the current and forming regiments. HMS Dauntless Like other livery companies, the Worshipful Company of World Traders has formed an affiliation with a unit of HM Armed Forces. In 2010 arrangements were made with the Admiralty for the Company to \\"adopt\\" HMS Dauntless. 28 (AC) Squadron The Worshipful Company of World Traders is proud of its affiliation with 28 (AC) Squadron which was officially re-formed on 17 July 2001 as home to the Merlin helicopter. After the transfer of the Merlin platform to the Royal Navy, the Sqn was re-branded as a Puma and Chinook Operational Conversion Unit. The Worshipful Company of the World Traders are proud to present an \\"Airman of the Year\\" award which is voted for by Sqn members; the Airman of the Year for 2018 is A/Sgt Bolt.

Estimated to have lived sometime between 6th century to 2nd century BCE, little is known about his life.Oliver Leaman (1999), Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, , page 269J Ganeri (2012), The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness, and the First-Person Stance, Oxford University Press, His traditional name \\"Kanada\\" means \\"atom eater\\", and he is known for developing the foundations of an atomistic approach to physics and philosophy in the Sanskrit text Vai≈õe·π£ika S≈´tra.\\"The Vaisesika sutras of Kanada. Translated by Nandalal Sinha\\" Full Text at archive.org His text is also known as Kanada Sutras, or Aphorisms of Kanada.Kak, S. 'Matter and Mind: The Vaisheshika Sutra of Kanada' (2016), Mount Meru Publishing, Mississauga, Ontario, . The school founded by Kanada explains the creation and existence of the universe by proposing an atomistic theory, applying logic and realism, and is one of the earliest known systematic realist ontology in human history. Kanada suggested that everything can be subdivided, but this subdivision cannot go on forever, and there must be smallest entities (parmanu) that cannot be divided, that are eternal, that aggregate in different ways to yield complex substances and bodies with unique identity, a process that involves heat, and this is the basis for all material existence. He used these ideas with the concept of Atman (soul, Self) to develop a non-theistic means to moksha. If viewed from the prism of physics, his ideas imply a clear role for the observer as independent of the system being studied. Kanada's ideas were influential on other schools of Hinduism, and over its history became closely associated with the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. Kanada's system speaks of six properties (padƒÅrthas) that are nameable and knowable. He claims that these are sufficient to describe everything in the universe, including observers. These six categories are dravya (substance), guna (quality), karman (motion), samanya (universal), visesa (particular), and samavaya (inherence). There are nine classes of substances (dravya), some of which are atomic, some non-atomic, and others that are all-pervasive. The ideas of Kanada span a wide range of fields, and they influenced not only philosophy, but possibly scholars in other fields such as Charaka who wrote a medical text that has survived as Charaka Samhita. Date The century in which Kanada lived is unclear and have been a subject of a long debate. In his review of 1961, Riepe states Kanada lived sometime before 300 CE, but convincing evidence to firmly put him in a certain century remains elusive. The Vaisheshika Sutras mention competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa, but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th century BCE. The Vaisheshika Sutras manuscript has survived into the modern era in multiple versions and the discovery of newer manuscripts in different parts of India by Thakur in 1957 and Jambuvijayaji in 1961, followed by critical edition studies, suggest that the text attributed to Kanada was systematized and finalized sometime between 200 BCE and the start of the common era, with the possibility that its key doctrines may be much older. Multiple Hindu texts dated to the 1st and 2nd century CE, such as the Mahavibhasa and Jnanaprasthana from the Kushan Empire, quote and comment on Kanada's doctrines. His ideas are also mentioned in Buddhist texts attributed to A≈õvagho·π£a of the same period. In Jainism literature, he is referred to as Sad-uluka, which means \\"the Uluka who propounded the doctrine of six categories\\". His Vaisheshika philosophy similarly appears with alternate names, such as \\"Aulukya philosophy\\" derived from the nickname Uluka (literally owl, or grain eater in the night). Kanada was influential in Indian philosophies, and he appears in various texts by alternate names such as Kashyapa, Uluka, Kananda, Kanabhuk among others. Ideas Physics is central to Ka·πáƒÅda‚Äôs assertion that all that is knowable is based on motion. His ascribing centrality to physics in the understanding of the universe also follows from his invariance principles. For example, he says that the atom must be spherical since it should be the same in all dimensions.Kak, S. Ka·πáƒÅda, Great Physicist and Sage of Antiquity He asserts that all substances are composed of four types of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless. Kanada presents his work within a larger moral framework by defining Dharma as that which brings about material progress and highest good., Quote: \\"Kanada's Vaisesikasutra: dharma is that from which prosperity and the highest good come about.\\" He follows this Sutra with another that asserts that the Vedas have gained respect because they teach such Dharma, and something is not Dharma simply because it is in the Vedas. Kanada and early Vaisheshika scholars focused on the evolution of the universe by law. However, this was not unusual for his times since several major early versions of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa along with sub-schools of Yoga and Vedanta, as well as non-Vedic schools such as Jainism and Buddhism, were similarly non-theistic. Kanada was among the sages of India who believed in man's potential to understand existence and reach moksha on his own, without God, a notion of ancient Indians summarized by Nietzsche as the belief that \\"with piety and knowledge of the Veda, nothing is impossible\\". The text states:The Vaisheshika sutras of Kanada, 2nd Edition, Translator: Nandalal Sinha (1923); Editor: BD Basu; Note: this is the translation of non-critical edition of the manuscript * There are nine constituents of realities: four classes of atoms (earth, water, light and air), space (akasha), time (kƒÅla), direction (disha), infinity of souls (Atman), mind (manas).O'Flaherty, p. 3. * Every object of creation is made of atoms (paramƒÅ·πáu) which in turn connect with each other to form molecules (a·πáu). Atoms are eternal, and their combinations constitute the empirical material world. * Individual souls are eternal and pervade material body for a time. * There are six categories (padƒÅrtha) of experience ‚Äî substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence. Several traits of substances (dravya) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes.Vitsaxis, Vassilis. Thought and Faith: Comparative Philosophical and Religious Concepts in Ancient Greece, India, and Christianity. Somerset Hall Pr 2009-10-01 (October 2009). P. 299. . Thus the idea of subdivision is carried further to analytical categories as well, which explains its affinity with Nyaya.

Observations and theories In the fifth chapter of Vaisheshika Sutra, Kanada mentions various empirical observations and natural phenomena such as the falling of objects to ground, rising of fire and heat upwards, the growth of grass upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, the movement towards a magnet among many others, asks why these things happen, then attempts to integrate his observations with his theories on atoms, molecules and their interaction. He classifies observed events into two: those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object conjunctions.The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada, pp. 152-166, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)John Wells (2009), The Vaisheshika Darshana, Darshana Press, Chapter 5 verses (main and appendix), critical edition His idea of the observer, that is the subject, being different from objective reality is completely consistent with Vedanta, which speaks of the difference between \\"Apara\\" and \\"Para\\" knowledge, where \\"Apara\\" represents normal associational knowledge whereas \\"Para\\" represents deeper subjective knowledge. The concept of anu (atom) Kanada proposes that paramanu (atom) is an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it is a state at which no measurement can be attributed. He used invariance arguments to determine properties of the atoms. He also stated that anu can have two states ‚Äî absolute rest and a state of motion. Adherents of the school of philosophy founded by Kanada considered the atom to be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects invisible to the naked eye which come into being and vanish in an instant. Vaiseshikas further held that atoms of same substance combined with each other to produce dvyanuka (diatomic molecules) and tryanuka (triatomic molecules). Kanada also put forward the idea that atoms could be combined in various ways to produce chemical changes in presence of other factors such as heat. He gave blackening of earthen pot and ripening of fruit as examples of this phenomenon.Kapoor, Subodh. The Indian Encyclopaedia, Volume 1. Cosmo Publications. P. 5643. . Kanada postulated four different kinds of atoms: two with mass, and two without. Each substance is supposed to consist of all four kinds of atoms. Kanada's conception of the atom was likely independent from the similar concept among the ancient Greeks, because of the differences between the theories. For example, Kanada suggested that atoms as building blocks differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, while Greeks suggested that atoms differed only quantitatively but not qualitatively.

A band-limited signal is one whose Fourier transform or spectral density has bounded support. A bandlimited signal may be either random (stochastic) or non-random (deterministic). In general, infinitely many terms are required in a continuous Fourier series representation of a signal, but if a finite number of Fourier series terms can be calculated from that signal, that signal is considered to be band-limited. Sampling bandlimited signals A bandlimited signal can be fully reconstructed from its samples, provided that the sampling rate exceeds twice the maximum frequency in the bandlimited signal. This minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate. This result, usually attributed to Nyquist and Shannon, is known as the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem. An example of a simple deterministic bandlimited signal is a sinusoid of the form x(t) = \\\\sin(2 \\\\pi ft + \\\\theta) \\\\ . If this signal is sampled at a rate f_s =\\\\frac{1}{T} > 2f so that we have the samples x(nT) \\\\ , for all integers n, we can recover x(t) \\\\ completely from these samples. Similarly, sums of sinusoids with different frequencies and phases are also bandlimited to the highest of their frequencies. The signal whose Fourier transform is shown in the figure is also bandlimited. Suppose x(t)\\\\ is a signal whose Fourier transform is X(f)\\\\ , the magnitude of which is shown in the figure. The highest frequency component in x(t)\\\\ is B \\\\ . As a result, the Nyquist rate is : R_N = 2B \\\\, or twice the highest frequency component in the signal, as shown in the figure. According to the sampling theorem, it is possible to reconstruct x(t)\\\\ completely and exactly using the samples : x[n] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ x(nT) = x \\\\left( { n \\\\over f_s } \\\\right) for all integers n \\\\, and T \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ { 1 \\\\over f_s } as long as :f_s > R_N \\\\, The reconstruction of a signal from its samples can be accomplished using the Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula. Bandlimited versus timelimited A bandlimited signal cannot be also timelimited. More precisely, a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have finite support unless it is identically zero. This fact can be proved using complex analysis and properties of the Fourier transform. Proof: Assume that a signal f(t) which has finite support in both domains and is not identically zero exists. Let's sample it faster than the Nyquist frequency, and compute respective Fourier transform FT(f) = F_1(w) and discrete-time Fourier transform DTFT(f) = F_2(w). According to properties of DTFT, F_2(w) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} F_1(w+n f_x) , where f_x is the frequency used for discretization. If f is bandlimited, F_1 is zero outside of a certain interval, so with large enough f_x , F_2 will be zero in some intervals too, since individual supports of F_1 in sum of F_2 won't overlap. According to DTFT definition, F_2 is a sum of trigonometric functions, and since f(t) is time-limited, this sum will be finite, so F_2 will be actually a trigonometric polynomial. All trigonometric polynomials are holomorphic on a whole complex plane, and there is a simple theorem in complex analysis that says that all zeros of non-constant holomorphic function are isolated. But this contradicts our earlier finding that F_2 has intervals full of zeros, because points in such intervals are not isolated. Thus the only time- and bandwidth-limited signal is a constant zero. One important consequence of this result is that it is impossible to generate a truly bandlimited signal in any real-world situation, because a bandlimited signal would require infinite time to transmit. All real-world signals are, by necessity, timelimited, which means that they cannot be bandlimited. Nevertheless, the concept of a bandlimited signal is a useful idealization for theoretical and analytical purposes. Furthermore, it is possible to approximate a bandlimited signal to any arbitrary level of accuracy desired. A similar relationship between duration in time and bandwidth in frequency also forms the mathematical basis for the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. In that setting, the \\"width\\" of the time domain and frequency domain functions are evaluated with a variance-like measure. Quantitatively, the uncertainty principle imposes the following condition on any real waveform: : W_B T_D \\\\ge 1 where :W_B is a (suitably chosen) measure of bandwidth (in hertz), and :T_D is a (suitably chosen) measure of time duration (in seconds). In time‚Äìfrequency analysis, these limits are known as the Gabor limit, and are interpreted as a limit on the simultaneous time‚Äìfrequency resolution one may achieve.

Dutton edition of Gentle Ben by Walt Morey Gentle Ben is a bear character created by author Walt Morey and first introduced in a 1965 children's novel, Gentle Ben. The original novel told the story of the friendship between a large male bear named Ben and a boy named Mark. The story provided the basis for the 1967 film Gentle Giant (1967), the popular late 1960s U.S. television series Gentle Ben, a 1980s animated cartoon and two early 2000s made-for-TV movies. 1965 children's novel Gentle Ben Walt Morey, a filbert farmer and former boxer, had previously written many pulp fiction stories for adults dealing with subjects such as boxing, the Old West, and outdoor adventures, published in magazines such as Argosy. However, due to the decline in demand for pulp fiction caused by the advent of broadcast television in the 1950s, Morey stopped writing for ten years. His wife, a schoolteacher, challenged him to write adventure stories that would interest young readers, similar to those of Jack London. After several years, Morey took up her challenge with the goal of producing an adventure story for young readers that adults could also enjoy. The result was Gentle Ben, which was based on Morey's own past experiences working and traveling in Alaska. Morey said that many of the book characters were based on real Alaskan people he had met. According to Morey, the concept of a boy's friendship with an Alaskan brown bear was also taken from real life, and such friendships and interactions between humans and bears were not unusual in Alaska. Originally published in 1965 by E.P. Dutton, the novel was a success, selling nearly 3 million copies. As an unpublished draft it won the Dutton Animal Book Award resulting in its publication. Quote: Walt's books have twice won the Dutton Junior Animal Book Award. Morey won the Dutton prize a second time in 1968 for K√§vik the Wolf Dog. Morey went on to write many more children's novels, often involving themes of nature, animals and survival, but is perhaps best known for Gentle Ben.  Synopsis of the novel  Mark Andersen is a young teenage boy who lives in Alaska with his fisherman father and mother, Karl and Ellen Andersen. Mark is lonely after the death of his older brother, and befriends an Alaskan brown bear named Ben that was captured as a cub by local drunkard Fog Benson. Ben, now a large adult bear, spends his days chained alone in a shack on Benson's property, and the lonely bear bonds with the lonely boy who secretly visits him. Mark's parents are initially upset that he visits Ben, but eventually see that Mark and Ben have a special friendship and buy Ben from Fog Benson for Mark, on the condition that Mark help his father with the fishing to pay him back. However, Fog Benson and his friends attack Ben and Ben fights back, injuring Fog. The townspeople, who generally regard brown bears as wild and unpredictable, now think that Ben is dangerous, and Mark is forced to abandon Ben on an island, where Ben is still menaced by Fog Benson and hunters. Soon afterwards, Karl's fishing boat is destroyed in a storm, so he takes a job minding a fish trap on the island where Ben is living, which leads to Mark and Ben renewing their friendship. Then Ben helps a wealthy businessman and trophy hunter visiting the island, Peter King, who is trapped under a rock. Ben gently rolls the rock off him. The grateful King pays a local guide to protect Ben and ends up going into business with Karl Andersen, so Ben will be safe and the Andersen's financial fortunes are greatly improved.  Memorial statue  An tall (life size) carved wooden statue of Gentle Ben the bear stands in Walt Morey Park in Wilsonville, Oregon, a bear- themed park created on land that previously belonged to the Morey family. In 2012, the Gentle Ben statue was stolen from the park by local teens and dumped in a roadside ditch. It was later found and returned to the park. 1967 film Gentle Giant 1960s television series Gentle Ben Clint Howard as \\"Mark Wedloe\\" with Bruno the Bear as \\"Ben\\" in 1967 The CBS television series Gentle Ben premiered September 10, 1967 and ran until August 31, 1969, airing a total of 58 episodes in two seasons. The series chronicled the adventures of young Mark Wedloe (played by Clint Howard) and his lovable black bear named Ben. Gentle Ben was produced by Ivan Tors, who also produced the Gentle Giant pilot film. Tors was an established producer of successful TV series, including Lloyd Bridges' Sea Hunt, Flipper and Daktari. Like the Gentle Giant film, the TV series Gentle Ben was set in Florida (allowing Tors to use his own studio facilities there) rather than Alaska, and Ben was a large black bear instead of the brown bear of the original novel. The TV series picked up the story where Gentle Giant left off, with Mark's father Tom Wedloe already a wildlife officer in the Everglades, and Ben an adult bear and established family pet living outside (or sometimes inside) the Wedloes' house.  Cast of the TV series  The TV series had few regular characters, consisting of the Wedloe family and their friend and neighbor Henry Boomhauer. Clint Howard and Dennis Weaver continued their roles from the Gentle Giant film. The role of Ellen Wedloe, played in Gentle Giant by Vera Miles, was recast for the TV series with Beth Brickell. The Boomhauer character appeared in several of the episodes and was played by Clint's real-life father Rance Howard (who also wrote episodes for the show). Other recurring characters included Hank Minegar, a squatter played by Robertson White (who had a different small role in Gentle Giant) and Willie, a friend of Mark's, played by Angelo Rutherford. Although several black bears were used to play Ben, depending on what behavior was required for a particular scene, the role was played primarily by Bruno the Bear (who also played adult Ben in the Gentle Giant film). Musician and voice actor Candy Candido provided the voice of Ben. Although the network wanted to have Ben speak like a human on the show, Tors disliked the idea, so Ben made only animal noises. Notable guest stars included Burt Reynolds, Jay Silverheels, Strother Martin, Slim Pickens, Victor French, and Clint Howard's brother Ron Howard. Bears in the TV series Ralph Helfer's Africa U.S.A. animal ranch provided Bruno and other bears (as well as other animals) used in the series. The bears were obtained from Canada or near the Canada-U.S. border because those bears' coats were thicker and more photogenic than those of bears located further south in the U.S. The bears were declawed and had most of their teeth removed. Helfer stated that four bears were used to portray Ben, with other sources naming or listing additional bears, who may have been used in particular scenes or as stand-in bears. Some episodes and sequences also involved bear cubs or other bear characters that may have required additional bears. Bruno was the favorite bear actor because of his good disposition, broad range of behaviors, facial expressions, and ability to work with children. A bear named Buck, who closely resembled Bruno but was a slightly smaller, younger and more agile bear, was used for scenes requiring the bear to run. According to Clint Howard, Bruno the bear and Buck the bear together did approximately 75 percent of the bear acting work. A bear named Drum frequently appeared in scenes requiring the bear to enter water. Drum's coat was brown and had to be spray-painted to match the black coats of the other bears playing Ben. In the 1980s, Dennis Weaver recalled that a bear named Hammer, who occasionally misbehaved on the set, was used for bear scenes involving water. Other bears reportedly used included Smokey, Oscar, Baron, Tudor, Virgil, and a bear (identity unknown, possibly Hammer) with a tendency to fight who was used for bear fight scenes. Bear trainer Tuffy Truesdell, who owned nine bears including the elder and younger Victor the Wrestling Bear, also claimed that his bears did \\"most of the stand-in work\\" for the TV series. According to most sources, the primary bear trainers and bear handlers who did most of the day-to-day bear work on the series were head bear trainer Monty Cox (who said that he was hired after \\"Ben\\" had \\"chewed up\\" a previous bear trainer), and Vern Debord. Other animal trainers involved in the series included Ron Oxley and Steve Martin. Derrick Rosaire Sr. and Pat Derby have also claimed involvement, although it is not clear whether they worked on the TV series or just on the Gentle Giant pilot film. Bruno and some of the other bears were trained using \\"affection training\\", which stressed establishing a respectful bond between animal and trainer, rather than using punishment or food rewards. However, food rewards were used to motivate at least one bear who responded better to that method. Bruno reportedly lived with Cox in a Miami apartment, sometimes even following him into the shower and sleeping in his bed. During and after the run of the TV series, the name \\"Ben\\" or \\"Gentle Ben\\" was used to refer to a number of bears who had appeared in the show. Bruno's name was changed to \\"Ben\\" while he was appearing in the series; it was changed back to \\"Bruno\\" after the show ended. Oxley and Martin made personal appearances at fairs and events with a bear (often Drum) billed as \\"Gentle Ben.\\" In the late 1960s and 1970s, Rosaire Sr. appeared with the Emmett Kelly Circus and elsewhere with a trained bear he called \\"Gentle Ben\\" that purportedly played the role. Rosaire Sr., his son and grandson have said over the years that this bear was a female bear who played both Ben's mother and Ben in the Gentle Giant film. (Ben's mother never appears in the TV series as she is killed at the beginning of the film, and the TV series takes place after the events of the film.) Tuffy Truesdell also trained a wrestling brown bear known as \\"Gentleman Ben\\" and occasionally called \\"Gentle Ben\\" or \\"Ben\\", who wrestled in at least 80 matches for various promotions in the late 1960s and 1970s. Although Truesdell claimed that his bears did work on the TV series, there is no evidence linking the particular bear he called \\"Gentleman Ben\\" to the TV show, particularly since the show used black bears rather than brown bears. After the Gentle Ben series ended, Bruno moved back to California with trainer Ron Oxley and continued his acting career, making a well-received appearance in the 1972 film The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean with Paul Newman. Bruno reportedly died in 1980 or 1981. Buck entertained visitors for many years at the Homosassa Springs Attraction in Florida (now part of Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park). Hammer retired from acting in 1969 and became the first black bear at the Dreher Park Zoo (later renamed the Palm Beach Zoo) in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he lived for almost 20 years. Derrick Rosaire Sr. continued to exhibit his bear named \\"Gentle Ben\\" throughout the 1970s. The fate of the other bear actors involved in Gentle Ben and the Gentle Giant pilot film is not currently known. Although the bear character in a subsequent television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, was also named \\"Ben\\", that character was played by a grizzly bear rather than a black bear, and the show, character and bear actor had no connection to Gentle Ben, except for trainer Steve Martin supplying some animals (including a \\"backup\\" grizzly named Grizz) to the Grizzly Adams show. Production Gentle Ben was filmed in Florida at the Ivan Tors Studios (now Greenwich Studios) in North Miami and at various locations in the surrounding area, including Homosassa Springs and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. The bears, who were from the northern United States or Canada and thus used to colder temperatures, had trouble adjusting to the warm climate. Following a severe flood that caused major damage to Africa U.S.A. in January 1969, the bears working on the show were relocated permanently to Homosassa Springs, where the Ivan Tors Animal Actor Training School was then operating. Writers for the series included Roswell Rogers, Earl Hamner, Jr., Tam Spiva, Rance Howard, Gilbert Ralston, and Frank Telford. Many of the plots focused on themes relating to Tom Wedloe's work as a wildlife officer, such as animal management, lost children, disasters such as hurricanes or fires, and poaching or other illegal activities taking place in Wedloe's jurisdiction. In addition to Ben, other animals were frequently featured. A recurring plot device involved a stranger encountering Ben for the first time and being terrified, until Mark explained that Ben was not dangerous. In the series, Tom Wedloe often traveled the Everglades via airboat and Jeep, while Henry Boomhauer drove a swamp buggy. The airboat, with the characters of Tom, Mark, Ellen, and Ben the bear riding it, was prominently featured in the show's opening credits. Dennis Weaver later recounted an incident where one of the bear actors, Hammer, capsized the airboat. According to trainer Monty Cox, Ivan Tors once expressed concern that when Bruno the bear walked away from the camera, his testicles were visible in some shots, and asked if Cox could somehow tape them up so they would be out of camera view. Cox refused. Several people involved with the series, including Cox, have confirmed that the bears used in the production were sometimes ill-tempered or did not behave as expected, and that working with them could be dangerous. On one occasion, Bruno the bear sat on Clint Howard. According to Dennis Weaver, during the run of the show, the cast and crew were forbidden to publicly mention any incidents of bear misbehavior. However, Clint Howard has stated that he never suffered any injuries from the bears on the show, and that his only injury came from working with a raccoon that had not been declawed.  Reception  Gentle Ben was a hit, reaching a position of #2 in the Nielsen ratings during its first season. A number of TV tie-in products were marketed, including children's books (by authors other than Walt Morey), a board game and a pull- string talking \\"Gentle Ben\\" plush bear by Mattel, a lunchbox, and an album of songs sung by the cast members entitled The Stars of \\"Gentle Ben\\": The Bear Facts. Dell Comics produced a Gentle Ben comic book, featuring photo covers of the TV show actors, that ran for five issues in 1968. However, in its second season, Gentle Ben failed to consistently make the top 20 and was cancelled. Its decline in popularity has been attributed to its young target audience growing older and losing interest in animal shows, and also to its timeslot forcing it to compete with Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color for its target audience. A letter-writing campaign to save the show (even read into the Congressional Record) resulted in 2600 letters being sent to the network, but was not successful. In spite of its short lifespan and cancellation, the show continued to run regularly in syndication, including outside the United States. Personal appearances by \\"Gentle Ben\\" at circuses and events continued to be popular into the 1970s. In October 1969, after the cancellation of the show, \\"Gentle Ben\\" the bear even received a personalized invitation from Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. to a celebrity party in Fort Lauderdale.  Controversy over portrayal of bears  Although the show was praised for promoting respect for nature and family values, it also drew criticism for its unrealistic portrayal of a wild bear's interaction with humans. Some critics noted that the show premiered only a few weeks after the well-publicized Glacier National Park, Montana fatal grizzly bear attacks of August 13, 1967, when two female campers were killed by grizzly bears, in separate incidents and locations, on the same night. When the show debuted, PTA Magazine complained that \\"[f]or years, there have been warnings to children and adults against feeding and playing with bears...How CBS could permit a program with a black bear for a pet‚Äînot a cub either‚Äîbut a gigantic adult bear‚Äîis beyond our comprehension.\\" In 1971, John Hast, the chief National Park Service officer, stated that \\"[t]he television series 'Gentle Ben' was the worst thing that ever happened to us. People saw this big lovable bear on television and when they see a bear in the park I guess they think it's the same one. They don't realize how wrong they are until they're bleeding.\\" Sweden also refused to broadcast the show due to concerns that children would be influenced to play and interact with the wild bears indigenous to that country.

The sequence has been mentioned in several compilations of funniest moments from the long-running show. * In the \\"Rangeboy\\" episode of The Adventures of Pete & Pete children's television series (Season 1, episode 4, originally broadcast on December 19, 1993), Big Pete refers to a (probably) fictional Gentle Ben episode, where Ben saves a blind kid from a mineshaft. He refers to Ben as a positive character in order to persuade his father to wear a bear costume while he is occupied as a rangeboy at his father's golf club.

It was originally produced in 1965 in Japan as by Minoru Adachi and animation company Japan Tele-Cartoons. It was sold outside Japan via K. Fujita Associates Inc., with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Television handling worldwide distribution of the English-language version. The series was distributed in syndication in the United States starting in 1966. Series The show revolves around a talented boy who is further enhanced by some sophisticated inventions. With these, he serves with the underwater policing agency, the Ocean Patrol, in making Earth's oceans safe. The series is set in the future, when humankind has pioneered the world's oceans, establishing great facilities for undersea ranching (episode 4, 17, 22), mineral and oil exploitation (ep. 2, 12), research (ep. 6, 7), and some underocean communities (ep. 10, 15). In this era there is an ocean-based government agency: The Ocean Patrol, whose mission includes protecting all in the sea from danger (episode 4). Most of the activity we witness of the OP is that of policing the world's oceans, for this affluent frontier and its resources seems to have produced a startling number of megalomaniacs‚Äîit seems hardly a week goes by in which the Ocean Patrol doesn't divert someone with an impressive private military force from taking over the world. That being the case, the Ocean Patrol is also an impressive military force with small and large subs, war ships, and an air force (ep. 5, 18). The military branch of the OP includes researchers and scientists who are constantly developing their defensive and offensive arsenal (ep. 9, 10, 17, 19) as well as new research vehicles (ep. 10, 12) and devices (ep. 13). Key people in this department are Marine Boy's father, Dr. Mariner, as well as the brilliant Professor Fumble. However, there are non-military branches of the Ocean Patrol which conduct some of the aforementioned ranching, research, oil drilling and so on. The series follows the Ocean Patrol's patrol boat P-1. The patrol boats are small submarine craft, comfortably sized to be manned by 3 or 4 people. They are also capable of flight for limited times using retractable wings (episode 4, 27). Patrol boats may be heavily armed, most commonly with small \\"rocket torpedoes,\\" but optional weaponry is sometimes mounted. These have included a heat beam, boxing glove missiles (ep. 4), smoke screen (ep. 4, 14), a heavy saw, sonic cannon (ep. 9), a steel net (ep. 11), power claws, drill and laser beam guns (ep. 28). The crew of the P-1 includes Bolton and Piper (a double act, reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy) and often the Ocean Patrol member Marine Boy. Marine Boy is an extremely intelligent, strong and athletic boy of perhaps 13 to 15 years of age. He is a martial artist (episode 1, 2, 8, 16), football player (ep. 17), and an accomplished pilot (ep. 10) whose talents are further enhanced by the inventions of his father, Dr. Mariner. He has a great affinity with sea life, most particularly with a white dolphin he calls Splasher who Marine Boy occasionally seems able to communicate with quite clearly (ep. 11, 12, 17, 28). (MB also wears a ring with a dolphin-calling whistle in it (ep. 2, 4, 16).) It is perhaps because of his skills along with his avid insistence to get involved with trouble that his father, along with Professor Fumble, invented for him the red wetsuit which protects and equips Marine Boy, allowing for him to use his talents to perform dangerous duty. With his headstrong personality, he hardly seems able to avoid it. The suit is highly resistant to penetration (ep. 1, 2) (it appears it may be bulletproof) and temperature (ep. 17, 21). The boots have hyper-powered propeller packs built into the heels which are so efficient they can enable Marine Boy to move huge boulders (ep. 3) and break free from metal manacles (ep. 10). When the power units are exhausted Marine Boy has spares in his belt. He also has retractable flippers, released at the click of his heels (ep. 3). The headgear includes a radio transceiver, but most remarkably, there is no breathing apparatus or face shield. Oxygen is supplied through another of Professor Fumble's inventions: \\"oxy-gum\\" which Marine Boy can chew and receive hours of oxygenation. He tends to have to replenish the gum after heavy activity. Presumably the oxy-gum is very limited in production because no other Ocean Patrol officers use it. Marine Boy also carries a weapon: a boomerang made of a hardened alloy. The alloy can cut through many materials and the nimble Marine Boy has even used it to deflect bullets (ep. 24). It folds on a spring so it can be carried in a holster on his left arm. When unfolded and thrown it can generate a powerful electric shock, which has proved to be so disruptive to some electrical systems, it has blown up entire submarines (ep. 14, 16, 28). Marine Boy also has a friend in Neptina, a young (8-12-year-old?) bare-chested mermaid who was always kept decent by her long flowing hair. Neptina wears a magic pearl around her neck, which could be used for various purposes including creating an envelope of protection and deterring dangerous animals (episode 1, 2, 17), as well as working as a crystal ball to see events (ep. 3, 6, 13, 15, 16, 17). She also seems to understand Splasher (ep. 3, 6, 10) and have an innate understanding of sea life (ep. 4). During battle Marine Boy always directs her to safely stay out of harm's way, and Neptina always submits, then almost inevitably ends up saving Marine Boy. However, in spite of all his gadgets, Marine Boy is knocked out several times by the villains. Marine Boy often faints after being attacked with knock-out gas but Marine Boy is also knocked unconscious by robot spiders, red dolphins and mysterious seaweed, to name but a few. He is also frequently kidnapped by the villains but usually rescued by his friends. History The program concept was developed by Terebi Doga, (a.k.a. Japan Tele-Cartoons or JTC), in Japan in 1965, originally known as Dolphin Prince („Éâ„É´„Éï„Ç£„É≥ÁéãÂ≠ê - Dorufin √îji). Produced as a short experimental trial series of only three episodes and filmed in black and white, Dolphin Prince aired on Fuji TV on Sundays at 7:30 pm between 4 April and 18 April 1965. The episodes featured young Dolphin Prince, his mermaid friend Neptuna and Dr. Mariner, with stories entitled \\"Secret Of The Red Vortex\\", \\"Call Of The Sea\\" and \\"Attack Of The Sea- Star People\\". It was a well-received experiment and Terebi Doga prepared to produce a full series follow-up, although this time they decided that their program would be produced in color in order to maximise the potential of the production, both artistically and commercially. Japan had been transmitting some programs in color since 1960, however, not all Japanese studios had converted their operations to color. To complicate matters, not all Japanese networks were interested in buying expensive color film series which were considered vehicles for selling commercial airtime, especially programs aimed primarily at children. Some broadcasters (such as NHK, TBS, NET and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation) had embraced color as the emerging and more engaging format, but others such as Fuji TV were unwilling to buy or co-finance color programming without a guarantee of commercial return or sponsored support. Fuji TV had broadcast the popular color series Jungle Emperor („Ç∏„É£„É≥„Ç∞„É´Â§ßÂ∏ù - Janguru Taitei) in 1965, but this would not have been filmed in color at all without the pre-sale of the series to U.S. distributor NBC Films for broadcast in the United States as Kimba the White Lion (on the NBC Network which, at the time, insisted that it be supplied color programming by its distributors, the network using color as a promotional tool to attract both sponsors and viewers alike). Terebi Doga, wishing to further explore their Dolphin Prince concept via a full color version, returned to Fuji TV, expecting that the network would happily buy an expanded version of their original monochrome pilot series. Fuji, however, declined to buy into the project, happy as they were with the ratings they were achieving with their current Thursday night black and white anime series Harris' Whirlwind („Éè„É™„Çπ„ÅÆÊóãÈ¢® - Harisu no Kaze). Undeterred, Terebi Doga found external sponsorship from the Matsushita Company (later to be known as National Panasonic Matsushita), and sold their new version of Dolphin Prince to rival TBS Network. Character names were altered, (changing 'Dolphin Prince' to 'Marine Kid' and 'Neptuna' to 'Neptina'), characters were added and concepts expanded. In order to distance the new series from the original trial episodes, the series was re-titled Hang On! Marine Kid („Åå„Çì„Å∞„Çå!„Éû„É™„É≥„Ç≠„ÉÉ„Éâ - Ganbare! Marin Kiddo) and aired on Thursdays at 7:00 pm between 6 October and 29 December 1966. Despite Toei Doga's high hopes, the scheduling of Hang On! Marine Kid was a ratings disaster for TBS, slotted as it was directly in opposition to the ever-popular Harris' Whirlwind, which was still airing on Fuji TV at 7:00 pm. Hang On! Marine Kid was cancelled after its first batch of 13 episodes and not renewed. Despite its cancellation, Hang On! Marine Kid was promoted for sale by Japanese program seller K. Fujita, who in turn attracted the attention of producer Stanley R. Jaffe representing U.S. distributor Seven Arts Television, which later merged into Warner Bros./Seven Arts. Jaffe expressed interest in re-packaging the existing series and expanding it with newly animated episodes for the English-speaking market, with two provisions. First, the series needed to run for 78 episodes to ensure the program had substantial shelf-life and value for money for stations buying it. Second, it was stipulated that the Japanese-language version could not be aired in Japan before the English-language version had aired first-run in the U.S. and sold to international broadcasters. With the deal agreed to, Terebi Doga launched production again, preparing the elements of both Dolphin Prince, (the three monochrome episodes re-worked and re-shot in color), and the 13 completed episodes of Hang On! Marine Kid for use in the new series, as well as gearing up to producing approximately 65 more new episodes as required to produce the complete 78-episode run. Scripts and storyboards were prepared in both English and Japanese and with a fast turnaround in the production process, the episodes were delivered to Zavala-Riss Productions in the U.S. for English dubbing (the unit that also dubbed Speed Racer, featuring the same voice actor cast). By the end of production, two distinct versions had been produced: \\\\- one for the U.S. and foreign markets which would be known as Marine Boy \\\\- one for Japan as Undersea Boy Marine (Êµ∑Â∫ïÂ∞ëÂπ¥„Éû„É™„É≥ - Kaitei Sh√¥nen Marin). As per the terms of the agreement, Marine Boy was first run as a syndicated program throughout the U.S. and in international markets from late 1967 onwards. The Japanese version of the series was eventually sold to Fuji TV and aired on Mondays at 6 pm between 31 January 1969 and 22 September 1969, with only the first 36 episodes broadcast. It was later bought by Nippon TV, all 78 episodes airing Monday to Friday at 5:00 pm between 11 May to 2 September 1971.

Situated on the South Georgia Ridge, they have a peak elevation above sea level of , and stand in water approximately deep. Temperatures average , rarely climbing above . There is no significant vegetation, but the rocks are covered by the guano of seabirds. The main wildlife found on the islands are the South Georgia shags, prions and wandering albatrosses.  History  The Shag Rocks were discovered by Jose de la Llana in 1762 with the Spanish ship Aurora, and originally named the Aurora Islands, after his ship. They were visited by the Spanish ship San Miguel in 1769, again by the Aurora in 1774, and in 1779 by the Princesa and the Dolores. In 1794 the Auroras were finally mapped by the Spanish corvette Atrevida. However, the Aurora Islands are considered by many to have been a mistaken sighting that was coincidentally near the Shag Rocks, which were known to sealers prior to 1823. They were later rediscovered by James P. Sheffield and given their current name, probably because shags and other seabirds frequent them. They were charted by Discovery Investigations personnel on the William Scoresby in 1927. The first known landing on the islands was made in 1956 when Argentine geologist Mario Giovinetto was lowered from a helicopter to collect rock samples.  Government  The Shag Rocks form part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Before 1985 they came within the Falkland Islands Dependencies. Argentina lays claim to the Shag Rocks and Black Rock. Black Rock and Shag Rocks are on the route from the Falkland Islands to South Georgia Island, on a seamount of Scotia Ridge.

She continued to support the Bougainville landings and bombard targets in the Solomons through December. 1944 After training exercises in the New Hebrides in January 1944, Columbia helped spearhead the attack and occupation of Nissan, one of the Green Islands from 13 to 18 February. Early in March, her group swept along the line between Truk and Kavieng in search of enemy shipping, then covered the assault and occupation of Emirau Island from 17 to 23 March. On 4 April, Columbia sailed from Port Purvis in the Solomon Islands for an overhaul at San Francisco, returning to the Solomons on 24 August. Columbia sortied from Port Purvis on 6 September with the covering force for the landings in the Palaus, and remained off Peleliu to provide gunfire support to forces ashore and protection to assault shipping until her return to Manus on 28 September. She sailed on 6 October, guarding the force which was to seize Dinagat and other islands at the entrance of Leyte Gulf which must be neutralized before the vast Leyte invasion fleet could enter the Gulf. These islands were taken on 17 October, and Columbia sailed on to give gunfire cover to the main landings three days later. But as the landings proceeded, the Japanese fleet sailed south to give battle, and on the night of 24 October, its southern force entered Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. Attacks by motor torpedo boats and destroyers on the Japanese force opened this phase of the decisive battle for Leyte Gulf. Columbia with other cruisers had joined the old battleships and lay in wait. In a classical maneuver, the American ships \\"crossed the T\\" of the Japanese column, and opened heavy gunfire which sank the battleship , and forced the heavily damaged cruiser and other units to retire. Toward dawn, Columbia sped to deliver the final blows which sank destroyer , crippled in earlier attacks. After replenishing at Manus early in November, Columbia returned to Leyte Gulf to protect reinforcement convoys from air attack. In December, operating from Kossol Roads in the Palaus, she covered Army landings on Mindoro, and on 14 December, lost four of her men when a gun misfired during an air attack. These were Columbias first casualties of the war.https://www.usscolumbiacl-56.com/Men_buried_at_sea_Dec_14_1945_first_burial.html  1945  Columbia is attacked by a kamikaze off Lingayen Gulf, 6 January 1945 The kamikaze hits Columbia at 1729. The plane and its bomb penetrated two decks before exploding, killing 13 and wounding 44. On 1 January 1945, Columbia sailed for the landings in Lingayen Gulf and on 6 January, as pre- invasion bombardments were getting underway, Japanese kamikaze attacks began. Columbia suffered a near miss by a kamikaze and was then struck on her port quarter by a second. The plane and its bomb penetrated two decks before exploding, killing 13 (including 3 survivors of the who had been rescued two days earlier after their ship was sunk following a kamikaze attack) and wounding 44 men, putting her aft turrets out of action, and setting the ship afire. Prompt flooding of two magazines prevented further explosions, and impressive damage control measures enabled Columbia to complete her bombardment with her two operative forward turrets, and remain in action to give close support to underwater demolition teams. Ammunition was removed from the after magazines to refill the forward magazines; much of this was done by hand. On the morning of the landings, 9 January, as Columbia lay close inshore and so surrounded by landing craft that she was handicapped in maneuver, she was again struck by a kamikaze, knocking out six gun directors and a gun mount. 24 men were killed and 97 wounded, but short-handed as she was, Columbia again put out fires, repaired damage, and continued her bombardment and fire support. Columbia sailed that night, guarding a group of unloaded transports. Her crew's accomplishments in saving their ship and carrying out their mission without interruption were recognized with the Navy Unit Commendation for this operation. Columbia received emergency repairs at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, and sailed on to an overhaul on the west coast, returning to Leyte on 16 June. Three days later, she sailed for Balikpapan, Borneo, off which she lay from 28 June, guarding minesweeping which preceded the invasion of the island on 1 July. She covered the landing of Australian troops, and gave them gunfire support through the next day, sailing then to join Task Force 95 (TF 95) in its repeated sweeps against Japanese shipping in the East China Sea. At the close of the war, she carried inspection parties to Truk, the important Japanese base bypassed during the war, and carried Army passengers between Guam, Saipan, and Iwo Jima until sailing for home on 31 October. After calling on the west coast, Columbia arrived at Philadelphia on 5 December for overhaul and service training Naval Reserve men until 1 July 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia on 30 November 1946, and sold for scrapping on 18 February 1959. In an odd coincidence, the tug that towed Columbia to the breakers, the Triton, owned by Curtis Bay Towing, was also one of the tugs present at her launching, 18 years earlier. Awards In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, Columbia received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

She was launched on 30 November 1944 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Quincy, Massachusetts; she was sponsored by Mrs. E. G. Meyers; and commissioned on 8 June 1945, Captain Allen Hobbs in command. History As CA-74 30 November 1944-8 May 1959 Joining the Pacific Fleet, Columbus reached Tsingtao, China, on 13 January 1946 for occupation duty. On 1 April, she helped to sink 24 Japanese submarines, prizes of war, and next day sailed for San Pedro, California. For the remainder of the year, she operated in west coast waters, then made a second Far Eastern cruise from 15 January to 12 June 1947. After west coast operations and an overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Columbus cleared Bremerton on 12 April 1948 to join the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at Norfolk, Va., on 19 May. Columbus made two cruises as flagship of Commander-in-Chief, Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, from 13 September 1948 to 15 December 1949 and from 12 June 1950 to 5 October 1951, and one as flagship of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, during parts of NATO Operation Mainbrace from 25 August to 29 September 1952. She cruised in the Mediterranean from October 1952 through January 1953, serving part of that time as flagship of the 6th Fleet. Now flagship of Cruiser Division 6, she returned to the Mediterranean from September 1954 to January 1955. Between deployments, Columbus received necessary overhauls and carried out training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean. Reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, Columbus cleared Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 November 1955 for Long Beach, California, where she arrived on 2 December. Just a month later, on 5 January 1956, she sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, and operated with the 7th Fleet until she returned to Long Beach on 8 July. Columbus made two more cruises to the Far East in 1957 and 1958. During the late summer of 1958, her presence was a reminder of American strength and interest as she patrolled the Taiwan Straits during the crisis brought on by the renewed shelling of the offshore islands by the Chinese communists. In late 1958 she was selected to be converted to carry guided missiles and on 8 May 1959, Columbus entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to begin her conversion to an Albany class guided missile cruiser. As CG-12 USS Columbus in 1963 30 September 1959-31 January 1975 On 30 September 1959, the USS Columbus was retrofitted as an Albany class Guided Missile Cruiser, joining and as the only three ships of this line, and reclassified CG-12. USS Columbus (CG-12) was subsequently recommissioned on 1 December 1962 (following a much shorter conversion period than either Chicago or Albany), though a year and half long work-up and testing of her new weapons system delayed her first deployment to the western Pacific until August 1964. The 1959 Albany-class refit of USS Columbus left CG-12 with the following armaments: * RIM-8 Talos - 2 twin Talos SAM launch systems : Fore: Systems 1 & 2, with one launcher; Aft: Systems 7 & 8, with one launcher * RIM-24 Tartar - 2 twin Tartar SAM launch systems : Starboard: Systems 3 & 5 with MK11 launcher; Port: Systems 4 & 6 with MK11 launcher * Anti-Submarine - 1 eight- tube ASROC system * Torpedoes - 2 triple-tube Mk-32 torpedo systems * two open mount naval guns port and starboard midships Flagship Columbus during her 1968 Mediterranean cruise USS Columbus, CG-12, firing Tartar missile while on deployment to Mediterranean Columbus served as Flagship COMCRUDESFLOT throughout 1966, after assignment to the Atlantic Fleet at the start of that year. From 1966 until 1974, Columbus deployed to the Mediterranean seven times. * September 1966 - March 1967 * January 1968 - July 1968 * December 1968 - May 1969 * 8 October 1969 - 18 March 1970 * 6 September 1970 - 1 March 1971 * 17 May 1972 - 18 October 1972 * 2 November 1973 - 31 May 1974 Unlike the Albany and Chicago, both of which received further upgrades, Columbus did not receive the digital missile fire-control and radar modernizations in 1970 due to cutbacks in the Defense budget. The ship did however, receive a 5-month overhaul of her machinery, and heavy maintenance to her electrical and hull structures to keep her operational for another five years. Upon return from her final Mediterranean deployment on 31 May 1974, she entered port and began preparations for deactivation and decommissioning. After serving for 29.5 years, Columbus was decommissioned on 31 January 1975, stricken from the Navy List on 9 August 1976 and sold for scrapping on 3 October 1977, to Union Minerals & Alloys Corp., and scrapped in Port Newark, NJ.

Anhydrous MgCl2 contains 25.5% elemental magnesium by mass. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan Valley. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available. Structure, preparation, and general properties MgCl2 crystallizes in the cadmium chloride motif, which features octahedral Mg centers. Several hydrates are known with the formula MgCl2(H2O)x, and each loses water at higher temperatures: x = 12 (‚àí16.4 ¬∞C), 8 (‚àí3.4 ¬∞C), 6 (116.7 ¬∞C), 4 (181 ¬∞C), 2 (about 300 ¬∞C).Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . In the hexahydrate, the Mg2+ is also octahedral, but is coordinated to six water ligands.Wells, A. F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. . The thermal dehydration of the hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x (x = 6, 12) does not occur straightforwardly.See notes in Rieke, R. D.; Bales, S. E.; Hudnall, P. M.; Burns, T. P.; Poindexter, G. S. \\"Highly Reactive Magnesium for the Preparation of Grignard Reagents: 1-Norbornane Acid\\", Organic Syntheses, Collected Volume 6, p. 845 (1988). Anhydrous MgCl2 is produced industrially by heating the chloride salt of hexammine complex [Mg(NH3)6]2+. As suggested by the existence of some hydrates, anhydrous MgCl2 is a Lewis acid, although a weak one. In the Dow process, magnesium chloride is regenerated from magnesium hydroxide using hydrochloric acid: : Mg(OH)2(s) + 2 HCl(aq) ‚Üí MgCl2(aq) + 2 H2O(l) It can also be prepared from magnesium carbonate by a similar reaction. Derivatives with tetrahedral Mg2+ are less common. Examples include salts of (N(C2H5)4)2MgCl4 and adducts such as MgCl2(TMEDA).N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, Chemistry of the Elements, Pergamon Press, 1984. Applications Precursor to Mg metal MgCl2 is the main precursor to metallic magnesium. The conversion is effected by electrolysis:Hill, Petrucci, McCreary, Perry, General Chemistry, 4th ed., Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, USA. : MgCl2 ‚Üí Mg + Cl2 This process is practiced on a substantial scale.  Dust and erosion control  Magnesium chloride is one of many substances used for dust control, soil stabilization, and wind erosion mitigation. When magnesium chloride is applied to roads and bare soil areas, both positive and negative performance issues occur which are related to many application factors.https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1043546.pdf Catalyst support Ziegler-Natta catalysts, used commercially to produce polyolefins, contain MgCl2 as a catalyst support. The introduction of MgCl2 supports increases the activity of traditional catalysts and allowed the development of highly stereospecific catalysts for the production of polypropylene.  Ice control  Picture of truck applying liquid de-icer (magnesium chloride) to city streetsPicture of solid form of rock salt used for ice removal on streets Magnesium chloride is used for low-temperature de- icing of highways, sidewalks, and parking lots. When highways are treacherous due to icy conditions, magnesium chloride helps to prevent the ice bond, allowing snow plows to clear the roads more efficiently. Magnesium chloride is used in three ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; prewetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that it sticks to the road; and pretreating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads. Calcium chloride damages concrete twice as fast as magnesium chloride.Jain, J., Olek, J., Janusz, A., and Jozwiak-Niedzwiedzka, D., \\"Effects of Deicing Salt Solutions on Physical Properties of Pavement Concretes\\", Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 2290, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C., 2012, pp. 69-75. . It should be noticed that the amount of magnesium chloride is supposed to be controlled when it is used for de-icing as it may cause pollution to the environment.  Nutrition and medicine  Magnesium chloride is used in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical preparations.  Cuisine  Magnesium chloride (E511) is an important coagulant used in the preparation of tofu from soy milk. In Japan it is sold as nigari („Å´„Åå„Çä, derived from the Japanese word for \\"bitter\\"), a white powder produced from seawater after the sodium chloride has been removed, and the water evaporated. In China, it is called lushui (Âç§Ê∞¥). Nigari or lushui consists mostly of magnesium chloride, with some magnesium sulphate and other trace elements. It is also an ingredient in baby formula milk.  Gardening and horticulture  Because magnesium is a mobile nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively used as a substitute for magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. The recommended dose of magnesium chloride is smaller than the recommended dose of magnesium sulfate (20 g/l). This is due primarily to the chlorine present in magnesium chloride, which can easily reach toxic levels if over-applied or applied too often. It has been found that higher concentrations of magnesium in tomato and some pepper plants can make them more susceptible to disease caused by infection of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, since magnesium is essential for bacterial growth. Occurrence alt=Mass fractions of various salt ions in seawater Magnesium values in natural seawater are between 1250 and 1350 mg/l, around 3.7% of the total seawater mineral content. Dead Sea minerals contain a significantly higher magnesium chloride ratio, 50.8%. Carbonates and calcium are essential for all growth of corals, coralline algae, clams, and invertebrates. Magnesium can be depleted by mangrove plants and the use of excessive limewater or by going beyond natural calcium, alkalinity, and pH values.  Toxicology  Magnesium ions are bitter-tasting, and magnesium chloride solutions are bitter in varying degrees, depending on the concentration of magnesium. Magnesium toxicity from magnesium salts is rare in healthy individuals with a normal diet, because excess magnesium is readily excreted in urine by the kidneys. A few cases of oral magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If a large amount of magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to magnesium sulfate, causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.  Plant toxicity  Chloride (Cl‚àí) and magnesium (Mg2+) are both essential nutrients important for normal plant growth. Too much of either nutrient may harm a plant, although foliar chloride concentrations are more strongly related with foliar damage than magnesium. High concentrations of MgCl2 ions in the soil may be toxic or change water relationships such that the plant cannot easily accumulate water and nutrients. Once inside the plant, chloride moves through the water-conducting system and accumulates at the margins of leaves or needles, where dieback occurs first. Leaves are weakened or killed, which can lead to the death of the tree. Locomotive boiler problem The presence of dissolved magnesium chloride in the well water (bore water) used in locomotive boilers on the Trans-Australian Railway caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era. At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent freshwater watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available, and locomotive boilers were lasting less than a quarter of the time normally expected. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load was water for the engine. The line's operator, Commonwealth Railways, was an early adopter of the diesel-electric locomotive.

From 1975, Clackmannan (from the Gaelic Clach Mhanainn, 'Stone of Manau') was the name of a small town and local government district in the Central region of Scotland, corresponding to the traditional county of Clackmannanshire, which was Scotland's smallest. The town of Clackmannan, in which the 'Stone' - a prehistoric monolith of probable cultic significance in the Iron Age - remains, was the chief settlement of its area from the Middle Ages (if not earlier), until supplanted from the second half of the 18th century by the growing manufacturing town of Alloa, on the north shore of the Firth of Forth. The medieval castle of Clackmannan Tower (Historic Scotland) stands above the town and is a landmark visible for many miles around. Dating from the 14th century, though much altered, the Tower is at present not open to the public, having been rendered dangerous by subsidence due to coal-mining (view from exterior). The Stone of ManauSite Record for Clackmannan, King Robert's Stone Clackmannan StoneDetails Details stands by the mercat cross and the surviving tower and west gable of the former burgh tolbooth (built late 17th century) in the centre of the old town. Manau or Manaw was the name of the surrounding district in the Dark Ages. The Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 transferred the name to a unitary authority with the same boundaries, but the authority has subsequently re-adopted the traditional name of Clackmannanshire. Bruce family of Clackmannan Sir Thomas Bruce 1st Baron of Clackmannan was a member of the House of Bruce and received lands in Clackmannan from his cousin Robert II Archaeological Excavation Headland ArchaeologySite Record for Garlet House The GarletDetails Details has recently completed an excavation of a prehistoric and medieval site at Meadowend Farm, Kennet. The site, which lies to the south-east of Clackmannan, is within the corridor for the new road and bridge across the River Forth at Kincardine. Over 2000 fragments of prehistoric pottery were recovered from the site. The vast majority came from a dense concentration of pits or postholes and has been dated to the middle/late Neolithic. A small polished stone axe was found in the area of the Neolithic pit concentration. A larger unpolished axe (c.150 mm in length) was recovered from a pit elsewhere on site. The majority of the pottery consisted of fragments, but one near complete vessel was excavated. The pottery showed a wide variety of incised and impressed decoration. There was also a number of shallow hearths in the area but no clear contemporary structures were identified on site. At least 9 structures were identified on site. The most substantial of these was a large roundhouse with an outer ring- groove and an entrance to the south-east with an extended porch. Inside was a stone-lined hearth, and numerous pits and postholes. Many of these were rich in charcoal suggesting the structure may have burnt down. Prehistoric pottery has been recovered from the postholes dating to the middle/late Bronze Age. Two other ring-groove structures found on site were very heavily truncated. Two large post-built roundhouses were found, both with long porches, one with an entrance to the south-east, the other to the north-west. A third post-built structure contained a hearth-pit, which had been filled with fire-cracked stones and charcoal. It is hoped that radiocarbon dating will enable more precise phasing of the structures.

It was founded in 1991 and elected into the Riksdag in the 1991 Swedish general election. It lost all its seats in the Riksdag in the subsequent election in 1994, and its subsequent decline culminated in bankruptcy in February 2000, at which time it retained only one city council post. Local factions of New Democracy reformed into minor parties such as Sj√∂bopartiet, which faced mixed success. New Democracy campaigned on an agenda of reform and restricted immigration, initially on economic rather than cultural grounds. Its economic policy, stressing the importance of entrepreneurship and deregulation, was generally perceived as right-wing. The party favored Swedish application for European Union membership, which was attained in 1995. It also called for wide-scale political reform, including cutting government departments, reducing the Riksdag to 151 members and electing Prime Minister by direct ballot. These years were the only time a right-wing populist party had been represented in the Riksdag until the election of members of the Sweden Democrats in September 2010. History Foundation Before New Democracy was formed, both founders Bert Karlsson and Ian Wachtmeister were well known in Sweden as charismatic public figures; Karlsson a self-made man, founder, owner and manager of both a record company and an amusement park; and Count Wachtmeister a businessman and from a highly esteemed aristocratic family.Rydgren, 2006, pp. 30‚Äì31.Hannerz, 2006, p. 271. They had also been noted for some limited non-partisan political activity. They had planned starting a party for a short time, as they met for the first time in mid-November 1990 in a caf√© at the Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, waiting for a flight. There, they discussed the matter after Wachtmeister had read in Expressen that Karlsson had \\"appointed\\" him prime minister in his dream-team government.Rydgren, 2006, p. 30. Appearing on television on 23 November, a specially commissioned Sifo poll was announced where 23% of voters had responded that they could imagine voting for \\"Bert Karlsson's party\\". Thus, the party had been secured popular support as well as media attention already before it had been formed. Karlsson and Wachtmeister announced the formation of their new party in an article in Dagens Nyheter on 25 November 1990, titled \\"Here is our party program\\" (H√§r √§r v√•rt partiprogram).Rydgren, 2006, p. 31. The party was given the name New Democracy on 1 December 1990, and was formally incepted at a meeting in Skara on 4 February 1991 after having collected the required number of signatures for official registration. A few days after the party was launched, the party received 11.7% in an opinion poll in Dagens Industri (which apparently had been manipulated by Karlsson), and again the same in a poll in March by Sifo. It held its first party conference on 1‚Äì2 June the same year. The first big setback for the party came when Karlsson appeared on the television program Magasinet. During the show, he was incapable of answering the occasional complex political questions thrown at him by the host, and failed to explain how they sought to implement the party's political program. Karlsson in turn soon resigned as party leader. In the Riksdag (1991‚Äì1994) The party ran an election-show which was totally unconventional in Swedish politics. Wachtmeister and Karlsson for instance became known for illustrating their economic arguments by piling up empty beer crates. They popularly became known as \\"The Count and the Valet\\", noting their contrasting backgrounds. In the summer of 1991, some opinion polls showed more than 10% support for the party. During an election-night television program, Bengt Westerberg, leader of the Liberal People's Party, left the studio in protest against New Democracy's immigration policy. Alf Svensson of the Christian Democrats and Olof Johansson of the Centre Party followed shortly after. In the 1991 general election, the party won 6.7% of the vote and 25 seats. In the Riksdag, New Democracy abstained from voting on the office of Prime Minister, and thus gave the four- party liberal-conservative government led by Carl Bildt its indirect support. While Karlsson would appear in the chamber in inappropriate attire, Wachtmeister engaged more willfully in politics. The two, however, soon fell out, likely due to their contradictory perspectives.Hannerz, 2006, pp. 271‚Äì272. By 1992, it became more clear that the party chose to campaign on a line of criticism of immigration; for instance demanding a decreased foreign aid, expulsion of immigrants committing crime, loans rather than grants and temporary residence permits instead of asylum. The party also started to disintegrate as a result of defections from the parliamentary group, exclusions, peculiar statements in the media, scandals and internal strife. In the summer of 1993, the party's rising star Vivianne Franz√©n started to talk about immigrant rape and Muslim ritual murders. By October 1993 the division between Karlsson and Wachtmeister became clearer, while the party's support had fallen to around 4.4%. When Wachtmeister stepped down as chairman in February 1994, he was followed by an almost unprecedented power struggle. While Wachtmeister launched Sten Dybeck as a new chairman, Karlsson proposed Pelle Svensson and Carl Hamilton. In April, Harriet Colliander was chosen as new chairman instead, just to be followed by Wachtmeister's new candidate Vivianne Franz√©n in June. As the party had depended heavily on its two founders, it began to implode immediately after they started to disagree. In early 1994, the party started to initiate cooperation with parties such as the Sweden Democrats, the Sj√∂bo Party and the Centre Democrats. Downfall (1994‚Äì2000) In 1997, the party leader John Bouvin released his book Riksdagen kan dra √•t helvete (\\"The Riksdag can go to Hell\\"). By the next election, the party had largely become the subject of ridicule.Hannerz, 2006, p. 272. The 1994 general election became a huge failure for the party, as it received only 1.4% of the vote and lost all its seats. The municipal elections also saw its local support shredded, where its former 335 representatives dropped to 53. Already before the election, many local chapters of the party had broken out from the party, and established new local parties. The organization became marked by internal power struggles over the control of party funds, and it quickly fell into dismay (at least at a national level). Bert Karlsson established the local party Skara Future (Skara Framtid) in 1995, and Ian Wachtmeister went on to found a party called the New Party (Det Nya Partiet) for the 1998 elections. Burned by the experience of New Democracy, Wachtmeister hand-picked the board, and the party did not have any conventions or accept any members. The party failed to attract enough votes for representation in the Riksdag and was dissolved. The 1998 elections saw New Democracy losing all but one of its municipal representatives. The party ceased to exist when it was declared bankrupt on 25 February 2000. Laholm city council representative Elver √Ökesson retained his seat until the 2002 elections, the last active member of the party to hold office. \\"New Democracy\\" was founded again in April 2002 under a new organisational registration, and attempted to run for the 2002 elections, but received a mere 106 votes nationwide. The party's website was shut down in March 2005. Ideology Unlike other right-wing populist parties, New Democracy saw economic issues as superior and more important than cultural issues.Rydgren, 2006, p. 50. In its introduction, the party program asserted that it would always base its policies on common sense, personal liberty and consideration for others. The 1991 election survey found that the party's voters was motivated foremost by its position on immigration issues and its economic policy, two issues that were growing in importance at the time.Rydgren, 2006, pp. 33‚Äì34. In addition, twice as many people as actually voted for the party, nevertheless approved of its asylum policies.Rydgren, 2006, p. 34. Taxes The party set out a plan to reduce the overall taxation in Sweden from 57% (which it was in 1989), to 47% within six years, as it cited the average overall taxation in the OECD countries to be 37% the same time. It sought to reduce public expenses, sell state-owned properties and abolish state monopolies. The party competed with the Moderate Party on how steep tax cuts should be, and sought to \\"outbid\\" them.Rydgren, 2006, p. 51. Foreign policy The party saw it as \\"obvious\\" for Sweden to join the European Union, and wanted to relinquish Sweden's policy of neutrality. It wanted Sweden's foreign policy to mainly concern itself with relations with Sweden's \\"real neighbours,\\" which it regarded to be; Denmark, Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland and Russia, as well as its trading partners in Europe and North America. It also wanted to stop foreign aid to oppressive regimes, particularly socialist ones, and instead give aid for humanitarian efforts and emergency aid, as it wanted to \\"help people, not governments.\\" Law and order The party wanted to invest heavily in the fight against drug abuse and street violence, and impose severe penalties for what it called related \\"gangster activity.\\" It wanted to implement harder punishments for violent crime, and life imprisonment for the most dangerous criminals. Immigration The party's anti-immigration stance was largely argued on economic terms, most often by comparing immigration costs and tax-cuts, although welfare chauvinism also sometimes was an element.Rydgren, 2006, p. 52. The party wanted to introduce temporary residence permits for refugees, and that those who were allowed to stay should immediately be assimilated into Swedish society. It wished to set refugees to work, rather than in camps, and to reject foreign citizens who committed serious crimes. Compared to other right-wing populist parties, issues of culture and ethnicity were heavily downplayed. Although downplayed, in a 1991 interview Wachtmeister accused African refugees of having introduced AIDS to Sweden, and expressed displeasure about the lower share of \\"ethnic citizens\\" (ethnic Swedes) compared to other Western countries.Rydgren, 2006, p. 54. The party's anti-immigration stance escalated during its term in the Riksdag. In the party's 1993 summer camp, Vivianne Franz√©n (who became party leader in 1994) described a murder committed by a mentally ill immigrant as a Muslim ritual murder, and also warned that Swedish school children soon would have to turn towards Mecca. International relations Although typically compared to the parties, New Democracy officially distanced itself from both the right- wing populist Danish Progress Party and the Norwegian Progress Party.Rydgren, 2006, p. 45.

The northeastern part of the massif stretches also into the canton of Bern (BE). The Diablerets massif, which consists of several peaks, extends for about 10 kilometres near the western extremity of the Bernese Alps, between the two deep passes, the Cheville Pass () right below the main summit to the south, and the Sanetsch/S√©nin Pass () to the east. The mountain is covered by two distinct glaciers, the largest being the Tsanfleuron Glacier and the highest being the Diablerets Glacier. The main summit (officially referred to as Sommet des Diablerets) is the highest point in the canton of Vaud. In the latter canton, the mountain has given its name to the nearby village and resort of Les Diablerets, which lies on the north side of the massif. On the south side (Valais) the mountain overlooks the hamlet and valley of Derborence. Description The Diablerets massif from the north including the Oldehore (left), the Scex Rouge (centre) and the main summit (right) The main summit from the southeast side Along with the Muverans, the Wildhorn and the Wildstrubel, the Diablerets are one of the four distinct and glaciated massifs of the Bernese Alps that lie between the Rhone elbow and the Gemmi Pass. The main section of the mountain, between the cantons of Vaud and Valais, is part of the Rhone basin, through the rivers Grande Eau (north) and Lizerne (south). The easternmost part of the massif, that lies in the canton of Bern, is part of the Rhine basin, through the river Sarine (French, Saane in German). The Oldehore (Swiss German, Germanized: Oldenhorn) is the tripoint of the three cantons of Vaud, Valais and Bern, and several of the peaks have a German as well as a French name. The main peaks of the massif are, from west to east: the Culan (VD, ) at the western end of the massif, the T√™te Ronde (VD, ) approximately 800 meters west of the main summit, the Sommet des Diablerets (main summit), Le D√¥me (VS, ) east of the main summit and between the two glaciers, the Sex Rouge (also called Scex Rouge; VD, ) and the Oldehorn/Becca d'Audon (VD, BE, VS; ) across the Tsanfleuron Glacier, and the Sentschore/Mont Brun (BE, VS; ) further to the northeast. Also notable is the tower-like peak of the Quille du Diable (\\"devil's skittle,\\" also known as Tour St-Martin; VS, ) that overlooks Derborence from the edge of the Tsanfleuron plateau. The two largest glaciers on the massif (Tsanfleuron and Diablerets) are both on the Valais side. They form a single inclined plane towards the east, although they are separated by the rocky summit of Le D√¥me (2,986 m), which lies just east of the main summit. They are not very steep, especially the Tsanfleuron Glacier, as the rock strata are close to horizontal. The smaller and higher Diablerets Glacier, however, is much wilder than the Tsanfleuron Glacier as it is steeper and more crevassed. The Tsanfleuron plateau, between Le D√¥me and the Sanetsch Pass is only partly glaciated. Below 2,600 m is a large karst zone, called Lapis de Tsanfleuron and covering an area of about . Along with the Culan, the T√™te Ronde, and the Scex Rouge, the main summit forms an amphitheatre of limestone cliffs with numerous water falls, surrounding the valley of Creux de Champ and overlooking the village of Les Diablerets from a height of over 2,000 metres. The height of the north wall is about 1,600 metres, its bottom (named Rochers de Champ) lying at 1,600 metres. As with other mountains on the crest of the Bernese Alps, the slopes of the Diablerets experience different types of climate depending on their location:This results in different colors of the vegetation, which can be seen on satellite images such as those available on Google Earth (2015 imagery) the northern slopes are cooler and wetter while the southern slopes are drier and warmer. Forests are found up to 1,900 metres on the north side and up to 2,000 metres on the south side. Further south in Valais, on the slopes of Mont Gond, vineyards are also very common below 1000 metres, but completely absent on the north side. There, alpine pastures dominate the landscape, as in many other areas of the northern Alpine foothills. Tourism and climbing Since 1964, an aerial tramway connects the Scex Rouge from the Col du Pillon, 4 kilometres east of the village of Les Diablerets. The Tsanfleuron Glacier, easily accessible from the Scex Rouge mountain station, has then become part of a large ski area with several ski lifts on it, culminating at nearly 3,000 metres, that goes by the commercial name of Glacier 3000. The area is also popular in summer for the snow hikes on the glacier. The summits of Le D√¥me and Oldenhorn can be reached in a few hours from the station. The Peak Walk, a 107m suspension bridge to Scex Rouge from the peak at the top of the lift station, was constructed as a tourist attraction in 2014. The main summit, although not very distant from the Scex Rouge station, can not be easily reached as it involves the crossing of the much-crevassed Diablerets Glacier, though it is accessible to more intrepid hikers. Administratively, le Sommet des Diablerets is shared between the municipalities of Conthey (VS), Ormont- Dessus and Bex (VD).

The main text in the middle is the text of the Talmud itself. To the right, on the inner margin of the page, is Rashi's commentary; to the left, on the outer margin, the Tosafot The Tosafot, Tosafos or Tosfot () are medieval commentaries on the Talmud. They take the form of critical and explanatory glosses, printed, in almost all Talmud editions, on the outer margin and opposite Rashi's notes. The authors of the Tosafot are known as Tosafists ( Ba'ale haTosafot); for a listing see List of Tosafists. Meaning of name The word tosafos literally means \\"additions\\". The reason for the title is a matter of dispute among modern schoars. Many of them, including Heinrich Graetz, think the glosses are so-called as additions to Rashi's commentary on the Talmud. In fact, the period of the Tosafot began immediately after Rashi had written his commentary; the first tosafists were Rashi's sons-in-law and grandsons, and the Tosafot consist mainly of strictures on Rashi's commentary. Others, especially Isaac Hirsch Weiss, object that many tosafot ‚Äî particularly those of Isaiah di Trani ‚Äî have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that tosafot means additions to the Talmud, that is to say, they are an extension and development of the Talmud. For just as the Gemara is a critical and analytical commentary on the Mishnah, so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term tosafot was not applied for the first time to the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the Tosefta, the additions to the Mishnah compiled by Judah ha-Nasi I. Tosefta is a Babylonian term, which in Jerusalem writings is replaced by tosafot.See Yer. Pe'ah ii. 17a; Lev. R. xxx. 2; Cant. R. vi. 9; Eccl. R. v. 8. The Tosafot resemble the Gemara in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body. Character Up to and including Rashi, the Talmudic commentators occupied themselves only with the plain meaning (\\"pesha·π≠\\") of the text; but after the beginning of the twelfth century the spirit of criticism took possession of the teachers of the Talmud. Thus some of Rashi's continuators, as his sons-in-law and his grandson Samuel ben Me√Ør (RaSHBaM), while they wrote commentaries on the Talmud after the manner of Rashi's, wrote also glosses on it in a style peculiar to themselves. The Tosafot do not constitute a continuous commentary, but rather (like the \\"Dissensiones\\" to the Roman Code of the first quarter of the twelfth century) deal only with difficult passages of the Talmud. Single sentences are explained by quotations which are taken from other Talmudic treatises and which seem at first glance to have no connection with the sentences in question. On the other hand, sentences which seem to be related and interdependent are separated and embodied in different treatises. The Tosafot can be understood only by those who are well advanced in the study of the Talmud, for the most entangled discussions are treated as though they were simple. Glosses explaining the meaning of a word or containing a grammatical observation are very rare. The Tosafot may be considered from the point of view of a methodology of the Talmud. The rules are certainly not gathered together in one series, as they are, for instance, in Maimonides' introduction to the Mishnah; they are scattered in various parts, and their number is quite considerable. Neither are they stated in fixed terms; a generally accepted rule is followed by \\"This is the way of the Talmud\\" or \\"The Talmud usually declares.\\" Sometimes the negative expression is found, \\"This is not the way of the Talmud.\\" A frequently recurring rule is indicated by some such formula as \\"We find many like this.\\" The above description concerns the general features of the Tosafot; nevertheless, the writings of different tosafists differ somewhat in style and method. With regard to method, it should be said that the Tosafot of Touques (see below) concern particularly the casuistic interpretation of the traditional law, but do not touch halakhic decisions. In spite of the great respect in which Rashi was held by the Tosafists, the latter freely disputed his explanations. History The chief home of tosafot literature was incontestably France, for it began with Rashi's pupils, and was continued mainly by the heads of the French schools. While tosafot began to be written in Germany at the same time as in France, the French tosafists always predominated numerically. The first tosafot recorded are those written by Rashi's two sons-in-law, Me√Ør b. Samuel of Ramerupt (RaM) and Judah ben Nathan (RIBaN), and by a certain R. Joseph.Jacob Tam, \\"Sefer ha-Yashar,\\" No. 252; \\"Haggahot Mordechai,\\" Sanhedrin, No. 696; see below But their tosafot not being otherwise known, the actual father of the tosafot in France was undoubtedly Jacob b. Meir, known colloquially as Rabbeinu Tam, whose style was adopted by his successors. He wrote a great number of tosafot, many of which are to be found in his \\"Sefer ha-Yashar\\"; but not all, as many passages that are cited in the edited tosafot are not found in the work just mentioned. In Germany, at the same time, flourished Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi (RIBA), leader of the German tosafists, who wrote numerous tosafot, which are mentioned by Abraham ben David,\\"Temim De'im,\\" Nos. 158, 207-209 and which are very often cited in the edited tosafot.e.g., to So·π≠ah 17b But Isaac ben Asher's tosafot were revised by his pupils, who, according to Rabbeinu Tam,\\"Sefer ha-Yashar,\\" No. 282 sometimes ascribed to their teacher opinions which were not his. Zedekiah ben Abraham,\\"Shibbolei HaLeket,\\" 1:225 however, refutes Rabbeinu Tam's assertion. The most prominent tosafist immediately after Rabbeinu Tam was his pupil and relative Isaac ben Samuel ha-Za·∏≥en (RI) of Dampierre, whose tosafot form a part of the Tosafot Yeshanim (see below). Isaac was succeeded by his pupil Samson ben Abraham of Sens (R\\"SH) (d. about 1235), who, besides enriching the literature with his own compositions, revised those of his predecessors, especially his teacher's, and compiled them into the group known as the Tosafot of Sens. Samson's fellow pupil Judah b. Isaac of Paris (Sir Leon) was also very active; he wrote tosafot to several Talmudic treatises, of which those to Berakhot were published at Warsaw (1863); some of those to 'Abodah Zarah are extant in manuscript. Among the many French tosafists deserving special mention was Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise (Sir Morel), who, owing to the destruction of the Talmud in France in his time, relied for the text entirely upon his memory.Meir of Rothenburg, Responsa, No. 250 The edited tosafot owe their existence particularly to Samson of Sens and to the following French tosafists of the thirteenth century: (1) Moses of √âvreux, (2) Eliezer of Touques, and (3) Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil. It has been said that the first German tosafist, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, was the head of a school, and that his pupils, besides composing tosafot of their own, revised his. In the thirteenth century the German schools were represented by Baruch ben Isaac, in Regensburg, and later by Meir of Rothenburg (MaHaRaM); the Italian school was represented by Isaiah di Trani. If the tosafot of Asher b. Jehiel (RoSH) (d. 1328) are to be included, the tosafistic period extended through more than two centuries. When the fanaticism of the French monasteries and the bigotry of Louis IX brought about the destruction of the Talmud, the writing of tosafot in France soon ceased. Overview Each generation of Tosafists would add to the compiled glosses, and therefore there are many different versions of the Tosafot. In addition, each compilation of the Tosafos did not contain everything that was said by the Tosafists on the subject so compilations will differ in what they say. Therefore, some things that were said by the Tosafists will be found only in obscure versions of the Tosafot. Publication The final version of these commentaries was published on the outer side of the pages of the Soncino edition of the Talmud, printed in Soncino, Italy (16th century), and was the first printed edition of the full Talmud. The publisher of that edition was a nephew of Rabbi Moshe of Spires (Shapiro) who was of the last generation of Tosafists and who initiated a project of writing a final compilation of the Tosafos. Before he published his Talmud he traveled throughout France to the schools where the Tosafists learned and gathered all of the different manuscripts of that final version of the Tosafos and printed them in his Talmud. Since then every publication of the Talmud was printed with the Tosafos on the outer side of the page (the inner side has the commentary of Rashi) and is an integral part of the study of the Talmud. The burning of the Talmud During the period of the Tosafists the church enacted a law that prohibited possession of the Talmud under pain of death and 24 wagon loads of scrolls of the Talmud were gathered from all of France and burned in the center of Paris. The intention of the church was that the study of the Talmud should be forgotten and once forgotten it would remain forgotten for all generations since there would be nobody to teach it. As a result, the Tosafists devised a system where they could study the Talmud without the existence of a text despite the vastness of the Talmud. They appointed scholars, each to be expert in one the volumes of the Talmud, to know it by heart and very well, and so through these scholars they would have expertise and knowledge in all of the Talmud. As they would study a particular text in one volume of the Talmud those scholars who were expert in different volumes of the Talmud would tell of anything in the volume of the Talmud that they were expert on that would contradict their understanding of the text at hand. Thus an important aspect of the scholarship of the Tosafists is to use texts in different areas of the Talmud to disprove certain interpretations of the Talmud (often those of Rashi) and to determine the correct way to understand the Talmud. Authorities cited The Tosafot quote principally Rashi (very often under the designation \\"·∏≥on·π≠res\\" [= \\"pamphlet\\", Rashi initially published his commentary in pamphlets]), many of the ancient authorities (as Kalonymus of Lucca, Nathan b. Jehiel, and R. Hananeel), some contemporary scholars (as Abraham b. David of Posqui√®res, Maimonides, Abraham ibn Ezra, and others), and about 130 German and French Talmudists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Many of the last-named are known as authors of general Talmudic works, as, for instance, Eliezer b. Nathan of Mainz, Judah of Corbeil, and Jacob of Coucy; but many of them are known only through their being quoted in the Tosafot, as in the case of an Eliezer of Sens, a Jacob of Orleans, and many Abrahams and Isaacs. Some are mentioned just once, including Eliezer of \\"Pelire\\" [Falaise? Montpellier?]Tosafot Bava Batra 79b, Ephraim b. DavidSupposed contemporary of Judah Sir Leon; Tosafot 'Abodah Zarah 39a, and one Hezekiah.Tosafot Bava Batra 44b A commentary on the Pentateuch entitled \\"Da'at Ze·∏≥enim\\" (Leghorn, 1783) is attributed to the Tosafists. In form this commentary follows the style of the Tosafot; Rashi is often discussed, and sometimes corrected. Schools of Tosafists Tosafot of Sens The earliest collection, compiled by Samson ben Abraham of Sens. It was one of the main sources for the Tosafot of Touques, which in turn underlies the present printed Tosafot (\\"Tosafot shelanu\\"). Passages from the Tosafot of Sens which did not find their way into the main collection are sometimes printed under the title of Tosafot Yeshanim. Tosafot of √âvreux Moses of √âvreux, one of the most prolific tosafists, furnished glosses to the whole Talmud; they form a distinct group known as the Tosafot of √âvreux. It may be presumed that the \\"Tosafot of R. Moses\\" mentioned by Mordechai ben Hillel\\"Mordechai,\\" on Sanhedrin, No. 937 are identical with the tosafot just mentioned. According to Joseph ColonResponsa, No. 52 and Elijah Mizra·∏•i,\\"Mayim Amukim,\\" 1:37 Moses wrote his glosses on the margin of Isaac Alfasi's \\"Halakhot,\\" probably at the time of the burning of the Talmud. Tosafot of Touques Eliezer of Touques, of the second half of the thirteenth century, made a compendium of the Tosafot of Sens and of √âvreux; this compendium is called the Tosafot of Touques, and forms the basis of the edited tosafot. Eliezer's own glosses, written on the margin, are known as the Tosafot Gillayon or Gilyon Tosafot. It must be premised, however, that the Tosafot of Touques did not remain untouched; they were revised afterward and supplemented by the glosses of later tosafists. Gershon Soncino, who printed these tosafot, declares that his ancestor Moses of F√ºrth, who lived in the middle of the fifteenth century, was a descendant in the fifth generation of Moses of Speyer, who is mentioned in the Tosafot of Touques. It is supposed that the last redactor of these tosafot was a pupil of Samson of Chinon. Tosafot of Perez ben Elijah's Pupils Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil was one of the most active of the later tosafists. Besides supplying tosafot to several treatises, which are quoted by many old authorities and are included among the edited tosafot (and many of which were seen in manuscript by Azulai), he revised those of his predecessors. His pupils were not less active; their additions are known as the Tosafot of Perez b. Elijah's Pupils. Other bodies of tosafot French Tosafot Mentioned in the novellae on Tamid ascribed to Abraham b. David. Zunz\\"Z.G.\\" p. 57 thinks that the Tosafot of Sens may be referred to under this title; but the fact that Abraham b. David was much earlier than Samson of Sens leads to the supposition that the glosses indicated are those of previous tosafists, as Rabbeinu Tam, Isaac b. Asher ha-Levi, and Isaac b. Samuel ha-Za·∏≥en and his son. Pis·∏≥e Tosafot (\\"Decisions of the Tosafot\\") Collection of halakic decisions gathered from the edited tosafot to thirty-six treatises‚ÄîNazir and Me'ilah being excepted‚Äîand generally printed in the margin of the Tosafot; in the later editions of the Talmud, after the text. These decisions number 5,931; of these 2,009 belong to the tractateBerakot and the order Mo'ed; 1,398 to Niddah and the order Nashim; 1,503 to Nezi·∏≥in; and 1,021 to ·∏≤odashim. The decisions contained in the tosafot to Shabbat, Pesa·∏•im, Gi·π≠·π≠in, Ketubot, Baba ·∏≤amma, Baba Me·∫ìi'a, Baba Batra, and ·∏§ullin number fully one-half of those recognized as authoritative. The compiler of these decisions can not be identified with certainty; Asher b. Jehiel, his son Jacob b. Asher, and Ezekiel, uncle of Eliezer of Touques, are given by different authorities. Jacob Nordhausen, also, is known to have compiled tosafot decisions; in fact, references to two groups of Pis·∏≥e Tosafot are found in the works of the later commentators. Spanish Tosafot This term is used by Joseph ColonResponsa, No. 72 and by Jacob Baruch Landau\\"Agur,\\" ¬ß 327 and may apply to Talmudic novellae by Spanish authors. Jeshuah b. Joseph ha-Levi, for instance, applies the term \\"tosafot\\" to the novellae of Isaac ben Sheshet.\\"Halikhot Olam,\\" ¬ß 327 The Edited Tosafot (called also Our Tosafot) The tosafot which have been published with the text of the Talmud ever since its earliest edition (see Talmud, Editions of). They extend to thirty-eight treatises of the Babylonian Talmud. Most of the treatises are covered by the Tosafot of Touques, some by the Tosafot of Sens; many are provided with the tosafot of various authors, revised by Perez b. Elijah's school. The authorship of the tosafot to seventeen treatises only can be established with certainty: * Berakot: Moses of √âvreux; * Shabbat, 'Erubin, and Mena·∏•ot: the Tosafot of Sens; * Be·∫ìah, Nedarim, Nazir, Sanhedrin, Makkot, and Me'ilah: Perez b. Elijah's school (many written by Perez himself); * Yoma: Me√Ør of Rothenburg; * Gi·π≠·π≠in, Baba ·∏≤amma, and ·∏§ullin: the Tosafot of Touques; * So·π≠ah: Samuel of √âvreux; * 'Avodah Zarah: Samuel of Falaise; * Zeba·∏•im: Baruch b. Isaac of Worms. The tosafot to Mo'ed ·∏≤a·π≠on were written by a pupil of a certain R. Isaac; the author of the tosafot to ·∏§agigah wrote tosafot to other treatises also. Those to Ta'anit belong to the post-tosafot period, and differ in style from those to other treatises. Tosafot Alfasi Quoted by Joseph Colon (Responsa, Nos. 5, 31) and Judah Minz (Responsa, No. 10). The term may designate either the tosafot of Samuel b. Me√Ør and Moses of √âvreux, or glosses to Alfasi's Halakot. Tosafot of Gornish Mentioned by Joseph Solomon DelmedigoNobelot Chochmah, Preface and Solomon Algazi,Gufei Halakhot, No. 195 the latter quoting these tosafot to Bava kamma. But as the same quotation is made by Betzalel AshkenaziShitah Mekubetzet to Bava Kamma and ascribed to a pupil of Perez ben Elijah, AzulaiShem ha-Gedolim, ii. concludes that these tosafot originated in Perez b. Elijah's school. Still, Mordecai ben HillelMordekhai, Bava Batra, No. 886 mentions a R. Judah of Gornish, and Abraham ibn AkraMeharerei Nemerim, Venice, 1599 reproduces Talmudic novellae by \\"M. of Gornish\\" (Embden gives \\"Me√Ør of Gornish\\" in the Latin translation of the catalogue of the Oppenheim Library, No. 667). Manuscript No. 7 of the G√ºnzburg collection bears the superscription \\"Tosafot of Gornish to Yebamot,\\" and in these tosafot French and German rabbis are quoted. Manuscript No. 603 of the same collection contains also the Tosafot of Gornish and novellae by Judah Minz, and fragments of Gornish tosafot are found in manuscripts in other libraries. Different theories have been advanced with regard to the name \\"Gornish.\\" According to S. Schechter,Jew. Chron. May 4, 1888 it is a corruption of \\"Mayence\\", while H. Adler thinks it a corruption of \\"Norwich\\".See A. Neubauer in R. E. J. xvii. 156, and Henri Gross, Gallia Judaica, pp. 136 et seq. Gross (l.c.) thinks that Gornish may be identical with Gournay, in France, and that \\"M. of Gornish,\\" apparently the author of the Tosafot of Gornish, may be Moses of Gornish and identical with the Moses of ◊í◊®◊ô◊ô◊†◊• mentioned in the Tosafot of Sens (to Pesa·∏•im). It may be added that in the supplement to Zacuto's Yu·∏•asinp. 164a, Cracow, 1581 a David of \\"Durnish\\" occurs. Tosafot ·∏§i·∫ìoniyyot (\\"Exterior\\" or \\"Uncanonical Tosafot\\") Tosafot which are neither of Sens nor of Touques. They are so called by Betzalel Ashkenazi; he included many fragments of them in his Shitah Mekubetzet, to Bava Metzia, Nazir, etc. Tosafot Shi·π≠·π≠ah (or Shi·π≠·π≠ah) Name sometimes applied to the recensions of Perez b. Elijah or to the tosafot of Jehiel of Paris.Bezalel Ashkenazi, l.c.; notes to \\"Sha'are Dura,\\" ¬ß 57; and many other authorities Tosafot Yeshanim (\\"Tosafot of the Ancients\\") This group comprises four smaller ones: (1) the general tosafot of Sens, including those appearing among the edited tosafot; (2) the earlier unedited tosafot (for example, those to ·∏≤iddushin by Isaac b. Samuel haZaken of Dampierre, and those to Avodah Zarah by his son Elhanan ben Isaac); these sometimes appear separately under the title of Tosafot ha-Ri; (3) a collection of old tosafot published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf ha-Levi in \\"Sugyot ha-Shas\\" (Berlin, 1736); (4) various tosafot found in ancient manuscripts, as the tosafot to Chullin written in 1360, the manuscript of which is in the Munich Library (No. 236). In the collection published by Joseph Jessel b. Wolf haLevi (No. 3), besides the old tosafot to Yoma by Moses of Coucy,Compare, however, Israel Isserlein, \\"Terumat haDeshen,\\" No. 94, who declares they belong to the Tosafot of Sens there are single tosafot to sixteen treatises‚ÄîShabbat, Rosh HaShanah, Megillah, Gittin, Bava Metzia, Mena·∏•ot, Bechorot, Eruvin, Beitzah, Ketubot, Kiddushin, Nazir, Bava Batra, Horayot, Keritot, and Niddah. In the Vilna edition of the Talmud edited by Romm, the \\"old tosafot\\" to several treatises are printed. Tosafot ha-Rid By Rabbi Isaiah di Trani. Tosafot Hachmei Anglia A small collection of tosafot composed by rabbis from England. Tosafot ha-Rosh A commentary in tosafot style, and largely dependent on the earlier tosafot collections, composed by Asher ben Jehiel. These, together with the Hiddushim of Nahmanides and others, were studied by the Sephardi Jews instead of the normal Tosafot. Bibliography Tosafot collections The Tosafot shelanu are printed in most Talmud editions, in the column farther from the binding. The Vilna edition also includes tosafot from other collections, such as Tosafot Yeshanim, Tosafot ha- Ri and Tosafot ha-Rid on a few tractates. The Piske Tosafot (decisions of the Tosafot) are printed at the end of each tractate. Complete sets of the Tosafot ha-Rosh and the Tosafot of Rabbi Peretz are published separately, as are individual volumes from the Tosafot Yeshanim and a few others. The most recent editions of the Talmud, such as the Friedmann edition published by Oz we- Hadar, incorporate these collections at the back of each volume, in a synoptic fashion. Most of the other collections remain in manuscript or in the form of quotations in later works.

Many archaeological finds from the Iron Age and the Anglo- Saxon period have also been made. Some, such as the 1st-century Desborough Mirror and the Anglo-Saxon Desborough Necklace, are now in the possession of the British Museum.Desborough Heritage Centre Retrieved 18 January 2017. Domesday Book (1086) refers to Desborough as a \\"place of judgement\\". The name itself is thought to have derived from 'Disburg', which meant a sacred and fortified place. In the High Street centrepiece of what is now the Market Square stands a pillar that is called locally the Town Cross, though it is a square column topped by a stone ball. It is thought to have served as a gateway pillar from Harrington Hall. From the 17th century, Desborough developed around the spinning and weaving industries. The town's factories used local wool and flax to produce fine cloth and linen until the mid-19th century. Silk weaving then developed in a Paddock Lane factory and shoe-making also gained importance. The Cross, Desborough Transport Desborough lies five miles (8 km) south-east of Market Harborough, north-west of Kettering, and south-west of Corby. The A6 Rothwell‚ÄìDesborough bypass opened on 14 August 2003. Between 1857 and 1968, Desborough had a railway station, opened and operated by the Midland Railway (later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and, after nationalisation, British Rail). This was part of an extension of its network from Leicester to Bedford and Hitchin, but it was closed under the Beeching cuts. Churches Desborough has an Anglican parish church, St Giles's, along with a Baptist church, a United Reformed Church, and the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity. St Giles's Church is the oldest surviving building in the town, dating from about 1225. It is believed to stand on the site of an earlier Saxon church. Its relics from the town's history include part of an Anglo-Saxon cross carved from stone, a Tudor rood screen, and reminders of the English Civil War. Close by the church is the 18th-century Church House, with stuccoed Doric pillars. This became Desborough House in the 19th century and is now the Services Club. Partnership On 7 September 1969, an Anglican/ Methodist partnership was inaugurated in the presence of the Bishop of Peterborough and the Chairman of the Oxford District. Since then a Methodist minister has been working in partnership with the Anglican vicar. St Giles is part of the Anglican united benefice of Desborough and Brampton Ash with Braybrooke and Dingley. It has regular church festivals, including one of the United Kingdom's largest and longest-running Christmas tree festivals (over 100 trees, held since 1998). The trees are contributed by local organisations, companies, families and individuals. The Kettering Leg of the annual Student Cross pilgrimage to Walsingham starts near Desborough. The Old Manor House The Old Manor House in Gold Street retains features of its late 17th-century origins. Ferdinand Poulton, a Roman Catholic lawyer, was Lord of the Manor and reputedly one of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot conspirators. Government and community Governance of Desborough lies (in descending order) with Northamptonshire County Council, Kettering Borough Council and the local Desborough Town Council. Desborough belongs to the Charter of European Rural Communities, which links it to 27 other EU member towns and villages. It is twinned with Neuville de Poitou in the Vienne department of France and with Bi√®vre in the Walloon region of Belgium.

Co-operative movement With the intention of preventing exploitation of workers by agents and employers, local men founded the Desborough Co-operative Society in 1863. Starting with local shops and then a corset and lingerie factory, the Desborough Co-op once had a department store, a bank, a supermarket, a travel agents, a ladies' shoe and clothing shop and a number of corner stores. After several mergers, the town is now served by the Central England Co-op. Over the years, a number of its functions have ceased, including the bank branch and the ladies' shoe and clothing shop. However, a Co-operative undertakers has opened in one of the former corner shops. The former Co-op Corset Factory, now owned by Wacoal Eveden LtdEveden makes lingerie and swimwear. The site includes the original Victorian factory, and immediately opposite, Eveden's warehousing and UK factory shop. The former Co-operative Society Sports Ground with a football field and tennis courts is now covered by a housing development, Desbeau Park ‚Äì Desbeau being the name of a range of lingerie made at the Corset Factory. Sport and leisure Desborough has a Non-League football team, Desborough Town F.C., which plays at Waterworks Field. The town's leisure complex was built in the later months of 2012. It holds a gym, a caf√©, a football court, a basketball court and an outside skate park. Targetcraft Archers club meets at nearby West Lodge Rural Centre. Desborough Green Space Junior park run takes place there every Sunday morning at the Leisure Centre. Local residents organize a free 2-km run aimed at increasing physical activity and volunteering within the community. Education The town has a primary school-cum-infant/junior school, consisting of Loatlands Primary and combined Havelock Infant and Junior schools. Secondary education takes place outside the town.Secondary schools near Desborough Retrieved 30 October 2017.

The European Science Foundation (ESF) is an association of 9 member organizations devoted to scientific research in 7 European countries. ESF is an independent, non-governmental, non-profit organisation that promotes the highest quality science in Europe. It was established in 1974 and its offices are located in Strasbourg, France (headquarters). ESF Member Organisations are research-performing and research- funding organisations, academies and learned societies across Europe. After 42 years of success in stimulating European research through its networking, ESF undertook a re-alignment and re-calibration of its strategic vision and focus. The launch of its Expert division \\"Science Connect\\" beginning of 2017 marks the next phase of its evolution and has been born out of a deep understanding of the science landscape, funding context and the needs of the research community. More information about the new role of ESF and SCIENCE CONNECT can be found on www.esf.org. Past Activities Up to 2015 ESF provided a platform for research scoping, planning and networking on a European and global scale for ESF member organisations. ESF activities were organised around three operational bases: strategy, synergy and management. In line with its then mission and strategic plan, the European Science Foundation ran programmes in science; programmes to enhance science synergy such as research networking programmes and collaborative research projects for European scientists; along with activities dedicated to science management, such as providing administrative services to independent scientific committees and other organisations. ESF-EUROHORCs - The Funding Gap In June 2008, ESF in collaboration with EUROHORCs (European Heads of Research Councils) published a policy briefing ‚ÄòThe EUROHORCs and ESF Vision on a Globally Competitive ERA and their Road Map for Actions to Help Build it‚Äô,EUROHORCs, ESF commit to play key role in shaping a competitive ERA ESF press release, 25. June 2008 detailing essential requirements to build a globally competitive European Research Area within the next five to ten years. Unfortunately, in 2014 this instrument disappeared from the European landscape and has not been replaced by any other funding mechanism. A change of focus ESF has recently changed its scope of work.http://www.esf.org/esf/european-science-foundation/ ESF has closed its traditional research support activities (European Collaborative Research Projects, Exploratory Workshops, Research Networking Programmes, etc.) and is focused now on supporting the scientific community through scientific-support services delivered by its Expert division Science Connect. Structure ESF is structured as follows: * Governing bodies * Science Connect Division * Community of Experts * Expert Boards Governing bodies The annual assembly is the highest level decision making body of the ESF. It elects the ESF president, the Executive Board, ratifies the budget and accounts and admits new members. The assembly delegates are appointed by ESF member organisations. The Executive Board sets and direct the overall strategy of the ESF and coordinates the relations with EU and other institutions. The Executive Board consists of the ESF president and 3 to 8 member organisations. The Executive Board meets twice a year. The President officially represents the ESF to the public and in relations with other national or international organisations. Currently the ESF president is Martin Hynes. The Chief Executive is responsible for the implementation of the strategy and policy set by the Executive Board, for administration of the ESF office and its finance and for ensuring the execution of the decision of the assembly and the Governing Council. At present the ESF Chief Executive is Dr. Jean-Claude Worms (ex-ESSC Executive Secretary). Science Connect Division Science Connect is ESF's Expert services division dedicated to support scientific decision- making through a range of science-support services, such as Peer Review, Career Tracking, Project Management and Expert Boards Hosting. More information about Science Connect services can be found here. Community of Experts ESF‚Äôs Community of Experts is a quality driven network of international recognized experts that covers the full spectrum of the scientific landscape (Humanities, Economics and Social Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Engineering Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Life and Biomedical Sciences). Its role is to sustain scientific collaboration, support excellence in research grant peer-review and proposal evaluation across all scientific disciplines. ESF‚Äôs Community of Experts comprises 3 colleges: * The College of Review Panel Members. Review Panel Members have a broad expertise in several scientific disciplines and their mission is to build consensus during the evaluation of research proposals. * The College of Expert Reviewers. Expert Reviewers are scientists specialized in a specific scientific domain and are in charge of assessing and evaluating several types of proposals such as fellowship applications and research projects. * The College of Expert Associates. Expert Associates are scientists that support ESF on temporary missions through the identification of scientific peers and the undertaking of quality check of peer-review reports. Expert Boards Since 1974 ESF has set up and hosted expert boards and committees in several scientific domains. These include space sciences; radio- astronomy frequencies; nuclear physics; marine and polar sciences; and materials science. At present ESF hosts the following Expert Boards: European Space Sciences Committee (ESSC) Established in 1974, the ESSC provides unbiased, expert advice to the space scientific community including but not limited to the European Space Agency, the European Commission, EU national space agencies. Over the years, the ESSC has become the reference body in Europe for independent scientific advice on space matters and a key partner for international research collaboration. Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee (NuPECC) NuPECC‚Äôs aim is to strengthen European collaboration in nuclear physics through the definition of a network of complementary facilities within Europe. NuPECC issues recommendations on the development, organisation and support of European nuclear physics and particular projects. Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) Established in 1988, CRAF represents all the major radio astronomical observatories in Europe. CRAF initiates and encourages scientific studies aimed at reducing radio astronomy interference at source and the effects of interference. Throughout the years CRAF has become an active voice in Europe and engages with other groups of radio astronomers in discussions with international organisations that decide on the use of radio spectrum.

Its objective is to minimize, and eventually eliminate, the incidence of genetic disorders common to Jewish people, such as Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. Dor Yeshorim is based in Brooklyn, New York, but has offices in Israel and various other countries.  History  In both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish communities, there is an increased rate of a number of genetic disorders such as Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that goes unnoticed in carriers, but is fatal within the first few years of life in almost all homozygotes. (The exception is the rare adult-onset Tay‚ÄìSachs, which is normally not fatal but is incapacitating.) Orthodox Judaism generally opposes selective abortion. Although preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is often approved by Halakha, it is a difficult and costly process. By avoiding marriages between \\"carriers\\", the incidence of the disorders decreases without having to resort to such methods. Dor Yeshorim was founded in 1983 by rabbi Josef Ekstein in Brooklyn. Its name, meaning \\"upright generation,\\" comes from Psalms 112:2. In a 2006 interview, Ekstein said that while four of his first five children died of Tay-Sachs disease, none of his children born subsequent to the founding of Dor Yeshorim suffered the condition.Leiman, Yehoshua. \\"Trailblazer in Genetics for the Jewish World and Beyond\\". Personal Glimpses, supplement to Hamodia, Pesach 5766 (April 2006), page 24-27. The same interview quotes a New York neurologist who credits the near-total disappearance of the condition from the ultra-orthodox community due to Dor Yeshorim's involvement. In 2005, Dor Yeshorim created a new program for the collection and storing of umbilical cord blood. Called Kehila Cord, the program operates in the US and in Israel. In 2016, Dor Yeshorim received media attention when a rap video of two schoolgirls beat-boxing about their marriage prospects was shared in the Orthodox Jewish community. The organisation claimed to be \\"very disturbed by the whole thing\\" and that \\"...it is below our dignity as an organization to promote such a thing\\". Subsequently, Dor Yeshorim also issued an official statement distancing itself from the video.  Operations  Dor Yeshorim screens only for recessive traits that give rise to lethal or severely debilitating disorders, providing prophylactic, rather than diagnostic services. They do not screen for disorders arising from dominant gene mutations, as these cannot be prevented by informed mate selection.These diagrams, known as Punnett squares, are used to illustrate the method of trait transfer to offspring according to classical Mendelian genetics. In the Punnett square to the left, two heterozygous individuals (carriers) can potentially form three types of offspring: homozygous positive, heterozygous carriers and homozygous negative, in the ratio of 1:2:1. Homozygous positive offspring (highlighted in red) will completely express the particular recessive trait, in this case the genetic disorder. In the Punnett square to the right, a heterozygous carrier individual and a homozygous negative individual can potentially form two types of offspring: heterozgous carriers and homozygous negative, in the ratio of 1:1, and are necessarily unable to produce any affected offspring, barring a new random mutation. It is the situation depicted on the left, in which couples have the potential of producing affected offspring, that Dor Yeshorim attempts to prevent. Dor Yeshorim advocates anonymous testing. Individuals are tested during large sessions in Jewish schools and processed anonymously with only a PIN linking the sample with the candidate. It offers three panels of testing: the original Standard Ashkenazi Panel, the Sephardi/Mizrahi Panel, and the Optional Ashkenazi Panel (offered for an additional fee). Since January 2016, people who indicate that they are of Sephardic descent are automatically tested with both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi panels. The Standard Ashkenazi Panel includes testing for the following diseases: * Tay‚ÄìSachs disease * Familial dysautonomia * Cystic fibrosis * Canavan disease * Glycogen storage disease (type 1) * Fanconi anemia (type C) * Bloom syndrome * Niemann‚ÄìPick disease * Mucolipidosis type IV *Spinal muscular atrophy Dor Yeshorim does not directly tell individuals which diseases they are a carrier for, in order to \\"avoid unnecessary emotional burden\\". When two members of the system contemplate marriage, they contact the organization and enter both their PINs and dates of birth. When both carry a gene for the same disorder, the risk of affected offspring is 25%, and it is considered advisable to discontinue the plans. In the context of shidduchim, the \\"carriership check\\" is often run within the first three dates, to avoid disappointments and heartbreak. In the United States, testing costs range from $225 to $500. One- half of the actual testing costs is subsidized by private donors and governments.  Reception  The system has received praise and criticism from both within as well as outside the community. There has been criticism leveled against the method used by Dor Yeshorim by Moshe Dovid Tendler, a professor of medical ethics at Yeshiva University.Rosen, Christine. \\"Eugenics‚ÄîSacred and Profane\\". The New Atlantis Summer 2003;2:79-89. Online version. > The question arises, when do you stop? There are close to 90 [homozygous] > genes you wouldn‚Äôt want to have. Will this lead to people showing each other > computer print outs of their genetic conditions? We‚Äôll never get married. Tendler feels the system is \\"affirming eugenics\\" which he sees as \\"the idea that Jews are the repository of bad genes\\". Fred Rosner, a professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said that \\"I think Dor Yeshorim performs a tremendous service...screening is a wonderful thing to do, and if you can avoid the birth of a potentially lethally affected child, that is a good thing.\\" Dor Yeshorim has been criticised for withholding patient results, for declining to publish its financial records and for not testing anyone who has already been tested elsewhere, by Geoffrey Alderman, who says that Dor Yeshorim fails some fundamental tests itself. Critics including the Association for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, have described Dor Yeshorim in the UK as a \\"Wedding tax\\". Dor Yeshorim was also criticised for allegedly seeking to convince the Jewish community it must, for ‚Äúreligious reasons,‚Äù use its service, by circulating a letter from Bezalel Rakow. Rakow was a signatory to a subsequent letter stating that \\"Every individual has the privilege to perform the test in a manner consistent with his desires.‚Äù In 2012, the Jewish Chronicle published a letter by a Tay‚ÄìSachs carrier, who was hurt by a Dor Yeshorim organiser's insinuation that there was stigma attached to being a Tay‚ÄìSachs carrier.

Founded in 2004, it received 14% in the European Parliament election of the same year - gaining three seats. In the elections of 2009, however, it saw a drop of 11 percentage points in support and lost all of its seats. It currently holds no seats in parliament and does not play any active role in Swedish politics. The party also ran in the Swedish 2006 parliamentary election, but it only received 0.47% of the votes, far below the 4% needed to get into parliament.  History   Foundation  The party was formed in 2004, in the wake of the Swedish euro referendum held in September 2003, in which the adoption of the euro was rejected. The party's co-founder is Nils Lundgren, a former member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and chief economist of the bank Nordea, who is sceptical of the euro. Lundgren hoped to receive support from eurosceptical voters dissatisfied with their usual parties' positive attitudes towards the euro and further European integration. Among the Swedish parties represented in parliament at the time, only the Left Party, Center Party and the Green Party were eurosceptic, while the Social Democratic Party, the major left-wing party, and all right-wing parties with exception of the Center party were positive towards European integration. Aiming at receiving support from this broad political spectrum, the board of the party contained people that had been previously active in both left- and right-wing parties. The party takes its name from the June Movement in Denmark, which is a eurosceptic party named after the timing of the Danish referendum that rejected the Treaty of Maastricht. The June Movement was also a major source of inspiration for the June List.  2004 European Parliament election  The party succeeded in capturing 14% of the votes in the 2004 European Parliament election, thereby gaining three of the 19 Swedish seats. The three MEPs were Nils Lundgren, former social democrat H√©l√®ne Goudin and former Christian democrat Lars Wohlin. In 2006 Wohlin, left the June List for the Christian Democrats, leaving the party with only two seats. Wohlin stated that he wanted to be able to \\"work for the Christian Democrats and the Alliance for Sweden in the 2006 parliamentary election\\" as reason for leaving the June List. The June List was one of the founding members of the Independence and Democracy group in the European Parliament.  2006 elections  The June List was on the ballot for the 2006 parliamentary elections in Sweden. The party's platform during the election focused on a few main issues: to increase the number of people working in the private sector, hence increasing the state's tax income, a referendum on the European Union constitution and nuclear power, and increased municipal autonomy and more local referendums. All issues that were not in the party's relatively short party program were left to the approximately 100 candidates to decide on. The voters were encouraged to choose to vote for a particular June List candidate that they preferred rather than to cast a general ballot for the party itself. At one point it seemed possible that the party might be able to break the 4% threshold necessary to enter parliament, with the party reaching 4.5% in the polls in September 2005, but after that peak the party's support plummeted well below the 4% barrier and in the months before the election it became clear that the party would not be taking seats in parliament that year. In the end, the party received only 26,072 votes (0.47%).Swedish Election Authority Swedish businessman Sven Hagstr√∂mer, one of the two men who gave his name to the Hagstr√∂mer & Qviberg group of companies, served on the board of the party.  2009 European Parliament election  The June List suffered a significant decline in its support at the 2009 election and lost all of its seats in the European parliament.

Denver launched on 4 April 1942 by New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss L. J. Stapleton, daughter of the Mayor of Denver; and commissioned on 15 October 1942, Captain Robert Carney in command. It was the second ship named for the city of Denver, Colorado. Service history 1943 Denver sailed from Philadelphia on 23 January 1943, and arrived at Efate, New Hebrides on 14 February. Thomas Darden was in command. The new cruiser first saw combat in the bombardment of Vila on Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands, on 6 March. During this action her force engaged and sank the Japanese destroyers and in the Battle of Blackett Strait. Continuing her operations in the Solomons, Denver joined the bombardment of Ballale Island on 29‚Äì30 June in conjunction with the invasion landings on New Georgia, then remained in the area on patrol. On the last day of October 1943, Denver sortied from Port Purvis with Task Force 39 (TF 39) to intercept an enemy force attempting to disrupt the landings at Cape Torokina, Bougainville. In the resulting battle of Empress Augusta Bay on the night of 1/2 November, the American ships sank one enemy light cruiser and a destroyer and damaged two heavy cruisers and two destroyers, while the four other enemy ships broke off the action and retired. During the heavy firing Denver was hit by three shells which fortunately did not explode. She shared in the Navy Unit Commendation awarded her division for its outstanding performance in this battle. Denver covered the support landings on Cape Torokina on 10‚Äì11 November 1943, and two days later during a heavy air attack was hit by an aerial torpedo which knocked out all power and communications and killed 20 of her men. She was towed by to Port Purvis and then by to Espiritu Santo for temporary repairs, then sailed to Mare Island for permanent repairs, arriving on 2 January 1944. 1944 Denver returned to the forward area at Eniwetok, arriving on 22 June. Eight days later, she put to sea to screen carriers as they launched strikes to neutralize Japanese bases in the Bonins and Marianas during the invasion of the Marianas. She bombarded Iwo Jima on 4 July, and after screening continued air assaults returned to Eniwetok on 5 August. Denver sailed from Port Purvis on 6 September for the invasion of the Palaus. She bombarded Angaur Island from 12 to 18 September, then covered a task unit engaged in minesweeping, reconnaissance and underwater demolition operations before the landings on Ulithi on 23 September. She returned to Manus Island on 28 September to prepare for the return to the Philippines. Denver departed on 12 October for the landings on Leyte, bombarding Suluan Island and Dulag to open the vast invasion fleet's way into Leyte Gulf, then sailed on to bombard the southern landing beaches. As the Japanese sent the major portion of their remaining combatant fleet south in a desperate attempt to break up the landings, Denvers group took station in Surigao Strait on 24 October to prevent the passage of the Japanese Southern Force into Leyte Gulf. Attacks were made by motor torpedo boats and destroyers stationed in advance of the battle line. , , and were all that remained of the Japanese ships when Denver and the others of the battle line opened fire at 0351. With three other cruisers, she made a material contribution to the cumulative gunfire which sank Yamashiro. Mogami was later sunk by aircraft, and Shigure was the sole survivor of Nishimura's fleet which had sailed forth for this phase of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf. After this action, Denver sailed to aid in the destruction of any surviving enemy vessels, aiding in sinking early in the day on 25 October. Continuing her service in Leyte Gulf, she fought off numerous attacks; during the one of 28 October, a bomb released from one of the planes she shot down exploded nearby causing minor damage and slight flooding. She screened reinforcement landings in November and fought off a kamikaze attack on 27 November, suffering four men wounded from fragments of a bomb which exploded off the starboard quarter. She joined the heavy covering group, for the Mindoro landings of 13‚Äì16 December, then returned to Manus on 24 December. 1945 Returning to San Pedro Bay on 3 January, Denver sortied the next day to cover the landings at Lingayen Gulf. She remained in the Philippines to join in the consolidation of those islands. She covered the landings on Zambales on 29‚Äì30 January, supported minesweeping near and landings on Grande Island; provided fire support at Nasugbu on 31 January; escorted a replenishment convoy to Mindoro from 1 to 7 February; covered the Army landings around Mariveles Bay from 13 to 16 February, rescuing the survivors of the destroyer ; and supported the operations on Palawan and Mindanao Islands from February to May. On 7 June, Denver sailed from Subic Bay for the amphibious assaults on Brunei Bay, Borneo, and later at Balikpapan. She covered the pre-invasion work of minesweeping units and underwater demolition teams, and provided fire support for the invading troops until returning to San Pedro Bay, Leyte on 4 July for brief overhaul. Denver got underway for Okinawa on 13 July to hunt Japanese shipping off the China coast as part of Task Force 95 until 7 August. She sailed from Okinawa on 9 September to cover the evacuation of men of the Allied forces rescued from prison camps in the Wakayama area and covered the landing of occupation troops at Wakanoura Wan from 25 September to 20 October, when she sailed for home. Denver arrived at Norfolk on 21 November, and after overhaul, reported to Newport, Rhode Island, in January 1946 for duty training men of the Naval Reserve, and a good-will visit to Quebec, Canada. In April, she arrived at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 7 February 1947. Stricken on 1 March 1959, ex-Denver was sold on 4 February 1960 to Union Minerals and Alloy Corp., New York City, for $260,689.89, and broken-up at Kearny, New Jersey, during November 1960.

The hoax was created by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at the gaming magazine Edge, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. They based it on the two concepts dogging and bluejacking that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. The point of the hoax was to \\"highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts\\". Dozens of news organizations, including BBC News, Wired News, and The Independent thought the toothing story was real and printed it. On April 4, 2005, Curran and Byron admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. There have, however, been real Bluetooth dating devices since. Conception Devised by Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson, Bluetooth is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Originally, Bluetooth was only intended for wireless exchanging of files between these devices, but it was later discovered that it could also be used for sexual intentions. The hoax concept of toothing started around March 2004 in the form of a forum designed by Ste Curran, then Editor at Large at games magazine Edge, and ex-journalist Simon Byron. Toothing was conceived as a merger of the two concepts dogging with bluejacking, both of which were frequently mentioned in the UK media around that time. Byron said he and Curran were \\"idly messaging about the Stan Collymore dogging scandal, and how this stupid sexual buzzword had (apparently) come from nowhere,\\" when they came up with the concept. \\"We wondered if we could create our own. We wonder a lot of things, and rarely push them past concept, because we‚Äôre as collectively creative as we are frustratingly idle. This particularly concept was simple enough to outstrip the temptations of grinning, saying 'Yeah!', and wandering off to see what was on [television].\\" Several newspapers have also compared toothing to dogging. In toothing, a Bluetooth device is used to find other Bluetooth enabled devices within a close distance (on trains or buses, for example), and then send the expression \\"toothing?\\" as an initial greeting, letting the person with the enabled Bluetooth device know you are looking for sex. If sending of text messages via Bluetooth is not possible, the Bluetooth name of the mobile phone can be set to \\"toothing?\\" or something else to indicate interest. The pair of hoaxers wrote fake news articles on the forum about toothing and sent them off well-known Internet-based news services. Byron said he had to write \\"Penthouse-letters-page style sexual adventure stories\\" for articles and interviews with the media. The point with hoax was, according to Byron, to \\"highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts.\\" Spread in media The concept of toothing quickly reached a large audience, even in countries outside of the UK. Curran and Byron said they kept a record from the start of all their mentions in the media, \\"but there were soon too many to record in full.\\" They agreed to do an interview with The Daily Telegraph and \\"many papers read that and followed up, broadsheet and tabloid, regional, national, all over the planet.\\" One of the hoaxers made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live, and a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom reportedly declared his interest in toothing as a way of meeting women. The couple also received offers to license official toothing merchandise such as sex lines, websites, and mobile-phone software. Dozens of news organizations, including BBC, Wired News, Infosyncworld, and The Independent fell for the story and printed it. The Guardian also printed the story, but the article's author suspected it to be an April Fools' Day prank. The BBC wrote in their article: > One practitioner is Jon, a \\"Toother\\" living near London. \\"One morning I > received an anonymous text message via bluetooth,\\" he told BBC News. \\"I > didn't understand what had happened, but that evening I did some research > and worked out how to send my own.\\" The pair started to exchange messages on > a train station platform; messages which got gradually more flirty. > \\"Eventually she asked me if I fancied a quickie in the toilets at the > station we were travelling to. \\"It happened, but I never saw her again.\\" > Since that day Jon - who claims to have had Toothing success five times - > has set up a website dedicated to the practice but he admits it takes a > degree of perseverance. Aftermath thumb200pxleftThe toothing hoax has been studied by a sociologist at University of Amsterdam (pictured). On April 4, 2005, the creators of the forum admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. Though the concept of toothing is possible, the hoaxers never intended for it to turn into something real. The couple said: \\"It's like going into a crowded nightclub, throwing a brick at the dance floor with a love letter attached, and hoping that the person it hits will agree to sleep with you.\\" When announcing the hoax, Curran and Byron reassured that toothing was nothing more than a practical joke gone too far and despite all the articles in newspapers and tabloids, \\"no one has ever ever, ever toothed.\\" Shanna Petersen, a sexologist, disagreed with the hoaxers' statement that no-one has ever toothed: \\"It's simple, doesn't take a lot of guts and rejection is nowhere as personal. Of course it's popular. Show people a new way through which they have a chance to have more sex and they'll do it. No matter how much effort goes into it or how meager the results.\\" Multiple forums were in fact created throughout Europe, Asia and America within months of the original post of toothing. People signed up to the forums looking for good locations in their area to tooth, and to share their toothing stories with other members. There have later been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market. University of Bath psychologist Linda Blair said the practice of toothing is down to the human need to take risks: \\"I think we protect ourselves too much in modern society, and risk is a human need. We need motivation. In some ways this is a tame way of picking people up, it's almost a natural follow up from randomly picking people's names out of the phone book. It's voluntary at all stages, and has choice. As long as that's there and it's legal, then people should be able to do what they want.\\" Sue Peters of the Terrence Higgins Trust worried that anonymous sex made possible by toothing would cause an increase of sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia in the United Kingdom. University of Amsterdam sociologist Albert Benschop researched the hoax. He said toothing is \\"the next logical step\\" in dating and that the \\"old game is just adapting to new times\\". Benschop added that toothing is \\"just like picking up people in bars but without the silly time-consuming conventions of decorum that people are obliged to keep to these days. This is much more direct. You both know what you want.\\" He also sees it as a way for people \\"to satisfy their need for intimacy. As long as it helps people out of loneliness and gives them more to enjoy in life, I think it's a very good development.\\" The term \\"toothing\\" was included in the 2006 version of The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English. It was described as an \\"anonymous casual sexual activity with any partner arranged over Bluetooth radio technology enabled mobile phones.\\" In addition, toothing is listed in the Sex Slang dictionary, authored by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor, with an explanation similar to the one in the New Partridge Dictionary. Toothing was referenced in an episode of the American television series CSI: Miami, called \\"Killer Date\\", that aired in the United States on April 18, 2005.

The village lies south of Thornbury and north of Bristol. Alveston is twinned with Courville sur Eure, France. The civil parish also includes the villages of Rudgeway and Earthcott. Prehistory A ritual deposit of bones, dating to about 2000 years ago, has been found in a cave in the village. The remains of at least seven humans have been excavated. At least one skull showed signs that it had been pole-axed and then smashed inwards. An adult human femur had been split lengthwise so that the bone marrow could be scraped out. This finding is evidence of cannibalism, which is also suspected from other Iron Age deposits in Britain. Many bones of dogs, and a few cattle and possibly one bear bone, were also found.Cannibalistic Celts discovered in South Gloucestershire. UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL. Press release issued: 7 March 2001 http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2001/cannibal.html Descent of the manor Domesday Book Domesday Book entry for Alveston The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the following entry for Alveston: . Translated as follows: \\"In Langeley Hundred Earl Harold held Alveston. There were there 10 hides in demesne, 1 plough-team, 23 villeins, 5 bordars for whom there were 22 plough-teams, 2 serfs. There....2 plough-teams, 5 serfs. It returned ¬£12....\\" This was a very large manor, of 35 households in total. As the manor had been held by King Harold Godwinson it was seized into the royal demesne by William the Conqueror and remained in use as a royal hunting park until 1149. Illness of William Rufus Early in March 1093 King William II (1087‚Äì1100) was at the royal manor of Alveston, possibly awaiting his passage across the River Severn to Wales via the Aust ferry. He was suddenly attacked by a serious illness, thought to have been a disorder of the stomach or bowels. He was immediately rushed to Gloucester Castle 25 miles to the north, near which the monks of Gloucester Abbey were relied upon to provide a medical cure. It was believed the illness had been brought on as a result of the king's sinful behaviour and he determined to repent and make amends. This illness contracted at Alveston thus resulted in the issuance of a charter which elaborated the king's coronation pledge, akin to a charter of liberties. He pledged to protect and defend the church, to abolish simony, to abolish unjust laws and deter wrong-doers. He ordered the release of prisoners, remission of debts and all offences against himself he pardoned. He was confined to his chamber for the whole of Lent, covering the period 2 March to 17 April 1093. On 6 March he consented to appoint Anselm Abbot of Bec as Archbishop of Canterbury, which he had previously strongly opposed.Barlow, Frank.

Henry trusted Fulk and valued his services. The grant was a reward for Fulk's loyalty to the cause of Henry's mother the Empress Matilda in the civil war with \\"The Usurper\\" Stephen. Alveston was inherited in 1171 by Fulk's son Fulk II.Pipe Roll, 17 Henry II, p.84 During the Barons' wars of the reign of King John (1199‚Äì1216) which led up to Magna Carta signed in 1215, Fulk II's son and heir Fulk III FitzWarin (died 1258) rebelled and the manor escheated to the crown and passed temporarily into the stewardship of Hugh de Nevill. In 1204 Fulk III regained possession, but on 30 June 1216 King John ordered that Alveston should be seized once again from Fulk III FitzWarin. On 15 January 1230 King Henry III granted the park of Alveston back to Fulk III FitzWarin,Meisel, p.46, quoting Close Rolls, 1:112 (or poss. Calendar of Charter Rolls 1:112) and Fulk is recorded as having incurred a debt of 300 marks for this grantMeisel, p.47, quoting PRO MS E372/74/9r As a royal favour the king pardoned Fulk 200 marks of this debt.Meisel, p.176, note 126, quoting PRO MS E368/16/3r Clearly Fulk was then in royal favour as in June 1234 he received from the king a gift of 3 deer from the royal Forest of Cannock. In September he received 2 bucks and 8 does from the royal Forest of Braden, near Purton, Wiltshire, to help him to stock his deer park at Alveston.Meisel, p.46, quoting Close Rolls, 1231‚Äì34, p.159 In 1236 Fulk was given another 6 does from Braden and 6 more does from the Forest of Selwood, again to help him stock his park at Alveston.Meisel, p.46, quoting Close Rolls 1234‚Äì37, p.237) In November 1246 the king gave Fulk another 6 bucks and 10 does for the same purpose.Meisel, p.46, quoting Close Rolls 1242‚Äì47, p.486 In 1249 Fulk III became involved in a lengthy legal dispute brought against him by Nicholas Poyntz, his near neighbour from Iron Acton who had accused Fulk of expelling him from the common pasture of Tockington, which adjoined Alveston manor.Meisel, p.193, note 73, quoting PRO MS KB 26/136/11r Fulk IV FitzWarin fell at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, loyally supporting King Henry III in his struggle against the barons. He left his son and heir a minor, Fulk V (died 1314). Fulk V was awarded in Wardship, probably by Simon de Montfort, victor of Lewes, to Peter de Montfort (died 1265), \\"The Nemesis of the Marcher Lords\\". He was rescued from this unpleasant position by his warder's death at the Battle of Evesham following which King Henry III re-granted him in wardship to the Fitzwarin's long-time friend Hamo le Strange. In 1273 Fulk V attained his majority of 21 years of age and gained possession of his father's lands including Alveston.Meisel, p.53 Legend of Fouke le Warin The early 14th-century legend, based on a lost 13th-century ancestral romance relates as follows, regarding the donation of Alveston (\\"Alleston\\") to Fulk by King Henry (translated from French):Wright, Thomas (1855) op.cit. pp.59‚Äì61 > \\"King Henry called Fulk, and made him constable of all his host; and placed > under his command all the force of his land, and that he should take people > enough and go to the march, and drive thence Jervard Droyndoun and his power > out of the march. Thus was Fulk made master over all; for he was strong and > courageous. The king remained at Gloucester; for he was ailing, and not in a > condition for labour. Jervard had taken entirely the whole march from > Chester to Worcester, and he had disinherited all the barons of the march. > Sir Fulk, with the king's host, gave many fierce assaults to Jervard ; and > in a battle near Hereford, at Wormeslow, made him fly and quit the field. > But before he fled, many were killed on both sides. Fierce and hard war > between Fulk and the prince lasted four years, until at the request of the > king of France a love-day was taken at Shrewsbury between the king and > Jervard the prince, and they embraced mutually and came to an agreement. And > the prince restored to the barons of the march all the lands which he had > taken from them, and restored Ellesmere to the king; but for no gold would > he render White-Town and Maelor. \\" Fulk,\\" said the king, \\" since you have > lost White-Town and Maelor, I give you instead Alleston and all the honour > which belongs to it, to hold for ever.\\" Fulk thanked him dearly\\".

Ad Quod Damnum, C 143/79/6; Licence: Patent Rolls, 3 Edward II, m.28 Walter was Sheriff of Somerset & Dorset 1293‚Äì1298 and in 1309 Escheator citra Trentam (\\"on this side of the River Trent\\").Glos. Notes & Queries, vol.3, 1887, p.295 Little is known of the origin or history of this family, but Sir Robert Atkyns (died 1711) in his \\"History of Gloucestershire\\" stated him to be a younger son of Fulk FitzWarin, yet failed to explain his deduction. He may in fact have been the son-in-law of Fulk as his widow is recorded with the name of \\"Margaret Waryn\\" and was still alive in 1322, as the Inquisition post mortem of Walter's son Walter (died 1322) (sometime Escheator of GloucestershireCorbet, Augusta E., p.178)states her to have been then holding in dower 1/3rd of the manor of Alveston. The grant to Walter (died 1310) in 1309 was in fact made, contrary to the licence, \\"in fee\\" (i.e. hereditable) and Walter's grandson, another Walter de Gloucester (died 1360) was still in possession of the manor of Alveston in 1340/1.Chancery Inq. Ad Quod Damnum, C 143/252/5 The trespass of obtaining a grant in fee without licence to alienate a tenancy-in-chief was pardoned on 28 July 1340 to Walter of Gloucester on payment of a fine.Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, p.498, note (b), quoting Patent Rolls, 14 Edward III, p.3, m.48 Corbet Arms of Corbet of Hope (Salop.), Siston & Alveston: Argent, a raven proper within a bordure sable bezantee The de Gloucester manors of Alveston and \\"Urcott\\" (Earthcott Green) together with Langley Hundred were settled during the reign of King Edward III (1327‚Äì1377) onto the heir of Peter Corbet (died 1363) of Hope, Salop., and later of Siston. Walter FitzWalter de Gloucester (died 1360) had married Petronilla (or Pernel), one of the three daughters of William Corbet (born c. 1280) of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcs., and Siston, Gloucestershire. In 1342 following this marriage Walter settled the manors of Alveston and Erdecote and the hundred of \\"Langele\\" on himself and his wife for their joint lives and the life of the survivor of them, with remainder to their joint issue, and in default of such issue with remainder to Peter Corbet of Syston and his heirs.Glos. Notes & Queries, p.295, quoting Fine Roll 16 Edward III (1342) Peter Corbet (died 1362) was the next younger brother and heir of William Corbet (who presumably was dead by then and unlike his brother had no male offspring) and was therefore Petronilla's uncle.Corbet, Augusta E., p.178. Glos. Notes & Queries, p.295 incorrectly gives her as Peter Corbet's daughter Walter and Petronilla's son Peter de Gloucester married a certain Alice. Peter de Gloucester died childless before 1370, as is apparent from the fact that the settlement made by his father had taken effect by then in granting the de Gloucester lands, including Alveston, to John Corbet (died 1370), the grandson and heir of Sir Peter Corbet (died 1362). John Corbet had outlived his father William who had a short life, but himself died aged only 17, leaving his triplet William Corbet (1353‚Äì1378) his heir, who in turn also died young in 1378 aged only 25. Alice de Gloucester, widow of Peter de Gloucester, was then still alive and was recorded in the Inquisition post mortem of William Corbet dated 1378 as holding 1/3rd dower share of Alveston.Inq. p.m. William Corbet, 1378 The young William Corbet had become a merchant dealing in the wool-trade as on his death he owed the very great sum of ¬£320 for merchandise received to the Bristol merchant and clothier John Canynges (died 1405),National Archives: Chancery: Certificates of Statute Merchant and Statute Staple C 241/162/33 father of the great Bristol merchant William II Canynges (died 1474). This sum had been incurred before 1375, as a record from that year of Extent for Debts heard before Walter Frampton, Mayor of the Staple of Bristol reveals,National Archives, Chancery, Extent for Debts, Series I C 131/26/1 and represented several multiples of the annual value of the revenue from all the Corbet family's Gloucestershire manors, and clearly placed the inheritance in a precarious position. Indeed, John Canynges and his business partner William Cheddar the Elder had taken temporary possession of William Corbet's 2/3rds occupancy of Alveston manor as security for their debt, and later granted it by gift to William II Canynges (died 1474) who held it from them as a \\"free tenant\\".Bush, Thomas, 1901, Bath Natural History & Antiquarian Field Club, vol 9, pp.58‚Äì70 Young William's own heir was his sister Margaret Corbet (died 1398), who brought the Corbet manors to her husband William Wyriott (died 1379) from Pembrokeshire. Wyriott died before the couple had produced any offspring and Margaret married secondly Sir Gilbert Denys (died 1422) from Waterton in the lordship of Coity, Glamorgan. Thus the manors of Alveston, Earthcott Green and Siston together with Langley Hundred entered into the possession of the Denys family. Denys Arms of Denys: \\"Gules, 3 leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailled azure\\" The widow Alice de Gloucester remarried to Alan Eckylsale and the couple remitted all their rights in her 1/3 dower in Alveston in consideration of 100 marks paid by Gilbert Denys and Margaret.Feet of Fines 1395, quoted by Bush, Thomas, Proceedings of Bath Natural History Society etc. vol. 9, pp.58‚Äì70 who thus had obtained vacant possession of the manor. Modern Alveston In the 19th century, the village of Alveston was centred on Church Farm, on the lane leading from Rudgeway to Iron Acton. Some people consider the modern Alveston to be centred on the Ship Inn. The Ship Inn at Alveston is an old Coaching House which dates back to 1589. In the 19th century, the area around the Ship Inn was known as Alveston Green. Most consider Alveston Parade ‚Äì a small shopping area ‚Äì to be the centre. The main road to Gloucester originally passed the Ship Inn, before turning east to join the current line of the A38 trunk road. A short bypass was added during the 20th century. Alveston Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903/4. The club was wound up in 1948.‚ÄúAlveston Golf Club‚Äù , ‚ÄúGolf's Missing Links‚Äù. Marlwood School Marlwood School is a mixed comprehensive which serves Alveston and the surrounding area. The school was founded in 1606 as Thornbury's grammar school , but relocated to its present site in 1972 when it became comprehensive. It is so named because of its location adjacent to the Marlwood Estate. The school marked its 400th anniversary in 2006 and several events took place in celebration.

Alveston Old Church of St Helen is visible next to the house The ruins of Alveston Old Church of St Helens is situated in Rudgeway, south of the modern village of Alveston, along the A38. The separate parish of Alveston was not formed until 1846, before which time Alveston manor was within the parish of Olveston. Following the development and growth of the modern village of Alveston some distance away from the manor house and the Church of St. Helen next door to it, it was determined by the village authorities to build a new church, again dedicated to St Helen, nearer to the new village. The old church fell into disuse and decay, and today only the tower and south aisle wall remain standing, although the structure has been restored to a high standard by the aerospace company Rolls-Royce plc, the owner of both the former manor house, now used for corporate hospitality and known as \\"Old Church Farm\\", and the church itself.

It is located some 25 kilometers north east of Geneva's city centre, and since the 1970s it has become part of the Geneva metropolitan area. It lies on the shores of Lake Geneva and is the seat of Nyon District. The town has () a population of and is famous in the sporting world for being the headquarters of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the European Club Association (ECA). It is connected to the rest of Switzerland by way of the Route Suisse, the A1 Motorway and the railways of the Arc L√©manique. Name Nyon derives from one of the names used by the Romans for the town, Noviodunum or Noiodunum. Other names for the town, particularly of colonies placed there, are Colonia Iulia Equestris or Colonia Julia Equestris, Colonia Equestris Noiodunum, Equestris, Civitas Equestrium, and Civitas Equestrium Noiodunum. History Nyon is first mentioned around 367‚Äì407 as civitas Equestrium id est Noiodunus (in the \\"Notitia Galliarum\\"). In 1236, it was mentioned as Neveduni and in 1292 as Nyons. Pre-Roman settlements A few scattered neolithic items were discovered in the 19th century. North of the city, some bronze rings and the ruins of a Bronze Age settlement were discovered. Noviodunum It was founded by the Romans between 50 and 44 BC under the name of Colonia Iulia Equestris or Colonia Equestris Noiodunum, the urban center of which was called Noviodunum. It grew to be one of the most important Roman colonies in modern- day Switzerland, with a forum, a basilica and an amphitheater that was discovered only recently, in 1996, when digging for the construction of a new building. At Roman contact, the country round the town was held by the Helvetii. The town's importance is reflected in its numerous mentions in ancient sources. The Antonine Itineraries place the town on the road from Geneva to Lacus Lausonius (near Lausanne). It is first mentioned by Pliny (H.N., iv. 7), and then by Ptolemy (ii. 9), who assigns it to the Sequani. Pliny and Ptolemy simply name it Equestris; and so it is named in the Itineraries. On some inscriptions it is called Civ. Equestrium (short for Civitas Equestrium), and Col. Julia Equ. (short for Colonia Julia Equestris) from which some have concluded that it was founded by Julius Caesar. In the Notitia it is called Civ. Equestrium Noiodunum (short for Civitas Equestrium Noiodunum). The district in which Nyon stands is called Pagus Equestricus in a document of the year 1011; and it is said that the people of the country as of the 18th century still called this district Enquestre. (D'Anville, Notice, &c.; Walckenaer, G√©ographie, &c.;, des Gaules, vol. ii. p. 316.) Noviodunum was part of a loose network of settlements that radiated out from Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France) and helped to control the Rhone Valley. It served, along with other Roman colonies in the area, to control the Helvetii who were settled in the area against their will after their defeat at the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BC. A rectangular grid pattern divided the area of the wall- less city. A monumental center, housing everything needed for the economic, religious and social life of the colony, was established. Only portions of this first forum have been discovered. At its east end was a two-story basilica. Grid-like residential streets radiated out from the center. Under Tiberius, the forum was expanded and redesigned into a familiar pattern for the provinces. The sacred area was surrounded on three sides by colonnades, which were built on half-sunken Cryptoporticus. Two outbuildings, including most likely the seat of the Curia, flanked the building. A market building (macellum) with a central courtyard around which were the sales rooms, and the baths (tepidarium with geometric shapes and mosaics) were renovated. The forum witnessed further transformations, particularly the establishment of another large building. During the same building phase a large mosaic on the central part of the north portico was built. The amphitheater, which was discovered in 1996, was probably built in the early 2nd century AD. Its arena, which was flanked by two prisons and provided with sewers, is about . The ruins of the theater, that should have been in the Colonia, have not been discovered. The residential quarters consisted of modest homes, in addition to some domi with gardens and pools. The buildings were originally made of wood and clay, but after the mid-1st century AD were built from masonry. Some villa suburbana stood in the west of the village, while the artisan and merchant quarter, presumably, developed in the southwest. A long aqueduct which ran from the Divonne area to the colony, provided the water supply. Sewage canals, that followed the road networks, dumped sewage into the lake. Decline of the Roman colonia After a long period of peace and prosperity, signs of crisis and general insecurity were increasing in the early 3rd century. As a result of Alamanni invasions of 259 or 260 AD, the forum and the public buildings in the city were razed. The stone blocks were scattered all over the Lake Geneva region. The stones were re-used as building material, especially in Geneva, where about 300 were used in the construction of the wall. But the settlement was not abandoned. Nyon-Noviodunum, which had already lost much of its prestige and reputation was as a regional capital, now separated from Geneva. Geneva became the center and seat of the diocese which initially fought to administer the territory that had been part of the Colonia. Medieval Nyon Nyon Castle Narrow streets in Nyon During the Carolingian era, Nyon belonged to the county of Geneva. In a 926 charter, Rudolph II of Burgundy mentioned that this area was under a comes de pago Equestrico. During the Second Kingdom of Burgundy, Nyon became independent from Geneva. In 1032, Rudolf III granted Nyon to the Archbishop of Besan√ßon. The bishop granted Nyon to the Lord of Prangins as a fief. After 1130, Humbert de Cossonay, the Lord of Prangins, held his court in Nyon. A market was built in 1211. In 1272, the Archbishop of Besan√ßon confirmed Philip of Savoy's right to administer high justice in Nyon. In 1279, Aymon of Prangins unsuccessfully rebelled against the counts of Savoy, but was forced to acknowledge Savoy authority over him and Nyon. The Castle is first mentioned in 1272, but probably dates back to the Lords of Prangins. It was rebuilt by Louis I of Savoy in 1463. The rectangular edifice was built in a variety of styles. Around the same time, the square C√©sar Tower or Tour de Rive (now a residence), was built to defend the city. In 1293, Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, and his brother Louis I, Baron of Vaud, conquered the city by besieging it from both the land and the lake. They confirmed the town rights which had been granted to Nyon by Aymon of Prangins, and extended further rights and freedoms. It became one of the four bonnes villes of Canton Vaud. In 1294, Louis I began to expand Nyon as a center of his power after Amadeus granted his share of the conquest to Louis. He created a court and a mint, which minted coins for the lords of Vaud between 1286 and 1350. In 1323 Louis II, granted the so-called mountains of Nyon, i.e. pastures and forests in the area of Arzier and Saint-Cergue, to Nyon. In 1359 Nyon lost importance after Amadeus VI acquired rights over the entire Vaud. In 1364 the town charter of Morges replaced the charter in Nyon. This change was reconfirmed in 1439. Under the new charter, the town gained greater self-sufficiency. The mint in Nyon reopened in 1430. In 1530 the Swiss Confederation invaded Vaud and acquired Nyon. Then in 1536, Nyon surrendered again to Bern without a fight as Bernese troops marched through to support Geneva. Starting in 1323, the municipal government was composed of eight procurators and a mayor. A little later the government was replaced by a community meeting which was headed by two mayors (Syndics). The Town Hall is first mentioned in 1508. Interior of the Church of Notre-Dame A Benedictine priory was founded in the first half of the 12th century in Nyon. In 1244 it was given to the Augustinian order. The last prior, before the Reformation in 1535 was Aymon de Gingins, who was also the abbot of Bonmont and the selected Bishop of Geneva. In 1295‚Äì96, Louis I, Duke of Savoy, built a Franciscan monastery under the patronage of St. Francis, in which several members of the House of Savoy were buried. In 1530, Bern and Fribourg plundered the monastery for the first time, and Bern destroyed all the pictures of saints. In 1536, it was burned by the withdrawing Savoy garrison. In 1110 Geneva granted authority over the church of Notre-Dame to the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Oyend (Saint- Claude). The church was built with material from the Roman period and replaced an earlier Christian church. The choir dates from the 12th century, and the nave was built in 1448. The vault and the side chapels were built in 1470‚Äì81. Situated outside the city walls was the church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste, also known as Corps-Saints. The church is first mentioned in 1346. By 1412, it was administered by the Augustinian Priory. Until the Reformation it was a pilgrimage site where the relics of the martyrs of the Theban Legion were revered. Bern ordered the church destroyed in 1537. Early Modern Nyon Nyon in 1642 Nyon was raised to the status of administrative center of a Vogtei of Bern in 1536. It remained the seat of the vogt until the Vaud revolution of 1798. In 1568, a yearly market took place for the first time. In 1574‚Äì80 the castle was converted into the seat of the bailiff. It was renovated several times in the following centuries. The municipal government added a Council of Fifty in 1558 and in 1578, an inner council of Twenty-four. The inner council was made up of nobles, citizens and habitants. Later the councils became a Council of Twelve and a council of Twenty-Four, which was headed by a knight banneret. In 1570, Theodore Beza headed the regional assembly of Protestant refugee clergymen in Nyon. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many Huguenots fled to Nyon. In 1688, they founded the Bourse fran√ßaise to help other refugees. Nyon remained an important transhipment point for trade along Lake Geneva and from France and Italy. Grain and wood came from Burgundy and Franche-Comt√© through the Col de la Givrine and Saint-Cergue on to Geneva. In 1537‚Äì76, the customs post of Nyon was the most profitable in the bailiwick. Over the following centuries, trade through Nyon remained very profitable and by 1772‚Äì73, it was again the highest in the region. In the 18th century, trade and commerce grew strongly. The flow of goods allowed four (after 1738, five) yearly markets. A granary was built in the 18th century. The Bernese rebuilt the Asse canal system to drive tanneries, sawmills and mills. The Fa√Øencerie Baylon earthenware factory was founded in 1769. It was followed by the Jacob Dortu and Ferdinand M√ºller porcelain factory in 1781, both of which contributed Nyon's reputation for fine ceramics. With the profits of the Early Modern era, many of the public buildings of Nyon were rebuilt or expanded. Following the suppression of the monasteries, in 1539, the town hospital moved into the offices of the Augustinian convent and received money from the closed monasteries. Hans- Ulrich Heldt rebuilt the College, the original building was from 1559, in 1786 in a neoclassical style. The church of Notre-Dame was rebuilt several times between 1661 and 1718. The medieval city walls and gates were demolished in 1718. The town hall was rebuilt in 1773. In 1720, Louis de Saint-Georges, a minister of the English king, built Changins Castle. The city was one of the most active centers of the revolutionary movement in the Vaud region. The councils of Nyon formed an oversight committee and refused to pay homage to Bern on 10 January 1798. A few days later, they secured the support of the French General in support of the independence of Canton Vaud. When this proclamation of support was brought from Nyon to Lausanne, on 24 January 1798, it finally led to the Vaudois revolution. From 1798 to 1803, it was in the canton of L√©man of the Helvetic Republic as district capital. Modern Nyon In the first half of the 19th century, the city continued with the demolition of the fortifications, but left wall remains at the Promenade des Marronniers and by the tower of Notre Dame. During the 19th century the Reformed parish church was rebuilt several times. The Catholic Church was consecrated in 1839, and a chapel for the √âglise libre (Free Church) was finished in 1872. In 1858, a station of the railway line Lausanne‚ÄìGeneva was built in north of Nyon. New housing developments sprung up around this station, and the city began to spread. The railroads Nyon‚ÄìCrassier‚ÄìDivonne (1905) and Nyon‚ÄìSaint-Cergue‚ÄìMorez (1916) connected Nyon with its hinterland. To meet the needs of the economy, the shipping industry and the emerging tourism industry, a port was built in 1838 and a quay was added in 1873. By the middle of the 19th century, a major source of income was the sale of timber from the commons forest. Other industries included tanneries (closed in 1925), carpentry, saw mills (until 1935), mills (including Andre & Cie.), cooperages and a soap factory. The Fa√Øencerie Baylon closed in 1828. The porcelain factory, M√ºller et Dortu temporarily closed in 1813, then resumed production of ceramics in the Art Nouveau style in 1878. From then on until 1980 they produced Stoneware. Other industries in Nyon include the pasta factory Sangal SA (1860‚Äì1996), Zyma (1906, since 1996, Swiss Novartis Consumer Health), Stellram (hard metal treatment, 1940‚Äì99), Cherix et Filanosa SA (printing and graphic arts, 1932) and several tool factories. Starting in 1966, the companies stopped using the local locks and dams for hydropower and by 1974 they had disappeared from the Asse river. In 1937, it hosted the Nyon Conference. Current situation Nyon has a high school (Gymnase de Nyon, known as CESSOuest until 1997 or 1998), a modern hospital, a movie theater, numerous hotels, restaurants, and cafes. The town is well known on the international stage as the home of the headquarters for UEFA, the governing body for football in Europe. It is also the seat of the international headquarters of the global union federation UNI Global Union. Nyon is also a major centre for the International Money-Broking Industry. In the last week of July each year, Nyon hosts the Pal√©o Festival, the second largest outdoor festival in Europe (although technically the festival is in the village of L'Asse). Nyon Rugby Club is one of the top rugby teams in Switzerland and is twinned with Ealing Rugby Club in West London. Nyon also hosts Visions du R√©el international film festival every April. Nyon has been the regular host of the draws of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League as well as other UEFA Football competitions.UEFA Cup draws Geography View of Nyon from Nyon Castle Aerial view (1949) Nyon has an area, , of .

It was at first supported by Goldwin Smith and Edward Blake. Ontario residents, George Denison, Charles Mair, William Alexander Foster and Robert Grant Haliburton founded the movement. John Christian Schultz, Canadian Party founder, became a leading member of the Canadian Party and was a chief opponent of Louis Riel. The execution of Thomas Scott during the 1870 Red River Rebellion was a major catalyst in the formation of the Canada First movement. Caught in the middle of the rebellion, Schultz and Mair narrowly escaped execution themselves. Upon their return to Ontario the two men were featured prominently in a massive Toronto protest organized by the Canada Firsters. Tapping into Orange Protestant outrage over the killing of Scott the movement's leaders stressed the theme of national betrayal at the hands of the Red River rebels and Louis Riel. On the occasion of an 1874 by-election in the Federal district of West Toronto the Canada First movement became an official political party known as the Canadian National Association. Although the party failed to nominate a candidate, they released a party-platform that called for the \\"British Connection, Consolidation of the Empire and in the meantime a voice in treaties affecting Canada.\\" Wanting a greater voice and autonomy for Canada in conducting its own foreign policy the movement heralded the Imperial Federation movement. Although the party counted among its early supporters former Ontario Premier and prominent Liberal Edward Blake, Blake's decision to accept a position in Alexander Mackenzie's government in 1875 led to the party's quick collapse. By 1876 their weekly newspaper organ The Nation, edited by Charles Lindsey, had closed. References Further reading * Farrell, D.

At the end of 2017, it had 12.4 million members. USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group. USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their families. The company ranked No. 100 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.  History  The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England, early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty-five United States Army Officers on June 20, 1922, at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance. USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying (a former horse farm). USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. It launched a toll-free number in 1978, and Internet sales and service in 1999 via its website. The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s. USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA's investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions. In 2015, USAA employed more than 32,000 people at its offices throughout the world. On July 26, 2019, the Charles Schwab Corporation announced it would acquire USAA's investment and brokerage accounts for $1.8 billion. The deal with Charles Schwab closed on May 26, 2020.  Lines of business   Property, casualty, and life insurance  USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C;) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C; insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war- exclusion clause.  Banking  Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts. USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online. Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad, mobile devices with Google's Android operating system, and Microsoft's Windows Phone. As of August 2019, the USAA Mobile App is used for messaging rather than text messaging. Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, and Navy Federal Credit Union.  Investing and financial planning  USAA provides Education 529 Plans for its members, but members are referred to its strategic partners, Charles Schwab Corporation and Victory Capital Management for other investment services such as brokerage and trading, mutual funds & ETFs.  Target market  USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.\\" Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C; insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit). Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996. In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.  Leadership  USAA president and CEO Stuart Parker retired on February 1, 2020, and USAA chose a replacement from within: Wayne Peacock, the company's president of property and casualty insurance. Wayne Peacock is currently the CEO of USAA. Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Admiral Thomas B. Fargo, USN (Ret.), USAA's board of directors named Wayne Peacock CEO-elect in January 2020 to succeed former CEO Stuart Parker after his retirement in February 2020. Peacock became CEO in February 2020 and is the first USAA CEO who is not veteran of the armed forces. He has been with USAA since 1988, serving in various leadership positions including President of the Property and Casualty Insurance Group. USAA former CEOs include retired Air Force brigadier general Robert F. McDermott. The USAA office building in San Antonio was constructed under his tenure, and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone. He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert T. Herres. It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services. Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly. His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010; however, he retired in December 2007. The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, \\"I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'.\\" On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1‚Äì5.  Locations  Colorado Springs location Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix. USAA also has offices in Chesapeake, Virginia; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Highland Falls, New York; Plano, Texas; and Tampa, Florida. Internationally, USAA has offices in London and Frankfurt.

Banff and Buchan is a committee area of the Aberdeenshire Council, Scotland. It has a population of 35,742 (2001 Census). Fishing and agriculture are important industries, together with associated processing and service activity. Banff and Buchan was also the name of a district of Grampian Region between 1975 and 1996. The district covered a much larger area than the committee area, and included what are now the committee areas of Buchan, which, despite its name, is not part of the committee area of Banff and Buchan, and Formartine.  Banff and Buchan committee area  The area is relatively self-contained, and in recent years has seen a small decline in population. It does, however, have tourism assets in its coastline, coastal villages and visitor attractions. Economic dependency, peripherality, and the future of the Common Fisheries/Agricultural Policies, are key issues. The Buchan Local Action Plan will address some of these concerns. The Area qualifies for European Union Objective 2 structural funding.

Banff and Buchan was formerly a local government district in the Grampian region, created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1973 It combined, from the former county of Banff, a Banff area (including the burgh of Banff), the burghs of Aberchirder, Macduff and Portsoy, and Aberchirder and Fordyce areas, and, from the former county of Aberdeen, the burghs of Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Rosehearty and Turriff, and Cruden and Deer Turriff areas. (The rest of the county of Banff became part of the Moray district of the region.) In 1996, the Banff and Buchan district was merged into the Aberdeenshire unitary council area, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994.

Overview A U.S. Marine fires a Mk 19 40 mm grenade launcher in Quantico, Virginia in September 2000. The Mk 19 is a belt-fed, blowback-operated, air- cooled, crew-served, fully automatic weapon that is designed not to cook off. It fires 40 mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 325 to 375 rounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rounds per minute (rapid) and 40 rounds per minute (sustained). The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the weapon. The Mk 19 can launch its grenade at a maximum distance of , though its effective range to a point target is about , since the large rear leaf sight is only graduated as far. The nearest safe distance to launch the grenade is 310 meters in training and 75 meters in combat. Though the Mk 19 has a flash suppressor, it serves only to save the eyesight of its operator, not concealing the weapon's position. For night operation, a picatinny rail quadrant sight can be added for thermal and night vision optics. The Mk 19A is a man-portable crew-served weapon that can fire from a tripod-mounted position or from a vehicle mount, with the latter being the preferred method, as the weapon alone weighs . The primary ammunition for it is the high-explosive dual-purpose M430 grenade. On impact, the grenade can kill anyone within a radius of five meters, and wound them within a radius of 15 meters. It can also punch through of rolled homogeneous armor with a direct hit (0-degree obliquity), which means it can penetrate most infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers. It is especially effective when used against enemy infantry formations. The ammunition comes in cans that hold a 32- or 48-grenade belt weighing , respectively. Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats, fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV), AAV and Stryker, military jeeps, and a large variety of naval mounts. The Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher replaced the earlier Mk 18 hand- cranked multiple grenade launcher. The 40 mm ammunition used (40√ó53 mm) is not interchangeable with that used in the M203 (40√ó46 mm). The M203 ammunition develops a lower chamber pressure, and resultant lower muzzle velocity and range, compared to ammunition loaded for the Mk 19\\\\. The Mk 19 fires from an open bolt. The rounds are mechanically fed onto the bolt face with the pull of the charging handles. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt closes, and the firing pin is released. The recoil blows back the bolt, feeds a new round onto the bolt face, which pushes the expended casing off the bolt face. Production of the Mk 19 is managed by Saco Defense Industries (now a division of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems). In November 2014, General Dynamics entered into an agreement with Advanced Material Engineering Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Kinetics, to manufacture 40 mm high- velocity airburst ammunition for the U.S. military. The 40 mm airburst grenade uses a programmable, time-based fuse that computes and programs the detonation time into it, which counts down once fired to zero to detonate at the intended target point. The airburst ammunition is compatible with the Mk 19, which would give it greater effectiveness and lethality, particularly against concealed and defilade targets.General Dynamics to manufacture ST Kinetics' 40mm High Velocity Air Burst Ammunition - Armyrecognition.com, 20 November 2014 The U.S. Army plans to introduce several new features to the Mk 19 in an upgrade package that could be introduced by late 2017. Initiatives include: increased muzzle velocity through a less resistant barrel; increased cyclic rate from an improved profile for the vertical cam to reduce the force needed to charge the weapon; enhancing reliability with a redesigned round- positioning block to decrease the chance of misfires; increased durability and shortened re-assembly time after maintenance from a new cocking cam and lever; and an updated mechanical sight utilizing up-to-date ammunition ballistic data to aid accuracy.Army building a better grenade machine gun, Army Times, 2 July 2016 Users GDOTS has built nearly 35,000 Mk 19 Mod 3 systems for roughly 30 customers since 1984.

Formed in 1962, it seeks to revoke the status of Man as a British self- governing Crown dependency and establish a completely sovereign state, which would be a republic. It describes its aims as being: It is alternatively called or subtitled \\"The Manx Nationalist Party\\" (see both the party's homepage and the party's news sheet \\"Yn Pabyr Seyr\\") but is not to be confused with the Manx National Party, which was a name used by another party. History Mec Vannin was formed in 1962 and has held minuted meetings since February 1964. 's growth can be considered to be directly parallel to the Isle of Man's status as a tax haven.Yahoo! Groups In particular, they have campaigned strongly against immigration to the island, particularly from England. This continues to feature strongly in their current platformImmigration, who's kidding who? and policy: :\\"In a small island nation such as ours, in default of policies to control the growth of the finance sector, policies to control the size of the population are essential for the achievement of economic, ecological and cultural sustainability. The rapid and unnatural population increase, due to an open door policy on immigration, has increased the burden on the island's infrastructure and environment whilst eroding the fabric of community life. As a result, Mec Vannin believes the immediate introduction of immigration controls to be a priority.\\"Mec Vannin Policy In the 1976 election Mec Vannin put up ten candidates. Only one was successful though, Peter Craine. He remains the only person to have been a Member of the House of Keys (MHK), although several ex-members have gone on to become MHKs, such as Treasury Minister Allan Bell, Phil Gawne and Hazel Hannan. Peter Craine subsequently left the party, joining the short-lived breakaway Manx National Party which was formed in 1977 and disbanded in 1981. Additional policy Mec Vannin's environmentalist policies include opposition to overuse of fossil fuels. They support further decentralisation of power within the island, to local councils. Other policies include: * Reforestation - by native deciduous species * Fishing as \\"a viable part of the economy\\", with stronger fisheries protection. * Farming self-sufficiency for the Isle of Man. * Revitalisation of Manx tourism * A Manx university * A socialised health service * Separate Manx nationality: :\\"Manx nationality must be defined by legislation and a Manx passport introduced, with Manx nationality being first citizenship. Whilst all residents would be eligible for Manx citizenship upon the introduction of legislation, subsequent new residents could only become citizens after due process of naturalisation. Only Manx citizens would be eligible to vote or to stand for representative public office.\\" * On customs union: :\\"The right to determine indirect taxation, including VAT. This necessitates the cessation of the Customs and Excise Agreement.\\" Mec Vannin is also highly critical of the Manx legal and policing systems, as they currently stand.

Rear Admiral Souers was appointed as the first Director of Central Intelligence on January 23, 1946 by President Harry S. Truman, where he would be in charge of the new Central Intelligence Group (CIG). Prior to this, as Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence, Souers had been one of the architects of the system that came into being with the President's directive. He had written the intelligence chapter of the Eberstadt Report, which advocated a unified intelligence system. Toward the end of 1945, when the competing plans for a national intelligence system were deadlocked, Souers' views had come to the attention of the President, and he seems to have played a role in breaking the impasse. Souers subsequently became executive secretary of the United States National Security Council. In this role he saw President Truman daily, and was the person Truman talked to most regarding national security issues. It was through Souers that Truman first learned of the possible existence of the hydrogen bomb, and Souers coordinated some of the work being done by different departments during the U.S. government's debate regarding whether to go forward with the development of that weapon.

Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa and Southeast Europe, most notably the Silk Road. Although many were located along rural roads in the countryside, urban versions of caravanserais were also historically common in cities throughout the Islamic world, though they were often called by other names such as khan, wikala, or funduq. Izadkhast caravanserai (early 17th century), Fars Province, Iranalt=275x275px Terms and etymology Ganjali Khan Caravanserai (1598), in Kerman, Iran Caravanserai The word kƒÅrvƒÅnsarƒÅy is a Persian compound word combining kƒÅrvƒÅn \\"caravan\\" with sarƒÅy \\"palace\\", \\"building with enclosed courts\\". Here \\"caravan\\" means a group of traders, pilgrims or other travellers, engaged in long-distance travel. The word is also rendered as caravansary, caravansaray, caravanseray, caravansara, and caravansarai. In scholarly sources, it is often used as an umbrella term for multiple related types of commercial buildings similar to inns or hostels, whereas the actual instances of such buildings had a variety of names depending on the region and the local language. However, the term was typically preferred for rural inns built along roads outside of city walls. The word serai is sometimes used with the implication of caravanserai. A number of place-names based on the word sarai have grown up: Mughal Serai, Sarai Alamgir and the Delhi Sarai Rohilla railway station for example, and a great many other places are also based on the original meaning of \\"palace\\". Khan As'ad Pasha (1751-52) in Damascus, Syriaalt= Khan The word khan () derives from Middle Persian h æn' (xƒÅn, ‚Äúhouse‚Äù).MacKenzie, D. N. (1971), ‚ÄúxƒÅn‚Äù, in A concise Pahlavi dictionary, London, New York, Toronto: Oxford University Press, p. 93. It typically referred to an \\"urban caravanserai\\" built within a town or a city. In Turkish the word is rendered as han. The same word was used in Bosnian, having arrived through Ottoman conquest. In addition to Turkish and Persian, the term was widely used in Arabic as well, and examples of such buildings are found throughout the Middle East from as early as the Ummayyad period.  Funduq  Funduq al-Najjarin in Fes, Morocco The term funduq (; sometimes spelled foundouk or fondouk from the French transliteration) is frequently used for historic inns in Morocco and around western North Africa. The word comes from Greek pandocheion, lit.: \\"welcoming all\\", thus meaning 'inn', led to funduq in Arabic (), pundak in Hebrew (◊§◊ï◊†◊ì◊ß), fundaco in Venice, fondaco in Genoa and alh√≥ndiga or fonda in Spanish (funduq is the origin of Spanish term fonda). In the cities of this region such buildings were also frequently used as housing for artisan workshops.  Wikala  The Arabic word wikala (ŸàŸÉÿßŸÑÿ©), sometimes spelled wakala or wekala, is a term found frequently in historic Cairo for an urban caravanserai which housed merchants and their goods and served as a center for trade, storage, transactions and other commercial activity. The word wikala means roughly \\"agency\\" in Arabic, in this case a commercial agency, which may also have been a reference to the customs offices that could be located here to deal with imported goods. The term khan was also frequently used for this type of building in Egypt.  History  The entrance portal of the left Corral del Carb√≥n, a former caravanserai in Granada, Spain Caravanserais were a common feature not only along the Silk Road, but also along the Achaemenid Empire's Royal Road, a ancient highway that stretched from Sardis to Susa according to Herodotus: \\"Now the true account of the road in question is the following: Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais; and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from danger.\\"\\"The History - Herodotus\\" - http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt Other significant urban caravanserais were built along the Grand Trunk Road in the Indian subcontinent, especially in the region of Mughal Delhi and Bengal Subah. Throughout most of the Islamic period (7th century and after), caravanserais were a common type of structure both in the rural countryside and in dense urban centers across the Middle East, North Africa, and Ottoman Europe. A number of 12th to 13th-century caravanserais or hans were built throughout the Seljuk Empire, many examples of which have survived across Turkey today (e.g. the large Sultan Han in Aksaray Province) as well as in Iran (e.g. the Ribat-i Sharaf in Khorasan). Urban versions of caravanserais also became important centers of economic activity in cities across these different regions of the Muslim world, often concentrated near the main souq areas, with many examples still standing in the historic areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Cairo, Istanbul, Fes, etc. In many parts of the Muslim world, caravanserais also provided revenues that were used to fund charitable or religious functions or buildings. These revenues and functions were managed through a waqf, a protected agreement which gave certain buildings and revenues the status of mortmain endowments guaranteed under Islamic law.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press. Many major religious complexes in the Ottoman and Mamluk empires, for example, either included a caravanserai building (like in the k√ºlliye of the S√ºleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul) or drew revenues from one in the area (such as the Wikala al-Ghuri in Cairo, which was built to contribute revenues for the nearby complex of Sultan al-Ghuri).  Caravanserai in Arab literature  Al-Muqaddasi the Arab geographer wrote in 985 CE about the hostelries, or wayfarers' inns, in the Province of Palestine, a province at that time listed under the topography of Syria, saying: \\"Taxes are not heavy in Syria, with the exception of those levied on the Caravanserais (Fanduk); Here, however, the duties are oppressive...\\"Mukaddasi, Description of Syria, Including Palestine, ed. Guy Le Strange, London 1886, pp. 91, 37 The reference here being to the imposts and duties charged by government officials on the importation of goods and merchandise, the importers of which and their beasts of burden usually stopping to take rest in these places. Guards were stationed at every gate to ensure that taxes for these goods be paid in full, while the revenues therefrom accruing to the Fatimid kingdom of Egypt. Architecture A sample left The courtyard of the alt= Most typically a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular walled exterior, with a single portal wide enough to permit large or heavily laden beasts such as camels to enter. The courtyard was almost always open to the sky, and the inside walls of the enclosure were outfitted with a number of identical animal stalls, bays, niches or chambers to accommodate merchants and their servants, animals, and merchandise.Sims, Eleanor. 1978. Trade and Travel: Markets and Caravansary.' In: Michell, George. (ed.). 1978. Architecture of the Islamic World - Its History and Social Meaning. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 101. Caravanserais provided water for human and animal consumption, washing and ritual purification such as wudu and ghusl. Sometimes they had elaborate public baths (hammams), or other attached amenities such as a fountain or a sabil/sebil. They also kept fodder for animals and had shops for travellers where they could acquire new supplies. In addition, some shops bought goods from the travelling merchants.Ciolek, T. Matthew. 2004-present. Catalogue of Georeferenced Caravansaras/Khans . Old World Trade Routes (OWTRAD) Project. Canberra: www.ciolek.com - Asia Pacific Research Online. Many caravanserais were also equipped with small mosques, such as the elevated examples in the Seljuk and Ottoman caravanserais in Turkey. Wikala of Sultan al-Ghuri (1504-05), one of the best-preserved examples in Cairo In Cairo, starting in the Burji Mamluk period, wikalas (urban caravanserais) were frequently several stories tall and often included a rab', a low-income rental apartment complex, which was situated on the upper floors while the merchant accommodations occupied the lower floors. In addition to making the best use of limited space in a crowded city, this also provided the building with two sources of revenue which were managed through the waqf system.

Completed in 2004, the development was built by Manhattan Loft Corporation and the now-defunct MWB Group Holdings. The distinctive glass- and aluminium-clad tower was designed by HOK. The building is 111 metres (364 feet) tall and has 33 floors (not including roof). The bottom 12 floors house a Marriott Hotel, including 47 serviced suites on floors 9-12. Floors 13-33 house 158 apartments. The tower overlooks West India Docks and the Canary Wharf estate. History In 2001, planning permission was gained by Squire and Partners for a slender landmark mixed-use tower conceived to act as a visual counterpoint to the monumental brick form of the adjacent Victorian warehouses in London's Docklands. Designed by HOK, its elliptical form is reminiscent of the curved hull of a boat. The plans were part of the redevelopment of the area. While works had been expected to finish in May 2004, the skyscraper was not handed over until December. A report in The Times said that MWB Group Holdings and its partner Manhattan Loft Corporation had \\"fallen out\\" with contractor Multiplex over the delays. Multiplex had been \\"demanding more than ¬£100m in extra payment from MWB, claiming delays were caused by the changes MWB sought\\", with MWB refusing to pay. The dispute was escalated to an independent arbitrator for adjudication. On-screen appearances In the film Run Fatboy Run, the character Whit owns an apartment in 1 West India Quay.

Anticipating the defeat of Germany and Japan, they had already set up the European Advisory Commission and a proposed Far Eastern Advisory Commission to make recommendations for the post war period. Accordingly, they managed their control of the defeated countries through Allied Commissions, often referred to as Allied Control Commissions (ACC), consisting of representatives of the major Allies. Italy Under the provisions of Article 37 in the Armistice with Italy Instrument of Surrender, September 29, 1943, the Control Commission for Italy was established on November 10, 1943, and was dismantled following the conclusion of the Italian Peace Treaty at the Paris Peace Conference in 1947. Romania King Michael I of Romania was awarded the Order of Victory (the highest Soviet order) for overthrowing the pro-German Marshal Antonescu in the August 23 coup. The Armistice Agreement with Rumania, signed on September 12, 1944, established, among others, the following: *Article 1 \\"As from August 24, 1944, at four a.m., Rumania has entirely discontinued military operations against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on all theaters of war, has withdrawn from the war against the United Nations, has broken off relations with Germany and her satellites, has entered the war and will wage war on the side of the Allied Powers against Germany and Hungary for the purpose of restoring Rumanian independence and sovereignty, for which purpose she provides not less than twelve infantry divisions with corps troops.\\" *Article 4 \\"The state frontier between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Rumania, established by the Soviet-Rumanian Agreement of June 8, 1940, is restored.\\" *Article 18 \\"An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake until the conclusion of peace the regulation of and control over the execution of the present terms under the general direction and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf of the Allied Powers\\". In the Annex to Article 18, it was made clear that \\"The Romanian Government and their organs shall fulfill all instructions of the Allied Control Commission arising out of the Armistice Agreement.\\" and that the Allied Control Commission would have its seat in Bucharest. *Article 19 \\"The Allied Governments regard the decision of the Vienna award regarding Transylvania as void and are agreed that Transylvania the greater part thereof) [sic] should be returned to Rumania, subject to confirmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Rumania against Germany and Hungary.\\" In line with Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement two Romanian People's Tribunals were set up to try suspected war criminals. The Treaty of Peace with Romania was signed on February 10, 1947, and entered into force on September 15, 1947.Treaty of Peace with Romania, Avalon Project, Yale University Retrieved 2008-12-28 The Commission, placed under the nominal leadership of Soviet general Rodion Malinovsky (represented by Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov) and was dominated by Red Army leaders. The Commission was one of the tools used by the Soviet Union to impose communist rule in Romania. Soviet occupation forces remained in Romania until 1958 and the country became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, joining the Warsaw Pact and COMECON. Finland In Helsinki the Allied Control Commission occupied the Hotel Torni. The Allied Control Commission (ACC) arrived in Finland on September 22, 1944, to observe Finnish compliance with the Moscow armistice. It consisted of 200 Soviet and 15 British members and was led by Col. Gen. Andrei Zhdanov. As the commission was virtually entirely controlled by the Soviets, it was even officially referred to as the Allied (Soviet) Control Commission (Liittoutuneiden (Neuvostoliiton) valvontakomissio in Finnish).S. Zetterberg & A. Tiitta: \\"Suomi kautta aikojen\\", p. 457 Immediately after its inception, the commission required Finland to take more vigorous action to intern the German forces in Northern Finland. Finland's compliance with the commission resulted in a campaign to force out the remaining German troops in the area. Simultaneously, the Commission also required Finland to demobilize.Armistice Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,on the one hand, and Finland on the other The ACC provided Finland with a list of political leaders against whom Finland had to start judicial proceedings. This required Finnish ex post facto legislation. The ACC interfered with the war-responsibility trials by requiring longer prison sentences than the preliminary verdict would have contained. The ACC also strove to change the Finnish political life by requiring a number of allegedly fascist (in practice anti-Soviet) organizations to be banned, among them the Civil Guard. Furthermore, the ACC required the forced return of all Soviet citizens, including Ingrian Finns and Estonians, to the Soviet Union. After the war, the Finnish military placed part of the weapons of the demobilized troops into several hundred caches distributed around the country. The caches would have been used to arm guerillas in case of a Soviet occupation.S. Zetterberg & A. Tiitta: \\"Suomi kautta aikojen\\", p. 459 When the matter was leaked to the public, the commission required Finnish authorities to investigate and prosecute the officers and men responsible for the caching. The Weapons Cache Case was followed closely until the ACC determined that the case was purely a military operation. The Allied Control Commission left Finland September 26, 1947, when the Soviet Union finally ratified the Paris Peace Treaty. Bulgaria The Armistice Agreement with Bulgaria October 28, 1944 * Article 1: \\"On the conclusion of hostilities against Germany the Bulgarian armed forces must be demobilized and put on a peace footing under: supervision of the Allied Control Commission.\\". * Article 11: property taken from United Nations territory must be returned to those territories under the supervision of the Control Commission. * Article 13: property belonging to the Axis powers of Germany and Hungary must not be returned without permission of the Control Commission. * Article 18: the Commission would \\"regulate and supervise the execution of the armistice terms under the chairmanship of the representative of the Allied (Soviet) High Command. ...

The United States representatives on the Commission for Bulgaria were Major General John A. Crane (October 28, 1944 ‚Äì March 1, 1946) and Major General Walter M. Robertson (March 1, 1946 ‚Äì September 10, 1947).

Key (January 20, 1945 - July 4, 1946) and Brigadier General George H. Weems (July 5, 1946 ‚Äì September 15, 1947). Germany The Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany oversaw the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany. The ACC was established by agreement of June 5, 1945, supplemented by agreement of September 20 of that same year, with its seat in Berlin. Its members were Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. Decisions could only be made by consensus. From the outset; proceedings were heavily compromised through systematic non-cooperation from the French representatives. The French had been excluded (at American insistence) from the Potsdam Conference and consequently refused to recognise any obligation for the ACC to be constrained by the Potsdam agreement. In particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government. Cooperation within the ACC finally broke down completely when the Soviet representative withdrew on March 20, 1948. Until 1971, the ACC did not meet again, and the stage was set for the partition of Germany into two states. After the breakdown of the ACC, the British, French and United States of America occupation zones and the British, French and United States of America sectors in Berlin were governed by the Allied High Commission with membership from Britain, France, and the United States, whilst the Soviet Zone and Soviet sector of Berlin were governed by the Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission, later the Soviet High Commissioner. The role of the High Commissioners ceased when the three western zones (other than Berlin) and the Soviet Zone (other than in Berlin) acquired de facto sovereignty as respectively the Federal Republic of Germany ('West Germany') and the German Democratic Republic ('East Germany') (subject to certain restrictions). The ACC convened again in 1971, leading to agreement on transit arrangements in Berlin. During the talks for unification of Germany in late 1989, it was decided to convene the ACC again as a forum for solving the issue of Allied rights and privileges in Germany. The disbanding of the ACC was officially announced by the Two Plus Four Agreement of September 12, 1990, effective as of March 15, 1991. The ACC last met on 2 October 1990, on the eve of German Reunification. Austria The creation of an Allied Commission for Austria was envisaged by Allied leaders at the various sessions of the European Advisory Commission in 1944. The matter became more pressing following the Soviet takeover of Vienna from German control on April 13, 1945. The Soviet authorities in Vienna decided to establish a new Austrian government without prior consultation with the other Allied leaders, and on April 27, the Austrian socialist leader Karl Renner formed a government in Vienna. The British, US and French governments refused at first to recognize the Renner government, and in order to undermine the Soviet move decided to start right away with the proceedings to establish a joint commission for Austria. However, the Soviet government withheld permission for Allied representatives to enter Vienna during late April to early May, arguing that agreement on partition of Vienna into four occupation zones must be done prior to the arrival of any other troops thereto.US Charge d'Affaire in the USSR (George Kennan) to the US Secretary of State (Joseph C. Grew), May 7, 1945, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1945, vol. III, pp. 116-117 As a result, it was only on June 4 that a delegation of US, British and French generals was able to arrive at Vienna to survey conditions in the area. However, not much progress was made throughout June, as the Soviet authorities restricted the movement of the western Allies in and around Vienna. Throughout June, negotiations for agreement on division of Austria into occupation zones were held in London within the European Advisory Commission, and the agreement was concluded on July 4, 1945, subject to further approval. The agreement was then approved by the four Allied governments. On July 12, it was approved by the British and French governments. On July 21, the Soviet government gave its approval, and the US government followed suit on July 24. On June 27, 1945, shortly prior to the formation of the Allied Commission for Austria, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an ordinance authorizing General Mark W. Clark as Commander in Chief of US Forces of Occupation in Austria. Regarding the future commission for Austria, the directive stated: The Allied Commission for Austria was established by the Agreement on Control Machinery in Austria, signed in the European Advisory Commission in London on July 4, 1945. It entered into force on July 24, 1945, on the day that the United States gave notification of approval, the last of the four powers to do so. It was supplemented by an agreement of June 28, 1946, which enabled the Austrian government to conduct foreign relations. A separate agreement for the division of the city of Vienna into four occupation zones was concluded on July 9, 1945. This agreement was approved by the British government on July 12, the French government on July 16, the Soviet government on July 21 and the US government on July 24. Austria was divided into four zones: American, British, French and Soviet. Vienna, being the capital, was similarly divided but at its centre was an International Zone, sovereignty of which alternated at regular intervals between the four powers. The commission had its seat in Vienna. A problem faced by the commission was the issue of the provisional government under Karl Renner, which was established unilaterally by the Soviet government in early May 1945. The other Allied governments refused at first to recognize it, but on October 1, 1945, the commission made the following recommendation: The commission recommended the recognition of Renner's government in exchange for the introduction of freedom of the press and the holding of free elections. The commission for Austria was dismantled following the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty on May 15, 1955. Japan It was agreed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, and made public in communique issued at the end of the conference on December 27, 1945, that the Far Eastern Advisory Commission (FEAC) would become the Far Eastern Commission (FEC), it would be based in Washington, and would oversee the Allied Council for Japan. This arrangement was similar to those that the Allies had set up for overseeing the defeated Axis powers in Europe. In a mirror image of those Axis countries, like Hungary, which fell to the Soviet Union and were occupied by the Red Army alone, Japan having fallen to the United States and occupied by the U.S. Army, the United States was given the dominant position on the Tokyo- based Allied Council for Japan. The change in name of the FEAC to FEC was significant because as the U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes reported after the Conference \\"As early as August 9 we invited the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and China to join with us in carrying out the objectives of the Potsdam Declaration and the Terms of Surrender for Japan. The Far Eastern Advisory Commission was established in October, but Great Britain had reservations regarding its advisory character, and the Soviet Union requested a decision regarding control machinery in Tokyo before joining the work of the Commission.\\".Interim Meeting of Foreign Ministers, Moscow: Report by Secretary Byrnes, December 30, 1945, on Moscow Meeting US proposals for The Far Eastern Advisory Commission Terms of Reference (SWNCC 65/7) August 21, 1945 As agreed in the communique the FEC and the Allied Council were dismantled following the Treaty of San Francisco on September 8, 1951.

He was one of the principal authors of the Lausanne Covenant in 1974. In 2005, Time magazine ranked Stott among the 100 most influential people in the world.  Life   Early life and education  John Robert Walmsley Stott was born on 27 April 1921 in London, England, to Sir Arnold and Emily \\"Lily\\" Stott (n√©e Holland). His father was a leading physician at Harley Street and an agnostic, while his mother had been raised Lutheran and attended the nearby Church of England church, All Souls, Langham Place. Stott was sent to boarding schools at eight years old, initially to a prep school, Oakley Hall. In 1935, he went on to Rugby School. While at Rugby School in 1938, Stott heard Eric Nash (nicknamed \\"Bash\\") deliver a sermon entitled \\"What Then Shall I Do with Jesus, Who Is Called the Christ?\\" After this talk, Nash pointed Stott to Revelation 3:20, \\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\" Stott later described the impact this verse had upon him as follows: Stott was mentored by Nash, who wrote a weekly letter to him, advising him on how to develop and grow in his Christian life, as well as practicalities such as leading the Christian Union at his school. At this time, also, Stott was a pacifist and a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. In later life he withdrew from pacifism, adopting a 'just war' stance. Stott studied modern languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with double first-class honours in French and theology. At university, he was active in the Cambridge Inter- Collegiate Christian Union, where the executive committee considered him too invaluable a person to be asked to commit his time by joining the committee. After Trinity he transferred to Ridley Hall Theological College, Cambridge, to train for ordination as an Anglican cleric.  Ministry  Stott was ordained as a deacon in 1945 and became a curate at All Souls Church, Langham Place (1945‚Äì1950), then rector (1950‚Äì1975). This was the church in which he had grown up and where he spent almost his whole life apart from a few years spent in Cambridge. While in this position he became increasingly influential on a national and international basis, most notably being a key player in the 1966‚Äì1967 dispute about the appropriateness of evangelicals remaining in the Church of England. In 1970, in response to increasing demands on his time from outside the All Souls congregation, he appointed a vicar of All Souls, to enable himself to work on other projects. In 1975 Stott resigned as rector and Michael Baughen, was appointed in his place; Stott remained at the church and was appointed rector emeritus. In 1974 he founded Langham Partnership International (known as John Stott Ministries in the US until 2012), and in 1982 the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity, of which he remained honorary president until his death. During his presidency he gathered together leading evangelical intellectuals to shape courses and programmes communicating the Christian faith into a secular context. He was regularly accompanied by a leading paediatrician, John Wyatt, and the institute director, the broadcaster Elaine Storkey, when they spoke across the country to large audiences on \\"Matters of Life and Death\\". Following his chairmanship of the second National Evangelical Anglican Congress in April 1977, the Nottingham statement was published which said, \\"Seeing ourselves and Roman Catholics as fellow-Christians, we repent of attitudes that have seemed to deny it.\\" This aroused controversy amongst some evangelicals at the time.  Retirement and death  Stott announced his retirement from public ministry in April 2007 at the age of 86. He took up residence in the College of St Barnabas, Lingfield, Surrey, a retirement community for Anglican clergy but remained as Rector Emeritus of All Souls Church. Stott died on 27 July 2011 at the College of St Barnabas in Lingfield at 3:15 pm local time. He was surrounded by family and close friends and they were reading the Bible and listening to Handel's Messiah when he peacefully died. An obituary in Christianity Today reported that his death was due to age-related complications and that he had been in discomfort for several weeks. The obituary described him as \\"An architect of 20th-century evangelicalism [who] shaped the faith of a generation.\\" His status was such that his death was reported in the secular media. The BBC referred to him as someone who could \\"explain complex theology in a way lay people could easily understand\\". Obituaries were published in The Daily Telegraph and The New York Times. Tributes were paid to Stott by a number of leaders and other figures within the Christian community. The American evangelist Billy Graham released a statement saying, \\"The evangelical world has lost one of its greatest spokesmen, and I have lost one of my close personal friends and advisors. I look forward to seeing him again when I go to heaven.\\" The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams wrote: Stott's funeral was on 8 August 2011 at All Souls Church. It was reported that the church was full with people queuing for a considerable time before the service started. A memorial website remembrance book (closed 2017) attracted comments from over one thousand individuals. Memorial services for Stott were held at St Paul's Cathedral, London; Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, New Zealand; St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, Australia; College Church, Wheaton, Illinois, United States; Anglican Network Church of the Good Shepherd, Vancouver, Canada; St. Paul's Bloor Street, Toronto, Canada; as well as in cities across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Upon his death, he was cremated, his ashes were interred at Dale Cemetery, in Pembrokeshire, Wales.  Influence  Stott has had considerable influence in evangelicalism. In a November 2004 editorial on Stott, the New York Times columnist David Brooks cited Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center as saying that \\"if evangelicals could elect a pope, Stott is the person they would likely choose.\\"  Writing  He wrote over 50 books, some of which appear only in Chinese, Korean, or Spanish, as well as many articles and papers. One of these is Basic Christianity, a book which seeks to explain the message of Christianity, and convince its readers of its truth and importance. The Preacher's Portrait: Some New Testament Word Studies, published in 1961, it was an important reference for clergy. He was also the author of The Cross of Christ (), of which J. I. Packer stated, \\"No other treatment of this supreme subject says so much so truly and so well.\\" Other books he wrote include Essentials: A Liberal‚ÄìEvangelical Dialogue, a dialogue with the liberal cleric and theologian David L. Edwards, over whether what evangelicals hold as essential should be seen as such. In 2005, he produced Evangelical Truth, which summarises what he perceives as being the central claims of Christianity, essential for evangelicalism. Upon his formal retirement from public engagements, he continued to engage in regular writing until his death. In 2008, he produced The Anglican Evangelical Doctrine of Infant Baptism with J. Alec Motyer. An introduction to his thought can be found in his two final substantial publications, which act as a summation of his thinking. Both were published by the publishing house with which he had a lifelong association, IVP. * In 2007, his reflections on the life of the church: The Living Church: Convictions of a Lifelong Pastor. * In January 2010, at the age of 88, he saw the launch of what would explicitly be his final book: The Radical Disciple. It concludes with a poignant farewell and appeal for his legacy to be continued through the work of the Langham Partnership International.  Anglican evangelicalism  Stott played a key role as a leader of evangelicalism within the Church of England, and was regarded as instrumental in persuading evangelicals to play an active role in the Church of England rather than leaving for exclusively evangelical denominations. There were two major events where he played a key role in this regard. He was chairing the National Assembly of Evangelicals in 1966, a convention organised by the Evangelical Alliance, when Martyn Lloyd-Jones made an unexpected call for evangelicals to unite as evangelicals and no longer within their \\"mixed\\" denominations. This view was motivated by a belief that true Christian fellowship requires evangelical views on central topics such as the atonement and the inspiration of Scripture. Lloyd-Jones was a key figure to many in the free churches, and evangelical Anglicans regarded Stott similarly. The two leaders publicly disagreed, as Stott, though not scheduled as a speaker that evening, used his role as chairman to refute Lloyd-Jones, saying that his opinion went against history and the Bible. The following year saw the first National Evangelical Anglican Congress, which was held at Keele University. At this conference, largely due to Stott's influence, evangelical Anglicans committed themselves to full participation in the Church of England, rejecting the separationist approach proposed by Lloyd-Jones. These two conferences effectively fixed the direction of a large part of the British evangelical community. Although there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of Lloyd-Jones's views, they undoubtedly caused the two groupings to adopt diametrically opposed positions. These positions, and the resulting split, continue largely unchanged to this day.  Honours  Stott was appointed a Chaplain to Queen Elizabeth II in 1959 and, on his retirement in 1991, an Extra Chaplain. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the New Year Honours 2006. He received a Lambeth Doctorate of Divinity in 1983, as well as five honorary degrees, including doctorates from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (1971), Wycliffe College, Toronto (1993), and Brunel University (1997).  Annihilationism  Stott tentatively held to annihilationism, which is the view that the final state of the unsaved, known as hell, is death and destruction, rather than everlasting conscious torment. Stott said that: \\"the ultimate annihilation of the wicked should at least be accepted as a legitimate, biblically founded alternative to their eternal conscious torment.\\" Quoted in . This led to a heated debate within mainstream evangelical Christianity: some writers criticised Stott in very strong terms while others supported his views. Anti-Zionism Stott stated his firm opposition to Zionism: \\"Political Zionism and Christian Zionism are anathema to Christian faith ... The true Israel today is neither Jews nor Israelis, but believers in the Messiah, even if they are Gentiles ...\\" Personal life Stott remained celibate his entire life. He said, \\"The gift of singleness is more a vocation than an empowerment, although to be sure God is faithful in supporting those he calls.\\" Stott's favourite relaxation was birdwatching; his book The Birds Our Teachers draws on this interest.

It was previously one of eight districts of the two-tier Highland region, 1975 to 1996, and one of eight management areas of the Highland Council, 1996 to 2007. The district was created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 as one of the eight districts of the Highland region. The same legislation abolished counties and burghs as local government areas, and the Badenoch and Strathspey district was formed by combining the areas of (in the county of Inverness) the burgh of Kingussie and the district of Badenoch with (in the county of Moray) the burgh of Grantown-on-Spey and the district of Cromdale.Schedule 1, Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (c. 65) as enacted The traditional area of Strathspey was thus divided between the Highland region and the Grampian region. In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the Highland Region became the Highland Council Area and the districts were abolished. The Highland Council (in law a new and different entity), as the successor authority, then adopted the areas of the former districts as management areas and created area committees to represent them. The Badenoch and Strathspey management and committee areas consisted of five out of the 72 Highland Council wards. Each ward elected one councillor by the first past the post system of election. In 1999, however, ward boundaries were redrawn but management area boundaries were not. As a result, area committees were named for, and made decisions for, areas which they did not exactly represent. The new Badenoch and Strathspey committee area consisted of five out of the 80 new Highland Council wards. New wards were created for elections in May 2007, under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. As the wards became effective for representational purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were re-organised. The Badenoch and Strathspey management area and the Badenoch and Strathspey area committee were therefore abolished. The new wards are much larger, each electing three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system; Badenoch and Strathspey is now a single ward, electing four of the council's 80 members, and a ward management area within the council's new Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey corporate management area. The new corporate area is one of three covering the council area. It consists of nine of the 22 wards of the council area, and the nine wards elect 34 of the council's members.

The 20% of Canadians whose native language is neither English nor French are either lumped into one of the two official languages according to their knowledge and usage of them, or are classified separately as allophones. According to the 2006 Census of Canada, the population of English-speaking Canadians is between 17,882,775 and 24,423,375, finding the population outside of this designation to be 23,805,130 individuals. #The areas of Canada that have an anglophone majority. This excludes the francophone province of Quebec in total, as well as most of New Brunswick, Northern, and Eastern Ontario, Winnipeg, and other pockets of Western Canada. Consequently, usage is usually in the context of geopolitical discussions involving Quebec, whereby English Canada is often referred to as the \\"ROC\\" (Rest of Canada) so as to avoid the two-nations theory, which believes that English Canada is one of two founding nations along with French Canada (i.e. Quebec). The expression has been used during the conscription crisis. #English Canadians, in some historical contexts, refers to Canadians who have origins in England, in contrast to Canadiens (i.e., French Canadians or Canadien[ne]s fran√ßais[es]), Scottish Canadians, Irish Canadians etc.  Canadians of English origin  Estimates of Canadians with origins described as English is estimated to be about six million; a precise number is difficult to estimate for several reasons. Another 6.7 million people reported their ethnicity as simply \\"Canadian\\" without further specification, which would include those with an admixture of multiple ethnicities, particularly those long present in Canada (e.g. French, Irish, English, and Scottish), making it possible that the number is much higher than the nearly 6 million who reported as having English origins. On the other hand, historically, there have also been numerous Canadians who have hidden their true ancestry for different political reasons to join the dominant English group, such as to avoid discrimination, as seems to have been the case of the reported German-origin population, which dropped by nearly half after the First World War with a commensurate rise in reports of English origins.

PGD is considered in a similar fashion to prenatal diagnosis. When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective abortion, as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology, and requires in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development. The world's first PGD was performed by Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of X-linked disease, resulting in two twins and one singleton pregnancy. The term preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) refers to the set of techniques for testing whether embryos (obtained through IVF/ICSI) have abnormal chromosomes' number. In other words, it tests if embryo is aneuploid or not. PGS is also called aneuploidy screening. PGS was renamed preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy (PGD-A) by Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society (PGDIS) in 2016. The PGD allows studying the DNA of eggs or embryos to select those that carry certain mutations for genetic diseases. It is useful when there are previous chromosomal or genetic disorders in the family and within the context of in vitro fertilization programs.How does DGP work? Infographic Retrieved 28. June 2015 The procedures may also be called preimplantation genetic profiling to adapt to the fact that they are sometimes used on oocytes or embryos prior to implantation for other reasons than diagnosis or screening.Page 205 in: Procedures performed on sex cells before fertilization may instead be referred to as methods of oocyte selection or sperm selection, although the methods and aims partly overlap with PGD. History In 1968, Robert Edwards and Richard Gardner reported the successful identification of the sex of rabbit blastocysts. It was not until the 1980s that human IVF was fully developed, which coincided with the breakthrough of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Handyside, Kontogianni and Winston's first successful tests happened in October 1989, with the first births in 1990 though the preliminary experiments had been published some years earlier. In these first cases, PCR was used for sex determination of patients carrying X-linked diseases.  The first clinical cases  Elena Kontogianni was studying for her PhD at the Hammersmith Hospital, on single-cell PCR for sexing, which she did by amplifying a repeated region of the Y chromosome. It was this approach that she used for the world's first PGD cases. Female embryos were selectively transferred in five couples at risk of X-linked disease, resulting in two twins and one singleton pregnancy. Because the Y chromosome region Kontogianni was amplifying contained many repeats, it was more efficient than trying to amplify a unique region. A band on the PCR gel indicated that the embryo was male and the absence of a band indicated that the embryo was female. However, amplification failure or an anucleate blastomere also resulted in absence of a band on the PCR gel. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, Kontogianni went on to co-amplify sequences on the X and Y (Kontogianni et al., 1991).Kontogianni, E. H., Hardy, K. and Handyside, A. H. (1991). \\"Co-amplification of X- and Y-specific sequences for sexing human preimplantation embryos\\". In ¬´Proceedings of the First Symposium on Preimplantation Genetics¬ª, pp 139‚Äì142. Plenum, New York At that time nothing was known about allele dropout, cumulus cell contamination, or amplification failure from single cells. During the 1980s, human IVF embryos were exclusively transferred on day two of development as the culture medium used was incapable of reliably growing embryos past this stage. Since the biopsy was to be performed on day three, the first diagnoses were all performed in one day, with transfer of the embryos late on day three. A comparison of day two and day three transfers indicated that this would not adversely affect pregnancy rates. The worry of embryos arresting was so high that some transfers took place in the early hours of day four so that the embryos were removed from culture as soon as possible. There were many evenings at the Hammersmith when a transfer was performed at 1 a.m. on day four and researchers returned to the laboratory at 7 a.m. to start the next case. Winston helped deliver most of the first PGD babies. PGD became increasingly popular during the 1990s when it was used to determine a handful of severe genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anemia, Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and beta-thalassemia. Society As with all medical interventions associated with human reproduction, PGD raises strong, often conflicting opinions of social acceptability, particularly due to its eugenic implications. In some countries, such as Germany, PGD is permitted for only preventing stillbirths and genetic diseases, in other countries PGD is permitted in law but its operation is controlled by the state. Indications and applications PGD is used primarily for genetic disease prevention, by selecting only those embryos that do not have a known genetic disorder. PGD may also be used to increase chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection. Monogenic disorders PGD is available for a large number of monogenic disorders‚Äîthat is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)‚Äîor of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease; and in the case of the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously. PGD is also now being performed in a disease called hereditary multiple exostoses (MHE/MO/HME). In addition, there are infertile couples who carry an inherited condition and who opt for PGD as it can be easily combined with their IVF treatment. Pregnancy chances Preimplantation genetic profiling (PGP) has been suggested as a method to determine embryo quality in in vitro fertilization, in order to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, as the results of PGP rely on the assessment of a single cell, PGP has inherent limitations as the tested cell may not be representative of the embryo because of mosaicism. Furthermore, a study found that diagnoses of the biopsies from the same embryos at two separate laboratories matched up only 50% of the time. A systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomized controlled trials came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGP as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGP significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and chromosomal mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGP. Normal live births of healthy offspring after transfers of embryos deemed aneuploid by PGP have been reported worldwide. Alternative methods to determine embryo quality for prediction of pregnancy rates include microscopy as well as profiling of RNA and protein expression. HLA matching Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of embryos, so that the child's HLA matches a sick sibling, availing for cord-blood stem cell donation.(Pattinson 2003) The child is in this sense a \\"savior sibling\\" for the recipient child. HLA typing has meanwhile become an important PGD indication in those countries where the law permits it. The HLA matching can be combined with the diagnosis for monogenic diseases such as Fanconi anaemia or beta thalassemia in those cases where the ailing sibling is affected with this disease, or it may be exceptionally performed on its own for cases such as children with leukaemia. The main ethical argument against is the possible exploitation of the child, although some authors maintain that the Kantian imperative is not breached since the future donor child will not only be a donor but also a loved individual within the family. Cancer predisposition A more recent application of PGD is to diagnose late-onset diseases and (cancer) predisposition syndromes. Since affected individuals remain healthy until the onset of the disease, frequently in the fourth decade of life, there is debate on whether or not PGD is appropriate in these cases. Considerations include the high probability of developing the disorders and the potential for cures. For example, in predisposition syndromes, such as BRCA mutations which predispose the individual to breast cancer, the outcomes are unclear. Although PGD is often regarded as an early form of prenatal diagnosis, the nature of the requests for PGD often differs from those of prenatal diagnosis requests made when the mother is already pregnant. Some of the widely accepted indications for PGD would not be acceptable for prenatal diagnosis. Sex discernment Preimplantation genetic diagnosis provides a method of prenatal sex discernment even before implantation, and may therefore be termed preimplantation sex discernment. Potential applications of preimplantation sex discernment include: *A complement to specific gene testing for monogenic disorders, which can be very useful for genetic diseases whose presentation is linked to the sex, such as, for example, X-linked diseases. *Ability to prepare for any sex-dependent aspects of parenting. *Sex selection. A 2006 survey found that 42 per cent of clinics that offer PGD have provided it for sex selection for non-medical reasons. Nearly half of these clinics perform it only for \\"family balancing\\", which is where a couple with two or more children of one sex desire a child of the other, but half do not restrict sex selection to family balancing. In India, this practice has been used to select only male embryos although this practice is illegal.(PNDT ACT NO. 57 OF 1994) Opinions on whether sex selection for non-medical reasons is ethically acceptable differ widely, as exemplified by the fact that the ESHRE Task Force could not formulate a uniform recommendation. In the case of families at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment. Minor disabilities A 2006 survey reveals that PGD has occasionally been used to select an embryo for the presence of a particular disease or disability, such as deafness, in order that the child would share that characteristic with the parents. Technical aspects PGD is a form of genetic diagnosis performed prior to implantation. This implies that the patient's oocytes should be fertilized in vitro and the embryos kept in culture until the diagnosis is established. It is also necessary to perform a biopsy on these embryos in order to obtain material on which to perform the diagnosis. The diagnosis itself can be carried out using several techniques, depending on the nature of the studied condition. Generally, PCR-based methods are used for monogenic disorders and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities and for sexing those cases in which no PCR protocol is available for an X-linked disease. These techniques need to be adapted to be performed on blastomeres and need to be thoroughly tested on single-cell models prior to clinical use. Finally, after embryo replacement, surplus good quality unaffected embryos can be cryopreserved, to be thawed and transferred back in a next cycle. Obtaining embryos Currently, all PGD embryos are obtained by assisted reproductive technology, although the use of natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted in the past and is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient's profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17 mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600 ¬µg of natural micronized progesterone. Oocytes are carefully denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells can be a source of contamination during the PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In the majority of the reported cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used instead of IVF. The main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16‚Äì18 hours after. The embryo development is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman's uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily on the basis of the number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation rate of the blastomeres. On day 4, embryos were scored in function of their degree of compaction and blastocysts were evaluated according to the quality of the throphectoderm and inner cell mass, and their degree of expansion. Biopsy procedures As PGD can be performed on cells from different developmental stages, the biopsy procedures vary accordingly. Theoretically, the biopsy can be performed at all preimplantation stages, but only three have been suggested: on unfertilised and fertilised oocytes (for polar bodies, PBs), on day three cleavage-stage embryos (for blastomeres) and on blastocysts (for trophectoderm cells). The biopsy procedure always involves two steps: the opening of the zona pellucida and the removal of the cell(s). There are different approaches to both steps, including mechanical, chemical, and physical (Tyrode's acidic solution) and laser technology for the breaching of the zona pellucida, extrusion or aspiration for the removal of PBs and blastomeres, and herniation of the trophectoderm cells. Polar body biopsy A polar body biopsy is the sampling of a polar body, which is a small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally does not have the ability to be fertilized. Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of maternally inherited autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are exclusively maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies. Cleavage-stage biopsy (blastomere biopsy) Cleavage-stage biopsy is generally performed the morning of day three post-fertilization, when normally developing embryos reach the eight-cell stage. The biopsy is usually performed on embryos with less than 50% of anucleated fragments and at an 8-cell or later stage of development. A hole is made in the zona pellucida and one or two blastomeres containing a nucleus are gently aspirated or extruded through the opening. The main advantage of cleavage-stage biopsy over PB analysis is that the genetic input of both parents can be studied. On the other hand, cleavage-stage embryos are found to have a high rate of chromosomal mosaicism, putting into question whether the results obtained on one or two blastomeres will be representative for the rest of the embryo. It is for this reason that some programs utilize a combination of PB biopsy and blastomere biopsy. Furthermore, cleavage-stage biopsy, as in the case of PB biopsy, yields a very limited amount of tissue for diagnosis, necessitating the development of single-cell PCR and FISH techniques. Although theoretically PB biopsy and blastocyst biopsy are less harmful than cleavage-stage biopsy, this is still the prevalent method. It is used in approximately 94% of the PGD cycles reported to the ESHRE PGD Consortium. The main reasons are that it allows for a safer and more complete diagnosis than PB biopsy and still leaves enough time to finish the diagnosis before the embryos must be replaced in the patient's uterus, unlike blastocyst biopsy. Of all cleavage-stages, it is generally agreed that the optimal moment for biopsy is at the eight-cell stage. It is diagnostically safer than the PB biopsy and, unlike blastocyst biopsy, it allows for the diagnosis of the embryos before day 5. In this stage, the cells are still totipotent and the embryos are not yet compacting. Although it has been shown that up to a quarter of a human embryo can be removed without disrupting its development, it still remains to be studied whether the biopsy of one or two cells correlates with the ability of the embryo to further develop, implant and grow into a full term pregnancy. Not all methods of opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the well-being of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method of opening the zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues. Blastocyst biopsy In an attempt to overcome the difficulties related to single-cell techniques, it has been suggested to biopsy embryos at the blastocyst stage, providing a larger amount of starting material for diagnosis. It has been shown that if more than two cells are present in the same sample tube, the main technical problems of single-cell PCR or FISH would virtually disappear. On the other hand, as in the case of cleavage-stage biopsy, the chromosomal differences between the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm (TE) can reduce the accuracy of diagnosis, although this mosaicism has been reported to be lower than in cleavage-stage embryos. TE biopsy has been shown to be successful in animal models such as rabbits, mice and primates. These studies show that the removal of some TE cells is not detrimental to the further in vivo development of the embryo. Human blastocyst-stage biopsy for PGD is performed by making a hole in the ZP on day three of in vitro culture. This allows the developing TE to protrude after blastulation, facilitating the biopsy. On day five post- fertilization, approximately five cells are excised from the TE using a glass needle or laser energy, leaving the embryo largely intact and without loss of inner cell mass. After diagnosis, the embryos can be replaced during the same cycle, or cryopreserved and transferred in a subsequent cycle. There are two drawbacks to this approach, due to the stage at which it is performed. First, only approximately half of the preimplantation embryos reach the blastocyst stage. This can restrict the number of blastocysts available for biopsy, limiting in some cases the success of the PGD. Mc Arthur and coworkers report that 21% of the started PGD cycles had no embryo suitable for TE biopsy. This figure is approximately four times higher than the average presented by the ESHRE PGD consortium data, where PB and cleavage-stage biopsy are the predominant reported methods. On the other hand, delaying the biopsy to this late stage of development limits the time to perform the genetic diagnosis, making it difficult to redo a second round of PCR or to rehybridize FISH probes before the embryos should be transferred back to the patient. Cumulus cell sampling Sampling of cumulus cells can be performed in addition to a sampling of polar bodies or cells from the embryo. Because of the molecular interactions between cumulus cells and the oocyte, gene expression profiling of cumulus cells can be performed to estimate oocyte quality and the efficiency of an ovarian hyperstimulation protocol, and may indirectly predict aneuploidy, embryo development and pregnancy outcomes. Non-Invasive Preimplantation Genetic Screening Methods (NIPGS) Traditional embryo biopsy can be invasive and costly. Therefore, researchers have an ongoing quest to find a less invasive methods for preimplantation genetic testing. Studies on new non-invasive preimplantation genetics screening methods (NIPGS) such as blastocoel fluid and spent embryo media have recently been published as an alternative to traditional methods Kuznyetsov, V., Madjunkova, S., Antes, R., Abramov, R., Motamedi, G., Ibarrientos, Z., & Librach, C. (2018). Evaluation of a novel non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening approach. PloS one, 13(5), e0197262 Preimplantation Genetic Screening Testing using Blastocoel Fluid (BF) During a normal IVF process, good practice to vitrify embryos increases the chance of a healthy pregnancy. During the process of vitrification a developed blast is dehydrated and it and its blastocoel cavity collapses for the freezing process. There are many methods that have been used to facilitate the collapse including laser-pulse, repeated micropipetting, microneedle puncture or microsuction Darwish, E., & Magdi, Y. (2016). Artificial shrinkage of blastocoel using a laser pulse prior to vitrification improves clinical outcome. Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics, 33(4), 467-471. Normally this fluid would then be discarded, however with preimplantation genetic testing of BL, this fluid is saved and then tested for DNA. This DNA is thought to be from cells that have gone through apoptosis found in the developing embryo Kuznyetsov, V., Madjunkova, S., Antes, R., Abramov, R., Motamedi, G., Ibarrientos, Z., & Librach, C. (2018). Evaluation of a novel non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening approach. PloS one, 13(5), e0197262 Preimplantation Genetic Testing using Blastocyst Culture Conditioned Medium (BCCM) Another method for less invasive preimplantation genetic testing involves testing the culture media the embryo has developed in. It has been noted that the embryo releases DNA fragments from the cells that have died within the incubation period. With this knowledge, scientists have reasoned that they could isolate this DNA and use it for preimplantation genetic testing Kuznyetsov, V., Madjunkova, S., Antes, R., Abramov, R., Motamedi, G., Ibarrientos, Z., & Librach, C. (2018). Evaluation of a novel non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening approach. PloS one, 13(5), e0197262 The benefits and Consequences of less invasive pre implantation genetic testing While there's conflicting evidence as to whether or not the more traditional methods of preimplantation genetic testing are harmful to the embryo there is newer methods for less invasive and equally effective testing methods. To that effect we have turned to preimplantation genetic testing using blastocoel fluid and spent embryo media. One problem to these alternatives are the minimal amount of DNA there is to work with. Another very important question is whether or not this technology is accurate. Both of these concerns were recently addressed by Kuznyetsov. Kuznyetsov decided to use both methods combining the amount of DNA retrieved from both techniques. Then once the DNA was isolated it was used for preimplantation genetic testing. The results showed that when both methods Blastocyst Fluid and Embryo Spent Media were used in combination they showed a cordance rate for the whole chromosome copy of 87.5% when compared to the trophectoderm, 96.4% when compared to the whole Blastocyst (gold standard). Additionally after amplification using this new method they were able to produce 25.0-54.0 ng/ul of DNA per sample. With traditional methods such as trophectoderm they collected 10 to 44 ng/ul Kuznyetsov, V., Madjunkova, S., Antes, R., Abramov, R., Motamedi, G., Ibarrientos, Z., & Librach, C. (2018). Evaluation of a novel non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening approach. PloS one, 13(5), e0197262 Genetic analysis techniques Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the two commonly used, first- generation technologies in PGD. PCR is generally used to diagnose monogenic disorders and FISH is used for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities (for instance, aneuploidy screening or chromosomal translocations). Over the past few years, various advancements in PGD testing have allowed for an improvement in the comprehensiveness and accuracy of results available depending on the technology used. Recently a method was developed allowing to fix metaphase plates from single blastomeres. This technique in conjunction with FISH, m-FISH can produce more reliable results, since analysis is done on whole metaphase plates In addition to FISH and PCR, single cell genome sequencing is being tested as a method of preimplantation genetic diagnosis.Single-cell Sequencing Makes Strides in the Clinic with Cancer and PGD First Applications from Clinical Sequencing News. By Monica Heger. October 02, 2013 This characterizes the complete DNA sequence of the genome of the embryo. FISH FISH is the most commonly applied method to determine the chromosomal constitution of an embryo. In contrast to karyotyping, it can be used on interphase chromosomes, so that it can be used on PBs, blastomeres and TE samples. The cells are fixated on glass microscope slides and hybridised with DNA probes. Each of these probes are specific for part of a chromosome, and are labelled with a fluorochrome. Dual FISH was considered to be an efficient technique for determination of the sex of human preimplantation embryos and the additional ability to detect abnormal chromosome copy numbers, which is not possible via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Currently, a large panel of probes are available for different segments of all chromosomes, but the limited number of different fluorochromes confines the number of signals that can be analysed simultaneously. The type and number of probes that are used on a sample depends on the indication. For sex determination (used for instance when a PCR protocol for a given X-linked disorder is not available), probes for the X and Y chromosomes are applied along with probes for one or more of the autosomes as an internal FISH control. More probes can be added to check for aneuploidies, particularly those that could give rise to a viable pregnancy (such as a trisomy 21). The use of probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21 and 22 has the potential of detecting 70% of the aneuploidies found in spontaneous abortions. In order to be able to analyse more chromosomes on the same sample, up to three consecutive rounds of FISH can be carried out. In the case of chromosome rearrangements, specific combinations of probes have to be chosen that flank the region of interest. The FISH technique is considered to have an error rate between 5 and 10%. The main problem of the use of FISH to study the chromosomal constitution of embryos is the elevated mosaicism rate observed at the human preimplantation stage. A meta-analysis of more than 800 embryos came to the result that approximately 75% of preimplantation embryos are mosaic, of which approximately 60% are diploid‚Äìaneuploid mosaic and approximately 15% aneuploid mosaic. Li and co-workers found that 40% of the embryos diagnosed as aneuploid on day 3 turned out to have a euploid inner cell mass at day 6. Staessen and collaborators found that 17.5% of the embryos diagnosed as abnormal during PGS, and subjected to post-PGD reanalysis, were found to also contain normal cells, and 8.4% were found grossly normal. As a consequence, it has been questioned whether the one or two cells studied from an embryo are actually representative of the complete embryo, and whether viable embryos are not being discarded due to the limitations of the technique. PCR Kary Mullis conceived PCR in 1985 as an in vitro simplified reproduction of the in vivo process of DNA replication. Taking advantage of the chemical properties of DNA and the availability of thermostable DNA polymerases, PCR allows for the enrichment of a DNA sample for a certain sequence. PCR provides the possibility to obtain a large quantity of copies of a particular stretch of the genome, making further analysis possible. It is a highly sensitive and specific technology, which makes it suitable for all kinds of genetic diagnosis, including PGD. Currently, many different variations exist on the PCR itself, as well as on the different methods for the posterior analysis of the PCR products. When using PCR in PGD, one is faced with a problem that is inexistent in routine genetic analysis: the minute amounts of available genomic DNA. As PGD is performed on single cells, PCR has to be adapted and pushed to its physical limits, and use the minimum amount of template possible: which is one strand. This implies a long process of fine-tuning of the PCR conditions and a susceptibility to all the problems of conventional PCR, but several degrees intensified. The high number of needed PCR cycles and the limited amount of template makes single-cell PCR very sensitive to contamination. Another problem specific to single-cell PCR is the allele drop out (ADO) phenomenon. It consists of the random non-amplification of one of the alleles present in a heterozygous sample. ADO seriously compromises the reliability of PGD as a heterozygous embryo could be diagnosed as affected or unaffected depending on which allele would fail to amplify. This is particularly concerning in PGD for autosomal dominant disorders, where ADO of the affected allele could lead to the transfer of an affected embryo. Several PCR-based assays have been developed for various diseases like the triplet repeat genes associated with myotonic dystrophy and fragile X in single human somatic cells, gametes and embryos. Establishing a diagnosis The establishment of a diagnosis in PGD is not always straightforward. The criteria used for choosing the embryos to be replaced after FISH or PCR results are not equal in all centres. In the case of FISH, in some centres only embryos are replaced that are found to be chromosomally normal (that is, showing two signals for the gonosomes and the analysed autosomes) after the analysis of one or two blastomeres, and when two blastomeres are analysed, the results should be concordant. Other centres argue that embryos diagnosed as monosomic could be transferred, because the false monosomy (i.e. loss of one FISH signal in a normal diploid cell) is the most frequently occurring misdiagnosis. In these cases, there is no risk for an aneuploid pregnancy, and normal diploid embryos are not lost for transfer because of a FISH error. Moreover, it has been shown that embryos diagnosed as monosomic on day 3 (except for chromosomes X and 21), never develop to blastocyst, which correlates with the fact that these monosomies are never observed in ongoing pregnancies. Diagnosis and misdiagnosis in PGD using PCR have been mathematically modelled in the work of Navidi and Arnheim and of Lewis and collaborators. The most important conclusion of these publications is that for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of an embryo, two genotypes are required. This can be based on a linked marker and disease genotypes from a single cell or on marker/disease genotypes of two cells. An interesting aspect explored in these papers is the detailed study of all possible combinations of alleles that may appear in the PCR results for a particular embryo. The authors indicate that some of the genotypes that can be obtained during diagnosis may not be concordant with the expected pattern of linked marker genotypes, but are still providing sufficient confidence about the unaffected genotype of the embryo. Although these models are reassuring, they are based on a theoretical model, and generally the diagnosis is established on a more conservative basis, aiming to avoid the possibility of misdiagnosis. When unexpected alleles appear during the analysis of a cell, depending on the genotype observed, it is considered that either an abnormal cell has been analysed or that contamination has occurred, and that no diagnosis can be established. A case in which the abnormality of the analysed cell can be clearly identified is when, using a multiplex PCR for linked markers, only the alleles of one of the parents are found in the sample. In this case, the cell can be considered as carrying a monosomy for the chromosome on which the markers are located, or, possibly, as haploid. The appearance of a single allele that indicates an affected genotype is considered sufficient to diagnose the embryo as affected, and embryos that have been diagnosed with a complete unaffected genotype are preferred for replacement. Although this policy may lead to a lower number of unaffected embryos suitable for transfer, it is considered preferable to the possibility of a misdiagnosis. Preimplantation genetic haplotyping Preimplantation genetic haplotyping (PGH) is a PGD technique wherein a haplotype of genetic markers that have statistical associations to a target disease are identified rather than the mutation causing the disease. Once a panel of associated genetic markers have been established for a particular disease it can be used for all carriers of that disease. In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-specific tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable. PGH also has an advantage over FISH in that FISH is not usually able to make the differentiation between embryos that possess the balanced form of a chromosomal translocation and those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes. This inability can be seriously harmful to the diagnosis made. PGH can make the distinction that FISH often cannot. PGH does this by using polymorphic markers that are better suited at recognizing translocations. These polymorphic markers are able to distinguish between embryos that carried normal, balanced, and unbalanced translocations. FISH also requires more cell fixation for analysis whereas PGH requires only transfer of cells into polymerase chain reaction tubes. The cell transfer is a simpler method and leaves less room for analysis failure. Embryo transfer and cryopreservation of surplus embryos Embryo transfer is usually performed on day three or day five post-fertilization, the timing depending on the techniques used for PGD and the standard procedures of the IVF centre where it is performed. With the introduction in Europe of the single-embryo transfer policy, which aims at the reduction of the incidence of multiple pregnancies after ART, usually one embryo or early blastocyst is replaced in the uterus. Serum hCG is determined at day 12. If a pregnancy is established, an ultrasound examination at 7 weeks is performed to confirm the presence of a fetal heartbeat. Couples are generally advised to undergo PND because of the, albeit low, risk of misdiagnosis. It is not unusual that after the PGD, there are more embryos suitable for transferring back to the woman than necessary. For the couples undergoing PGD, those embryos are very valuable, as the couple's current cycle may not lead to an ongoing pregnancy. Embryo cryopreservation and later thawing and replacement can give them a second chance to pregnancy without having to redo the cumbersome and expensive ART and PGD procedures. Side effects to embryo PGD/PGS is an invasive procedure that requires a serious consideration, according to Michael Tucker, Ph.D., Scientific Director and Chief Embryologist at Georgia Reproductive Specialists in Atlanta. One of the risks of PGD includes damage to the embryo during the biopsy procedure (which in turn destroys the embryo as a whole), according to Serena H. Chen, M.D., a New Jersey reproductive endocrinologist with IRMS Reproductive Medicine at Saint Barnabas. Another risk is cryopreservation where the embryo is stored in a frozen state and thawed later for the procedure. About 20% of the thawed embryos do not survive. There has been a study indicating a biopsied embryo has a less rate of surviving cryopreservation. Another study suggests that PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy results in a significantly lower live birth rate for women of advanced maternal age. Also, another study recommends the caution and a long term follow-up as PGD/PGS increases the perinatal death rate in multiple pregnancies. In a mouse model study, PGD has been attributed to various long term risks including a weight gain and memory decline; a proteomic analysis of adult mouse brains showed significant differences between the biopsied and the control groups, of which many are closely associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers and Down syndrome. Ethical issues PGD has raised ethical issues, although this approach could reduce reliance on fetal deselection during pregnancy. The technique can be used for prenatal sex discernment of the embryo, and thus potentially can be used to select embryos of one sex in preference of the other in the context of \\"family balancing\\". It may be possible to make other \\"social selection\\" choices in the future that introduce socio-economic concerns. Only unaffected embryos are implanted in a woman's uterus; those that are affected are either discarded or donated to science. PGD has the potential to screen for genetic issues unrelated to medical necessity, such as intelligence and beauty, and against negative traits such as disabilities. The medical community has regarded this as a counterintuitive and controversial suggestion. The prospect of a \\"designer baby\\" is closely related to the PGD technique, creating a fear that increasing frequency of genetic screening will move toward a modern eugenics movement. On the other hand, a principle of procreative beneficence is proposed, which is a putative moral obligation of parents in a position to select their children to favor those expected to have the best life. An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are \\"all-purpose means\\" in the sense of being of instrumental value in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have. Walter Veit has argued that there is no intrinsic moral difference between 'creating' and 'choosing' a life, thus making eugenics a natural consequence of accepting the principle of procreative beneficence. Disabilities In 2006, three percent of PGD clinics in the US reported having selected an embryo for the presence of a disability. Couples involved were accused of purposely harming a child. This practice is notable in dwarfism, where parents intentionally create a child who is a dwarf. In the selection of a saviour sibling to provide a matching bone marrow transplant for an already existing affected child, there are issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child. By relying on the result of one cell from the multi-cell embryo, PGD operates under the assumption that this cell is representative of the remainder of the embryo. This may not be the case as the incidence of mosaicism is often relatively high. On occasion, PGD may result in a false negative result leading to the acceptance of an abnormal embryo, or in a false positive result leading to the deselection of a normal embryo. Another problematic case is the cases of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients do not wish to know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself. Intersex traits PGD allows discrimination against those with intersex traits. Georgiann Davis argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives. Morgan Carpenter highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of \\"serious\\" \\"genetic conditions\\" that may be de-selected in the UK, including 5 alpha reductase deficiency and androgen insensitivity syndrome, traits evident in elite women athletes and \\"the world's first openly intersex mayor\\". Organisation Intersex International Australia has called for the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council to prohibit such interventions, noting a \\"close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature\\". In 2015, the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper on Human rights and intersex people, remarking:  Savior Siblings  PGD combined with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) matching allows couples to select for embryos that are unaffected with a genetic disease in hopes of saving an existing, affected child. The \\"savior sibling\\" would conceivably donate life- saving tissue that is compatible to his/her brother or sister. Some ethicists argue that the \\"savior siblings\\" created from this procedure would be treated as commodities. Another argument against selecting for \\"savior siblings\\" is that it leads to genetically engineered \\"designer babies\\". This argument prompts a discussion between the moral distinction of enhancing traits and preventing disease. Finally, opponents of \\"savior siblings\\" are concerned with the welfare of the child, mainly that the procedure will cause emotional and psychological harm to the child. Currently in the United States, no formal regulation or guideline exists. The ethical decisions regarding this procedure is in the discretion of health care providers and their patients. In contrast, the UK's use of PGD is regulated by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act (HFEA), which requires clinics performing this technique to attain a license and follow strict criteria. Religious objections Some religious organizations disapprove of this procedure. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, takes the position that it involves the destruction of human life.ZENIT article and besides that, opposes the necessary in vitro fertilization of eggs as contrary to Aristotelian principles of nature. The Jewish Orthodox religion believes the repair of genetics is okay, but it does not support making a child which is genetically fashioned. Psychological factor A meta-analysis that was performed indicates research studies conducted in PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive attitudinal survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating no significant differences between those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the attitudinal survey, women with a history of infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first attitudinal study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; \\"those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss\\". In summary, although some of these studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study's results indicate an overall satisfaction of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation. Policy and legality Canada Prior to implementing the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHR) in 2004, PGD was unregulated in Canada. The Act banned sex selection for non-medical purposes. Due to 2012's national budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces with a lot of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of Reprogenetics, saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies. Ontario, however, has no concrete regulations regarding PGD. Since 2011, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services in Ontario advocates for the development government-funded 'safe fertility' education, embryo monitoring and assisted reproduction services for all Ontarians. This government report shows that Ontario not only has indefinite regulations regarding assisted reproduction services like IVF and PGD, but also does not fund any of these services. The reproductive clinics that exist are all private and located only in Brampton, Markham, Mississauga, Scarborough, Toronto, London and Ottawa. In contrast, provinces such as Alberta and Quebec not only have more clinics, but have also detailed laws regarding assisted reproduction and government funding for these practices. Germany Before 2010, the usage of PGD was in a legal grey area. In 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that PGD can be used in exceptional cases. On 7 July 2011, the Bundestag passed a law that allows PGD in certain cases. The procedure may only be used when there is a strong likelihood that parents will pass on a genetic disease, or when there is a high genetic chance of a stillbirth or miscarriage. On 1 February 2013, the Bundesrat approved a rule regulating how PGD can be used in practice. Hungary In Hungary, PGD is allowed in case of severe hereditary diseases (when genetic risk is above 10%). The preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy (PGS/PGD-A) is an accepted method as well. It is currently recommended in case of multiple miscarriages, and/or several failed IVF treatments, and/or when the mother is older than 35 years. Despite being an approved method, PGD-A is available at only one Fertility Clinic in Hungary.Wikipedia page: :hu:Versys Clinics India In India, Ministry of Family Health and Welfare, regulates the concept under ‚Äì Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994. The Act was further been revised after 1994 and necessary amendment were made are updated timely on the official website of the Indian Government dedicated for the cause. The use of PGD for sex identification/selection of child is illegal in India. Mexico As of 2006, clinics in Mexico legally provided PGD services. South Africa In South Africa, where the right to reproductive freedom is a constitutionally protected right, it has been proposed that the state can only limit PGD to the degree that parental choice can harm the prospective child or to the degree that parental choice will reinforce societal prejudice. Ukraine The preimplantation genetic diagnosis is allowed in Ukraine and from November 1, 2013 is regulated by the order of the Ministry of health of Ukraine \\"On approval of the application of assisted reproductive technologies in Ukraine\\" from 09.09.2013 No. 787. . United Kingdom In the UK, assisted reproductive technologies are regulated under the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act (HFE) of 2008. However, the HFE Act does not address issues surrounding PGD. Thus, the HFE Authority (HFEA) was created in 2003 to act as a national regulatory agency which issues licenses and monitors clinics providing PGD. The HFEA only permits the use of PGD where the clinic concerned has a licence from the HFEA and sets out the rules for this licensing in its Code of Practice (). Each clinic, and each medical condition, requires a separate application where the HFEA check the suitability of the genetic test proposed and the staff skills and facilities of the clinic. Only then can PGD be used for a patient. The HFEA strictly prohibits sex selection for social or cultural reasons, but allows it to avoid sex-linked disorders. They state that PGD is not acceptable for, \\"social or psychological characteristics, normal physical variations, or any other conditions which are not associated with disability or a serious medical condition.\\" It is however accessible to couples or individuals with a known family history of serious genetic diseases. Nevertheless, the HFEA regards intersex variations as a \\"serious genetic disease\\", such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a trait associated with some elite women athletes. Intersex advocates argue that such decisions are based on social norms of sex gender, and cultural reasons. United States No uniform system for regulation of assisted reproductive technologies, including genetic testing, exists in the United States. The practice and regulation of PGD most often falls under state laws or professional guidelines as the federal government does not have direct jurisdiction over the practice of medicine. To date, no state has implemented laws directly pertaining to PGD, therefore leaving researchers and clinicians to abide to guidelines set by the professional associations. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that all clinics providing IVF must report pregnancy success rates annually to the federal government, but reporting of PGD use and outcomes is not required. Professional organizations, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), have provided limited guidance on the ethical uses of PGD. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states that, \\"PGD should be regarded as an established technique with specific and expanding applications for standard clinical practice.\\" They also state, \\"While the use of PGD for the purpose of preventing sex-linked diseases is ethical, the use of PGD solely for sex selection is discouraged.\\" References in popular culture * PGD features prominently in the 1997 film Gattaca. The movie is set in a near-future world where PGD/IVF is the most common form of reproduction. In the movie parents routinely use PGD to select desirable traits for their children such as height, eye color and freedom from even the smallest of genetic predispositions to disease. The ethical consequences of PGD are explored through the story of the main character who faces discrimination because he was conceived without such methods. * PGD is mentioned in the 2004 novel My Sister's Keeper by the characters as the main character, Anna Fitzgerald, was created through PGD to be a genetic match for her APL positive sister Kate so that she could donate bone marrow at her birth to help Kate fight the APL. It is also mentioned in the book that her parents received criticism for the act. Information on clinic websites In a study of 135 IVF clinics, 88% had websites, 70% mentioned PGD and 27% of the latter were university- or hospital-based and 63% were private clinics. Sites mentioning PGD also mentioned uses and benefits of PGD far more than the associated risks. Of the sites mentioning PGD, 76% described testing for single-gene diseases, but only 35% mentioned risks of missing target diagnoses, and only 18% mentioned risks for loss of the embryo. 14% described PGD as new or controversial. Private clinics were more likely than other programs to list certain PGD risks like for example diagnostic error, or note that PGD was new or controversial, reference sources of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons.

The main offices of the Skye and Lochalsh district council were in Portree, on the Isle of Skye. History As statutory local government areas, the region and districts were created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. The area of the region is now the Highland unitary council area, and the former Skye and Lochalsh district is within the Highland Council's Ross, Skye and Lochaber corporate management area. The 1973 legislation abolished local government counties and burghs throughout Scotland and created a new system of nine two-tier regions and three islands council areas. Each region consisted of a number of districts and the islands areas were created as unitary council areas. The Skye and Lochash district of the Highland region was created by merging a district of the former county of Inverness (the Skye district, consisting of the Skye group of Inner Hebridean islands) with a district of the former county of Ross and Cromarty (the South West district, consisting of an area around and including the village of Kyle of Lochalsh). The 1994 legislation abolished regions and districts and established a system of 32 unitary council areas covering the whole of Scotland, and all of the Highland districts were merged into the new unitary Highland council area. In 1996 the new Highland Council adopted the areas of the former districts as council management areas, and created area committees to represent them. The Skye and Lochalsh management area then consisted of six out of the 72 wards of the council area, each electing one councillor by the first past the post system of election. In 1999 ward boundaries were redrawn to create 80 new wards. Management area boundaries were not redrawn, however, and therefore area committees ceased to represent exactly the areas for which they were named and made decisions. The Skye and Lochalsh committee continued to have six members. Ward boundaries were redrawn again in 2007, and the council's eight management areas were abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas, including the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area which absorbed the former Skye and Lochalsh area. The Highland council area now has 22 wards and each elects three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system, a system designed to produce a form of proportional representation. The total number of councillors remains the same. The Ross, Skye and Lochaber area consists of six out of the 22 wards and these ward elect 23 of the 80 Highland councillors. There is also a Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (at Westminster), but its boundaries are not exactly those of the council corporated management area. The constituency was created in 2005 with boundaries based on those of wards in use during the period 1999 to 2007. The Skye group of islands is now a ward named as the Eilean a' Che√≤ ward, which elects four councillors. The Lochalsh area is now within the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh ward, which also elects four councillors. Coat of arms of Skye and Lochalsh District Council  District coat of arms  The Skye and Lochalsh District Council coat of arms, granted by Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1987, featured a wavy blue fess across the centre of the shield for the Kyle of Lochalsh. Above this were emblems for the three main historic families of the Isle of Skye (Macleod of Macleod, Macdonald of Sleat and Mackinnon) and below it a stag's head from the arms of Mackenzie of Kintail for the Lochalsh area. The gold coronet above the arms was a special pattern reserved for the arms of Scottish district councils, and was topped by thistle-heads.R.M.

He advises adding more classes to simplify complex code. The Booch method is a technique used in software engineering. It is an object modeling language and methodology that was widely used in object- oriented analysis and design. It was developed by Booch while at Rational Software. The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the object-modeling technique (OMT) and object-oriented software engineering (OOSE). Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Design patterns Booch is also an advocate of design patterns. For instance, he wrote the foreword to Design Patterns, an early and highly influential book in the field.

Southwark Towers was formerly the London office of Price Waterhouse before it merged with Coopers & Lybrand in 1998. The property attracted some political interest in the 1970s when the developer, Peachey Property Corporation ('PPC'), got into financial difficulties. It was subsequently alleged that the transaction to develop the property might not have been entered into on an arm's length basis and that there might have been an element of bounty or kindness from PPC to Price Waterhouse, who happened to be PPC's auditors. Department of Trade inspectors dismissed the allegations. In 1998 the building was acquired by Irvine Sellar, a property developer. In 2008, the building was demolished to make way for The Shard. The typical way to demolish a building in the United Kingdom is by implosion, but due to proximity of Guy's Hospital and other buildings, Southwark Towers was instead taken apart in pieces.

The novel wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness.Thomas. (2006). L'engle, Madeleine. In E. M.

The book has inspired two film adaptations, both by Disney: a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay.  Background  Raised in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, author Madeleine L'Engle began writing at a young age. After graduating from boarding school in Switzerland, she attended Smith College, where she earned a degree in English. In addition to writing, L'Engle also gained experience as an actor and playwright. At age forty, she nearly abandoned her career as a novelist, but continued to write after her publication of Meet the Austins. L'Engle wrote A Wrinkle in Time between 1959 and 1960. In her memoir, A Circle of Quiet (1972), L'Engle explains that the book was conceived \\"during a time of transition.\\" After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut where they ran a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country. L'Engle writes that \\"we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, Mrs Whatsit. Mrs Who. Mrs Which.\\" This was in the spring of 1959. When asked for more information in an interview with Horn Book magazine in 1983, L'Engle responded \\"I cannot possibly tell you how I came to write it. It was simply a book I had to write. I had no choice. It was only after it was written that I realized what some of it meant.\\" L'Engle has also described the novel as her \\"psalm of praise to life, [her] stand for life against death.\\" Additionally, L'Engle drew upon her interest in science. The novel includes references to Einstein's theory of relativity and Planck's quantum theory. A Wrinkle in Time is the first novel in the Time Quintet, a series of five young adult novels written by Madeleine L'Engle. Later books include A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, and An Acceptable Time. The series follows the adventures of Meg Murry, her youngest brother Charles Wallace Murry, their friend Calvin O'Keefe, and her twin siblings Sandy and Dennys Murry. Throughout the series, the friends band together to travel through space and time as they attempt to save the world from the grasps of evil. Publication history Upon completion in 1960, the novel was rejected by at least 26 publishers, because it was, in L'Engle's words, \\"too different,\\" and \\"because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children's or an adults' book, anyhow?\\" In \\"A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle\\" on the Random House website, L'Engle offers another possible reason for the rejections: \\"A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book,\\" which at the time was uncommon. After trying \\"forty-odd\\" publishers (L'Engle later said \\"twenty-six rejections\\"), L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her. Then at Christmas, L'Engle threw a tea party for her mother. One of the guests happened to know John C. Farrar of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and he insisted that L'Engle should meet with him. Although the publisher did not, at the time, publish a line of children's books, Farrar met L'Engle, liked the novel, and ultimately published it under the Ariel imprint. In 1963, the book won the Newbery Medal, an annual award given by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American children's literature. The book has been continuously in print since its first publication. The hardback edition is still published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. The original blue dust jacket by Ellen Raskin was replaced with new art by Leo and Diane Dillon, with the publication of A Swiftly Tilting Planet in 1978. The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors' edition (limited to 500 signed and numbered copies), at least two book club editions (one hardback, one Scholastic Book Services paperback), as a trade paperback under the Dell Yearling imprint, and as a mass market paperback under the Dell Laurel-Leaf imprint. The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since its first publication. The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007, along with the rest of the Time Quintet. This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L'Engle as well as a transcription of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech. Plot summary One night, thirteen- year-old Meg Murry meets an eccentric new neighbor, Mrs. Whatsit, who refers to something called a tesseract. She later finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance. The following day, Meg, her child genius brother Charles, and fellow schoolmate Calvin visit Mrs. Whatsit's home, where the equally strange Mrs. Who and the unseen voice of Mrs. Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father. Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon explained as folding the fabric of space and time. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a Utopian world filled with Centaur-like beings who live in a state of light and love. The Mrs. Ws reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing, which is essentially the personification of evil. The children are taken to visit the Happy Medium, a woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, scientists, and artists have been fighting against it. Mrs. Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self- sacrifice to fight the darkness. The children travel to the dark planet of Camazotz, which has succumbed to the Black Thing and where Meg's father is trapped because he would not succumb to the group mind that causes inhabitants to behave in a mechanical way. In order to find their father, Charles Wallace deliberately allows himself to be hypnotized. He takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Meg's father, Alexander, is being held prisoner. Charles Wallace then takes them to It, the evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities that controls the planet. Using special powers from Mrs. Who's glasses, Alexander tessers Calvin, Meg, and himself to the planet Ixchel before IT can control them all. Charles Wallace is left behind, still under the influence of IT and Meg is paralyzed from from injuries sustained during the trip. An inhabitant of the planet with featureless faces, tentacles and four arms proves to be both wise and gentle and cures Meg's paralysis. The trio of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which arrive and charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT. Arriving at the building where IT resides, they find Charles Wallace under IT's influence. Inspired by hints from the Mrs. Ws, Meg focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. They all then tesser back to Earth and the Mrs. Ws leave.

She is considered beautiful by the Murry children and others, having \\"flaming red hair\\", creamy skin, and violet eyes with long dark lashes. Sandy and Dennys Murry Sandy and his twin brother Dennys are the middle children in the Murry family, older than Charles Wallace but younger than Meg. They are 10 years old at the time of this book. The twins are depicted as inseparable from one another. They are the only \\"normal\\" and accepted children in the Murry family. Mrs. Buncombe Mrs. Buncombe is the wife of the constable in Meg's hometown. Mr. Jenkins Mr. Jenkins is Meg's high-school principal who implies that her family is in denial about Mr. Murry's true whereabouts.

She lives in a cavern on a planet in Orion's Belt.  Aunt Beast  Aunt Beast (a name created by Meg) is a character who nurses and befriends Meg on the planet Ixchel. The character is a four-armed eyeless gray creature with telepathic abilities and numerous long, waving tentacles instead of fingers. The character's actual name, if any, is not given.  Analysis   Religious analysis  The novel is highly spiritualized, with notable influences of divine intervention and prominent undertones of religious messages.Humankind - Religion - Spirituality. (1988). In J. B. Simpson, Simpson's contemporary quotations. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/simpsons/humankind_religion_spirituality/0 According to scholar James Beasley Simpson, the overwhelming love and desire for light within the novel is directly representative of a Christian love for God and Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the children encounter spiritual intervention, signaling God's presence in the ordinary, as well as the extendibility of God's power and love. Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer C. S. Lewis. She was herself the official writer-in-residence at New York City's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, which is known for its prominent position in the liberal wing of the Episcopal Church. L'Engle's liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from more conservative Christians, especially with respect to certain elements of A Wrinkle in Time. L'Engle utilizes numerous religious references and allusions in the naming of locations within the novel. The name Camazotz refers to a Mayan bat god, one of L'Engle's many mythological allusions in her nomenclature.; cited in Hettinga, pp. 27, 30. The name Ixchel refers to a Mayan jaguar goddess of medicine. Uriel is a planet with extremely tall mountains, an allusion to the Archangel Uriel. It is inhabited by creatures that resemble winged centaurs. It is \\"the third planet of the Star Malak (meaning 'angel' in Hebrew) in the spiral nebula Messier 101\\", which would place it at roughly 21 million light-years from Earth. The site of Mrs Whatsit's temporary transformation into one of these winged creatures, it is the place where \\"the guardian angels show the questers a vision of the universe that is obscured on earth.\\" Hettinga, p. 26 The three women are described as ancient star-beings who act as guardian angels. The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one. Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the Gospel of John, which is quoted within the book. When the Mrs Ws reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against darkness, they ask the children to name some figures on Earth, a partially dark planet, who fight the darkness. They name Jesus and, later in the discussion, Buddha is named as well. Nevertheless, religious journalist Sarah Pulliam Bailey doubts whether the novel contains religious undertones. Bailey explains that many readers believe the novel promotes witchcraft, as opposed to alluding to Christian spirituality. Bailey states that conservative Christians take offense, due to the novel's potential relativistic qualities, suggesting the various interpretations of religious allusions signals anti-Christian sentiments. However, in her personal journal referencing A Wrinkle in Time, L'Engle confirms the religious content within the novel: \\"If I've ever written a book that says what I feel about God and the universe, this is it.\\"  Conformity  Further, the themes of conformity and the status quo are present. IT is a powerful dominant group that manipulates the planet of Camazotz into conformity. Even Charles Wallace falls prey and is hence persuaded to conform. It is thanks to Meg that she and her family are able to break from conformity. According to the author's granddaughter Charlotte Jones Voiklis, the story was not a simple allegory of communism; in a three-page passage that was cut before publication, the process of domination and conformity is said to be an outcome of dictatorship under totalitarian regimes and by an excessive desire of security under democratic countries. Scholar Jean Fulton writes: > \\"L'Engle's fiction for young readers is considered important partly because > she was among the first to focus directly on the deep, delicate issues that > young people must face, such as death, social conformity, and truth. > L'Engle's work always is uplifting because she is able to look at the > surface values of life from a perspective of wholeness, both joy and pain, > transcending each to uncover the absolute nature of human experience that > they share.\\"  Conformity within Camazotz  Camazotz is a planet of extreme, enforced conformity, ruled by a disembodied brain called IT. Camazotz is similar to Earth, with familiar trees such as birches, pines, and maples, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which \\"might have been one of any number of familiar towns\\". The horror of the place arises from its ordinary appearance, endlessly duplicated. The houses are \\"all exactly alike, small square boxes painted gray\\", which, according to author Donald Hettinga, signals a comparison to \\"the burgeoning American suburbia\\", such as the post-war housing developments of Levittown, Pennsylvania. The people who live in the houses are similarly described as \\"mother figures\\" who \\"all gave the appearance of being the same\\". Scholar William Blackburn draws a comparison to \\"an early sixties American image of life in a Communist state\\", a characterization Blackburn later dismissed.; cited in Hettinga, pp. 27.  Feminism  A Wrinkle in Time has also received praise for empowering young female readers. Critics have celebrated L'Engle's depiction of Meg Murry, a young, precocious heroine whose curiosity and intellect helps save the world from evil. The New York Times has described this portrayal as \\"a departure from the typical 'girls' book' protagonist - as wonderful as many of those varied characters are\\". In doing so, L'Engle has been credited for paving the way for other bright heroines, including Hermione Granger of the Harry Potter book series, as well as Katniss Everdeen of the Hunger Games trilogy. Regarding her choice to include a female protagonist, L'Engle has stated in her acceptance speech upon receiving the Margaret Edwards Award \\"I'm a female. Why would I give all the best ideas to a male?\\" Reception At the time of the book's publication, Kirkus Reviews said: \\"Readers who relish symbolic reference may find this trip through time and space an exhilarating experience; the rest will be forced to ponder the double entendres.\\" According to The Horn Book Magazine: \\"Here is a confusion of science, philosophy, satire, religion, literary allusions, and quotations that will no doubt have many critics. I found it fascinating... It makes unusual demands on the imagination and consequently gives great rewards.\\"The Horn Book Magazine, April 1962, cited in In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote: \\"There is no question but that the book is good entertainment and that the writer carries the story along with a great deal of verve; there is some question about the depth of its quality.\\" A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for sixth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" It was one of the \\"Top 100 Chapter Books\\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal. In 2016, the novel saw a spike in sales after Chelsea Clinton mentioned it as influential in her childhood in a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.  Controversy  A Wrinkle in Time is on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990‚Äì2000 at number 23. The novel has been accused of being both anti-religious and anti-Christian for its inclusion of witches and crystal balls and for containing \\"New Age\\" spiritualist themes that do not reflect traditional Christian teachings. According to USA Today, the novel was challenged in a school district in the state of Alabama due to the \\"book's listing the name of Jesus Christ together with the names of great artists, philosophers, scientists and religious leaders when referring to those who defend Earth against evil.\\" The novel was also challenged in 1984 by an elementary school in Polk City, Florida when parents claimed that the novel promoted witchcraft. Regarding this controversy, author Madeleine L'Engle told The New York Times: \\"It seems people are willing to damn the book without reading it. Nonsense about witchcraft and fantasy. First I felt horror, then anger, and finally I said, ‚ÄòAw, the hell with it.‚Äô It's great publicity, really.\\"  Adaptations   Audio books  In 1994, Listening Library released an unabridged, 4-cassette audio edition read by the author. On January 10, 2012, Audible released a 50th anniversary edition recorded by Hope Davis. From left: David Dorfman as Charles Wallace Murry, Katie Stuart as Meg Murry, and Gregory Smith as Calvin O'Keefe on the planet Uriel  Film adaptations  In 2003, a television adaptation of the novel was made by a collaboration of Canadian production companies, to be distributed in the United States by Disney. The movie was directed by John Kent Harrison, with a teleplay by Susan Shilliday. It stars Katie Stuart as Meg Murry, Alfre Woodard as Mrs. Whatsit, Alison Elliott as Mrs. Who, and Kate Nelligan as Mrs. Which. In an interview with MSNBC/Newsweek, when L'Engle was asked if the film \\"met her expectations\\", she said, \\"I have glimpsed it... I expected it to be bad, and it is.\\" A theatrical feature film adaptation of the novel, by Walt Disney Pictures, was released in 2018. The film was directed by Ava DuVernay and written by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. It stars Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Chris Pine, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid, Michael Pe√±a, and Zach Galifianakis.  Play  An adaptation by James Sie premiered at the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago in 1990, and it returned to the stage in 1998 and 2017. John Glore adapted the novel as a play that premiered in 2010. It was written for six actors playing 12 parts. One actor plays Mrs Whatsit, the Man with Red Eyes, and Camazotz Man. Dr. Kate Murry, Mrs Who, Camazotz Woman, and Aunt Beast also share one performer. The stage adaptation premiered in Costa Mesa, California, with productions in Bethesda, Maryland; Cincinnati; Philadelphia; Orlando; Portland, Oregon; and other cities. An adaptation by Tracy Young premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in April 2014, as well as at colleges and theaters around the U.S. Opera In 1992, OperaDelaware (known for frequently adapting children's books) staged an opera based on A Wrinkle in Time written by Libby Larsen with a libretto by Walter Green. The review in Philly.com stated: \\"The composer does not place arias and set pieces, but conversational ensembles with spoken dialogue that made the young daughter's climactic but concise song about familial love all the more imposing.\\"  Graphic novel  In 2010, Hope Larson announced that she was writing and illustrating the official graphic novel version of the book. This version was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in October 2012.  Further reading  Concerning A Wrinkle in Time * Scholastic BookFiles: A Reading Guide to A Wrinkle in Time * Chase, Carole F.

It is considered a national epic of Spain. The work survives in a medieval manuscript which is now in the Spanish National Library.Dos Espanoles en la historia: el Cid y Ramon Menendez Pidal. Exhibition at the BNE 2019.  Origin  The Spanish medievalist Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal included the Cantar de mio Cid in the popular tradition he termed the mester de juglar√≠a. Mester de juglar√≠a refers to the medieval tradition according to which popular poems were passed down from generation to generation, being changed in the process. These poems were meant to be performed in public by minstrels (or juglares), who each performed the traditional composition differently according to the performance context‚Äîsometimes adding their own twists to the epic poems they told, or abbreviating it according to the situation. El Cantar de mio Cid shows signs of being designed for oral transmission. For example, the poem ends with a request for wine for the person who has recited it (Es leido, dadnos del vino). On the other hand, some critics (known as individualists) believe El Cantar de mio Cid was composed by one Per Abbad (in English, Abbot Peter) who appears to be credited as the writer of the work in a colophon to the text. It has been suggested that the poem, which is written in Old Spanish, is an example of the learned poetry that was cultivated in the monasteries and other centers of erudition. However, Per Abbad puts the date 1207 after his name and current thinking is that his claim to have written the work has simply been copied along with the text of an earlier manuscript now lost. The existing copy forms part of a 14th-century codex in the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a (National Library) in Madrid, Spain. It is, however, incomplete, missing the first page and two others in the middle. For the purposes of preservation, it is not normally on display. There are sources that claim that the song was written several years earlier, considering the historical Cid died in 1099. These, however, recognize that the poem itself would not have been written immediately after the death of its titular hero since the narrative would not have been picked up if the story of the Cid did not yet attain its legendary status. There are those who also take into consideration the emergence of the Carolingian legends, which began after 1100 since it is believed that these stories also influenced the poem. The Poem of the Cid, for example, echoes the plot devices used in The Song of Roland epic. Title One of the oldest document preserved at the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid only stated this phrase Hic incipiunt gesta Roderici Campi Docti as the poem's title, which means \\"Here begins the deeds of Rodrigo the Campeador.\\" Its current title is a 19th-century proposal by Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal since its original title is unknown. Some merely call the poem El Poema del Cid on the grounds that it is not a cantar but a poem made up of three cantares. The title has been translated into English as The Lay of the Cid and The Song of the Cid. Mio Cid is literally \\"My Cid\\", a term of endearment used by the narrator and by characters in the work. The word Cid originates from Arabic sidi or sayyid (ÿ≥ŸäÿØ), an honorific title similar to English Sir (in the medieval, courtly sense). The commonly used title El Cantar de mio Cid means literally The Song of my Lord or The Poem of my Lord. As the original title of the poem is lost to history, this one was suggested by historian Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal. It is Old Spanish (old Castilian), adjusted to modern orthography. In modern Spanish the title might be rendered El Poema de mi Se√±or or El Poema de mi Jefe. The expression cantar (literally \\"to sing\\") was used to mean a chant or a song. The word Cid (√áid in old Spanish orthography), was a derivation of the dialectal Arabic word ÿ≥ŸäÿØ s√Ædi or sayyid, which means lord or master. During the period the poem was written, Arabic was still a widely used and highly regarded language in Iberia (hence the fact that modern Spanish still contains many Arabic words). √áid was not a common word, though, in old Spanish and thus can be treated almost as a proper noun. The story El Cid married the cousin of King Alfonso VI, Do√±a Ximena, but for certain reasons (according to the story, he made the king swear by Santa Gadea that he had not ordered the fratricide of his own brother), he fell into the disfavor of the king and had to leave his home country of Castile. Ignacio Pinazo (1879). The story begins with the exile of El Cid, whose enemies had unjustly accused him of stealing money from the king, Alfonso VI of Castile and Le√≥n, leading to his exile. To regain his honor, he participated in the battles against the Moorish armies and conquered Valencia. By these heroic acts he regained the confidence of the king and his honor was restored. The king personally marries El Cid's daughters to the infantes (princes) of Carri√≥n. However, when the princes are humiliated by El Cid's men for their cowardice, the infantes swear revenge. They beat their new wives and leave them for dead. When El Cid learns of this he pleads to the king for justice. The infantes are forced to return El Cid's dowry and are defeated in a duel, stripping them of all honor. El Cid's two daughters then remarry to the principes (crown princes) of Navarre and Aragon. Through the marriages of his daughters, El Cid began the unification of Spain. Unlike other European medieval epics, the tone is realist.El Cid del Cantar: El h√©roe literario y el h√©roe √©pico, Rafael Beltr√°n There is no magic, even the apparition of archangel Gabriel (verses 404‚Äì410) happens in a dream. However, it also departs from historic truth: for example, there is no mention of his son, his daughters were not named Elvira and Sol and they did not become queens. It consists of more than 3,700 verses of usually 14 through 16 syllables, each with a caesura between the hemistiches. The rhyme is assonant. Since 1913, and following the work of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, the entire work is conventionally divided into three parts: Cantar del Destierro (verses 1‚Äì1086) El Cid is exiled from Castile by King Alfonso VI and fights against the Moors to regain his honor. Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar is called M√≠o Cid (meaning My Lord) by the Moors. His current task is to collect the tributes from the Moorish territory owed to his king, Alfonso VI of Le√≥n. Cid's enemy accuses him of taking some of these tributes and the king exiles him from Le√≥n and Castile. Before he leaves, he places his wife, Do√±a Ximena, and his two daughters, Do√±a Elvira and Do√±a Sol, in the Monastery of Carde√±a. The canto then gives accounts of raids in the Moorish territory in which Cid and his men get rich off of the spoils. Cantar de las bodas de las hijas del Cid (verses 1087‚Äì2277) El Cid defends the city of Valencia, defeating King Chufa ibn Tashfin of the Almoravids. El Cid restores his honor and grants his daughters permission to marry the infantes of Carri√≥n. It begins with Cid's capture of the city of Valencia. He brings his family to live with him. It is discovered that the Infantes (princes) de Carri√≥n, the nephews to the king, are the enemies who caused Cid's exile. They plot to marry his daughters to take some of his wealth. The king acts on behalf of his nephews and pardons Cid and allows the marriages. Cid suspects that something bad will happen from the marriages but he allows it anyway. Cantar de la Afrenta de Corpes (verses 2278‚Äì3730) The infantes of Carri√≥n were put to shame after being scared of a lion roaming in the court and running away from a campaign to fight against the Moors. So, in revenge, they decide to abuse and abandon their wives at the roadside in Corpes, tied to trees. Once more, El Cid has to gain his honor back, so he asks the court of Toledo for justice. The infantes are defeated in a duel by El Cid's men, and his daughters remarry to the infantes of Navarre and Aragon. The Cantar shows that the Infantes are cowards in battles with the Moors. They are made fun of and decide to get revenge by attacking their wives. They set out for Carri√≥n with their wives and an escort, Felix Mu√±oz, the cousin of the daughters. Once on the journey, they send the escort ahead of them, steal their wives' great dowries (including two beautiful swords) and beat them and leave them for dead. Mu√±oz suspects trouble and returns to his cousins and takes them to receive help. Cid seeks to right the wrongs done to his daughters, and a trial is held. A duel is held between some of Cid's men and the Infantes in which the Infantes lose. In the middle of the trial, a message is sent from the kings of Navarra and Aragon, proposing to marry their sons to Cid's daughters. These marriages take place after the defeat of the Infantes and near the end of the story. Authorship and composition date The linguistic analysis allows the reconstruction of a 12th-century previous text, which Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal dated circa 1140. Date and authorship are still open to debate.Francisco A. Marcos-Mar√≠n, Cantar de Mio Cid. Edici√≥n. (Introducci√≥n, Edici√≥n Cr√≠tica, Versi√≥n en Espa√±ol Moderno y Notas).

Doc Daneeka is a fictional character in the 1961 novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. Doc Daneeka is the squadron physician and a friend of the novel's protagonist, Yossarian. \\"Catch-22\\" itself is first explained in the novel when Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka to excuse him from combat duty. Doc Daneeka is also the title of Chapter 4 of the novel. Character sketch Motivations Doc Daneeka's main motivation throughout is for his own welfare, if that be making money or protecting his own life. He generally forgets his moral duty as a physician except in the most extreme of circumstances. Goals Doc Daneeka's goal before he is drafted into the war is to make a successful business out of his medical practice based in New York, he has stated that \\"my most valuable medical tool is my cash register\\". He lies to the drafting board about his health in an attempt to avoid the war and become well-off, as the competition is drafted instead. Once he is drafted his main goal is to get through the war alive. He is a hypochondriac who never gets ill, and is looking to avoid anything that would increase the risk to his life. He sees unnecessary risks to include displeasing his superiors for grounding crew and being shipped off to the Pacific Ocean, water and its ability to drown a man, and having to fly in a claustrophobic aircraft, which he likens to \\"climbing back into the womb\\". Relationships and conflicts Doc Daneeka is regularly explaining to his good friend Yossarian why he cannot ground him, even though Yossarian helps him collect his flight pay without having to fly. His fears and the constraints of military bureaucracy prevent him from helping his friend. He shows unusual compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden. Doc Daneeka feels the military is responsible for his being drafted into the war effort and put in harm's way, because they were distrustful of him when he lied on his drafting papers about his health. He is constantly scared of upsetting his superiors who may see fit to then ship him off to the far more dangerous South Pacific. Already he sees it as military cruelty to have been assigned to the Air Corps even though he is scared of flying. Doc Daneeka, as squadron physician, is meant to supervise Gus and Wes who run the medical tent. He generally shows little care for the way they run the tent, basically leaving the growing bureaucracy to decide who is ill enough to be sent to hospital, without reference to medical expertise. This climaxes when Gus and Wes pronounce Doc Daneeka dead at the medical tent against the obvious fact that he is standing alive in front of them. Doc Daneeka finally falls foul of the bureaucratic processes that are central to Catch-22: when McWatt flies his plane into the mountain after he accidentally kills Kid Sampson, Doc Daneeka's name is on McWatt's crew manifest. Doc Daneeka was not on board the plane, but had an arrangement with McWatt to falsely record his name on the manifest so he could collect flight pay. Doc Daneeka attempts in vain to convince the bureaucracy that he is alive, but the process has already started. He tries to convince his wife that he is not dead, but fails. His wife gives up on him as his death leads to her financial benefit. Doc Daneeka is forced to share a tent with Chief White Halfoat, whom he is scared of. He is also concerned that he will catch pneumonia from Chief White Halfoat, who is obsessed that he will soon die of pneumonia. Epiphanies During Milo's bombing of the airbase and the death of Snowden, Doc Daneeka shows the compassion for others he lacks throughout the rest of the novel. During the bombing, Doc Daneeka risks his life by attending to the wounded in the field while bombs are still falling, and after Snowden's death, he cleans up Yossarian and treats him for shock. At the end, Doc Daneeka's bureaucratic death convinces him that maybe he is, in fact, dead. Biographical summary Actions in \\"Catch-22\\" At home Doc Daneeka was a physician in his hometown of Staten Island, where he initially established a failing practice. As the war effort drafts in more medical personnel, Doc Daneeka's surgery booms, especially with increased kickbacks from the local pharmacies and abortion referrals from the beauty parlors. This lucrative business comes to an end when the military catch up with him after he lies to the draft board about having one leg amputated and being bed-ridden with incurable rheumatoid arthritis. Doc describes only one experience of his practice at home: a young newlywed couple who are unable to procreate. Doc finds out the girl is still a virgin and is cheeky when he asks about the medal of Saint Anthony that lies between her bosom, and the terrible temptation that this must be for Saint Anthony. When he asks the husband how often they have sex, he boasts \\"Every night\\". Doc concludes they have no idea, and with the aid of two rubber models gives a demonstration of intercourse. They thank him for his help and go away to give it a try. Later, the husband returns and, punching him in the nose, cries, \\"What are you, some kind of wise guy?\\" In Pianosa Doc Daneeka appears as a petulant man, feeling beaten by the military for losing his advantage of being one of few doctors around back home. As a military doctor, Doc Daneeka has the ability to choose who of the pilots can be grounded from needing to fly more missions, and who must continue. Because of Colonel Cathcart's competing attitude of increasing the missions every time the men meet the requirement, pilots with successful fruition grovel for Doc Daneeka to allow them grounding. Since Doc Daneeka is miserably sour for losing out on his business advantage, he takes it out on the men by not grounding any. Doc Daneeka is a hypochondriac, who feels something must be physically wrong with himself. He also vainly attempts to remove himself from the military effort; he regularly approaches Gus and Wes, his two nurses, to perform routine physical and check his temperature, which invariably remains a constant, sub-average 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit. =Gus and Wes= Gus and Wes assist Doc Daneeka and take the responsibility for dealing with the majority of people who visit the medical tent where they have \\"succeeded in elevating medicine to an exact science\\". Gus and Wes is actually a single character. Their utilitarian method of dealing with any person presenting themselves at the medical tent is to take their temperature. Those with temperatures above 102¬∞ Fahrenheit are sent to the hospital; those below 102¬∞ have their gums and toes painted purple with gentian violet solution and are given a laxative that is quickly disposed of in the bushes. Those with temperatures of exactly 102¬∞ are asked to return in an hour to have their temperatures taken again. The only exception to this is Yossarian, who normally runs a temperature of 101¬∞, but who can go to the hospital whenever he wants because he is not afraid of them. Gus and Wes appear to represent organizational functionaries that anyone who has had the misfortune of dealing with an impersonal bureaucracy should recognize. Why me? Doc Daneeka shows he has a total lack of empathy for anyone else and he can only think about his own unfortunate circumstances, characterised with his constant lament \\"Why me?\\" From bemoaning his loss of a lucrative medical business because he had lied on his drafting papers, to his complete lack of interest for those under his care that may result him being punished by is superiors if he did care. Even when Yossarian helps Doc Daneeka by allowing him to get his flight pay without actually doing the required number of flights (because he is scared of flying) he will not help: > \\"You do a favor for me, I'll do one for you. Get it?\\" > \\"Do one for me,\\" Yossarian requested. > \\"Not a chance,\\" Doc Daneeka responded. This is in total contrast to what might be expected of doctors following the Hippocratic Oath. The Doc does redeem himself, when during Milo's bombing of the airbase, the Doc \\"loses his head\\" and works continuously in the field helping the wounded. Also he shows compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden over Avignon, by covering him in a blanket and cleaning up Snowden‚Äôs blood from Yossarian‚Äôs clothes. =Dr Stubbs= Dr Stubbs is the doctor in Dunbar's squadron. Dr. Stubbs decides to try to confront the rules of Catch-22 by grounding any soldier who asks. Catch-22 cannot be beaten though, as the grounding orders are short-lived as they are rescinded by higher authorities and the soldiers are put back on duty. As punishment Dr Stubbs is transferred to the Pacific, which is one of Doc Daneeka's greatest fears. Catch-22 Yossarian is Doc Daneeka's only friend on the base. Yossarian, like the other flying officers, continually begs for grounding, although he never successfully accomplishes the number of missions required. Nonetheless, he continues to ask. One day, while Yossarian explains his pitiful circumstances, Doc Daneeka becomes the first in the novel to detail the structured frameworking of what is formally known as \\"Catch-22\\"; a circular argument that prevents any of the men from removing themselves from combat: > There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a > concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate > was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All > he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and > would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and > sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he > was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had > to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this > clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. > \\"That's some catch, that Catch-22,\\" he [Yossarian] observed. > \\"It's the best there is,\\" Doc Daneeka agreed. \\"Death\\" One of his requisites of being an Air Corps doctor includes logging four hours per month of flight time in order to earn his flight pay. Since Doc Daneeka experiences fears of flight, he gets Yossarian to convince McWatt to add his name to his flight roster so that his hours are recorded, yet he does not need to leave the ground. While McWatt performs a training flight, he flies too low, killing Kid Sampson on the raft. Because of his grief, McWatt immediately flies into a mountain and commits suicide. Since McWatt's flight roster included Doc Daneeka's name, the military blindly assumes and pronounces that Doc Daneeka also died on the flight. The irony, that Doc Daneeka was standing next to the Sergeant Knight who affirmed this tragedy, is further enforced when Doc Daneeka continues to argue that he did not die. =Mrs Daneeka= Corporal Whitcomb develops the idea of writing and sending home form letters of condolence from Colonel Cathcart to those who died or went missing in combat. To cover all circumstances, the letter reads as a vague letter that could imply any type of death of any form of relative. At home, Mrs Daneeka receives one of these form letters that her husband has died in combat. She later receives a check from his GI insurance for $250 to finance his funeral. She then continues to receive donations and other insurances that Doc Daneeka paid for. As the proceedings continue to accumulate, she later appears to be pleased that her husband is dead. Doc Daneeka, enraged with the thickheadedness of the military, writes home two letters to his wife, Mrs Daneeka, addressed by himself. His wife feels uncertain after acquiring the first and asks if it is possible the military made a mistake, but is assured that the letter is simply the work of a \\"sadistic and psychotic forger\\". Doc Daneeka futilely composes his second letter which she now believes to be a hoax. The book makes note that she and her children move to a new place; she leaves no forwarding address, and no further reference of her existence throughout the rest of the story. Doc Daneeka's last appearance in the story is in his tent with Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat, who is about to go up to the hospital to die of pneumonia. His last speech implies that he has accepted that he is bureaucratically a dead man: > :‚ÄòHe‚Äôs dead,‚Äô Chief White Halfoat gloated, with a horse laugh entangled in > phlegm. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs really funny.‚Äô :‚ÄòI don‚Äôt even draw my pay any more.‚Äô > :‚ÄòThat‚Äôs really funny,‚Äô Chief White Halfoat repeated. ‚ÄòAll this time he‚Äôs > been insulting my liver, and look what happened to him. He‚Äôs dead. Killed by > his own greed.‚Äô :That‚Äôs not what killed me,‚Äô Doc Daneeka observed in a voice > that was calm and flat. ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with greed. It‚Äôs all that > lousy Dr. Stubbs‚Äô fault, getting Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn stirred > up against flight surgeons. He‚Äôs going to give the medical profession a bad > name by standing up for principle. If he‚Äôs not careful, he‚Äôll be black- > balled by his state medical association and kept out of the hospitals.‚Äô Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat ignore him, acting as if he is not there. Doc Daneeka disappears from the story at this point. Major themes *Bureaucracy Doc Daneeka's bureaucratic death parallels one of the main themes of the book that the bureaucratic system holds an impersonal attitude toward those who do not hold power in the higher echelons of the military branch (colonels and generals). There is major irony in his death. The government goes so far to shield the military through political correctness on paper trails as to ignore the blatant, visual proof that Doc Daneeka did not die. *Medical Ethics *Catch-22 *Greed Film portraits Doc Daneeka was portrayed by Jack Gilford in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel directed by Mike Nichols. Grant Heslov played the character in the 2019 miniseries. The miniseries diminishes his role. While he still is the one who informs Yossarian about Catch-22, he is not mistaken for being dead and actually does try to help him out in getting sent home, though this fails.

It was published by Tor Books and released on October 15, 1994, and was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1995. Lord of Chaos consists of a prologue, 55 chapters, and an epilogue. It is the first book of the Wheel of Time to have an epilogue. Plot summary With many of the seals on his prison broken, the Dark One has grown in power. He causes global warming, revives the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel as Osan'gar and Aran'gar, and creates Shaidar Haran, his Myrddraal incarnation. In response to Rand al'Thor's amnesty on male channelers, Mazrim Taim swears allegiance to him. Together they form the Black Tower, which trains male channelers called Asha'man. Rand is diplomatically courted by both the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar, who send an envoy to Caemlyn, and the Aes Sedai of the White Tower, who send an envoy (many of which are in fact Black Ajah) to Cairhien. In an unsuccessful attempt to control Rand, Alanna Mosvani of the rebel Aes Sedai bonds Rand as her Warder against his will. Additionally, Min Farshaw, who had traveled with the Salidar Aes Sedai, reunites with Rand and gives him much-needed emotional support. Rand later discovers Salidar's location and sends Mat Cauthon there, to retrieve Elayne Trakand who will rule Caemlyn and Cairhien in his stead. Perrin Aybara leaves the Two Rivers to join Rand in Caemlyn. The deposed Queen of Andor, Morgase Trakand, goes to Amadicia for aid in returning to the throne but is instead taken captive by the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, Pedron Niall. In Salidar, Elayne and Nynaeve al'Meara have made numerous magical discoveries thanks to Moghedien, who they secretly hold in captivity. Most significantly, Nynaeve Heals Siuan Sanche, Leane Sharif, and Logain Ablar, restoring their abilities to channel. Egwene al'Vere is named the Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai and travels to Salidar through Tel'aran'rhiod. Upon arrival, she unofficially raises Nynaeve and Elayne to Aes Sedai and sends them and Aviendha to Ebou Dar to search for a ter'angreal called the \\"Bowl of the Winds\\" to break the Dark One's control of the climate. Mat arrives at this time and reluctantly goes with them. After their departure, Egwene secretly arranges the escape of Logain, who then goes to the Black Tower. Aran'gar infiltrates Salidar and later frees Moghedien. Shortly after Perrin joins him, Rand is kidnapped by Elaida's Aes Sedai, who torture him en route to Tar Valon. Learning of the kidnapping, Perrin leads Rand's followers to the climactic Battle of Dumai's Wells. At the end of the battle, the rebel Aes Sedai are forced to swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn while the surviving White Tower Aes Sedai remain captives. Battle of Dumai's Wells The Battle of Dumai's Wells occurs in Chapter 55 of this book.

The Shaido have betrayed the Aes Sedai and have surrounded a group of wagons on which the Aes Sedai are situated, and are trying unsuccessfully to overwhelm its defenders to kidnap Rand al'Thor for themselves when the Pro Rand forces arrive. The Two Rivers men, Cairhienin, Aiel and Winged Guards are to charge down into the valley after an attack of wolves, with Perrin at their head. The Salidar Aes Sedai and Wise Ones are to stay up on the ridge. However, when fighting, Perrin sees some Salidar Aes Sedai fighting. The Pro-Rand forces fight their way in, but against far superior numbers they're only able to penetrate so far before they can go no further. In the thick of battle, about 200 Asha'man led by Mazrim Taim Travel to Dumai's Wells, emerge from their gateways and immediately kill any Shaido they see. They are instrumental in turning the tide of the battle. When three of the Tower Aes Sedai shielding Rand leave to join the battle (leaving only 3 instead of the usual, and needed, 6 Aes Sedai guarding him to maintain his shield), Rand manages to break through the shield thanks to Lews Therin Telamon's help, reaching saidin and breaking out of the chest in which he was trapped. He stills all three of the Aes Sedai shielding him in the rush to break free. Rand finds Min beneath pieces of the exploded chest, but she is unharmed. He cuts her bonds and leads her out into the battle. Rand then continues knocking unconscious and shielding more Tower Aes Sedai from within their lines, weakening their defence against the Shaido and their Wise Ones. As he is using saidin they are unable to detect him. Gawyn Trakand rides up, and wants to take Min away, but she refuses. She tells Gawyn that his sister Elayne Trakand loves Rand; Gawyn, believing rumors that say Rand killed his mother, swears that he will see Rand die one day before wheeling away and retreating with his Younglings. The 200 Asha'man create a dome of Air around the wagons, to keep the remaining Shaido Aiel out. Some Asha'man are holding 23 Tower Aes Sedai hostage. Some of Rand's allies are inside the dome; Perrin and Loial are two such. The rest of his allies (e.g. several Wise Ones, Rhuarc) are outside of the dome, still fighting. The shield cannot be raised to admit his allies without letting the Shaido in. So Rand orders the Asha'man to \\"send a message\\" to Sevanna. He hopes that his allies who are outside of the dome will see what is happening, and get away before they get hurt. Mazrim Taim, the M'hael, orders the Asha'man to raise the dome by two spans. The Shaido Aiel who are now within the dome are then killed as they literally explode when the Asha'mans' weaves touch them. A \\"Rolling Ring of Earth and Fire\\" causes the ground around the dome to split and fire to pour out from its cracks. The Shaido, now terrified, break and run, thousands dead left behind in their wake. After the battle, the nine Salidar Aes Sedai come over to congratulate Rand. However, Rand is angered that the Salidar Aes Sedai disobeyed his orders in bringing more than the allotted number of sisters, offers them the choice of being treated like the Tower Aes Sedai, kept prisoner by the Asha'man or swearing an oath of fealty to him. After Mazrim Taim adds, \\"Kneel and swear to the Lord Dragon, or you will be knelt,\\" the Salidar Aes Sedai kneel and swear.

Naming systems Eponyms are a longstanding tradition in Western science and medicine. Being awarded an eponym is regarded as an honor: \\"Eponymity, not anonymity, is the standard.\\"Merton R K, 1973 The scientific and medical communities regard it as bad form to attempt to eponymise oneself. Ideally, to discuss something, it should have a name. When medicine lacked diagnostic tools to investigate and definitively pinpoint the underlying causes of many diseases, assigning an eponym afforded physicians a concise label for a symptom cluster versus cataloguing the multiple systemic features that characterized the patient. Some diseases are named for the person, most often a physician, but occasionally another health care professional, who first described the condition ‚Äî typically by publishing an article in a respected medical journal. Less frequently, an eponymous disease is named after a patient, examples being Lou Gehrig's disease, Hartnup disease, and Mortimer's disease. In one instance, Machado‚ÄìJoseph disease, the eponym is derived from the surnames of two families in which the condition was initially described. Instances also exist of eponyms named for fictional persons who displayed characteristics attributed to the syndrome; these include Miss Havisham syndrome, named for a Dickens character, and Plyushkin syndrome, named for a Gogol character (the two also happen to be alternative names for the same symptom complex). At least two eponymous disorders follow none of the foregoing conventions: Fregoli delusion draws its name from an actor whose character shifts mimicked the type of delusion it now describes; Munchausen syndrome derives from a literary allusion to Baron von Munchausen, whose personal habits were suggestive of the symptom cluster associated with it. Disease naming structures which reference place names, such as (Bornholm disease, Lyme disease, Ebola virus disease) are properly termed toponymic, although an NLM/NIH online publication described them as eponymichttps://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/naming. Similarly, diseases named for societies, as in the case of Legionnaires' disease, are not eponyms, nor are those named for their association with a particular occupation or trade, examples including nun's knee, tennis elbow, and mad hatter's disease. In May 2015, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), released a statement on the Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases \\"with the aim to minimize unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.\\" These guidelines emerged in response to backlash against people and places, based on the vernacular names of infectious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. These naming conventions are not intended to replace the International Classification of Diseases, but rather, are guidelines for scientists, national authorities, the national and international media and other stakeholders who may be the first to discuss the diseases publicly. Punctuation In 1975, the Canadian National Institutes of Health held a conference that discussed the naming of diseases and conditions. This was reported in The Lancet where the conclusion was summarized as: \\"The possessive use of an eponym should be discontinued, since the author neither had nor owned the disorder.\\" Medical journals, dictionaries and style guides remain divided on this issue. European journals tend towards continued use of the possessive, while US journals are largely discontinuing its use. The trend in possessive usage varies between countries, journals, and diseases. The problem is, in fact, that the possessive (case) was given its misleading name for historical reasons and that now even educated people, if they are not linguists, often make incorrect assumptions and decisions based on this misleading name. Nevertheless, no native speakers would accept the ungrammatical \\"men department\\" as a possible way of saying \\"men's department\\" nor claim that this \\"possessive\\" and obligatory apostrophe in any way imply that men possess the department. This case was called the genitive until the 18th century and (like the genitive case in other languages) in fact expresses much more than possession. For example, in the expressions \\"the school's headmaster\\", \\"the men's department\\", and \\"tomorrow's weather\\", the school does not own/possess the headmaster, men don't own/possess the department, and tomorrow does not/will not own the weather. Most disagreements about the use of possessive forms of nouns and of the apostrophe are due to the erroneous opinion that a term should not use an apostrophe if it does not express possession. In the words of Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage: This dictionary also cites a study (not checked by editor) that found that only 40% of the possessive forms were used to indicate actual possession.  Autoeponym  Associating an individual's name with a disease merely based on describing it confers only an eponymic; the individual must have been either affected by the disease or have died from it for the name to be termed autoeponymic. Thus, an 'autoeponym' is a medical condition named in honor of an individual who was affected by or died as a result of the disease which he had described or identified or, in the case of a non-physician patient, from which the patient suffered. Autoeponyms may use either the possessive or non- possessive form, with the preference to use the non-possessive form for a disease named for a physician who first described it and the possessive form in cases of a disease named for a patient (commonly, but not always, the first patient) who had the particular disease. Autoeponyms listed in this entry conform to those conventions with regard to the possessive and non-possessive forms. Examples of autoeponyms include: * Rickettsiosis: in 1906, Howard Taylor Ricketts discovered that the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is carried by a tick. He injected himself with the pathogen. Ricketts died in 1909 while investigating typhus (Rickettsia prowazakii) in Mexico City. * Thomsen's disease: an autosomal dominant myotonia of voluntary muscles described by Julius Thomsen about himself and his family members. * Carrion disease: Peruvian medical student Daniel Alcides Carri√≥n inoculated himself with Bartonella bacilliformis in 1885 to prove the link to this disease, characterized by \\"Oroya fever.\\" He is now regarded as a national hero. * Lou Gehrig's disease: although Gehrig, a New York Yankees player of the early twentieth century, was not the first patient described as having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the association of such a prominent individual with the then little-known disease resulted in his name becoming eponymous with it. Eponyms and trends The current trend is away from the use of eponymous disease names and towards a medical name that describes either the cause or primary signs. Reasons for this include: * The name confers history; * A national or ethnic bias attaches to the eponym chosen; * Credit should have gone to a different person; * An eponym may be applied to different diseases, which creates confusion; * Several eponyms refer to one disease (e.g., amyloid degeneration is variously called Abercrombie disease, Abercrombie syndrome, and Virchow syndrome); * An eponym proves invalid (e.g., Laurence‚ÄìMoon‚ÄìBardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome, in which findings in the patients of Laurence and Moon were later found to differ from those of Bardet and Biedl). * An eponym honors an individual who has been otherwise discredited (e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis is named for Friedrich Wegener, a Nazi physician). It was renamed to granulomatosis with polyangiitis when Dr. Wegener's Nazi ties were discovered. * Its referent varies by country (e.g., sideropenic dysphagia is Plummer‚ÄìVinson syndrome in the US and Australia, Patterson‚ÄìKelly syndrome in the UK, and Waldenstrom‚ÄìKjellberg syndrome in Scandinavia). Arguments for maintaining eponyms include: * The eponym may be shorter and more memorable than the medical name (the latter requiring abbreviation to its acronym); * The medical name proves to be incorrect; * The syndrome may have more than one cause, yet it remains useful to consider it as a whole. * It continues to respect a person who may otherwise be forgotten. The usage of the genitive apostrophe in disease eponyms has followed different trends. While it remains common for some diseases, it has dwindled for others. Alphabetical list Explanation of listing sequence As described above, multiple eponyms can exist for the same disease. In these instances, each is listed individually (except as described below), followed by an in-line parenthetical entry beginning 'aka' ('also known as') that lists all alternative eponyms. This facilitates use of the list for a reader who knows a particular disease only by one of its eponyms, without the necessity of cross-linking entries. It sometimes happens that an alternative eponym, if listed separately, would immediately alphabetically precede or succeed another entry for the same disease. There are three conventions that have been applied to these instances: :1. No separate entry appears for the alternative eponym. It is listed only in the parenthetical 'aka' entry (e.g., Aarskog syndrome appears only as a parenthetical entry to Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome). :2. If eponymous names subsequent to the first are sequenced differently or the eponym is differentiated by another term (e.g., disease versus syndrome), alphabetical sequence dictates which is the linked version versus which is listed as the alternative (e.g., Abderhalden‚ÄìKaufmann‚ÄìLignac is the linked entry and Abderhalden‚ÄìLignac‚ÄìKaufmann is the parenthetical alternative entry). :3. If the number of names included in two or more eponyms varies, the linked entry is the one which includes the most individual surnames (e.g., Alpers‚ÄìHuttenlocher syndrome is the linked entry for the disease also known as Alpers disease or Alpers syndrome).

It provides a vertical link between two navigable waterways: the River Weaver and the Trent and Mersey Canal. The structure is designated as a scheduled monument, and is included in the National Heritage List for England. Built in 1875, the boat lift was in use for over 100 years until it was closed in 1983 due to corrosion. Restoration started in 2001 and the boat lift was re-opened in 2002. The lift and associated visitor centre and exhibition are operated by the Canal & River Trust. It is one of only two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom; the other is the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland. Economic background Aerial view of Anderton Boat Lift and basin on the north bank of the River Weaver Salt has been extracted from rock salt beds underneath the Cheshire Plain since Roman times. By the end of the 17th century a major salt mining industry had developed around the Cheshire \\"salt towns\\" of Northwich, Middlewich, Nantwich and Winsford. Completion of the River Weaver Navigation in 1734 provided a navigable route for transporting salt from Winsford, through Northwich, to Frodsham, where the Weaver joins the River Mersey. In 1759 the second Weaver Navigation Act appointed the Trustees of the Weaver Navigation and gave them responsibility for maintaining and operating the route. The opening of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777 provided a second route close to the Weaver Navigation for part of its length, but extended further south to the coal mining and pottery industries around Stoke-on-Trent. . Rather than competing with each other the owners of the two waterways decided it would be more profitable to work together. In 1793 a basin was excavated on the north bank of the Weaver at Anderton that took the river to the foot of the escarpment of the canal - above. The Anderton Basin was owned and operated by the Weaver Navigation Trustees. Facilities were built to trans-ship goods between the waterways including two cranes, two salt chutes and an inclined plane that was possibly inspired by the much larger Hay Inclined Plane at Coalport. The facilities were extended when a second quay was built in 1801 and a second entrance to the basin was constructed in 1831. Planning and design By 1870 the Anderton Basin was a major interchange for trans-shipping goods in both directions, with extensive warehousing, three double inclined planes and four salt chutes. Trans-shipment was time-consuming and expensive, and the Trustees of the Weaver Navigation decided a link between the waterways was needed to allow boats to pass directly from one to the other. A flight of locks was considered but discarded, mainly because of the lack of a suitable site and the loss of water that would have resulted from using them. In 1870 the Trustees proposed a boat lift between the waterways at the Anderton Basin. The Trustees approached the North Staffordshire Railway Company, owners of the Trent and Mersey Canal, to ask for a contribution towards the cost. When this approach was unsuccessful the Trustees decided to fund the project themselves. Anderton Boat Lift ‚Äì diagram of original hydraulic configuration (not to scale). The Trustees asked their Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, to draw up plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design involving a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support the weight of the loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark. Having decided on a hydraulic ram design Leader Williams appointed Edwin Clark as principal designer. At that time the Anderton Basin consisted of a cut on the north bank of the Weaver surrounding a small central island. Clark decided to build the boat lift on this island. The wrought iron caissons were long by wide by deep, and could each accommodate two narrowboats or a barge with a beam of up to . Each caisson weighed when empty and when full of water (because of displacement, the weight is the same with or without boats). Each caisson was supported by a single hydraulic ram consisting of a hollow long cast iron vertical piston with a diameter of , in a buried long cast iron vertical cylinder with a diameter of . At river level the caissons sat in a water-filled sandstone lined chamber. Above ground the superstructure consisted of seven hollow cast iron columns which provided guide rails for the caissons and supported an upper working platform, walkways and access staircase. At the upper level the boat lift was connected to the Trent and Mersey canal via a long wrought iron aqueduct, with vertical wrought iron gates at either end. In normal operation the cylinders of the hydraulic rams were connected by a diameter pipe that allowed water to pass between them, thus lowering the heavier caisson and raising the lighter one. To make adjustments at the start and end of a lift either cylinder could be operated independently, powered by an accumulator or pressure vessel at the top of the lift structure, which was kept primed by a steam engine. If necessary, the steam engine and accumulator could operate either hydraulic ram independently to raise the caissons, although in this mode it took about 30 minutes to raise a caisson, as opposed to three minutes in normal operation. Construction In October 1871 the Weaver Navigation Trustees held a special general meeting which resolved \\"to consider the desirability of constructing a lift with basins and all other requisite works for the interchange of traffic between the River Weaver and the North Staffordshire Canal at Anderton and of applying to Parliament for an Act to authorise the construction of such works.\\" In July 1872 Royal Assent was granted for the Weaver Navigation 1872 Act, which authorised the construction of the boat lift. The contract for its construction was awarded to Emmerson, Murgatroyd & Co. of Stockport and Liverpool. Work started before the end of 1872 and took 30 months. The Anderton Boat Lift was formally opened to traffic on 26 July 1875. The total cost was ¬£48,428 (¬£ at today's prices). Problems of hydraulic operation For five years the boat lift operated successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron hydraulic cylinder burst while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the rate of descent and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt and there was no damage to the lift's superstructure. As a precaution tests were carried out on the second hydraulic cylinder. During these tests the second cylinder failed too. As a result the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned. The volume of traffic through the lift grew steadily through the 1880s and 90s but the hydraulic cylinders continued to cause problems. The gland of one cylinder (where the piston travelled through the cylinder wall) was temporarily repaired in 1887 and replaced in 1891, and the gland of the other cylinder was replaced in 1894. The main cause for concern was corrosion of the pistons. The use of canal water as a working fluid in the hydraulic system and the immersion of the pistons in the wet dock at river level led to corrosion and \\"grooving\\" of the pistons. Attempts to repair the grooves with copper made matters worse as it reacted electrolytically with the acidic canal water and hastened corrosion of the surrounding iron. In 1897 the lift was converted to use distilled water as its working fluid, slowing corrosion, but not stopping it completely. Over the next few years maintenance and repairs took place with increasing frequency, requiring complete closure of the lift for several weeks or a period of reduced and slower operation with a single caisson. Conversion to electrical operation By 1904 the Weaver Navigation Trustees faced the prospect of closing the boat lift for a considerable period to repair the hydraulic rams. They asked their Chief Engineer Colonel J. A. Saner, to investigate alternatives to hydraulic operation. Saner proposed electric motors and a system of counterweights and overhead pulleys that would allow the caissons to operate independently of each other. Although this solution involved many more moving parts than the hydraulic system these would be above ground and accessible thus making maintenance easier and cheaper and have a longer working life. Other advantages of the conversion listed by Saner included a reduction in the number of operating attendants by one and the avoidance of costly boiler repairs. Saner promised to achieve the conversion with only three short periods of closure to traffic. This was important because it minimised disruption to traffic and the loss of revenue during conversion. Anderton Boat Lift ‚Äì diagram after conversion to electrical operation (not to scale). Note that caissons can be operated independently. As a result, the weight of the caissons and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams. The superstructure was therefore strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original lift frame in order to avoid the need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a machinery deck 60 ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing each, 18 on each side to balance the weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to overcome friction between the pulleys and their bearings. A motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power. In addition to the new foundations and superstructure, the wet dock at river level was also converted into a dry dock and the aqueduct between the lift and the canal was strengthened. The original caissons were retained but were modified to take the wire ropes that now supported them on each side. Conversion was carried out between 1906 and 1908. As Saner had promised, the lift was only closed for three periods during these two years, for a total of 49 days. The converted lift was formally opened on 29 July 1908 (although one caisson had been carrying traffic on electrical power since May 1908 while the second caisson was converted). Operation after conversion After conversion to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular maintenance was still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the caissons suffered from fatigue from the repeated bending and straightening as they ran over the overhead pulleys and had to be replaced frequently. However, maintenance was simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift was above ground. Maintenance was also less expensive because the caissons were now designed to be run independently, allowing most maintenance to be carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely. During 1941 and 1942 the hydraulic rams of the original lift, which had been left in place in a shaft beneath the dry dock, were removed to salvage the iron. During the 1950s and 1960s commercial traffic on British canals declined. By the 1970s the lift's traffic was almost entirely recreational and the lift was hardly used during winter months. The new superstructure was susceptible to corrosion and the entire lift was painted with a protective solution of tar and rubber that had to be renewed every eight years or so. In 1983, during repainting, extensive corrosion was found in the superstructure and it was declared structurally unsound and closed. Restoration During the 1990s British Waterways carried out preliminary investigations before launching a restoration bid. It was originally intended to restore the lift to electrical operation but after consultation with English Heritage, in 1997 it was decided to restore the lift to hydraulic operation using hydraulic oil. To raise the ¬£7 million restoration cost, a partnership was forged between the Waterways Trust, the Inland Waterways Association, the Anderton Boat Lift Trust, the Friends of Anderton Boat Lift, the Association of Waterways Cruising Clubs, British Waterways and the Trent and Mersey Canal Society. Heritage Lottery Funding contributed ¬£3.3 million, and more than 2,000 individuals contributed to the scheme, raising a further ¬£430,000. Restoration commenced in 2000 and the lift was re-opened to boat traffic in March 2002. The site now includes a two- storey visitor centre and exhibition building with a coffee shop and information and films about the history of the lift. The visitor centre incorporates the new lift control centre. Although a modified version of the original hydraulic system was reinstated, the 1906‚Äì08 external frame and pulleys have been retained in a non-operational role. The weights that used to counterbalance the caissons were not rehung, but have been used to build a maze in the grounds of the visitor centre.

It closed in 1983 due to structural faults caused by corrosion. The Anderton Boat Lift Trust was launched in October 1993; it had been campaigning for the restoration of the lift, and succeeded in bringing together all sectors of society. The trust submitted a funding bid to the Heritage Lottery in 1997. The boat lift featured on the BBC2 programme Restoration. It was re-opened in 2002. In its first summer season, the lift saw over 100,000 visitors, 800 boats passing through, and 16,000 taking a ride on the tripboat.

Veblen asserts that the contemporary lords of the manor, the businessmen who own the means of production, have employed themselves in the economically unproductive practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure, which are useless activities that contribute neither to the economy nor to the material production of the useful goods and services required for the functioning of society, while it is the middle class and the working class who are usefully employed in the industrialised, productive occupations that support the whole of society.

That such production of goods and services was not merely the means of meeting the material needs of society, but of earning profits for the owners of the means of production. That the industrial production system required the workers (men and women) to be diligent, efficient, and co- operative, whilst the owners (businessmen and businesswomen) concerned themselves with making money and with the public display of their accumulated wealth; and that such behaviours (conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure) survived from the predatory, barbarian past of the tribal stage of modern society.\\"The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\", 15th Edition. Volume 12, p. 287. The sociology and economics applied by Veblen show the dynamic, intellectual influences of Charles Darwin and Karl Marx, Adam Smith and Herbert Spencer; thus, his theories of socio-economics emphasize evolution and development as characteristics of human institutions.. Therefore, Veblen criticised contemporary (19th-century) economic theories as intellectually static and hedonistic, and said that economists should take accounts of how people behave, socially and culturally, rather than rely upon the abstractions of theoretic deduction to explain the economic behaviours of society. Whereas neoclassical economics define people as rational agents who seek utility and maximal pleasure from their economic activities, Veblen perceived people as irrational, economic agents who pursue social status and the prestige inherent to a place in society (class and economic stratum) with little regard to their own happiness. That conspicuous consumption did not constitute social progress, because American economic development was unduly influenced by the static economics of the British aristocracy; therefore, conspicuous consumption was an un-American activity contrary to the country's dynamic culture of individualism.. Originally published as The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899), the book arose from three articles that Veblen published in the American Journal of Sociology: (i) ‚ÄúThe Beginning of Ownership‚Äù (ii) ‚ÄúThe Barbarian Status of Women‚Äù, and (iii) ‚ÄúThe Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labour‚Äù (1898‚Äì99),. which presented the major themes of economics and sociology that he later developed in works such as: The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), about how incompatible are the pursuit of profit and the making of useful goods; and The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914), about the fundamental conflict between the human predisposition to useful production and the societal institutions that waste the useful products of human effort.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 15th Edition. Volume 12, pp. 286‚Äì87.. Moreover, The Theory of the Leisure Class is a socio-economic treatise that resulted from Veblen's observation and perception of the United States as a society of rapidly developing economic and social institutions.. Critics of his reportage about the sociology and economics of the consumer society that is the U.S. especially disliked the satiric tone of his literary style, and said that Thorstein Veblen's cultural perspective had been negatively influenced by his boyhood in a Norwegian American community of practical, thrifty, and utilitarian people who endured anti-immigrant prejudices in the course of integration to American society.\\"The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\", 15th Edition. Volume 12, pp. 286‚Äì87.. Thesis In a stratified society, the profession of arms (military officer) is a leisure- class occupation. Manufacturing is an economically productive occupation for skilled-labour worker in a stratified society. (Un patron, by Jean-Eug√®ne Buland.) Conspicuous leisure: The devout observance of religious ritual is an activity for the leisure-class woman. (L'offrande, by Jean-Eug√®ne Buland, 1885.) ;The stratified society In the late 19th century, The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899) established that the economic life of a modern society is based upon the social stratification of tribal and feudal societies, rather than upon merit, that is to say, upon social and economic utility. Thorstein Veblen's anthropological examples indicate that many economic behaviours of contemporary society derive from corresponding tribal-society behaviors, wherein men and women practiced the division of labour according to their status group; high-status people practiced hunting and warfare, which are economically unproductive occupations, whilst low-status people practiced farming and manufacturing, which are economically productive occupations. ;(i) Occupation In a stratified society, the division of labour inherent to the barbarian culture of conquest, domination, and exploitation featured labour- intensive occupations for the conquered people, and light-labour occupations for the conquerors, who thus became the leisure class. Moreover, it was socially unimportant that low-status, productive occupations (tinker, tailor, chandler) were of greater economic value to society than were high-status, unproductive occupations (the profession of arms, the clergy, banking, etc.); nonetheless, for the sake of social cohesion, the leisure class occasionally performed productive work that contributed to the functioning of society, yet, such work was more symbolic participation in the economy, than it was practical economic production. ;(ii) Economic utility In exercising political control, the leisure class retained their high social-status by direct and indirect coercion, by reserving for themselves the profession of arms, and so withheld weapons and military skills from the lower social classes. Such a division of labour (economic utility) rendered the lower classes dependent upon the leisure class, and so established, justified, and perpetuated the role of the leisure class as the defenders of society against natural and supernatural enemies, because the clergy also belonged to the leisure class. In the event, contemporary society did not psychologically supersede the tribal-stage division of labour, but merely evolved different forms of said division-of-labour-by-status. During the Medi√¶val period (5th c. ‚Äì 15th c.) only land-owning noblemen had the right to hunt and to bear arms as soldiers; status and income were parallel. Likewise, in contemporary society, skilled labourers of the working class usually are paid an income, in wages, that is inferior to the income paid, in salary, to the educated professionals whose economic importance (as engineers, managers, salesmen, personnel clerks, et al.) is indirectly productive for the whole of society; income and status are parallel. ;(iii) Pecuniary emulation To attain, retain, and gain greater social status within their social class, low-status people emulate the respected, high-status members of their socio-economic class, by consuming over-priced brands of goods and services perceived to be products of better quality, and thus of a higher social-class. In striving for greater social status, people buy high-status products (goods and services) which they cannot afford, despite the availability of affordable products that are perceived as of lower quality and lesser social-prestige, and thus of a lower social-class. In a consumer society, the businessman was the latest member of the leisure class, a barbarian who used his prowess (business acumen) and competitive skills (marketing) to increase profits, by manipulating the supply and the demand among the social classes and their strata, for the same products at different prices. ;Contemporary practices of barbarian-tribe consumerism: * The subjugation of women: Because women were spoils of war captured by raiding barbarians, in contemporary society, the unemployed housewife is an economic trophy that attests to a man's socio-economic prowess. In having a wife without an independent economic life (a profession, a trade, a job) a man can display her unemployed status as a form of his conspicuous leisure and as an object of his conspicuous consumption. * The popularity of sport: In the case of American football, practicing the sport is socially and psychologically advantageous to community cohesion; yet, in itself, sport is an economic side effect of conspicuous leisure that wastes material resources. * Devout observances: Organised religion is a type of conspicuous leisure (wasted time) and of conspicuous consumption (wasted resources); a social activity of no economic consequence, because a church is an unproductive use of land and resources, and clergy (men and women) do unproductive work. * Social formalities: In contemporary society, social manners are remnants of the barbarian's formal, social practice of \\"paying respect\\" to one's socially powerful betters. In itself, etiquette has little value (practical or economic), but is of much cultural value in identifying, establishing, and enforcing distinctions of place (social stratum) within a social class; thus the practice of \\"Hail to the chief!\\" establishes a place for everyone, and establishes everyone in his and her place. Thematic overview ;Socially- conspicuous economic behaviours In the late 19th century, with The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899), Thorstein Veblen introduced, described, and explained the concepts of ‚Äúconspicuous consumption‚Äù and of ‚Äúconspicuous leisure‚Äù to the nascent, academic discipline of sociology. Conspicuous consumption is the application of money and material resources towards the display of a higher social-status (e.g. silver flatware, custom-made clothes, an over-sized house); and conspicuous leisure is the application of extended time to the pursuit of pleasure (physical and intellectual), such as sport and the fine arts. Therefore, such physical and intellectual pursuits display the freedom of the rich man and woman from having to work in an economically productive occupation.. Moreover, from the conspicuous consumption of necessary, useful goods (food, shelter, clothing, etc.) that satisfied the requirements of physical survival, there emerged the conspicuous consumption of \\"Veblen goods\\", which, as defined by the pecuniary canons of taste of the leisure class, are consumer goods valued for being expensive to make, sell, and buy; ownership of Veblen goods communicates a superior socio-economic status, either of class or of stratum, or both. ;The theses of The Theory of the Leisure Class across its fourteen chapters *Chapter I: Introductory The modern industrial society developed from the barbarian tribal society, which featured a leisure class supported by subordinated working classes employed in economically productive occupations. The leisure class is composed of people exempted from manual work and from practicing economically productive occupations, because they belong to the leisure class. *Chapter II: Pecuniary Emulation ‚ÄúThe emergence of a leisure class coincides with the beginning of ownership‚Äù initially based upon marriage as a form of ownership ‚Äì of women and their property ‚Äì as evidence of prowess. As such, the material consumption of the leisure class has little to do with either comfort or subsistence, and much to do with social esteem from the community, and thus with self-respect. √¶sthetic value to an objet d'art, such as The Cross of Mathilde (ca. AD 1000), which realises conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption in one object. *Chapter III: Conspicuous Leisure Among the lower social-classes, a man‚Äôs reputation as a diligent, efficient, and productive worker is the highest form of pecuniary emulation of the leisure class available to him in society. Yet, among the social strata of the leisure class, manual labour is perceived as a sign of social and economic weakness; thus, the defining, social characteristics of the leisure class are the ‚Äúexemption from useful employment‚Äù and the practice of conspicuous leisure as a ‚Äúnon-productive consumption of time‚Äù. *Chapter IV: Conspicuous Consumption Theoretically, the consumption of luxury products (goods and services) is limited to the leisure class, because the working classes have other, more important, things and activities on which to spend their limited income, their wages. Yet, such is not the case, because the lower classes consume expensive alcoholic beverages and narcotic drugs. In doing so, the working classes seek to emulate the standards of life and play of the leisure class, because they are the people \\"at the head of the social structure in point of reputability\\". In that emulation of the leisure class, social manners are a result of the non- productive, consumption of time by the upper social classes; thus the social utility of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure lies in their wastefulness of time and resources. *Chapter V: The Pecuniary Standard of Living In a society of industrialised production (of goods and services), the habitual consumption of products establishes a person's standard of living; therefore, it is more difficult to do without products than it is to continually add products to one's way of life. Moreover, upon achieving self- preservation (food and shelter), \\"the needs of conspicuous waste\\" determine the economic and industrial improvements of society. *Chapter VI: Pecuniary Canons of Taste To the leisure class, a material object becomes a product of conspicuous consumption when it is integrated to ‚Äúthe canon of honorific waste‚Äù, by being regarded either as beautiful or worthy of possession for itself. Consequently, to the lower classes, possessing such an object becomes an exercise in the pecuniary emulation of the leisure class. Therefore, an objet d‚Äôart made of precious metal and gemstones is a more popular possession than is an object of art made of equally beautiful, but less expensive materials, because a high price can masquerade as beauty that appeals to the sense of social prestige of the possessor-consumer. *Chapter VII: Dress as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture In a consumer society, the function of clothes is to define the wearer as a man or a woman who belongs to a given social class, not for protection from the environment. Clothing also indicates that the wearer‚Äôs livelihood does not depend upon economically productive labour, such as farming and manufacturing, which activities require protective clothing. Moreover, the symbolic function of clothes indicates that the wearer belongs to the leisure class, and can afford to buy new clothes when the fashion changes. *Chapter VIII: Industrial Exemption and Conservatism A society develops through the establishment of institutions (social, governmental, economic, etc.) modified only in accordance with ideas from the past, in order to maintain societal stability. Politically, the leisure class maintain their societal dominance, by retaining out-dated aspects of the political economy; thus, their opposition to socio-economic progressivism to the degree that they consider political conservatism and political reaction as honorific features of the leisure class. *Chapter IX: The Conservation of Archaic Traits The existence of the leisure class influences the behaviour of the individual man and woman, by way of social ambition. To rise in society, a person from a lower class emulates the characteristics of the desired upper class; he or she assumes the habits of economic consumption and social attitudes (archaic traits of demeanour in speech, dress, and manners). In pursuit of social advancement, and concomitant social prestige, the man and the woman who rid themselves of scruple and honesty will more readily rise into a stratum of the leisure class. *Chapter X: Modern Survivals of Prowess As owners of the means of production, the leisure class benefit from, but do not work in, the industrial community, and do not materially contribute to the commonweal (the welfare of the public) but do consume the goods and services produced by the working classes. As such, the individual success (social and economic) of a person derives from his or her astuteness and ferocity, which are character traits nurtured by the pecuniary culture of the consumer society. The leisure-class woman as subject and object of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure: (Idleness, by John William Godward, ca. 1900) *Chapter XI: The Belief in Luck The belief in the concept of ‚Äúluck‚Äù (Fortuna) is one reason why people gamble; likewise follows the belief that luck is a part of achieving socio-economic success, rather than the likelier reason of social connections derived from a person's social class and social stratum. Within the social strata of the leisure class, the belief in luck is greater in the matter of sport (wherein physical prowess does matter) because of personal pride, and the concomitant social prestige; hence, gambling is a display of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure. Nonetheless, gambling (the belief in luck) is a social practice common to every social class of society. *Chapter XII: Devout Observances The existence, function, and practice of religion in a socially-stratified society, is a form of abstract conspicuous consumption for and among the members of the person‚Äôs community, of devotion to the value system that justifies the existence of his or her social class. As such, attending church services, participating in religious rites, and paying tithes, are a form of conspicuous leisure. *Chapter XIII: Survivals of the Non-invidious Interest The clergy and the women who are members of the leisure class function as objects of vicarious leisure, thus, it is morally impossible for them to work and productively contribute to society. As such, maintaining a high social-class is more important for a woman of the leisure class, than it is for a man of the leisure class. Women, therefore, are the greatest indicators of a man‚Äôs socio- economic standing in his respective community. In a consumer society, how a woman spends her time and what activities she does with her time communicate the social standing of her husband, her family, and her social class. *Chapter XIV: The Higher Learning as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture Education (academic, technical, religious) is a form of conspicuous leisure, because it does not directly contribute to the economy of society. Therefore, high- status, ceremonial symbols of book-learning, such as the gown and mortar- board-cap of the university graduate educated in abstract subjects (science, mathematics, philosophy, etc.) are greatly respected, whereas certificates, low-status, ceremonial symbols of practical schooling (technology, manufacturing, etc.) are not greatly respected to the same degree, because the contemporary university is a leisure-class institution. Literary style In The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899), Thorstein Veblen used idiosyncratic and satirical language to present the consumerist mores of modern American society; about the impracticality of etiquette, as a form of conspicuous leisure, Veblen said that: In contrast, Veblen used objective language in The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), which analyses the business-cycle behaviours of businessmen; yet, in the Introduction to the 1967 edition of The Theory of the Leisure Class, the economist Robert Lekachman said that Thorstein Veblen was a misanthrope, that: Concurring with Lekachman, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, in his Introduction to the 1973 edition, said that The Theory of the Leisure Class is Veblen's intellectual put-down of American society. That Veblen spoke satirically in order to soften the negative implications of his socio-economic analyses of the U.S., which are more psychologically threatening to the American ego and status quo, than the negative implications of Karl Marx's analyses. That, unlike Marx, who recognised capitalism as superior to feudalism in providing products (goods and services) for mass consumption, Veblen did not recognise that distinction, because capitalism was economic barbarism, and that goods and services produced for conspicuous consumption are fundamentally worthless. Critical opinions ;The 19th century The publishing success of The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899) derived from the fidelity, accuracy, and veracity of Thorstein Veblen's reportage of the social and economic behavior of American society; yet, some contemporaries considered that Veblen's intellectualism made him an iconoclast who was \\"more than a little mad\\".. In that vein, despite the success (financial, academic, social) accrued to him by the book, another contemporary social scientist told Veblen that the sociology of gross consumerism cataloged in The Theory of the Leisure Class had much \\"fluttered the dovecotes of the East\\", especially in the Ivy League academic Establishment. In the contemporary (19th-century) book review '\\"The Theory of the Leisure Class\\" (September 1899), John Cummings wrote: In the two-part book review \\"An Opportunity for American Fiction\\" (April‚ÄìMay 1899), the critic William Dean Howells made Veblen's treatise the handbook of sociology and economics for the American intelligentsia of the early 20th century.. He reviewed first the economics and then the social satire in The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions; and reported that class anxiety impels American society to wasteful consumerism, especially the pursuit of social prestige by owning consumer goods. That, despite social classes being alike in most stratified societies, the novelty of the American social-class system was that the leisure class had only recently appeared in U.S. history.. Howells concluded the book review by calling upon a novelist to translate into fiction the message reported by the social-scientist Veblen, because a novel of manners was an opportunity for American fiction to accessibly communicate the satire in The Theory of the Leisure Class: ;The 20th century Twenty years later, in the book review ‚ÄúProfessor Veblen‚Äù (1919), about the author and the thesis of The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) the American intellectual and journalist H. L. Mencken asked: In the review \\"Dr. Thorstein Veblen Gets the Crown of Deadly Nightshade\\" (1919), The Theory of the Leisure Class was featured as The Dullest Book of the Month, wherein the satirist Robert Benchley said and asked: In The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899), Thorstein Veblen said that the U.S. was imitating the socially static monarchy of the United Kingdom. ;Assessments ‚Äì professional and personal Thirty years later, during which time the academic establishment of the US slowly accepted the socioeconomic facts reported in The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen was vindicated as a social scientist, by the two Middletown studies (Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture [1929] and Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts [1937]) which presented empirical evidence that working-class families practiced conspicuous consumption and did without necessities (adequate food and clothing, etc.) in order to present and maintain the public appearance of being in a higher social-class. In the Introduction to the 1934 edition of the book, the economist Stuart Chase said that the Great Depression (ca. 1929‚Äì41) had vindicated Veblen as an economist, because The Theory of the Leisure Class had unified \\"the outstanding economists of the world.\\". In the Foreword to the 1953 edition, the sociologist C. Wright Mills said that Veblen was \\"the best critic of America that America has ever produced\\".. In the Introduction to the 1973 edition of the book, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith addressed the author as subject, and said that Veblen was a man of his time, and that The Theory of the Leisure Class ‚Äì published in 1899 ‚Äì reflected Veblen's 19th- century world view. That in his person and personality, the social scientist Thorstein Veblen was neglectful of his grooming and tended to be disheveled; that he suffered social intolerance for being an intellectual and an agnostic in a society of superstitious and anti-intellectual people, and so tended to curtness with less intelligent folk. Criticism Contemporary advocates of the 18th-century school of classical economics (free markets and individual pursuit of self-interest ) have presented opinions against the cultural relevance of the socioeconomic theories of Thorstein Veblen (conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure, etc.) and for their relegation to the margin of modern economics. Among the arguments are Veblen's dismissal of the rational-expectation theories that predominate classical economics, and that the American leisure-class risk becoming irrelevant to the economy if they do not work.. The historian of economics Robert Heilbroner said that Veblen's social and economic theories were valid for the American Gilded Age (ca. 1870‚Äì1900) of gross materialism and political corruption, in the late 19th century, but are invalid for the economy of the 21st-century world, because The Theory of the Leisure Class is historically specific to U.S. society, in general, and to the society of Chicago, in particular;. thus, in the essay \\"No Rest for the Wealthy\\" (2009), the financial journalist Daniel Gross said: Yet, the \\"economy-as-organism\\" theory of Butterfly Economics have vindicated Thorstein Veblen as an insightful and foresighted economist, because his empirical observations have been re-stated by contemporary economists, such as Robert H. Frank, who applied socioeconomic analyses to the economy of the 21st century. The analytical application of the conspicuous-consumption construct to the business and economic functions of advertising explains why the lower social-classes do not experience social upward mobility in their societies, despite being the productive classes of their economies. About the limited social-utility and economic non-productivity of the business social-class, the American business entrepreneur Warren Buffett said that non-productive financial activities, such as day trading (speculative buying-and-selling of financial securities) and arbitrage (manipulation of price-differentials among markets) have vindicated The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899), because such activities only produce capital, but do not produce useful goods and services for people.

In 1969, he published the poem At Thurgarton Church, the village of Thurgarton being a few miles from Itteringham. Barker's 1950 novel, The Dead Seagull, described his affair with Smart, whose 1945 novel By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept was also about the affair.I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 38 His Collected Poems () were edited by Robert Fraser and published in 1987 by Faber and Faber. Barker was partly associated with the New Apocalyptics movement,I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 38 which reacted against 1930s realism with surrealistic and mythical themes. But his characteristically independent idiosyncrasies set him off as an individual in his own right.C. H.

Design and development Toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union saw the need for a strategic bombing capability similar to that of the United States Army Air Forces. The Soviet VVS air arm had the locally designed Petlyakov Pe-8 four-engined \\"heavy\\" in service at the start of the war, but only 93 had been built by the end of the war and the type had become obsolete. The U.S. regularly conducted bombing raids on Japan, from distant Pacific forward bases using B-29 Superfortresses. Joseph Stalin ordered the development of a comparable bomber.

By the end of the second year, the Soviet industry was to produce 20 copies of the aircraft, ready for state acceptance trials.Gordon, 2002, p.26 The Soviet Union used the metric system and so sheet aluminium in thicknesses matching the B-29's imperial measurements were unavailable. The corresponding metric-gauge metal was of different thicknesses. Alloys and other materials new to the Soviet Union had to be brought into production. Extensive re- engineering had to take place to compensate for the differences, and Soviet official strength margins had to be decreased to avoid further redesign.Gordon, 2002, p.20 However despite those challenges, the prototype Tu-4 weighed only about more than the B-29, a difference of less than 1%.Gordon, 2002, p.24 The engineers and suppliers of components were under pressure from Tupolev, Stalin, and the government to create an exact clone of the original B-29 to facilitate production. Tupolev had to overcome substantial resistance to use equipment that was not only already in production but also sometimes better than the American version.Gordon, 2002, pp.15‚Äì25 Each alteration and every component made were scrutinized and was subject to a lengthy bureaucratic process. Kerber, then Tupolev's deputy, recalled in his memoirs that engineers needed authorization from a high- ranking general to use Soviet-made parachutes. Differences were limited to the engines, the defensive weapons, the radio (a later model used in lend-lease B-25s was used in place of the radio in the interned B-29s) and the identification friend or foe (IFF) system since the American IFF was unsuitable.Gordon, 2002, pp.24‚Äì25 The Soviet Shvetsov ASh-73 engine was a development of the Wright R-1820 but was not otherwise related to the B-29's Wright R-3350Gordon, 2002, pp.21 & 24 The ASh-73 also powered some of Aeroflot's remaining obsolescent Petlyakov Pe-8 airframes, a much-earlier Soviet four-engined heavy bomber, whose production was curtailed by higher- priority programs. The B-29's remote-controlled gun turrets were redesigned to accommodate the Soviet Nudelman NS-23, a harder hitting and longer ranged 23 mm cannon.Gordon, 2002, p.25 Additional changes were made as a result of problems encountered during testing related to engine and propeller failures,Gordon, 2002, p.27 and equipment changes were made throughout the aircraft's service life.Gordon, 2002, pp.66‚Äì68 The Tu-4 first flew on 19 May 1947 and was piloted by test pilot Nikolai Rybko.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p. 98. Serial production started immediately, and the type entered large-scale service in 1949. Entry into service of the Tu-4 threw the USAF into a panic since the Tu-4 possessed sufficient range to attack Chicago or Los Angeles on a one-way mission, and that may have informed the maneuvers and air combat practice conducted by US and British air forces in 1948 involving fleets of B-29s.\\"Archival RAF film of combat with B-29s.\\" google.com.

The tests were conducted by the RAF Central Fighter Establishment and co-operative US B-29 groups and involved demonstration of recommended methods of attack against B-29/Tu 4-type bombers using RAF Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. The Soviets had developed four different midair refueling systems to extend the bomber's range, but these were fitted to only a few aircraft, and only a small number of the final design was installed on operational aircraft before the Tu-4 was superseded by the Tu-16.Gordon, 2002, pp.50-53 First public appearance The aircraft was first displayed during a flyover at the Aviation Day parade on 3 August 1947 at the Tushino Airport in Moscow. Three aircraft flew overhead. It was assumed that they were merely the three B-29 bombers that were known to have been diverted to the Soviet Union during World War II. Minutes later a fourth aircraft appeared. Western analysts realized that the Soviets must have reverse-engineered the B-29.Dow, James. \\"Parade.\\" The Arrow. Retrieved: 29 December 2009.

Operational history A total of 847 Tu-4s had been built when production ended in the Soviet Union in 1952, some going to China during the later 1950s. Many experimental variants were built and the valuable experience launched the Soviet strategic bomber program. Tu-4s were withdrawn in the 1960s, being replaced by more advanced aircraft including the Tupolev Tu-16 jet bomber (starting in 1954) and the Tupolev Tu-95 turboprop bomber (starting in 1956). By the beginning of the 1960s, the only Tu-4s still operated by the Soviets were used for transport or airborne laboratory purposes.

She was the first ship in the United States Navy to feature the auto loading Mark 16 8-inch/55 caliber gun, the first of its type in the world, and the second ship of its name in the U.S. Navy.  Construction  Des Moines was launched 27 September 1946 by Bethlehem Steel Company, Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. E. T. Meredith, Jr.; and commissioned 16 November 1948, Captain A. D. Chandler in command. She became the first of her class to mount the semi-automatic Mark 16 8-inch turrets and carry the new Sikorsky HO3S-1 utility helicopters in place of seaplanes. She was named after the capital of the state of Iowa.  Naval service  Des Moines off Boston in November 1949 USS Des Moines (CA-134) underway at sea on 30 November 1959. In a varied operating schedule designed to maintain the readiness of the Navy to meet the constant demands of defense and foreign policy, Des Moines cruised from her home port at Newport, Rhode Island and after 1950, from Norfolk, Virginia on exercises of every type in the Caribbean, along the East Coast, in the Mediterranean Sea, and in North Atlantic waters. Annually between 1949 and 1957 she deployed to the Mediterranean, during the first seven years serving as flagship for the 6th Task Fleet (known as the 6th Fleet from 1950). In 1952, and each year from 1954 to 1957, she carried midshipmen for summer training cruises, crossing to Northern European ports on the first four cruises. She also sailed to Northern Europe on NATO exercises in 1952, 1953, and 1955. On 18 February 1958, she cleared Norfolk for the Mediterranean once more, this time to remain as flagship for the 6th Fleet until July 1961 when was placed out of commission in reserve. Through her Mediterranean services Des Moines contributed significantly to the success of the 6th Fleet in representing American power and interests in the countries of Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East. She made this contribution through such activities as her participation in NATO Mediterranean exercises; her call to seldom-visited Rijeka, Yugoslavia, in December 1950 and Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, in May 1960, and to many other ports as a regular feature of her schedule; her cruising in the eastern Atlantic during the wake of the Suez Crisis of 1956; and service on patrol and as control center for American forces in the Lebanon crisis of 1958. Film footage of her cruising with other ships of the United States 6th Fleet was used in the introduction and conclusion of the movie John Paul Jones, starring Robert Stack (Warner Brothers 1959).  Decommissioning  Des Moines being towed to the scrapyard, in October 2006 After decommissioning in 1961 she was mothballed in the South Boston Naval Annex and eventually laid up in the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia in maintained reserve. In 1981 the United States Congress directed that the Navy conduct a survey to determine if she and sister ship could be reactivated (in lieu of two ) to support the 600-ship Navy proposed by the Reagan Administration. The study concluded that while both ships would be useful in the active fleet, there was not enough deck space to add the modern weapons systems (Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Phalanx CIWS mounts, radars and communication systems) that the ships would need to operate in a 1980s environment. In addition, the per-ship costs for the reactivation and updates (that were determined feasible) would be close to the costs for an Iowa, for a much less capable ship. Therefore, both ships remained in maintained reserve until they were struck off the reserve list in August 1993. After an attempt to turn her into a museum ship in Milwaukee, Wisconsin failed, she was sold in 2005, and then towed to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping. By July 2007, she had been completely broken up. Her status officially changed to \\"disposed of by scrapping, dismantling\\" on 16 August 2007.

She was named after the city of Flint, Michigan. She was launched on 25 January 1944 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. R. A. Pitcher. She was and commissioned on 31 August 1944, with Captain C. R. Will in command. She was reclassified CLAA-97 on 18 March 1949. Service history Flint reported to the 3rd Fleet for duty at Ulithi on 27 December 1944, and six days later, sailed with Task Force 38 (TF 38) for a month-long cruise in support of the invasion of Luzon. She screened aircraft carriers as they launched strikes on Luzon, Taiwan, and the China coast, and fired protective anti-aircraft cover during a Japanese kamikaze attack on 21 January 1945. Replenishing at Ulithi from 26 January to 10 February, Flint then sailed with newly designated TF 38 for air strikes on Tokyo preceding the attack on Iwo Jima. Her force arrived off Iwo Jima on 21 February to provide anti-aircraft cover for the Marines who had landed two days previously, and Flint returned to Ulithi 12 March for a brief 2 days of replenishment. Putting to sea with TF 58 for strikes against Ky≈´sh≈´ in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa, Flint aided in bringing down several airplanes in heavy attacks on the task force from 18 to 22 March. The task force then closed Okinawa, and Flint with other cruisers bombarded beach installations in preparation for the landings on 1 April. Aside from the period of 14‚Äì24 May, when she was at Ulithi for upkeep, Flint operated off Okinawa until 13 June, when she anchored in Leyte Gulf. Flint sortied from Leyte on 1 July to screen the final air attacks on the Japanese home islands and to join the bombardment of the east coast of Honsh≈´ until the cessation of hostilities. On 24 August, she took station off Nii Shima to serve as rescue ship and homing station for transport planes carrying occupation troops to Japan. From 10 to 15 September, she lay in Tokyo Bay, then sailed with a carrier task force to provide air and sea surveillance of Central Honsh≈´ until 21 September. The cruiser made a voyage from Japan to Eniwetok, then loaded homeward bound servicemen at Yokosuka on 13 October, bringing them into San Francisco Bay on 28 November. After sailing to Kwajalein to bring home more servicemen eligible for discharge, Flint reported at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 11 January 1946, and there was placed out of commission in reserve at Bremerton on 6 May 1947. Her dedication plaque currently rests in the Sloan Museum, in the city she is named after. Awards Flint received four battle stars for World War II service.

It is a part of the British Overseas Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It is located northeast from Bristol Island and south from Saunders Island. The island was first sighted by James Cook in 1775, and named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and the First Lord of the British Admiralty at the time of its discovery. The first recorded landing was made by the Norwegian whaler and explorer Carl Anton Larsen in 1908. Geography The desolate, uninhabited island measures approximately , with over 90% of its surface permanently covered in ice. The volcano Mount Belinda is its most notable geographic feature, rising to above sea level. It was believed to be inactive prior to the sighting of low-level ash emission and suspected lava effusion in 2002 by the British Antarctic Survey. Mount Belinda In November 2005, satellite images revealed that an eruption of Mount Belinda had created a molten river flowing to the northern shoreline of the island. The event has expanded the area of the island by , and provided some of the first scientific observations of volcanic eruptions taking place underneath an ice sheet. , imaging on Google Earth shows the volcano to be active with a noticeable plume and lava flow.

The requirements vary from country to country. In many countries, licensing or certification is similar for gliders and powered aircraft. Training must be undertaken from a certified instructor, and a license or certificate is then issued by the government, limited to gliders only. The exception is when a pilot is flying under Ultralight (Ultralite) glider rules within the United States. The aviation knowledge and skill requirements for a glider are usually similar to those for a powered aircraft, taking into account the different requirements of the aircraft categories. Most countries also require medical certificates for pilots, although in some countries \\"self-certification\\", i.e., a legal statement that one is fit to fly, is allowed for gliders. The United States does not require a medical certificate to operate a glider with a U.S. airman certificate. Canada also permits glider pilot license holders to self-certify, but requires regular medical examinations for gliding instructors. In some countries, glider instruction and licensing are regulated by a national non-governmental organisation representing the gliding community. This is true in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. New Zealand also issues a government license to pilots who fly for fees and for those who wish their qualifications to be accepted more readily overseas. Countries vary in their acceptance of pilot licenses from other countries to fly aircraft registered in the home country. Many permit pilots to fly on their home licenses for short periods, others insist on conversion to their license. Generally, a pilot may fly an aircraft registered in their home country with their home country's license or certificate, in any other country, subject to international conventions.  Canada   United States   United Kingdom  The minimum age for a solo glider flight in the UK is 14. A driving licence is adequate evidence of medical fitness for solo flight, and pilots under the age of 25 may self-certify. Failing this a medical certificate is required from the pilot's own doctor, to the same standard as a provisional driving licence, unless the pilot has a higher certificate such as the EASA Class 2 medical required for a PPLBGA Medical Requirements, retrieved 2018-09-19.. Gliding in the UK is regulated by the British Gliding Association (BGA) and by its member clubs. Training is based on standards defined by the BGA and is conducted by instructors who have been trained on its courses. Further practical training is required after solo, plus a multiple choice test which is very similar to the PPL theory exam, before a pilot is given an endorsement to fly cross-country. Most flights do not require radio contact with air traffic control units, but some pilots obtain a radio operator's licence should that eventuality arise. There is no government-issued licence at present, but EASA regulations will require one by 2015. At present the Gliding Certificate is issued by the BGA under delegation from the Royal Aero Club and indicates the standard of achievement reached by the pilot. The certificate is endorsed for each requirement met, and also shows sporting achievements for the FAI's gliding badges, plus the UK's own 100 km and 750 km Diplomas. EASA Throughout Europe the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is the rulemaking body responsible for pilot licensing. For glider pilots there are two options: * The Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (Sailplanes) (LAPL(S)) is a sub-ICAO licence, meaning it does not have to be accepted in non-EASA countries. * The Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL) is an ICAO-recognised licence, valid worldwide. In some EASA member states (notably the UK), a lower medical standard applies to the LAPL(S), such that a pilot may choose the LAPL medical instead of a Class 2 medical. During the transition period, UK pilots may self-declare medical fitness, being restricted to UK-registered EASA aircraft. Crucially, a pilot exercising the rights of a SPL may receive remuneration but the holder of a LAPL(S) may not.

Although little information exists on Cantillon's life, it is known that he became a successful banker and merchant at an early age. His success was largely derived from the political and business connections he made through his family and through an early employer, James Brydges. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon speculated in, and later helped fund, John Law's Mississippi Company, from which he acquired great wealth. However, his success came at a cost to his debtors, who pursued him with lawsuits, criminal charges, and even murder plots until his death in 1734. Essai remains Cantillon's only surviving contribution to economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, but was not published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, and the development of spatial economics. Cantillon's Essai had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat and Fran√ßois Quesnay. Biography While details regarding Richard Cantillon's life are scarce,Spengler , p. 283; writes Spengler, \\"Much of the life of Richard Cantillon, author of the Essai, remains enveloped in mystery.\\" it is thought that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland.Brewer 1992, p. 2; Brewer notes two suggested dates of birth, but puts greater weight on the validity of Antoine Murphy's estimate, \\"Murphy thinks that Cantillon was probably born in the 1680s, at Ballyronan in County Kerry, Ireland; Walsh says that he was born in 1697 (which is hard to square with the fact that he was in a position of responsibility in 1711)\\". Spengler , p. 283; Spengler cites Hone and mentions the same uncertainty in Cantillon's date as birth, \\"He was born in Ireland, in , according to Hone, and some seven to seventeen years earlier according to others.\\" He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue.Higgs 1891, p. 270; Higgs cites the so-called Burke's Heraldic Illustrations, 1845, plate 51. Sometime in the middle of the first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship.Brewer 1992, p. 2; Higgs 1891, pp. 271‚Äì72 By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession.Brewer 1992, p. 2 Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris.Finegold ; \\"Paymaster General James Brydges was a very wealthy man with much influence, which allowed Cantillon to make political and business connections before again leaving for France in 1714.\\" Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank.Brewer 1992, p. 4; Finegold ; Rothbard 1995, p. 345 Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank.Brewer 1992, p. 4; Finegold Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his familyRothbard 1995, p. 345; writes Rothbard, \\"Moreover, Richard's mother's uncle, Sir Daniel Arthur, was a prominent banker in London and Paris ...\\" and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.Brewer 1992, pp. 4‚Äì5 At this time, Cantillon became involved with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company.Rothbard 1995, pp. 345‚Äì46; Brewer 1992, p. 5 Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract The Key of Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply would lead to the employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity.Rothbard 1995, pp. 327‚Äì30; Finegold In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the Banque G√©n√©rale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance its debt at low rates of interest.Brewer 1992, pp. 5‚Äì6; Finegold Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque G√©n√©rale's virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.Brewer 1992, p. 6; Finegold ; Rothbard 1995, pp. 329, 345‚Äì46 Richard Cantillon amassed a great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early and selling them later at higher prices, even though he had stated he believed Law's \\"scheme was unsound and was bound to fail.\\"Brewer 1992, p. 6; writes Brewer, \\"He was introduced to Law at an early stage ... Most important, he bought shares early and sold at a large profit, thinking that the scheme was unsound and was bound to fail.\\" Brewer also notes that Cantillon was acting as John Law's personal banker, at the time. Cantillon's financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours.Higgs 1891, 276; Cantillon's reply is according to Higgs, who records Law as follows: \\"His great credit during the Regency aroused the jealousy of John Law, who held blunt language with him: 'I can send you to the Bastille to-night if you don't give me your word to quit the kingdom in four and twenty hours! Cantillon replied: \\"I shall not go away; but I will make your system succeed.\\" To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator Joseph Gage formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.Finegold ; Rothbard 1995, p. 346 In 1719, Cantillon left Paris for Amsterdam, returning briefly in early 1720. Lending in Paris, Cantillon had outlying debt repaid to him in London and Amsterdam.Brewer 1992, p. 7; Brewer suggests that Cantillon stored his wealth in London to avoid high French taxes levied on those who had profited from the speculative bubble. Hyse 1971, p. 815; Hyse writes that profits were remitted both to London and Amsterdam, \\"The English records indicate that Cantillon remitted his speculative profits from Paris to Amsterdam and London.\\" With the collapse of the \\"Mississippi bubble\\", Cantillon was able to collect on debt accruing high rates of interest.Rothbard 1995, p. 346; Rothbard notes that these high interest rates incorporated an inflation premium. Most of his debtors had suffered financial damage in the bubble collapse and blamed Cantillon‚Äîuntil his death, Cantillon was involved in countless lawsuits filed by his debtors, leading to a number of murder plots and criminal accusations.Brewer 1992, pp. 7‚Äì8; Rothbard 1995, pp. 346‚Äì47 On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, daughter of ‚Äîa wealthy merchant and former Irish general‚Äîspending much of the remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife.Higgs 1891, pp. 282‚Äì83; Rothbard 1995, pp. 346‚Äì47 Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta,Higgs 1871, pp. 282, 288 wife successively of the 3rd Earl of Stafford and the 1st Earl of Farnham. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London.Higgs 1891, p. 286; Spengler , p. 284 In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire.Rothbard 1995, p. 347; Hayek 1991, p. 246; Higgs 1891, p. 290 While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered.Brewer 1992, p. 8 One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.Brewer 1992, p. 8; Brewer restates Murphy's argument, where Murphy cites the fact that the so- called Chevalier de Louvigny carried a large number of documents related to Cantillon. Contributions to economics Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En G√©n√©ral (abbreviated Essai) survives.Brewer 1992, p. 9 Written in 1730,Cantillon 2010, p. 13; In the introduction to the Ludwig von Mises Institute's 2010 edition of Essai, Mark Thornton and Chantal Saucier write, \\"Based on the book itself and other evidence, we are now reasonably confident that Cantillon completed the manuscript in 1730.\\" Brewer, p. 9 it was published in French in 1755,Spengler , p. 61; Essai was published roughly twenty-one years after Cantillon's death. and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932.Hone 1994, p. 96 Evidence suggests that Essai had tremendous influence on the early development of economic science. However, Cantillon's treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century.Cantillon 2010, p. 15 In the late 19th century and it was \\"rediscovered\\" by William Stanley Jevons, who considered it the \\"cradle of political economy\\".Jevons 1881, p. 342; writes Jevons, \\"Cantillon's essay is, more emphatically than any other single work, 'the cradle of political economy.'\\" Cantillon 2010, p. 15; Editors Mark Thornton and Chantal Saucier write, \\"The influence of Cantillon's manuscript was largely unknown and the book had fallen so far into neglect that William Stanley Jevons was said to have \\"rediscovered\\" it in the late 19th century.\\" Since then, Cantillon's Essai has received growing attention. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory,Jevons 1881, pp. 341‚Äì43; writes Jevons, \\"The Essai is far more than a mere essay or even collection of disconnected essays like those of Hume. It is a systematic and connected treatise, going over in a concise manner nearly the whole field of economics, with the exception of taxation.\\" Rothbard 1995, p. 345; Cantillon 2010, p. 13; Brewer 1992, p. 11 and Cantillon has been called the \\"father of enterprise economics\\".Cantillon 2010, p. 5 William Petty is considered to be one of Richard Cantillon's greatest influences. One of the greatest influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes.Jevons 1881, p. 343; Like Cantillon, Petty proposed that the value of an object was the aggregate of the land and labor involved in its production. Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon's Essai,Schumpeter 1954, p. 210; Schumpeter states, \\"What Petty failed to accomplish‚Äîbut for what he had offered almost all the essential ideas‚Äîlies accomplished before us in Cantillon's Essai.\\" Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's influence has been overstated.Brewer 1992, p. 15; Brewer states, \\"I shall argue that Cantillon took very little from Petty, and that he completely remade the little that he did take.\\" Schumpeter 1954, p. 210; Schumpeter concedes, \\"True, it was not accomplished in the style of a pupil who at every step looks back over his shoulder for the master's guidance, but in the style of an intellectual peer who strides along confidently according to his own lights.\\" Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke,Brewer 1992, p. 15 Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard.Higgs 1892, p. 437 Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight on the relationship between increases in the supply of money, price, and production.Hyse 1971, p. 823 Methodology Cantillon's Essai is written using a distinctive causal methodology, separating Cantillon from his mercantilist predecessors.Salerno 1985, p. 305 Essai is peppered with the word \\"natural\\", which in the case of Cantillon's treatise is meant to imply a cause and effect relationship between economic actions and their underlying (i.e. causing) phenomena.Hayek 1991, pp. 259‚Äì60 Economist Murray Rothbard credits Cantillon with being one of the first theorists to isolate economic phenomena with simple models, where otherwise- uncontrollable variables can be fixed.Rothbard 1995, p. 348 Cantillon made frequent use of the concept of ceteris paribus throughout Essai in an attempt to neglect independent variables.Hayek 1991, pp. 260‚Äì61; Cantillon 2010, pp. 70‚Äì71; an example Cantillon's use of ceteris paribus can be found in chapter twelve, part one, of Essai, \\"The land belongs to the owners but would be useless to them if it were not cultivated. The more labor is expended on it, other things being equal, the more it produces ...\\" Furthermore, he is credited with employing a methodology similar to Carl Menger's methodological individualism,Finegold ; Carl Menger is credited with providing the Austrian School the methodological insight which would lead to Ludwig von Mises's development of praxeology. by deducing complex phenomena from simple observations.Salerno 1985, p. 306 A cause and effect methodology led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships.Hayek 1991, p. 260 This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics to a greater degree than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists,Brewer 1988; Thornton ; Thornton 2007 given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli.Brewer 1988, p. 447 Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.Thornton 2007, p. 4; Mark Thornton writes, \\"When this handful of selected quotes is placed into the proper historical and textual context they can even take on the possibility of being arguments against mercantilism and for a more laissez faire economy.\\" Monetary theory Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise early in Essai, regarding the origins of wealth and price formation on the market.Finegold ; writes Finegold, \\"Cantillon's insights on the source of economic wealth also set him apart from typical mercantilists before him.\\" Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself \\"nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life.\\"Cantillon 2010, p. 21; Editors Mark Thornton and Chantal Saucier provide an abstract, stating, \\"Cantillon defines wealth as the consumption goods produced by land and labor. This contrasted with the Mercantilists who thought money was wealth.\\" While Cantillon advocated an \\"intrinsic\\" theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production),Rothbard 1995, pp. 349‚Äì50; Cantillon 2010, pp. 53‚Äì56 he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value.Rothbard 1995, pp. 349‚Äì50; Cantillon 2010, p. 55; writes Cantillon, \\"But it often happens that many things, which actually have a certain intrinsic value, are not sold in the market according to that value; that will depend on the desires and moods of men, and on their consumption.\\" Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand.H√ºlsmann 2002, p. 696 He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged.Cantillon 2010, p. 119; \\"The price of meat will be determined after some bargaining, and a pound of beef will be valued in silver [i.e., money] approximately the same as all beef offered for sale in the market [i.e., supply], is to all the silver brought there to buy beef [i.e., demand].\\" Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle‚Äîchanges in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.Cantillon 2010, p. 119; Finegold ; Tarascio 1985, p. 252 Rendition of Cantillon's primitive circular flow modelCantillon 2010, p. 66 In Essai, Cantillon provided an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and the velocity of money.Cantillon 2010, p. 148; \\"Mr. Locke lays it does as a fundamental maxim that the quantity of goods in proportion to the quantity of money is a regulator of market prices. I have tried to elucidate his idea in the preceding chapters: he had clearly seen that the abundance of money makes everything more expensive, but he has not considered how this happens. The great difficulty of this question consists in knowing in what way and in what proportion the increase of money raises the prices of things.\\" Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money.Rothbard 1995, p. 355 Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living at the expense of later recipients.Rothbard 1995, p. 356 The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon Effect.Cantillon 2010, p. 155; Bordo 1983, p. 242 Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money.Cantillon 2010, pp. 147‚Äì48 While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes‚Äîor bank notes‚Äîcould affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie.Bordo 1983, p. 237 Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie‚Äîor fiduciary media‚Äîsuggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability.Spengler , pp. 414‚Äì15 He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.Cantillon 2010, pp. 227‚Äì30 Addressing the mercantilist belief that monetary intervention could cause a perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories.Rothbard 1995, p. 359 He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries where there is a relative scarcity of money.Spengler , p. 418; Rothbard 1995, pp. 358‚Äì59 Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices.Bordo 1983, p. 244 However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness.Brewer 1992, p. 114 Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.Brewer 1992, pp. 117‚Äì18 A relatively advanced theory of interest is also presented.Hayek 1991, p. 265; Hayek notes that Cantillon's theory of interest was overlooked by Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk, who wrote Capital and Interest as a critique of existing theories of interest in order to set up the introduction of his own time-preference theory of interest. This is meant to illustrate the obscurity of Cantillon's Essai to the economics profession prior to its \\"rediscovery\\" by Jevons. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for the risk of the possible insolvency of the debtor.Cantillon 2010, pp. 169‚Äì70 In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital.Cantillon 2010, pp. 170‚Äì71 While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds marketBordo 1983, p. 247; Brewer 1992, p. 91‚Äîan insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume.Hayek 1991, pp. 265‚Äì66 As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory of interest is therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.Bordo 1983, pp. 247‚Äì48, 253 Other contributions Traditionally, it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is credited for coining the word and advancing the concept of the entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai.Brewer 1992, p. 51; Anthony Brewer, however, distinguishes between Say's and Cantillon's use of the term \\"entrepreneur\\", noting that while Cantillon saw the entrepreneur as a risk-taker, Say predominately considered the entrepreneur a \\"planner\\". Cantillon divided society into two principal classes‚Äîfixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners.Rothbard 1995, p. 351; H√ºlsmann 2002, p. 698. H√ºlsmann argues that Cantillon divided society into four classes: politicians, property owners, entrepreneurs, and wage- earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes,Tarascio 1985, p. 251 due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product.Cantillon 2010, p. 74; \\"They [entrepreneurs] pay a fixed price for them at the place where they are purchased, to resell wholesale or retail at an uncertain price ... These entrepreneurs never know how great the demand will be in their city ...\\" Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty‚Äîthe topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others.Tarascio 1985, pp. 251‚Äì52 Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.Rothbard 1995, p. 352 Spatial economics deal with distance and area, and how these may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier.H√©bert 1981, p. 71 Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres‚Äîthat is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs.Rothbard 1995, p. 354 Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that are more difficult to transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production.H√©bert 1981, p. 72 For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation.Cantillon 2010, pp. 31‚Äì32 Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs‚Äîwealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs.Cantillon 2010, pp. 35‚Äì36 In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.H√©bert 1981, p. 75 Cover of the Ludwig von Mises Institute's edition of Cantillon's Essai Apart from originating theories on the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon also provided a dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed a considerable amount of unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only as long as there are economic opportunities present.Brewer 1992, p. 36; Brewer notes that Cantillon's theory on population was nearly identical to that of Malthus, who presented his own theory decades after Cantillon's death. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture.Tarascio 1985, pp. 249‚Äì50 Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed.Rothbard 1995, p. 353 Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.Tarascio 1985, pp. 250‚Äì51 Influence While the Essai was not published until 1755 as a result of heavy censorship in France, it did widely circulate in the form of an unpublished manuscript between its completion and its publication.Rothbard 1995, p. 360 It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the classical school of thought, including Turgot and other physiocrats.Rothbard 1995, pp. 360‚Äì61 Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat Fran√ßois Quesnay, who has probably had access to his work through the marquis de Mirabeau, who possessed a manuscript of the Essai since 1740.Schumpeter 1954, pp. 209‚Äì10; writes Schumpeter, \\"Cantillon's great work fared better both because of its well-rounded systematic or even didactic form and because it had the good fortune to gain, long before its actual publication, the enthusiastic approval and the effective support of two very influential men, Gournay and Mirabeau.\\" Furthermore, Schumpeter establishes, \\"An analogy may be helpful: Cantillon was to Quesnay, and Petty was to Cantillon, what Ricardo was to Marx.\\" While it is evident that the Essai influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon's theories.Brewer 1992, p. 168; Brewer cites a conversation between Quesnay and Mirabeau, as chronicled by the latter. Many of Quesnay's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in the Essai,Brewer 1992, pp. 174‚Äì75 but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon's premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon's population theory.Brewer 1992, pp. 159‚Äì75 Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the \\"father of physiocracy\\" by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay.Higgs 1892, p. 454 It is also possible that Cantillon influenced Scottish economist James Steuart, both directly and indirectly.Brewer 1992, p. 175; Brewer cites Steuart's reference to a tract by Phillip Cantillon, which in turn was based largely on Essai, and the many similarities between Steuart's Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy and Cantillon's Essai. Cantillon is one of the few economists cited by Adam Smith, who directly borrows Cantillon's subsistence theory of wages.Smith 2009, p. 45; \\"Mr. Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of common labourers must everywhere earn at least double their own maintenance, in order that, one with another, they may be enabled to bring up two children.\\" Cantillon 2010, pp. 59‚Äì65; Marx 2007, p. 608, n. 1 Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon.Brewer 1992, pp. 192‚Äì93 Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably SchumpeterSchumpeter 1954, p. 179; Schumpeter charged, \\"But no matter what he actually learned or failed to learn from predecessors, the fact is that the Wealth of Nations does not contain a single analytic idea, principle, or method that was entirely new in 1776.\\" and Rothbard.Rothbard 1995, p. 435; Rothbard wrote, \\"The problem is that he originated nothing that was true, and that whatever he originated was wrong; that, even in an age that had fewer citations or footnotes than our own, Adam Smith was a shameless plagiarist, acknowledging little or nothing and stealing large chunks, for example, from Cantillon.\\" In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre- classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school.Hayek 1991, p. 246 Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Jean-Baptiste Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.Salerno 1985, p. 312 References Bibliography             * Category:1680s births Category:1734 deaths Category:17th-century Irish people Category:18th-century Irish writers Category:18th-century male writers Category:18th-century economists Category:Irish writers Category:Irish economists Category:Irish expatriates in France Category:People from County Kerry Category:Physiocrats Category:Preclassical economists Category:Freemasons of the Premier Grand Lodge of England ","title":"Richard Cantillon"},{"id":"562317","text":"The Latsis Foundation (French: Fondation Latsis internationale) is a charitable foundation, founded in 1975 by the Greek shipping magnate John Latsis.

The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W.

His \\"Million-Dollar Bunco Ring\\" was brought to justice in a famous trial in 1923. Blonger's gang set up rooms resembling stock exchanges and betting parlors that were used by several teams to run \\"big cons\\". The goal of the con was to convince tourists to put up large sums of cash in order to secure delivery of stock profits or winning bets. The depiction of the \\"Wire Con\\" seen in the movie The Sting is a fairly accurate representation of a typical big con. Blonger had longstanding ties to numerous Denver politicians and law enforcement officials, including the mayor and the chief of police. In 1922, however, District Attorney Philip S. Van Cise bypassed the Denver police and used his own force, funded by donations solicited in secret from local citizens, to arrest 33 con men, including Blonger, and bring the ring to justice.  Childhood  Lou Blonger was born in Swanton, Vermont, on May 13, 1849, the eighth of 13 children. His father, Simon Peter Belonger, was a stonemason born in Canada of French ancestry. His mother, Judith Kennedy, was raised in an orphanage in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland.Swinbank Family Bible, in possession of Joseph Swinbank. (Mary Swinbank was Lou Blonger's sister.) The Belonger family migrated from Vermont to the lead mining village of Shullsburg, Wisconsin, when Lou was five years old. After his mother died in 1859, Lou lived with his older sister and her husband for a few years. Around this time Blonger began using a shortened version of the family name (omitting the first \\"e\\"), as most of his brothers did. Blonger followed brothers Mike and Joe into the Union Army in 1864. Although he was still three days shy of his 15th birthday, Blonger was mustered in as a fifer at Warren, Illinois, and served a few weeks with Company B of the 142nd Illinois Regiment before suffering a leg injury at White Station, Tennessee. He spent the remainder of his 100-day enlistment recovering at the Marine Hospital in Chicago.Blonger pension file. At the conclusion of the Civil War, Blonger reunited with his brother Sam, ten years his elder, who had spent the war years prospecting in Colorado and driving freight over the mountains in California and Nevada. Lou was living in Mount Carroll, Illinois, with a friend named William Livingston when Sam returned. While Sam courted and eventually married Livingston's sister Ella, Lou attended high school. Later Sam sent his brother to study at Bryant & Stratton Business College in Chicago.  In the Western boomtowns  In 1870 Sam and Lou Blonger, along with many of the Livingstons, left the Midwest for the western frontier. Following the path of the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad, they briefly ran a hotel and saloon in Red Oak, Iowa, before moving on to Salt Lake City, Utah and the nearby mining towns of Stockton and Dry Canyon. In a pattern that repeated itself at many of their stops, Lou owned and operated saloons with assorted entertainments while Sam developed mining claims in the surrounding mountains, served occasionally as a peace officer and, in his spare time, raced horses. Similar stops followed in Virginia City, Nevada; Cornucopia, Nevada; Silver Reef, Utah; and again in Salt Lake City. Moving to Colorado in 1879, Lou Blonger took a shot at running a vaudeville theater in Georgetown, while Sam made an unsuccessful bid to become the first mayor of nearby Leadville. p. 213. There the Blongers were joined by two other brothers: Simon, the eldest, who worked as superintendent at the Robert E. Lee Mine, and Marvin, the youngest, also a miner. Available at ancestry.com. Soon afterward, Sam and Lou were on the move again, this time to the burgeoning railroad town of New Albuquerque, New Mexico (soon to merge with Albuquerque).  Albuquerque days  Sam Blonger was appointed marshal of New Albuquerque in February 1882 and quickly deputized his brother. Newspaper accounts indicate that while the brothers engaged in a few shootouts and jailed their share of vagrants, they also took plenty of time off to pursue other interests: prospecting, horse racing, and even running a brothel.See series of newspaper clippings at BlongerBros.com. For a couple of months the Blongers were toasted as the solution to the town's law enforcement problem (a previous marshal, Milt Yarberry, had murdered two citizens). When Sam and Lou were joined briefly by brother Joe, a prospector in the nearby Cerrillos Hills, a local newspaper wrote: \\"The three brothers are all of them young, nervy and square western men and it would be a good thing for the town if they were all on the police force.\\" In April 1882, Lou Blonger served as acting town marshal while Sam traveled to Denver to negotiate the sale of a mine. Lou's stint roughly coincided with the escape to New Mexico by the Vendetta Posse, composed of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and five others. Hoping to make their way to legal sanctuary in Colorado, the men took temporary refuge in New Albuquerque after killing several men to avenge the murder of Wyatt's brother Morgan. According to one theory, Lou or Sam (or both) may have been called upon to provide shelter for the posse members during their stay. Sam Blonger's appointment as marshal of New Albuquerque lasted just five months. He was relieved of his duties while on a trip to Kansas City, and soon afterward, Lou and Sam split up for the only extended period of their adult lives. Lou spent the next few years in the New Mexico towns of Silver City, Deming, and Kingston, living at least part of the time with Frank Thurmond, a well-known gambler, and his wife, Carlotta Thompkins (better known as Lottie Deno). Blonger also got married, probably in 1884, to Emma Loring. In 1888, a woman calling herself Kitty Blonger shot and killed a man who tried to break into her room in a Peach Springs, Arizona, brothel. Lou Blonger soon arrived to arrange her defense, and eventually she was acquitted. Kitty had previously worked in Albuquerque, where she had a soiled reputation. She may have been one of Blonger's madams, but the exact nature of their relationship has not been determined.  The Denver underworld  Soon after the Kitty Blonger trial, Lou Blonger relocated permanently to Denver, rejoining his brother Sam. The pair operated several saloons and gambling houses in the area of Larimer Street and Seventeenth Street over the next few years, including the magnificent Elite Saloon at 1628 Stout Street, with its mahogany fixtures and frescoed ceiling. In addition to hosting the typical array of poker and faro tables, the Blongers' operation also branched out into the \\"policy racket\\" (also known as the \\"numbers game\\"), an illegal lottery that paid out on a daily basis. The Blongers aggressively targeted tourists, who were lured to the saloon by a network of henchmen called \\"steerers\\" and then cheated out of their money. The sophistication of the swindles developed over time. In the early years they were as simple as marked cards or loaded dice; later, elaborate \\"big cons\\" became the Blonger trademark. Denver had a reputation as a wide-open town in the 1890s. Gambling shops bought protection from the police force and the mayor's office and operated openly except when occasional crackdowns were required for show. In addition to making direct payments to authorities, Sam and Lou Blonger also engaged in election fraud for candidates from both parties, from Denver mayor Wolfe Londoner in 1890 to Congressman Robert W. Bonynge in 1902. Testimony in the latter case indicated that Blonger's network of steerers had already been in place for several years. The Blongers' policy shop had plenty of competition, including saloon man Ed Chase and Soapy Smith, the famous Western con man. Smith was an uneasy Blonger ally for a while, but the frequent quarrels between steerers from the rival groups suggested a confrontation was brewing. In 1895 Smith went on a drunken rampage through several Larimer Street establishments including the Blongers' saloon, where police removed him; one account alleged that Lou Blonger was crouched behind the cigar counter, ready to unload a shotgun.Collier, p. 208. In the wake of the rampage, Smith and his brother Bascomb were charged with the attempted murder of a saloon manager. Realizing he had lost control of the situation, Soapy left for the mining boomtown of Skagway, Alaska, in 1897, ceding control of Denver's underworld to Lou Blonger.Collier, p. 209-10.  The Forest Queen  In 1892 Sam and Lou Blonger found the gold mine they had been looking for in the mountains above Cripple Creek, Colorado, and named it the Forest Queen ().Forest Queen location certificate, filed 1892-04-18. Sam and Lou had several partners in the mine at different stages of its development, some of whom were extraordinarily well-placed. Two of them, Neil Dennison and Robert W. Steele, served as district attorney in Denver during the 1890s. Dennison was the son of a former governor of Ohio and Steele later became chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court.Jackson. A third partner of note was J. W. McCulloch, manufacturer of Green River Whiskey, who supposedly traded 20 barrels of his product for a piece of Lou Blonger's stake. Once developed, the Forest Queen provided its owners with periods of steady income, if not the fortune that came out of the nearby Independence Mine. Lou and Sam Blonger claimed, bought, traded, and sold several mines in their lives, but both held onto the Forest Queen to the end, leaving their interest to their wives. The Blongers were keen observers in the frequent labor struggles between miners and mine owners. Conditions reached a head in 1894 during the \\"Battle of Bull Hill\\", when striking miners took up arms in the hills near the Forest Queen. Lou Blonger and several allies from Denver were frequent visitors to the area during the months-long dispute and its aftermath, calling themselves \\"detectives\\". \\"Million-Dollar Bunco Ring\\" As his gang branched out into bigger and more complicated \\"big cons\\" that attracted a more well-to- do clientele, Lou Blonger found he no longer needed his saloon and the relatively small take it provided from card and dice games. Eventually he moved into headquarters in the American National Bank building on Seventeenth Street and styled himself as a mining magnate. A crucial moment in the development of the bunco gang was Blonger's partnership in 1904 with Adolph W. Duff, who had operated his own gang of confidence men in Colorado Springs before being run out of town by the police.Van Cise, p. 10. With Duff handling the details of coordinating gang members and scheduling locations for the scams, Blonger was free to conduct the business of schmoozing public officials and bribing law enforcement, all while cultivating the image of a model citizen. In the summertime he made the rounds of friendly politicians and policemen, paying off favors with boxes of cherries from his orchard in suburban Lakewood.Van Cise, p. 11. For the next 18 years Blonger and his gang operated virtually unmolested by local law enforcement. Gang members were specifically instructed not to solicit victims from Colorado, concentrating instead on out-of-state tourists who would find it difficult to help prosecute a criminal case. Only twice during this period did Blonger come close to arrest. The first was in 1910, when he escaped prosecution in connection with the Maybray Gang of Council Bluffs, Iowa.Van Cise, p. 9. The second occurred in 1915, when Blonger was implicated in a swindling scheme uncovered by carpenters remodeling his office building. Sam Blonger's participation in his brother's gang waned as bigger and more sophisticated cons were developed, and he died in 1914. Meanwhile, Lou Blonger expanded the gang's home base from Denver, where it operated only during the warmest months, southward to Miami and Havana, Cuba. During the winter Blonger relaxed at Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he reportedly compared notes with his old friend Allan Pinkerton, president of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.Van Cise, p. 96-97. Van Cise refers to Pinkerton as simply \\"the great detective.\\"  Investigation and arrest  During the 1920 primary election for Denver district attorney, Blonger approached Republican Party candidate Philip S. Van Cise and offered assistance in the way of campaign contributions and votes. To Blonger's surprise, Van Cise turned down his offer, and after his election, Van Cise called Blonger into his office to warn him that one of his goals would be the eradication of Blonger's gang of con men.Van Cise, p. 13-19. Recognizing that the police force was in Blonger's pocket, Van Cise undertook a private investigation underwritten by donations from 31 wealthy benefactors.Van Cise, p. 59-66. Over the course of a year, his detectives gathered information and watched the habits and movements of the gang members. Van Cise monitored Blonger's trash, spied on him from a building across the street, and had a Dictaphone installed surreptitiously inside his office (an action that did not require a search warrant at the time). He also allowed a crooked police detective to work inside the district attorney's office, feeding him misleading information to confuse the gang.Van Cise, p. 111-16, 91-95. In the summer of 1922, Van Cise made it well known he was going on a long fishing vacation to the Rocky Mountains, signaling to the gang members that the heat was off their operation.Van Cise, p. 164-65. While the con men plied their trade openly on the streets of Denver, Van Cise and his assistants plotted a huge roundup that required a willing victim to help catch the gang in the act. With incredible good fortune, J. Frank Norfleet showed up in Denver at precisely this moment. Norfleet was a Texas rancher who had previously been scammed twice by other gangs and was on a nationwide manhunt to bring the men who swindled him to justice. Entering the lobby of the Brown Palace Hotel, Norfleet was hooked by unwitting gang members who saw him as an easy mark, and the plan was set in motion.Van Cise, p. 182-94.Norfleet, p. 260-323. The posse assembled early on the morning of August 24, 1922: eighteen Colorado Rangers to arrest the gang members and several private citizens to chauffeur them to a holding cell in the basement of the First Universalist Church. Blonger and Duff were among the first to be arrested; eventually 33 gang members were hauled in before news of the raid reached the street, allowing the remainder of the gang to flee.Van Cise, p. 173-209. Although newspapers across the country carried the particulars of the unusual sting, the Denver Post at first declined to print Blonger's name. Co-publisher Harry Tammen was a close friend of Blonger's, but his partner Fred Bonfils ordered the paper's editors to end the embargo and support Van Cise and the prosecution of the \\"Million-Dollar Bunco Ring\\".Van Cise, p. 212-13. The nickname the papers hung on the gang didn't tell half the story. The con men's total haul was impossible to determine, but in any case was well in excess of a million dollars per year.  Trial  Blonger had a host of legal talent at his disposal, not to mention a sympathetic judge or two. His personal lawyer, Thomas Ward, Jr., was a former U.S. district attorney who had argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. While the rest of the gang was represented by lesser names, they all benefited from the roadblocks laid down by the lead lawyers in the conspiracy case. The defense successfully fought to have Van Cise removed from the prosecution of the case on a technicality, but Van Cise considered this a tactical error, since it allowed him to spend more time devising the prosecution's strategy and less time in court. The case proceeded with two special prosecutors, S. Harrison White, former chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, and Harry C. Riddle, a former district court judge.Van Cise, p. 238-41. The trial began on February 5, 1923. Day after day the prosecution called a series of victims, bilked out of their life savings, to the stand. The star witness, however, was Len Reamey, one of the gang's bookmakers, fourth in the hierarchy behind Blonger, Duff, and bookmaker Jackie French. Reamey provided the inside story of how the gang defrauded hundreds of victims and divided the spoils among themselves. When the prosecution rested after seven weeks of testimony, the defense attorneys surprised everyone by resting their case without presenting a witness, and further by offering to forgo their closing arguments if the prosecution did the same. Van Cise directed the special prosecutors to call their bluff, and so the case went immediately to the jury without any closing arguments.Van Cise, p. 321-39. During the trial rumors were rampant that the jury had been fixed. Blonger's men approached at least four of the jurors, but struck out when they attempted to bribe Herman M. Okuly, a mechanic. Okuly played along with the offer, but immediately reported the deal to his boss, who informed Van Cise. After four days of deliberations, with three jurors still favoring acquittal, Okuly played his ace, telling the holdouts \\"the difference between me and you is that I got my five hundred dollars, but turned it over to the Judge, and you've still got yours.\\"Van Cise, p. 323-26, 342. The three relented, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty for the 20 defendants who remained on trial.Van Cise, p. 342-44.  Incarceration and death  Blonger's health, poor even before his arrest, grew increasingly worse during the long trial. In the days after his conviction, while he was still battling to stay out of prison, Blonger received a final blow when the Denver Post revealed that he had led a double life for 20 years, living with his wife, Nola, on weekends and a mistress, Iola Readon, during the week. Rocked by the revelation, he reconciled with his wife, transferring his property to her in anticipation of his incarceration. As one legal appeal after another failed, Blonger made a final plea to Van Cise to remain free, a plea the district attorney forcefully rejected: Lou Blonger's headstone in Fairmount Cemetery Blonger was driven in a special car to the Colorado State Penitentiary on October 18, 1923, and died there on April 20, 1924, succumbing to organ failure. His funeral, held at Denver's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, was attended by hundreds of people from all walks of life. Despite his wishes to be buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery, his wife directed that he be interred at Fairmount Cemetery instead. Family Lou Blonger married twice. In 1882 or 1884 in San Francisco, he married Emma Loring, about whom nothing is known. Blonger received an uncontested divorce in 1889 on the grounds of desertion and quickly married 30-year-old Cora \\"Nola\\" Lyons (n√©e Morehouse), who was said in younger days to have been a \\"successful variety actress.\\"Van Cise, p. 6. Blonger had no children. Upon Nola's death the remainder of Blonger's estate, including his interest in the Forest Queen Mine, passed to her fourth husband, William J. MacAuley.

She was launched by William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia 22 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Clark Wallace Thompson. The cruiser's construction was suspended when nearly complete on 24 June 1946; and the hull assigned to the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CLG-93 on 4 February 1956; then reclassified to CLG-3 on 23 May 1957; and commissioned at Philadelphia 28 May 1958, Captain J. B. Colwell in command. 1958-1960 Refit as a Galveston-class guided missile light cruiser, the warship departed Philadelphia on 30 June 1958 for builder's trials out of Norfolk, Va., in the Virginia Capes area, that included \\"highly successful\\" tests of her new Talos missile and tracking gear. The Talos supersonic surface-to-air missile was 38 ft long, weighed nearly 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), and was powered by a novel 20,053 lbf ramjet engine, plus a solid-fuel rocket booster. With a range of over 65 miles (105 km) for early variants, and over 100 for later ones, and speeds of up to Mach 4, it was designed to destroy enemy aircraft at high altitudes using either a conventional or atomic warhead. She finished out the year with operations in the Norfolk area. Galveston arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 16 January 1959, for training and evaluation operations in the waters of the West Indies. She successfully launched the first Talos missile ever fired at sea on 24 February 1959. The Talos was termed by Admiral Arleigh Burke as \\"the best antiaircraft missile in any arsenal in the world\\". Galveston reported the shot \\"hot, straight and normal\\" as she proudly proved her capability as one of the most mighty warships of the modern United States Navy. The cruiser set course for Norfolk on 17 March and a special yard period in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. In July 1959, Galveston conducted shakedown and acceptance trials in the Virginia Capes area, followed by a refresher training cruise to waters off Cuba and the testing of her radar and communications in war games with the U.S. Air Force. On 4 January 1960, she departed Norfolk for a visit to Charleston, South Carolina, and operations off the Florida coast, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. She then headed to her namesake city of Galveston, arriving on 16 February for a Silver Service presentation. Returning to Norfolk, the cruiser unloaded her ammunition for shock tests off the Bahamas, then entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 25 March 1960 for a yard period that extended into the fall. During this time the cruiser entertained more than 30,000 visitors. She headed for the Virginia Capes 24 October 1960, successfully completing her first missile transfer at sea. 1961 On 6 January 1961, Galveston departed Norfolk for more Bureau of Naval Weapons technical evaluation of her Talos missile systems, including tests of the IV Talos, its capabilities and potentials, in areas off Jacksonville, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These evaluations completed 1 March, she departed San Juan for refresher training and her final acceptance trial out of Guantanamo Bay. The cruiser returned to Norfolk on 9 April, but soon steamed to Jacksonville, where on 8 May she began duty under the Operational Technical Evaluation Force that included extensive testing of her missile system and many Talos firings. The effectiveness of the system and the weapon were demonstrated by a new, long-range record as well as a successful two-missile salvo shot. The Talos missile cruiser entertained over 17,000 visitors at Cape Canaveral on the Armed Forces weekend celebration in May; completed later phases of her evaluation exercises in the Caribbean through 21 July 1960; then visited Bayonne, New Jersey, where her missile fire-control radars were removed in preparation for overhaul. Galveston was overhauled in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (30 August 1961 ‚Äì 23 July 1962). This overhaul included modifications to the fire control system of the Talos missile. The visit to Charleston was for electronic equipment repair. She had to go in at low tide, and lightning rods had to be lowered to pass under the Charleston bridge. 1962-1964 Galveston departed Philadelphia on 23 July 1962, transited the Panama Canal for San Diego, California; and joined Cruiser- Destroyer Flotilla 9, U.S. Pacific Fleet, on 24 August 1962. While home-ported in San Diego she continued trials with the Talos. The Talos was fired successfully at an old destroyer escort, striking it above decks and exiting above the waterline. No explosives were used. She operated along the West Coast until October 1963 when she sailed for the Western Pacific as flagship of the flotilla. During the next six months she operated in the Far East with the 7th Fleet off Japan, Taiwan, and Okinawa. She returned to San Diego 16 April 1964 and resumed West Coast training. 1965 Following a four-month overhaul from October 1964 to February 1965, Galveston departed San Diego 4 June for operations off the coast of South Vietnam. She touched at Subic Bay, Philippines, 21 June, then sailed to join the 7th Fleet in the South China Sea. During the next 5 months she ranged the Southeast Asian waters from the Gulf of Thailand to the Gulf of Tonkin while supporting the American effort to repel Communist aggression in South Vietnam. She provided gunfire support during search-and-clear operations at Chu Lai and at the Vung Tuong Peninsula. In addition she provided air defense for 7th Fleet carriers in the South China Sea and conducted search and rescue operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. She departed the Philippines on 2 December and arrived at San Diego on 18 December. 1966-1967 Resuming operations early in January 1966, Galveston operated out of San Diego to the Hawaiian Islands and along the California coast while keeping her crew and equipment in a peak state of readiness. From 31 July to 4 November she underwent modernization overhaul, then she resumed training for the remainder of 1966. Early in 1967 she departed San Diego for the East Coast, and for much of the rest of that year was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet for duty in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. 1968-1969 On 19 October 1968, Galveston departed Seal Beach, California on her final Westpac tour. She divided her time between operations on Yankee Station in the north and the Da Nang area in the south where she temporarily replaced the on the gun line, firing 3,500 rounds of ammunition from her 5\\"/38 and 6\\"/47 caliber Mark 16 guns in one nine-day period. She effectively supported Republic of Korea Marines in the Delta area. Galveston returned to San Diego on 2 February 1969. She departed San Diego for the East Coast and duty with the Atlantic Fleet performing duties in the Mediterranean.

Named after K√∂nigsberg,Now Kaliningrad, Russia. the capital of East Prussia, she was laid down in January 1905, launched in December of that year and completed by June 1906. Her class included three other ships: , , and . K√∂nigsberg was armed with a main battery of ten guns and had a top speed of . After her commissioning, K√∂nigsberg served with the High Seas Fleet's reconnaissance force. During this period, she frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht on visits to foreign countries. In April 1914, the ship was sent on what was to have been a two- year deployment to German East Africa, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in August of that year. K√∂nigsberg initially attempted to raid British and French commercial traffic in the region, but only destroyed one merchant ship in the course of her career. Coal shortages hampered her ability to attack shipping. On 20 September 1914, she surprised and sank the British protected cruiser in the Battle of Zanzibar. K√∂nigsberg then retreated into the Rufiji River to repair her engines. Before the repairs could be completed, British cruisers located K√∂nigsberg, and, unable to steam into the river to destroy her, set up a blockade. After several attempts to sink the ship during the Battle of Rufiji Delta, the British sent two monitors, and , to destroy the German cruiser. On 11 July 1915, the two monitors got close enough to severely damage K√∂nigsberg, forcing her crew to scuttle the ship. The surviving crew salvaged all ten of her main guns and joined Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's guerrilla campaign in East Africa. K√∂nigsberg was partially broken up in 1963‚Äì1965 for scrap, and the remains sank into the riverbed. Design Line-drawing of the K√∂nigsberg classThe diagram mistakenly refers to the class as the Stettin class and does not include K√∂nigsberg K√∂nigsberg and her sisters were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany's colonial empire. This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the Kaiserliche Marine from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 142, 157 K√∂nigsberg was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eleven coal-fired water- tube boilers rated at . These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . K√∂nigsberg had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, p. 104 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/40 guns in single pedestal mounts. There were two side by side forward on the forecastle, six amidships, three on either side, and two side by side aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 157 The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. K√∂nigsberg also carried ten SK guns in single mounts. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick amidships. The conning tower sides were thick. Service history Construction and early career Pre-war photo of K√∂nigsberg K√∂nigsberg was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 12 January 1905.German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as \\"Ersatz (name of the ship to be replaced)\\". She was launched on 12 December 1905, when the Oberb√ºrgermeister of K√∂nigsberg, Siegfried K√∂rte, christened the ship, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet for sea trials on 6 April 1907. Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht during three sailing regattas including Kiel Week. The two ships then cruised the North Sea and stopped at Nordkapp, where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar Nicholas II of Russia. After returning to Germany, K√∂nigsberg resumed her sea trials, which lasted from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser on 5 November. At this time, K√∂nigsberg was again used to escort Wilhelm II's yacht, this time in company with the new armored cruiser and the dispatch boat on a visit to Britain. The ships stopped in Portsmouth and the Thames, and were visited by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 138‚Äì139 On 17 December, K√∂nigsberg was tasked with another goodwill visit, this time escorting the Kaiser's brother, Prince Heinrich, and a delegation of naval officers to Malm√∂, Sweden to meet King Oscar II. The visit lasted until 20 December. K√∂nigsberg participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident. The year ended with a major training cruise, first in the Baltic and North Sea and later into the Atlantic, that ended in early December. The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908‚Äì09 for periodic maintenance, emerging for service again in early February 1909. A typical training routine followed for the next two years, interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser on 16 February 1910 in the Kiel Bay, and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910; the first to Helgoland on 9‚Äì13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May. The collision with Dresden caused significant damage to both ships, though no one on either vessel was injured. Both ships were repaired in Kiel. K√∂nigsberg also won the Kaiser's Schie√üpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 139 From December 1909 to September 1910, Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Adolf von Trotha served as the ship's commander.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 138 From 8 March to 22 May 1911, K√∂nigsberg cruised in the Mediterranean Sea with Wilhelm II aboard Hohenzollern. On 10 June, K√∂nigsberg was replaced in the reconnaissance force by the new cruiser ; K√∂nigsberg was transferred to Danzig, where she was placed out of service on 14 June for modernization work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was recommissioned for service with the fleet, to replace the cruiser which was also being modernized. This service lasted until 19 June, when K√∂nigsberg was again placed in reserve in Kiel. During this period of active service, she was assigned to the training squadron from 1 to 18 April. In early 1914, the high command decided to send K√∂nigsberg to German East Africa, where she would replace the current station ship, the old unprotected cruiser . East Africa station SMS K√∂nigsberg at Bagamoyo, June 1914 On 1 April 1914, Fregattenkapit√§n Max Looff took command of the ship. K√∂nigsberg left Kiel on 25 April, stopped in Wilhelmshaven, and then left three days later for a two-year deployment to German East Africa. She steamed into the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Spanish and Italian ports before entering the Suez Canal.Farwell, p. 128 After passing through the canal, she stopped briefly in Aden before arriving in Dar es Salaam, the capital of German East Africa, on 5 June. Two days later, the Schutztruppe (Protection Force) celebrated their 25th anniversary in the colony; the deputy commander of the Schutztruppe presented Looff with a model of the cruiser , which had been the longest serving warship with the unit. K√∂nigsberg surveyed the harbor at Bagamoyo later in the year.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 139‚Äì140 The African colonial subjects considered the ship to be quite impressive, particularly her three funnels, which were assumed to signify a warship more powerful than one with only two funnels. The ship acquired the nickname Manowari na bomba tatu, or \\"the man of war with three pipes\\".Patience 2001, p. 27 As tensions in Europe rose in the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 140 Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up K√∂nigsberg at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day.Farwell, pp. 128‚Äì129 K√∂nigsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.Farwell, p. 129 World War I At the outbreak of World War I, K√∂nigsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around the entrance to the Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to K√∂nigsberg.Halpern, p. 77 Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. K√∂nigsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. K√∂nigsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 141 On 6 August, K√∂nigsberg found a British ship off the coast of Oman, the freighter City of Winchester. A prize crew took the ship along with K√∂nigsberg, and the two vessels met Zieten four days later in the Khuriya Muriya Islands, where coal from City of Winchester was transferred to K√∂nigsberg. The freighter was thereafter sunk. The British crew was taken aboard Zieten, which departed the following day and stopped in Mozambique. Meanwhile, the steamer Somali, under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (Corvette Captain) Zimmer, had left Dar es Salaam with a cargo of of coal on the night of 3‚Äì4 August to resupply K√∂nigsberg; the two ships met ten days later. By the time Looff rendezvoused with Somali, his ship was down to a mere of coal. Somali transferred some of coal to the cruiser, which permitted a sweep to Madagascar. No British or French ships were found, however, and so K√∂nigsberg met Somali again on 23 August and took on coal for four days of cruising.Farwell, p. 131 In the meantime, British warships bombarded Dar es Salaam and destroyed the German wireless station there.Bennett, p. 131 By this time, K√∂nigsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff needed to find a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship M√∂we. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, K√∂nigsberg passed over the bar at the mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed at the mouth of the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them.Farwell, p. 132 Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply K√∂nigsberg, observed a British cruiser‚ÄîPegasus‚Äîpatrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 142 One of K√∂nigsbergs guns emplaced in the delta On 19 September, K√∂nigsberg left the Rufiji and arrived off Zanzibar the following morning. She opened fire at a range of about at 05:10, starting the Battle of Zanzibar; within 45 minutes, Pegasus caught fire, rolled over to port, and sank. Crewmen aboard Pegasus had raised a white flag, but it could not be seen aboard K√∂nigsberg due to the heavy smoke. Pegasuss crew suffered 38 dead and 55 wounded, while K√∂nigsberg was undamaged and had no casualties. After sinking Pegasus, K√∂nigsberg bombarded the wireless station and dumped barrels filled with sand into the harbor entrance to simulate mines. While leaving the harbor, K√∂nigsberg spotted the picket ship Helmut and sank her with three shells.Farwell, p. 133 The cruiser then returned to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.Bennett, p. 133 Concerned with the threat K√∂nigsberg posed to troop transports from India, the British reinforced the flotilla tasked with tracking down the elusive German raider, and placed the ships under the command of Captain Sidney R. Drury-Lowe. The sinking of Pegasus convinced the British that K√∂nigsberg must still be in German East Africa. On 19 October, the cruiser found the German East Africa Line ship Pr√§sident at Lindi. A boarding party searched the ship and discovered documents indicating she had supplied K√∂nigsberg with coal in the Rufiji the previous month. On 30 October, the cruiser located K√∂nigsberg and Somali in the delta.Halpern, p. 78 The cruisers Chatham, Dartmouth, and blockaded the Rufiji Delta to ensure K√∂nigsberg could not escape.Bennett, pp. 132‚Äì133 =Battle of Rufiji Delta= The battered K√∂nigsberg after she was scuttled On 3 November, the British began a bombardment in an attempt to destroy or neutralize K√∂nigsberg and Somali. K√∂nigsberg was protected by the thick mangrove swamps, which concealed the ship and offered a degree of cover from British shellfire, especially while the British ships remained outside the river. A collier, Newbridge, was converted into a blockship to be sunk in the main channel of the delta to prevent K√∂nigsbergs escape. Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river, the British successfully sank Newbridge across one of the delta mouths on 10 November, though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels. Looff decided to move his ship further upriver, to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her. In doing so, his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere. In the course of the campaign, the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers, including and the Australian .Willmott, p. 292 A civilian pilot, Denis Cutler of Durban, South Africa, was commissioned into the Royal Marines and persuaded to make his private Curtiss seaplane available for the British Empire.Turner, pp. 39‚Äì40 The Royal Navy requisitioned the passenger ship to serve as a makeshift tender for Cutler's aircraft.Patience 2011, p. 70 On his first attempt to locate the cruiser, Cutler, who did not have a compass, got lost and was forced to land on a desert island. On his second flight, he successfully located K√∂nigsberg, and a third flight with a Royal Navy observer confirmed his observations. His aircraft's radiator was damaged on the flight by ground fire and he was grounded until replacement parts could be brought from Mombasa. A pair of Royal Naval Air Service Sopwiths were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship. They soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of Short seaplanes fared a little better, though they too were quickly disabled by the conditions. Also in November, the British sought to use the guns of the old battleship to sink the cruiser. The attempt was unsuccessful, once again because the shallow waters prevented the battleship from getting within range.Burt, p. 158 In December, Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck requested as many crew members from the ship as possible for the East Africa Campaign against the British; a total of 220 men were left aboard to keep the ship in fighting condition. This was not enough, however, to permit the ship to go to sea. K√∂nigsberg moved further up the river on 18 December. On 23 December, the British used a pair of shallow- draft ships to sail up the delta. They hit Somali once before German defensive fire forced them to retreat.Farwell, p. 138 Aerial photo of K√∂nigsberg after her scuttling; note the removal of her guns In the meantime, conditions were deteriorating on K√∂nigsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although safe from the British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally cut off from the outside world, the morale of the sailors fell.Farwell, pp. 137‚Äì138 However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, K√∂nigsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, K√∂nigsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.Farwell, pp. 139‚Äì142 Finally, in April 1915, the British Admiralty agreed to a plan submitted by Drury-Lowe the previous November, which envisioned attacking the German cruiser with shallow-draft monitors, capable of navigating the Rufiji River. Two of the warships, and , armed with a pair of guns each, were brought from Britain. K√∂nigsberg had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver. On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be from K√∂nigsberg, which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors' navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of K√∂nigsbergs guns.Bennett, p. 134 She hit Mersey twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline.Patience 2001, pp. 114‚Äì115 K√∂nigsberg was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding.Patience 2001, p. 121 In the span of three hours, K√∂nigsberg forced both British ships to withdraw. K√∂nigsberg gun in the field (1916) They returned again on 11 July, after having repaired the damage sustained in the first attempt. The two monitors conducted a five-hour bombardment. K√∂nigsberg opened fire at 12:12, initially with four guns, but only three guns remained in action after 12:42, two guns after 12:44, and one gun after 12:53. The two monitors did not respond until 12:31, once they had been anchored into their firing positions,Patience 2001, pp. 122‚Äì123 and scored several serious hits that caused a major fire at the ship's stern and inflicted heavy casualties. By 13:40, K√∂nigsberg had run low on ammunition and her gun crews had suffered very heavy casualties, and so Looff ordered the crew to abandon ship and to drop the breech blocks for the guns overboard to disable them. Two torpedo warheads were detonated in the ship's bow to scuttle her; the ship rolled over slightly to starboard and sank up to the upper deck with her flags still flying. Nineteen men had been killed in the battle, with another forty-five wounded, including Looff.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 144 Later that day, the crew returned to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day.Patience 2001, pp. 131‚Äì132 The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; together with the ship's crew, they went on to see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow- Vorbeck.Herwig, pp. 154‚Äì155 All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry G√∂tzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet.Patience, pp. 133‚Äì134 The surviving sailors, organized as the K√∂nigsberg-Abteilung (K√∂nigsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.Yates, p. 289 K√∂nigsberg bow shield, on display at the Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden In 1924, John Ingle, the former captain of Pegasus, was tasked with clearing wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, he bought the salvage rights to K√∂nigsberg for the price of ¬£200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5 cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.Patience 2011, p. 72 Footnotes Citations References       * Further reading  Category:1905 ships Category:K√∂nigsberg Category:K√∂nigsberg- class cruisers (1905) Category:Maritime incidents in 1915 Category:Military history of German East Africa Category:Ships built in Hamburg Category:Shipwrecks in rivers Category:Shipwrecks of Africa Category:World War I cruisers of Germany Category:World War I shipwrecks Category:Scuttled vessels of Germany ","title":"SMS K√∂nigsberg (1905)"},{"id":"562348","text":"The Anglo-Nepalese War (1 November 1814 ‚Äì 4 March 1816), also known as the Gurkha War, was fought between the Kingdom of Gorkha (present-day Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and the East India Company (EIC, present-day India). Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded some Nepalese controlled territory to the EIC. The war was led by the EIC (a private company that was closely tied to the British Empire) with the support from native states; Garhwal Kingdom, Patiala State and Kingdom of Sikkim against Kingdom of Gorkha. The war on the side of Kingdom of Gorkha was led mostly by the members of the larger Thapa caucus. Historical background The Shah era of Nepal began with the Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah invading Kathmandu valley, which consisted of the capital of the Malla confederacy. Until that time only the Kathmandu valley was referred to as Nepal. The confederacy requested help from the East India Company and an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 was led by Captain Kinlock in 1767. The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkhali army easily overpowered those who had not succumb to malaria or desperation . This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhali with a few firearms to arms themselves and make effective use of them. Victory and occupation of the Kathmandu Valley by Prithvi Narayan Shah, starting with the Battle of Kirtipur, resulted in the shift of the capital of his kingdom from Gorkha to Kathmandu, and subsequently the empire that he and his descendants built came to be known as Nepal. Also, the invasion of the wealthy Kathmandu Valley provided the Gorkha army with economic support for furthering their martial ambitions throughout the region. To the north however, aggressive raids into Tibet (concerning a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes) triggered Chinese intervention. In 1792 the Qianlong Emperor sent an army, expelling the Nepalese from Tibet to within of their capital at Kathmandu. Acting regent Bahadur Shah (Prithvi Naryan's younger son) appealed to the then British Governor-General of India for help. Anxious to avoid confrontation with the Chinese, the Governor-General did not send troops but sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator. However, before he arrived the war with China had finished. In 1789, Tibetan government stopped the usage of Nepalese coins for trade in Tibet, citing purity concerns over the copper and the silver coins minted by the Nepalese government,Historical money of Tibet which led to the first Nepal-Tibet war. A resounding victory of Gorkha forces over Tibetans in the first Nepal-Tibet war left the Lhasa Durbar with no choice but to ask for assistance from the Qing Emperor in Peking. In the immediate aftermath of the Sino-Nepalese War (1789‚Äì1792), Nepal was forced to sign the 'Treaty of Betrawati' which stipulated that the Government of Nepal was required to make payment of tribute to Qing court in Peking once every five years, after the defeat of Gurkha forces by the Qing army in Tibet. The Tibet affair had postponed a previously planned attack on the Garhwal Kingdom, but by 1803 the Raja of Garhwal, Pradyuman Shah, had also been defeated. He was killed in the struggle in January 1804 and all his land annexed. Further west, general Amar Singh Thapa overran lands as far as Kangra ‚Äì the strongest fort in the hill region ‚Äì and laid siege to it. However, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Sikh state in Punjab, intervened and drove the Nepalese army east of the Sutlej river by 1809. Causes Map of India in 1805 The British were also expanding their sphere of influence at an alarming rate. While the Nepalese had been expanding their empire ‚Äì into Sikkim in the east, Kumaon and Garhwal in the west and into the British sphere of influence in Awadh, or Oudh as the British called it, in the south ‚Äì the British East India Company had consolidated its position in India from its main bases of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. This British expansion had already been resisted in India, culminating in three Anglo-Maratha wars as well as in the Punjab where Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Empire had their own aspirations. Trade The economic cause constituted the major cause of conflict with Nepal. The British had made constant efforts to persuade the Nepalese government to allow them their trade to the fabled Tibet through Nepal. Despite a series of delegations headed by William Kirkpatrick (1792), Maulvi Abdul Qader (1795), and later William O. Knox (1801), the Nepalese Durbar refused to budge an inch. The resistance to open up the country to the Europeans could be summed up in a Nepalese precept, \\"With the merchants come the musket and with the Bible comes the bayonet.\\" Lord Hasting was not averse to exploiting any commercial opportunities that access to the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was at this time in the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).Pemble, Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War, p.366 So when Hastings told the directors of the Company about an alternative means of remittance, a rare and precious raw material that could easily and profitably be shipped from India directly to London, they were at once interested. The raw material in question was a superior-quality wool: the exquisitely soft and durable animal down that had been used since time immemorial to make the famous wraps, or shawls, of Kashmir. This down was found only on the shawl-wool goat, and the shawl-wool goat was found only in certain areas of western Tibet. It refused to breed anywhere else. This all explains why, under the terms of the treaty of 1816, Nepal was required to surrender its far western provinces. Hastings hoped that this territory, partly annexed by the Company and partly restored to its previous rulers, would give British merchants direct access to the wool-growing areas. Similarly David Ochterlony, then an agent at Ludhiana, on 24 August 1814 noted of Dehra Dun as a \\"potentially thriving entrepot for Trans-Himalayan trade.\\" He contemplated annexing Garhwal not so much with the view to revenue, but for security of commercial communications with the country where the shawl wool is produced. The British soon got to know that Kumaon provided a better facility for trade with Tibet. Therefore, the annexation of these two areas became part of their strategic objectives. Political safety While trade was indeed a major objective of the Company, out of it grew a concept of \\"political safety,\\" which essentially meant a strategy of dissuasion and larger areas of occupation. The evidence does not support the claim that Hastings invaded Nepal only for commercial reasons. It was a strategic decision. He was wary of the Hindu revival and solidarity among the Marathas, the Sikhs, and the Gurkhas amid the decaying Mughal empire. He was hatching pre-emptive schemes of conquest against the Marathas in central India, and he needed to cripple Nepal first, in order to avoid having to fight on two fronts. That it was a flawed strategy is explained by P.J. Marshal: \\"Political safety meant military preparedness. The military expenditure for 1761‚Äì62 to 1770‚Äì71 was 44 percent of the total spending of 22 million pounds. War and diplomacy rather than trade and improvement; most of the soldiers-would-be politicians and Governor Generals rarely understood. The political safety of Bengal was their first priority and they interpreted safety as requiring the subjugation of Mysore, the Marathas, the Pindaris, the Nepalese and the Burmese.\\" Border dispute The acquisition of the Nawab of Awadh's lands by the British East India Company brought the region of Gorakhpur into the close proximity of the raja(king) of Palpa ‚Äì the last remaining independent town within the Nepalese heartlands. Palpa and Butwal were originally two separate principalities; they were afterwards united under one independent Rajput prince, who, having conquered Butwal, added it to his hereditary possessions of Palpa. The lands of Butwal, though conquered and annexed, were yet held in fief, or paid an annual sum, first to Awadh, and afterwards, by transfer, to the British.Anon (1816), p.425.Oldfield, p. 40. During the regency of Rani Rajendra Laxmi, towards the close of the 18th century, the hill country of Palpa was conquered and annexed to Nepal. The rajah retreated to Butwal, but was subsequently induced, under false promises of redress, to visit Kathmandu, where he was put to death, and his territories in Butwal seized and occupied by the Nepalese.Oldfield, p. 40. Bhimsen Thapa, the Nepalese prime minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. The occupation of Terai of Butwal from 1804 till 1812 by the Nepalese, which was under British protection, was the immediate reason which led to the Anglo-Nepalese war in 1814.Smith, Warlike Preliminaries, Ch. 8, p. 172.Prinsep, Ch. 2, Causes of Nipal War, p. 54-80. In October 1813, the ambitious Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, assumed the office of the Governor-General, and his first act was to re- examine the border dispute between Nepal and British East India Company. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Nepalese and the British. A struggle with the former was unpromising as the British were ignorant of the country or its resources and, despite their technological superiority, it was a received persuasion that the nature of the mountainous tract, which they would have to penetrate, would be as baffling to them as it had been to all the efforts of many successive Mahomedan sovereigns.Hastings, p. 9. A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. The Nepalese Commissioners had remarked to the British the futility of debating about a few square miles of territory since there never could be real peace between the two States, until the British should yield to the Nepalese all the British provinces north of the Ganges, making that river the boundary between the two, \\"as heaven had evidently designed it to be.\\" However, Nepalese Historian Baburam Acharya contends that the British were striving to annex the hill regions of Nepal and were the ones responsible for creating border disputes. At the border demarcation, the British representative Major Bradshaw disrespected the Nepalese representatives ‚Äì Rajguru Ranganath Poudyal and Kaji Dalabhanjan Pande, with a view of invoking a war against the Nepalese. In the meantime, the British found that the Nepalese were preparing for war; that they had for some time been laying up large stores of saltpetre; purchasing and fabricating arms, and organizing and disciplining their troops under some European deserters in this service, after the model of the companies of East India's sepoy battalions.Anon (1816), p.425. The conviction that the Nepalese raids into the flatlands of the Terai, a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions ‚Äì the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between Calcutta and the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the two powers was \\"necessary and unavoidable\\".Anon (1816), p.426. Britain formally declared war with the Nepal on 1 Nov 1814.Smith, Britain's Declaration of War, p. 187-212. War preparation Bhimsen Thapa, prime minister of Nepal from 1806 to 1837. Pre-war opinions When the Kathmandu Durbar solicited Nepalese chiefs' opinions about a possible war with the British, Amar Singh Thapa was not alone in his opposition, declaring that ‚Äì \\"They will not rest satisfied without establishing their own power and authority, and will unite with the hill rajas, whom we have dispossessed. We have hitherto but hunted deer; if we engage in this war, we must prepare to fight tigers.\\"Prinsep, p. 460. He was against the measures adopted in Butwal and Sheeoraj, which he declared to have originated in the selfish views of persons, who scrupled not to involve the nation in war to gratify their personal avarice.Prinsep, p. 460.Prinsep, p. 79-80. This contrasts sharply with the prime minister of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa ‚Äì \\" ... our hills and fastness are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable.\\"Prinsep, p. 458: The entire letter by Bhimsen Thapa is as follows: \\"Through the influence of your good fortune, and that of your ancestors, no one has yet been able to cope with the state of Nipal. The Chinese once made war upon us, but were reduced to seek peace. How then will the English be able to penetrate into the hills? Under your auspices, we shall by our own exertions be able to oppose to them a force of fifty-two lakhs of men, with which we will expel them. The small fort of Bhurtpoor was the work of man, yet the English being worsted before it, desisted from the attempt to conquer it; our hills and fastnesses are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable. I therefore recommend the prosecution of hostilities. We can make peace afterwards on such terms as may suit our convenience.\\"Hunter, p. 100. This stance by Bhimsen Thapa is not surprising, as insinuated by Amar Singh, considering Amar Singh had made the usurpations in Butwal and Sheoraj, and whose family derived most of the advantages.Prinsep, p. 79-80. Prinsep estimates that the revenue of the usurped lands could not have been less than a lakh of rupees a year to the Nepalese, in the manner they collected it: the retention of this income was therefore an object of no small importance to the ambitious views of Bhimsen Thapa and the preservation of the influence he had contrived to establish for his family.Prinsep, p. 79-80. The Nepalese prime minister realized the Nepalese had several advantages over the British including knowledge of the region and recent experience fighting in the mountainous terrain. However, the British had numerical superiority and far more modern weapons. In the meantime, the Governor-General also naively believed that \\"the difficulties of mountain warfare were greater on the defensive side than on that of a well conducted offensive operation.\\" Soldiers like Rollo Gillespie saw the Nepalese as a challenge to British supremacy ‚Äî \\"Opinion is everything in such a country as India: and whenever the natives shall begin to lose their reverence for the English arms, our superiority in other respects will quickly sink into contempt.\\" Francis Edward Rawdon, Marquess of Hastings, Governor-General of India from 1813 to 1823. Finance The Governor-General looked towards the Nawab of Awadh to finance the impending warfare with Nepal: two crore (20 million) rupees were solicited. Of this matter he writes: > \\"...Saadut AliSaadat Ali Khan II unexpectedly died. I found, however, that > what had been provisionally agitated with him was perfectly understood by > his successor,Ghazi-ud-Din Haider so that the latter came forward with a > spontaneous offer of a crore of rupees, which I declined as a peishcush or > tribute on his accession to the sovereignty of Oude, but accepted as a loan > for the Honourable Company. Eight lacs were afterwards added to this sum, in > order that the interest of the whole, at six per cent, might equal the > allowances to different branches of the Nawab Vizier's family, for which > guarantee of the British Government had been pledged, and the payment of > which, without vexatious retardments, was secured, by the appropriation of > the interest to the specific purpose. The sum thus obtained was thrown into > the general treasury, whence I looked to draw such portions of it as the > demands of the approaching service might require. My surprise is not to be > expressed, when I was shortly after informed from Calcutta, that it had been > deemed expedient to employ fifty four lacs of the sum obtained by me in > discharging an eight per cent loan, that the remainder was indispensable for > current purposes, and it was hoped I should be able to procure from the > Nawab Vizier a further aid for the objects of the war. This took place early > in autumn, and operations against Nepaul could not commence till the middle > of November, on which account the Council did not apprehend my being > subjected to any sudden inconvenience through its disposal of the first sum. > Luckily I was upon such frank terms with the Nawab Vizier, as that I could > explain to him fairly my circumstances. He agreed to furnish another crore; > so that the Honourable Company was accommodated with above two millions and > a half sterling on my simple receipt.\\"Hasting, p. 9-10. In the aftermath of the war, he writes: > \\"The richest portion of the territory conquered by us bordered on the > dominions the Nawab Vizier. I arranged the transfer of that tract to him in > extinction of the second crore which I had borrowed. Of that crore the > charges of the war absorbed fifty two lacs: forty eight lacs (‚Ç§600,000) were > consequently left in the treasury, a clear gain to the Honourable Company, > in addition to the benefit of precluding future annoyance from an insolent > neighbour.\\" This was in contrast with the Nepalese who had spent huge amount of resources on the first and second wars against the Tibetans, which had led to the gradual exhaustion of their treasury. Terrain 1st Foot Guards To the British, who were used to fighting in the plains, but were unacquainted with the terrain of the hills, the formidability of the topology is expressed by one anonymous British soldier as such: > \\"...The territory subject to Nepal consists of a mountainous tract of > country, lying between Tibet and the valley of the Ganges, in breadth not > exceeding one hundred miles, but in length stretching nearly along the whole > extent of the north-west frontier of the British dominions. Below the hills > they held possession of a portion of the plain of irregular width, > distinguished by the name of the Nepal Turrye,Terai but the period at which > the acquisition was made is not ascertained. > > The general military character of the country is that of extreme > difficulty. Immediately at the front of the hills the plain is covered with > the Great Saul Forest,Shorea robusta, also known as sal or shala tree, is a > species of tree belonging to the family Dipterocarpaceae. for an average > width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their > sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle.

The initial British campaign was an attack on two fronts across a frontier of more than , from the Sutlej to the Koshi. In the eastern front, Major-General Bennet Marley and Major-General John Sullivan Wood led their respective columns across the Tarai towards the heart of the valley of Kathmandu. Major-General Rollo Gillespie and Colonel David Ochterlony commanded columns in the western front. These columns were faced with the Nepalese army under the command of Amar Singh Thapa.Anon (1816), p.427. About the beginning of October, 1814, the British troops began to move towards different depots; and the army was soon after formed into four divisions, one at Benares, one at Meeruth, one at Dinapur, and one at Ludhiana. The first division, at Dinapur, being the largest, was commanded by Major-General Marley, and was intended to seize the pass at Makwanpur, between Gunduk and Bagmati, the key to Nepal, and to push forward to Kathmandu: thus at once carrying the war into the heart of the enemy's country.Fraser, p. 13. This force consisted of 8,000 men, including his Majesty's 24th foot of 907 strong; there was a train attached to it of four 18-pounders, eight 6- and 3-pounders, and fourteen mortars and howitzers.Smith, Plan of Operation, p. 215-219.Prinsep, p. 85. The second division, at Benares, under command of Major-General Wood, having subsequently removed to Gorakhpur, was meant to enter the hills by the Bhootnuill pass, and, turning to the eastward, to penetrate the hilly districts, towards Kathmandu, and cooperate with the first division, while its success would have divided the enemy's country and force into two parts, cutting off all the troops in Kumaon and Garhwal from communication with the capital. Its force consisted of his Majesty's 17th foot, 950 strong, and about 3000 infantry, totaling 4,494 men; it had a train of seven 6- and 3-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers. The third division, was formed at Meerut, under Major-General Gillespie; and it was purposed to march directly to the Dehra Dun; and having reduced the forts in that valley, to move, as might be deemed expedient, to the eastward, to recover Srinagar from the troops of Amar Singh Thapa; or to the westward, to gain the post of Nahan, the chief town of Sirmaur, where Ranjore Singh Thapa held the government for his father, Amar Singh; and so sweep on towards the Sutlej, in order to cut off that chief from the rest, and thus to reduce him to terms. This division originally consisted of his Majesty's 53d, which with artillery and a few dismounted dragoons, made up about one thousand Europeans, and two thousand five hundred native infantry, totaling 3,513 men.Prinsep, p. 84. The fourth, or north-western division, at Ludhiana, was to operate in the hilly country lying near the Sutlej: it assembled under Brigadier-General Ochterlony, and was destined to advance against the strong and extensive cluster of posts held by Amar Singh and the troops under his immediate orders at and surrounding Irkee, a considerable town of Kahlur, and to cooperate with the forces under Major-General Gillespie, moving downwards among the hills, when these positions should be forced, surrounding Amar Singh, and driving him upon that army. The force consisted exclusively of native infantry and artillery, and amounted to 5,993 men; it had a train of two 18-pounder, ten 6-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers.Prinsep, p. 83. Lastly, beyond the Koshi River eastward, Major Latter was furnished with two thousand men, including his district battalion, for the defence of the Poornea frontier. This officer was desired to open a communication with the Raja of Sikkim, and to give him every assistance and encouragement to expel the Gorkhas from the eastern hills, short of an actual advance of troops for the purpose. Captain Barr√© Latter was sent to the border with Poornea and after a successful mission to confine the Gorkhas to their own territory concluded the Anglo- Sikkimese Treaty of Titalia confirming the Raja's dominions, although the latter lost territory from his border to the Tamur River. The Commander-in- Chief of the British forces was Lord Moira. All four divisions composed mostly of Indian Sepoys. Ochterlony's army was the only division without a single British battalion. In conclusion, the Gorkhali Army defeated the British on three fronts consisting the middle and the east whereas lost the remaining two fronts in the west. Battle of Makwanpur Gadhi Major General Marley was tasked to occupy Hetauda and capture the fortresses of Hariharpur and Makawanpur before proceeding to Kathmandu. His frontage of advance lay between Rapati river and Bagmati river. After additional reinforcements, he had 12,000 troops for his offensive against the Makawanpur and Hariharpur axis. A big attack base was established but Major General Marley showed reluctance to take risks against the Nepalese. Some skirmishes had already started taking place. Similarly, Major General George Wood, sometimes known as the Tiger of the British Indian Army, proved exceedingly cautious against the hard charging Nepalese. ColonelThe use of English terms for their grades of command was common in the Nepalese army, but the powers of the different ranks did not correspond with those of the British system. The title of General was assumed by Bhimsen Thapa, as Commander-in-chief, and enjoyed by himself alone; of Colonels there were three or four only; all principal officers of the court, commanding more than one battalion. The title of Major was held by the adjutant of a battalion or independent company; and Captain was the next grade to colonel, implying the command of a corps. Luftun, or Lieutenant, was the style of the officers commanding companies under the Captain; and then followed the subaltern ranks of Soobadar, Jemadar, and Havildar, without any Ensigns. (Prinsep, p. 86-87) Ranabir Singh Thapa, brother of Bhimsen Thapa, was to be the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large fortress and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a few pieces of cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya. Battle of Jitgadh With the help of an ousted Palpali king, Major General Wood planned to march on Siuraj, Jit Gadhi and Nuwakot with a view to bypass the Butwal defenses, flushing out minor opposition on the axis, and assault Palpa from a less guarded flank. Nepalese Colonel Ujir Singh Thapa had deployed his 1200 troops in many defensive positions including Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi and Kathe Gadhi. The troops under Colonel Ujir were very disciplined and he himself was a dedicated and able commander. He was famous for exploiting advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. The British advance took place on 22nd Poush1871 BS (January 1814 AD) to Jit Gadh. While they were advancing to this fortress, crossing the Tinau River, the Nepalese troops opened fire from the fortress. Another of the attackers' columns was advancing to capture Tansen Bazar. Here too, Nepalese spoiling attacks forced the General to fall back to Gorakhpur. About 70 Nepalese lost their lives in Nuwakot pakhe Gadhi. Meanwhile, more than 300 of the enemy perished. Battle of Hariharpur Gadhi No special military action had taken place in Hariharpur Gadhi fortress in the first campaign. Major General Bannet Marley and Major General George Wood had not been able to advance for an offensive against Makawanpur and Hariharpur Gadhi fortresses. Battle of Nalapani The Battle of Nalapani was the first battle of Anglo-Nepalese War. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near Dehradun, which was placed under siege by the British between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain Balbhadra Kunwar, while Major-General Rollo Gillespie, who had previously fought at the Battle of Java, was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison, which also consisted of brave women who reportedly shielded the bullets and cannonballs with their bodies, successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month. Fraser recorded the situation in the following terms: After two costly and unsuccessful attempts to seize the fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. The battle set the tone for the rest of the Anglo- Nepalese War, and a number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way. The experience at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his plan of operations as to forego the detachment of a part of this division to occupy Gurhwal.Prinsep, p. 94. He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh's son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan. It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell. In the meantime Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon.Prinsep, p. 95. This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence. Battle of Jaithak Stockaded position of the Nepalese at Jaithak Major General Martindale now joined the force and took over command. He occupied the town of Nahan on 27 December, and started his attack on the fort of Jaithak. The fort had a garrison of 2000 men under the command of Ranajor Singh Thapa, the son of the Amar Singh Thapa. The first assault ended in disaster, with the Nepalese successfully warding off the British offensive. The second managed to cut off the water supply to the fort, but could not capture it mainly because of the exhausted state of the troops and shortage of ammunition. Martindale lost heart and ordered a withdrawal. Jaithak was eventually captured much later in the war, when Ochterlony had taken over the command.Navarne, p. 190. A single day of battle at Jaithak cost the British over three hundred men dead and wounded and cooled Martindell's ardour for battle. For over a month and a half, he refused to take any further initiative against the Nepalese army. Thus by mid-February, of the four British commanders the Nepalese army had faced till that time, Gillespie was dead, Marley had deserted, Wood was harassed into inactivity, and Martindell was practically incapacitated by over-cautiousness. It set the scene for Octorloney to soon show his mettle and change the course of the war. Trying times for Nepalese troops Out West, the Nepalese were hopelessly overextended. Kumaun, a key link in Nepalese army communications with the Far West, was defended by a small force, numbering about seven hundred and fifty men, with an equal number of Kumaoni irregulars, altogether about fifteen hundred men to defend a whole province. In addition, Doti which was to the East of Kumaun, had been practically stripped of troops. Bam Shah, as governor of Kumaun, had final responsibility for the defence of the province. The British force, numbering initially over forty five hundred men, was easily able to outmanoeuvre the Nepalese army defenders and force them to abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey's force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army was unable to stem the tide of the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help. Meanwhile, Hastings sent Colonel Nicolls, Quartermaster-General for the British troops in India, to take charge of the Almora campaign and assigned two thousand regular troops to this front in addition to the very large number of irregulars already assigned to the area ‚Äì all of this against fewer than one thousand Nepalese army soldiers. Hasti Dal Shah and some five hundred Nepalese Army men had set out from Almora to secure Almora's Northern line of communications with Kathmandu. This party was intercepted. Hasti Dal Shah, the ablest Nepalese commander in this sector, was killed in the first moments of the battle. The Nepalese suffered terrible losses. When word of this disaster reached the defenders at Almora, they were stunned. The British closed in on Almora and the Nepalese was unable to prevent the British advance. On April 25, 1815, 2,000 British regulars under Col. Nicholls and a force of irregular troops under Col. Gardiner assaulted and captured the heights of the town of Almorah. Subsequently, the British managed to establish gun positions within seventy yards of the gate of the fort at Almora and the British artillery demolished the walls of the fort at point blank range. Bam Shah surrendered Almora on 27 April 1815. The result of this British victory was the capitulation of the province of Kumaon and all of its fortresses. Second Battle of Malaon and Jaithak The second battle of Malaon and Jaithak cut the Nepalese lines of communication between Central Nepal and the Far West. It also sealed the fate of Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at Malaon and Ranajor Singh Thapa at Jaithak. At Malaon, Major-General Ochterlony had moved with extreme care summoning reinforcements and heavy guns from Delhi until his total attack force consisted of over ten thousand men well-equipped with heavy cannon. Kazi Amar Singh Thapa's position in the Malaon Hills depended on Bilaspur in the lowlands for his food supplies, and the nature of the hills forced him to spread his forces very thinly in an attempt to defend every vantage point. Ochterlony cut off the supply of food from Bilaspur and then turned his attention to the intricate network of defensive posts that were designed to withstand any frontal assault. Although rear fortifications supported these posts, none could withstand a long cannonade by heavy guns. Because Ochterlony had sufficient troops to attack and overwhelm several positions simultaneously, the thinly spread Nepalese defences could be dangerously divided. Ochterlony chose his target, a point on the ridge, and then proceeded to move slowly, consolidating each position that he took, and allowing the pioneers time to build roads so that the heavy guns could be moved forward to support each attack. After a series of carefully planned and executed moves, he succeeded in establishing a position on the crest of Deothal, not even over a thousand yards from Kazi Amar Singh Thapa's main fort at Malaon. The old warrior Bhakti Thapa valiantly led assault after assault on this position, but he died during battle and the position did not fall. Immensely impressed by Bhakti's sustained courage against impossible odds, the British made the well appreciated and honourable gesture of returning his body with full military honours. The British superiority in numbers made it inevitable that they would be able to establish themselves and their heavy guns on a vantage point within range of Ranajor Singh's fortifications, sooner or later. Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa were thus hemmed in and looking down the barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah's letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old commander was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West lost control to the British on 15 May 1815. Second campaign Gorkhali soldiers in 1815. The outstretched Nepalese army was defeated on the Western front i.e. Garhwal and Kumaon area. Ochterlony had finally outfoxed Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. He was the only successful British Commander in the first Nepal-Company campaign. Not surprisingly Lord Moira appointed him as the Main Operational Commander in the second offensive on the Bharatpur-Makawanpur-Hariharpur front with 17,000 strong invasion force, but again, most of them were Indian sepoys. The British had given a 15-day ultimatum to Nepal to ratify a treaty on 28 November. But the points of the treaty were very difficult for the Nepalese to ratify quickly. The delay provided the excuse for the British to commence the second military campaign against the kingdom. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa, another brother of Bhimsen Thapa, had been appointed as Sector Commander for defensive battles for the area from Bijayapur to Sindhuli Gadhi in the first campaign. In this second campaign, Bada Kaji Amarsingh Thapawas detailed as Sector Commander for Sindhuli Gadhi and the eastern front. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa was manning his headquarters at Makwanpur Gadhi. Major General David Ochterlony, was the overall commander against Nepal with a massive 17,000 British troops to assault the fronts including Upardang Gadhi, Sinchyang Gadhi, Kandrang Gadhi, Makawanpur Gadhi and Hariharpur Gadhi. During the campaign in February 1816, Ochterlony decided to take a very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure there would have been a disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow British to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O‚ÄôHollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach Hariharpur Gadhi. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if they were able to get only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade's strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O‚ÄôHollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to Makawanpur by the end of March 1816. The situation became very critical for Nepal and the British which eventually led to a treaty. Major General David Ochterlony settled down to receive the treaty, signed by Kathmandu Durbar through Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya, Pandit Gajaraj Mishra and finally though Bhaktawar Singh Thapa. Two days later the ratified treaty was handed over to the British in Makawanpur. The war ended with the Treaty of Sugauli, which has been considered as an unequal treaty which led to Nepal losing its one-third territory. The river Mechi became the new Eastern border and the Mahakali the Western boundary of Nepal. Aftermath The Treaty of Sugauli Bhimsen Thapa's troops, right, at Segauli, 1816, with India Pattern Brown Bess muskets and chupi bayonets. The Treaty of Sugauli 4 March 1816. It suited Ochterlony to bring the campaign to a speedy conclusion because of the approach of the dreaded aul-fever season but also because a number of his European troops were suffering from dysentery. The Treaty of Sugauli was ratified on 4 March 1816. As per the treaty, Nepal lost all Sikkim (including Darjeeling), the territories of Kumaon and Garhwal and Western Terai. The Mechi River became the new eastern border and the Mahakali river the western boundary of the kingdom. The British East India Company would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region. The British set up Resident.India-Board (8 November 1816) in Kathmandu. The fear of having a British Resident in Kathmandu ultimately proved to be unfounded, as the rulers of Nepal managed to isolate the Resident to such an extent as to be in virtual house arrest. The Terai lands, however, proved difficult for the British to govern and some of them were returned to the kingdom later in 1816 and the annual payments accordingly abolished.Oldfield, p. 304-305. However even after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War, the border issue between the two states was not yet settled. The boundary between Nepal and Oudh was not finally adjusted until 1830; and that between Nepal and the British territories remained as a matter of discussion between the two Governments for several years later.Oldfield, p. 306. The British never had the intention to destroy either the existence or the independence of a state which was usefully interposed between them and the dependencies of China.Anon (1816), p. 428. Lord Hastings had given up his plan to dismember Nepal from fear of antagonising China ‚Äì whose vassal Nepal in theory was. In 1815, while British forces were campaigning in far western Nepal, a high-ranking Manchu official advanced with a large military force from China to Lhasa; and the following year, after the Anglo-Nepalese treaty had been signed, the Chinese army moved south again, right up to Nepal's frontier. The Nepalese panicked, because memories were still vivid of the Chinese invasion of 1792, and there was a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity. Hastings sent mollifying assurances to the imperial authorities, and ordered the British Resident, newly arrived in Kathmandu, to pack his bags and be ready to leave at once if the Chinese invaded again.Pemble, Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War, p.367. Due to the forced treaty under compulsion and duress, experts on international treaty view that Nepal might not have had the capability to recognize the Sugauli as a sound treaty. Cost of war Despite the boast of Lord Moira to the British parliament on having increased the state coffers, the Gurkha War had in reality cost more than the combined cost of the campaigns against the Marathas and the Pindaris for which Lord Moira's administration is better known: Sicca Rs. as against Sicca Rs. .Lamb, p. 41. This was the kind of fact which greatly influenced the policy of the Company government in subsequent years. Thus, while the Company Government, in theory, thoroughly approved of the development of trade, especially in shawl wool, between Western Tibet and its territories, it was unprepared to take any decisive step to bring this about. It preferred to leave the Chinese in Tibet to their own devices, and hoped to avoid the risk, however slight, of another expensive hill war. Furthermore, despite the British merchants' direct access to the wool growing areas after the war, the hopes of shawl wool trade were never realised. The British merchants found that they were too late. The shawl wool market was strictly closed and closely guarded. It was monopolised by traders from Kashmir and Ladakh, and the only outsider with whom they dealt was Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the powerful Sikh ruler of Lahore. Ranjit was very zealous of his privilege, and he was the last person the British could afford to offend at this time of crisis and uncertainty. So the East India Company never did get its shawl wool. When it finally acquired the Punjab and Kashmir, after the Sikh Wars of the 1840s, it had long since given up trade, and Kashmir was so little valued that it was quickly discarded ‚Äì sold for a knock-down price to the Raja of Jammu.Pemble, Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War, p.366-367. Gorkha recruitment Gurkahs of 66th Regiment in their national costume. The Khukuri is the traditional weapon and tool of the Gurkhas. David Ochterlony and the political agent William Fraser were quick to recognize the potential of Nepalese soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Nepalese army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lieutenant Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the 1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles, saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lieutenant Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \\"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\\". About 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not 'real' Gorkhali but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term Gurkha, became the backbone of British Indian forces. As well as Ochterlony's Gorkhali battalions, William Fraser and Lieutenant Frederick Young raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles; an additional battalion, the Kumaon battalion was also raised eventually becoming the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. None of these men fought in the second campaign. Fate of protagonists Bhimsen Thapa Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, with the support of the queen regent Tripura Sundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal. Other ruling families, particularly the Pandes, decried what they saw as Bhimsen Thapa's submissive attitude towards the British. The prime minister however had been able to retain power by maintaining a large, modernized army and politically dominating the court during the minority of King Rajendra Bikram Shah, (reigned 1816‚Äì1847). Additionally, he was able to freeze out the Pandes from power by appointing members of his own family into positions of authority. When queen Tripura Sundari died in 1832, Bhimsen Thapa began to lose influence. In 1833, Brian Hodgson became British resident, openly favouring Bhimsen Thapa's opponents, and in 1837 the king announced his intention to rule independently, depriving the prime minister and his nephew of their military powers. After the eldest son of the queen died, Bhimsen Thapa was falsely accused of attempting to poison the prince. Although acquitted, the Thapas were in turmoil. When the head of the Pande family, Rana Jang Pande, became prime minister, he had Bhimsen Thapa re-imprisoned; Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide in August 1839. David Ochterlony For his part, David Ochterlony received thanks from both Houses of Parliament and became the first officer in the British East India Company to be awarded the GCB. Lord Moira also reinstated him as Resident at Delhi and he lived in the style appropriate to a very senior figure of the Company. However, after Lord Moira left India ‚Äì succeeded by Lord Amherst as Governor-General in 1823 ‚Äì Ochterlony fell out of favor. In 1825 the Raja of Bharatpur died and the six-year-old heir to the throne, whom Ochterlony supported, was usurped by his cousin Durjan Sal. When Durjan Sal failed to submit to Ochterlony's demands to vacate the throne, the British general prepared to march on Bharatpur. He did not receive the backing of the new Governor-General however, and after Amherst countermanded his orders, Ochterlony resigned, as Amherst had anticipated. This episode badly affected the ailing general who died shortly after on 14 July 1825. A 165-foot-high memorial was later erected in Calcutta in his memory; however, Sir David Ochterlony's greatest legacy is the continuing recruitment of Gorkhas into the British and Indian armies. Soon after Ochterlony's resignation Amherst was himself obliged to do what Ochterlony had prepared to do, and laid siege to Bharatpur.

The year of his death (2003), Forbes magazine ranked Yiannis Latsis number 101 on its list of the world's richest people, with a fortune estimated at $5.4 billion.  Biography  Latsis was born in Katakolo ‚Äî a fishing village in the Elis ‚Äî (although his origins are in Epirus), the seventh of 21 children, the son of Spiro Latsis and Aphrodite Efthimiou. He was educated at the Pyrgos School of Commerce and the School for Merchant Navy Captains. He started as a deckhand, eventually working his way up to ship's captain in the merchant marine. After the Second World War, Latsis expanded his activities into coastal shipping with the purchase of used passenger vessels. The most renowned of these vessels was the Neraida (ex Laurana), an Italian-built passenger ship that was routed in the coastal line of the Argo-Saronic Gulf from 1950 to 1974. Today, it is a floating museum dedicated to its owner‚Äôs business history. He bought his first cargo vessel in 1938 and by the 1960s, owned a fleet of ships. In 1955, Latsis purchased a cargo vessel, the Marianna. Three years later, he purchased his first oil tanker, the Spyros, which was used for the transportation of liquid molasses from Egypt to Greece and the UK. In the following years, his fleet expanded significantly, with the acquisition of passenger vessels, cargo ships and oil tankers. In the 1990s, Latsis‚Äô fleet was one of the largest under Greek ownership. In the late 1960s, he diversified his business to include oil ‚Äì establishing Petrola ‚Äî and construction, building (among other things) oil refineries in Greece and Saudi Arabia, before gradually expanding into banking and financial services. In the early 1980s, he made his first investment in the banking sector, with the acquisition of the Banque de D√©p√¥t, a small bank based in Geneva. Banque de D√©p√¥t eventually evolved into EFG International Bank, one of the largest Swiss private banks listed on the Zurich stock exchange. His European Financial Group owns banks in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Monaco, the Channel Islands and Greece. In 1990, he hosted the G7 Economic Conference at Bridgewater House, Westminster, London. He was a close friend of Charles, Prince of Wales, twice loaning him the use of his yacht Alexandros, firstly in 1991 for a second honeymoon with the Princess of Wales, and secondly in 2002 for a cruise with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Others to whom he lent the ship included former President George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell, and Marlon Brando. He also maintained close ties with the Saudi royal family. Latsis donated ¬£5 million to the British Conservative Party during his business career.  Business empire  The Latsis commercial empire has been closely involved with German firm Hochtief in both constructing and managing Spata airport. Through Hellenic Petroleum, one of Greece's largest oil companies ‚Äì in which another partner is the Russian oil giant LUKoil ‚Äì it holds the contract for all fuel supplies to the airport, through an EU-funded pipeline built by a Latsis engineering company. Hellenic Petroleum, according to its own accounts, in 2000, paid $912 million to acquire a 34 percent interest in the Athens Airport Fuel Pipeline Company. A Latsis company also has a 50 percent stake in the huge contract for running most of the airport's \\"ground-handling\\" services ‚Äì almost everything except control of the aircraft themselves. Latsis's development arm, Lamda, is a partner with Hochtief in a series of vast, part-EU funded motorway projects across Greece, as part of the \\"Trans European Network\\". And between 1999 and 2004, during the time when Spata airport was completed, the commission last week revealed that the giant EFG Eurobank Ergasias banking group, controlled by Latsis family interests, held an exclusive contract to handle all EU structural funds coming to Greece, totalling ‚Ç¨28 billion. Also, the private airline business PrivatAir is part of the Latsis Group. Philanthropy His charitable works began with the establishment of the Latsis Scholarships Institute in 1970 and also included the provision of aid to earthquake victims and the creation of the Latsis Foundation. Two years after his passing in 2003, his immediate family founded the John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation in his memory, that undertook the activity of the aforementioned scholarship fund and all the philanthropic work of the family.  Awards  He was awarded the Golden Cross from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix by Greece.  Personal life  Latsis married Erietta Tsoukala. They had three children: Spiros, Marianna and Margarita. Spiros is a trustee of the Friends of Europe, an EU-wide lobbying organisation for greater political integration. His grandson Paris Latsis (son of Marianna) was the former fianc√© of Paris Hilton.  References   External links  John S.

She was named Helena while under construction after the cancellation of the light cruiser . Construction and commissioning Helena was launched at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 28 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John T. Haytin, wife of the mayor of Helena. She was commissioned on 4 September 1945 with Captain Arthur Howard McCollum in command. Service history 1940s Helena completed her outfitting in the Boston, Massachusetts, area and departed on 24 October 1945, arriving New York City the next day to take part in the tremendous celebration of the U.S. Navy's role in World War II victory that marked Navy Day, 27 October 1945. After two shakedown and training periods at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, Helena returned to Boston in February 1946 to prepare for her first deployment, a round-the-world cruise. Helena departed Boston on 12 February 1946 for England, where Admiral H. Kent Hewitt boarded and broke his flag as Commander Naval Forces, Europe, and Commander, 12th Fleet. During the next three months, Helena conducted training exercises in Northern European waters and paid good-will visits to major ports in England and Scotland. Relieved as flagship on 1 May 1946, Helena departed for East Asia via the Suez Canal, calling at major Mediterranean ports; Colombo, Ceylon; and Singapore before arriving at Tsingtao, China, on 18 June 1946. During her tour in East Asia, Helena took part in a wide variety of training exercises and fleet maneuvers until she finally departed Shanghai, China, on 22 March 1947 for the United States after more than a year in foreign waters. After training operations in California waters Helena departed once more for the East Asia on 3 April 1948, arriving at Shanghai 24 days later. Throughout the summer and fall of 1948, she operated primarily in Chinese waters, returning to Long Beach, California, in December 1948. Helena spent much of the spring of 1949 in training a new crew and in May 1949 cruised to train Naval Reservists, returning to Long Beach for a conversion necessary to equip her to carry a helicopter. During July and August 1949, Helena took part in a six-week at-sea training cruise for men of the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps to the Galapagos Islands and Panama. She then took part in Operation Miki, a joint United States Army-U.S. Navy amphibious training exercise in the Hawaiian Islands conducted in November 1949. Helena then proceeded via Yokosuka, Japan, and Hong Kong to the Philippines, where she conducted training exercises. She returned to Japan in January 1950, and soon after experienced the highlights of her service as flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet when the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then touring East Asia, embarked on 2 February 1950. During the remainder of her East Asian tour she carried out a schedule of large-scale fleet exercises off Okinawa and visits to Japanese ports. She departed for the United States on 21 May 1950. 1950s Korean War 8-inch/55-caliber (203-mm) guns at enemy forces ashore on the Korean Peninsula in August 1950 during the Korean War. Helena's schedule called for a summer spent in Long Beach, followed by overhaul at San Francisco. Suddenly came word of the communist aggression in Korea. Hurriedly she prepared for sea; and, on 6 July 1950, sped westward. Stopping at Pearl Harbor only to take on ammunition, she plowed across the Pacific and into action on the east coast of Korea. On 7 August, she first unleashed her guns on an enemy target‚Äîthe railroad marshalling yards, trains, and power plant near Tanchon. Serving as flagship of the Bombardment Task Group, Helena pounded enemy positions, aiding immeasurably in keeping the invaders off balance and preventing them from mounting a formidable drive, as United Nations forces prepared to take the offensive. Operations such as hers provided the diversion necessary to cover the powerful amphibious assault into Inchon, 15 September 1950, Later, Helena provided gunfire support for Korean troops pushing the invaders north along the east coast, and it was Helenas, concentrated firepower that aided in creating a diversion at Samchok, and in the recapture of Pohang. Valuable as she was in Korean waters, Helena could no longer put off overhaul, and in November 1950 she arrived at Long Beach to prepare for the now twice-postponed yard period. After her overhaul, she reported for duty at Sasebo 18 April 1951, and was assigned to Task Force 77, the fast carrier group making daily air strikes against the enemy. While operating as heavy support for the carriers, Helena was often detached to pound shore targets. During June 1951, she was occupied almost continually in interdiction fire at targets along the east coast of Korea, subsequently she returned to the Task Force, At twilight on a day late in July, Helena was straddled and then hit by shore gunfire. Damage was light, and, swiftly twisting around the harbor in the maneuver which came to be called \\"the war dance\\", Helena delivered rapid continuous fire that destroyed seven enemy gun positions and an ammunition dump. After a short respite at Yokosuka, she returned again to the Task Force, but was soon detached for special duty supporting a massive air strike on supply depots and rail road marshalling yards at Rashin, acting as radar picket. Helena's accurate gunnery was next sought by the Eighth Army, for whom she fired at 13 targets along the bombline in aid of advancing infantry. Her support to ground forces continued with missions fired for United States Marines and Republic of Korea Army units. On 20 September 1951 she returned to Yokosuka. Here, at a ceremony on her decks, President Syngman Rhee of Korea presented to Task Force 95 the first Korean Presidential Unit Citation awarded to a naval unit. Helena received the award for her operations in the fall of 1950. After rejoining the Task Force, Helena was ordered to duty as fire support vessel in the Hungnam-Hamhung area. With her helicopter providing its usual efficient spotting, she fired with great success on rail and highway bridges, marshalling yards and gun positions for the next 2 weeks. Helena returned to Long Beach 8 December 1951 and her entire battery of nine guns was replaced. In February, she commenced training for return to the Far East. One of the highlights of this training period came from 14 February to 23 February 1952 when she took part in \\"Lex Baker One\\", the largest scale training exercise held since the outbreak of the Korean War. Over 70 ships and 15,000 sailors and Marines took active part in this operation. Helena arrived once again at Yokosuka 8 June 1952 and the next day was underway to rendezvous with Task Force 77 off the coast of Korea. For 5 months her mission again was to burn buildings, destroy gun positions, and smash transportation facilities; all were left in her wake after shore bombardments. She also performed air rescue of pilots, two of whom were deep in enemy territory. On 24 November 1952, Helena was relieved of her normal duties at Yokosuka and 5 days later sailed on a special mission. She called first at Iwo Jima where on 1 December Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander In Chief Pacific Fleet, boarded the ship by helicopter to visit briefly. Two days later she proceeded to Guam, where President-Elect Dwight D. Eisenhower, with several of his prospective cabinet members, and Admiral Radford embarked for passage to Pearl Harbor. Top-level policy conferences were held on board. Helena's distinguished passengers disembarked at Pearl Harbor 11 December 1952, and she returned to Long Beach 16 December. Post-Korean War Helena departed for the Far East on 4 August 1953 to join Task Force 77 on security patrol in the Sea of Japan and after another voyage to the United States for upkeep and training, rejoined the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka as flagship on 11 October 1954. Helena spent much of her time in waters off Taiwan. The highlights of Helenas service during this tour of duty came in February 1955 during the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. These off-shore islands posed a possible point of contention between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese; and it was determined to neutralize them by means of evacuation. On 6 February came the \\"execute\\" from President Eisenhower, and the fleet, led by Helena, got underway. By 1500 on 9 February 1955, with Helena on watchful patrol, all civilians had been removed to safety from the islands‚Äîa total of 18,000 people. Early on 12 February the remaining 20,000 Nationalist troops were removed and, as Helena steamed on rear guard patrol, the Task Force sailed south. After 6 months' training in home waters, Helena again sailed for Yokosuka, arriving 25 January 1956. During the 6 months of this tour of duty, she once more operated primarily in the Taiwan area and briefly in Philippine waters on exercises. She returned to Long Beach 8 July. While there alterations were performed replacing her fore and aft masts and enclosing her navigation and flag bridges. Exercises, which included firing of the Regulus I missile from Helenas launching gear, continued for 9 months, and then she headed for another Far East tour 10 April 1957. During the ensuing tour of duty, she played her flagship role fully, combining sea power and diplomacy. Helena returned to Long Beach 19 October. Following a major overhaul completed 31 March 1958 and intensive training, including missile launching, she again sailed west. Helenas 1958 cruise in the Far East began 3 August. Her first port of call was Keelung, Taiwan, arriving 21 August. On the next day, students and faculty of the Taiwan National Defense College were received on board for a tour of the ship. Her schedule next called for a visit to Manila, but the crisis brought on by the Chinese Communist shelling of the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu governed by the Nationalists interrupted normal operations. During the next weeks, Helena patrolled the troubled area. On 7 September she steamed to within of the Chinese mainland, covering Chinese Nationalist supply ships replenishing Quemoy Island. While on this duty, she was illustrating once more the fact that the mere presence of the overwhelming naval strength of the United States is one of the most formidable protections the free world has in deterring such aggression. On 9 October 1958, while off the Philippines, word flashed to Helena to proceed to the aid of a stricken merchant vessel of Norwegian registry, the Hoi Wong, which had run aground on Bombay Reef in the Paracel Islands. Helena reached the scene at 1000, 10 October 1958. Her helicopters rescued men, women and children, whom she transported to Hong Kong. Her men had skillfully and courageously carried out a difficult humanitarian mission, another contribution to strengthening American relationships with Asian nations. Helena resumed patrol and readiness operations until her return to Long Beach 17 February 1959. 1960s On 5 January 1960 Helena departed for the Western Pacific in company with Yorktown and her escort of Destroyer Squadron 23\\\\. Visits to Korea and to Taiwan prefaced her participation in Operation Blue Star, one of the largest peacetime amphibious exercises in our history. After a period in Japan, Helena sailed with Ranger and Saint Paul to Guam. On 24 April 1960, Helena, in company with destroyers Taylor and Jenkins, set sail for Australia. She then returned to Long Beach and from June until November underwent extensive overhaul. In mid-January 1961 she became the permanent flagship of Commander, 1st Fleet. On 17 May 1961, led by the Helena, 12 1st Fleet ships put on a firepower demonstration for more than 700 members of the American Ordnance Association. In June, Helena, with eight guests of the Secretary of the Navy on board, cruised to Portland, Oregon, for the Rose Festival. During the next months, Helena joined in Exercise Tail Wind, rendezvousing with the cruiser Los Angeles, the guided missile frigate Coontz and their destroyer escort to form the largest \\"Fleet Sail\\" in 4 years. Helena visited major ports of the Far East, rode out Typhoon Olga off Hong Kong, then returned to San Diego 6 October, soon to participate in Exercise Covered Wagon. During the remainder of the year, Helena participated in a major fleet demonstration observed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral George W. Anderson. Her last operation of the year was Exercise \\"Black Bear.\\" During 1961 and 1962, Helena, operated in United States West Coast and western Pacific waters, taking part in several amphibious operations with ships of the 1st Fleet and elements of the 1st Marine Division and 3rd Marine Air Wing. Helena embarked foreign and staff officers from the Naval War College March 1962, and two groups of Navy League members engaged in orientation cruises in June and August. As 1962 ended, Helena was scheduled for inactivation at Long Beach Naval Shipyard. On 18 March 1963, Commander 1st Fleet shifted his flag to Saint Paul. Decommissioning and disposal Helena was placed out of commission in Reserve 29 June 1963, after serving (just two months shy of) 18 continuous years of service. Helena was transferred on 30 June 1963 to San Diego Group Pacific Reserve Fleet. Stricken on 1 January 1974, and sold to Levin Metals Co., San Jose, Calif., on 13 November 1974, and scrapped in Richmond, Calif the following year. Honors and awards For her service in the Korean War, Helena was presented the Presidential Unit Citation of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Service Medal with four stars. Legacy Helenas ship's bell, her anchor chain, and one of her propellers are located in downtown Helena, Montana, on the grounds of the Walking Mall, outside the Lewis & Clark County Library. Boilers from the Helena continue to be used in the ArcJet Complex at NASA Ames Research Center to operate a large steam injection vacuum pump system.

His father emigrated to Canada in 1909, settling in Taber, Alberta. Career Jayne Mansfield with jockeys Johhny Longden, Eddie Arcaro and Willie Shoemaker (left to right) in 1957 By 1912, Longden Sr. had saved enough money to send for his wife and young son to join him in Canada. However, the Longdens' train was late getting to the port of Southampton, and they missed their scheduled voyage to New York City on the Titanic.Many racing historians have questioned the Titanic fact as it has never been proved. Longden may have just been told this and believed it to be true. As a young man, Longden Jr. worked in the mining industry. His love of horses and horse-racing led him to leave Canada in 1927 to seek opportunities as a jockey in California's burgeoning racing scene. Based at Santa Anita Park, by 1956 he had become thoroughbred racing's winningest rider, breaking the record of 4,870 wins by British jockey Sir Gordon Richards (1904‚Äì1988). Longden, who was called \\"The Pumper\\" by his fellow jockeys because of his riding style, rode many of the great thoroughbreds of the day. In 1943, he captured the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes aboard Count Fleet. A sculptured bust of Longden, along with busts of fellow jockeys William Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay, has been placed in the paddock area at Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia, California. A founding member of the Jockeys' Guild in 1940, Longden was the United States' leading jockey in races won in 1938, 1947, and 1948. He was also the leading jockey in purses won in 1943 and 1945. He was voted the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1952. In 1958, Longden was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He retired the following year as the jockey with the most wins in racing history with 6,032 victories from his 32,413 mounts. His last ride was in the 1966 San Juan Capistrano Handicap at Santa Anita Park, which he won aboard George Royal in a stretch duel. The clubhouse at Santa Anita Park contains an oil painting of the finish of this race. The image was used for the cover of the Santa Anita official program during the 1967 racing season. Horse ownership and training career Longden operated a racing stable under the name Alberta Ranches Ltd. in partnership with Frank McMahon, Wilder H. Ripley and Max Bell, longtime friends from Alberta. On January 28, 1971, Longden's wife Hazel became the first woman to train a stakes winner at Santa Anita Park when her horse Diplomatic Agent won the San Vicente Stakes. Longden's sons Eric and Vance Longden both became horse trainers. Following his retirement from riding, Longden turned to training and became the only person to ever win the Kentucky Derby as both a jockey and trainer when he captured the 1969 Derby with Frank McMahon's colt Majestic Prince. Longden was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame on its formation in 1976. He went on to become the second ever recipient of the Avelino Gomez Memorial Award in 1985, given annually to jockeys who have made significant contributions to the sport. In 1994, he was recognized further by the North American racing industry with a Special Eclipse Award. Harness racing The June 12, 1954 issue of the Daily Racing Form reported that Johnny Longden was also an owner of a Standardbred racehorse which he personally drove to victory in a race at Sportsman's Park in Phoenix, Arizona. Television appearance In 1957, Johnny Longden and his wife Hazel Longden, both appeared briefly as themselves on the legendary sit-com, I Love Lucy. In the episode, \\"Lucy and the Loving Cup\\" (Season 6 Episode 12), Longden was set to receive a trophy for being the winningest jockey in history at an awards dinner at the Babal√∫ nightclub run by Ricky Ricardo. Early in the episode, Ricky makes fun of Lucy's new hat, so she puts the trophy over her head as a joke, but it ends up stuck on her head; after many failed attempts to remove it, she is forced to comically make her way through the New York City subway system to get the trophy to the club in time for the ceremony. After a run-in with an elderly lady, a homeless man and a cop, Lucy finally makes it to the nightclub and the trophy (with Lucy's head still stuck inside) is presented to a very confused Johnny Longden. Longden thanks Ricky for the trophy but asks what he should do about Ricky's wife. Ricky replies that Lucy has been his problem for 15 years, so now Johnny can deal with her. Last years/legacy As of 2006, Longden still holds five track records at Santa Anita Park. Longden was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Famous Mormon in Rodeo and Horseracing Longden died on his 96th birthday on St. Valentine's Day at his home in Banning, California.

Service history Mediterranean, 1946-1949 Juneau spent her first year of commissioned service in operations along the Atlantic seaboard and Caribbean. Prior to the Korean War, she deployed three times in the Mediterranean. The ship cleared New York on 16 April 1947, and joined the 6th Fleet at Trieste on 2 May where she aided in stabilizing the unresolved question of territorial ownership between Italy and Yugoslavia. During an extended tour of Greece, she provided ample warning to the communists that aggression would not go unchallenged. The ship returned to Norfolk on 15 November for training, and was back on duty with the 6th Fleet from 14 June-3 October 1948 and again from 3 May-26 September 1949. As on her first cruise, she ranged the Mediterranean to assure Europeans and Africans of our intention to guard world peace and freedom. Having been reclassified CLAA-119 on 18 March 1949, Juneau departed Norfolk on 29 November for the Pacific. Korean War, 1950-1952 She arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 15 January 1950 and took part in operations along the Pacific coast. On 22 April, she became flagship for Rear Admiral J. M. Higgins, Commander Cruiser Division 5 (CruDiv 5), and reported for duty in Yokosuka, Japan on 1 June, where she began surveillance patrols in the Tsushima Straits. When the Korean War broke out on 25 June, Juneau was one of the few ships immediately available to Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander of Naval Forces, Far East. She patrolled south of the 38th parallel to prevent enemy landings, conducted the first shore bombardments on 29 June at Bokuko Ko, destroyed enemy shore installations, engaged in the first naval action on 2 July when she sank three enemy torpedo boats near Chumonchin Chan, and supported raiding parties along the coast. On 18 July, Juneaus force, which included British units such as the Royal Navy light cruiser , laid down a deadly barrage on enemy troop concentrations near Yongdok which slowed down the North Korean advance southward. The ship departed Sasebo Harbor on 28 July and made a sweep through the Formosa Straits before reporting for duty with the 7th Fleet at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 2 August. She became flagship of the Formosa Patrol Force on 4 August, remaining until 29 October when she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force operating off the east coast of Korea. The ship conducted daily plane guard for the attack carriers, and returned to Long Beach, California, on 1 May 1951 for overhaul. In nine months she was updated with improved Mk 37, 56 and 63 fire control and an improved armament of 14 3-inch/50cal (6x2 & 2x1) and 12 5-inch (6x2).

It is tall and has 23 floors. The postal address is No. 1, Undershaft, though the main entrance fronts onto Leadenhall Street, in the City of London financial district. The building was designed by the Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership in the international style: the stark rectilinear geometry and detailing of the building was influenced by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and is somewhat reminiscent of his Seagram Building in New York City. It was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction as one of only four high-rise buildings in London using a top-down engineering design where the lower office floors are suspended from above rather than supported from below. In 1992, the building was heavily damaged in the Baltic Exchange bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA, as a result of which it was substantially renovated. The building was sold in 2003 by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to property developer Simon Halabi. In 2007, it was reported that Halabi was considering plans to demolish the building and replace it with a much taller tower, but this plan was not fulfilled. In 2011, it was reported that the building had been sold to an undisclosed Far Eastern private investor for ¬£288 million. Plans for the site submitted in February 2016 feature a 310 m-tall 72-floor tower largely given to office space. In November 2016, planning permission was granted for the Trellis Tower, which will house up to 10,000 workers and which, upon completion, will be the tallest building in the City of London and the second tallest building in the UK, after The Shard.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/trellis-1-undershaft- skyscraper-london-green-light-building History Design and development In 1961, the Commercial Union Assurance Company had acquired a site in St Mary Axe, in the City of London, which it desired to develop as its new headquarters. The site comprised adjacent properties in St Mary Axe and the former Shell building in Great St Helens. At the same time the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was planning to redevelop its city offices in Leadenhall Street. Due to a number of issues affecting both sites, notably poor access to the Commercial Union site and the restricted width of the Peninsular and Oriental site, it was not possible to obtain planning consents that would optimise the amount of floor space desired by either company. As a result, the two companies decided to participate in a joint development that would involve the reallocation of site boundaries and the creation of an open concourse area at the junction of Leadenhall Street and St Mary Axe. Both companies were to have frontages on the new concourse and would retain site areas equivalent to those enclosed by the original boundaries. The architect for the project was the Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership, who acknowledged the influence of Mies van der Rohe. The design was an elongated cube in the modernist international style. The original cladding (apart from the windows) was anodidized aluminium, whose colour changed in varying lighting conditions from dark grey to dark bronze. The tower has 24 usable office floors. In addition there are two double-height plant floors; the boiler rooms on one of the plant floors also serviced the neighbouring Peninsular and Oriental building. The floor-to-site-area ratio is 5.5:1. There were five underground levels, providing the staff restaurant, garage and three levels of storerooms and strongrooms. Below the lowest office floor, the design was broken by an open podium which was designed to provide elevated pedestrian access via the City of London Pedway Scheme. Pedway was an ambitious but ultimately unfulfilled scheme to improve traffic flow in the City of London by means of the construction of a network of elevated pedestrian walkways. From the mid-1960s to the 1980s, developers of major sites were required to provide access to the Pedway network as a condition of obtaining planning consent. The requirement was unpopular with designers, who regarded the results as visually unappealing unused space that often provided pedestrians with dead ends. In the case of this development, a podium-level walkway was constructed that linked the Commercial Union building with its neighbour, the Peninsular and Oriental building. Construction The Commercial Union building under construction in 1968. Office floors were suspended from steel trusses cantilevered from the mid- and roof-level plant floors The construction of the Commercial Union building was undertaken by Taylor Woodrow Construction. The structure comprises a central concrete service core, surrounded by a steel framework suspended from projecting steel truss sections at the mid- and roof-level plant floors. The office floors are suspended from these steel frameworks; the roof section supports twelve floors while the midsection supports thirteen floors. The steel hangers are installed in alternate window mullions and vary in size: 0.23 m √ó 0.05‚Äì0.23 m. This suspended construction design was aimed at maximising floor space by largely eliminating the need for support columns. The new piazza in front of the two new buildings was below street level, and steps were constructed on two sides. Air intake louvres for ventilating the building's five sub-surface levels were built into the treads of the steps. The piazza was planted with semi-mature lime trees. Awards In 1970, the Commercial Union and Peninsular & Oriental buildings won the Civic Trust Award for townscape and design co- ordination. In the same year the Commercial Union building was awarded the Structural Steel Design Special Award, sponsored by the British Steel Corporation and the British Constructional Steelwork Association.

This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian Subcontinent, ranging across most of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and western Myanmar. It is a common bird in urban gardens and farmland in many parts of India and its small size, distinctive colours and upright tail make it easy to identify. The northern populations have a rufous rump and back and have a distinct breeding and non-breeding plumage while other populations lack such variation. Description P. s. stewartii with supercilium visible (Haryana, India) These 13‚Äì14 cm long warblers have short rounded wings and longish graduated cream tail tipped with black subterminal spots. The tail is usually held upright and the strong legs are used for clambering about and hopping on the ground. They have a short black bill. The crown is grey and the underparts are rufous in most plumages. In breeding plumage, adults of the northern population are ash grey above, with a black crown and cheek with no supercilium and coppery brown wings. In non-breeding season, this population has a short and narrow white supercilium and the tail is longer. They are found singly or in pairs in shrubbery and will often visit the ground. In winter, the northern subspecies, P. s. stewartii Blyth, 1847, has warm brown upperparts and a longer tail and has seasonal variation in plumage. The other races retain summer plumage all year round. West Bengal and eastwards has race inglisi Whistler & Kinnear, 1933 which is darker slaty above than the nominate race of the Peninsula and deeper rufous on the flanks with a finer and shorter beak. The distinctive endemic race in Sri Lanka, P. s. brevicauda Legge, 1879, has a shorter tail and has the juveniles with yellowish underparts apart from a distinct call. Distribution and habitat This passerine bird is found in dry open grassland, open woodland, scrub and in home gardens in many cities. The northern limits of the species are along the Himalayan foothills extending into the upper Indus river system. The species is absent from the dry desert zone of the west of India and extends east into Burma. The Sri Lankan population is found mainly in the lowlands but going up into the hills to about 1600 m. Behaviour and ecology Like most warblers, the ashy prinia is insectivorous. The song is a repetitive ' or '. Another call is a nasal '. It also makes a sound like \\"electric sparks\\" during its fluttery flight, which is thought to be produced by the wings (however, one author suggests that it is made by the beak). Calls with the \\"spark\\" sounds at end The non-migratory genus Prinia shows biannual moult, which is rare among passerines. A moult occurs in spring (April to May) and another moult occurs in autumn (October to November). Biannual moult is theorized to be favoured when ectoparasite loads are very high, however no investigations have been made. Prinia socialis moults some remiges twice a year and is termed to have a partially biannual moult, however some authors describe P. socialis socialis as having two complete moults. Birds stay in pairs but roost singly on the branch of a small tree or shrub. Breeding The song is sung from the top of a bush and males make fluttery display flights with the tail held up. The ashy prinia builds its nest close to the ground in a shrub or tall grass. Several types of nests have been described, including a flimsy cup made by sewing several large leaves, an oblong purse-like structure with grass stems inside it, and a flimsy ball of grass. The usual nest is built low in a bush and consists of leaves stitched together with webs, lined with hair and having an entrance on the side. It lays 3 to 5 glossy, somewhat oval-shaped eggs. They vary in colour from brick-red to rich chestnut. The broad end of the egg is generally darker than the remainder of the shell, and exhibits a cap or zone. The eggs measure 0.6 to 0.68 inches in length, and 0.45 to 0.5 in breadth. They hatch in about 12 days. The breeding season varies with locality and has been recorded around the year, but mostly after the monsoons. In north India it is mainly June to September and in Sri Lanka mainly December to March or August to October. Breeding season is during May to June in the Nilgiris. The species is believed to be monogamous, and both the male and the female take part in incubation and feeding, though to varying extents. Parents may spend more time at the nest during cool days. The eggs hatch in about 12 days. Plaintive and grey-bellied cuckoos are known to be brood parasites of this species. When the nest is threatened by predators such as cats, adults have been observed feigning injury. Rare cases of birds reusing material from a nest to build a nest at a new location have been noted.

She was the first US Navy ship to be named for Little Rock, Arkansas. Commissioned in mid-1945, she was completed too late to see combat duty during World War II. After an initial South American cruise, she spent the next few years serving off the east coast of the U.S., in the Caribbean, and in the Mediterranean. Like all but one of her sister ships, she was retired in the post-war defense cutbacks, becoming part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in 1949. In the late 1950s she was converted to a guided missile cruiser, which involved removing all her aft six-inch and five-inch guns and rebuilding her aft superstructure to accommodate the Talos missile system. Also, like three other of her sister Cleveland ships converted to missile ships, she was also extensively modified forward to become a flagship. This involved removal of most of her forward armament to allow for a greatly enlarged superstructure. She was recommissioned in 1960 as CLG-4 (and in 1975 redesignated CG-4). In her new career she served extensively in the Mediterranean, often as the Sixth Fleet flagship. She decommissioned for the last time in 1976 (after 20 years and 4 months of commissioned service), and is now a museum ship at Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park. Little Rock is the sole surviving member of the Cleveland class. Construction and Commissioning Little Rock was laid down by William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, 6 March 1943; launched 27 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Sam Wassell; and commissioned 17 June 1945, Capt. William E. Miller in command. Service history 1945-1949 After shakedown off Cuba and training along the Atlantic coast, Little Rock departed Newport, R.I., 21 October for South America. Following this five-month cruise to Latin countries, the cruiser returned Norfolk 23 March 1946. For the next two months she performed exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean, before sailing for Europe 4 June. After operating with the 6th Fleet throughout the summer. Little Rock returned Norfolk 27 September 1946. From November 21‚Äì27, 1946, was en route to Davis Strait as part of Task Group 20.2, which also included the cruiser Little Rock and destroyer .USS Missouri Association Between November 27 and December 4, she participated in cold weather exercises in Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, as part of Task Group 20.2. An incident during that cruise involving Little Rock. She was off the port side firing 5-inch star shells for illumination, to spot icebergs, when there was a misfire. According to standard procedure the gunner began to point the barrel toward the water to wait out a hangfire. However, the round cooked off halfway down. The round hit Missouri on the signal bridge, killing Coxswain Robert Fountain and starting a fire involving an acetylene tank which was lashed to the railing. One or two officers' cabins were destroyed as well. Missouri did not get back to Norfolk until December 13, 1946. From September 1946 to 1949, Little Rock performed east coast exercises; operated in the Caribbean on training maneuvers; and sailed to the Mediterranean during 1947 and 1948. Little Rock decommissioned 24 June 1949 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New York. Converted to guided missile cruiser Reclassified CLG-4 on 23 May 1957, Little Rock began a major conversion to a guided missile light cruiser of the . This refit included replacing the aft six-inch turrets with a Talos missile battery. She recommissioned at Philadelphia 3 June 1960, Capt. J. O. Phillips in command. The cruiser performed shakedown training in the Caribbean, test-firing her Talos missiles to prepare to join the Navy's rapidly expanding fleet of ships armed with guided missiles capable of delivering a nuclear punch. 1961-1976 Departing Philadelphia 9 February 1961, Little Rock sailed for her first European cruise in her new role. After six months operating with the 6th Fleet and NATO units, the guided-missile cruiser returned to Norfolk during September. While operating in the Caribbean, 18 November 1961, Little Rock was ordered to the waters off Santo Domingo to provide an element of stability during the uncertainty and unrest which plagued that country as rival factions vied to fill the political vacuum created by the assassination of Rafael Trujillo. For the next four years Little Rock annually sailed to the Mediterranean, joining the 6th Fleet. She relieved , as Sixth Fleet flagship from May to December 1963 as she maintained the peace in southern Europe and the Middle East. During the months between deployments to the Mediterranean, she operated off the east coast, in the Caribbean, and off northern Europe with units of NATO countries, remaining on the east coast during 1966 for overhaul and refresher training. In 1967 she relieved the USS Springfield as the Sixth Fleet flagship at Rota Spain and proceeded to her new home port at Gaeta, Italy. While away from Gaeta, she participated in exercises in the Mediterranean and carried the admiral to foreign ports. In 1967 the Six Day War broke out and she steamed to the eastern Mediterranean as command ship for NATO vessels in the area. When Israeli forces attacked the , Little Rock went to her aid and was the second ship to arrive. She provided zone security and medical assistance to injured crew members of Liberty. During an exercise in mid-1970, she collided with Greek destroyer Lonchi (D56), damaging her bow. The bow was temporarily repaired at Malta. In September, she returned to the United States and underwent a major overhaul in the Boston Naval Shipyard from November 1970 to the spring of 1971. After refresher training, she returned to duty as flagship of the Sixth Fleet. Between 1970 and 1972, Raymond Edwin \\"Ray\\" Mabus, Jr. served aboard the Little Rock as a surface warfare officer. In 2009, Mabus was appointed as the seventy-fifth Secretary of the Navy, serving in the Obama administration. On 5 June 1975 Little Rock participated in the ceremonies marking the reopening of the Suez Canal. Third in line in the parade of ships she transited the northern part of the Canal from Port Said to Isma√Ølia. After the transit, Little Rock made a port visit to Alexandria, Egypt. Leaving Alexandria, she crossed the Mediterranean and visited Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. In the spring of 1976 the Talos SAM system was deactivated US Navy-wide, and Little Rock was no exception. While plans and funding were made for an extensive overhaul, modernization, and new weapons fit, a boiler room casualty occurred during the summer of 1976 while she was cruising in the Mediterranean. A field survey revealed the ship's propulsion system was in a significantly dire material condition and would require extensive and expensive overhauls and repairs. Given the ships age, only minimal repairs were made to allow the ship to transit back to Norfolk, VA. Further survey inspections were made; however, the ship was decommissioned in the fall of 1976.https://www.navysite.de/cg/clg4.htm A year later the ship was towed via the Saint Lawrence Seaway to Buffalo, NY, where she resides as a museum ship. Museum ship After her decommissioning, Little Rock was taken to Buffalo, New York, where she is open to public touring at the Buffalo Naval & Military Park. While serving as a museum ship, the Little Rock was present alongside the commissioning of the newer USS Little Rock (LCS-9) on 16 December 2017. The commissioning ceremony marked the first time a U.S. Navy ship has commissioned next to her namesake.

EM was developed because OO gauge, favoured by manufacturers of British prototype models, utilised track that was too narrow. OO was developed in the UK in the 1930s as a response to manufacturers finding they were unable to fit the motors of the time into British prototype small boilered locomotives when scaled at the globally popular HO scale's 3.5 mm to a foot (1:87). As the scale was increased to 4 mm to the foot to make the locomotives larger, the track gauge was left at , and hence is too narrow (by a scale ) to correctly depict the prototype's track gauge of . EM gauge was founded in the 1950s, originally with gauge track and rolling stock wheelsets based upon the crude and massively out-of-scale products of the contemporary OO model manufacturers. 18mm gauge was still undersize by almost a millimetre. With the limitations of modelling at this time, particularly the width of tyres, the largest gauge that could fit within the outline of a scale model would be 18.5 mm, no larger. This was mostly an issue for steam locomotives, where the popular technique at the time of making connecting and coupling rods from rail required an excessive spacing between wheel faces and the cylinders. Attempts to make finer tyre and flange standards were thwarted initially by the overscale rail sections available commercially, it being impractical for an individual modeller to make smaller rails ‚Äì although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail. Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the wheel centres. More critically, small flanges required comparably smaller rail, trackwork gaps and point frogs in order to work reliably. Wheelset standards did become more fine in time, allowing EM to evolve into gauge track (for a while called EEM gauge until it was adopted into the mainstream standard). Some modellers were still not happy with this, it is still a scale too narrow, and developed the P4 standards ( gauge). Most EM modellers will have started off using OO gauge and having acquired the necessary modelling skills, then advanced into EM. Modellers in EM typically re-wheel their rolling stock and hand-build their trackwork, although pre-built track is available from specialist suppliers. There are also many 4 mm scale kits which can be used by all 4 mm scale gauges, and since the advanced skills, advanced kitbuilding and scratchbuilding are also common. EM standards are set by the EM Gauge Society, defining gauge and wheel dimensions to ensure compatibility across layouts.

Her impresario was Bruno Coquatrix. Early career She was born as √âmilienne-Henriette Boyer in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. Her melodious voice gave her the chance, while working as a part-time model, to sing in the cabarets of Montparnasse. An office position at a prominent Parisian theater opened the door for her and within a few years she was cast as Lucienne Boyer, singing in the major Parisian music halls. Popular success In 1927, Boyer sang at a concert by the great star F√©lix Mayol where she was seen by the American impresario Lee Shubert who immediately offered her a contract to come to Broadway. Boyer spent nine months in New York City, returning to perform there and to South America numerous times throughout the 1930s. By 1933 she had made a large number of recordings for Columbia Records of France including her signature song, \\"Parlez-moi d'amour\\". Written by Jean Lenoir, the song won the first-ever Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy. Personal life Boyer lost her soldier father in World War I and had to go to work in a munitions factory to help her family get by. In 1939, she married the cabaret singer Jacques Pills of the very popular duo Pills et Tabet. Their daughter Jacqueline, born on 23 April 1941, followed in their footsteps, becoming a very successful singer who won the 1960 Eurovision Song Contest. Throughout World War II, Boyer continued to perform in France, but for her Jewish husband, it was a very difficult time. Following the Allied Forces liberation of France, her cabaret career flourished and for another thirty years, she maintained a loyal following. At the age of 73, she sang with her daughter at the famous Paris Olympia and appeared on several French television shows. Death She died in Paris, and was interred in the Cimeti√®re de Bagneux in Montrouge, near Paris.

The Empress State Building is a high rise building on the West Brompton/Earl's Court border in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (West London). Its full address is Empress State Building, Empress Approach, Lillie Road, West Brompton, London, SW6 1TR. History The building is named after the Empress Hall which formerly stood on the site, and in tribute to the Empire State Building. It was built between 1958 and 1961 on the site of the former Empress Hall and ice rink as a commercial building and was tall with 28 floors, designed by Stone, Toms & Partners and was briefly the tallest commercial building in London until Millbank Tower was built in 1962. It was renovated in 2003 to a design by Wilkinson Eyre Architects. Three floors and were added to its height. 'Orbit' is the name given to the private revolving bar on the top floor which offers panoramic views of London. This building was originally designed as a hotel but was first used by the Admiralty and GCHQ. The Directorate of Naval Shore Telecommunications (formerly the Naval Shore Telecommunications Authority) had their national headquarters in the building in the 1980s and 90s.  Metropolitan Police offices  The building is occupied by staff from the Metropolitan Police Service who refer to it as ESB. Among other things, the building is home to the assessment centre for prospective police officers. Some of the upper floors were occupied by staff from Transport for London until 2010. An annexe at the entrance to the site housed the Metropolitan Police Heritage Centre until January 2020. In March 2018 the London mayor's office agreed to buy the ESB estate for its MPS operations from Capco Plc, the developer of the adjacent Earl's Court regeneration scheme, for ¬£250 million.

For historical reasons almost all manufacturers of British prototype models use 00 gauge (1:76.2 models running on gauge track). There several finescale standards which have been developed to enable more accurate models than 00, and P4 is the most accurate in common use. The P4 standards specify a scale model track gauge of for standard gauge railways. Joe Brook Smith was the first to propose use of an exact scale track gauge in July 1964, when also the term ‚ÄúProtofour‚Äù was invented by Malcolm Cross. The standards were later published in Model Railway News by the Model Railway Study Group in August 1966. Just as in the prototype railway, on a model the wheel-rail interface is the fundamental aspect of reliable operation. So as well as a track gauge, P4 also specifies the wheel profile and track parameters to use, which are largely a scaled-down version of real-life standards with some allowances for practical manufacturing tolerances. P4 standards have been extended to several other prototypes. Broader than standard gauges have been modelled using P4 standards, including Brunel's gauge, modelled with track and Irish P4, the Irish broad gauge modelled in P4 in 4 mm scale with gauge track.Steve Johnson's Irish P4 Models Several successful models of narrow gauge prototypes with a correspondingly accurate track gauges have also been produced to P4 standards. P4 standards are promoted worldwide by the Scalefour Society, which is based in the United Kingdom. The EM Gauge Society also provides support for modelling to P4 standards: many P4 modellers belong to both societies. The standards document is hosted by the Scalefour Society and the society's Central London Area Group (CLAG) make a HTML version available.  S4 Standard  The S4 Standard is maintained as part of the P4 standards. The S4 Standard removes an allowance in the P4 standards for the tight (compared to the prototype) curves used on model railways. The wheel back to back in S4 is therefore slightly wider than P4, and the related track work dimensions are dead-scale.

She was sponsored by Mrs. Fletcher Bowron and commissioned on 22 July 1945, with Captain John A. Snackenberg in command. Service history 1944-1948 After shakedown out of Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, Los Angeles sailed on 15 October for the Far East via the west coast and arrived at Shanghai, China, on 3 January 1946. During the next year she operated with the 7th Fleet along the coast of China and in the western Pacific to the Marianas. She returned to San Francisco, California, on 21 January 1947, and was decommissioned at Hunters Point on 9 April 1948, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. 1951-1953 Los Angeles was recommissioned on 27 January 1951, Capt. Robert N. McFarlane in command. In response to the American efforts in the Korean War, she sailed for the Far East 14 May and joined naval operations off the eastern coast of Korea on 31 May as flagship for Rear Admiral Arleigh A. Burke's CRUDIV 5. During the next six months she ranged the coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula from Hungnam in the east to Haeju in the west while her guns pounded enemy coastal positions. After returning to the United States on 17 December for overhaul and training, she made her second deployment to Korean waters on 9 October 1952 and participated on 11 October in a concentrated shelling of enemy bunkers and observation points at Koji-ni. During the next few months, she continued to provide off-shore gunfire support for American ground operations, and cruised the Sea of Japan with fast carriers of the 7th Fleet. While participating in the bombardment of Wonsan late in March and early in April 1953, she received minor damage from enemy shore batteries, but continued operations until sailing for the west coast in mid-April. She arrived at Long Beach on 15 May. 1953-1963 Between November 1953 and June 1963 Los Angeles made eight more deployments to the Far East where she served as a cruiser division flagship with the 7th Fleet in support of \\"keeping the peace\\" operations in that troubled part of the world. Her operations sent her from the coast of Japan to the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the East and South China Seas; and with units of the 7th Fleet she steamed to American bases in the Philippines and Okinawa, as well as to Allied bases in South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia, and Taiwan. During the Quemoy- Matsu crisis in 1956, she patrolled the Taiwan Strait to help protect ROC Army units from possible landing offenses from Communist China. When not deployed in the western Pacific, Los Angeles operated out of Long Beach along the west coast and in the Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. She returned to Long Beach from her final Far East deployment on 20 June 1963. Decommissioning and sale While some consideration was made to convert Los Angeles into a single- end Talos missile cruiser, with flagship facilities (in essence a heavy cruiser version of the Oklahoma City) funds were not appropriated for this, (or for a general overhaul to enable her continued fleet service), so she was decommissioned at Long Beach on 15 November 1963 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. Stricken on 1 January 1974, and sold on 16 May 1975 (sale #16-5049) to the National Steel Corporation for $1,864,380.21, and scrapped in San Pedro, California.

It was originally a thirty-storey structure high and was completed in 1972, designed by the architect Richard Seifert and built by John Laing. In recent years, the tower has undergone extensive redevelopment and a height increase. The tower is similar in design to Tower 42, which was designed by the same architect. Previous tenants The tower was the headquarters of IPC Media, one of the biggest publishing companies in Europe. In the late 1970s, the tower became part of the mythos surrounding the British comic 2000 AD, published by IPC, and the building was depicted as home to the 'Nerve Centre' of its alien editor, Tharg. IPC moved to the Blue Fin Building in nearby Bankside in 2007. Redevelopment In February 2005 the then owners Capital & Counties Properties applied for planning permission with a design by Make Architects to remodel the tower by extending it to 34 floors along with replacement buildings for the T-shaped building at its base. Permission was granted in July 2005. However no redevelopment took place. Capital and Counties sold the property to Simon Halabi's Buckingham Securities in 2006 for a reported ¬£80m. As part of their joint venture, CIT and Jadwa Investment purchased the property for ¬£60m in 2010. In July 2011 CIT was awarded planning permission to convert the building to residential use along with additional mixed uses. The redevelopment of the building commenced in January 2013. Six new floors were originally planned to be added to the tower, increasing its height to around . The new tower was to house 173 apartments, with retail units to be built around the base and the existing podium building increased in height and transformed into new office space. In mid 2013, CIT requested permission to increase the tower's height by a further 5 floors (bringing the total to 11) which would bring the tower to . 18 additional apartments would be made available with this increase. The plans were approved by Southwark councillors on 16 July 2013. In September 2012 the joint venture secured ¬£250m of funding from a consortium of Middle Eastern financial institutions. In 2015 the building was purchased by Hermes Central London Limited Partnership who commissioned TPBennett llp to carry out a CAT A fit out design for all of the commercial space, to redesign the retail frontages not already completed and to remodel the entrance to the central street and both of the office entrances. These works also incorporated a new 9 storey feature staircase suspended from the side of the tower building. The additional works were completed in 2017.

She recommissioned at Philadelphia 16 October 1950, Capt. Victor Dismukes Long in command and, upon completion of refresher training, became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6 in the Atlantic. She patrolled in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis of 1956; took part in the International Naval Review celebrating the 350th Anniversary of the foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, 12 June 1957; and participated in the NATO exercise operation \\"Strikeback\\", conducted in the North Sea and Arctic Ocean in September 1957. Besides these duties, Macon continued to receive experimental equipment for testing throughout the period. Having also received missile equipment during January‚ÄìMarch 1956, she launched the first Regulus missile from an Atlantic Fleet cruiser on 8 May while anchored off the North Carolina coast, and then continued tests of the missile as she completed her cycle of Atlantic Fleet operations. On the night of 19‚Äì20 January 1959, Macon, steaming from Cartagena to Marseille, diverted from her course and sped to the aid of burning Italian merchant ship Maria Amata. Macons crew fought the flames, but the ship was soon beyond salvage. Macon then carried the merchantman's crew to Valencia, Spain. USS Macon CA-132 participated in Operation Inland Seas (or Sea) which was a United States Navy operation to celebrate the completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. By the end of 1959 Macon had conducted six midshipmen summer cruises and had spent the fall and winter season of almost every year with the 6th Fleet. The following January, Macon, carrying the U.S. Navy Band, departed Norfolk for a goodwill cruise to South American ports. While on this tour, 19 members of the band perished in a plane crash en route to perform at a state dinner for Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek. With Argentine Naval personnel participating, Macons crew held memorial services in Buenos Aires Harbor on 28 February. Completing this cruise at Rio de Janeiro on 10 March, Macon returned to Boston to resume her cycle of operations with the Atlantic Fleet. Macon was placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia on 10 March 1961. Stricken on 1 November 1969, and sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, New York City, on 5 July 1973 and scrapped in Port Newark, New Jersey.

His broadcasting career spanned over 50 years. Career Murray first joined the English service of Radio Luxembourg in 1949 or 1950 as one of its resident announcers in the Grand Duchy, and remained there until 1956. Back in London, and now calling himself \\"Pete\\" rather than \\"Peter\\", he continued to be heard frequently on Radio Luxembourg for many years, introducing pre-recorded sponsored programmes. He also presented popular music on the BBC Light Programme, particularly in the programme Pete Murray's Party from 1958 to 1961, and co-hosted one of BBC Television's earliest pop music programmes, the skiffle-based Six-Five Special (1957‚Äì1958);\\"Three leaving cast of Six-Five Special\\", The Times (London), 26 March 1958 other regular presenters were Jo Douglas and Freddie Mills. He was a regular panellist on the same channel's Juke Box Jury (1959‚Äì1967). He was the \\"guest DJ\\" on several editions of ABC-TV's Thank Your Lucky Stars (1961‚Äì1966) and he later hosted Come Dancing. He was among the first regular presenters of Top of the Pops when it began in January 1964. In 1961 he co- starred with Dora Bryan in a TV sitcom about two newly weds entitled Happily Ever After. During the early 1960s, he co-hosted the New Musical Express Poll Winners' Concert, annually held at Empire Pool, Wembley, with acts such as the Beatles, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Joe Brown and the Bruvvers, the Who, and many others. These were shown on television. In September 1968, he stood in for Alan Freeman on Pick of the Pops, while Freeman was in New York. Murray linked up with him for a look at the American pop scene during the two shows that he did. Murray hosted the UK heat of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1959 and provided the British commentary for the contest itself on both radio and television in 1959 until 1961 and in 1968 and again in 1972 until 1973 for radio, and television commentary for the 1975 and 1977 contest. He was an occasional comp√®re of variety shows at the London Palladium. Murray was one of the original BBC Radio 1 disc-jockeys when the station started in 1967. By 1969, he was one of the mainstays of BBC Radio 2, where for over ten years he anchored the two-hour magazine show Open House five days a week, heard by 5.5 million listeners.BBC Annual Report, noted in The Times (London), 13 November 1970 One April Fools' Day he pretended that the show was being televised. In 1973 and 1976, he was voted BBC Radio Personality of the Year.The Times (London), 1 January 1973; The Times, (London), 20 April 1976 In 1974, he was featured on the Emerson, Lake and Palmer live album 'Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen' as the master of ceremonies, at the beginning of the album. In 1980, Radio 2 moved Murray from weekday to weekend programming. In 1981 he began a move into more serious, speech-only radio with a stint as presenter of Midweek on BBC Radio 4. In 1984, he started afresh as a presenter for LBC, a local talk radio station in London. He later won the Variety Club of Great Britain award for his show. He introduced his last programme there on 22 December 2002, and has not broadcast regularly since. In August 2008, however, he returned as a presenter on an Internet-only station, UK Light Radio.Media Network blog Murray was also an actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and is a RADA Gold Medallist. On the London stage he starred in the musical Scapa!

She served in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Construction The New Orleans-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as \\"treaty cruisers.\\" Originally classified a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified, soon after being laid down, a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term \\"heavy cruiser\\" was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930. She was laid down on 27 June 1931 by Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 6 September 1933; sponsored by Miss Grace L. Newton; and commissioned on 19 May 1934, Captain Gordon W. Haines in command.  Inter-war period  After shakedown in European waters from July‚ÄìSeptember 1934 and alterations in Philadelphia Navy Yard, the new heavy cruiser departed on 4 April 1935 for the Panama Canal and San Diego, arriving on 18 April to join Cruiser Division 7 (CruDiv 7), Scouting Force. She operated along the west coast, aside from a cruise to the Caribbean early in 1939, until arriving at Pearl Harbor in 1940.  World War II  When Japan attacked her base on 7 December 1941, Minneapolis was at sea for gunnery practice about from Pearl Harbor. She immediately took up patrol until late January 1942 when she joined a carrier task force about to raid the Gilberts and Marshalls. While screening on 1 February, she helped turn back an air attack in which three Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" medium bombers were shot down. She screened the carriers during their successful raids on 20 February and again on 10 March, when they attacked Japanese shipping at Lae and Salamaua, disrupting enemy supply lines to those garrisons.  Battle of the Coral Sea  Minneapolis took part in the Battle of the Coral Sea from 4‚Äì8 May 1942, screening Lexington through the great air engagement and shooting down three Japanese bombers. She rescued survivors when Lexington was lost, part of the price for preserving the vital lines of communication to Australia and New Zealand and stopping further Japanese expansion southward.  Battle of Midway  The cruiser was also engaged in the second key battle of the early phase of the Pacific war, the Battle of Midway from 3‚Äì6 June 1942, again protecting the carriers task force from Japanese air attack.  Battle of Tassafaronga  Minneapolis in December 1942, showing damage received in the Battle of Tassafaronga After replenishing and repairing at Pearl Harbor, Minneapolis sailed to protect the carriers as they covered the landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi from 7‚Äì9 August. Remaining with the carriers, she went to the aid of on 30 August, when the carrier took a torpedo hit, and towed her from the danger area. Through September and October, she supported landings west of Lunga Point and on Funafuti. As flagship of Task Force 67 (TF 67), she sortied on 29 November to intercept a Japanese force attempting to reinforce Guadalcanal. At 23:05 the next night, she spotted six Japanese ships, and the Battle of Tassafaronga was opened by her fire. She scored many hits on , which sank. However, a second group of Japanese destroyers, which had been giving distant cover to the transport group, entered the action, and Minneapolis took two torpedo hits, one on the port bow, the other in her number two fireroom, causing loss of power and severe damage; her bow collapsing back to the chain pipes, her port side badly ruptured, and two firerooms open to the sea. Of the battle, American naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote, \\"It is a painful truth that the Battle of Tassafaronga was a sharp defeat inflicted on an alert and superior cruiser force by a partially surprised and inferior destroyer force.\\" The ship was saved however by skillful damage control work and seamanship that kept her afloat and enabled her to reach Tulagi. There, camouflaged with palm fronds and shrubs to protect her from frequent air raids, she was temporarily repaired by her own crew with the help of a Seabee unit stationed on the island, and was able to sail for extensive repairs at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. A new bow was built for her during her transit back to the shipyard and was almost ready to be mated on by the time of her arrival. While there she received a remodeling of her forward bridge and added new radars and numerous 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. By August 1943, Minneapolis was back in the Pacific for 20 months of frontline duty, which would include every major Pacific operation by American forces save Iwo Jima. Her first was the bombardment of Wake on 5 October, then from 20 November to 4 December she joined in the assault and capture of Makin in the Gilberts. In December, she screened a carrier group in the pre-invasion strikes against Kwajalein and Majuro, serving on in the capture of the Marshalls into mid- February 1944. With the carriers blasting the Marianas and the Carolines, Minneapolis continued to guard them through raids on the Palaus, Truk, Satawan, Ponape, and other key Japanese bases into April. The latter raids were coordinated with the landings at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), New Guinea.  Battle of the Philippine Sea  In May, Minneapolis prepared at Majuro for the assaults in the Marianas, firing on Saipan in preinvasion bombardment on 14 June. As word came that a large Japanese force was sailing to attempt a disruption of the operation, Minneapolis rejoined TF 58 to screen the carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19‚Äì20 June. As American aviators won another great victory, Minneapolis screened the carriers and provided antiaircraft fire. After taking a bomb miss close aboard, her crew again patched her up.  Guam  From 8 July to 9 August, Minneapolis brought her heavy guns to the support of the Marines winning Guam back from the enemy. Firing deep support, night harassing, and call fire, she won grateful praise from General Allen H. Turnage, commanding the 3rd Marine Division: \\"...a prime factor in the success of this operation...a job well done.\\" From 6 September to 14 October, she gave similar essential aid to the capture of the Palaus, her operations at the close of that period preparing directly for the assault on Leyte. In the preinvasion bombardment force, she entered Leyte Gulf on 17 October, and she downed five enemy planes during the initial resistance to the assault.  Battle of Surigao Strait  The Battle of Surigao Strait. As the Japanese launched the three-pronged naval attack which would develop into the Battle for Leyte Gulf, Minneapolis was assigned on 24 October to Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's bombardment group with other cruisers and older battleships. With them, she deployed across Surigao Strait that night, alert to any sign of contact with the enemy by the plucky PT-boats and destroyers fanned out ahead. As the Japanese ships steamed in column, they ignored the flank attacks of the smaller ships, heading straight for Oldendorf's battleline, which opened fire with an enormous coordinated salvo, quickly sinking the Japanese old battleship Yamashiro. The battleline, including Minneapolis, also crippled the heavy cruiser Mogami and the destroyer Shigure (the drifting Mogami was sunk by aircraft later that day). Admiral Oldendorf, in this Battle of Surigao Strait, had performed the classic maneuver of \\"crossing the T\\", meeting the individual fire of the enemy with his own massed fire. Continuing to alternate carrier screening and bombardment duties in the Philippines, Minneapolis was on the scene for the attack and landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon from 4‚Äì18 January 1945 and the landings on Bataan and Corregidor from 13‚Äì18 February. During March,, she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa, off which she arrived for preinvasion bombardment on the 25th. She fired at once on Kerama Retto, seized first in a move to provide a safe haven for ships during the assault on Okinawa proper. When the main invasion began 1 April, Minneapolis bombarded the Japanese airfield at Naha, rendering it useless to the enemy, then began call fire as ground forces pinpointed her targets by radio. After months of such action, her gun barrels were worn so badly as to need replacement, and she prepared to sail on 12 April. Her departure was delayed that day by the largest air attack yet of the Okinawa operation, during which she downed four would-be kamikazes and watched three others crash harmlessly into the sea. At nightfall, she sailed for Bremerton, Washington, where she repaired and replaced the linings of her gun barrels. Headed back for more action, she was in Subic Bay, Philippines, at the end of hostilities. She flew the flag of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid as he accepted the Japanese surrender of Korea on 9 September, then patrolled the Yellow Sea, covering the landing of Marines at Taku and Chinwangtao, China. After carrying homeward bound veterans to the west coast, she sailed on 14 January 1946 for the Panama Canal and Philadelphia. Here she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 May, and out of commission on 10 February 1947. She was sold for scrapping on 14 August 1959 to Union Metals and Alloys Corp.

It is a common choice in the United Kingdom for the modelling of narrow-gauge railways whose prototype gauges lie approximately between and . The track gauge is used by N gauge model railways, a common commercial scale, which means that a selection of wheels, track, and mechanisms is readily available. gauge railways were common in Britain, but the gauge implied by 9mm at 4mm scale - - was quite rare - today only the Talyllyn and Corris railways in the UK use this gauge. However at 4mm/ft scale, the differences to gauge required to correct this are barely perceptible by eye, and the wide use of 9mm gauge in the modelling community is generally accepted to be an appropriate compromise. For example, the correct gauge for a 2ft prototype would be 8mm, but such a difference of 1mm from the OO9 standard is usually treated as insignificant for most modellers. The 009 Society exists to connect modelers, issues a monthly colour newsletter (\\"009 NEWS\\"), commissions its own range of kits, and provides a popular second hand resale service. There is a growing range of commercially available ready to run support for OO9, with a number of manufacturers announcing ranges of products, and small manufacturers making limited runs of models from time to time. In November 2012, Peco announced the launch, during 2013, of a range of ready to run 009 coaches and wagons, based on prototypes of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway.Peco new product announcement (retrieved 29 November 2012) This was followed in the March 2013 edition of Railway Modeller Magazine, by Danish manufacturer Heljan announcing an 009 locomotive based on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Manning Wardle 2-6-2Ts. Peco have since released ready to run carriages for the Glyn Valley Tramway (GVT), Ffestiniog railway slate waggons and other general stock such as V tipper and 4 wheel flat wagons. In July 2014, Bachmann announced a range of ready to run 009 products, starting with a Baldwin Class 10-12-D locomotive and a number of wagons, primarily used by the British War Department during World War I.Introducing Bachmann's Narrow Gauge range (retrieved 23 December 2014) To date a range of Baldwin liveries have been released including models representing prototypes from the WHR, Ashover, Snailbeach, GVT and War Department. These have been launched alongside a range of wagons and a 'might have been' fictional Lynton and Barnstaple Baldwin locomotive named 'Sid'. Further Bachmann models representing Quarry Hunslet locomotives, small industrial diesels alongside further coaches and wagons are expected to arrive in the next couple of years after announcements in Bachmann catalogues. In late 2019 Peco announced a new joint venture with Japanese manufacturer Kato, together they plan to release models of the Ffestiniog Railway England and Double Fairlie locomotives. Peco are also planning to release Ffestiniog rolling stock including bug boxes, quarrymens coaches and larger bogie 'Bowsider' coaches. The modeller can also choose from a wide range of plastic, white metal and etched brass kit manufacturers such as Dundas Models, Meridian Models, Mercian Models, GEM, Rodney Stenning, Worsley works, Narrow Planet, Nigel Lawton etc. Many of these companies attend narrow gauge focussed exhibitions - a diary of events is available to all on the OO9 society website (link below). Some modellers also adapt models originally made for OO or utilise scratch building techniques. Many OO9 modellers also use H0e equipment, which although built for 3.5mm scale, not 4mm, is often close enough to work alongside OO9. Standard H0e 'bemo' style loop couplings are most often used. A slimmer alternative also with a loop is the Greenwich coupling which is compatible with these standard couplings and can be magnetically operated. Some modellers use chopper couplings or repurpose couplers made originally for other scales such as DG couplings. MicroTrains or Kadee couplings intended for N gauge can also been used. Related scales Using N gauge 9 mm track to model narrow-gauge prototypes is also popular in HO scale model railways. In Europe, this is known as H0e while in the United States this is called HOn30 or HOn2. As the latter indicates, 9 mm in HO scale is in the theoretical prototype, closer to gauge. gauge lines (common in Ireland and the Isle of Man) are generally modelled in 4 mm scale but with gauge track, which is known as OOn3.

It is located on Bishopsgate, a major thoroughfare in the City of London financial district. The building is tall and has 25 office floors, with a total net lettable floor space of circa . There are a further three plant floors at levels LG, 14 and 27. The original core and steelwork was completed in 1976. At the time, it had the fastest lifts in Europe, running at up to 6.5 metres per second. The building was occupied solely by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) until the organisation moved to 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf (that building subsequently became known as the HSBC Tower). 99 Bishopsgate was extensively damaged in 1993 by a truck bomb exploded by the Provisional IRA, which also damaged the neighbouring Tower 42. The building was fully refurbished over a period of 14 months, which resulted in substantially improved cladding and a fa√ßade overrun which increased its overall height slightly. Larger, open plan floorplates were also created. It re-opened in mid-1995 as a multi-let office tower and is currently owned (leasehold) by Hammerson and managed by CBRE Group. CBRE has produced an energy performance certificate (EPC) for 99 Bishopsgate which has resulted in a 'C' rating for the building. The factors that influenced the rating are the impact of specifying energy efficient plant and equipment during refits and the standard of building-related information made available for the purposes of EPC calculation. Considering the age of the building, a 'C' rating is considered impressive.

The host and star of the show is Jamie Kennedy, a comedian who presented a reality TV format which combined hidden camera with sketch comedy. The show was a production of Bahr-Small Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and Big Ticket Television and ran from January 13, 2002 until April 29, 2004. Format The show's format vaguely resembled that of earlier TV shows like Candid Camera. In the show, Kennedy travelled across the U.S. and found people to participate in his on- camera practical jokes (\\"experiments\\"). Usually there was at least one person who was in on the joke and the \\"mark\\" or victim of the prank (usually a friend or relative of the accomplice). Kennedy dons one of several disguises and assumed a character of his own creation to be part of the gag, often using a different voice. The mark then finds him/herself in some bizarre, unbelievable situation. When it appeared that the mark has had as much nonsense as he or she could tolerate, Kennedy delivered his punchline: \\"You've been X'ed!\\".  Recurring sketches  * \\"Brad \\"B-Rad\\" Gluckman\\" ‚Äì A skit where Jamie portrayed a stereotypical white rapper, often trying to convince the mark to let him stay at his/her house. The \\"B-Rad\\" character was later spun off into a movie, Malibu's Most Wanted. * \\"Pizza Delivery\\" ‚Äì A skit where a mark was hired as a pizza delivery boy to a pizza shop run by the mafia. * \\"Judge Jamie\\" ‚Äì A parody on numerous judge shows, Jamie played the role of James W. Leighland, an old, confused, and incompetent judge, often with perverted tendencies. * \\"Jaw Surgery\\" ‚Äì A skit where Jamie \\"X'es\\" his marks by pretending to have just had jaw surgery, and had to wear a metal-wire contraption that keeps his mouth open. He played different characters in different skits, but they have all just had the same gag. * \\"Virginia Hamm\\" ‚Äì A parody of daytime talk shows, Jamie would undergo an entire transformation and become a heavyset black female talk show host. * \\"You Be the Judge\\" ‚Äì Another parody on judge shows, a mark was picked to be the judge for an episode, and had to preside over a case with an extremely unusual plaintiff or defendant. * \\"Lou Hollander\\" ‚Äì A skit where Jamie portrayed a driving school teacher, with the student as his mark, and had to \\"take a detour\\" during the lesson due to family/marital issues. Also used during the second season, but with Lou Hollander having a paper route instead. * \\"Old Rascal\\" ‚Äì A skit where Jamie dressed up as Mario, the world's oldest waiter, and the gag on the mark was that Mario was retiring, and he/she would be his last table. Syndication In September 2004, ABC Family added the series to its lineup. G4 also aired the show in 2006 for a brief period. It has not been seen on TV since.

The organisation is responsible for the Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt of July 1990, in which its leader, Imam Yasin Abu Bakr, led members of the Jamaat in an attempted coup d'√©tat against the elected Government of Trinidad and Tobago. Over a six- day period members of the government, including then-Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson, were held hostage at gunpoint, while the group occupied a television station and parliament, and chaos and looting broke out in the streets of the capital, Port of Spain. Origins The background for the foundation of movement is a widespread presence of black racism, the division of community on the basis of race, the illicit drug trade and ideology of extremist jihad. The next step was a development of a militant Islamic discourse which insisted that liberation for especially Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians was only found within the ambit of Islam. As the result, a group called Jamaat al Muslimeen (JAM), an Afro-Trinidadian Muslim movement, was founded. Coup attempt In July 1990, forty-two insurgents stormed the parliament, taking Prime Minister Arthur Napoleon Raymond (ANR) Robinson and most of his staff hostage. Seventy-two insurgents stormed a local police station, and at 6:00 PM JAM leader Yasin Abu Bakr told the public the government had been overthrown. During the four-day siege in which 24 people were killed, JAM agreed to surrender in exchange for amnesty. Abu Bakr and 114 of his followers were granted presidential pardons, which were later retracted, but no JAM members from the coup have ever served jail time in connection with the attack. A court ruling upheld an amnesty agreement obtained during the incarceration of parliament by the group. This led to the non-prosecution of its members for this crime despite the contention that the fact that guns and force were used to obtain said amnesty constituted duress. Subsequent to the attempted coup, it aligned itself publicly first with the United National Congress (in the run-up to the 1995 General Elections) and later with the People's National Movement (PNM), the party which formed the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago until May 2010. Other crimes Before and since those elections, however, present and past members have been connected or prosecuted for serious violent crimes. These crimes include drug and gang related killings, rape and the spree of kidnappings for ransom of members of the local upper and middle class. The organisation's leader is currently being prosecuted with conspiracy to murder several of the group's former members who had spoken out publicly against the Jamaat al Muslimeen and its practices, and who were suspected of becoming witnesses in legal proceedings against its members. In 2005, The group was suspected of being linked to a series of bombings in Port-of-Spain and also for a group member arrested in the United States for attempting to ship 70 assault rifles from Fort Lauderdale to Trinidad. As of March 2007, three members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen have confessed to their role in the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a businesswoman, Vindra Naipaul-Coolman. Currently, these men are under surveillance by the local National Security Agency as well as the United States Central Intelligence Agency for suspected terrorist relations with the Middle East, as are two other Muslim factions. On 24 July 2015, they escaped and commenced in a shootout in the Country's capital Port of Spain and the Port of Spain General Hospital which put the capital on a lock down and caused the twin islands to be on high alert. One escapee was killed by the police during a later shoot-out at the Port of Spain general hospital.Jamaica Observer article Abu Bakr was investigated in 2007 when the reports of an attempted bombing attempt at John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport linked JAM to one of the perpetrators, a Trinidadian national. The suspects reportedly asked Abu Bakr for assistance in carrying out this plot. Abu Bakr and JAM deny any connection to participating in the plot. In 2014, eleven JAM members allegedly participated in the assassination of Dana Seetahal, an independent senator. During the trial a Special Branch intelligence memo featuring an unconfirmed report was leaked to social media. The report indicated that law enforcement feared violence from JAM amid reports the group may have been moving arms in preparation for an attack on police stations. No attack materialised however. On 14 July 2015, JAM members launched an armed jailbreak of the suspected assassins in the Seetahal case. During a shoot out one police officer and one JAM member were killed. JAM and Abu Bakr‚Äôs influence has waned somewhat when the rise of ISIS has become known in the region. A total of 89 Trinidadian and Tobagonians have already pledged allegiance to the group and a group of Salafists attempted to assassinate the prime minister.

Spanish literature generally refers to literature (Spanish poetry, prose, and drama) written in the Spanish language within the territory that presently constitutes the Kingdom of Spain. Its development coincides and frequently intersects with that of other literary traditions from regions within the same territory, particularly Catalan literature, Galician intersects as well with Latin, Jewish, and Arabic literary traditions of the Iberian peninsula. The literature of Spanish America is an important branch of Spanish literature, with its own particular characteristics dating back to the earliest years of Spain‚Äôs conquest of the Americas (see Latin American literature). Overview The Roman conquest and occupation of the Iberian peninsula beginning in the 3rd century BC brought a Latin culture to Spanish territories. The arrival of Muslim invaders in 711 CE brought the cultures of the Middle and Far East. In medieval Spanish literature, the earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature mix Muslim, Jewish, and Christian culture. One of the notable works is the epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid, written in 1140. Spanish prose gained popularity in the mid-thirteenth century. Lyric poetry in the Middle Ages includes popular poems and the courtly poetry of the nobles. During the 15th century the pre-Renaissance occurred and literary production increased greatly. In the Renaissance important topics were poetry, religious literature, and prose. In the 16th century the first Spanish novels appeared, Lazarillo de Tormes and Guzm√°n de Alfarache. In the Baroque era of the 17th century important works were the prose of Francisco de Quevedo and Baltasar Graci√°n. A notable author was Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, famous for his masterpiece Don Quixote de la Mancha. In this novel Cervantes consolidated the form of literature that the picaresque novel had established in Spain to a fictional narrative that became the template for many novelists throughout the history of Spanish literature.J.A. Garrido Ardila \\"A Concise Introduction to the History of the Spanish Novel\\" A History of the Spanish Novel, Oxford University Press 2015 In the Enlightenment era of the 18th century, notable works include the prose of Feijoo, Jovellanos, and Cadalso; the lyric of Juan Mel√©ndez Vald√©s, Tom√°s de Iriarte and F√©lix Mar√≠a Samaniego), and the theater, with Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n, Ram√≥n de la Cruz, and Vicente Garc√≠a de la Huerta. In Romanticism (beginning of the 19th century) important topics are: the poetry of Jos√© de Espronceda and other poets; prose; the theater, with √Ångel de Saavedra (Duke of Rivas), Jos√© Zorrilla, and other authors. In Realism (end of the 19th century), which is mixed with Naturalism, important topics are the novel, with Juan Valera, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda, Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, Leopoldo Alas (Clar√≠n), Armando Palacio Vald√©s, and Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez; poetry, with Ram√≥n de Campoamor, Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce, and other poets; the theater, with Jos√© Echegaray, Manuel Tamayo y Baus, and other dramatists; and the literary critics, emphasizing Men√©ndez Pelayo. In Modernism several currents appear: Parnasianism, Symbolism, Futurism, and Creationism. The destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by the U.S. in 1898 provoked a crisis in Spain. A group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, P√≠o Baroja, and Jos√© Mart√≠nez Ruiz (Azor√≠n), made changes to literature's form and content. By the year 1914‚Äîthe year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset‚Äîa number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field. Leading voices include the poet Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, the academics and essayists Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Gregorio Mara√±on, Manuel Aza√±a, Eugeni d'Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Mir√≥, Ram√≥n P√©rez de Ayala, and Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna. Around 1920 a younger group of writers‚Äîmostly poets‚Äîbegan publishing works that from their beginnings revealed the extent to which younger artists were absorbing the literary experimentation of the writers of 1898 and 1914. Poets were closely tied to formal academia. Novelists such as Benjam√≠n Jarn√©s, Rosa Chacel, Francisco Ayala, and Ram√≥n J. Sender were equally experimental and academic. The Spanish Civil War had a devastating impact on Spanish writing. Among the handful of civil war poets and writers, Miguel Hern√°ndez stands out. During the early dictatorship (1939‚Äì1955), literature followed dictator Francisco Franco's reactionary vision of a second, Catholic Spanish golden age. By the mid-1950s, just as with the novel, a new generation which had only experienced the Spanish Civil War in childhood was coming of age. By the early 1960s, Spanish authors moved towards a restless literary experimentation. When Franco died in 1975, the important work of establishing democracy had an immediate impact on Spanish letters. Over the next several years a wealth of young new writers, among them Juan Jos√© Mill√°s, Rosa Montero, Javier Mar√≠as, Luis Mateo D√≠ez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Merino, F√©lix de Az√∫a, Cristina Fern√°ndez Cubas, Enrique Vila-Matas, Carme Riera, and later Antonio Mu√±oz Molina and Almudena Grandes, would begin carving out a prominent place for themselves within the Spanish cultural field. Pre-medieval literature The Roman conquest and occupation of the peninsula, spanning from the 3rd century BC to the year 409 A.D, brought a fully developed Latin culture to Spanish territories. The Roman philosopher Seneca (1 BCE-65 AD) was born in Spain as were the poets Martial (41-104 AD), Quintilian (35-100 AD), and Lucan (39-65 AD). While the invasion of Germanic tribes in the fifth century A.D. put an end to Roman Spain, the tribes‚Äô relative lack of advanced culture, including any kind of literary tradition, meant that any written literature produced in the Iberian Peninsula continued along Romanized lines. Outstanding amongst the works produced is Saint Isidore of Seville‚Äôs (c. 560-636) Etymologiae, an attempted summa of all classical knowledge. Called ‚Äúthe last scholar of the ancient world\\", St. Isidore penned theological and proto-scientific treatises, letters, and a series of histories that would serve as models for the rest of Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages. The arrival of Muslim invaders in 711 CE brought the cultures of the Middle and Far East to the Iberian Peninsula and ultimately to all of Europe. During the era of relative religious tolerance that followed, writers such as the Jewish theologian Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204) or the Muslim polymath (1126‚Äì1198) Averroes penned works of theology, science, philosophy, and mathematics that would have lasting impacts on Hebrew and Muslim philosophy and prove essential to the flowering of the European Renaissance centuries later. While none of their works can be considered direct ancestors of a Spanish literary tradition, it was out of the cultural milieu fostered by such intellectual energy that the first written manifestations of a Spanish literature proper arise. Medieval Spanish literature  Andalusi literature  The period of Islamic rule in Iberia from 711 to 1492 brought many new literary traditions to Spain. Most literature at this time was produced in standard Arabic, though poetry and other forms of literature of the Jewish golden age found expression in Judeo-Arabic or Hebrew. Maimonides, for example, wrote his magnum opus The Guide for the Perplexed in Arabic with Hebrew script. Other major literary figures of the time include Ibn Arabi, Al- Mu'tamid ibn Abbad, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Zayd√∫n and Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al- Rukuniyya. Important literary styles include the muwashah, maqama, and nawba. Important works include Hadith Bayad wa Riyad and The Incoherence of the Incoherence. The kharjas The earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked. The Jarchas, dating from the 9th to the 12th centuries C.E., were short poems spoken in local colloquial Hispano-Romance dialects, known as Mozarabic, but written in Arabic script. The Jarchas appeared at the end of longer poetry written in Arabic or Hebrew known as muwashshah, which were lengthy glosses on the ideas expressed in the jarchas. Typically spoken in the voice of a woman, the jarchas express the anxieties of love, particularly of its loss. This combination of Hispano-Romance expression with Arabic script, only discovered in 1948, locates the rise of a Spanish literary tradition in the cultural heterogeneity that characterized Medieval Spanish society and politics. However, the Mozarabic language of the Jarchas appears to be a separate Romance language whose evolution from Vulgar Latin paralleled that of Castilian Spanish rather than deriving from or fusing into the latter. Hence, while the relatively recent discovery of the Jarchas challenges pride of chronological place that belonged for so long to the Poema del Cid (El Cantar de m√≠o Cid) (1140 CE) in the history of Spanish literature, they cannot be seen as a precursor to Spain's great epic poem. What the discovery of the jarchas makes clear instead is that from its origins, the literature of Spain has arisen out of and born witness to a rich, heterogeneous mix of cultures and languages.Linda Fish Compton: Review of Andalusian Lyrical Poetry and Old Spanish Love Songs: The \\"Muwashshah\\" and Its \\"Kharja.\\" by S.

The poet, name unknown, wrote the epic in about 1140 and Cid supposedly died forty years before in 1099. This epic represents realism, because nothing was exaggerated and the details are very real, even the geography correctly portrays the areas in which Cid traveled and lived. Unlike other European epics, the poem is not idealized and there is no presence of supernatural beings. It has assonance instead of rhyme and its lines vary in length, the most common length being fourteen syllables. This type of verse is known as mester de juglaria (verse form of the minstrels). The epic is divided into three parts, also known as cantos. Mester de Juglar√≠a Medieval Spanish poets recognized the Mester de Juglar√≠a as a literary form written by the minstrels (juglares) and composed of varying line length and use of assonance instead of rhyme. These poems were sung to uneducated audiences, nobles and peasants alike. Mester de Clerec√≠a This Castilian narrative poetry known as the Mester de Clerec√≠a became popular in the thirteenth century. It is the verse form of the learned poets, usually clerics (hence the name 'clerec√≠a'). The poetry was formal, with carefully counted syllables in each line. Popular themes were Christian legends, lives of saints and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were cited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglar√≠a: didacticism and erudition. Gonzalo de Berceo was one of the greatest advocates of this school, writing on religious subjects. Spanish prose Spanish prose gained popularity in the mid-thirteenth century when King Alfonso X of Castile gave support and recognition to the writing form. He, with the help of his groups of intellectuals, directed the composition of many prose works including Las siete partidas, the first modern book of laws of the land written in the people's language. Another work was La primera cr√≥nica general which accounted for the history of Spain from the creation until the end of Alfonso's father's reign, San Fernando. For his direction of these works and many others he directed, Alfonso X is called the father of Spanish prose. His nephew, Don Juan Manuel is famous for his prose work El Conde Lucanor which is a frame story or short stories within an overall story. In this work, the Conde Lucanor seeks advice from his wise counselor, Patronio, who gives the advice through the telling of stories. Juan Manuel also wrote lesser-known works such as El libro de los estados on the social classes and El libro del caballero y escudero on philosophical discussions. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, writer Fernando del Pulgar (1436-1490?) created a new type of prose named the verbal portrait. This form is demonstrated by Pulgar's work Claros varones de Castilla in which he represents the detailed lives of twenty-four distinguished contemporaries. He explores their moral and psychological natures as well as physical traits. Pulgar was the official historian of the monarchs Fernando and Isabel, the famous Catholic Monarchs of Spain. This position gave him close encounters with the characters in this book, making the work realistic and detailed. Lyric poetry of the Middle Ages Lyric poetry in the Middle Ages can be divided into three groups: the jarchas, the popular poems originating from folk-songs sung by commoners, and the courtly poetry of the nobles. Alfonso X of Castile fits into the third group with his series of three hundred poems, written in Galician: Las cantigas de Santa Mar√≠a. Another poet, Juan Ruiz, or the Arcipreste de Hita is an outstanding lyricist of the fourteenth century. His only work, Libro de buen amor is a framework tale in which he includes translations from Ovid, satires, little poems called serranillas, twenty-nine fables, a sermon on Christian armor, and many lyric poems that praise the Virgin Mary. Poet √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, the Marqu√©s de Santillana (1398‚Äì1458), begins to show the movement away from the traditions of the Middle Ages. He shows a knowledge of Latin authors and familiarity with the works of Dante and Petrarch. Mendoza was also the first to introduce the sonnet into Spanish literature. The last great poet of the Middle Ages is Jorge Manrique. He is famous for his work which laments the death of his father, Coplas a la muerte de su padre. In this piece, Manrique shows classical feelings by expressing himself in a universal manner (all things come to an end). He is still considered a poet of the Middle Ages in that he finds peace and finality in religion. Renaissance La Celestina by Fernando de Rojas The 15th century may be thought of as a pre-Renaissance period. Literary production increases greatly. Outstanding poets of this century include Juan de Mena and √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza (Marquess of Santillana). Spanish literature of the Middle Ages concludes with La Celestina by Fernando de Rojas. Important Renaissance themes are poetry, with Garcilaso de la Vega and Juan Bosc√°n; religious literature, with Fray Luis de Le√≥n, San Juan de la Cruz, and Santa Teresa de Jes√∫s; and prose, with the anonymous El Lazarillo de Tormes. Among the principal features of the Renaissance were the revival of learning based on classical sources, the rise of courtly patronage, the development of perspective in painting, and advances in science. The most important characteristics of the Renaissance are: * The prevalence of natural, uncomplicated language, avoiding affectation, amaneramiento and the over- refined phrase, producing simple vocabulary and straightforward syntax. * Themes such as love - conceived from the platonic point of view; nature - as somewhat idyllic (bucolic); pagan mythology - concerned with female beauty and the histories of the gods, following always the same classical ideal. In relation to these themes, various Renaissance points exist (???) some of them taken from the classical world:  Carpe Diem, (\\"seize the day\\" or \\"take advantage of the moment\\"), which recommends the enjoyment of life before the arrival of old age.  Collige, virgo, rosas which literary means \\"Pick virgin the roses\\" and is a metaphor similar to Carpe Diem but applied to female beauty, described always following the same plan: a young blonde, with serene, clear eyes, white skin, red lips, rosy cheeks, etc.  The Beatus Ille or praise of rural life, away from material things, as opposed to life in the city, with its dangers and intrigues.  The Locus Amoenus or description of nature in all its idyllic perfection.

In the works of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra notable novels are La Galatea and Don Quixote de la Mancha. The Baroque style used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music. The Baroque is characterized by the following points: * Pessimism: The Renaissance had not achieved its purpose of imposing harmony and perfection in the world, as the humanists intended, nor had it made man happier; wars and social inequality continued to be present; pain and calamities were commonplace throughout Europe. An intellectual pessimism took hold, which increased as time passed. This was shown by the angry character of the comedies of that epoch, and by rascal characters on which the picaresque novels are based. * Disillusionment: As the Renaissance ideals failed, and, in the case of Spain, political power was being dispelled, disillusionment continued to arise in literature. Many cases recall those of two centuries before, with the Danza de la Muerte or Manrique's Coplas a la muerte de su padre. Quevedo said that life is formed by \\"successions of deceased\\". Newborns turn into the deceased, and diapers into the shroud that covers lifeless bodies. This leads to the conclusion that nothing is important except obtaining eternal salvation. * Worry about the passing of time. * Loss of confidence in the Renaissance ideals.

Enlightenment thinkers sought to apply systematic thinking to all forms of human activity, carrying it to the ethical and governmental spheres in exploration of the individual, society and the state. Three phases in the Spanish literature of the 18th century are distinguished: * Anti-Baroquism (until approximately 1750): It fights against the style of the preceding Baroque, which is considered excessively rhetorical and twisted. The recreational literature is not cultivated, but they are more interested in the essay and satire, utilizing the language with simplicity and purity. * Neoclassicism (until the end of the 18th century): It is strongly influenced by French and Italian classicism. The writers also imitate the old classics (Greek and Roman); its boom extended since the reign of Fernando VI until the end of the century. * Pre-Romanticism (end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century): The influence of the English philosopher John Locke, together with that of the French √âtienne Bonnot of Condillac, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Denis Diderot, will cause a new feeling, dissatisfaction with the tyranny of reason, that emphasizes the right of the individuals to express their personal emotions (repressed then by the neoclassicals), among which figures fundamentally love. This current announces the decline of Neoclassicism and opens the door to Romanticism. Romanticism Early Romanticism appeared with the singular figure of Manuel Jos√© Quintana. √Ångel de Saavedra In Romanticism (beginning of the 19th century) important topics are: the poetry of Jos√© de Espronceda and other poets; prose, which can have several forms (the historical novel, scientific prose, the description of regional customs, journalism ‚Äîwhere Mariano Jos√© de Larra can be mentioned‚Äî; the theater, with √Ångel de Saavedra (Duke of Rivas), Jos√© Zorrilla, and other authors. In the latter romanticism (post-romanticism) some appear:Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer and Rosal√≠a de Castro. Some anti-romantic poets are Ram√≥n de Campoamor and Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce. In part a revolt against aristocratic, social, and political norms of the Enlightenment period and a reaction against the rationalization of nature, in art and literature Romanticism stressed strong emotion as a source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror, and the awe experienced in confronting the sublimity of nature. It elevated folk art, nature and custom. The characteristics of the works of Romanticism are: * Rejection of Neoclassicism. Contrary to the scrupulous severity and order with which the rules were observed in the 18th century, the romanticist writers combine the genres and verses of different measures, at times mixing verse and prose; in theater, the rule of the three units (place, space and time) is despised and they alternate comedy with drama. * Subjectivism. Whatever kind of work it is, the exalted soul of the author pours into it all his feelings of dissatisfaction against a world that limits and breaks the flight of his desire about love, society, patriotism, etc. They do so in such a way that nature fuses with their state of spirit and it is melancholic, tetric, mysterious, dark... as opposed to the neoclassicals, who barely showed interest in the landscape. The longings for passionate love, desire for happiness, and possession of the infinite, cause a discomfort in the romanticist, an immense deception that from time to time carries them to suicide, as is the case of Mariano Jos√© de Larra. * Attraction to the nocturnal and mysterious. The romantics situate their aching and disillusioned feelings in mysterious or melancholic places, such as ruins, forests, cemeteries... Similarly they feel an attraction toward the supernatural, things that escape any logic, such as miracles, apparitions, visions of the afterlife, the diabolic and the witchlike... * Escape from the world that surrounds them. Rejection of the bourgeois society in which they are forced to live makes the romanticist be evaded from his circumstances, imagining passed epochs in which their ideals prevailed over the others, or being inspired in the exotic. In contrast with the neoclassicals, who admired the Greco-Latin antiquity, the romanticists prefer the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Among their more frequent kinds of works, they cultivate the novel, legend and historic drama. Various are the themes of the romanticist works: * Oneself. In Espronceda's Song to Teresa, a heartwrenching confession of love and disillusion, he has managed to poeticize his feelings with great success. * Passionate love, with sudden, total deliveries and quick abandonments. Exaltation and distaste. * They are inspired in legendary and historic themes. * Religion, although it is often in defiance of the consequent compassion and even exaltation of the devil. * Social demands (revaluation of marginalized types, such as the beggar). * Nature, shown in all its modalities and variations. Usually set in mysterious places, such as cemeteries, storms, the rough sea, etc. * Satire, connected with political or literary events.

Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general \\"Realism,\\" Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation. The realistic works of this period are characterized by: * Objective vision of reality through the direct observation of customs or psychological characters. They eliminate any subjective aspect, fantastic events, and every feeling that moves away from reality: \\"The novel is the image of life\\" (Gald√≥s), \\"an artistic copy of reality\\" (Clar√≠n). * Defense of a thesis: the narrators write their works approaching reality from their moral conception. They are the so-called omniscient narrators. The defense of a thesis usually compromises the objectivity of the novel. * Themes that are familiar to the reader: marital conflicts, infidelity, defense of ideals, etc. * The popular and colloquial language acquires great importance since it situates the characters in their real environment. Modernist literature Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez In Modernism several currents appear: Parnasianism, Symbolism, Futurism, and Creationism. Literary Modernism in Spain was influenced by the \\"disaster of '98\\", Regenerationism, and the Free Institution of Education (founded by Giner de los R√≠os). Modernism was rooted in the idea that \\"traditional\\" forms of art, literature, religious faith, social organization, and daily life had become outdated; therefore it was essential to sweep them aside. The intellectual movement that thinks objectively and scientifically about the causes of the decadence of Spain as a nation between the 19th and the 20th century is called Regenerationism. It expresses a pessimist judgement about Spain. The regenerationist intellectuals divulgated their studies in journals with a big diffusion, so the movement expanded. Some important Modernist authors are Salvador Rueda, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Miguel de Unamuno and Rub√©n Dar√≠o. 20th century literature  The Generation of 1898  The destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by U.S. gunboats in 1898 provoked a general cultural crisis in Spain. The \\"Disaster\\" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of \\"Regeneracionismo\\". For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, P√≠o Baroja, and Jos√© Mart√≠nez Ruiz (Azor√≠n), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and √Ångel Ganivet, came to be known as the \\"Generation of 98\\". The label from its outset was controversial and even Azor√≠n, the source of its origin, came to reject it. Nevertheless, it stuck as a way to describe a group of writers who turned in content from the more general exploration of universal middle class values characteristic of Nineteenth Century Realism to an obsession with questions of a more national nature. Their articles, essays, poems, and novels exploring Spanish history and geography carried existential overtones, expressing overall a sense of deep malaise at the social injustice, political bungling, and cultural indifference evident in contemporary Spanish society. Within a matter of years, these young authors had transformed their nation‚Äôs literary landscape. To be sure, established nineteenth century realists, such as Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, continued to write novels and theater into the second decade of the twentieth century, and, again in the case of Gald√≥s, were much admired by the new generation of writers. Nevertheless, with the novels of Unamuno, Azor√≠n, P√≠o Baroja, and Valle Incl√°n, the theater of the latter, and the poetry of Antonio Machado and Unamuno, a definitive literary shift had taken place‚Äîa shift in both form and content‚Äîpointing towards the more celebrated experimental writings of Spain's vanguard writers of the 1920s. Thanks to Azor√≠n's designation of his fellow writers as a ‚Äúgeneration\\", contemporary critics and later literary historians were to catalogue and then interpret the arrival of new batches of authors in such generational terms for nearly the next one hundred years. Certainly, the terminology possesses a certain organizational elegance and indeed, recognizes the significant impact of major political and cultural events on changing literary expressions and tastes (for example, the 1898 connection, or a 1927 literary celebration that briefly united nearly every major vanguard poet in Spain).  The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo  The next supposed ‚Äúgeneration\\" of Spanish writers following those of ¬¥98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914‚Äîthe year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset‚Äîa number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field. Leading voices include the poet Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, the academics and essayists Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Gregorio Mara√±on, Manuel Aza√±a, Eugeni d'Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Mir√≥, Ram√≥n P√©rez de Ayala, and Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of ¬¥98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. These writers had enjoyed more formal academic training than their predecessors, many taught within the walls of academia, and one, Aza√±a, was to become President and face of the Second Republic. Their genre of choice were the essay and the article, their arguments more systematic, and their tastes, more European. In contrast to Unamuno's existential obsessions or Machado's conceptual, earth-bound verse, Juan Ram√≥n's poetry pursued a more esoteric version of beauty and truth above all, while still manifesting an internalized sense of the existential dilemmas that plagued intellectuals in the first half of the twentieth century. Juan Ram√≥n was Spain's great modernist poet and the maestro of the coming vanguardist Generation of 1927. In 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Jos√© Ortega y Gasset became the spokesman for this and essential every generation of writers in the first half of the twentieth century. In essays like ‚ÄúMeditations on the Quijote,\\" ‚ÄúThe Rebellion of the Masses,\\" and most famously, ‚ÄúThe Dehumanization of Art,\\" Ortega laid out theories of art and society that lucidly explained and celebrated twentieth century vanguard experimentation while holding fast to an elitist social vision whose eclipse this art ironically expressed. The most elusive voice of this generation, and arguably, unclassifiable within this group was the novelist Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna who carried the narrative experiments of Unamuno and Valle Incl√°n to absurd extremes, such as in his 1923 novel, El novelista, where varieties of plays with narrative subjectivity result in chapters envisioned through the eyes and voice of street lamps. More approachable and enduring are G√≥mez de la Serna's ‚ÄúGreguer√≠as,\\" an original form of aphorism that he described as ‚Äúhumor plus metaphor.\\"  The Generation of 1927  Around 1920 a younger group of writers‚Äîmostly poets‚Äîbegan publishing works that from their beginnings revealed the extent to which younger artists were absorbing the literary experimentation of the writers of 1898 and 1914. Poets Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guill√©n, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Vicente Aleixandre, D√°maso Alonso, Manuel Altolaguirre were likewise the most closely tied to formal academia yet. Novelists such as Benjam√≠n Jarn√©s, Rosa Chacel, Francisco Ayala, and Ram√≥n J. Sender were equally experimental and academic. Many of this generation were full-time university professors, while others spent periods as guest teachers and students. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ‚ÄúRegeneracionistas\\" and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards. This group of poets continues to be, without contest, the most celebrated and studied of Spain's twentieth century writers. Their work provides a capstone to what some have called the ‚ÄúSilver Age\\" of Spanish Letters, a period that began with the veritable explosion of novel production following the bloodless coup of 1868 and that would come to a tragic end with the outbreak of civil war in July 1936. The writing of this supposed generation can be roughly divided into three moments. In their early years their work arises still out of mostly local and national traditions, culminating in their united celebration of the tri-centennial of the death of Golden Age poet Luis de G√≥ngora. From mid decade until the arrival of Spain's Second Republic in 1931, the Generation's poets reached the apex of their experimental writings, manifesting a clear awareness of the international vanguard ‚Äú‚Äîisms\\" sweeping major Western capitals of the day. After 1931, the Generation's writing increasingly displays the imprint of the political and social stresses that would lead to Spain's bloody civil war.  The Spanish Civil War  The Spanish Civil War, lasting from July 1936 to April 1939, had a devastating impact on the trajectory of Spanish letters. In July 1936, Spain was at the height of its Silver Age. Every major writer of the three major generations‚Äî1898, 1914, and 1927‚Äîwas still alive and productive. Those of 1914 and 1927 were at the height or just reaching the height of their literary powers. Several were recognized among Western civilization's most talented and influential writers. But by April 1939, Miguel de Unamuno, Antonio Machado, and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, among others, were dead. All but a small handful of the remaining writers had fled into exile, dispersed across the length of the American continent, most never to enjoy the close associations of conferences, tertulias, and theater premiers that had so often united them in pre-war Madrid. Among the handful of civil war poets and writers, Miguel Hern√°ndez stands out. A young disciple and associate of the Generation of 1898, Hern√°ndez, like Lorca, became a martyr to the Republican cause but this time as a post-war prisoner, fighting and writing as a soldier poet throughout the war and then languishing and dying in one of Franco's prisons in 1942. Among his important works, Perito en lunas (1933) from his pre-war surrealist days and Viento del pueblo (1937), evidence of the work of a soldier-poet, stand out.  Witnessing the early dictatorship (1939‚Äì1955)  The earliest years of the post-war were characterized more by hunger, repression, and suffering than by any significant literature. The published works of this period were true to pseudo-fascist dictator Francisco Franco's reactionary vision of a second Spanish golden age than to the material and existential anguish facing the majority of the country's population of the time. Neo-baroque poetry and paeans to Franco's Spain satisfied the censors but has enjoyed no subsequent critical shelf-life. Ironically, the narrative production of one of Franco's censors would provide the first sign of literary revival in post-war Spain. In 1942, Camilo Jos√© Cela's novel, La familia de Pascual Duarte, used just enough experimental arrangement (temporally disjointed narrative development to problematize simple accusations of political cause-effect critique; prefaces and post-scripts that confuse authorial intentions) to avoid the censors¬¥ cuts and to present to discerning Spanish readers an expos√© of a spiritually troubled, socially impoverished, and structurally violent society. Cela was to remain for the next five decades as one of Spain's most important novelists, eventually receiving the Nobel Prize for literature in 1989. With the 1945 publication of the Nadal Prize winning Nada by Carmen Laforet and the 1947 release of Miguel Delibes's La sombra del cipr√©s es alargada, readers of intelligent Spanish narrative at last had cause for hope. While the fresh, joyful experimentation of Spain's ‚ÄúSilver Age\\" writers had disappeared, Cela, Laforet, and Delibes at least showed a renewed commitment to a kind of writing that first, was connected to Spain's material reality, and second, would stretch itself aesthetically in its attempts to capture the experience. By the middle of the next decade, a whole new generation of novelists was latching onto the early models laid down by Cela and Laforet. Equally influenced by the films of the Italian neorealists, novelists such as Luis Romero (La noria, 1951), Rafael S√°nchez Ferlosio (El jarama, 1956), Jes√∫s Fern√°ndez Santos (Los bravos, 1956), Carmen Mart√≠n Gaite (Entre visillos, 1957), Ignacio Aldecoa (El fulgor y la sangre, 1954), and Juan Goytisolo (Juegos de manos, 1954) produced a social realist tradition that was as celebrated as it was short lived. Spanish poetry experienced renewal along similar lines. D√°maso Alonso's poem, ‚ÄúInsomnia\\" (1947) captures much of the angst and sense of violence that informed the works of Cela et al. and that would infuse the Spanish poetry of the era: Madrid es una ciudad de m√°s de un mill√≥n de cad√°veres (seg√∫n las √∫ltimas estad√≠sticas). A veces en la noche yo me revuelvo y me incorporo en este nicho en el que hace 45 a√±os que me pudro, y paso largas horas oyendo gemir al hurac√°n, o ladrar los perros, o fluir blandamente la luz de la luna. Y paso largas horas gimiendo como el hurac√°n, ladrando como un perro enfurecido, fluyendo como la leche de la ubre caliente de una gran vaca amarilla. Y paso largas horas pregunt√°ndole a Dios, pregunt√°ndole por qu√© se pudre lentamente mi alma, por qu√© se pudren m√°s de un mill√≥n de cad√°veres en esta ciudad de Madrid, por qu√© mil millones de cad√°veres se pudren lentamente en el mundo. Dime, ¬øqu√© huerto quieres abonar con nuestra podredumbre? ¬øTemes que se te sequen los grandes rosales del d√≠a, las tristes azucenas letales de tus noches? Poems by Jos√© Hierro, Blas de Otero, and Gabriel Celaya were more direct, penning poems with such transparent titles as ‚ÄúCanto a Espa√±a\\" (Hierro), ‚ÄúA la inmensa mayor√≠a\\" (Otero), or ‚ÄúLa poes√≠a es un arma cargada de futuro\\" (Celaya).  Economic and cultural renewal (1955‚Äì1975)  However, by the mid-1950s, just as with the novel, a new generation which had only experienced the Spanish civil war in childhood was coming of age. While still informed by the material social and political conditions of Spanish society, the works of √Ångel Gonz√°lez, Claudio Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© √Ångel Valente, Jos√© Agust√≠n Goytisolo, Francisco Brines, and Gloria Fuertes among others are less politically committed. Scholars differentiate these poets¬¥ social focus as one of communication of experience versus Hierro's and Celaya's representation of experience. That is, while these younger poets were still interested in talking about Spain, they were at least equally focused on the interactive processes of communication with the reader who was contemporaneously living these experiences. Rather than passively ingest the poet's vision of contemporary society, the poets of what came to be called variously the generation of 1956 or ‚Äúof the 1960s\\" produced poetry that engaged the reader in the interpretation if not the production of that vision. By the early 1960s, the brief social realist burst in narrative was already growing stale. Numerous novelists took a brief hiatus from writing. The general consensus as a new decade began was that the straightforward ‚Äúrealism\\" of the previous decade, while manifesting the brutal ‚Äútruth\\" of contemporary Spanish life under Franco, ultimately failed politically in that it directly modeled the very transparent discourse used so effectively by the authoritarian regime to crush the very opposition to which these writers aspired. Shaped in part by the French \\"nouveau roman\\" of writers like Alain Robbe-Grillet, the French \\"La Nouvelle Vague\\" cinema of Godard and Truffaut, and Latin American ‚ÄúBoom\\", Spanish novelists and poets, beginning perhaps with Luis Mart√≠n Santos's novel, Tiempo de silencio (1961), returned to the restless literary experimentation last seen in Spanish letters in the early 1930s. Among Spain's most celebrated ‚ÄúNew Novels\\" of this period, Juan Benet's Volver√°s a Regi√≥n (1967), Camilo Jos√© Cela's San Camilo, 36 (1969), Miguel Delibes's Cinco horas con Mario (1966), Juan Goytisolo's so called ‚ÄúTrilogy of Treason\\" consisting of Se√±as de identidad (1966), Reivindicaci√≥n del conde Don Juli√°n (1970), and Juan sin tierra (1975), Gonzalo Torrente Ballester's La saga/fuga de J.B. (1972), Juan Mars√©'s Si te dicen que ca√≠ (1973), and Luis Goytisolo's tetralogy Antagon√≠a (1973‚Äì1981) stand out. While arguably pulling Spanish narrative by the collar from the relative dark of social realism towards the aesthetic standards of Europe's most elite avant-garde, many of these novels proved almost unreadable to much of the public, a reality nicely embodied at the end of Juan Goytisolo's trilogy when an already deconstructed Spanish prose gradually transforms into an unreadable Arabic. The novel's experimentation was shadowed in Spanish poetry. Jos√© Mar√≠a Castellet's publication of Nueve nov√≠simos poetas espa√±oles recognized a group of artists whose works had similarly returned to early century experimentation. The works of Pere Gimferrer, Guillermo Carnero, and Leopoldo Panero, arguably the most important poets of the group, manifest a decidedly baroque style full of oblique cultural references, metapoetic devices, and other forms of extreme poetic self-consciousness spilling into the precious. Like the works of the New Novelists, this poetry was for a select group of readers, if not exclusive to the poets themselves.  Writing in the democracy (1975‚Äì1999)  When Franco at last died in November 1975, the important work of establishing democracy had an immediate impact on Spanish letters. Elitist narrative and poetry quickly gave way to narrative and poetry interested anew in not merely teaching (via content or style) but in delighting. Storytelling became the mantra for a new generation of Spanish novelists. Eduardo Mendoza's La verdad sobre el caso Savolta (1975) invited readers to escape to the roaring 1920s of Spain's pre-political, culturally vibrant Silver Age. While availing itself of various ‚ÄúNew Novel\\" experiments such as narrative fragmentation, the use of mixed media, and the presence of numerous often contradictory narrative voices, Mendoza's novel could be read and enjoyed as an adventure story with romantic and dramatic appeal. Carmen Mart√≠n Gaite's 1978 novel, El cuarto de atr√°s, was another manifestation of the happy melding of experiment with old- fashioned storytelling, pulling readers down through various narrative levels to explore dark memories of Spain's recent political past but with the light, ironic touch of a romance novel. Over the next several years a wealth of young new writers, among them Juan Jos√© Mill√°s, Rosa Montero, Javier Mar√≠as, Luis Mateo D√≠ez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Merino, F√©lix de Az√∫a, Cristina Fern√°ndez Cubas, Enrique Vila-Matas, Carme Riera, and later Antonio Mu√±oz Molina and Almudena Grandes, would begin carving out a prominent place for themselves within the Spanish cultural field. During the 1980s, Spanish narrative began appearing regularly on best seller lists for the first time since the pre-war era and many of this new generation became literary and cultural celebrities, living off their work as writers with all its blessing and curses, including the obligation to publish or perish. By the 1990s, the pressure to produce for the large publishing houses was clearly diminishing the early literary promise of some of these writers. On the other hand, some like Javier Mar√≠as, after publishing since the early 1970s, finally achieved international fame, appearing on best-seller lists throughout Europe. Mar√≠as's novels Coraz√≥n tan blanco (1992) and Ma√±ana en la batalla piensa en m√≠ (1994), and his ever- expanding experiment with real fiction (begun with 1989's Todas las almas and continued through weekly newspaper columns, 1998's Negra espalda del tiempo, and extended in his 21st century trilogy, Tu rostro ma√±ana), placed him on numerous critics¬¥ Nobel Prize shortlists. The big money available through novel publishing manifest itself in the 1990s in the explosion of literary prizes, awarded in Spain, unlike the UK's Man Booker or the U.S.¬¥s Pulitzer, to unpublished works. Literary prizes became little more than publicity opportunities. The long-standing Planeta and Nadal prizes, already media events, grew in importance and remuneration. They were joined during the decade by the Primavera, Alfaguara, and Lara Prizes, the return of the Caf√© Gij√≥n and the Biblioteca Breve prizes. Most carried large sums for the winners and guaranteed‚Äîoften obligated‚Äîlong international book tours. Into this economically charged mix stepped two new phenomena, the literary superstar and the literary celebrity. The former is almost entirely embodied by journalist turned novelist Arturo P√©rez Reverte who has managed to merit a certain critical acclaim while topping the sales charts with nearly every novel he writes. Many of his novels have been converted into popular films. A lesser figure as far as novel sales, but still important to the overall industry is the literary celebrity. These celebrities range from politically powerful figures like Antonio Mu√±oz Molina and Jon Juaristi to brief media flashes like Ray Loriga, Jos√© √Ångel Ma√±as, and Luc√≠a Etxchebarr√≠a. The latter three were the most representative members of the last of the twentieth century's supposed literary ‚Äúgenerations.\\" The ‚ÄúGeneraci√≥n X,\\" as critics dubbed them, brought black humor to a certain kind of post-political social realism focused principally on sex, drugs, rock-n-roll and the mental illness that accompanies it. These writers proved an excellent marketing phenomenon. That their works will endure is doubtful. New novelists whose work is more likely to endure that began publishing in this period include Rafael Chirbes, Bel√©n Gopegui, David Trueba, the Basques writers Bernardo Atxaga and √Ålvaro Bermejo, the Galician's Manuel Rivas and Suso de Toro among others. In the final decade of the 1990s, then, arguably five generations of writers‚Äîfrom Cela, to S√°nchez Ferlosio, to Mendoza, to Mu√±oz Molina, to the Generation X authors‚Äîwere sharing the expanding literary space of Spanish narrative. Notwithstanding the plethora of prize money that threatened to drown out quality with media- generated noise, the Spanish literary field at the end of the twentieth century was as promising as it had been since the 1920s.

She was launched on 2 October 1937, sponsored by Misses Ann and Mildred Stahlman and commissioned on 6 June 1938 with Captain William W. Wilson in command. Service history Nashville departed Philadelphia on 19 July 1938 for shakedown in the Caribbean. In early August, she sailed for Northern Europe on a good will visit, arriving at Cherbourg, France, on 24 August. Getting underway on 21 September from Portland, England, with $25,000,000 in British gold bullion aboard, Nashville arrived at Brooklyn Navy Yard on 30 September, off-loaded the gold, and returned to Philadelphia on 5 October. In the spring of 1939, Nashville carried American representatives to the Pan American Defense Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, returning them to Annapolis, Maryland, on 20 June 1939. On 23 June, she steamed westwards from Norfolk, Virginia, for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, arriving at San Pedro, California, on 16 July for two years of operations. In February 1941, she and three other cruisers carried US Marines to Wake Island. On 20 May, she departed Pearl Harbor for the east coast, arriving Boston on 19 June to escort a convoy carrying Marines to Iceland. World War II From August‚ÄìDecember 1941, Nashville was based at Bermuda for the Neutrality Patrol in the Central Atlantic. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Nashville steamed to Casco Bay, Maine, where she joined with a troop and cargo convoy to escort them to Iceland. She continued escort duty to Bermuda and Iceland until February 1942. Doolittle Raid On 4 March 1942, she rendezvoused with off the Virginia Capes, and then escorted the aircraft carrier to the West Coast via the Panama Canal, arriving on 20 March at San Diego. Hornet and Nashville steamed from San Francisco on 2 April, with the carrier laden with 16 Army B-25 Mitchell medium bombers on her flight deck, bombers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, USAAF, for the Doolittle Raid on Japan. On 13 April, they rendezvoused with other US Navy warships, under Vice Admiral William F. Halsey Jr., north of Midway Atoll, and then they set course for Japan. When about away from Japan on 17 April, the destroyers of the task force were detached due to lack of fuel, and then Nashville, the other escorting cruisers, and Hornet and made a high-speed dash to the air raid launching point from Japan. The next day, the task force was sighted by a Japanese picket boat, which reported the presence of the carrier task force before being sunk by scout planes from Enterprise. A second picket boat was then sunk by gunfire from Nashville, but the advantage of surprise was lost. The B‚Äì25s were launched short of the intended launching point in heavy seas. Immediately after the launch, the strike force reversed course and steamed eastwards for Honolulu. The \\"Shangri-La\\" task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 April. Flagship Nashville left Hawaii on 14 May 1942 to become the flagship of Task Force 8 (TF 8) defending Alaska and the Aleutians, and arrived at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on 26 May. She steamed for Kodiak, Alaska two days later to join with other units of the task force, including her sisters USS St Louis and USS Honolulu as well as two heavy cruisers and 6 destroyers. On 3‚Äì4 June, Japanese carrier planes struck Dutch Harbor. Nashville and her accompanying warships were unable to make contact with the enemy due to heavy fog. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto withdrew his diversionary force from the Aleutians after his defeat at the Battle of Midway. As the Japanese departed, they left occupying forces behind on Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutians. From June‚ÄìNovember, Nashville patrolled the North Pacific Ocean, and participated in the attack on Kiska on 7 August, in which heavy damage was inflicted on Japanese shore installations. Nashville arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 November and proceeded south to the Fiji Islands on 24 December. At Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, she became flagship of TF 67. After escorting troopships to Guadalcanal, Nashville, , and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese air base at Munda on the night of 4 January 1943. Subsequent attacks were made on Kolombangara and New Georgia in the next several months. While shelling Vila airfield on Kolombangara on the night of 12 May, she suffered a powder charge explosion in one of her forward turrets, killing 18 and injuring 17. Leaving Espiritu Santo on 22 May, Nashville arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for repairs and modernization. Departing from San Francisco on 6 August, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 August to join carrier task forces for strikes on Marcus Island and Wake Island during the next two months. Nashville returned to Espiritu Santo on 25 October and for the next seven months, she shelled targets on New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. Against the Japanese, Nashville provided fire support for the landings on Bougainville Island and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. After bombarding Wake Island on 21‚Äì22 April 1944, Nashville provided fire support and carried General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to the amphibious operations at Hollandia (present-day Jayapura), Tanahmerah Bay, and Aitape, on 22‚Äì23 April. On 27 May, the light cruiser was a member of the assault force shelling Biak, Schouten Islands, where on 4 June, she sustained moderate damage from a near miss while repelling a Japanese air attack. After repairs at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, Nashville twice more carried General MacArthur and his staff to the invasion of Morotai, Dutch East Indies in mid- September. She carried General MacArthur on his return to the Philippines, for which she sailed from Manus on 16 October. She provided fire support for the Leyte Island landings on 20 October, and she remained on station at the mouth of Leyte Gulf until 25 October, guarding the troops on the beachhead and the nearby transports. Returning to Manus Island for brief repairs, Nashville left the Admiralties on 28 November as the flagship for the Commander, Visayan Attack Force, en route to the invasion of Mindoro. Kamikaze attack Crew clean up Nashvilles port 5-inch gun battery after the kamikaze hit On 13 December, she was struck by a kamikaze off Negros Island. The aircraft crashed into her port 5 in/127mm gun mount, with both bombs exploding about 10 ft (3 m) off her deck. Gasoline fires and exploding ammunition made her midships area an inferno, but although 133 sailors were killed and 190 wounded, her remaining 5 in (127 mm) guns continued to provide anti-aircraft fire. The Attack Group Commander, Rear Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble, shifted his flag to , and Nashville steamed via San Pedro Bay in the Philippines and Pearl Harbor, Oahu, to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, arriving on 12 January 1945, for heavy repairs. Underway on 12 March, Nashville departed westward from San Diego, California, on 15 April after training exercises. Arriving at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, on 16 May, Nashville became the flagship of TF 74. The closing months of the war were spent providing fire support for the landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo, and protecting aircraft carriers in the Makassar Straits, Dutch East Indies. On 29 July, Nashville made a brief sortie from Subic to intercept a Japanese convoy reported off Indochina, but the sortie was soon canceled, ending her final wartime operation. Post-war USS Nashville CL-46, Oct. 1945, on Yangtze River Patrol, Whang-poo River, Shanghai, China, view from Whang-poo Pier Nashville, with Commander TF 73 (CTF 73) embarked, entered Shanghai harbor on 19 September 1945, to resume Yangtze River Patrol. CTF 73 hauled down his flag on 17 November, and Nashville sailed for the US West Coast with 450 returning soldiers, as part of Operation Magic Carpet. Picking up 90 more soldiers in Hawaii, she reached San Pedro, California, on 3 December, and then immediately steamed west to Eniwetok and Kwajalein to pick up more returning troops and Marines. Nearing the US West Coast on 3 January 1946, Nashville came to the aid of , laboring in heavy seas with engine breakdowns and 1,800 men aboard. The cruiser took St. Mary's in tow, pulling her to safety to the tugs at the San Francisco Lightship on 6 January 1946. Chilean Navy Nashville departed eastward from San Francisco on 21 January 1946, and she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a pre-inactivation overhaul. Decommissioned on 24 June, she remained in reserve until 1950. After an overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she was sold to Chile on 9 January 1951, and she served in the Chilean Navy as the Chilean cruiser Capit√°n Prat (CL-03) until the arrival of the Chilean destroyer Capit√°n Prat (1967) in 1982.

E. Hinton, first published in 1967 by Viking Press. Hinton was 15 when she started writing the novel but did most of the work when she was 16 and a junior in high school. Hinton was 18 when the book was published.Frequently Asked Questions at sehinton.com The book details the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class \\"greasers\\" and the upper-class \\"Socs\\" (pronounced ‚Äîshort for Socials). The story is told in first-person perspective by teenage protagonist Ponyboy Curtis. The story in the book takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965, but this is never explicitly stated in the book. A film adaptation was produced in 1983, and a short-lived television series appeared in 1990, picking up where the movie left off. A stage adaptation was written by Christopher Sergel and published in 1990. Plot summary Ponyboy Curtis, a teenaged member of a loose gang of \\"greasers\\", is leaving a movie theater when he is jumped by \\"Socs\\", the greasers' rival gang. Several greasers, including Ponyboy's two older brothers‚Äîthe paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop‚Äîcome to his rescue. The next night, Ponyboy and two greaser friends, the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny, meet Cherry and Marcia, a pair of Soc girls, at a drive-in movie theater. Cherry spurns Dally's rude advances, but Ponyboy ends up speaking civilly with Cherry, emotionally connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life. Afterward, Ponyboy, Johnny, and their wisecracking friend Two-Bit begin to walk Cherry and Marcia home, when they are stopped by Cherry's boyfriend Bob, who badly beat up Johnny a few months back. Bob and the greasers exchange taunts, but Cherry prevents a fight by willingly leaving with Bob. Ponyboy gets home at two in the morning, enraging Darry until he suddenly slaps Ponyboy. Pony runs out the door and meets up with Johnny, expressing his anger at Darry's increasing coldness in the wake of his parents' recent deaths in a car crash. Running away from home, Ponyboy and Johnny wander into a park, where Bob and four other Socs surround them. After some heated talk, Ponyboy spits at the Socs, prompting them to attempt to drown him in a nearby fountain, but Johnny stabs Bob, killing him and dispersing the rest. Terrified as to what to do next, Ponyboy and Johnny rush to find Dally, who gives them money and a loaded gun, directing them to hide in an abandoned church in Windrixville. During their stay there, Pony cuts and dyes his hair as a disguise, reads Gone with the Wind to Johnny, and, upon viewing a beautiful sunrise, recites the poem \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\" by Robert Frost. Days later, Dally comes to check on them, revealing that violence between the greasers and Socs has escalated since Bob's death into all-out city-wide warfare, with Cherry acting out of guilt as a spy for the greasers. Johnny decides to turn himself in and Dally agrees to take the boys back home. As they attempt to leave, they notice the church has caught fire and several local schoolchildren have become trapped inside. The greasers run inside the burning church to save the children, but Ponyboy is rendered unconscious by the fumes. At the hospital he discovers that he and Dally are not badly injured, but a piece of the church roof fell on Johnny and broke his back. Sodapop and Darry come to the hospital; Darry breaks down and cries. Ponyboy then realizes that Darry cares about him, and is only hard on him because he loves him and cares about his future. The following morning the newspapers declare Pony and Johnny heroes, but Johnny will be charged with manslaughter for Bob's death. Two-Bit tells them that the greaser-Soc rivalry is to be settled in a final rumble. Ponyboy and Two-Bit are approached by a Soc named Randy, Bob's best friend, who expresses remorse for his involvement in the gang war, lacks confidence about the rumble ending the feud, and says he will not participate. Later, Ponyboy visits Johnny at the hospital, where he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony spots Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after she explains herself they end on good terms. After escaping the hospital, Dally shows up just in time for the rumble. The greasers win the brutal fight. Afterward, Pony and Dally hurry back to the hospital to see Johnny, but he dies moments later and a maniacal Dally runs out of the room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to say that he has robbed a store and is running from the police. The greasers find Dally deliberately pointing an unloaded gun at the police, causing them to shoot and kill him. Overwhelmed, Ponyboy faints and is sick in bed for many days due to the resulting concussion from the rumble. When the hearing finally comes, the judge frees Ponyboy from responsibility for Bob's death and allows Pony to remain at home with Darry and Soda. Ponyboy returns to school, but his grades drop. Although he is failing English, his teacher, Mr. Syme, says he will pass him if he writes a decent theme. In the copy of Gone with the Wind that Johnny gave him before dying, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny describing how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire. Johnny also urges Ponyboy to \\"stay gold\\". Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: \\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home...\\" Major characters Greasers *Ponyboy Curtis: The narrator and the youngest Curtis brother, Ponyboy is 14 years old, and gets good grades and runs track.

Newport News was laid down 1 November 1945; launched on 6 March 1948 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia. The vessel was sponsored by Mrs. Homer L. Ferguson upon commissioning on 29 January 1949, Captain Floyd Smoot commanding. She was the first fully air-conditioned surface ship in the United States Navy,Commissioning (uss-newport-news.com) and the last of her age, as well as the last all-gun heavy cruiser in commission in US naval history. 1950‚Äì1962 In addition to annual deployments to the Mediterranean from 1950 to 1961 for duty with the Sixth Fleet, she participated in major fleet exercises and midshipman training cruises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. On 4 January 1956 the ship steamed for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean as flagship of Vice Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie, Commander Sixth Fleet.http://www.uss-newport-news.com/hist/1956.htm, accessed April 2012 Vice Admiral Ofstie was relieved on board by Vice Admiral Harry Donald Felt on 12 April in Barcelona, Spain. Commander Sixth Fleet transferred his flag to on 21 May at Gibraltar. The ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 29 May 1956. The ship visited the city of Newport News over the Fourth of July holiday, leaving Norfolk 2 July and returning 5 July. During the trip from Norfolk to Newport News, 250 dependents took part in the first dependents' cruise in the ship's history. From 16 July to 24 August, she participated in Midshipman Cruise Charlie as flagship of Commander Cruiser Division TWO. Visits were made at New Orleans, Louisiana, Balboa, Canal Zone, and Guantanamo Bay. While transiting the Panama Canal, Rear Admiral Ira H. Nunn relieved Rear Admiral E. R. McLean, Jr. as Commander Cruiser Division TWO. On 19 September she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul, remaining at Norfolk through December 1956. Commander Cruiser Division TWO transferred to on 20 September and his staff returned aboard on 1 November 1956. Newport News during operations in the Mediterranean in 1957. In early September 1957, Newport News was on station in the Eastern Mediterranean in preparation for any contingency during the Syrian crisis. In March 1960, while steaming 75 miles northeast of Sicily, Newport News was ordered to proceed to Agadir, Morocco, to render assistance to the survivors of that earthquake-shattered city. She steamed 1,225 miles in 40.5 hours at an average speed of 31 knots, arriving on 3 March to provide medical and material aid. With the assassination of General Rafael Trujillo and the resulting instability in Santo Domingo, Newport News was underway on short notice on 4 June 1961, and proceeded to a station in international waters off the Dominican Republic to await further orders. When the crisis terminated, the ship conducted training exercises off Puerto Rico before returning to Norfolk. Newport News transiting the Kiel Canal in September 1962. Newport News berthing and communications facilities were modified in the winter of 1962 to accommodate Commander United States Second Fleet and his staff. In August 1962, she participated in NATO Exercise RIPTIDE III, and upon the end of the exercise, made a month-long tour of Northern European ports as flagship of ComStrikFltLant, the NATO role of Commander Second Fleet. Within a month after return to Norfolk, Newport News was underway on 22 October as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with as her destroyer escort. The two ships stopped the Soviet vessel Labinsk and ordered her away from Cuban waters. For the next month, acting as flagship for ComSecondFlt, Newport News was on station northeast of Cuba.

Operations from 1963 through 1967 consisted primarily of NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, gunnery and amphibious exercises off the Eastern seaboard and Caribbean, and midshipman cruises. When the Dominican Republic crisis of 1965 developed, Newport News sortied from Norfolk on 29 April for Santo Domingo, where she was flagship for Commander Joint Task Force 122. Newport News remained on station off Santo Domingo until 7 May 1965 when JTF 122 was dissolved, and command was shifted to the Army ashore in the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk, where in June alterations were made to increase her combat capabilities. On 28 June 1965, Newport News entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Norfolk, Virginia for a five-month period of refitting and overhaul. Shakedown was in Guantanamo, Cuba, over Christmas and New Year of 1965. Upon her return from Gitmo, Newport News once again became Flagship for Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Masterson taking command. 1 September 1967, Commander Second Fleet shifted his flag to the light cruiser , and Newport News departed Norfolk 5 September for a six-month deployment to Southeast Asia where her firepower could be fully used. Arriving Da Nang, South Vietnam, on the morning of 9 October, she became the flagship of ComCruDesFlot 3. That night, at 2300, she fired her eight-inch rifles for the first time in anger against shore targets in North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon. Newport News spent some 50 days patrolling the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon ‚Äì the Navy's effort to destroy waterborne logistics craft as well as military supply routes and installations ashore in North Vietnam. During this period, the ship conducted 156 strikes against enemy targets and, in the execution of these strikes, 325 North Vietnamese coastal defense sites were taken under fire. According to spotters‚Äô reports, Newport News sank 17 waterborne logistics craft, damaged another 14 and destroyed several enemy bunker and radar sites, bridges, barges, trucks and roads. The ship was subjected to hostile fire on several occasions, but each time countered effectively and silenced the enemy batteries. On 19 December 1967, Newport News exchanged fire with 20‚Äì28 separate shore batteries, simultaneously, off the coast of North Vietnam. During the short period of this engagement, over 300 enemy rounds bracketed the cruiser's position, but she suffered no direct hits. This encounter led American forward observers to nickname Newport News \\"The Gray Ghost from the East Coast,\\" a moniker she retained throughout her three Vietnam deployments.Thunder goes to War USS Newport News firing a broadside during her 1972 Vietnam deployment. Subsequent to the end of Operation Sea Dragon and for the remaining several months of this deployment, Newport News participated in Naval Gunfire Support operations near the DMZ. In support of Third Marine Division forces on the coastal area, the ship fired around the clock for periods sometimes lasting several weeks in succession. During the total period of this deployment, Newport News expended a record 59,241 rounds of high- explosive ammunition, while conducting a total of 239 observed and 602 unobserved missions against the enemy. She came under fire of enemy coastal defense batteries on seventeen separate occasions, was frequently strafed with shrapnel, but never suffered a direct hit. The cruiser departed Subic Bay on 21 April and arrived at her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1968, via the Panama Canal. Following an extensive yard overhaul period to prepare her for further combat operations, on 21 November 1968 Newport News once again departed Norfolk to commence her second deployment to Vietnam. Combat operations during this second tour commenced on 25 December 1968, focused primarily on providing naval gunfire support to the 7th and 9th ARVN in Vƒ©nh B√¨nh province and the DMZ. Newport News departed Da Nang on 3 June 1969, via San Francisco and the Panama Canal, to arrive at her homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, in early July of that year. In May 1972, Newport News returned for her third and last combat tour. During the summer of 1972 the ship, along with the guided missile cruisers and , as well as several screening destroyers, took part in a high-speed night bombardment of Haiphong harbor. Known as Operation Custom Tailor, it was the last time in naval history a major shore bombardment would be undertaken by multiple cruisers. On 1 October 1972, while in action off the Demilitarized Zone, Newport News sustained an in-bore explosion in her center 8-inch gun of number two turret. A defective auxiliary detonating fuze caused the projectile to detonate almost immediately upon firing. Nineteen men were killed and ten injured. The barrel proper was blown forward from the gun. The damaged gun was removed and its port plated over. The explosion had caused extensive damage to the center gun mount. It was proposed to replace the damaged mount with one from Des Moines (CA-134) or Salem (CA-139), both of which had been decommissioned, but this was rejected as being too expensive. As a result, the damage was not repaired and the turret was simply closed off for the remainder of the ship's career. Operations near Vietnam continued until December 1972 when the ship was recalled to Norfolk. During 1973 and 1974 the ship undertook training cruises and visited many ports around the world before being recalled for decommissioning. While there was some interest in retaining her \\"big-gun\\" capability in the fleet, a survey to determine further service indicated the ship was beyond economical refitting. Modifications During her career Newport News underwent several refits which changed her appearance somewhat, and increased her capabilities. During the mid-1950s her forward bridge was enclosed on both levels with roofs and glass windows creating a navigation bridge above, and a flag bridge below. Later in the 1950s new and more capable radars for navigation and gunnery were fitted. The biggest change for her came in 1962 when a large deck-house was added midships which gave her enhanced flagship accommodation and office spaces. This would result in her becoming the United States Second Fleet flagship for most of the rest of her career, save for her gunfire support stints during the Vietnam War. Decommissioning Newport News in New Orleans, 1993, just before being scrapped. Newport News was decommissioned on 27 June 1975 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978.

Seifert's Drapers' Gardens Drapers Gardens skyscraper in 1983 The original Drapers Gardens was a skyscraper in the City of London, designed by architect Richard Seifert. It stood at tall and had 30 storeys. It was completed in 1967 and demolished in 2007 by Keltbray. After completion, the building was leased by the National Provincial Bank and continued to be used by the successor National Westminster Bank until the 1990s. It was used as overflow office space for the bank's nearby Head Office at 41 Lothbury. When viewed from Waterloo Bridge (as in the photograph below), Drapers Gardens appeared as the closest office tower to St Paul's Cathedral. Conversely, there were those who cited the building as a fine example of its period and one of the few genuinely well-designed towers of the 1960s. Richard Seifert, its designer as well as the architect of Tower 42, described the Drapers Gardens skyscraper as his proudest achievement. When the tower was demolished in 2007, it was the tallest building to have ever been demolished in the United Kingdom. As of 2018, it remains the joint- tallest demolished building in the country, alongside the subsequent Southwark Towers, demolished the year after Drapers' Gardens.

Early life Born in Islington, the son of distinguished neurologist Macdonald Critchley, CBE (1900‚Äì1997) and his first wife, midwife Edna Audleth (n√©e Morris), Critchley was brought up in Swiss Cottage, North London, and in Shropshire, where he attended Brockhurst School, a preparatory school in Church Stretton, and later Shrewsbury School. He returned to London to take his Higher Certificate and was rejected from National Service after contracting polio. After a year living and studying at the Sorbonne in Paris he went up in 1951 to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. In 1953 he was part of a team of Oxford undergraduates lobbying Vickers shipyard workers against nationalisation; the others were Michael Heseltine, Guy Arnold and Martin Morton.Oxford men speak at Shipyard, Barrow-in-Furness Mail, c.1953. Archive of Guy Arnold Political career Critchley served as a Conservative Member of Parliament, first for Rochester and Chatham from 1959 to 1964 and then for Aldershot from 1970 until his retirement in 1997. While he was out of Parliament between 1964 and 1970 he worked as a journalist, including as a TV critic for The Times, and he continued to be active as a journalist and author throughout the remainder of his career. Having lost Rochester and Chatham in 1964, he stood again for the seat in 1966 election, but was once again defeated by the Labour candidate Anne Kerr. Critchley was considered to be on the left wing of the Conservative Party (one of the \\"wets\\" in Thatcherite terminology) and never attained ministerial rank. He became identified as a prominent Tory critic of Margaret Thatcher. In 1980 he sparked controversy by writing an anonymous article in The Observer signed \\"by a Tory\\", in which he criticised Thatcher's \\"A level economics\\" and called her \\"didactic, tart and obstinate\\". He was later forced to admit authorship. He also memorably referred to Thatcher as \\"the great she-elephant\\" and claimed responsibility for the currency of the phrase \\"one of us\\", which she used privately to refer to any colleague whom she saw as loyal and supportive of her policies. (It was used by Hugo Young as the title of his biography of Thatcher.) Critchley was, however, supportive of Thatcher's stance at the time of the Falklands War. Critchley was a long-standing friend of Michael Heseltine, having met him first at preparatory school. Both then went on to Shrewsbury and Pembroke College, Oxford, and Critchley was best man at Heseltine's wedding. Their friendship waned in the 1960s, but Critchley still supported Heseltine in the 1990 leadership election. From the early 1990s Critchley became severely restricted in mobility from complications arising from the polio from which he had suffered as a young man. Still, he successfully re-contested Aldershot at the election in 1992. He then became an infrequent attender at the House of Commons until his retirement in 1997. He was knighted in 1995. Later life After his retirement he was expelled from the mainstream Conservative party for backing the Pro-Euro Conservative Party in the 1999 European Parliament election. He died the next year in Hereford from prostate cancer aged 69. He was married twice, and had four children. In later life he settled in Shropshire at Ludlow, and was buried in the parish churchyard at Wistanstow near Craven Arms. Critchley became highly regarded as a witty and acerbic political writer and journalist, increasingly so towards the end of his life. His 1994 volume of memoirs, A Bag of Boiled Sweets, was described by Jeremy Paxman as \\"the most entertaining set of political memoirs to have been published in years\\". He also wrote two mystery novels set in Parliament, Hung Parliament and Floating Voter, which feature an MP turned sleuth apparently based on Critchley himself along with a mixture of real and invented MPs, the latter providing the victims and suspects.

Background The Wahhabi movement is a reformist revivalist movement within Islam founded by Muhammad ibn Abd-al- Wahhab that would lead to creation of the Emirate of Diriyah as he and Muhammad bin Saud launched their campaign to reform Islam and consolidate power in Arabia from their power-base, and its eventual crushing by the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian khedive Muhammad Ali of Egypt. In 1802, 12,000 Wahhabis sacked Karbala in Iraq killing up to 5,000 people and plundering the Imam Husayn Shrine. By 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. The Wahhabis also attacked Ottoman trade caravans which interrupted the Ottoman finances.Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid-Marsot. A History of Egypt From the Islamic Conquest to the Present.

(Text online at JSTOR) and the Ottoman Empire, suspicious of the ambitious Muhammad Ali, instructed him to fight the Wahhabis, as the defeat of either would be beneficial to them. Tensions between Muhammad Ali and his Albanian troops also prompted him to send them to Arabia and fight against the Wahhabi movement where many died. Campaigns Painting of Abdullah bin Saud, convicted and executed after losing the war. Muhammad Ali was ordered to crush the Saudi state as early as December 1807 by Sultan Mustafa IV, however internal strife within Egypt prevented him from giving full attention to the Wahhabis. The Albanians were not able to recapture the holy cities until 1811. In 1815, one of the main rebels, Bakhroush bin Alass of Zahran tribe, was killed and beheaded by Muhammad Ali forces in Al Qunfudhah. In 1817, Ibrahim Pasha, Muhammad Ali's son, had taken over the campaign, gaining support of the volatile Arabian tribes by skillful diplomacy and lavish gifts, he advanced into central Arabia to occupy the towns of Unaizah and Buraidah. He was then joined by most of the principal tribes and marched to the Saudi capital Diriyah. However, their march to Diriyah was plagued by Wahhabi attacks when they arrived in Diriyah in April 1818. It took until September for the Wahhabis to surrender, in part due to Ibrahim's poorly trained army. Diriyah was destroyed in June 1819 and Egyptian garrisons were posted in the principal towns. It was not until September 1818 that the Wahhabi state ended with the surrendering of its leaders and the head of the Wahhabi state, Abdullah bin Saud, who was sent to Istanbul to be executed. Aftermath Most of the political leaders were treated well but the Ottomans were far harsher with the religious leaders that inspired the Salafi movement, executing Sulayman ibn Abd Allah and other religious notables, as they were thought to be uncompromising in their beliefs and therefore a much bigger threat than political leaders. The execution also reflects the Ottoman resentment of the Wahhabist views. This war had formed the basic hatred against the Wahhabi ideology among the Ottomans, and it continued to influence even modern Turkey when Turkish Islamic preachers consider Wahhabism to be non-Islam; virtually the whole Turkish population is anti-Wahhabism. For the Saudis, who would form the nation a century later, the Saudis considered it as the first struggle for independence from the oppressive Ottoman Empire, and the current state of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Turkey is still influenced by this hostile past, whereas systematic campaign by the Saudis to rewrite the Ottoman past was denounced in Turkey.https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/turkophobia-is- behind-the-saudi-washing-of-ottoman- history-29545https://ahvalnews.com/turkish-dramas/saudis-mbc-launching-new- drama-series-exposing-ottoman-tyranny  See also  * Fitnat al-Wahhabiyya * Nejd Expedition * Hadith of Najd * Saudi Arabia‚ÄìTurkey relations  References  Category:19th century in Saudi Arabia Category:Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty Category:History of Nejd Category:Military campaigns involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Wars involving Saudi Arabia Category:Wars involving the Ottoman Empire Category:1810s in Egypt Category:1810s in Asia Category:Religion-based wars ","title":"Wahhabi War"},{"id":"562496","text":"Le Lieu is a municipality in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland, located in the district of Jura-Nord Vaudois in the Vall√©e de Joux.

She was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California, on 15 July 1940; launched on 23 October 1942; sponsored by Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, president of Mills College, Oakland, California; and commissioned on 17 July 1943, Captain William K. Phillips in command. She was named for the city of Oakland, California. Like the Atlanta class, the Oakland class was designed as an anti-aircraft cruiser, with a main battery of dual-purpose guns, the principal difference between the two classes being that the Oakland-class did not have the Atlanta class's two-beam twin 5 in (127 mm)/38 cal gun turrets. They were removed for the sake of stability and the limited arcs of fire experienced by the wing turrets on the Atlantas. Oakland sustained three casualties during World War II.  Service history   World War II   1943  Following a shakedown and training cruise off San Diego in the summer of 1943, Oakland sailed back to Pearl Harbor arriving on 3 November. Joining with three heavy cruisers and two destroyers, she linked up with Task Group 50.3 (TG 50.3) near Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, for support of Operation Galvanic, the amphibious push into the Gilbert Islands. The carriers launched initial air strikes on 19 November, and in retaliation, a wave of Japanese torpedo bombers attacked the formation on the afternoon of the 20th. Oakland scored two kills and two assists in fighting off the raiders. On 26 November, northeast of the Marshall Islands, Oakland again fought off strong coordinated torpedo plane attacks. At 2332 on 4 December, a torpedo tore into the side of , damaging steering control and Oakland covered her slow withdrawal, arriving Pearl Harbor on 9 December.  1944  Oakland departed Pearl Harbor on 16 January 1944 with the carriers of TG 58.1 headed for the Marshall Islands. The task group launched strikes against Maloelap on 29 January and against Kwajalein on the 30th. An amphibious assault was made on Kwajalein on 1 February. Oakland with her carriers supported American operations ashore until they entered Majuro Lagoon on 4 February. Weighing anchor on 12 February, the ships of TG 58.1 sailed from Majuro and launched air strikes against Truk on 16‚Äì17 February, greatly damaging the important Japanese naval base there. Then, despite a night-long series of Japanese aerial attacks on 21‚Äì22 February, to hit the Marianas with damaging blows, Oaklands gunners bagged two more enemy planes and assisted in splashing two others before returning to Majuro. Oakland sortied with TG 58.1 on 7 March, bound for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. The group skirted the Solomons and covered the occupation of Emirau Island, north of New Britain, on the 20th. On the 27th, the task group swept on to the western Carolines. Heavy air attacks greeted the carriers, but Oakland and her partners in the screen fought them off before any damage was incurred. They pounded Palau on 30 March, Yap on the 31st and Woleai on 1 April, before returning to Majuro on 6 April. Through April the group carried out similar operations at Wake Island and Samar. They again hammered Truk on the 29th-30th, as well as hitting Satawan on the later date. Allied surface and aerial bombardment battered Ponape on 1 May, before Oakland retired to Kwajalein on 4 May. Following anti- aircraft training, Oakland helped to attack Guam on 11 June, then steamed north to hit the Volcano and Bonin Islands by the 14th. West of the embattled Marianas, Task Force 58 (TF 58) sped to intercept a large Japanese surface force approaching from the Philippines. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, the famed \\"Turkey Shoot\\" took place as US planes decimated the trained air groups of three Japanese carrier divisions, almost eliminating Japanese naval aviation. Toward the end of the battle, as darkness was creeping in, the returning American pilots were scanning the sea for their carriers. Admiral Mitscher, on the bridge of his flagship, concerned about his men, gave the order \\"Turn on the lights.\\" In response, Oaklands searchlights were turned on, helping to light up the Philippine Sea. TG 58.1 next struck at Pagan Island on 23 June and Iwo Jima the next day. On the 27th, the units gathered at Eniwetok Atoll for replenishment, and on the 30th nosed northwest to the Bonin Islands. The group delivered a withering air-sea bombardment against Iwo and Chichi Jima on 3‚Äì4 July, and by the 5th was speeding south for a return engagement in the Marianas. On 7 July, the carriers began launching a series of alternating strikes against Guam and Rota. Oakland and teamed up to recover downed pilots off Guam, and fired at targets on Orote Peninsula. At 0800 on 4 August, search planes reported a Japanese convoy zig-zagging out of Chichi Jima Bonin Islands. Two hours later, the carriers' planes reported they were attacking enemy vessels. An attack group was quickly formed, consisting of Oakland, , and , and Destroyer Division 91. Detached from the task group at 1241, the killer band raced at between Ototo and Yome Jima and arrived on the scene at about 1730. The destroyers formed an attack group ahead of the cruisers and, at 1845, sank a small oiler. Another straggler from the convoy, later identified as the destroyer Matsu, was sighted at 1924 and subsequently sunk. At 2145, Oakland and company contacted a 7500-ton supply ship and sank her, before turning south to rake Chichi Jima. Oakland made three runs shelling shipping in Chichi's harbor of Funtami Ko, and helped to silence a shore battery before she retired at 1119 on 5 August. Several Japanese ships had been sunk, a seaplane base damaged, and fires started among the wharves and warehouses. From 6‚Äì8 September, Oaklands task group hit the Palau Islands, Peleliu being the main target. On the evening of the 8th, they steamed west to raid enemy airfields in the Philippines through the 22nd. On 6 October, Oakland departed Ulithi shepherding her own carriers toward the Ryukyu Islands and hit Okinawa on the 10th. They attacked installations on Formosa and the Pescadores on 12 October and, at 1835, as they were withdrawing, fought off Japanese air counterattack. They hit Formosa again on 13 October, and again the Imperial Air Force lashed out in full fury as the task force withdrew at nightfall. Oakland assisted in turning back the aerial opponents but, at 1835, in TG 38.1 was damaged by a torpedo, and on the 14th received a torpedo hit. Oakland then covered the withdrawal of the two hit ships, before participating in the strikes against Luzon from 17‚Äì19 October and supporting the landings on Leyte the 20th. En route to Ulithi on the 24th, Oakland received orders to backtrack at once to help stop the Japanese Fleet which was converging on Leyte Gulf. By the time she arrived on the scene, the enemy had been repulsed, and the carriers began long range strikes against the retreating enemy. The Battle for Leyte Gulf was essentially the end of the Imperial Navy as an effective fighting force. From November‚ÄìDecember, Oakland operated with various task groups of TF 38 supporting the Philippine liberation campaign. On 18 December, she rode out a raging typhoon in the Philippine Sea escaping serious damage.  1945  Oakland returned to San Francisco on 11 January 1945. She remained for repairs and trial runs until sailing for Hawaii on 4 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on the 9th, Oakland began additional training south of Oahu. She received movement orders on the 14th and sailed for Ulithi, the staging area for Okinawa. Reaching Ulithi on 30 March, she sailed again with other units the following day. On tap was the most ambitious amphibious assault of the Pacific war. On 2 April, the group separated, Oakland going ahead to join TG 58.4. For five days, she engaged in hitting Sakashima Gunto in the southern Nansei Shoto and then proceeded to Okinawa. On 10 April, Oakland was reassigned to TG 58.3 for the remainder of the Okinawa campaign. She came under air attack again on 11 April with her gunners splashing a dive bomber. With other groups of TF 58, Oakland moved northward on 15 April to launch strikes against airfields at Ky≈´sh≈´. Enemy planes tried time and again to pierce the task force's protective fighter umbrella. Twice Oaklands guns opened up, aiding in the destruction of one \\"Frances\\" and driving off another. Okinawan defenses were struck again on the 17th. Kamikazes evaded the combat air patrol in the morning and Oakland took two under fire as they passed over the ship. Both were dropped within the formation, with Oakland scoring one. On the 29th, Oakland drove away another enemy aircraft. TG 58.3 had taken the best the Imperial Air Force had to offer during 11 days of April. The rest of the month was utilized in making additional strikes against Okinawa and conducting gunnery exercises with drones and towed sleeves. Snooper planes began winging near the group early in the morning on 11 May. After breakfast, the Oakland crew scrambled to General Quarters but an attack failed to materialize at that time. Two kamikazes plummeted into the flight deck of from the cruiser. A trio of life rafts were cut loose from Oakland to aid in the rescue of Bunker Hill survivors sighted ahead. The task force struck again at airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´ on 13 May. On the 14th, the Japanese reciprocated. Shortly after breakfast, a lone Zero was spotted circling through the clouds and Oaklands guns quickly opened fire, but their quarry just as quickly disappeared from view. Then he came back like a comet. bore the brunt of his crash-dive as he blew up in a blossom of flame on her flight deck. Shortly, a flock of kamikazes appeared, and within the space of 15 minutes, Oakland took four separate kamikazes under fire. Oaklands claim of two assists was substantiated by the task group commander. For the duration of May, Oakland remained with the task group off Okinawa. On the 29th she shifted back to TG 38.1 under Admiral Halsey and made for Leyte Gulf, anchoring in San Pedro Bay on 1 June. On 10 July, TG 38.1 commenced raids on the Japanese mainland beginning with Honsh≈´ and then thundering north to Hokkaid≈ç. From 17‚Äì20 July, Oakland participated in strikes against Tokyo and 24‚Äì27 July against Kure and Kobe. Tokyo was hit again on the 30th along with Nagoya. On 7 August, the ships turned north to strike the Honsh≈´-Hokkaido area for a second time. 15 August brought the long-awaited \\"cease all offensive operations\\" order. Oakland then proceeded to her assigned operating area for the occupation of Japan. She moved to Tokyo Bay on 30 August and, while anchored near the Yokosuka Naval Base. Berthed several thousand yards away from , Oakland provided a box seat for her sailors to witness the unforgettable climax to their war.  Post-war  While Oakland lay at anchor in Tokyo Bay on the night of 27 September, a typhoon swept close to the harbor entrance. A tanker dragged anchor and struck Oaklands bow, causing minor damage. On 1 October, Oakland sailed for Okinawa to embark homeward bound veterans for a \\"magic carpet\\" voyage to San Francisco. Leaving Okinawa on 3 October, she arrived at San Francisco on 20 October. Navy Day (27 October) observances at Oakland, California, were highlighted by the presence of Oakland. \\"Magic carpet\\" duty in November and December took Oakland back to the Pacific twice, first to Eniwetok and then to Kwajalein. At the year's end, the Navy turned the task of bringing home the veterans solely over to its transportation service, and Oakland was ordered to an inactivation area at Bremerton, Washington. Reprieve came in the form of a change in orders and, instead of inactivation, Oakland was slated to continue as an active postwar fleet unit. A thorough overhaul was afforded her at the Puget Sound Navy Yard to erase the effects of long months of battle. On 6 January 1947, Oakland got underway for her first post- war cruise to the Far East. After a stop at Pearl Harbor on the 14th, the light cruiser conducted a two-month fleet exercise in the Marianas and Marshall Islands, visiting Guam, Saipan and Kwajalein before returning to Pearl Harbor on 11 March. Instead of returning to San Diego, however, Oakland was ordered east to China, where American support for the Nationalist Chinese in the Civil War against the communist Chinese was growing following the collapse of mediation efforts. Arriving at Tsing-tao on 30 March, Oakland became the flagship of Capt. Sherman R. Clark, commander, Destroyer Flotilla Three. The light cruiser operated out of that port and Shanghai, for the next three months, conducting almost a dozen patrols in the East China Sea. Tensions were particularly high in May, as communist forces threatened the U.S. consulate at Peking, and American forces in China were placed on high alert. As part of that response, Oakland supplied a small landing force of sailors to help out the Marines in Tsing-tao. Tensions eased in June and the light cruiser departed China on 20 July, stopping at Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor before arriving at San Diego on 8 August. On 18 March, Oakland was reclassified CLAA-95. On 1 July 1949, Oakland decommissioned at San Francisco. Struck on 1 March 1959, she was sold to Louis Simons on 1 December for scrapping. Scrapping was completed by the end of 1962. Oaklands mast and nameplate were restored and given to the city of Oakland. In July 2002, they were installed in the Port of Oakland's Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, on the western waterfront, at the site of the former Fleet and Industrial Supply Center.

These anonymous stories were mostly cantar de gesta. Although versified to make it easier to memorize, juglares probably often changed the story a little bit as they passed it to others. There are more theories regarding the origin of these texts. The individualist theory states that these texts were the creation of one poet and they didn't change much. On the other hand, the traditionalist theory says that it is a collective work of the public and it was totally changed on its route.

Georgia politicians sold large tracts of territory in the Yazoo lands, in what are now portions of the present-day states Alabama and Mississippi, to political insiders at very low prices in 1794. Although the law enabling the sales was overturned by reformers the following year, its ability to do so was challenged in the courts, eventually reaching the US Supreme Court. In the landmark decision in Fletcher v. Peck (1810), the Court ruled that the contracts were binding and the state could not retroactively invalidate the earlier land sales. It was one of the first times the Supreme Court had overturned a state law, and it justified many claims for those lands. Some of the land sold by the state in 1794 had been shortly thereafter resold to innocent third parties, greatly complicating the litigation. In 1802, because of the ongoing controversy, Georgia ceded all of its claims to lands west of its modern border to the U.S. government. In exchange the government paid cash and assumed the legal liabilities. Claims involving the land purchases were not fully resolved until legislation was passed in 1814 established a claims-resolution fund. The Yazoo land fraud is often conflated with the Pine Barrens speculation, another land scandal that took place in east Georgia at about the same time. In this case, the state's high-ranking officials were making multiple gifts of land grants for the same parcels, resulting in the issuance of grants totaling much more land than was available in the state of Georgia. Background The origins of the Yazoo land scandal lay in the desire of the U.S. state of Georgia to firm up its territorial claims after the American Revolutionary War, and to satisfy a great demand for land to develop. The territory claimed by Georgia ran as far west as the Mississippi River, and included most of the present states of Alabama and Mississippi (from 31¬∞ N to 35¬∞ N, excepting only the coastal areas of those states). Some of this territory was claimed and occupied by Native Americans, and southern portions of the territory were also claimed by Spain as part of Spanish Florida. Lands along the Mississippi River near present-day Natchez, Mississippi had been settled during the British administration of West Florida, and had a strong Loyalist presence. Some Georgia authorities and speculators thought these developed lands could be seized. Previous development attempts The State of Franklin (in red) superimposed on a map of modern Tennessee The first attempt of Georgia to organize settlement in this area was a 1784 proposal to establish Houstoun County in the Muscle Shoals area. This attempt never got off the ground because its major proponents became involved instead in an effort to establish the State of Franklin in present-day eastern Tennessee. In 1785 Governor George Mathews signed the Bourbon County Act, which organized Bourbon County, Georgia in the area east of the Mississippi and south of the Yazoo River. This area included the Natchez area and was in the area also claimed by Spain. The state appointed civil and judicial officers for the new county, but under pressure from the federal government, Georgia dissolved Bourbon County in 1788. The federal government opposed Bourbon County because of the unresolved Spanish claim, and because claims to the area by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Native American tribes had not been extinguished. Map of the American Deep south, showing the three areas which constituted the 1789 Yazoo land scandal. In about 1789, a secret society called the Combined Society was formed; the members' sole purpose was to make money by land speculation. This group secured influence in the Georgia legislature to further its aims. In 1789 three companies, The South Carolina Yazoo Company, The Virginia Yazoo Company (which was headed by Patrick Henry), and the Tennessee Company were formed by Combined Society interests to buy land from the Georgia legislature. Governor Edward Telfair signed a deal to sell of land to the Yazoo companies for $207,000, or about 1 cent per acre. These lands were located north of the mouth of the Yazoo River and extended eastward from the Mississippi. The deal fell through in 1792 when the companies sought to pay with depreciated old currency, which the state refused to accept. The existence of the Combined Society was also exposed in 1792; some of its principals continued to be active in attempts to develop Georgia lands. Yazoo land sales In 1794, four new companies were formed: the Georgia Company, the Georgia-Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the new Tennessee Company. Their principals included individuals active in the 1789 purchases, as well as leading Georgia politicians such as James Gunn and United States Supreme Court Associate Justice James Wilson. These companies persuaded the Georgia state assembly to sell more than of land for $500,000. Many Georgia officials and legislators were offered shares in these companies or bribes to secure their agreement to the sale. On January 7, 1795, Governor Mathews signed into law a bill authorizing the sale of the , known as the Yazoo Act. The territory that was the subject of these purchases included most of the land that had been the subject of the 1789 purchase attempt, and a significant portion of it was resold to buyers in other parts of the country who were not aware of the shaky nature of the transactions. Repeal of sale When the details of the sale were revealed, public outrage was widespread, and people protested to federal officials and Congressmen. Jared Irwin and U.S. Senator James Jackson led the reform efforts: Irwin was elected Governor of Georgia and, less than two months after taking office, signed a bill on February 13, 1796 nullifying the Yazoo Act. The state burned all copies of the bill except for one that had been sent to President George Washington. Jackson resigned as Senator to run for office as next Governor of Georgia. He was elected and took office two years later. But the matter was not over. The state refunded money to people who had purchased land, but some refused the money, preferring to keep the land. The state did not recognize their claims, and the matter was to wind through courts for the next decade. In 1802 the state ceded to the federal government all claim to lands west of its present border (which were organized into the Mississippi Territory), along with the ongoing legal disputes. Claims by third-party owners who had innocently purchased land from the original companies were not fully resolved until 1816. Spanish claims to the Georgia territory were resolved with the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo; Native American claims to the area were extinguished by a series of treaties ending in the 1820s. Legal challenges to Georgia's attempt to repeal the sale reached the Supreme Court in 1810. The landmark Fletcher v. Peck decision marked one of the first times the Court overturned a state law, deciding that the land sales were binding contracts and could not be retroactively invalidated by the passage of superseding legislation. Pine Barrens speculation During the same period, in what was called the Pine Barrens speculation, the governors and legislature of Georgia made overlapping land grants in the eastern part of the state, effectively granting three times more land than existed in the state. Although land grants were supposed to be limited to per individual, the state awarded multiple grants of to certain people.

He was one of the first scholars to recognise prehistoric stone tools as human-made rather than natural or mythologically created thunderstones. Biography Mercati was born in San Miniato, Tuscany, the son of Pietro Mercati, physician to Popes Pius V and Gregory XIII. He was educated at the University of Pisa, where he took degrees in medicine and philosophy. He was interested in natural history, mineralogy, palaeontology, medicine, and botany, and produced a book on these subjects entitled the Metallotheca, which was not published until 1717. Mercati collected curious objects - fossils, minerals and so on - as well as 'ceraunia' or 'thunderstones'. Mercati was particularly interested in Ceraunia cuneata, \\"wedge-shaped thunderstones,\\" which seemed to him to be most like axes and arrowheads, which he now called ceraunia vulgaris, \\"folk thunderstones,\\" distinguishing his view from the popular one. Mercati examined the surfaces of the ceraunia and noted that the stones were of flint and that they had been chipped all over by another stone. By their shapes, Mercati deduced that the stones were intended to be hafted. He then showed the similarities between the 'ceraunia' and artifacts from the New World that explorers had identified as implements or weapons. Mercati posited that these stone tools must have been used when metal was unknown and cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the Three-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based on the use of stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Legacy Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently by other antiquarians, however, his writing served as a further stimulus. He was lauded shortly after publication by Antoine de Jussieu and his importance continues to be recognised. David Clarke described Mercati as \\"the archaeological counterpart of Cardano in mathematics, Vesalius in anatomy, Galileo in the physical sciences and Copernicus in astronomy.\\" External links *Michele Mercati *Wunderkammer His cabinet of curiosities (museum) References *Clarke, D.L., 1978, Analytical Archaeology (second edition), London: Methuen.

Initially, the mosque was built off Medina in the village of Quba, before Medina expanded to include this village. Depending on whether the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa is older or not, it may be the first mosque in the world that dates to the lifetime of the Islamic Nabi (Prophet) Muhammad in the 7th century CE. According to records, its first stones were positioned by Muhammad as soon as he arrived on his emigration from the city of Mecca to Medina, and the mosque was completed by his companions. Muhammad spent 14 days in this mosque praying qa·π£r (, a short prayer) while waiting for Ali to arrive in Medina, after the latter stayed behind in Mecca to carry out a couple of tasks entrusted to him by the Prophet. Also going along with traditional saying, this mosque is said to be where the first Friday prayer was held, led by the Prophet Muhammad. According to Islamic tradition, performing Wu·∏ç≈´ æ ('Ablution') in one's home then offering two Raka øƒÅt of Nafl (Optional) prayers in the Quba Mosque is equal to performing one  øUmrah. Muhammad used to go there, riding or on foot, every Saturday and offer a two raka øƒÅt-prayer. He advised others to do the same, saying, \\"Whoever makes ablutions at home and then goes and prays in the Mosque of Quba, he will have a reward like that of an 'Umrah.\\" This ·∏•adƒ´th was reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Hakim al-Nishaburi. Also going along with traditional saying, this mosque is said to be where the first Friday prayer was held, led by the Prophet Muhammad. Architecture left When the Driehaus Prize winner and New Classical architect Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil was commissioned, in the 20th century, to conceive a larger mosque, he intended to incorporate the old structure into his design. But the old mosque was torn down and replaced with a new one.Description of the new mosque and architectural documents at archnet.org The new mosque consists of a rectangular prayer hall raised on a second story platform. The prayer hall connects to a cluster containing residential areas, offices, ablution facilities, shops and a library. The recent new construction of the Quba Mosque that happened in 1984 include many new additions, such as 7 main entrances, 4 parallel minarets, and the 56 mini domes that surround the perimeter of the mosque from an overhead point of view. The courtyard of this mosque is composed of black, red, and white marble. And majority of the structure and interior structures such as the minbar and mihrab are all composed of white marble. Originally, there was one minaret, the new renovations included the addition of the other three minarets, they rest on square bases, have octagonal shafts which take on a circular shape as they reach the top. Prayer Hall The prayer hall is arranged around a central courtyard, characterised by six large domes resting on clustered columns. A portico, which is two bays in depth, borders the courtyard on the east and west, while a one-bayed portico borders it on the north, and separates it from the women's prayer area. The women's prayer area, which is surrounded by a screen, is divided into two parts as a passageway connects the northern entrance with the courtyard.

In a series of conflicts, the Ashanti won the initial battles, but were then forced to retreat because Akwapim/Akyem troops had adopted fight-and-run guerilla tactics in the area now called the Akuapim Hills.

It was released in February 1969, through Elektra Records. It was recorded live at Detroit's Grande Ballroom over two nights, Devil's Night and Halloween, 1968. The LP peaked at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 chart, with the title track peaking at No. 82 in the Hot 100. Although the album received an unfavorable review in Rolling Stone magazine upon its release, it has gone on to be considered an important forerunner to punk rock music, and in 2003 was ranked number 294 on Rolling Stone \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list, and 294 in a 2012 revised list. Release The album peaked at number 30 on the Billboard albums chart, \\"in the wake of a publicity blitz\\", wrote Robert Christgau in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). While \\"Ramblin' Rose\\" and \\"Motor City Is Burning\\" open with the band's typical leftist and revolutionary rhetoric, it was the opening line to the title track that stirred up controversy. Vocalist Rob Tyner shouted, \\"And right now... right now... right now it's time to... kick out the jams, motherfuckers!\\" before the opening riffs. Elektra Records executives were offended by the line and had preferred to edit it out of the album (replacing the offending words with \\"brothers and sisters\\"), while the band and manager John Sinclair adamantly opposed this. The original release had \\"kick out the jams, Motherfuckers!\\" printed on the inside album cover, but was soon pulled from stores. Two versions were then released, both with censored album covers, with the uncensored audio version sold behind record counters. Making matters worse, Hudson's department stores refused to carry the album. Tensions between the band and the Hudson's chain escalated to the point that the department stores refused to carry any album from the Elektra label after MC5 took out a full-page ad that, according to Danny Fields, \\"was just a picture of Rob Tyner, and all it said was 'Fuck Hudson's.' And it had the Elektra logo\\". To end the conflict and to avoid further financial loss, Elektra dropped MC5 from their record label. Later the same year, Jefferson Airplane recorded the song \\"We Can Be Together\\" for their Volunteers album, a song containing the word \\"motherfucker\\". Unlike Elektra, RCA Records released the album wholly uncensored. Title meaning \\"Kick out the jams\\" has also been taken to be a slogan of the 1960s ethos of revolution and liberation, an incitement to \\"kick out\\" restrictions in various forms. To quote MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer from his interview with Caroline Boucher in Disc & Music Echo magazine on August 8, 1970: > People said \\"oh wow, 'kick out the jams' means break down restrictions\\" > etc., and it made good copy, but when we wrote it we didn't have that in > mind. We first used the phrase when we were the house band at a ballroom in > Detroit, and we played there every week with another band from the area. > [...] We got in the habit, being the sort of punks we are, of screaming at > them to get off the stage, to kick out the jams, meaning stop jamming. We > were saying it all the time and it became a sort of esoteric phrase. Now, I > think people can get what they like out of it; that's one of the good things > about rock and roll. Kramer also claimed during a 1999 interview that was excerpted for Goldmine magazine that the phrase was specifically aimed toward British 1960s bands playing at the Grande who MC5 felt were not putting enough energy into their performances. The title has also (jokingly) been reinterpreted as an establishment message masquerading as a revolutionary anthem. David Bowie sings in the song \\"Cygnet Committee\\": \\"[We] stoned the poor on slogans such as/Wish You Could Hear/Love Is All We Need/Kick Out the Jams/Kick Out Your Mother\\". Critical reception Upon its release, critic Lester Bangs, writing his inaugural review for Rolling Stone, called Kick Out the Jams a \\"ridiculous, overbearing, pretentious album\\". In contrast to this view, modern opinion of the album generally holds it in very high regard, noting its influence on rock music that has followed. Mark Deming of AllMusic called it \\"one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made\\" in a retrospective review. PopMatters reviewer Adam Williams wrote, \\"For my money, 'Kick Out the Jams' is one of the greatest records ever pressed. It is a magnificent time portal into the past, a fleeting glimpse of a band that actually had the balls to walk it like they talked it\\" and that \\"no live recording has captured the primal elements of rock more than the MC5's inaugural effort.\\" Bangs himself would change his mind about the album, writing in a footnote in his Troggs essay \\"James Taylor Marked for Death\\": Legacy The album cover is briefly visible in the 1986 music video of \\"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\\" by H√ºsker D√º. In March 2005, Q magazine placed the song \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" at number 39 in its \\"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks\\" list. The same track was named the 65th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.

It was cultivated in the 13th century by Spanish learned poets, usually clerics (hence the name 'clerec√≠a'). . Unlike Mester de Juglar√≠a, Mester de Clerec√≠a was written on paper, not anonymous, with regular metre (the cuaderna v√≠a) and done by educated authors. Also the topics are more serious: religious, historical and novelesque. The stanzas in them are composed of 4 alexandrine lines which contain 14 syllables each. The most famous authors of this period are Gonzalo de Berceo and Arcipreste de Hita. The Poema de Fern√°n Gonz√°lez is an example of anonymous mester de clerec√≠a. These poets carefully counted the number of syllables in each line and strived to achieve perfect lines. The line form is the Alexandrine line (14 syllables) with consonantal rhyme in stanzas of four lines each. This form is also known as the cuaderna v√≠a or the fourfold way, and was borrowed from France and was popular until the late fourteenth century. Popular themes of these poets were Christian legends, lives of saints, and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were recited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglar√≠a: didacticism and erudition. Castilian priest and poet Gonzalo de Berceo was one of the greatest followers of the mester de clerec√≠a. All of his works were religious; two of the most well known are Milagros de Nuestra Se√±ora (about the miracles worked by the Virgin Mary) and Vida de Santa Oria. Fourteenth-century poet Juan Ru√≠z, also known as the Arcipreste de Hita, used the cuaderna v√≠a in parts of his famous work Libro de buen amor. He introduced sixteen-syllable lines.

Original building The building lies immediately south of the Hammersmith Flyover. In reference to its hull-like profile, the Ark was designed by architect Ralph Erskine, for Swedish developers Ake Larson and Pronator. Erskine, based in Sweden, worked from a small office in collaboration with other trusted architects in order to retain design freedom. In the case of the Ark, Erskine and Vernon Gracie (who worked with Erskine on Byker Wall in Newcastle) collaborated with London architects Rock Townsend and latterly Lennart Bergstrom in Stockholm. Planning permission for the building was granted on 19 September 1989; building commenced the same day and the complex was completed in 1992. Owing to the difficult economic circumstances at the time, Ake Larson's UK division did not survive to occupy the building. Drinks company Seagram subsequently occupied the Ark from 1996 until it was bought by Vivendi Universal in 2000. Refurbishment The Ark on Talgarth Road In 2006 German property company Deka sold the Ark to Landid backed by GE Real Estate and O&H; Properties, who saw the building required a refit to make the interior better suited for multiple tenants.

The sexual forms or teleomorphs of Cryptococcus species are filamentous fungi in the genus Filobasidiella. The name Cryptococcus is used when referring to the yeast states of the fungi; it comes from the Greek for \\"hidden sphere\\" (literally \\"hidden berry\\"). A few of the species cause a disease called cryptococcosis. General characteristics The cells of these species are covered in a thin layer of glycoprotein capsular material that has a gelatin-like consistency, and that among other functions, serves to help extract nutrients from the soil. The C. neoformans capsule consists of several polysaccharides, of which the major one is the immunomodulatory polysaccharide called glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). GXM is made up of the monosaccharides glucuronic acid, xylose and mannose and can also contain O-acetyl groups. The capsule is functioning as the major virulence factor in cryptococcal infection and disease.Casadevall A and Perfect JR (1998) Cryptococcus neoformans. American Society for Microbiology, ASM Press, Washington DC, 1st edition. Taxonomy of Cryptococcus species Modern molecular technologies increased the validity and readiness in classifying microorganisms in taxonomical level. Cryptococcus spp. has a huge diversity in subspecies level each with different molecular types based on their genetic differences, mainly due to different geographical distributions, molecular characteristics and ecological niches. Serotypes A, D and a hybrid of AD are found among Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii and Cryptococcus neoformans var neoformans. Serotypes B and C are mainly found in Cryptococcus gattii. There are also hybrids between Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. There are 9 major molecular types of pathogenic Cryptococcus spp. - (VNI, VNII, VNB, VNIII, and VNIV) grouped under C. neoformans isolates; (VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV) grouped under C. gattii isolates. Infectious species About 37 species of Cryptococcus are recognized, but the taxonomy of the group is currently being re-evaluated with up-to-date methods. The majority of species live in the soil and are not harmful to humans. Very common species include C. laurentii and C. albidus. Of all species, C. neoformans is the major human and animal pathogen. However, C. laurentii and C. albidus have been known to occasionally cause moderate-to-severe disease, to be specific meningitis, in human patients with compromised immunity (owing to HIV infection, cancer chemotherapy, metabolic immunosuppression, etc.). C. neoformans C. neoformans is the most prominent medically important species. It is best known for causing a severe form of meningitis and meningoencephalitis in people with HIV/AIDS. It may also infect organ- transplant recipients and people receiving certain cancer treatments. C. neoformans is found in the droppings of wild birds, often pigeons; when dust of the droppings is stirred up, it can infect humans or pets that inhale the dust. Infected humans and animals do not transmit their infection to others; they are not infectious. When plated on Niger or birdseed agar, C. neoformans produces melanin, which causes the colonies to have a brown color, and this melanin production is believed to be an important virulence factor.Labrecque O., Sylvestre D. and Messier S. (2005) Systemic Cryptococcus albidus infection in a Doberman Pinscher. J Vet Diagn Invest 17:598-600 C. neoformans produces extracellular vesicles that contain protein components associated with virulence. These vesicles interact with the cell wall and their formation is changed upon mutations in genes responsible for capsule formation. The taxonomy of this species has been reviewed: it has been proposed that it be divided into two species - Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus deneoformans.Sugita T, Cho O, Takashima M (2017) Current status of taxonomy of pathogenic yeasts. Med Mycol J 58(3):J77-J81 Field stain showing Cryptococcus species in lung tissue C. gattii C. gattii (formerly C. neoformans var gattii) is endemic to tropical parts of the continent of Africa and Australia. It is capable of causing disease (cryptococcosis) in nonimmunocompromised people. It has been isolated from eucalyptus trees in Australia. Since 1999, an outbreak of C. gattii infections has occurred in eastern Vancouver Island, an area not generally thought to be endemic for this organism. Cases have since been described in the Pacific Northwest, in both Canada and the United States. The taxonomy of this species has been reviewed; it has been proposed that it be divided into five species - C. gattii, C. bacillisporus, 'C. deuterogattii, C. tetragattii, and C. decagattii. C. albidus C. albidus has been isolated from the air, dry moss in Portugal, grasshoppers in Portugal, and tubercular lungs. The colonies on a macroscopic level are cream- color to pale pink, with the majority of colonies being smooth with a mucoid appearance. Some of the colonies have been found to be rough and wrinkled, but this is a rare occurrence. This species is very similar to C. neoformans, but can be differentiated because it is phenol oxidase-negative, and, when grown on Niger or birdseed agar, C. neoformans produces melanin, causing the cells to take on a brown color, while the C. albidus cells stay cream-colored.(2006) 0609-1 Cryptococcus albidus. Cmpt Mycol Plus On a microscopic level, C. albidus has an ovoid shape, and when viewed with India ink, a capsule is apparent. This species also reproduces through budding. The formation of pseudohyphae has not been seen. C. albidus is able to use glucose, citric acid, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, salicin, cellobiose, and inositol, as well as many other compounds, as sole carbon sources. This species is also able to use potassium nitrate as a nitrogen source. C. albidus produces urease, as is common for Cryptococcus species. C. albidus is very easily mistaken for other Cryptococcus species, as well as species from other genera of yeast, so should be allowed to grow for a minimum of 7 days before attempting to identify this species. While this species is most frequently found in water and plants and is also found on animal and human skin, it is not a frequent human pathogen. Cases of C. albidus infection have increased in humans during the past few years, and it has caused ocular and systemic disease in those with immunoincompetent systems, for example, patients with AIDS, leukemia, or lymphoma. While systemic infections have been found with increasing regularity in humans, it is still relatively rare in animals. The administration of amphotericin B in animals has been successful, but in humans, the treatment usually has poor results. C. albidus var. albidus is a variety of C. albidus that has been considered unique. It differs from C. neoformans because of its ability to assimilate lactose, but not galactose. This species is also considered unique because its strains have a maximum temperature range from between 25 and 37¬∞C. This is important because it violates van Uden‚Äôs rule, which states that the yeast strains of a particular species cannot have their maximum growth temperature vary by more than 5¬∞C. However, some debate exists as to whether or not this maximum temperature range for the strains of C. albidus is accurate, because other research has shown that C. albidus var. albidus strains cannot grow at 37¬∞C. Another variety, 'C. albidus var. diffluens is different from C. neoformans in that it can assimilate melibiose, but not galactose. C. uniguttulatus C. uniguttulatus (Filobasidium uniguttulatus is a teleomorph) was the first non-neoformans Cryptococcus to infect a human. It was isolated from ventricular fluid from a patient having had a neurosurgical procedure. This species was found to be very sensitive to amphotericin B at the minimum inhibitory dose. This species was first isolated from a human nail.

The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints' general manager and another assistant for parts of the 2012 season. Jonathan Vilma, a Saints player who had a major role in the scheme and reportedly offered a $10,000 bounty on Brett Favre, was suspended for the entire season and three other players were suspended for parts of the season.

Dickson. The name Childe Cycle is an allusion to \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\", a poem by Robert Browning, which provided considerable inspiration for elements in Dickson's magnum opus. The series is sometimes referred to as the Dorsai series, as the Dorsai people are central to the series. The related short stories and novellas all center on the Dorsai, primarily members of the Graeme and Morgan families. While, on the face of it, the Childe Cycle is a science fiction series, it is also an allegory. In addition to the six science fiction novels of the Cycle, Dickson had also planned three historical novels and three novels taking place in the present day. In an essay in his book Steel Brother (Tor, 1985), Dickson describes how he conceived the Childe Cycle, the panoramic \\"consciously thematic\\" treatment of the evolution of the human race, and the planned contents of the six never-written novels. Each group of three novels would include one focused on each of three \\"archetypes, the Philosopher, the Warrior, or the Faith-Holder.\\" The first novel's protagonist would be mercenary John Hawkwood, who lived from the 1320s to 1394. Hawkwood \\"has been referred to as the first of the modern generals.\\" He defeated a Milanese ruler who might have stymied the Renaissance. The second historical novel was to deal with the poet John Milton (author of Paradise Lost) in the period he served as a \\"Faith-Holder\\" and \\"Fanatic\\" ... \\"propagandist for the Cromwellian government.\\" The third historical novel's focus would have been on Robert Browning whose \\"poetry is a vehicle for his philosophy.\\" The three twentieth century novels would have focused on: \\"the life and character of George Santayana to showcase a Philosopher,\\" a World War II \\"Warrior,\\" and a female \\"Faith-Holder\\" in the 1980s. The latter novel was expected to deal with issues of space colonization, beginning a thread continuing through Necromancer and concluding with the full formation of the Splinter Cultures. As originally envisioned, the Cycle was to stretch from the 14th century to the 24th century; the completed books begin in the 21st century. The cycle deals with the conflict between progress and conservatism. It also deals with the interaction and conflict among humanity's traits, most importantly Courage, Faith, and Philosophy.  Novels and shorter works  The science fiction novels of the main Childe Cycle include: * Dorsai! (alternate title: The Genetic General) (1959) * Necromancer (1962) (issued under the title No Room for Man between 1963 and 1974) * Soldier, Ask Not (1967) * Tactics of Mistake (1971) * The Final Encyclopedia (1984) * The Chantry Guild (1988) The final book, to have been titled Childe, had not been completed at the time of Dickson's death, and has never been published. Dickson's essay in Steel Brother says it was to chronicle a battle \\"in which the adventurous part of the id family wins its identity over the conservative part, and the human identity is made whole again.\\" In addition, there are four shorter pieces and three novels that take place in the same fictional universe as the Childe Cycle, but are not part of the core cycle. * \\"Lost Dorsai\\" (novella) and \\"Warrior\\" (short story), published together in Lost Dorsai (1980) * \\"Amanda Morgan\\" (novella) and \\"Brothers\\" (short story), published together in The Spirit of Dorsai (1979) In the latter volume, the stories are framed by a conversation between Hal Mayne and the Third Amanda Morgan, during the events of The Final Encyclopedia. \\"Warrior\\" (1965) and \\"Brothers\\" (1973) had previously appeared in other publications. The four works have since been collected in one volume as The Dorsai Companion (1986). The three other novels are: * Young Bleys (1991) * Other (1994) * Antagonist (with David W. Wixon) (2007) These three novels concern the background and development of Bleys Ahrens, the antagonist of The Final Encyclopedia and The Chantry Guild. They take place in the decades leading up to those books, and were apparently added to the original series outline to provide more detail of the ultimate conflict in Childe. 2007 saw the publication of Antagonist, finished by Dickson's long- time assistant David W. Wixon. The first published reference to the Dorsai appeared in \\"Lulungomeena\\", a 1954 short story published in Galaxy Science Fiction and later dramatized on the X Minus One radio program. The narrator is a man from \\"the Dorsai planets,\\" who has been working far from home for a long time. The story portrays the Dorsai people as tough and matter-of-fact, but says little else about them.  Chronology  The main sequence novels basically fall into four periods approximately a century apart. * Necromancer: Late 21st century, shortly before humanity begins star travel * Tactics of Mistake: Late 22nd century, in the early development of the splinter cultures. \\"Amanda Morgan\\" takes place at the same time as the crisis of this book. * Soldier, Ask Not and Dorsai! occur around the same time as each other, and overlap, with some events described in both novels. Late 23rd century, after the splinter cultures have fully developed. * The Final Encyclopedia, followed by The Chantry Guild: Mid-24th century, as the final conflict develops among the cultures. * The final planned volume, Childe, was to resolve the conflict which had been set up in the last two books. Its events would immediately follow the events of The Chantry Guild.  Splinter cultures  By the late 21st century, human culture begins to fragment into different aspects. Following the events of Necromancer, humanity has colonized some 14 Younger Worlds. The inhabitants of these worlds have evolved culturally, and to some extent, genetically, into several specialized Splinter Cultures. This was done by the racial collective unconscious itself as an experiment to see what aspects of humanity are the most important. The inhabitants of Earth (now called Old Earth, since New Earth is one of the Younger Worlds) remain \\"full spectrum humans\\" as a control. The interstellar economy is based on the exchange of specialists, which puts Old Earth, the jack of all trades, at something of a disadvantage. Of all the Splinter Cultures, three are the most successful: * The Dorsai (Courage): The Dorsai, inhabitants of a Younger World also called Dorsai, are honorable, elite mercenaries. Given the book-selling nature of their occupation, the Childe Cycle focuses mainly on their exploits, to the extent that the Cycle is sometimes called the \\"Dorsai series\\". The culture tends to have a number of Gaelic influences, including a love for the bagpipes, although their ancestry is drawn from all races and cultures. Dickson also mentioned in lectures that the \\"ethnic food\\" of the Dorsai is fish and chips, due to the great amount of surface water and oceans on their homeworld, with mutton being the most common red meat in the Dorsai diet. * The Exotics (Philosophy): The Exotics are the inhabitants of Mara and Kultis. They are peaceful philosophers, the descendants of the 21st century Chantry Guild. The traits which Dickson assigns to the Exotics in many ways mirror the Human Potential Movement of the 1960s, in combining elements of Eastern philosophy and religion with psychology. The Exotics clearly have some vaguely described level of paranormal powers. They can, among other things, communicate between star systems far more quickly than a ship can travel, an ability no other culture has. The Exotics hire themselves out as psychiatrists and mediators, among other things. The paranormal ability of the Exotics is never shown definitively (save for Donal levitating with Exotic encouragement in Dorsai!), and The Final Encyclopedia reveals that their rapid communications ability is based on the use of a carefully hidden network of spaceships used innovatively, rather than on paranormal abilities. * The Friendlies (Faith/Fanaticism): The somewhat ironically named Friendlies inhabit the worlds of Harmony and Association. Friendlies can be true faith- holders, or they can be fanatics. The difference, according to the Cycle, is that true faith-holders are guided by their faith, while fanatics use their faith to justify their actions. The Friendly homeworlds experience continual sectarian civil war. On their home planets, they are primarily agrarian, but, like the Dorsai, they earn interstellar credit as mercenaries, fighting in other people's wars. Unlike the Dorsai, Friendly mercenaries are drafted as cannon-fodder, with largely green troops and high casualty rates. However, they are tenacious defenders. While the Friendlies are sometimes presented as villains, their faith is co-equal in importance to humanity with the Courage of the Dorsai and the Philosophy of the Exotics. A recurring theme in the series is the experience of a young man placed among Friendlies, forced to gain respect for them. Dickson based the Friendlies on Oliver Cromwell's \\"Roundheads\\" of the English Civil War. Other Splinter Cultures include the hard scientists of Newton and Venus, the miners of Coby, the fishermen of Dunnin's World, the engineers of Cassida, the Catholic farmers of St. Marie, and the merchants of Ceta. The internal consistency of the series suggests that the resolution to be sought in Childe is the evolution of Responsible Man, individuals who integrate the three disciplines of the Dorsai, the Exotics, and the Friendlies to the overall advancement of humanity, and who do possess explicit if not yet well-defined paranormal abilities. As of The Chantry Guild, only Donal Graeme/Hal Mayne has achieved the full status of Responsible Man. The conflict which drives this evolution is the developing war between Old Earth, supplemented by the Dorsai and the Exotics, and the organization of Others led by Bleys Ahrens, with the aid of the Friendlies and a powerful (but largely irrelevant to the psychological conflict) coalition of the technically inclined younger worlds. The strength of the Others is that they are hybrids of two of the Splinter Cultures (Ahrens is of Friendly and Exotic extraction), and while less capable than the emerging Responsible Men they are significantly more numerous, and more interested in gaining power for themselves (as by Ahrens using his combined background to manipulate the entire Friendly culture to support his war against the Dorsai, Exotics, and Old Earth).  Planets of the Childe Cycle  Dickson has admitted that he was frequently inconsistent on the total number of inhabited worlds. The correct total is sixteen, under nine stars (counting Alpha Centauri A and B separately). Some uninhabited planets also play a role in the series. * Sol  Mercury: Site of Project: Springboard during the 21st century. Not a major inhabited world.  Venus: Hard Science culture. Research stations were set up early, expanded, and eventually became connected together.  Old Earth: Homeworld of Humanity, and most populated and richest of the worlds. Politically not very united.  Mars: First human colony to be terraformed. Cold, and is not a major power. * Alpha Centauri: Has 12 planetary bodies.  Newton: Hard Science culture, the leading world in science. It is also known to have the best physicists.  Cassida: Hard Science culture, known for its technicians and engineers. A poor world, it also provided mercenaries. * Altair  Dunnin's World: A harsh, dry world, with low population and resources. * Epsilon Eridani: Both Harmony and Association are ruled by the Joint Church Council (United Council of Churches). Both worlds are known for their cheap but poor mercenaries.  Association: Poor world, lacking in many resources and has poor soil for growing crops.  Harmony: Similar to Association. * Fomalhaut  Dorsai: A watery world of primarily island settlements. Known for having the highest quality professional mercenaries, and for producing soldiers unlike any other. * Procyon: Mara and Kultis are ruled by the Exotics, and are known for producing the best psychologists.  Mara  Kultis  Ste. Marie: A small Roman Catholic farming world.  Zombri: An uninhabitable small world. Despite this, it is a strategic location.  Coby: Mining planet. A world of tunnels and mines, where the surface is uninhabitable. Since all the other settled worlds, unlike Earth, are metal- poor, Coby is the primary source of metals for the other planets. * Sirius  New Earth: Once had an atmosphere of hydrogen sulphide. By the late 23rd Century, it had long been terraformed with a more breathable atmosphere. Has a large variety of cultures. Atland, a territory of New Earth, had a civil war fought between the North and South Partitions.  Freiland  Oriente: an uninhabited planet, airless with a highly eccentric orbit. It is important only as a strategic military base in Dorsai! * Tau Ceti  Ceta: Commercial low-gravity planet.  Primary characters  * Necromancer :Paul Formain :Walter Blunt :Kantele Maki * Tactics of Mistake :Cletus Grahame :Eachan Khan :Melissa Khan Grahame :Dow deCastries * Soldier, Ask Not :Tam Olyn (as a young man) :Jamethon Black :Kensie and Ian Graeme (Great-grandsons of Cletus and Melissa) * Dorsai! :Donal Graeme (Great-great-grandson of Cletus and Melissa) :Anea Marlivana :William of Ceta :Ian Graeme * The Final Encyclopedia and Chantry Guild :Hal Mayne :Tam Olyn (as a very old man) :Bleys Ahrens :Amanda Morgan (the third of that name)  Technology  Throughout the series, Dickson's primary interest is the characters, not the hardware, much of which is explained only to the point where the reader will understand how it relates to the people around it and thus share the author's imagery. Hyperdrive The invention of the phase-shift drive allowed the colonization of the Younger Worlds. (The drive used in the Childe Cycle appears in many of Gordon R. Dickson's works.) It uses an application of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. During a jump, a spaceship's position becomes infinitely uncertain, and occupies every position in the universe, before resolving again at a specific point. The jump itself is instantaneous, but each jump requires a lengthy calculation. A jump is never exact, and long journeys require several jumps, each getting closer to the final destination. A certain percentage of jumps never resolve, and the ships are never seen again. Because of this, the higher the number of jumps, the greater the risk. By the 24th century, a ship could jump directly off a planet's surface, but only the Dorsai are brave/foolhardy enough to do this on a routine basis. When the phase-shift drive was first invented, a jump would cause passengers severe disorientation. During the Necromancer period (21st century), the disorientation was so bad that the technology was limited to inanimate cargo. The invention of certain drugs enabled human passengers to use the drive. By the 23rd century, these drugs were only necessary in the case of repeated jumps. By the 24th century, the jumps were hardly noticeable. Weapons A large part of the series focuses on the exploits of the Dorsai. In the face of escalating countermeasures, the Dorsai choose to use relatively simple weapons, which are both reliable and effective. The other militaries follow suit. By the 23rd century, the average civilian sports hunter has a more technologically advanced weapon than the average soldier. In fact, \\"advanced\\" small arms are treated with derision, such as the \\"Dally Gun\\" which Cletus uses to break up an ambush in Tactics of Mistake. The Dally Gun is possibly derived from a Cadillac Gage weapons system of the 1960s, the Stoner 63, which (like the \\"Dial-A-Gun\\" from the story) was designed with interchangeable components for reconfiguration as needed for a particular mission. While the Stoner 63 received significant use with the SEALs of the U.S. NAVY up until 1980 (with high praise regarding both durability and reliability, although it was a bit heavier than other comparable systems), the Dally Gun was considered a failure. The main infantry weapon throughout the Cycle is the cone rifle. This simple weapon, patterned after the Gyrojet series of small arms, uses chemical-rocket-propelled flechettes. These flechettes are cone shaped, allowing them to be stacked into tubes. The rifles are little more than launching platforms with triggering mechanisms. Because the cones (which explode on impact) accelerate after being fired from the rifle, they are more deadly at long ranges than short. Also used are spring rifles, utilizing a 5,000 sliver magazine in a non-metallic mechanism to fire a sliver up to one thousand meters. Power guns (energy weapons) were available as early as Cletus' period, where his aide is nearly killed with one. Sonic cannons are also used as weapons.

Its teleomorph is Filobasidiella neoformans, a filamentous fungus belonging to the class Tremellomycetes. It is often found in bird excrement. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal organism and it can cause disease in apparently immunocompetent, as well as immunocompromised, hosts.\\"What Makes Cryptococcus neoformans a Pathogen? - Volume 4, Number 1‚ÄîMarch 1998 - Emerging Infectious Diseases - CDC\\". wwwnc.cdc.gov. Retrieved 2017-04-18  Classification  Cryptococcus neoformans has undergone numerous nomenclature revisions since its first description in 1894. For instance, it once contained two varieties (var.): C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. neoformans var. grubii. A third variety, C. neoformans var. gattii, was defined as a distinct species, Cryptococcus gattii. The most recent classification system divides organisms into seven species. C. neoformans refers to C. neoformans var. grubii. A new species name, Cryptococcus deneoformans, is used for the former C. neoformans var. neoformans. C. gattii is divided into five species. Characteristics C. neoformans stained by Gram stain C. neoformans grows as a yeast (unicellular) and replicates by budding. It makes hyphae during mating, and eventually creates basidiospores at the end of the hyphae before producing spores. Under host-relevant conditions, including low glucose, serum, 5% carbon dioxide, and low iron, among others, the cells produce a characteristic polysaccharide capsule. The recognition of C. neoformans in Gram-stained smears of purulent exudates may be hampered by the presence of the large gelatinous capsule which apparently prevents definitive staining of the yeast-like cells. In such stained preparations, it may appear either as round cells with Gram-positive granular inclusions impressed upon a pale lavender cytoplasmic background or as Gram-negative lipoid bodies. When grown as a yeast, C. neoformans has a prominent capsule composed mostly of polysaccharides. Under the microscope, the India ink stain is used for easy visualization of the capsule in cerebral spinal fluid. The particles of ink pigment do not enter the capsule that surrounds the spherical yeast cell, resulting in a zone of clearance or \\"halo\\" around the cells. This allows for quick and easy identification of C. neoformans. Unusual morphological forms are rarely seen. For identification in tissue, mucicarmine stain provides specific staining of polysaccharide cell wall in C. neoformans. Cryptococcal antigen from cerebrospinal fluid is thought to be the best test for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in terms of sensitivity, though it might be unreliable in HIV-positive patients. The first genome sequence for a strain of C. neoformans (var. neoformans; now C. deneoformans) was published in 2005. Studies suggest that colonies of C. neoformans and related fungi growing on the ruins of the melted down reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant may be able to use the energy of radiation for \\"radiotrophic\\" growth.  Pathology  Infection with C. neoformans is termed cryptococcosis. Most infections with C. neoformans occur in the lungs. However, fungal meningitis and encephalitis, especially as a secondary infection for AIDS patients, are often caused by C. neoformans, making it a particularly dangerous fungus. Infections with this fungus are rare in those with fully functioning immune systems.What Makes Cryptococcus neoformans a Pathogen?, Kent L. Buchanan and Juneann W. Murphy University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA So, C. neoformans is sometimes referred to as an opportunistic fungus. It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can utilize host phagocytes to spread within the body. Cryptococcus neoformans was the first intracellular pathogen for which the non-lytic escape process termed vomocytosis was observed. It has been speculated that this ability to manipulate host cells results from environmental selective pressure by amoebae, a hypothesis first proposed by Arturo Casadevall under the term \\"accidental virulence\\". In human infection, C. neoformans is spread by inhalation of aerosolized basidiospores, and can disseminate to the central nervous system, where it can cause meningoencephalitis. In the lungs, C. neoformans cells are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Macrophages produce oxidative and nitrosative agents, creating a hostile environment, to kill invading pathogens. However, some C. neoformans cells can survive intracellularly in macrophages. Intracellular survival appears to be the basis for latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to eradication by antifungal agents. One mechanism by which C. neoformans survives the hostile intracellular environment of the macrophage involves upregulation of expression of genes involved in responses to oxidative stress. Traversal of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier by C. neoformans plays a key role in meningitis pathogenesis. However, precise mechanisms by which it passes the blood-brain barrier are still unknown; one recent study in rats suggested an important role of secreted serine proteases. The metalloprotease Mpr1 has been demonstrated to be critical in blood-brain barrier penetration. Meiosis (sexual reproduction), another possible survival factor for intracellular C. neoformans The vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates of C. neoformans are mating type alpha. Filaments of mating type alpha have haploid nuclei ordinarily, but these can undergo a process of diploidization (perhaps by endoduplication or stimulated nuclear fusion) to form diploid cells termed blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores are able to undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can then be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. Required for this process is a gene designated dmc1, a conserved homologue of genes recA in bacteria, and rad51 in eukaryotes (see articles recA and rad51). Dmc1 mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. One benefit of meiosis in C. neoformans could be to promote DNA repair in the DNA-damaging environment caused by the oxidative and nitrosative agents produced in macrophages. Thus, C. neoformans can undergo a meiotic process, monokaryotic fruiting, that may promote recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA-damaging environment of the host macrophage, and this may contribute to its virulence.  Serious complications  Infection starts in lungs, disseminates via blood to meninges and then to other parts of the body. Capsule inhibits phagocytosis. Can cause a systemic infection, including fatal meningitis known as meningoencephalitis in normal, diabetic and immunocompromised hosts. The infection from C. neoformans in the brain can be fatal if untreated. CNS (central nervous system) infection may also be present as a brain abscess known as cryptococcomas, subdural effusion, dementia, isolated cranial nerve lesion, spinal cord lesion, and ischemic stroke. If cryptococcal meningitis occurs, mortality rate is between 10‚Äì30%. Public Health Agency of Canada  Treatment  C. neoformans seen in the lung of a patient with AIDS: The inner capsule of the organism stains red in this photomicrograph. Cryptococcosis that does not affect the central nervous system can be treated with fluconazole alone. Cryptococcal meningitis should be treated for two weeks with intravenous amphotericin B 0.7-1.0 mg/kg/day and oral flucytosine 100 mg/kg/day (or intravenous flucytosine 75 mg/kg/day if the patient is unable to swallow). This should then be followed by oral fluconazole 400‚Äì800 mg daily for ten weeks and then 200 mg daily for at least one year and until the patient's CD4 count is above 200 cells/mcl. Flucytosine is a generic, off-patent medicine. However, a market failure exists, with a two-week cost of flucytosine therapy being about $10,000. As a result, flucytosine is currently universally unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. In 1970, flucytosine was available in Africa. Intravenous ambisome 4 (mg/kg)/day may be used but is not superior; its main use is in patients who do not tolerate amphotericin B. The dose of 200 mg/kg/day for flucytosine is not more effective, is associated with more side effects and should not be used. In Africa, oral fluconazole at a rate of 200 mg daily is often used. However, this does not result in cure, because it merely suppresses the fungus and does not kill it; viable fungus can continue to be grown from cerebrospinal fluid of patients not having taken fluconazole for many months. An increased dose of 400 mg daily does not improve outcomes, but prospective studies from Uganda and Malawi reported that higher doses of 1200 mg per day have more fungicidal activity. The outcomes with fluconazole monotherapy have 30% worse survival than amphotericin-based therapies, in a recent systematic review.

He participated in the First Russian circumnavigation of the globe and subsequently became a leader of another circumnavigation expedition that discovered the continent of Antarctica. Bellingshausen was born on Osel Island. He started his service in the Russian Baltic Fleet, and after distinguishing himself joined the First Russian circumnavigation of the Earth in 1803‚Äì1806, serving on the merchant ship Nadezhda under the captaincy of Adam Johann von Krusenstern. After the journey he published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas and islands of the Pacific Ocean. Subsequently, he commanded several ships of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. As a prominent cartographer, Bellingshausen was appointed to command the Russian circumnavigation of the globe in 1819‚Äì1821, intended to explore the Southern Ocean and to find land in the proximity of the South Pole. Mikhail Lazarev prepared the expedition and was made Bellingshausen's second-in-command and the captain of the sloop Mirny, while Bellingshausen himself commanded the sloop Vostok. During this expedition Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see the land of Antarctica on 27 January 1820 (New Style). They circumnavigated the continent twice and never lost each other from view. Thus they disproved Captain Cook's assertion that it was impossible to find land in the southern ice-fields. The expedition discovered and named Peter I Island, Zavodovski, Leskov and Visokoi Islands, the Antarctic Peninsula and Alexander Island (Alexander Coast), and made other discoveries in the tropical waters of the Pacific. Made counter admiral on his return, Bellingshausen participated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829. Promoted to vice-admiral, he again served in the Baltic Fleet in 1830s, and from 1839 he was the military governor of Kronstadt, where he died. In 1831 he published the book on his Antarctic travels, called Double Investigation of the Southern Polar Ocean and the Voyage Around the World (–î–≤—É–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑—ã—Å–∫–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤ —é–∂–Ω–æ–ø–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ–º –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω–µ –∏ –ø–ª–∞–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞).

Early life and career Coat of arms of Bellingshausen family Bellingshausen was born to a Baltic German noble Bellingshausen family in the , √ñsel County in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire; now Saare County, Estonia. His paternal family had Holsteinish origins, the surname Bellingshausen was first recorded in L√ºbeck. He enlisted as a cadet in the Imperial Russian Navy at the age of ten. After graduating from the Kronstadt naval academy at age eighteen, Bellingshausen rapidly rose to the rank of captain. First Russian circumnavigation Nadezdha, on which Bellingshausen served under captain Krusenstern during the first Russian circumnavigation. A great admirer of Cook's voyages, Bellingshausen served from 1803 in the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. He was one of the officers of the vessel Nadezhda (\\"Hope\\"), commanded by Adam Johann von Krusenstern. The mission was completed in 1806. After the journey Bellingshausen published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas and islands of the Pacific Ocean. Service as captain Bellingshausen's career continued with the command of various ships in the Baltic and Black Seas. From 1812 to 1816 he commanded the frigate Minerva and from 1817 to 1819 the frigate Flora, both in the Black Sea Fleet. During 1812 he met on Macquarie island Richard Siddins, the Australian captain of the ship Campbell Macquarie. First Russian Antarctic expedition The First Russian Antarctic expedition 1819‚Äì1821. Captain Faddey Bellingshausen with the Cross of the Order of St. Vladimir When Emperor Alexander I authorized an expedition to the south polar region in 1819, the authorities selected Bellingshausen to lead it as an experienced captain and explorer, and a prominent cartographer. The expedition was intended to explore the Southern Ocean and to find land in the proximity of the South Pole. The preparation work on the two ships, the 985-ton sloop-of-war Vostok (\\"East\\") and the 530-ton support vessel Mirny (\\"Peaceful\\") was carried out by Mikhail Lazarev, who had captained his own circumnavigation of the globe before. Bellingshausen became the captain of Vostok, and Lazarev captained Mirny. The journey started from Kronstadt on 4 June 1819. They stopped briefly in England, where Bellingshausen met with Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. Banks had sailed with Captain James Cook fifty years earlier and supplied the Russians with books and charts for their expedition.https://antarctic- logistics.com/2010/08/28/fabian-gottlieb-von-bellingshausen/ Leaving Portsmouth on 5 September 1819 the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle (the first to do so since Cook) on 26 January 1820 (New Style). On 27 January the expedition discovered the Antarctic mainland approaching the Antarctic coast at a point with coordinates 69¬∫21'28\\"S 2¬∫14'50\\"W and seeing ice-fields there. The point in question lies within twenty miles of the Antarctic mainland. Bellingshausen's diary, his report to the Russian Naval Minister on 21 July 1821 and other documents, available in the Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic in Saint Petersburg, Russia, were carefully compared with the log-books of other claimants by the British polar historian A. G. E. Jones in his 1982 study Antarctica Observed. Jones concluded that Bellingshausen, rather than the Royal Navy's Edward Bransfield on 30 January 1820 or the American Nathaniel Palmer on 17 November 1820, was indeed the discoverer of the sought-after Terra Australis. During the voyage Bellingshausen also visited Ship Cove in New Zealand, the South Shetland Islands,L. Ivanov. General Geography and History of Livingston Island.

He is celebrated for his poems on religious subjects, written in a style of verse which has been called Mester de Clerec√≠a, shared with more secular productions such as the Libro de Alexandre, the Libro de Apolonio. He is considered the first Castilian poet known by name. Gonzalo is recorded as being a deacon in his home parish in the early 1220s, and as a priest from 1237 on. It has been surmised that he may have studied in the nascent university of Palencia, and may have served in the curia of the bishop of Calahorra. He wrote devotional and theological works. The devotional may be divided into two sub-sections: the Marian (the long Milagros de Nuestra Se√±ora (Miracles of Our Lady - perhaps influenced by Gautier de Coincy), the Duelo de la Virgen (the Mourning of the Virgin, a dialogue between the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux) and Loores de la Virgen (the Praises of the Virgin, which is a type of salvation history); and the hagiographical (the Vida de San Mill√°n de la Cogolla, Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos and the Vida de Santa Oria: the lives of Aemilian of la Cogolla, Dominic of Silos, and Aurea (Oria)). These three saints have a strong regional attachment: Aemilian, a Visigothic saint, was patron of the nearby monastery; Dominic, 11th century abbot of Silos and one of the most important saints in thirteenth-century Iberia, was born in the town of Ca√±as, near to Berceo; and Aurea was an anchoress who lived in the monastery of San Mill√°n during the late eleventh century. He also wrote the fragmentary Martirio de San Lorenzo (the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, a Roman martyr of the third century), which may be connected to a shrine of Saint Lawrence supposedly built by Aemilian himself, at the top of the mountain below which the monastery of San Mill√°n is situated. The theological works are the Del sacrificio de la misa (On the Sacrifice of the Mass), a verse-compendium of the significance of the priest's actions during the eucharist; and Los signos del juicio final (the Signs of the Last Judgement), a description of the prodigies that will be witnessed before the return of Christ to judge the living and the dead. His proximity to San Mill√°n and his composition of hagiographies which seem to support the monastery's interests, have led him to be considered a propagandist for the narrow interests of the monastery of San Mill√°n. This view has been propounded above all by Professor Brian Dutton, editor of Gonzalo de Berceo's collected works, although some critics (notably Fernando Ba√±os and Isabel Ur√≠a Maqua) have taken a view which presents the poet as less motivated by his concerns for the monastery; others (particularly Gregory Andrachuk) have linked him to the Lateran reforms.

He was a silicon transistor pioneer, and a member of the \\"traitorous eight\\". He developed the planar process, an important technology for reliably fabricating and manufacturing semiconductor devices, such as transistors and integrated circuits. Biography Hoerni was born on September 26, 1924 in Geneva, Switzerland. He received his B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Geneva and two Ph.D.s in Physics; one from the University of Geneva and the other from the University of Cambridge. In 1952, he moved to the United States to work at the California Institute of Technology, where he became acquainted with William Shockley, a physicist at Bell Labs who was intimately involved with the creation of the transistor. A few years later, Shockley recruited Hoerni to work with him at the newly founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments in Mountain View, California. But Shockley's strange behavior compelled the so- called \\"traitorous eight\\": Hoerni, Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts, to leave his laboratory and create the Fairchild Semiconductor corporation. In 1958, Hoerni attended an Electrochemical Society meeting, where Bell Labs engineer Mohamed Atalla presented a paper about the passivation of p-n junctions by oxide, and demonstrated silicon dioxide's passivating effect on a silicon surface. Hoerni was intrigued, and came up with the concept of planar technology one morning while thinking about Atalla's device. Taking advantage of silicon dioxide's passivating effect on the silicon surface, Hoerni proposed to make transistors that were protected by a layer of silicon dioxide. The planar process was invented by Jean Hoerni, with his first patent filed in May 1959. The planar process was critical in the invention of Silicon Integrated circuit by Robert Noyce.caltech.edu/570/2/Moore.pdf \\"The Accidental Entrepreneur\\", Gordon E. Moore, Engineering & Science, Summer 1994 Noyce built on Hoerni's work with his conception of an integrated circuit, which added a layer of metal to the top of Hoerni's basic structure to connect different components, such as transistors, capacitors, or resistors, located on the same piece of silicon. The planar process provided a powerful way of implementing an integrated circuit that was superior to earlier conceptions of the device. With Noyce, Jack Kilby from Texas Instruments is usually credited with the invention of the integrated circuit, but Kilby's IC was based on Germanium. As it turns out, Silicon ICs have numerous advantages over germanium. The name \\"Silicon Valley\\" refers to this silicon.\\"Jean Hoerni (American engineer)\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannicaonline Along with the \\"traitorous eight\\" alumni Jay Last and Sheldon Roberts, Hoerni founded Amelco (known now as Teledyne) in 1961. In 1964, he founded Union Carbide Electronics, and in 1967, he founded Intersil, where he became a pioneer of low-voltage CMOS-Integrated Circuits. He was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1969 and the McDowell Award in 1972. Hoerni died of myelofibrosis on January 12, 1997 in Seattle, Washington. He was 72. Personal life He was married to Anne Marie Hoerni and had three children: Annie Blackwell, Susan Killham, and Michael Hoerni. He had one brother, Marc Hoerni. His second marriage to Ruth Carmona also ended in divorce.  Philanthropy  An avid mountain climber, Hoerni often visited the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan and was moved by the poverty of the Balti mountain people who lived there. He contributed the lion's share, $30,000, to Greg Mortenson's project to build a school in the remote village of Korphe, and later founded the Central Asia Institute with an endowment of $1 million to continue providing services for them after his death.Three Cups of Tea, chapter 5. (disk 2, tracks 16-18 of the audiobook version)\\"A gift for an entire village A failed mountaineer becomes a philanthropist after a village without a school saves his life\\" , Marilyn Gardner, Christian Science Monitor, September 12, 2006 Hoerni named Greg Mortenson as the first Executive Director of the organization, which continues to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\"Central Asia Institute History\\" , Central Asia Institute In December 2007, an article was published by Michael Riordan on Hoerni and his planar process in IEEE Spectrum. The author claimed that Jay Last pointed out that Hoerni had incredible stamina and could hike for hours on little food or water.

She took her stage name, Barbara, from her grandmother, Varvara Brodsky, a native of Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Her song \\"L'Aigle noir\\" sold 1 million copies in twelve hours. Childhood Born in Paris to a Jewish family, Barbara was ten years old when she had to go into hiding during the German occupation of France in World War II. After the war ended, a neighborhood professor of music heard her sing and took an interest in helping her develop her talents. She was given vocal lessons and taught to play the piano, and eventually she enrolled at the Ecole Sup√©rieure de Musique. Money was a problem and she gave up her musical studies to sing at \\"La Fontaine des Quatre Saisons,\\" a popular cabaret in Paris. She was deeply scarred by the war and her family's plight. The feelings of emptiness experienced during childhood showed in her songs, particularly \\"Mon Enfance\\". She said in her uncompleted autobiography, Il √©tait un piano noir (assembled from notes found after her death), that her father sexually abused her when she was ten and she hated him for that. He later abandoned the family. Musical development The New York Times portrait of Barbara by Reginald Gray A tall person, Barbara dressed in black as she sang melancholy songs of lost love. From 1950 to 1952, after her father's desertion of her family, she lived in Brussels, where she became part of an active artistic community. Her painter and writer friends took over an old house, converting it into workshops and a concert hall with a piano where she performed the songs of √âdith Piaf, Juliette Gr√©co and Germaine Montero. However, her career evolved slowly and she struggled constantly to eke out a living. Returning to Paris, she met Jacques Brel and became a lifelong friend, singing many of his songs. Later she met Georges Brassens, whose songs she began to use in her act and to record on her first album. In the 1950s, she sang at some of the smaller clubs and began building a fan base, particularly with the young students from the Latin Quarter. In 1957, she went back to Brussels to record her first single, but it was not until 1961 that she got a real break when she sang at the Bobino Music-Hall in Montparnasse. Dressed in a long black robe, she gave a haunting performance, but the Parisian critics said she lacked naturalness and was stiff and formal in her presentation. She continued to perform at small clubs, and two years later at the Th√©√¢tre des Capucines she succeeded with the audience and critics alike, singing new material she had written herself. From that point on, her career blossomed and she signed a major recording contract in 1964 with Philips Records. Musical influences Influenced originally by songwriters Mireille and Pierre MacOrlan, she developed her own style and the writing of her own songs transformed her image into that of a unique singer-songwriter. In the 1960s, she wrote her landmark song, \\"Ma plus belle histoire d'amour c'est vous\\" (\\"My Most Beautiful Love Story Is You\\"), and others for which she remains famous such as \\"L'aigle noir\\", \\"Nantes\\", \\"La solitude\\", \\"G√∂ttingen\\" and \\"Une petite cantate.\\" These five songs plus \\"Dis, quand reviendras-tu?\\" were translated into German by Belgian-German singer-songwriter Didier Caesar. The song \\"G√∂ttingen\\" (named after the German city of G√∂ttingen) is said to have contributed more to post-war German‚ÄìFrench reconciliation than any speech by a politician. On the 40th anniversary of the Elys√©e agreement, ex- chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der quoted from the song in his official speech in the Ch√¢teau de Versailles.The Inner Voice of France, BBC Radio 3, December 2011, presented by Norman Lebrecht Middle years She returned to Bobino in 1964 for several sold-out performances. She performed at the Paris Olympia and other important venues in France, becoming one of her country's most beloved stars. In 1965, she released the album Barbara chante Barbara, which became a critical and financial success, winning the Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy. At the award ceremony, Barbara tore her award into several pieces, giving a piece to each of her technicians as a sign of her gratitude. Acting career In 1969, she wrote the theme song \\"Moi, je me balance\\" for the film La fianc√©e du pirate. She announced that she would limit her concert singing, and in 1970 she made her acting d√©but in the stage play Madame that proved to be a commercial flop. In 1971 she co-starred with Jacques Brel in a film he directed titled Franz. Two years later she starred in L'Oiseau rare directed by Jean-Claude Brialy. Her final film role came in 1975 in Je suis n√© √† Venise by choreographer Maurice B√©jart. All√©e Barbara in Paris Later years and death Barbara's career remained active in the 1970s, with appearances on television variety shows with stars such as Johnny Hallyday and a tour of Japan, Canada, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Through the 1980s, she continued to tour and to write songs; her album Seule was one of France's top grossing releases of 1981. The next year she was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque in recognition of her contribution to French culture. She developed a close working relationship with rising film star G√©rard Depardieu and his wife √âlisabeth, collaborating on songs for film and records. In 1986 she went to New York City to perform on piano at the Metropolitan Opera with Mikhail Baryshnikov in a song and dance ballet presentation. She co-wrote the music for the stage play Lily Passion with Luc Plamondon, in which she co-starred with Depardieu. It told the story of a killer who murders someone each time he hears her sing. In the latter part of the 1980s she became active in the fight against AIDS. She recorded SID'Amour √† mort and gave out condoms at performances. In 1988 the government of France awarded her the Legion of Honour. Health problems impeded her performing and she began to devote time to the writing of her memoirs. However, she recorded another successful album in 1996‚Äîwhich sold over a million copies in twelve hours‚Äîbefore she died of respiratory problems in Neuilly-sur-Seine (a suburb of Paris), on 24 November 1997. She was interred in the family grave at the Cimeti√®re de Bagneux in southwest Paris. Personal life In October 1953 she married Claude John Luc Sluys, a Belgian law student, but they separated in 1956. She wrote many very personal songs, including \\"Nantes\\" about her father and \\"Une petite cantate\\", which was dedicated to her friend Liliane B√©nelli, born Gnansia, who died in a car accident in 1965. Later in life, she wrote a song to her public \\"Ma plus belle histoire d'amour\\" and another about her musicians \\"Mes hommes\\". Musical legacy Barbara's musical legacy is revealed in the writing of a number of singers, French-speaking and otherwise. A style referred to as \\"Nouvelle Chanson\\",() or \\"New Chanson\\", artists such as Keren Ann, Benjamin Biolay, Coralie Clement, Emilie Simon, Daphn√©, Vincent Delerm and Tancr√®de are often cited as exponents of the updated style. One of the few English-speaking artists to cover her work is Marc Almond, whose version of \\"Amours Incestueuses\\" (\\"Incestuous Loves\\") was released on his 1996 album \\"Absinthe\\". The Anglo-French biographer David Bret, a close friend of Barbara, wrote at her behest \\"Les Hommes Bafou√©s\\", a song about AIDS prejudice. Bret also adapted three of her songs, \\"Ma Plus Belle Histoire D'Amour\\", \\"La Solitude\\", and \\"Pr√©cy Jardin\\" into English for Barbara. These were taped in 1992, but so far have never been released. Maria del Mar Bonet, a Catalan singer made, in 1971, a cover of L'Aigle Noir in Catalan and made a success of it in Spanish-language countries. L'Aigle Noir has also been adapted and sung in Spanish, and Swedish (Rikard Wolff), and many times in Japanese, also with great success. Well-known contemporary artists such as New York based Martha Wainwright, Spanish singer-songwriter Conchita Mendivil (who both recently reprised \\"Dis, Quand Reviendras-tu?\\", and Regina Spektor (with \\"Apr√®s Moi\\"), and London-based singer-songwriter Ana Silvera have reprised songs sung by Barbara.

He was a member of the Nehru‚ÄìGandhi family. During his lifetime he was widely expected to succeed his mother as head of the Indian National Congress, but following his early death in a plane crash his elder brother Rajiv became their mother's political heir, and succeeded her as Prime Minister of India after her assassination. His wife Maneka Gandhi and son Varun Gandhi are leading politicians in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Early life and education Rajiv, Indira and Sanjay Gandhi Sanjay was born in New Delhi, on 14 December 1946, as the younger son of Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi. Like his elder brother Rajiv Gandhi, Sanjay was educated at St. Columba's School, Delhi, Welham Boys' School, Dehra Dun and then at the Doon School, Dehra Dun. Sanjay was also educated at the Ecole D'Humanit√©, an international boarding school in Switzerland. Sanjay did not attend university, but took up automotive engineering as a career and underwent an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce in Crewe, England for three years.First Woman of India St. Petersburg Times, 10 January 1966. He was very interested in sports cars, and also obtained a pilot's licence in 1976. He was interested in aircraft acrobatics and won several prizes in that sport. His elder brother Rajiv Gandhi was however a Captain in Indian Airlines flying the Boeing 737-200ADV aircraft. Sanjay was also close to his mother. Maruti Limited controversy In 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Cabinet proposed the production of a \\"People's car\\": an efficient indigenous car that middle-class Indians could afford. In June 1971, a company known as Maruti Motors Limited (now Maruti Suzuki) was incorporated under the Companies Act and Sanjay Gandhi became its Managing Director. While Sanjay had no previous experience, design proposals or links with any corporation, he was awarded the contract to build the car and the exclusive production licence. The criticism that followed this decision was mostly directed at Indira, but the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and victory over Pakistan muted the critical voices. The company did not produce any vehicles during his lifetime. A test model put out as a showpiece to demonstrate progress was criticised. Public perception turned against Sanjay, and many began to speculate growing corruption. Sanjay then contacted Volkswagen AG from West Germany for a possible collaboration, transfer of technology and joint production of the Indian version of the \\"People's Car\\", to emulate Volkswagen's worldwide success with the Beetle. During the Emergency, Sanjay became active in politics and the Maruti project went on a back burner. There were accusations of nepotism and corruption. Finally, the Janata Government came to power in 1977 and \\"Maruti Limited\\" was liquidated. A commission was set up by the new government headed by Justice Alak Chandra Gupta which gave very critical report of the Maruti affair. A year after his death in 1980, and at the behest of Indira, the Union government salvaged Maruti Limited and started looking for an active collaborator for a new company. Maruti Udyog Ltd. was incorporated in the same year through the efforts of Nehru Gandhi family friend and industrial doyen V. Krishnamurthy.The Maruti Udyog official Website Timeline Page The Japanese company Suzuki was also contacted to present the design and feasibility of their car to be manufactured in India. When Suzuki learned that the Government of India had contacted Volkswagen as well, it did everything to pip the German company in the race to produce India's first People's Car (Maruti 800). It provided the government a feasible Design of their 'Model 796', which was also successful in Japan and East Asian countries. Role during emergency Gandhi with Shaikh Shamim Ahmed In 1974, the opposition-led protests and strikes had caused a widespread disturbance in many parts of the country and badly affected the government and the economy. On 25 June 1975 following an adverse court decision against her, Indira Gandhi declared a national emergency, delayed elections, censored the press and suspended some constitutional freedoms in the name of national security. Non-Congress governments throughout the country were dismissed. Thousands of people, including several freedom fighters like Jaya Prakash Narayan and Jivatram Kripalani who were against the Emergency were arrested. In the extremely hostile political environment just before and soon after the Emergency, Sanjay Gandhi rose in importance as Indira's adviser. With the defections of former loyalists, Sanjay's influence with Indira and the government increased dramatically, although he was never in an official or elected position. According to Mark Tully, \\"His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.\\"Mark Tully Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle, p. 55, It was said that during the Emergency, he virtually ran India along with his friends, especially Bansi Lal. It was also quipped that Sanjay Gandhi had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office). He \\"recruited into the party thousands of younger people, many of them hooligans and ruffians, who used threats and force to intimidate rivals and those who opposed Mrs Gandhi's authority or his own.\\" During the emergency, Indira Gandhi declared a 20-point economic programme for development. Sanjay also declared his own much shorter five points program promoting * Literacy * Family planning *Tree Planting * Eradication of Casteism * Abolition of dowry Later during the emergency Sanjay's programme was merged with Indira's 20-point programme to make a combined twenty-five point programme. Out of the five points, Sanjay is now chiefly remembered for the family planning initiative that attracted much notoriety and caused longterm harm to population control in India. Involvement in politics and government Although he had not been elected and held no office, Sanjay began exercising his new-found influence with Cabinet ministers, high-level government officials and police officers. While many Cabinet ministers and officials resigned in protest,Moro, Javier (2015) The red sari. Roli Group, 429 p. Sanjay reportedly appointed their successors. In one famous example, Inder Kumar Gujral resigned from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting when Sanjay attempted to direct the affairs of his ministry and give him orders. Gujral is reported to have angrily rebuked Sanjay and refused to take orders from an unelected person. Gujral was replaced by Vidya Charan Shukla, a Sanjay Gandhi acolyte. In another incident, after popular Bollywood singer Kishore Kumar refused to sing at a function of the Indian Youth Congress, his songs were banned on All India Radio upon Gandhi's insistence.R. Guha (2008). India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy. Pan Macmillan. Sanjay stood for his first election to the Indian parliament following the lifting of the Emergency in March 1977. This election saw the crushing defeat of not only Sanjay in his constituency of Amethi but also the wiping out of Indira's Congress party throughout Northern India. However, Sanjay won Amethi for the Congress(I) in the next general election held in January 1980. Just one month before his death, he was appointed secretary general of the Congress Party in May 1980. Jama Masjid beautification and slum demolition Sanjay Gandhi and Brij Vardhan, accompanied by Jagmohan the vice-chairman of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), was reportedly irked during his visit to Turkman Gate in old Delhi area that he couldn't see the grand old Jama Masjid because of the maze of tenements. On 13 April 1976, the DDA team bulldozed the tenements. Police resorted to firing to quell the demonstrations opposing the destruction. The firing resulted in at least 150 deaths. Over 70,000 people were displaced during this episode. The displaced inhabitants were moved to a new undeveloped housing site across the Yamuna river. Compulsory sterilization program In September 1976, Sanjay Gandhi initiated a widespread compulsory sterilization program to limit population growth. The exact extent of Sanjay Gandhi's role in the implementation of the program is somewhat disputed, with some writers holding Gandhi directly responsible for his authoritarianism, and other writers blaming the officials who implemented the program rather than Gandhi himself. David Frum and Vinod Mehta state that the sterilization programmes were initiated at the behest of the IMF and the World Bank: Attempted assassination Sanjay Gandhi escaped an assassination attempt in March 1977. Unknown gunmen fired at his car about 300 miles south-east of New Delhi during his election campaign. Opposition years (1977-1980) After losing the 1977 general election, the Congress party split again with Indira Gandhi floating her own Congress(I) faction. She won a by-election from the Chikmagalur Constituency to the Lok Sabha in November 1978 However, the Janata government's Home Minister, Charan Singh, ordered her and Sanjay arrested on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament.However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long- running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. Kissa Kursi Ka case Kissa Kursi Ka is a satirical film directed by Amrit Nahata that lampooned Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. The film was submitted to the Censor Board for certification in April 1975. The film had lampooned Sanjay Gandhi's car manufacturing plans, besides Congress supporters like Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari, private secretary to Indira Gandhi R.K. Dhawan, and Rukhsana Sultana. The board sent the film to a seven-member revising committee, which further sent it to the Government. Subsequently, a show-cause notice raising 51 objections was sent to the producer by the Information and Broadcasting ministry. In his reply submitted on 11 July 1975, Nahata stated that the characters were \\"imaginary and do not refer to any political party or persons\\". By the time, the Emergency had already been declared. Subsequently, all the prints and the master-print of the film at Censor Board office were picked up, and brought to Maruti factory in Gurgaon where they were burned. The subsequent Shah Commission, established in 1977 by the Janata party led Government of India, to enquire into excesses committed in the Indian Emergency found Sanjay guilty of burning the negative, along with V. C. Shukla, Information and Broadcasting minister during the emergency. The legal case ran for 11 months, and the court gave its judgment on 27 February 1979. Both Sanjay Gandhi and Shukla were sentenced to a two-year plus a month prison sentence. Sanjay Gandhi was denied bail. In his judgment, District Judge, O. N. Vohra at Tis Hazari in Delhi, found the accused guilty of \\"criminal conspiracy, breach of trust, mischief by fire, dishonestly receiving criminal property, concealing stolen property and disappearance of evidence\\". The verdict was later overturned. Support for Charan Singh The Janata coalition under prime minister Morarji Desai was only united by its hatred of Indira Gandhi.The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the RSS. The ambitious Union Finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting different Congress factions including Congress (I). After a significant exodus from Janata party to Charan Singh's faction, Morarji Desai resigned as prime minister in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay promised Singh that Congress(I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions. The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay. Since Charan Singh refused to drop the charges, Congress withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979. Before the 1980 elections Gandhi approached the then Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Syed Abdullah Bukhari and entered into an agreement with him on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes. In the elections held in January, Congress returned to power with a landslide majority. 1980 Indian elections The Congress(I) under Gandhi swept to power in January 1980. Elections soon after to legislative assemblies in States ruled by opposition parties brought back Congress ministries to those states. Sanjay Gandhi at that time selected his own loyalists to head the governments in these states. Personal life Sanjay Gandhi married Maneka Anand, who was 10 years his junior, in New Delhi in October 1974. Their son, Varun Gandhi, was born shortly before Sanjay's death. Maneka and Varun Gandhi represent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha. A hitherto unknown chapter of his personal life was revealed in January 2017, when Priya Singh Paul claimed that Sanjay Gandhi was her biological father, and that she was given away by her biological family for adoption. In June 2017, she gave a legal notice in her capacity as his daughter to stop the release of a film on Sanjay Gandhi. Death Sanjay Gandhi died instantly from head wounds in an air crash on 23 June 1980 near Safdarjung Airport in New Delhi. He was flying a new aircraft of the Delhi Flying club, and, while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre over his office, lost control and crashed. Sanjay was a novice pilot but given to flashy daredevilry and dangerous low-flying. His elder brother Rajiv Gandhi had repeatedly warned Sanjay to wear proper shoes and not Kolhapuri chappals in the cockpit. Sanjay chose to ignore his advice. He was clad in kurta-pyjama and Kolhapuri chappals when he got into the advanced Pitts S-2A aircraft. He flew low and indulged in some reckless manoeuvres before crashing. Sanjay died instantly. It took eight surgeons four hours to stitch up his mutilated body.[Vinod Mehta \\"The Sanjay Story, 2015 Harper Collins Publishers India.] The only passenger in the plane, Captain Subhash Saxena, also died in the crash. WikiLeaks has revealed that three attempts were made on his life before he died in the plane crash. According to Maneka Gandhi, Sanjay wanted to raise his children in the Zoroastrian faith of his family. Sanjay's death led his mother to induct her other son Rajiv Gandhi into Indian politics. After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv succeeded her as Prime Minister of India. Sanjay's widow Maneka fell out with her in-laws soon after Sanjay's death and started her own party named Sanjay Vichar Manch in Hyderabad. Maneka served in a number of non-Congress opposition-led governments over the years. Currently, she and her son Varun are members of the BJP, which is the current ruling party in India. Maneka was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Women and Child Development by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2014, she currently represents BJP from Sultanpur (Lok Sabha constituency) in Uttar Pradesh. Varun is a BJP member of Parliament from Pilibhit Constituency in Uttar Pradesh.

It is made with red meat, traditionally lamb or goat. It is coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower or root and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. Etymology A number of origins of the name have been suggested. Roughan means \\"clarified butter\\" or \\"oil\\" in Persian and Urdu, while ju≈° (alternatively romanised josh) means to \\"stew\\" or \\"braise\\"From Bonbon to Cha- cha: The Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases, Oxford:OUP, 2009, p.297 and ultimately derives from the verb ju≈°idan meaning \\"to boil\\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \\"stewed in ghee\\". An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the Urdu word roghan (), \\"brown\\" or \\"red\\", or the Kashmiri roghan, \\"red\\", along with the word either for \\"meat\\", (go≈°t) often romanized as \\"rogan ghosht\\" or \\"gosht\\", or a word meaning \\"juice\\", giving possible meanings of \\"red meat\\" or \\"red juice\\". The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \\"rogan josh\\" and \\"rogan ghosht\\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.Ayto, The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink, Oxford: OUP, 2012, p.309 Origin Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the wazwan). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude. Preparation Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (cloves, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yogurt. After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow cooking technique.Singh (1973), p.58 Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot) and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chilies (lal mirch). These chilies, whose flavor approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried cayenne pepper of Indian cuisine. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. There are significant differences in preparation between the Hindu and Muslim dishes in Kashmir: Muslims use praan, a local form of shallot and petals of maval, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \\"cooling\\" effect); Hindus eschew these, along with garlic and onions, but may add yogurt to give additional body and flavour. Adaptations While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non- traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipeRecipe Source: Rogan Josh - Madhur Jaffrey calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves. Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included. However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes, while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one. With other meats In India, rogan josh is often made with goat instead of mutton, since genuine lamb is less widely available than goat meat. There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.

It lies southeast of South Georgia Island. It is the northernmost of the South Sandwich Islands and the nearest to South Georgia. The island is home to around a million pairs of breeding chinstrap penguins, which is the largest besides Antarctica. View of Mount Asphyxia History Zavodovski Island was discovered and named by Russian Antarctic explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on December 23, 1819. Bellingshausen named it after Captain- Lieutenant Ivan Zavadovskiy, who was captain of his ship, the Imperial Russian Navy sloop-of-war Vostok. A group of three members of the expedition, Captain- Lieutenant Ivan Zavadovskiy, astronomer Prof. Ivan Simonov, and Leutenant Dmitriy Demidov, landed on the island on December 24, 1820 and collected speciments of volcanic rocks, and caught some birds and penguins. The American schooner Pacific under Captain James Brown landed at Zavodovski Island in 1830. The island was surveyed in 1930 by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel. The island's penguin colony was featured in the \\"Frozen Seas\\" episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary series The Blue Planet. It was subsequently featured in the \\"Islands\\" episode of the 2016 follow-up documentary Planet Earth II. A volcanic eruption was identified on the island on 2 May 2012, though the size of the eruption is unknown. The volcano erupted again in March 2016; by July, between one third and one half of the island was covered in ash, putting the penguin colonies at risk. Geography Plume from Zavodovski volcano The island is largely unglaciated. It is approximately across with a peak elevation of above sea level. Many of the island's headlands have been charted and named, generally in recognition of the island's odorous volcanic fumes. Unless noted otherwise, the following names were applied by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC). Low-lying Reek Point is the island's northernmost point. Pacific Point is a small rounded point on the island's northwest side. It was initially named Low Point by DI personnel, but was renamed for the Pacific in 1953 by UK-APC to avoid redundancy with other similarly named features. Low-lying Acrid Point is found to the southwest. Stench Point is a conspicuous point forming the west extremity of the island. Originally named West Bluff in by DI personnel, it was renamed in 1971 by UK-APC to avoid duplication. Noxious Bluff is a dark bluff high on the island's southwest coast. Fume Point is a low-lying lava feature forming the island's southern point. Pungent Point, a low, dark- colored lava cliff, forms the island's east point. Mount Asphyxia, a stratovolcano also known as Mount Curry, dominates the western side of the island while the eastern half is a low-lying lava plain. It is an active volcano, with fresh lava reported in 1830 and numerous indications of activity since. Approximately 50% of the island is composed of tephra, a fragmental material produced by volcanic eruptions.

Philippe Le Billon describes a war economy as a \\"system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain the violence.\\" Some measures taken include the increasing of Taylor rates as well as the introduction of resource allocation programs. Approaches to the reconfiguration of the economy differ from country to country. Many states increase the degree of planning in their economies during wars; in many cases this extends to rationing, and in some cases to conscription for civil defenses, such as the Women's Land Army and Bevin Boys in the United Kingdom during World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated if the Axis powers won, then \\"we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy.\\" During total war situations, certain buildings and positions are often seen as important targets by combatants. The Union blockade, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea during the American Civil War, and the strategic bombing of enemy cities and factories during World War II are all examples of total war. Concerning the side of aggregate demand, this concept has been linked to the concept of \\"military Keynesianism\\", in which the government's military budget stabilizes business cycles and fluctuations and/or is used to fight recessions. On the supply side, it has been observed that wars sometimes have the effect of accelerating progress of technology to such an extent that an economy is greatly strengthened after the war, especially if it has avoided the war-related destruction. This was the case, for example, with the United States in World War I and World War II. Some economists (such as Seymour Melman) argue, however, that the wasteful nature of much of military spending eventually can hurt technological progress. War is often used as a last ditch effort to prevent deteriorating economic conditions or currency crises, particularly by expanding services and employment in the military, and by simultaneously depopulating segments of the population to free up resources and restore the economic and social order.  United States  The United States alone has a very complex history with wartime economies. Many notable instances came during the twentieth century in which America's main conflicts consisted of the World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam.  World War I  U.S. Food Administration, educational division poster In mobilizing for World War I, the United States expanded its governmental powers by creating institutions such as the War Industries Board (WIB) to help with military production. Others, such as the Fuel Administration, introduced daylight saving time in an effort to save coal and oil while the Food Administration encouraged higher grain production and ‚Äúmobilized a spirit of self-sacrifice rather than mandatory rationing.‚Äù Propaganda also played a large part in garnering support for topics ranging from tax initiatives to food conservation. Speaking on Four Minute Men, volunteers who rallied the public through short speeches, investigative journalist George Creel stated that the idea was extremely popular and the program saw thousands of volunteers throughout the states. World War II In the case of the Second World War, the U.S. government took similar measures in increasing its control over the economy. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor provided the spark needed to begin conversion to a wartime economy. With this attack, Washington felt that a greater bureaucracy was needed to help with mobilization. The government raised taxes which paid for half of the war's costs and borrowed money in the form of war bonds to cover the rest of the bill. ‚ÄúCommercial institutions like banks also bought billions of dollars of bonds and other treasury paper, holding more than $24 billion at the war‚Äôs end.\\" The creation of a handful of agencies helped funnel resources towards the war effort. One prominent agency was the War Production Board (WPB), which ‚Äúawarded defense contracts, allocated scarce resources ‚Äì such as rubber, copper, and oil ‚Äì for military uses, and persuaded businesses to convert to military production.\\" Two-thirds of the American economy had been integrated into the war effort by the end of 1943. Because of this massive cooperation between government and private entities, it could be argued that the economic measures enacted prior to and during the Second World War helped lead the Allies to victory. Present Day The United States has been involved in numerous military endeavours within the Middle East and Latin America since the 1960s. Having been in a continuous state of war since the September 11 Attackshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/opinion/americas-forever-wars.html and having a military budget over double of its two largest military rivals.  Germany   World War I  Germany has experienced economic devastation following both World Wars. While this was not a result of faulty economic planning, it is important to understand the ways that Germany approached reconstruction. In World War I, the German agricultural sector was hit hard by the demands of the war effort. Not only were many of the workers conscripted, but much of the food itself was allocated for the troops leading to a shortage. ‚ÄúGerman authorities were not able to solve the food scarcity [problem], but implemented a food rationing system and several price ceilings to prevent speculation and profiteering. Unfortunately, these measures did not have the desired success.\\"  World War II  Heading into the Second World War, the Nazis introduced new policies that not only caused the unemployment rate to drop, it created a competent war machine in clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Third Reich implemented a draft and built factories to supply its quickly expanding military. Both of these actions created jobs for many Germans who had been struggling from the economic collapse following World War I. However, it is worth noting that while unemployment rates plummeted, ‚Äúby 1939, government debt stood at over 40 billion Reichsmarks (equivalent to billion euros).\\" After World War II, Germany was discovered to have exploited the economies of the countries it invaded. The most important among these, according to historians Boldorf and Scherner, was France and ‚Äúher highly developed economy‚Ä¶ [being] one of the biggest in Europe.‚Äù This is further supported when they later reveal how the French economy provided for 11 percent of Germany's national income (during the occupation) which covered five months of Germany's total income for the war. Using extortion and forced labor, the Nazis siphoned off much of France's economic output. For example, during the early months of the Nazi occupation, the French puppet government was forced to pay a \\"quartering\\" fee of twenty million Reichmarks per day. Supposedly, the fee was payment for the Nazi occupation forces. In reality, the money was used to fuel the Nazi war economy. Germany employed numerous methods to support its war effort. However, due to the Nazis' surrender to the Allies, it is hard to tell what their economic policies would have yielded in the long term.

Known for his fragmented sculptures of the human body often created for large- scale public installations, he is considered one of the most internationally recognized Polish sculptors. Biography Mitoraj was born on 26 March 1944 in Oederan, Germany. His Polish mother was a forced labourer, while his father was a French officer of Polish extraction. He returned with his mother to Poland after the end of World War II. He spent his childhood years in Grojec. He graduated from an art school in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça and in 1963 he studied painting at the Krak√≥w Academy of Art under Tadeusz Kantor. After graduating, he had several joint exhibitions, and held his first solo exhibition in 1967 at the Krzysztofory Gallery in Poland. In 1968, he moved to Paris to continue his studies at the National School of Art. Shortly afterwards, he became fascinated by Latin American art and culture, spending a year painting and travelling around Mexico. The experience led him to take up sculpture. He returned to Paris in 1974 and two years later he held another major solo exhibition at the Gallery La Hune, including some sculptural work. The success of the show persuaded him that he was first and foremost a sculptor. Having previously worked with terracotta and bronze, a trip to Carrara, Italy, in 1979 turned him to using marble as his primary medium and in 1983 he set up a studio in Pietrasanta. In 2006, he created the new bronze doors and a statue of John the Baptist for the basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome. In 2003 he returned to Poland. In 2005 he received the Golden Medal of Medal for Merit to Culture - Gloria Artis 2012 he received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Style Mitoraj's sculptural style is rooted in the classical tradition with its focus on the well modelled torso. However, Mitoraj introduced a post-modern twist with ostentatiously truncated limbs, emphasising the damage sustained by most genuine classical sculptures. Often his works aim to address the questions of human body, its beauty and fragility, its suffering as well as deeper aspects of human nature, which as a result of the passing of time undergo degeneration.

Their goal was to win the support of the Allied Powers for the independence of Bohemia and Moravia from the Austrian Empire and of Slovak territories from the Kingdom of Hungary, which were then part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. With the help of √©migr√© intellectuals and politicians such as the Czech Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk and the Slovak Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik, they grew into a force of over 100,000 strong. In Russia, they took part in several victorious battles of the war, including the Zborov and Bakhmach against the Central Powers, and were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War fighting Bolsheviks, at times controlling the entire Trans-Siberian railway and several major cities in Siberia. After three years of existence as a small unit in the Imperial Russian Army, the Legion in Russia was established in 1917, with other troops fighting in France since the beginning of the war as the \\"Nazdar\\" company, and similar units later emerging in Italy and Serbia. Originally an all-volunteer force, these formations were later strengthened by Czech and Slovak prisoners of war or deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army. The majority of the legionaries were Czechs, with Slovaks making up 7% of the force in Russia, 3% in Italy and 16% in France. The name Czechoslovak Legion preceded and anticipated the creation of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak Legion in Russia Activity in World War I, 1914‚Äì1918 Memorial for the dead of the Czechoslovak Legion in the battle of Zborov (1917) at the Kalinivka cemetery, Ukraine As World War I broke out, national societies representing ethnic Czechs and Slovaks residing in the Russian Empire petitioned the Russian government to support the independence of their homelands. To prove their loyalty to the Entente cause, these groups advocated the establishment of a unit of Czech and Slovak volunteers to fight alongside the Russian Army.John Bradley, The Czechoslovak Legion in Russia 1914‚Äì1920 (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1990) 14‚Äì16. Memorial to the Czechoslovaks in the battle of Zborov at Blansko, Czech Republic. A memorial plaque to the Battle of Bakhmach in Olomouc On 5 August 1914, the Russian Stavka authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. This unit, called the \\"Czech Companions\\" (ƒåesk√° dru≈æina or Dru≈æina), went to the front in October 1914, where it was attached to the Russian Third Army.Josef Kalvoda, The Genesis of Czechoslovakia (Boulder: East European Monographs, 1986) 62‚Äì63. There the Dru≈æina soldiers served in scattered patrols performing a number of specialized duties, including reconnaissance, prisoner interrogation and subversion of enemy troops in the opposite trenches.Bradley, Czechoslovak Legion, 41. From its start, Czech and Slovak political √©migr√©s in Russia and Western Europe desired to expand the Dru≈æina from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To achieve this goal, however, they recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the Dru≈æina to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro- Hungarian Army, but this order was rescinded after only a few weeks due to opposition from other branches of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts of √©migr√© leaders to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917. Still, some Czechs and Slovaks were able to sidestep this ban by enlisting POWs through local agreements with Russian military authorities.Brent Mueggenberg, The Czecho-Slovak Struggle for Independence 1914‚Äì1920 (Jefferson: McFarland, 2014) 67‚Äì70. Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914‚Äì1917. In early 1916, the Dru≈æina was reorganized as the 1st Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. During that year, two more infantry regiments were added, creating the Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade (ƒåeskoslovensk√° st≈ôeleck√° brig√°da). This unit distinguished itself during the Kerensky Offensive in July 1917, when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches during the Battle of Zborov.Mueggenberg, Czecho-Slovak Struggle, 86‚Äì90. Following the soldiers' stellar performance at Zborov, the Russian Provisional Government finally granted their √©migr√© leaders on the Czechoslovak National Council permission to mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω sbor na Rusi), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (ƒåeskoslovensk√° legie) in Russia. A second division, consisting of four regiments, was added to the Legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.Kalvoda, Genesis, 101‚Äì105. Evacuation from Bolshevik Russia In November 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power throughout Russia and soon began peace negotiations with the Central Powers at Brest- Litovsk. The chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council, Tom√°≈° Masaryk, who had arrived in Russia earlier that year, began planning for the Legion's departure from Russia and transfer to France so the Czechoslovaks could continue to fight against the Central Powers. Since most of Russia's main ports were blockaded, Masaryk decided that the Legion should travel from Ukraine to the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where the men would embark on transport vessels that would carry them to Western Europe.Victor M. Fic, Revolutionary War and the Russian Question (New Delhi: Abhinav, 1977) 36‚Äì39. Troop movements in the Russian Civil War. The dark grey lines show the maximum advance of the White forces, including the Czechoslovaks. In February 1918, Bolshevik authorities in Ukraine granted Masaryk and his troops permission to begin the journey to Vladivostok.Tom√°≈° Masaryk, The Making of a State, Translated by Henry Wickham Steed (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1927) 177. However, on 18 February, before the Czechoslovaks had left Ukraine, the German Army launched Operation Faustschlag (fist strike) on the Eastern Front to force the Soviet government to accept its terms for peace. From 5 to 13 March, the Czechoslovak legionaries successfully fought off German attempts to prevent their evacuation in the Battle of Bakhmach.Henry Baerlein, The March of the Seventy Thousand (London: Leonard Parsons, 1926) 101‚Äì103, 128‚Äì129. After leaving Ukraine and entering Soviet Russia, representatives of the Czechoslovak National Council continued to negotiate with Bolshevik authorities in Moscow and Penza to iron out the details of the corps' evacuation. On 25 March, the two sides signed the Penza Agreement, in which the legionaries were to surrender most of their weapons in exchange for unmolested passage to Vladivostok. Tensions continued to mount, however, as each side distrusted the other. The Bolsheviks, despite Masaryk's order for the legionaries to remain neutral in Russia's affairs, suspected that the Czechoslovaks might join their counterrevolutionary enemies in the borderlands. Meanwhile, the legionaries were wary of Czechoslovak Communists who were trying to subvert the corps. They also suspected that the Bolsheviks were being pressured by the Central Powers to stall their movement towards Vladivostok.Victor M. Fic, The Bolsheviks and the Czechoslovak Legion (New Delhi: Abhinav, 1978) 22‚Äì38. By May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion was strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway from Penza to Vladivostok. Their evacuation was proving much slower than expected due to dilapidated railway conditions, a shortage of locomotives and the recurring need to negotiate with local soviets along the route. On 14 May, a dispute at the Chelyabinsk station between legionaries heading east and Magyar POWs heading west to be repatriated caused the People's Commissar for War, Leon Trotsky, to order the complete disarmament and arrest of the legionaries. At an army congress that convened in Chelyabinsk a few days later, the Czechoslovaks ‚Äì against the wishes of the National Council ‚Äì refused to disarm and began issuing ultimatums for their passage to Vladivostok.Fic, Bolsheviks, 230‚Äì261. This incident sparked the Revolt of the Legions. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia killed by bolsheviks at Nikolsk-Ussuriysky, 1918. Above them stands also members of the Czechoslovak Legion. Czechoslovak troops in Vladivostok (1918) Fighting between the Czechoslovak Legion and the Bolsheviks erupted at several points along the Trans-Siberian Railway in the last days of May 1918. By June, the two sides were fighting along the railway route from Penza to Krasnoyarsk. By the end of the month, legionaries under General Mikhail Diterikhs had taken control of Vladivostok, overthrowing the local Bolshevik administration. On July 6, the Legion declared the city to be an Allied protectorate, and legionnaires began returning across the Trans- Siberian Railway to support their comrades fighting to their west. Generally, the Czechoslovaks were the victors in their early engagements against the fledgling Red Army. By mid-July, the legionaries had seized control of the railway from Samara to Irkutsk, and by the beginning of September they had cleared Bolshevik forces from the entire length of the Trans-Siberian Railway.Mueggenberg, Czecho-Slovak Struggle, 161‚Äì177, 188‚Äì191. Legionnaires conquered all the large cities of Siberia, including Yekaterinburg, but Tsar Nicholas II and his family were executed on the direct orders of Vladimir Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov less than a week before the arrival of the Legion. Involvement in the Russian Civil War, 1918‚Äì1919 armored train \\"Orl√≠k\\", Russia News of the Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia during the summer of 1918 was welcomed by Allied statesmen in Great Britain and France, who saw the operation as a means to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany.George Kennan, Soviet-American Relations: The Decision to Intervene (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1958) 357‚Äì358, 382‚Äì384. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who had resisted earlier Allied proposals to intervene in Russia, gave in to domestic and foreign pressure to support the legionaries' evacuation from Siberia. In early July 1918, he published an aide-m√©moire calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in Transbaikal.Kennan, Decision to Intervene, 395‚Äì408. But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, the Czechoslovaks were already there to welcome them. The Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn 1918, there were 70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region. Many of these contingents supported anti-Bolshevik Russians and Cossack warlords who had established regional governments in the wake of the Czechoslovak seizure of the Trans-Siberian Railway.Benjamin Isitt, From Victoria to Vladivostok: Canada's Siberian Expedition, 1917‚Äì19 (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press). The Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia impressed Allied statesmen and attracted them to the idea of an independent Czechoslovak state. As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another that summer, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.Mueggenberg, Czecho- Slovak Struggle, 185‚Äì188. Capture of Imperial Gold Reserve Shortly after they entered into hostilities against the Bolsheviks, the legionaries began making common cause with anti-Bolshevik, or White, Russians who began forming their own governments behind the Czechoslovaks' lines. The most important of these governments were the Komuch in Samara and the Provisional Siberian Government in Omsk. With substantial Czechoslovak help, the People's Army of Komuch won several important victories, including the capture of Kazan and an Imperial state gold reserve on 5 August 1918. Czechoslovak pressure was also crucial in convincing the White Russians in Siberia to nominally unify behind the All-Russian Provisional Government, formed at a conference in Ufa during September 1918.Orlando Figes, A People's Tragedy (New York: Viking, 1997) 580‚Äì581. Banner of the First Assault Battalion of Czechoslovak Legions adopted on 2 February 1919 in Yekaterinburg During the autumn of 1918, the legionaries' enthusiasm for the fighting in Russia, then mostly confined along the Volga and Urals, dropped precipitously. The professor T. G. Masaryk supported them from the United States of America.PRECL√çK, Vratislav. Masaryk a legie (Masaryk and legions), v√°z. kniha, 219 str., vydalo nakladatelstv√≠ Paris Karvin√°, ≈Ωi≈ækova 2379 (734 01 Karvin√°) ve spolupr√°ci s Masarykov√Ωm demokratick√Ωm hnut√≠m (Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague), 2019, , pages 124 - 128,140 - 148,184 - 190 The rapidly growing Red Army was getting stronger by the day, retaking Kazan on 10 September, followed by Samara a month later.Mueggenberg, Czecho-Slovak Struggle, 196‚Äì197. The legionaries, whose strength had peaked at around 61,000 earlier that year,Josef Kalvoda, \\"Czech and Slovak Prisoners of War in Russia during the War and Revolution\\", Peter Pastor, ed., Essays on World War I (New York: Brooklyn College Press, 1983) 225. were lacking reliable reinforcements from POW camps and were disappointed by the failure of Allied soldiers from other countries to join them on the front lines. On 28 October, Czechoslovak statehood was declared in Prague, arousing the troops with a desire to return to their homeland. The final blow to Czechoslovak morale arrived on 18 November 1918, when a coup in Omsk overthrew the All-Russian Provisional Government and installed a dictatorship under Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in control of White Siberia.Mueggenberg, Czecho-Slovak Struggle, 215‚Äì225. During the winter of 1918‚Äì1919, the Czechoslovak troops were redeployed from the front to guard the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway between Novonikolaevsk and Irkutsk from partisan attacks. Alongside other legions formed from Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav POWs in Siberia, the Czechoslovaks defended the Kolchak government's only supply route for the duration of 1919.Mueggenberg, Czecho-Slovak Struggle, 249. During the summer and autumn of 1919, Kolchak's armies were in a steady retreat from the Red Eastern Army Group. On 14 November, the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak's capital, initiating a desperate eastward flight by the White army and refugees along the Trans-Siberian Railway. In the following weeks, the Whites' rear was further disorganized by widespread outbreaks of uprisings and partisan activity. The homesick legionaries, who simply wanted to leave Siberia without incurring any more casualties than necessary, declared their neutrality amid the unrest and did nothing to suppress the rebellions. Meanwhile, Kolchak's trains, which included the gold bullion captured from Kazan, were stranded along the railway near Nizhneudinsk. After his bodyguard deserted him there, the legionaries were ordered by Allied representatives in Siberia to safely escort the admiral to Vladivostok. This plan was resisted by insurgents along the Czechoslovaks' route, and as a result the legionaries, after consulting their commanders, Generals Janin and Jan Syrov√Ω, made the controversial decision to turn Kolchak over to the Political Center, a government formed by Socialists-Revolutionaries in Irkutsk. On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin, whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks unmolested passage to Vladivostok. In exchange, the legionaries agreed to not try to rescue Kolchak and to leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk. Earlier that day, Kolchak had been executed by a Cheka firing squad to prevent his rescue by a small White army then on the outskirts of the city.Jonathon Smele, Civil War in Siberia (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996) 544‚Äì665. Evacuation from Vladivostok, 1920 When the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, dozens of Czechoslovak trains were still west of Irkutsk. On 1 March 1920, the last Czechoslovak train passed through that city. The legionaries' progress was still hampered at times by the Japanese Expeditionary Force and the troops of Ataman Grigori Semenov, who stalled the Czechoslovak trains to delay the arrival of the Red Army in Eastern Siberia. By then, however, the evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok was well underway, and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. The total number of people evacuated with the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was 67,739; including 56,455 soldiers, 3,004 officers, 6,714 civilians, 1,716 wives, 717 children, 1,935 foreigners and 198 others.Bradley, Czechoslovak Legion, 156. After their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new Czechoslovak Army. The number of legionaries killed in Russia during World War I and the Russian Civil War amounted to 4,112. An unknown number went missing or deserted the legion, either to make an arduous journey to return home or to join the Czechoslovak Communists.Joan McGuire Mohr, The Czech and Slovak Legion in Siberia 1917‚Äì1922 (Jefferson: McFarland, 2012) 157. Among the latter was Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, later the author of the satirical novel The Good Soldier ≈†vejk. Czechoslovak Legion in France Czechoslovak Legions in France In France, the Czechs and Slovaks who wanted to fight Austria-Hungary were allowed to join the Foreign Legion (hence originated the term Legion for units of Czechoslovak volunteers). In 31 August 1914, the 1st Company of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Foreign Legion in Bayonne was created mostly of the Czechs and was nicknamed \\"rota Nazdar\\" (\\"Nazdar!\\" Company). The company distinguished itself in heavy combat during assaults near Arras on May 9 and June 16, 1915. Because of heavy casualties, the Company was disbanded, and volunteers continued to fight in various French units. New autonomous Czechoslovak units were established by the decree of the French government in 19 December 1917. In January 1918, the 21st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was formed in the town of Cognac; it mixed prisoners of war with volunteers living in America. The 22nd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was created later in May. Czechoslovak Legion in Italy Czechoslovak Legions in Italy The creation of Czechoslovak units in Italy took place much later than in France or in Russia. In January 1918, the commander of 6th Italian Army decided to form small reconnaissance groups from Czech, Slovak and Southern Slav volunteers from POW camps. They also served in propaganda actions against Austrian army. In September 1918, first fighting unit, the 39th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Italian Legion was formed of those volunteer reconnaissance squadrons. Italian legionaries were the first who returned to newly created Czechoslovakia in 1918 and were immediately drafted into fights for new state borders. Most notably in the war against Hungarian Soviet Republic.

Members of the legions formed a significant part of the new Czechoslovak Army. Many of them fought in 1919 in the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War over Zaolzie and in a war with Hungary over Slovakia. Legion veterans formed organizations such as the Association of Czechoslovak Legionnaires (ƒåeskoslovensk√° obec legion√°≈ôsk√°) and Legiobanka (Legion√°≈ôsk√° banka, a bank formed with the capital they had gathered during their long service). These and other organizations were known as the Hrad (\\"The [Prague] Castle\\") for their support of the President of Czechoslovakia. In literature The 2005 novel The People's Act of Love, by the British writer James Meek, describes the occupation of a small Siberian town by a company of the Czechoslovak Legion in 1919. The original inhabitants of the town are members of the Christian sect of Skoptsy, or castrates.

The U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 8, 2011 river drains almost of southern Kentucky and north-central Tennessee. The river flows generally west from a source in the Appalachian Mountains to its confluence with the Ohio River near Paducah, Kentucky, and the mouth of the Tennessee River. Major tributaries include the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, and Red rivers. Although the Cumberland River basin is predominantly rural, there are also some large cities on the river, including Nashville and Clarksville, both in Tennessee. Also, the river system has been extensively developed for flood control, with major dams impounding both the main stem and many of its important tributaries. Geography Its headwaters are three separate forks that begin in Kentucky and converge in Baxter, KY, located in Harlan County. Martin's Fork starts near Hensley Settlement on Brush Mountain in Bell County and snakes its way north through the mountains to Baxter. Clover Fork starts on Black Mountain in Holmes Mill, near the Virginia border, and flows west in parallel with Kentucky Route 38 until it reaches Harlan. Clover Fork once flowed through downtown Harlan and merged with Martins Fork at the intersection of Kentucky Route 38 and US Route 421 until a flood control project began in 1992 diverted it through a tunnel under Little Black Mountain from which it emerges in Baxter and converges with Martins Fork. Poor Fork begins as a small stream on Pine Mountain in Letcher County near Flat Gap, Virginia. It flows southwest in parallel with Pine Mountain until it merges with the other two forks in Baxter. Confluence of the Cumberland River at BaxterFrom there, the wider, now named Cumberland River continues flowing west through the mountains of Kentucky before turning northward toward Cumberland Falls. The falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the southeastern United States and is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow can be seen.Cumberland Falls Moonbow Retrieved on 2010-05-29 Beyond Cumberland Falls, the river turns abruptly west once again and continues to grow as it converges with other creeks and streams. It receives the Laurel and Rockcastle rivers from the northeast and then the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River from the south. From here it flows into the man-made Lake Cumberland, formed by Wolf Creek Dam. The more than reservoir is one of the largest artificial lakes in the eastern US. Near Celina, the river crosses south into Tennessee, where it is joined by the Obey River and Caney Fork. Northeast of Nashville, the river is dammed twice more, forming Cordell Hull Lake and Old Hickory Lake. After flowing through Nashville and picking up the Stones River, the river is dammed to form Cheatham Lake. The river turns northwest toward Clarksville, where it is joined by the Red River, and then flows back into Kentucky at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, a section of land nestled between Lake Barkley, which is fed by the Cumberland River, and Kentucky Lake. Finally, the river flows north and merges with the Ohio River at Smithland, northeast of Paducah. History Barge traffic on the Cumberland River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the river for tug-and-barge navigation. The explorer Thomas Walker of Virginia in 1758 named the river, but whether for the Duke of Cumberland or the English county of Cumberland is not known. The Cumberland River was called Wasioto by the Shawnee Native Americans, who lived in this area. French traders called it the Riviere des Chaouanons, or \\"River of the Shawnee\\" for this association. The river was also known as the Shawnee River (or Shawanoe River) for years after Walker's trip. Important first as a passage for hunters and settlers, the Cumberland River also supported later riverboat trade, which traveled to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Villages, towns, and cities were located at landing points along its banks. Through the middle of the 19th century, settlers depended on rivers as the primary transportation routes for trading and travel.  Floods  In more recent history, a number of severe floods have struck various regions that the river flows through. In April 1977, Harlan, Kentucky, and many surrounding communities were inundated with floodwaters, destroying most of the homes and businesses within the floodplain of the river. This event led to the building of the Martins Fork Dam for flood control and the diversion of the Clover Fork around the city of Harlan. In addition, the river was diverted through a mountain cut in Loyall, Kentucky. In late April and early May 2010, due to the 2010 Tennessee floods, the river overflowed its banks and flooded Nashville and Clarksville, Tennessee. The downtown area was ordered to evacuate. Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg in early February 2020.

Its major products include MATLAB and Simulink, which support data analysis and simulation. History The company's key product, MATLAB, was created in the 1970s by Cleve Moler, who was chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico at the time. It was a free tool for academics. Jack Little, who would eventually found the company, came across the tool while he was a graduate student in electrical engineering at Stanford University. Little and Steve Bangert rewrote the code for MATLAB in C while they were colleagues at an engineering firm. They founded MathWorks along with Moler in 1984, with Little running it out of his house in Portola Valley, California. Little would mail diskettes in baggies (food storage bags) to the first customers. The company sold its first order, 10 copies of MATLAB, for $500 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in February 1985. A few years later, Little and the company moved to Massachusetts, and Little hired Jeanne O'Keefe, an experienced computer executive, to help formalize the business. By 1997, MathWorks was profitable, claiming revenue of around $50 million, and had around 380 employees. Natick In 1999, MathWorks relocated to the Apple Hill office complex in Natick, Massachusetts, purchasing additional buildings in the complex in 2008 and 2009, ultimately occupying the entire campus. MathWorks expanded further in 2013 by buying Boston Scientific's old headquarters campus, which is near to MathWorks' headquarters in Natick. By 2018, the company had around 3,000 employees in Natick and said it had revenues of around $900 million. Products The company's two lead products are MATLAB, which provides an environment for programmers to analyze and visualize data and develop algorithms, and Simulink, a graphical and simulation environment for model-based design of dynamic systems. MATLAB and Simulink are used in aerospace, automotive, software and other fields. The company's other products include Polyspace, SimEvents, and Stateflow. Corporate affairs Intellectual property and competition In 1999 the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against MathWorks and Wind River Systems alleging that an agreement between them violated antitrust laws. The agreement in question stipulated that the two companies agreed to stop competing in the field of dynamic control system design software, with MathWorks alone selling Wind River's Matrixx Software and that Wind River would stop all research and development and sales in that field. Both companies eventually settled with the Department of Justice and agreed to sell the MATRIXx software to a third party. MathWorks had total sales of $200 million in 2001, with dynamic control system design software accounting for half of those sales. MathWorks's Simulink software was found to have infringed 3 patents from National Instruments related to data flow diagrams in 2003, a decision which was confirmed by a court of appeal in 2004. In 2011, MathWorks sued AccelerEyes for copyright infringement in one court, and patent and trademark infringement in another. AccelerEyes accepted consent decrees in both cases before the trials began. In 2012, the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation into MathWorks after competitors alleged that Mathworks refused to grant licenses to its intellectual property that would allow people to create software with interoperability with its products. The case was closed in 2014. Logo The logo represents the first vibrational mode of a thin L-shaped membrane, clamped at the edges, and governed by the wave equation, which was the subject of Moler's thesis. Community The company annually sponsors a number of student engineering competitions, including EcoCAR, an advanced vehicle technology competition created by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). MathWorks sponsored the mathematics exhibit at London's Science Museum. In the coding community, MathWorks hosts MATLAB Central, an online exchange where users ask and answer questions and share code. MATLAB Central currently houses around than 145,000 questions in its MATLAB Answers database. The company actively supports numerous academic institutions to advance STEM education, including giving funding to MIT Open Courseware and MITx.

Early career Auguste Mariette was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where his father was town clerk. Educated at the Boulogne municipal college, where he distinguished himself and showed much artistic talent, he went to England in 1839 when eighteen as professor of French and drawing at a boys' school at Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1840 he became pattern-designer to a ribbon manufacturer in Coventry, but he returned the same year to Boulogne, and in 1841 took a degree at the University of Douai. Mariette proved to be a talented draftsman and designer, and he supplemented his salary as a teacher at Douai by giving private lessons and writing on historical and archaeological subjects for local periodicals. Meanwhile, his cousin Nestor L'H√¥te, the friend and fellow-traveller of Champollion, died, and the task of sorting his papers filled Mariette with a passion for Egyptology. Largely self-taught, he devoted himself to the study of hieroglyphics and Coptic. His 1847 analytic catalogue of the Egyptian Gallery of the Boulogne Museum got him a minor appointment at the Louvre Museum in 1849. First trip to Egypt Auguste Mariette (seated, far left) and Emperor Pedro II of Brazil (seated, far right) with others during the monarch's visit to the Giza Necropolis at the end of 1871. Entrusted with a government mission for the purpose of seeking and purchasing the best Coptic, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic manuscripts for the Louvre collection so that it retained its then-supremacy over other national collections, he set out for Egypt in 1850. After little success in acquiring manuscripts due to inexperience, to avoid an embarrassing return empty-handed to France and wasting what might be his only trip to Egypt, he visited temples and befriended a Bedouin tribe, who led him to Saqqara. The site initially looked \\"a spectacle of desolation...[and] mounds of sand\\" (his words), but on noticing one sphinx from the reputed avenue of sphinxes, that led to the ruins of the Serapeum at Saqqara near the step- pyramid, with its head above the sands, he gathered 30 workmen. Thus, in 1851, he made his celebrated discovery of this avenue and eventually the subterranean tomb-temple complex of catacombs with their spectacular sarcophagi of the Apis bulls. Breaking through the rubble at the tomb entrance on November 12, he entered the complex, finding thousands of statues, bronze tablets and other treasures, but only one intact sarcophagus. He also found the virtually intact tomb of Prince Khaemweset, Ramesses II's son. Accused of theft and destruction by rival diggers and by the Egyptian authorities, Mariette began to rebury his finds in the desert to keep them from these competitors. Instead of manuscripts, official French funds were now advanced for the prosecution of his researches, and he remained in Egypt for four years, excavating, discovering and despatching archaeological treasures to the Louvre, following the accepted Eurocentric convention. However, the French government and the Louvre set up an arrangement to divide the finds 50:50, so that upon his return to Paris 230 crates went to the Louvre (and he was raised to an assistant conservator), but an equal amount remained in Egypt. Director of Antiquities A statue of Auguste Mariette in his home city of Boulogne-sur-Mer. After his discoveries at Saqqara, Mariette could not be content with a purely academic role. He said: \\"I knew I would die or go mad if I did not return to Egypt immediately\\" and, after less than a year, he returned to Egypt at the insistence of the Egyptian government under Sa'id of Egypt, who created the position of Conservator of Egyptian monuments for him, in 1858. Moving with his family to Cairo, Mariette's career blossomed into a chronicle of unwearying exploration and brilliant successes: *gaining government funds open the museum in Cairo at Bulaq in 1863 in order to take the pressure off the sites and stop the trade in illicit antiquities.Egyptsites.co.uk *the pyramid-fields of Memphis and (exploiting his previous success to find a cache of ca. 2000BC painted wooden statues such as the Seated Scribe, and the decorated tomb of Khafra) the tombs of Saqqara *the necropolis of Meidum, and those of Abydos and Thebes *the great temples of Dendera and Edfu were disinterred *important excavations were carried out at Karnak (marking the first full Egyptian use of the stratigraphic methods first developed by Karl Richard Lepsius and of photographing every object prior to its excavation), Medinet-Habu and Deir el-Bahri *Tanis (the Egyptian capital in the Late Period) was partially explored in the Delta *even Gebel Barkal in Sudan was explored *He cleared the sands around the Sphinx down to the bare rock, and in the process discovered the famous granite and alabaster monument, the \\"Temple of the Sphinx\\". In 1860 alone, Mariette set up 35 new dig sites, whilst attempting to conserve already-dug sites. His success was aided by the fact that no rivals were permitted to dig in Egypt, a fact that the British (who had previously had the majority of Egyptologists active in the country) and Germans (who were politically allied with the country's Ottoman rulers) protested at as a 'sweetheart deal' between Egypt and France. Nor were Mariette's relations with the Khedive always stable. The Khedive, like many potentates, assumed all discoveries ranked as treasure and that what went to the museum in Cairo went only at his pleasure. Even early on, in February 1859, Mariette dashed to Thebes to confiscate a boatload of antiquities from the nearby tomb of Queen Ahhotep I that were to have been sent to the Khedive. In his position as Director of the Antiquities Service Mariette made concerted efforts to stifle the careers of Egyptians such as Ahmad Kamal within the Service. Heinrich Brugsch, a German philologist documented how Mariette was suspicious of Egyptians and forbade Egyptians from copying hieroglyphics in the Cairo Museum. Mariette was concerned, Brugsch states, that Egyptians might be appointed into official positions within the Museum and was dedicated to stopping that from occurring. In 1867, he returned to oversee the ancient Egyptian stand at the Exposition Universelle, to a hero's welcome for keeping France pre-eminent in Egyptology. In 1869, at the request of the Khedive, he wrote a brief plot for an opera. The following year this concept, worked into a scenario by Camille du Locle, was proposed to Giuseppe Verdi, who accepted it as a subject for Aida. For Aida, Mariette and Du Locle oversaw the scenery and costumes, which were inspired by the art of Ancient Egypt. The premiere of Aida was originally scheduled for February 1871, but was delayed until 24 December 1871, due to the siege of Paris at the height of the Franco-Prussian War (which trapped Mariette with the costumes and scenery in Paris). The opera met with great acclaim. Mariette was raised successively to the rank of bey and pasha, and European honors and orders were bestowed on him. In 1878, his museum was ravaged by floods, which destroyed most of his notes and drawings. By the spring of 1881, prematurely aged and nearly blind, Mariette arranged for the appointment of the Frenchman Gaston Maspero (a linguist rather than an archaeologist, who he had met at the Exposition in 1867), to ensure that France retained its supremacy in Egyptology in Egypt, rather than an Englishman. Death He died in Cairo and was interred in a sarcophagus which is on display in the Garden of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I (2002), by Donald Malcolm Reid, published by Dar El Kutub The bust of other famous Egyptologists, including Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, have been placed on a semi-circular memorial around the sarcophagus.

Thought to have a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate waters, the family contains just 18 species in two genera. The family name Chlorophthalmidae derives from the Greek words chloros meaning \\"green\\" and ophthalmos meaning \\"eye\\". Some species are of interest to commercial and subsistence fisheries; the fish are made into fish meal or sold fresh.  Description  Aptly named after their disproportionately large, iridescent (as well as fluorescent) eyes, greeneyes are slender fish with slightly compressed bodies. The largest species, the Shortnose greeneye (Chlorophthalmus agassizi) reaches a length of , but most other species are much smaller. Their heads are small with large jaws. Their coloration ranges from a yellowish to blackish brown, and some species have cryptic blotches. Their fins are simple and spineless; aside from their eyes, some species also have iridescent patches covering their heads.  Behaviour and reproduction  Greeneyes are generally deepwater fish, found from . They seem to prefer the continental slopes and shelves, possibly forming schools. Greeneyes are known to primarily feed on benthic invertebrates, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as decapods and mysids. Like many aulopiform fish, greeneyes are hermaphroditic; this is thought to be a great advantage in deep-sea habitats, where the chances of running into a compatible mate are uncertain. Young and larval greeneyes are pelagic rather than benthic, staying within the upper levels of the water column. Hake are known predators of greeneyes.

She became famous for her part in the Battle of the River Plate, the Battle of Crete, the Battle of Malta and as a supply escort in the Siege of Tobruk. This ship was the eighth in the Royal Navy to bear the name. In February 1942, she was adopted by the civil community of Halifax. Prewar and first actions Ajax was built at Vickers' shipyard, in Barrow- in-Furness, England. She was laid down on 7 February 1933, launched on 1 March 1934 and completed on 12 April 1935. She was commissioned for service on the North America and West Indies Station,Whitley, p.99 but after working up in May 1935, she was deployed instead to the Mediterranean on detached service after the Abyssinian crisis. This lasted until November when she finally joined her squadron in Bermuda. Until 1937 she undertook exercises and visits to ports in the Americas. At the end of her West Indies deployment, Ajax returned to Britain for refit. At this time, her 4\\" battery was upgraded by exchanging single for double mountings. She rejoined her squadron in the West Indies in February 1938 and remained on that station until 1939 when she was redeployed to the Pacific, off South America. On 27 January, Ajax went to assist the rescue of earthquake victims at Talcahuano, in Chile. She then returned to Bermuda and was redeployed to the South Atlantic Division in March. When war was declared in September 1939, Ajax took up her appropriate station and patrolled off the River Plate. There she sank the German merchant ship Olinda on 3 September. She intercepted the German merchantman Carl Fritzen and the passenger ship (with the cruiser ) on 4 and 5 September, respectively. Both ships were scuttled by their crews to avoid being taken as prizes.uboat.net After a brief deployment in and around the Falkland Islands, Ajax returned to her station off the Plate on 21 September.  The hunt for Admiral Graf Spee  HMS Achilles seen from Ajax during the Battle of the River Plate When the German raider, , became a threat, Force G was formed from Ajax (flagship, Commodore Henry Harwood), and , all cruisers.HMS Achilles was part of the Royal Navy's New Zealand Division. The Royal New Zealand Navy was formed in October 1941 and the ship's prefix then changed to \\"HMNZS\\". (Cumberland, also part of this force, was undergoing a refit at Port Stanley). Force G located and engaged Graf Spee on 13 December, despite the German warship's greater firepower. Ajax was hit seven times by the Germans: X and Y turrets were disabled, structural damage was sustained and there were 12 casualties including 7 killed.http://www.hmsajax.org/ajax-cruiser- casualties/4559492468 Exeter, more severely damaged, retired, leaving the two light cruisers to maintain contact with Graf Spee when she withdrew to Montevideo. The reasons for the German ship's withdrawal and her failure to exploit her advantage are unclear, but there was damage to her bows, that affected her sea-worthiness, and to her fuel systems. Ajax and Achilles, joined by Cumberland, awaited events and successfully bluffed the Germans into believing that a superior force was on hand. Graf Spee was scuttled by her own crew. Ajax refuelled at Port Stanley and resumed her patrol. In January 1940, she returned to Britain for refit, via Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and Freetown, Sierra Leone. She was joined en route by the aircraft carrier , the battlecruiser and the destroyers , , and . Ajax arrived at Plymouth at the end of January; the following month, she was handed over to Chatham Dockyard for refit.  Mediterranean, Crete and North Africa  Once refitted and worked up, Ajax became ready for service in August 1940. Her refit had included the addition of a Type 279 Radar,Howse, Radar at sea: The Royal Navy in World War 2, p64. a tripod mast and zarebas(\\"Zarebas\\" are breakwater-like structures on ships, intended to deflect sea-water off the deck and away from exposed installations), for the 4\\" batteries. In August 1940, Ajax was allocated to the 7th Cruiser Squadron for Mediterranean service (France had fallen and Italy was now a belligerent with a significant navy). She sailed from Britain on 21 August as part of the escort (with ), to a convoy for Egypt routed via the Mediterranean (Operation Hats), but she remained with a portion that was diverted via Durban. In late September, she escorted a troop convoy (, and ) from Aden to Suez. Ajax joined at Alexandria on 30 September. From 2 to 16 October, Ajax was engaged in major fleet manoeuvres to interdict Italian convoys to Libya and to protect British convoys to Malta. Firstly, she sailed with the fleetwhich included the battleships and , the aircraft carrier , the cruiser and eight destroyers. to search for Italian convoys, possibly with their own fleet escorts. On 8 October, Ajax again deployed with a major naval force The second deployment included battleships HMS , , Malaya and Ramillies, aircraft carriers and Eagle, cruisers York, Gloucester, , and HMAS Sydney with a screen of 16 fleet destroyers. to cover the passage to Malta of convoy MF3 (Operation MB6).Convoy MF3 consisted of four ships; Clan Ferguson, Clan Macauley, Lanarkshire and Mermon. Ajax and Orion patrolled south-east of Malta before covering the return of Convoy MF4 to Alexandria on 12 October. (The main fleet was deployed to the west of the convoy). During the night of 11‚Äì12 October, Ajax intercepted a small Italian force. In a close-range night action (sometimes called the Battle of Cape Passero), two s, Airone and Ariel, were sunk and the destroyer Artigliere was disabled (later sunk by HMS York).Sources differ on this action's details. Mason states that several British cruisers and destroyers, including Ajax, were engaged; Thomas states that, although Ajax was one of a cruiser cordon, she \\"sank two destroyers and damaged a third\\", without mentioning the involvement of the other British warships. Two more warships escaped into a smoke screen. Ajax herself was hit by seven shells that destroyed one of her whalers, caused severe damage to the bridge and radar installation and 35 casualties, including 13 killed. She returned to Alexandria on 16 October. At the end of October, Ajax set out on the first of two operations to carry troop reinforcements to Suda Bay, on Crete in Operation Barbarity; she suffered near misses from air attacks. On her return to the fleet on 6 November, she helped to provide cover for a Malta convoy, MW3. This was a large operation, involving most of the Mediterranean Fleet and part of a wider set of ship movements, Operation Coat. She was part of Force XCruisers HMS Orion, Ajax and HMAS Sydney, and destroyers and . which was detached from the main fleet on 11 November to sortie into the Straits of Otranto, between Italy and Albania, to provide a diversion and give cover for the successful naval air attack on Taranto. On 12 November, after turning to return to the main fleet, they intercepted a small convoy of four Italian merchant ships escorted by naval auxiliary and the obsolete torpedo-boat . Ramb III fired 19 salvos in its own defense and succeeded in breaking away without suffering any damage. Nicola Fabrizi stayed with the merchant ships and attacked the British forces. As a result, Nicola Fabrizi was hit immediately and suffered serious damage. The Italian torpedo boat continued to fight until it was unable to fight any more and retired badly damaged. After Nicola Fabrizi was neutralized, the British force divided up the targets and sank all four of the Italian merchant ships. This action took place near the Strait of Otranto (see Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1940)). Force X also bombarded the port of Durazzo (now Durres) and set the oil refinery on fire. before it rejoined the fleet. Ajax and other vessels were detached from the fleet and refuelled at Suda Bay before they returned to Alexandria. From 15 to 20 November, Ajax and four other cruisers HMS Gloucester, York, Orion and HMAS Sydney transported troops from Alexandria to Piraeus, the port of Athens, and returned to Alexandria. On 23 November, she was deployed with Force B Battleships HMS Malaya and Ramillies, aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, cruisers HMS Berwick, Orion, HMAS Sydney and destroyers to cover a convoy to Crete and to support air attacks on Tripoli from Eagle. Ajax bombards Bardia in Libya in December 1941 Ajax participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan and was hit by bombs from Ju 87s on 21 May 1941. She evacuated many troops from Crete up until 29 May.BBC Peoples War She then covered Syrian operations in June and joined Force K at Malta in November, being withdrawn in February 1942 for refit. Two years out of action (1942 & 1943) On 6 February she departed Suez for the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope, calling at Mombasa (9 March) and Freetown (9 April), arriving in the Clyde on 14 April. On 6 June, she was taken in hand for refit at Chatham Dockyard, which lasted until September. Her anti-aircraft (AA) gunnery was augmented by eleven Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Various radar sets were also installed; fire control radars for her main guns (Type 284), AA armament (Type 285) and barrage control (Type 283); an improved aircraft warning radar (the Type 281, replaced the Type 279), surface warning radar was also fitted, (the Type 272). Her aircraft facilities were removed. Ajax underwent post refit trials in October and after being recommissioned on 24 October, she worked-up at Scapa Flow with the Home Fleet during November. On 31 December, she joined Force Q at B√¥ne, in Algeria for the interdiction of enemy convoys and convoy defence. Ajax was disabled by a bomb‚Äîdropped by an aircraft from II./SKG 10 or II./StG 3‚Äî hitting \\"B\\" boiler room on 1 January 1943 while at B√¥ne, after convoy escort duty; she was towed on 7 January to Gibraltar for temporary repairs, which continued into February. Permanent repairs were arranged to take place in the United States and she was taken in hand at Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia; these lasted until September. During repair work, Ajax was equipped with US quadruple 40mm anti- aircraft mountings with provision for a British fire control radar Type 282, IFF Type 242 fitted and a US fire control radar replaced her existing Type 284. After post refit trials in October, she returned to Britain, via Bermuda, in November and the fitting of British equipment was completed. Ajax was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 25 December and joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow once more for work-up before returning to the Mediterranean in February 1944 after nearly two years out of action ‚Äì apart from just a couple of days in January 1943. Winston Churchill leaves Ajax to attend a conference in Athens, 28 December 1944. Captain Cuthbert: \\"I hope, Sir, that while you are with us we shan't have to open fire...if we are asked to give supporting fire I must do so.\\" Winston Churchill: \\"Pray remember, Captain, that I came here as a cooing dove of peace, bearing a sprig of mistletoe in my beak but far be it from me to stand in the way of military necessity.\\"The Churchill Centre: Winston Churchill on Ships and the Navy  D-Day and post war  As part of Force K, Ajax bombarded Gold Beach during the D-Day invasion; the battery at Longues gave some trouble but was silenced by 6-inch shells through the embrasures of two of the four casemates.Hyperwar She later supported the landings in southern France. Ajax also operated in the Aegean during the reoccupation of Athens and the communist uprising in Greece. After the war, Ajax was used to repatriate German sailors from the crew of Admiral Graf Spee from Uruguay back to Germany ‚Äì a historic irony since Ajax had been a member of the squadron that battled the German ship in 1939 and ultimately caused her to be scuttled. Ajax was then assigned to the Royal Navy Palestine Patrol and took part in the efforts to halt illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. In July 1947 it took part in the Exodus 1947 incident, in which she formed part of the Royal Navy task force which subdued the illegal immigrant ship and later escorted it back to Germany.  Final disposition  Ajax was decommissioned in February 1948. Sales to the Chilean Navy or Indian Navy were mooted, but this latter deal did not materialize due to Winston Churchill's apparent disapproval of the sale; he felt that such an important vessel would be better off broken up to preserve her history. After running aground at Newport, Monmouthshire, on 9 November 1949 while under tow to the scrapyard, she was refloated and duly arrived at Cashmore's, in Newport, South Wales, for breaking up on 18 November 1949.  Ajax remembered  The town of Ajax, in Ontario, Canada, was named after the cruiser following the Battle of the River Plate. The town also has streets named after every member of the ship's company, such as Hobson Avenue, and Harwood Avenue, which is the town's main north-south street. Many street signs in the town bear the silhouette of the ship. The silhouette signifies the street being named after part of the ship's company, and the ship's anchor rests in front of the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. Calle Exeter was named in honor of the ship, after HMS Exeter and HMS Ajax provided assistance to the citizens of Concepci√≥n, following the 1939 Chill√°n earthquake. Ajaxs bell is on a monument in Montevideo, just outside the port customs house, and was donated by Admiral Sir Henry Harwood and Sir Eugen Millington-Drake in 1949. Ajax Icefall at the head of Visca Anchorage, King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands is named for HMS Ajax, which assisted in the search for a boat crew from the Discovery II, missing on King George Island in January 1937.  In popular culture  The author Warren Tute's service on HMS Ajax during the 1930s formed the background for his novel The Cruiser. Like Ajax, the novel's fictional HMS Antigone was a Leander-class light cruiser which was based on the North America and West Indies Station before World War II and saw action in the Mediterranean. The novel paints a realistic picture of life on a cruiser.

He was a supporter of the great queen, Isabel I of Castile, and actively participated on her side in the civil war that broke out against her half-brother, Enrique IV, when the latter attempted to make his daughter, Juana, crown princess. Jorge died in 1479 during an attempt to take the castle of Garcimu√±oz, defended by the Marquis of Villena (a staunch enemy of Isabel), after Isabel gained the crown. Manrique was a great-nephew of I√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza (marquis of Santillana), a descendant of Pero L√≥pez de Ayala, chancellor of Castile, and a nephew of G√≥mez Manrique, corregidor of Toledo, all important poets of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He was, therefore, a member of a noble family of great literary consequence. The Minor Lyrics Jorge Manrique wrote love lyrics in the courtly-love tradition and two satires. These called canciones (songs), esparsas (short poems, generally of a single stanza), preguntas y respuestas (questions and answers), and glosas de mote (literally, \\"interpretations of refrains\\"; see villancico). The first edition of the Cancionero general of Hernando del Castillo (1511) has the most complete selection of Manrique's poems, but some of the lyrics appear in other early editions and manuscripts. Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre  First page of the Coplas by Jorge Manrique. Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre (English: \\"Stanzas about the Death of his Father\\") is Jorge Manrique's best composition. In fact, Lope de Vega pronounced it in humbled admiration to its superior craftmanship,\\"worthy to be printed in letters of gold\\". It is a funeral eulogy dedicated to the memory of Rodrigo Manrique (his father), who died on 11 November 1476 in Oca√±a. Jorge thought that his father led a life worth living. He makes a reference to three lives: > * the terrestrial life that ends in death * the life of the fame, that lasts > longer (Kleos Greek) * the eternal life after death, that has no end. Stanzas 1-24 talk about an excessive devotion to earthly life from a general point of view, but features some of the most memorable metaphors in the poem. Among other things, life is compared to a road filled with dangers and opportunities and to a river that ends in the sea: I Recuerde el alma dormida avive el seso e despierte contemplando c√≥mo se pasa la vida, c√≥mo se viene la muerte tan callando; cu√°n presto se va el placer, c√≥mo, despu√©s de acordado, da dolor; c√≥mo, a nuestro parecer, cualquiera tiempo pasado fue mejor. O let the soul her slumbers break, Let thought be quickened, and awake; Awake to see How soon this life is past and gone, And death comes softly stealing on, How silently! Swiftly our pleasures glide away, Our hearts recall the distant day the pain The moments that are speeding fast We heed not, but the past,‚Äîthe past, More highly prize. III Nuestras vidas son los r√≠os que van a dar en la mar, que es el morir. All√≠ van los se√±or√≠os derechos a se acabar e consumir. all√≠ los r√≠os caudales, all√≠ los otros medianos e m√°s chicos, allegados, son iguales los que viven por sus manos e los ricos. Our lives are rivers, gliding free To that unfathomed, boundless sea, The silent grave! Thither all earthly pomp and boast Roll, to be swallowed up and lost In one dark wave. Thither the mighty torrents stray, Thither the brook pursues its way, And tinkling rill, There all are equal; side by side The poor man and the son of pride Lie calm and still. The section invokes general examples of human waywardness that one may encounter along the road leading to heaven or hell, but then gives some examples of infamous deaths drawn from contemporary Spanish history. These examples are introduced by the rhetorical questions called ubi sunt (Where are they?) in stanzas 15-24: XVI ¬øQu√© se hizo el rey don Joan? Los infantes d'Arag√≥n ¬øqu√© se hizieron? ¬øQu√© fue de tanto gal√°n, qu√© de tanta invinci√≥n como truxeron? ¬øQue fueron sino devaneos, qu√© fueron sino verduras de las eras, las justas e los torneos, paramentos, bordaduras e √ßimeras? Where is the King, Don Juan? Where Each royal prince and noble heir of Aragon? Where are the courtly gallantries? The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done? Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye, And scarf, and gorgeous panoply, And nodding plume, What were they but a pageant scene? What but the garlands, gay and green, That deck the tomb? The last part of the poem is devoted to his father and talks about the life of fame and the possibility of continuing to live in the memories of the living, when one is great and has accomplished great deeds while living (stanzas 25-32). The poem ends with a small dramatic dialogue in which don Rodrigo confronts a personified Death, who deferentially takes his soul to Heaven (stanzas 33-39). A final stanza (40) gives consolation to the family. The language Manrique uses is precise, exact, without decoration or difficult metaphors. It appears to focus on the content of what is said and not on how it is said. The poem has forty stanzas, each composed of twelve eight- and four-syllable lines that rhyme ABc ABc DEf DEf. Every third line is a quebrado (half line). The verse form is now known as the copla manrique√±a (Manriquean stanza), because his poem was so widely read and glossed that he popularized the meter. Its alternation of long and short lines, and their punctuation, made the verses flexible enough to sound somber or light and quick. Coplas por la muerte de su padre has been translated at least twice, once by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The translations of stanzas I, III, and XVI provided above are by Longfellow. However, the Longfellow translation has been criticized as not being faithful to the original. Longellow's translation is considerably more florid than the original. For example, the famous lines \\"Nuestras vidas son los r√≠os/ que van a dar en la mar,/ que es el morir,\\" which reads in Longfellow as \\"Our lives are rivers, gliding free/ To that unfathomed, boundless sea,/ The silent grave!\\" literally translates as \\"Our lives are rivers/ That will lead to the sea/ Which is death.\\" References *Dom√≠nguez, Frank A.

R. R. Tolkien, posthumously published by his son Christopher Tolkien in Unfinished Tales (1980). This work explains how and why Gandalf arranged for the retaking of the Lonely Mountain (Erebor in Sindarin), an adventure recounted from the perspective of the eponymous Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, many years before, in Tolkien's The Hobbit. History \\"The Quest of Erebor\\" was originally written in the 1950s to be an appendix to The Lord of the Rings, but Tolkien decided not to include it due to space limitations, and only a very abridged version of the tale occurred in Appendix A, III \\"Durin's Folk\\". Though none of the original manuscripts were dated, it can be deduced that the story was written no earlier than September 29, 1953‚Äîthe date Tolkien first received page proofs for The Fellowship of the Ring. A note in the earliest known draft referenced a page number in Fellowship. There are multiple manuscripts extant of the work. The first published form of the story appeared in Unfinished Tales (1980), compiled by Tolkien's son Christopher. At the end of this version, Christopher included extracts from an earlier and longer manuscript, which was later published in its entirety in The Annotated Hobbit. The earliest known draft was later found and published in The Peoples of Middle-earth (1996) as part of the history of Appendix A's development. Synopsis \\"The Quest of Erebor\\" is written in the first person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins. However, nearly all the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story at Frodo's request in Minas Tirith after the coronation of King Elessar. Gandalf knew that Smaug the dragon could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was thinking about the matter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin too was concerned about Smaug, but had different motives: he wanted to reclaim the dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help Thorin, though he insisted that his party must make use of stealth rather than open confrontation; for that, they would need a burglar, to whom he would take them. Gandalf thought Bilbo to be a suitable companion to Thorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed that Bilbo took more of an interest in the world at large than was usual for hobbits, and was thus more likely to be adventurous. Another reason was that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a hobbit, advantageous to a stealthy operation and likely to distract the dragon's attention. Finally, Gandalf thought that putting a hobbit in the company would prevent Thorin, who did not think much of hobbits and doubted Bilbo's skills, from doing anything rash, such as openly confronting Smaug. Thorin objected to Bilbo's inclusion in the quest, and Gandalf had a difficult time convincing him. Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their adventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for his own reasons. After much debate, Gandalf managed to convince Thorin, aided by slight misunderstandings on Thorin's part which Gandalf was able to exploit, that Bilbo would be a worthy member. Additionally, Gandalf's show of loyalty to his friendship with the hobbit appealed to Thorin's sensibilities (as Dwarves respect loyalty to friends), leading him to be at least receptive to meeting the hobbit. The story serves several purposes for readers. Since The Hobbit is written almost entirely from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins and contains little that he does not directly experience or at least witness, \\"The Quest of Erebor\\" provides additional insight into the events during and preceding the story. It provides an explanation of why Gandalf wished to include Bilbo in Thorin's business, and why the Dwarves were willing to accept him. This assists in placing The Hobbit on a more equal footing with The Lord of the Rings; as The Hobbit is essentially a children's fantasy tale, the level of suspension of disbelief is already somewhat high and such matters do not require much explanation. The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, has a more serious tone, and so the additional information provided in \\"The Quest of Erebor\\" helps to explain the otherwise questionable motives of the characters in The Hobbit. Reception Christine Barkley, writing in Mythlore, notes that the point of view in The Quest of Erebor is Gandalf's, sharply contrasting with Bilbo's far less well- informed point of view in The Hobbit. That book, she states, uses a third- person, limited-knowledge narrator, supposedly written from Bilbo's diary after the adventure. Where Bilbo is interested in food and comfort, and sometimes other familiar things such as riddles, she writes, Gandalf is concerned with defending the West against the Shadow (Sauron). Further, the Quest actually pretends to be Frodo's memory of a conversation he had with Gandalf, rather than Gandalf actually writing, so there is uncertainty about how much of what Gandalf said may have been recorded. And when Frodo asks if he has now heard the full story, Gandalf replies \\"Of course not\\", so the narration is explicitly incomplete. From the reader's point of view, the point of the story is to explain how The Hobbit fits into the background of The Lord of the Rings, or more precisely, in Barkley's words, \\"why Bilbo was included in the dwarves' plans at Gandalf's suggestion.\\" Frank P. Riga and colleagues, also in Mythlore, write that Peter Jackson used the Quest to enrich the story when transforming The Hobbit from novel to film, along with Tolkien's 1960 partial version of The Hobbit which he had intended to make consistent with The Lord of the Rings. In their view, the Quest \\"closely and thoroughly connects the action of The Hobbit with the larger, cosmic concerns of the sequel, showing how the Dwarves' struggle to regain their homeland became crucial in frustrating Sauron's plan to attack Lorien and Rivendell.\\" They explain that the quest had to succeed or the actions described in The Lord of the Rings could not have occurred. Jackson made use of the connections, for instance, they state, making Saruman order Gandalf to stop the quest, and making Gandalf refuse, supported by Galadriel. Adaptations The Hobbit's 2013 film adaptation, The Desolation of Smaug, opens with the meeting between Gandalf and Thorin at The Prancing Pony. Elements of Gandalf's motivations and previous discussions with Thorin also find their way into An Unexpected Journey as dialogue, particularly in the meeting held in Bilbo's house.

In the Russian Empire, the term was the official title of the supreme military commanders of the Cossack armies. The Ukrainian version of the same word is Hetman. Otaman in Ukrainian Cossack forces was a position of a lower rank. Etymology The etymologies of the words ataman and hetman are disputed. There may be several independent Germanic and Turkic origins for seemingly cognate forms of the words, all referring to the same concept. The hetman form cognates with German Hauptmann ('captain', literally 'head-man') by the way of Czech or Polish, like several other titles. The Russian term ataman is probably connected to Old Russian vataman≈≠, and cognates with Turkic odoman (Ottoman Turks). The term ataman may had also a lingual interaction with Polish hetman and German hauptmann. The word is more probably of Turkic origin, literally meaning 'father of horsemen'. During certain periods, broadly corresponding with involvement with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the supreme leader of Ukrainian Cossacks was called the hetman. The ataman form is more commonly found in Russian periods, and exists in modern Russian, Turkish, and Tatar. Ivan Matveevich Krasnoshchekov, Ataman of the Don Cossacks. Portrait is from 1761. The term Ataman is a theme of various Russian folk songs () Otaman in Ukraine and Russia Otamans were usually elected by the Host Council or could have been appointed, especially during the military campaigns. The appointed otamans were called acting otaman (, ). In the Cossack Hetmanate, leaders of non-Cossack military units (artillery, etc.) were also called otamans. In the Cossack Hetmanate, the title was used for the administrative purposes, such as the head of the city, City Otaman (–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–∏–π –æ—Ç–∞–º–∞–Ω). Later such administrative uses were adopted by the Kuban Cossacks and were common in Kuban Oblast with different variations. There were various types of otaman: *Army otaman (), an executive officer in the Zaporizhian Host *Campaign otaman () *Kosh otaman () *Kurin otaman (), a commander of a ; *Sotenny otoman () and city otaman () were the 's lieutenants. Those titles were introduced during the Hetmanate in the 17th century. Together with the (, 'aide-de-camp') and (, 'flag-bearer'), this otoman helped the in administrative affairs. *Village otoman (), an administrative rank in the 17th to 18th centuries *Okrug otaman (), a territorial leader *Stanytsia otaman (), a territorial leader *Khutir otaman (), a territorial leader Otamans were also in charge of general- and regimental-size artillery units, as well as any volunteer military formations and the Zholdak cavalry.  20th century Atamans were the titles of supreme leaders of various Cossack armies during the Russian Civil War. When Ukraine acquired its independence in 1918, the rank took on different value. Among the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army, it was equivalent to a major, as is the battalion executive officer today. In the Ukrainian People's Republic, the title was of a general rank. Chief Otoman (–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏–π –æ—Ç–∞–º–∞–Ω) was the general of the Ukrainian Army who was assisted by his deputies, Acting Otomans. The head of the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in particular, Symon Petliura, was called Supreme Otaman (–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏–π –æ—Ç–∞–º–∞–Ω).

Ubertino of Casale (1259 ‚Äì c. 1329) was an Italian Franciscan and one of the leaders (together with Michael of Cesena) of the Spirituals, the stricter branch of the Franciscan order. Life Ubertino was born in Casale Monferrato. He assumed the Franciscan habit in a convent of the province of Genoa in 1273, and was sent to Paris to continue his studies, where he remained nine years, after which he returned to Italy. In 1285 he visited the sanctuaries of Rome, and thence proceeded to Greccio, near Rieti, to see John of Parma, who was considered as the patriarch of the Spiritual Friars. Afterwards he settled in Tuscany and in 1287, at Florence, where he comes under the influence of Pierre-Jean Olivi. He held a lectorship at Santa Croce, Florence, but abandoned it after a few years to dedicate himself to preaching, especially at Florence. Being a man of genius, but of an eccentric and restless character, he soon became the leader of the Spirituals in Tuscany.Golubovich, Girolamo. \\"Ubertino of Casale.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 31 December 2019 The Spirituals espoused poverty as obligatory and insisted on a stricter interpretation of the Rule of Saint Francis. They publicly criticized the government of the order and Popes Gregory IX and Nicholas III, who had favoured a moderate interpretation of the rule, and Pope Innocent III, who had disapproved of the teaching of Joachim of Fiore, as heretics. Therefore, Ubertino was summoned before Pope Benedict XI, forbidden to preach at Perugia, and banished to the convent of Monte Alverna. During his banishment, Ubertino wrote the Arbor Vitae Crucifixae Jesu Christi (The Tree of the Crucified Life of Jesus), exalting a literal interpretation of the Rule of St. Francis and the poverty of Christ. He mentions having met the mystic Angela of Foligno, who helped him resolve some unspecified inner difficulties.Murray OFM, Campion. \\"Poverty in The Tree of the Crucified Life of Jesus by Ubertino da Casale\\", Poverty and Devotion in Mendicant Cultures 1200-1450, (Constant J Mews, Anna Welch, eds.), London. Routledge. 2016, In the book, Ubertino identified Pope Boniface VIII, another opponent of the Spirituals, and Benedict XI as the first and second beast of the Apocalypse.Bernard McGinn, Antichrist: Two Thousand Years of the Human Fascination with Evil (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000), 164. The text circulated widely amongst the Canons Regular of the Windesheim Congregation, and was an important influence on John of Schoonhoven's De passione Domini.Mossman, Stephen. \\"Ubertino da Casale and the Devotio Moderna\\", Ons Geestelijk Erf, Volume 80, Issue 3, September 2009 pp. 199-280 Notwithstanding his views, Ubertino had many protectors and admirers. In 1307, he was chosen chaplain and familiar to cardinal Napoleone Orsini Frangipani, cardinal-protector of the Spirituals of the Marches of Ancona, but which protectorate soon ceased by the election of Boniface VIII in December 1294. In 1308, when Orsini went to Germany, Ubertino moved to France. In 1312-13, he was called to Avignon with other chiefs of the Spirituals to discuss before the pope the questions at issue between the two parties in the order.Burkitt, F. C. ‚ÄúUbertino da Casale and a Variant Reading‚Äù, The Journal of Theological Studies, vol. 23, no. 90, 1922, pp. 186‚Äì188. JSTOR During discussions, he attacked the moderate majority of his order and demanded separate convents and provinces for his party. But this was absolutely denied, whilst on the other hand the question of practical observance of poverty was settled by the famous Bull Exivi de paradiso, 6 May 1312, partly called forth by the polemical writings of Ubertino. Ubertino stayed with Cardinal Giacomo Colonna until 1317, when Pope John XXII allowed him to leave the Franciscan order and enter the Benedictine Abbey of Gembloux, in the Diocese of Li√®ge. Since Ubertino did not stop involving himself in the conflicts among Franciscans, he was excommunicated in 1318. In 1322, Ubertino was called back to Avignon by the Pope to give his opinion on a controversy between Dominicans and Franciscans concerning the poverty of Jesus Christ and the Apostles. Ubertino asserted that Christ and the Apostles, though they had rejected all property of private persons, made use of goods and money for necessities and alms as ministers of religion. This response was well received by Pope John XXII. Ubertino remained in Avignon, in the service of Cardinal Orsini, until 1325, when he was accused of heresy for having defended the condemned opinions of his teacher Peter Olivi. While the Pope commanded the general of the Franciscans to have him arrested as a heretic, Ubertino probably went to Germany to seek the protection of Louis the Bavarian, whom he is said to have accompanied on his way to Rome in 1328. Afterwards, Ubertino disappeared from the historical record. Some suppose that he left the Benedictines in 1332 to join the Carthusians, while the 15th century Fraticelli venerated him as saint and a martyr. Dante mentioned him in his Comedy,Paradiso, Canto XII, verses 121-126 as a supporter of stricter Franciscan rules.  References in popular culture  Ubertino appears as a minor, yet important character in Umberto Eco's historical novel The Name of the Rose (1980), and its film adaptation, where Ubertino is played by William Hickey.

Although World War II was officially over and baseball's finest players were back in their familiar ranks, tranquility no longer had a place in the majors. The new Mexican League, headed by millionaire Jorge Pasquel, had lured a cluster of bigleaguers. On January 2, 1946, the Chicago White Sox bought Carrasquel's contract from the Senators. He rejected the deal and fled to play in Mexico, signing a three-year contract ‚Äì the first shot in the cross-border disputes that would dominate baseball even more than the return of the war veterans. ‚ÄúPasquel paid me $3,000 cash [bonus], to sign a three- year contract calling for $10,000 a year,‚Äù Carrasquel said, in an interview three years later. ‚ÄúI took it, for in addition to the $33,000 I was to receive in Mexico, I also was free to pitch winter baseball‚Äù, he added, according to historian Lou Hernandez. There were several other players who fled to Mexico, including outfielder Danny Gardella, pitchers Sal Maglie and Max Lanier and catcher Mickey Owen. As a result, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler sought a lifetime suspension for them, but his penalty was later reduced. In 1949, Carrasquel returned to the majors and made three appearances for the White Sox before being farmed out. When Chicago acquired his nephew Chico Carrasquel in that season, GM Frank Lane swapped Alex to the Detroit Tigers for Cuban reliever Witto Aloma, who acted strictly as an interpreter for the young Venezuelan shortstop. Career statistics In an eight-season major league career, Carrasquel posted a 50‚Äì39 record with 252 strikeouts, a 3.73 ERA, 30 complete games, four shutouts, 16 saves, and 861 innings pitched in 258 games (64 as a starter). Carrasquel was married to Virginia Johnson. They had two sons, Thomas and William. He died in Caracas, Venezuela at the age of 57.

AV+ was devised by the 1998 Jenkins Commission which first proposed the idea as a system that could be used for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As the name suggests, AV+ is an Additional Member System which works in two parts: the 'AV' part and the 'plus' part. As in the alternative vote system, candidates are ranked numerically in order of preference. The important difference is that an additional group of members would be elected through regional party lists to ensure a degree of proportionality; in typical proposals, these members are 15‚Äì20% of the whole body. More specifically, each voter would get a second vote to elect a county or regional-level representative from a list of candidates of more than one person per party. The number of votes cast in this vote would decide how many representatives from that county or region would go on to parliament. In systems with an electoral threshold on regional seats, votes are transferred in order of voters' numerical preference until it puts a party above the threshold, or reaches a party already above.  Advantages  * Would require relatively minor modifications to existing system, and maintain single-member constituencies. * Would lead to a more proportional result than First Past the Post (FPTP) or AV, but would still give a built-in advantage to the largest party and allow one-party rule during landslide years. * Would lessen the problems of 'split voting' and the necessity of tactical voting. * Coalition governments, which include the opinions of multiple movements of the people, are more likely. * Decreases the chances of 'safe seats' and MPs holding seats for life. * MPs will have to secure 50% of votes to win a constituency seat - making them more accountable and working harder to win over a broader appeal. * Limits the chances for extremists to gain power scraping in with minority support. AV+ shuts down the ability for candidates to slip in with just a minority of the votes.  Criticisms  From FPTP (First Past The Post) supporters: * It is more complex than FPTP for voters * It is likely to lead to coalition government * It will lead to \\"two types of MP\\", as a majority would be linked directly to a constituency with a minority with a larger area overlapping the first group * It weakens the psychological link between voters and their representatives * It might cost more to count the votes From PR and STV (Single Transferable Vote) supporters: * It is not proportional enough * It is too likely to lead to one-party government * It will lead to \\"two types of MP\\" * The constituencies will still not be able to respect \\"natural boundaries\\" (although the top-up regions will) * It will not eliminate \\"safe seats\\" * The top-up vote aspect is too complex and either a simple AV system would be better or STV/AMS.  Reaction in the UK  Then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement, saying that the report \\"makes a well-argued and powerful case for the system it recommends\\" and that \\"it is very much a modification of the existing Westminster system, rather than any full blown PR system as practised in other countries.\\" He also praised Lord Jenkins for his work and gave the recommendations a cautious welcome, pointing out in particular that change would help address the \\"complete absence of Conservative representation in Scotland\\", a reference to the then most recent election in which the Conservatives failed to win a single seat in Scotland, despite winning 17.5% of the Scottish vote. However, leading figures in the Cabinet at the time (e.g. Home Secretary Jack Straw, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, Chancellor Gordon Brown and Margaret Beckett) and the Labour NEC, all strongly opposed reform of the voting system, and blocked the chance of change at that time. The report was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, although at the time the Liberal Democrats remained largely committed to STV, but preferred AV+ to First Past the Post. The report was heavily criticised by the Conservative party, with leader William Hague branding its proposals \\"a dog's breakfast\\". In a May 2009 article in The Times, Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for a referendum on the adoption of this system as part of the response to the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal. In this piece he praised the system as \\"an elegant solution\\". David Cameron, Leader of the Conservative Party, declared on May 26 that his party did not support the AV+ system, or any other form of proportional representation, as it would end up choosing a government \\"on the basis of secret backroom deals\\". In June 2009, it was reported by the BBC that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was considering changing the electoral system as part of a package of constitutional reform. In February 2010, the Labour government under Gordon Brown offered a Commons vote on a referendum for an alternative vote system, possibly manoeuvering for political positioning in case of a hung parliament following the general election on May 6. In a BBC interview on Election Night 2010, Home Secretary Alan Johnson suggested he would like to see the AV+ system introduced if a deal with the Liberal Democrats became necessary. A national referendum on the Alternative Vote system was granted as part of the Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, but not AV+. The Jenkins Commission rejected plain AV on the basis that it did little to relieve disproportionality, but favoured it over first-past-the-post as the basis for AV+.

He was a leading figure of the Counter-Reformation combat against the Protestant Reformation together with St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Philip Neri. In that role he was responsible for significant reforms in the Catholic Church, including the founding of seminaries for the education of priests. He is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church, with a feast day on November 4. Early life Charles was a descendant of nobility: the Borromeo family was one of the most ancient and wealthy in Lombardy, made famous by several notable men, both in the church and state. The family coat of arms included the Borromean rings, which are sometimes taken to symbolize the Holy Trinity. Charles' father Gilbert was Count of Arona. His mother Margaret was a member of the Milan branch of the House of Medici. The third son in a family of six children, he was born in the castle of Arona on Lake Maggiore 36 miles from Milan on 2 October 1538. Borromeo received the tonsure when he was about twelve years old. At this time his paternal uncle Giulio Cesare Borromeo turned over to him the income from the rich Benedictine abbey of Sts. Gratinian and Felin, one of the ancient perquisites of the family. Charles made plain to his father that all revenues from the abbey beyond what was required to prepare him for a career in the Church belonged to the poor and could not be applied to secular use. The young man attended the University of Pavia, where he applied himself to the study of civil and canon law. Due to a slight impediment of a speech he was regarded as slow but his thoroughness and industry meant that he made rapid progress. In 1554 his father died, and although he had an elder brother, Count Federico, he was requested by the family to take the management of their domestic affairs. After a time, he resumed his studies, and on 6 December 1559, he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law. Rome period On 25 December 1559 Borromeo's uncle Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Medici was elected as Pope Pius IV. The newly-elected pope required his nephew to come to Rome, and on 13 January 1560 appointed him protonotary apostolic. Shortly thereafter, on 31 January 1560, the pope created him cardinal, and thus Charles as cardinal-nephew was entrusted with both the public and the privy seal of the ecclesiastical state. He was also brought into the government of the Papal States and appointed a supervisor of the Franciscans, Carmelites and Knights of Malta. During his four years in Rome Borromeo lived in austerity, obliged the Roman Curia to wear black, and established an academy of learned persons, the Academy of the Vatican Knights, publishing their memoirs as the Noctes Vaticanae. Charles organized the third and last session of the Council of Trent, in 1562-63. He had a large share in the making of the Tridentine Catechism (Catechismus Romanus). In 1561, Borromeo founded and endowed a college at Pavia, today known as Almo Collegio Borromeo, which he dedicated to St. Justina of Padua. On 19 November 1562, his older brother, Federico, suddenly died. His family urged Charles to seek permission to return to the lay state (laicization), to marry and have children so that the family name would not become extinct, but he decided not to leave the ecclesiastic state. His brother's death, along with his contacts with the Jesuits and the Theatines and the example of bishops such as Bartholomew of Braga, were the causes of a conversion of Charles towards a more strict and operative Christian life, and his aim became to put into practice the dignity and duties of the bishop as drafted by the recent Council of Trent. Archbishop of Milan Charles was appointed an administrator of the Archdiocese of Milan on 7 February 1560. After his decision to put into practice the role of bishop, he decided to be ordained priest (4 September 1563) and on 7 December 1563 he was consecrated bishop in the Sistine Chapel by Cardinal Giovanni Serbelloni. Charles was formally appointed archbishop of Milan on 12 May 1564 after the former archbishop Ippolito II d'Este waived his claims on that archbishopric, but he was only allowed by the pope to leave Rome one year later. Charles made his formal entry into Milan as archbishop on 23 September 1565. Reform in Milan Rottmayr (Karlskirche, Vienna) After the death of his uncle, Pius IV (1566), Charles contributed materially to suppressing the cabals of the conclave. Before Charles went to Milan, while he was overseeing reform in Rome, a nobleman remarked that the latter city was no longer a place to enjoy oneself or to make a fortune. \\"Carlo Borromeo has undertaken to remake the city from top to bottom,\\" he said, predicting that the reformer's enthusiasm \\"would lead him to correct the rest of the world once he has finished with Rome.\\" Subsequently, he devoted himself to the reformation of his diocese which had deteriorated in practice owing to the 80-year absence of previous archbishops.\\"Saint Charles Borromeo\\", Catholic Online, accessed 14 Dec 2008 Milan was the largest archdiocese in Italy at the time, with more than 3,000 clergy and 800,000 people. Both its clergy and laity had drifted from church teaching. The selling of indulgences and ecclesiastical positions was prevalent; monasteries were \\"full of disorder\\"; many religious were \\"lazy, ignorant, and debauched\\".Swetnam, Susan H., \\"My Best Teachers Were Saints\\", Loyola Press Charles made numerous pastoral visits, and restored dignity to divine service. He urged churches to be designed in conformity with the decrees of the Council of Trent, which stated that sacred art and architecture lacking adequate scriptural foundation was in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art.Blunt, Anthony, Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450‚Äì1660, chapter VIII, especially pp. 107‚Äì128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), OUP, He divided the nave of the church into two compartments to separate the sexes at worship. He extended his reforms to the collegiate churches, monasteries and even to the Confraternities of Penitents, particularly that of St. John the Baptist. This group was to attend to prisoners and those condemned to death, to give them help and support. Charles Borromeo intercedes during the plague; painting by Jacob Jordaens (1655) Charles believed that abuses in the church arose from ignorant clergy. Among his most important actions, he established seminaries, colleges, and communities for the education of candidates for holy orders. His emphasis on Catholic learning greatly increased the preparation of men for the priesthood and benefited their congregations. In addition, he founded the fraternity of Oblates of St. Ambrose, a society of secular men who did not take orders, but devoted themselves to the church and followed a discipline of monastic prayers and study. They provided assistance to parishes where ordered by the church. The new archbishop's efforts for catechesis and the instruction of youth included the initiation of the first ‚ÄúSunday School‚Äù classes and the work of the Confraternity for Christian Doctrine. Borromeo diocesan reforms faced opposition from several religious orders, particularly that of the Humiliati (Brothers of Humility), a penitential order which, although reduced to about 170 members, owned some ninety monasteries. Some members of that society formed a conspiracy against his life, and a shot was fired at him in the archiepiscopal chapel. His survival was considered miraculous. In 1576 there was famine at Milan due to crop failures, and later an outbreak of the plague. The city's trade fell off, and along with it the people's source of income. The Governor and many members of the nobility fled the city, but the bishop remained, to organize the care of those affected and to minister to the dying. He called together the superiors of all the religious communities in the diocese and won their cooperation. Borromeo tried to feed 60,000 to 70,000 people daily. He used up his own funds and went into debt to provide food for the hungry. Finally, he wrote to the Governor, and successfully persuaded him to return. Influence on English affairs Charles had also been involved in English affairs when he assisted Pius IV. Many English Catholics had fled to Italy at this time because of the persecutions under Queen Elizabeth I. He gave pastoral attention to English Catholics who fled to Italy to escape the new laws against the Catholic faith. Saint Edmund Campion, a Jesuit, along with Saint Ralph Sherwin visited him at Milan in 1580 on their way to England. They stayed with him for eight days, talking with him every night after dinner. A Welshman, Griffith Roberts, served as his canon theologian, and an Englishman, Thomas Goldwell, as vicar-general. The archbishop carried on his person a small picture of John Fisher, who, with Thomas More, had been executed during the reign of Henry VIII, and for whom he held a great veneration. During the nineteenth-century Catholic restoration in England, Cardinal Wiseman was to institute an order of Oblates of St Charles, led by Henry Edward Manning, as a congregation of secular priests directly supporting the Archbishop of Westminster.Lytton Strachey, 1918, Eminent Victorians, Folio Society edition 1979 p. 69. Persecution of religious dissidents Painting by Francesco Caccianiga showing an angel tending to Charles Borromeo Though the Diet of Ilanz of 1524 and 1526 had proclaimed freedom of worship in the Republic of the Three Leagues, Charles repressed Protestantism in the Swiss valleys. The Catholic Encyclopedia relates: ‚ÄúIn November [1583] he began a visitation as Apostolic visitor of all the cantons of Switzerland and the Grisons, leaving the affairs of his diocese in the hands of Monsignor Owen Lewis, his vicar-general. He began in the Mesoleina Valley; here not only was their heresy to be fought, but also witchcraft and sorcery, and at Roveredo it was discovered that \\"the provost or rector, was the foremost in sorceries.‚Äù During his pastoral visit to the region, 150 people were arrested for practicing witchcraft. Eleven women and the provost were condemned to be burned alive. Reacting to the pressure of the Protestant Reformation, Borromeo encouraged Ludwig Pfyffer in his development of the Golden League, but did not live to see its formation in 1586. Based in Lucerne, the organization (also called the Borromean League) linked activities of several Swiss Catholic cantons of Switzerland, which became the center of Catholic Counter- Reformation efforts. This organization was determined to expel heretics and burned some people at the stake. It created severe strains in the civil administration of the confederation, and caused the break-up of Appenzell canton along religious lines. Controversy and last days Crypt of Charles Borromeo, in the alt=A coffin with glass sides allowing us to see the preserved body within, on a table inside an elaborately carved wooden nook, under a silver electric chandelier Borromeo was described by a biographer as ‚Äúan austere, dedicated, humorless and uncompromising personality‚Äù. Charged with implementing the reforms dictated by the Council of Trent, his uncompromising stance brought him into conflict with secular leaders, priests, and even the Pope. He met with much opposition to his reforms. The governor of the province and many of the senators addressed complaints to the courts of Rome and Madrid. In 1584, during his annual retreat at Monte Varallo, he fell ill with \\"intermittent fever and ague\\", and on returning to Milan grew rapidly worse. After receiving the Last Sacraments, he died quietly on 4 November at the age of 46. Veneration Following his death, popular devotion to Charles arose quickly and continued to grow. The Milanese celebrated his anniversary as though he were already a saint, and supporters in a number of cities collected documentation to support his canonization. In 1602 Clement VIII beatified Charles. In 1604 his case was sent on to the Congregation of Rites. On 1 November 1610, Paul V canonized Charles. Three years later, the church added his feast to the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 4 November. Along with Guarinus of Palestrina and perhaps Anselm of Lucca, he is one of only two or three cardinal-nephews to have been canonized. Charles Borromeo is the patron saint of bishops, catechists and seminarians. Iconography Borromeo's emblem is the Latin word humilitas (humility), which is a portion of the Borromeo shield. He is usually represented in art in his robes, barefoot, carrying the cross as archbishop, a rope around his neck, one hand raised in blessing, thus recalling his work during the plague. Sources Charles' biography was originally written by three of his contemporaries: Agostino Valerio (afterwards cardinal and Bishop of Verona) and Carlo Bascape (General of the Barnabites, afterwards Bishop of Novara), who wrote their contributions in Latin, and Pietro Giussanno (a priest), who wrote his in Italian. Father Giussanno's account was the most detailed of the three. Legacy Il Sancarlone (): colossal statue of Carlo Borromeo erected in Arona, Italy in 1697. The work of Giovanni Battista Crespi, the statue is 23 m tall and stands on a plinth 12 m in height. Borromeo's correspondence shows his influential position in Europe during his lifetime. The popes under whom he served sought his advice. The Catholic sovereigns of Europe ‚Äì Henry III of France, Philip II of Spain, Mary, Queen of Scots ‚Äì and others showed how they valued his influence. Cardinal Valerio of Verona said of him that Borromeo was \\"to the well-born a pattern of virtue, to his brother cardinals an example of true nobility.\\" Cardinal Baronius styled him \\"a second Ambrose, whose early death, lamented by all good men, inflicted great loss on the Church.\\" Late in the sixteenth or at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Catholics in England circulated among themselves a \\"Life of St. Charles\\".G.P.

Last (born October 18, 1929) is a physicist, silicon pioneer, and member of the so-called \\"traitorous eight\\" that founded Silicon Valley. Early life and education Last was born in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 18, 1929, at the beginning of the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and grew up during the Great Depression. His father was of German extraction, and his mother Scotch-Irish. Both of them were teachers, but his father left teaching to work in a steel mill in hopes of earning a better living. During the depression, there was no work in the steel mills, but the family managed by growing and preserving its own food. During World War II, his father worked six to seven days a week, 12 hours a day, under demanding and dangerous physical conditions. Jay Last enjoyed hiking, walking, and exploring while growing up. Between his junior and senior years of school, at age 16, he and a friend hitch-hiked to San Jose, California, and worked for the summer picking fruit. A voracious reader, he tended to complete his schoolwork well in advance of the rest of the class. He was encouraged by his chemistry teacher, Lucille Critchlow, who recommended him to work with Frank W. Preston, a local industrial chemist whose laboratory studied glass and glass fracture. Last began working at Preston's lab as a high-school student and continued to work for him as a university student, whenever he had a break. Last graduated from Butler Senior High School in 1947 and applied for a scholarship to study Optics at the University of Rochester. Last had heard about the program from his father and didn't apply anywhere else. It was a rigorous program, and three-quarters of the entering class had dropped out by the time the program was finished. The program had close ties to Eastman Kodak and to Bausch & Lomb: Last's class in optical design was taught by Rudolph Kingslake of Kodak. Last worked for a summer at the trouble-shooting department of Kodak's optical instrumentation plant, before his senior year of university. He tested a camera, to be used in the B52 aircraft, at -60 ¬∞F temperatures. He earned his bachelor's degree in Optics from the University of Rochester in 1951. He had become increasingly interested in physics, and was encouraged by an advisor, Parker Givens, to become involved in the emerging area of solid-state physics. After accepting an offer to study at MIT, he joined the laboratory of physicist Arthur R. von Hippel, and studied the physical structure of ferroelectric materials. He also took classes from John Clarke Slater and Victor F. Weisskopf. A material he was working with, barium titanate, underwent unusual structural changes when it became ferroelectric, requiring Last to study it using infrared spectroscopy. Last used a new instrument, a Beckman IR-3 spectrophotometer, and worked closely with staff from Beckman Instruments to report and fix problems. He earned his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1956. He was attracted by the west coast, which he had visited as a student. With possibilities of working at General Electric, at Bell Laboratories, and at Beckman Instruments, he was referred by Arnold Beckman to William Shockley. Shockley was starting up Shockley Semiconductor as a division of Beckman Instruments. Shockley flew out to MIT to recruit Last, and made a vivid impression. Regarding Shockley's arrival, Last has said, \\"I thought, my God, I've never met anybody this brilliant. I changed my whole career plans and said I want to go to California and work with this man.\\" Semiconductors  Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory Last worked at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments from April 1956 to September 1957. Shockley insisted on supervising each scientist individually, with little or no communication between group members. Last spent much of his time working on basic surface properties of materials, trying to explain anomalous results from four-layer silicon diodes. Last credits Shockley as being \\"an extraordinary, brilliant man.\\" \\"He made right decisions. He hired a good group of people... It was the right technology, the right material, the right group of people to implement it, and wham.\\" However, Shockley was not skilled at working with people, and his relationships with employees in the company deteriorated rapidly. In January 1957, a group of seven employees, including Last, appealed to Arnold Beckman to ask that he intervene in the company's operations. Beckman initially seemed sympathetic, but ended up supporting Shockley. The dissatisfied scientists included much of the core technical talent of the project: Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, and Robert Noyce. Initially looking for another company to join, they began to consider the possibility of creating their own company, with the support of Wall Street investors. They were eventually joined by C. Sheldon Roberts, and termed the \\"Traitorous Eight\\". They have also been called the \\"fathers of Silicon Valley\\".  Fairchild Semiconductor  On September 18, 1957, Last and the others formally resigned from Shockley Semiconductor to form Fairchild Semiconductor, as a division of Sherman Fairchild's Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. After they broke away, they were joined by another key Shockley employee, David Allison. Last has said of the new company's goals: At Fairchild Semiconductor Last worked as Head of Integrated Circuit Development and was instrumental in the creation of the first silicon circuit chips. Last emphasizes the collaborative nature of the new company and the cooperative nature of the group working together as equals. Fairchild's strategy for competing in the transistor market was to be fast and flexible. Rather than tying their research and development to lengthy 1-3 year military contracts, they financed development through Fairchild Camera. This enabled them to focus on promising ideas and develop them quickly. IBM was interested in obtaining transistors for a navigation computer for the B-70 bomber. Fairchild contracted to provide transistors to meet the specifications for IBM's core- memory driver. They developed complementary NPN and PNP transistors which could be used as a matched pair in a variety of circuit applications. Gordon Moore and David Allison worked on the NPN transistor, while Jean Hoerni developed the PNP transistor using boron diffusion. Scaling up to production of components in quantity presented major technological challenges, and Moore's NPN transistor was ready for production before Hoerni's PNP transistor. By August 1958, within 8 months of the company's creation, Fairchild was delivering Mesa transistors to IBM. Once it became available, the mesa transistor was desired for a wide variety of military applications. The speed with which it had been developed gave Fairchild a virtual monopoly on the fast-growing market for the next year. The most significant contract came from Autonetics, which was developing the navigation and control computer for the Minuteman ICBM. During this period, Last helped develop various transistor fabrication techniques in photo-lithography, photomasking, photoresists, and mesa etching. He helped to design a step-and-repeat camera to make photomasks and a method for aligning the masks. Many of the techniques developed at Fairchild became foundational to the creation of both transistors and integrated circuits by the semi-conductor industry. Integrated circuits In 1959, developing an idea he had noted as early as 1957, Jean Hoerni submitted two patent applications describing his \\"Planar process\\". He presented a novel adaptation of silicon manufacturing processes that had originated at Bell Labs. The planar process created a flat surface structure protected with an insulating silicon dioxide layer. Robert Noyce showed how Hoerni‚Äôs planar process could be exploited to electrically interconnect the components of an integrated circuit. On February 12, 1960, Jay T. Last, Robert Norman, and Isy Haas reported on the first integrated circuits at the IRE Solid State Conference in a paper entitled Solid-State Micrologic Elements. They described hybrid silicon integrated circuits that they had developed, including a flip-flop, a gate, an adder, and a shift register. They also discussed the feasibility of creating miniaturized, integrated logic circuits. However, they still faced many challenges in improving and commercially producing them. By the summer of 1960, Jay Last's Fairchild Semiconductor team succeeded in building and demonstrating the first working planar integrated circuits. The working group included Jay Last, Bob Norman, Isy Haas, Lionel Kattner, James Nall, James Wilkerson, Gary Tripp, Robert Marlin, Chester Gunter, Jerry Lessard, and Melvin Hoar. As of September 1960, Last's Micrologic section was pursuing three possible approaches for creating micro- circuitry: Phase I (hybrid circuits), Phase II (physically isolated integrated circuits) and Phase III (diffusion or electrically isolated integrated circuits). The electrically isolated circuits were initially a side project of Hass and Kattner, who worked on the idea in their own time. In September 1960 they reported an important breakthrough. Last believed that their work held great promise. However, outside Last's working group, there was considerable resistance to the integrated circuits project at Fairchild. Fairchild's marketing VP, Tom Bay, recommended shutting the project down entirely. Fairchild was focused more on the production of diodes and transistors and did not immediately see applications for integrated circuits. As a result, Jay Last chose to leave Fairchild. Lionel Kattner took over the Fairchild transistor project and eventually, with the approval of Gordon Moore, put a family of transistors into production by the end of 1961.  Amelco and Teledyne  Once again, Last was in the position of resigning from one company so that he could develop new technology in another company. The excitement of discovering and developing something new in an entrepreurial setting appealed to Last much more than iterative development and production of known technology. On January 31, 1961, Jay Last, Jean Hoerni, Sheldon Roberts, and (briefly) Gene Kleiner of the \\"traitorous eight\\" resigned from Fairchild Semiconductor to create Amelco Corporation as a division of Teledyne. They were later joined by Isy Haas. Henry Earl Singleton and George Kozmetsky formed Teledyne (originally named Instrument Systems) by acquiring smaller companies, with the intention of positioning themselves to create integrated circuits for advanced military systems. Last and Hoerni had technical expertise essential to such an undertaking. By targeting specialty military applications as their primary market, Teledyne avoided putting itself in direct competition with Fairchild, and stayed on generally good terms with the larger company. From 1961 to 1966 Last served as Director of Research and Development at Amelco. The manufacturing operation, Electron Devices, was established as a subsidiary of Amelco, in Mountain View, California. Last insisted on staying in the area that became Silicon Valley, because it was developing the necessary infrastructure for obtaining materials, equipment and personnel. Again, in choosing to stay in California, Last was a pioneer in creating Silicon Valley. Many of the products that Teledyne created were classified products for specific military uses, of which little was publicly known. They created circuits used by NASA and military space operations, including products used in the Doppler system for moon landings. From 1966 to 1974 Last served as Vice President of Research and Development for Teledyne, moving to Los Angeles, California to work more closely with George Roberts. His role became one of higher level oversight and trouble-shooting, reviewing the technological capabilities and viability of various companies within Teledyne.  Recognition  In May 2011, the traitorous eight (Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and C. Sheldon Roberts) received the ‚ÄúLegends of California Award‚Äù from the California Historical Society. Prior to the award ceremony, Last said he was not scared about his risky departure from Shockley, explaining, \\"When you are in your late 20s you don‚Äôt know enough to be scared, we just did it. We just knew what we had to do and we did it.\\"Poletti, Therese, \\"‚ÄòTraitorous Eight‚Äô feted as California icons\\", MarketWatch Retrieved May 10, 2011. Last appeared on the PBS documentary series American Experience in the episode titled \\"Silicon Valley\\", which debuted on February 6, 2013. The show focused on the eight pioneering innovators, including Last, who defected from Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to start Fairchild Semiconductor, and turned Santa Clara County, California, into the center of technological ingenuity. In the program, Last reflected on how, at age 16, between his junior and senior years of high school, he hitchhiked to California and spent the summer picking apricots in Santa Clara Valley. Last also talked about the day that William Shockley showed up in Last's laboratory at MIT and offered him a job at his company. Art and philanthropy The brightly colored fruit-box labels used in southern California interested Last in color lithography.

He created the games Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy for the ZX Spectrum, released in 1983 and 1984 respectively. Smith left the games industry in 1988 and later moved to the Netherlands. He has since returned to the UK and has worked on some games as well as appearing at conventions and in documentaries. Early life Matthew was born in Penge. His family moved to Wallasey when he was seven years old. Programming career 1980s He started out programming when he received a TRS-80 for Christmas in 1979. His first commercial game was a Galaxian clone for the TRS-80 called Delta Tower One. He then went on to produce Monster Muncher on the VIC-20. Smith has said that he wrote Monster Muncher in 3 hours.http://pixelatron.com/blog/matthew-manic-miner-smith- complete-transcript-of-2005-interview/ He obtained a ZX Spectrum on loan from Bug-Byte Software Ltd. in return for a freelance contract for three games. The first of these was Styx in 1983 for which Matthew received ¬£3,000. He wrote Manic Miner in eight weeks using a Model III Tandy. It was the first ZX Spectrum title with in-game music.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-07-26-manic-miner-360-revisiting- a-classic The sequel, Jet Set Willy, took considerably longer to write.http://www.carlylesmith.karoo.net/spectrum/matsmith/mattpcw.html Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy were both commercial successes. Smith has stated that Manic Miner was the most enjoyable game to make for him whereas Jet Set Willy was 'seven shades of hell'. After the creation of Jet Set Willy he started work on The Mega Tree (commonly known as Willy Meets The Taxman), for publication by his company Software Projects. Unlike his previous two hits The Mega Tree was not developed for the ZX Spectrum but the Commodore 64. The project failed to gain traction and was cancelled three months into development.. The development disks containing some of the graphics from the unreleased game were eventually auctioned for charity in 2004. In 1987 adverts began appearing in games magazines for a new game Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars said to have been programmed by Smith, and due for release by Software Projects. It is reported that Smith was unhappy with the finished product and it was never released. Departure Smith closed Software Projects in 1988 without completing any more programs. He lived in a Dutch commune from around 1995 but was deported from the Netherlands in October 1997 and returned to Britain, saying that he had failed to keep his residency papers in order. In the late 1990s, he said he was \\"surprised and flattered\\" at the amount of attention and speculation he had attracted on the Internet. Return to games In 1999 Smith returned to the UK video game industry by taking a job at Dewsbury-based computer game developer Runecraft. In 2000, he appeared on a British television documentary programme called Thumb Candy about the history of video games in which, in a brief interview, he discussed Manic Miner and his 1980s career. He has also attended and given talks at retrogaming conventions during this decade. In 2005, a mobile game was released by Numfum, called Jet Set Racing. Smith was featured in the game as a playable character as 'Matt', being the fastest racer of the game. In 2013, Smith was working on producing a new game with Elite Systems, who have republished his original games on mobile platforms.

It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, which hosts the main Poplog website. There is now also a Github Poplog] site with the core source files. POP-11 is an evolution of the language POP-2, developed in Edinburgh University, and features an open stack model (like Forth, among others). It is mainly procedural, but supports declarative language constructs, including a pattern matcher, and is mostly used for research and teaching in artificial intelligence, although it has features sufficient for many other classes of problems. It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11's features is that it supports first-class functions. POP-11 is the core language of the Poplog system. The availability of the compiler and compiler subroutines at run-time (a requirement for incremental compilation) gives it the ability to support a far wider range of extensions (including run-time extensions, such as adding new data-types) than would be possible using only a macro facility. This made it possible for (optional) incremental compilers to be added for Prolog, Common Lisp and Standard ML, which could be added as required to support either mixed language development or development in the second language without using any POP-11 constructs. This made it possible for Poplog to be used by teachers, researchers, and developers who were interested in only one of the languages. The most successful product developed in POP-11 was the Clementine Data-mining system, developed by ISL. After SPSS bought ISL they decided to port Clementine to C++ and Java, and eventually succeeded with great effort (and perhaps some loss of the flexibility provided by the use of an AI language). POP-11 was for a time available only as part of an expensive commercial package (Poplog), but since about 1999 it has been freely available as part of the Open Source version of Poplog, including various additional packages and teaching libraries. An online version of ELIZA using POP-11 is available at Birmingham. At the University of Sussex, David Young used POP-11 in combination with C and Fortran to develop a suite of teaching and interactive development tools for image processing and vision, and has made them available in the Popvision extension to Poplog. Simple code examples Here is an example of a simple POP-11 program: define Double(Source) -> Result; Source*2 -> Result; enddefine; Double(123) => That prints out:  246 This one includes some list processing: define RemoveElementsMatching(Element, Source) -> Result; lvars Index; % for Index in Source do unless Index = Element or Index matches Element then Index; endunless; endfor; % -> Result; enddefine; RemoveElementsMatching(\\"the\\", the cat sat on the mat) => ;;; outputs cat sat on mat RemoveElementsMatching(\\"the\\", the cat] [sat on] the mat]) => ;;; outputs the cat] [sat on] mat] RemoveElementsMatching(= cat, the cat is a big cat) => ;;; outputs is a Examples using the POP-11 pattern matcher, which makes it relatively easy for students to learn to develop sophisticated list-processing programs without having to treat patterns as tree structures accessed by 'head' and 'tail' functions (CAR and CDR in Lisp), can be found in the online introductory tutorial. The matcher is at the heart of the SimAgent (sim_agent) toolkit. Some of the powerful features of the toolkit, such as linking pattern variables to inline code variables, would have been very difficult to implement without the incremental compiler facilities.

Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bol√≠var and other patriot leaders, such as Santiago Mari√±o, Manuel Piar, Jos√© Francisco Berm√∫dez and Francisco de Paula Santander often had to go into exile in the Caribbean or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former Spanish colonies, the currently existing Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, and the now defunct Gran Colombia. In his 21-year career, Bol√≠var faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the First Venezuelan Republic and in New Granada convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed Spanish American royalists to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the Spanish Monarchy on the continent. Historical background Miniature portrait of Bol√≠var at about age 21 made in Paris, circa 1804. The idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans Manuel Gual and Jos√© Mar√≠a Espa√±a, inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to establish a republic in Venezuela with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan expatriate Francisco de Miranda led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and Espa√±a's conspiracy, Miranda's putsch failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda's invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan Criollos is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the Spanish Crown: they wanted an expansion of the free trade that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown's new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (espa√±oles) to Pardos through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (gracias al sacar). So the Criollos' failure to support Gual, Espa√±a and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them. In neighboring New Granada tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the Revolt of the Comuneros pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the Bourbon Reforms. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like Antonio Nari√±o, became intrigued by the ideas of the French Revolution and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy. The break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by Napoleon's removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced Ferdinand VII to abdicate, and his father Charles IV to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his invasion of Spain. As the entire Spanish world rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the King of Naples and Sicily), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized provisional government (the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year Siege of C√°diz. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and Bogot√°, just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.Lynch, Bol√≠var: A Life, 44-48; Madariaga, 108-116; and Masur (1969), 62-65. Service under the First Republic (1810-1812) In 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bol√≠var had retreated to his estate in the Valleys of Aragua, refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bol√≠var did return in December 1810 with Francisco de Miranda, who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela. Independence declared Civil war broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain (the Cortes of C√°diz), that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, declared independence on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in Valencia in favor of the Cortes of C√°diz. Bol√≠var's first military service was as an officer under Miranda's command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bol√≠var was promoted to colonel and made commandant of Puerto Cabello the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bol√≠var lost control of San Felipe Castle along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bol√≠var effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in San Mateo. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.Masur (1969), 98-102; and Lynch, Bol√≠var: A Life, 60-63. The royalist restoration The terms of the Capitulation of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of La Guaira, Colonel Manuel Mar√≠a Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bol√≠var, Miguel Pe√±a and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for treason to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bol√≠var a passport, and Bol√≠var left for Cura√ßao on August 27. Exile and the Second Republic (1812-1814) In Cura√ßao Bol√≠var learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were confiscated to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bol√≠var decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to Cartagena de Indias, which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogot√° to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the United Provinces of New Granada. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bol√≠var began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his Cartagena Manifesto. In the document Bol√≠var blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde's advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the Magdalena Campaign against cities in the lower Magdalena River that had refused to accept Cartagena's authority or that of the Union, and then attacked Oca√±a. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his Admirable Campaign. His reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde's troops had already carried out atrocities: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bol√≠var also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and Peninsulares, Bol√≠var's instituted a policy of no quarter in his Decree of War to the Death, in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any American even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.Lynch, Bol√≠var: A Life, 70-75; and Masur (1969), 122-127. The Republic restored and lost Portrait of Bol√≠var made in Haiti in 1816. Bol√≠var's push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since Santiago Mari√±o had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bol√≠var's forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered Caracas on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bol√≠var announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a military government, since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bol√≠var would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and commander-in-chief of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mari√±o, based in Cuman√°, did not recognize Bol√≠var's claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against Peninsular royalists that were captured. It was during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of M√©rida, granted Bol√≠var the title of Liberator and office of captain general in the Church of San Francisco (the more appropriate site, the Cathedral of Caracas, was still damaged from the 1812 earthquake). Bol√≠var and Mari√±o's success, like Monteverde's a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower- class people, especially the southern, rural llaneros (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. Llaneros played a key military role in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol√≠var out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General Juan Manuel Cajigal was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of llaneros recruited and led by Jos√© Tom√°s Boves. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bol√≠var had demonstrated in his \\"war to the death\\" decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of La Puerta on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves's llanero hoards, had to flee en masse to Mari√±o's strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mari√±o's and Bol√≠var were defeated again at Aragua de Barcelona on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bol√≠var and Mari√±o were arrested and removed from power by Jos√© F√©lix Ribas and Manuel Piar, each representing the two republican commands then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bol√≠var and Mari√±o set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans. Royalist control consolidated Earlier in March 1814, Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne. The Sixth Coalition's advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel Pablo Morillo, a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for Montevideo in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for Margarita Island, which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of Santa Marta, which had remained in royalist hands since 1810. Second exile in New Granada and the Caribbean (1814-1816) Like many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bol√≠var once again entered into the service of the United Provinces and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogot√° on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month- long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bol√≠var left for Jamaica on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogot√° in May of the following year.

Now thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bol√≠var once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous Letter from Jamaica, though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of Haiti, that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bol√≠var and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president Alexandre P√©tion. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over P√©tion and a Cura√ßaoan sea merchant, Luis Bri√≥n (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. P√©tion, for his part, convinced Bol√≠var to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves. The √©migr√©s successfully captured a beachhead at Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bol√≠var proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two decrees of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo's forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of Mari√±o, Piar and Carlos Soublette the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bol√≠var led an assault against Ocumare de la Costa, which ended in a debacle in which Bol√≠var abandoned Mari√±o, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar's forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern Llanos, where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under Jos√© Antonio P√°ez protected them from the royalist army. Mari√±o retreated to his home province of Cuman√°, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bol√≠var returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bol√≠var the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed. In Haiti Bol√≠var gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in Barcelona controlled by Mari√±o, who by this point barely accepted Bol√≠var as head of the republicans. The Third Republic (1817-1820) First issue of the Correo del Orinoco, June 27, 1818. Bol√≠var took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of Angostura, and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bol√≠var's reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817.Lynch, The Spanish American Revolutions, 210-211. Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river's tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in Casanare, where refugees from Morillo's troops had organized themselves under Francisco de Paula Santander. In Angostura Bol√≠var began publishing the Correo del Orinoco newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under P√°ez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local llaneros who, after Morillo disbanded Boves's informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the llanero's energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his Pardo roots as he built a Pardo and llanero following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bol√≠var, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic. Challenges to Bol√≠var's authority The first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the \\"Congresillo of Cariaco\\" on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of Canon Jos√© Cort√©s de Madariaga‚Äîwho had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain‚ÄîLuis Bri√≥n and Santiago Mari√±o. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by other nations. Mari√±o offered his and Bol√≠var's resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the triumvirate and selected Fernando Rodr√≠guez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in Trinidad), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cort√©s de Madariaga. It made Mari√±o general- in-chief of the republican forces and established La Asunci√≥n as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bol√≠var to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, who remained loyal to Bol√≠var, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bol√≠var, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to \\"cassava bread in hot soup\\" and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.Jos√© Luis Salcedo-Bastardo, \\"Congreso de Cariaco\\" in Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela, Vol. 1. Caracas: Fundaci√≥n Polar, 1999. It was clear to Bol√≠var by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bol√≠var's leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bol√≠var, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bol√≠var changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a pardocracia) in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, court-martialed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar's crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bol√≠var authority. After Piar's execution, Mari√±o, whom Bol√≠var's confidant and chronicler Daniel Florencio O'Leary later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.Lynch, The Spanish American Revolutions, 210-213. His political position secured, Bol√≠var began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with P√°ez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bol√≠var as head of the republicans. P√°ez, however, refused to take his powerful llanero cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo's formal army. Bol√≠var was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bol√≠var felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The Congress of Angostura, consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bol√≠var's \\"Address at the Congress of Angostura\\", now seen along with his \\"Cartagena Manifesto\\" and \\"Jamaica Letter\\" as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bol√≠var president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies. The New Granada Campaign After the opening of the Congress, Bol√≠var conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bol√≠var decided to move during the Venezuelan invierno, the rainy season, when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bol√≠var's troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, malarial water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, P√°ez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the Apure and Meta River regions, Bol√≠var set off in June 1819. Bol√≠var's troops cross the Cordillera Oriental The small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a British legion. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the P√°ramo de Pisba, at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the Cordillera Oriental. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly llanero army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bol√≠var was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bol√≠var's small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of Francisco Mari√±o y Soler the republican army cleared its way to Bogot√°. First at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on July 25, Bol√≠var intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the Battle of Boyac√° on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bol√≠var. On receiving the news, the viceroy, Juan Jos√© de S√°mano, and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bol√≠var and Santander. On August 10 Bol√≠var's army entered Bogot√°. With New Granada secure under Santander's control, Bol√≠var could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bol√≠var's success. By year's end Bol√≠var presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, Colombia. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years. President and Commander-in-Chief of Gran Colombia (1820-1825) Monument to the meeting between Morillo and Bol√≠var in Santa Ana de Trujillo. 1820 proved to be a banner year for Bol√≠var. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the Riego Revolt. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo's expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the C√°diz Constitution arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bol√≠var's stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.Earle, Rebecca A. Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 1810-1825. Exeter, University of Exeter Press, 2000, 153. Despite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a ceasefire and bringing the war in line with the law of nations. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in Santa Ana de Trujillo, which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the rules of engagement. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of \\"Bol√≠var's forces\\" or \\"the Congress at Angostura.\\"Earle, Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 154-159. The ceasefire allowed Bol√≠var to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by Miguel de la Torre. Victory in Venezuela The truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the cabildo of Maracaibo, which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son Rafael Urdaneta, declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bol√≠var returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito. The Southern Campaign, Quito and Peru (1821-1824) Allegory of Bol√≠var's liberation of Colombia in a book of poetry by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo. With the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the Presidency of Quito began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in Guayaquil set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. Portoviejo and Cuenca followed suit in the next few weeks. Quito remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal Melchior Aymerich, and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bol√≠var was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio Jos√© de Sucre began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From Puerto Cabello royalist make a counterattack at Battle of Lake Maracaibo. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bol√≠var and San Mart√≠n held a meeting in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bol√≠var and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart√≠n departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bol√≠var was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bol√≠var the head of state of a second country and allowed Bol√≠var to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bol√≠var, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the Battle of Jun√≠n. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at Battle of Ayacucho on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of Upper Peru, El Callao and Chilo√©. The Peruvian and Colombian campaign in Upper Peru For details, see Bolivian War of Independence Bol√≠var was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bol√≠var was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and O'Connor, and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bol√≠var. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bol√≠var's political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government. The dissolution of Gran Colombia and aftermath Sketch of Bol√≠var at age 47 made from life by Jos√© Mar√≠a Espinosa in 1830. During 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bol√≠var called for a constitutional convention at Oca√±a to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bol√≠var proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bol√≠var politically. The Convention of Oca√±a (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bol√≠var had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bol√≠var delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified. After the failure of the convention, Bol√≠var proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an Organic Decree of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bol√≠var failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bol√≠var emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bol√≠var himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830. Bol√≠var's legacy continued in the successor states to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bol√≠var's political thought‚Äîhis emphasis on a strong, centralized government‚Äîbecame the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.

An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid. An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments. Common antifreezes increase the boiling point of the liquid, allowing higher coolant temperature. Because water has good properties as a coolant, water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the additive (pure concentrate) and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers. Secondarily but not less importantly, most if not all commercial antifreeze formulations intended for use in heat transfer applications include different kinds of anti-corrosion and anti-cavitation agents that preserve the entire hydraulic circuit from progressive wear. Principles and history Water was the original coolant for internal combustion engines. It is cheap, nontoxic, and has a high heat capacity. It however has only a 100 ¬∞C liquid range, and it expands upon freezing. These problems are addressed by the development of alternative coolants with improved properties. Freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution, which depend on the concentration of dissolved substances. Hence salts lower the melting points of aqueous solutions. Salts are frequently used for de-icing, but salt solutions are not used for cooling systems because they induce corrosion of metals. Low molecular weight organic compounds tend to have melting points lower than water, which recommends them as antifreeze agents. Solutions of organic compounds, especially alcohols, in water are effective. Alcohols - ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, etc. - have been the basis of all antifreezes since they were commercialized in the 1920s. Use and occurrence Automotive and internal combustion engine use Fluorescent green-dyed antifreeze is visible in the radiator header tank when car radiator cap is removed Most automotive engines are \\"water\\"-cooled to remove waste heat, although the \\"water\\" is actually antifreeze/water mixture and not plain water. The term engine coolant is widely used in the automotive industry, which covers its primary function of convective heat transfer for internal combustion engines. When used in an automotive context, corrosion inhibitors are added to help protect vehicles' radiators, which often contain a range of electrochemically incompatible metals (aluminum, cast iron, copper, brass, solder, et cetera). Water pump seal lubricant is also added. Antifreeze was developed to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid. On the other hand, if the engine coolant gets too hot, it might boil while inside the engine, causing voids (pockets of steam), leading to localized hot spots and the catastrophic failure of the engine. If plain water were to be used as an engine coolant, it would promote galvanic corrosion. Proper engine coolant and a pressurized coolant system obviate these shortcomings of water. With proper antifreeze, a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the engine coolant, such as to for 50% (by volume) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system.Prestone Press ReleasePeak Antifreeze chart Early engine coolant antifreeze was methanol (methyl alcohol). Ethylene glycol was developed because its higher boiling point was more compatible with heating systems. Other industrial uses The most common water-based antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures of water and either ethylene glycol (EGW) or propylene glycol (PGW). The use of ethylene glycol has a longer history, especially in the automotive industry. However, EGW solutions formulated for the automotive industry often have silicate based rust inhibitors that can coat and/or clog heat exchanger surfaces. Ethylene glycol is listed as a toxic chemical requiring care in handling and disposal. Ethylene glycol has desirable thermal properties, including a high boiling point, low freezing point, stability over a wide range of temperatures, and high specific heat and thermal conductivity. It also has a low viscosity and, therefore, reduced pumping requirements. Although EGW has more desirable physical properties than PGW, the latter coolant is used in applications where toxicity might be a concern. PGW is generally recognized as safe for use in food or food processing applications, and can also be used in enclosed spaces. Similar mixtures are commonly used in HVAC and industrial heating or cooling systems as a high-capacity heat transfer medium. Many formulations have corrosion inhibitors, and it is expected that these chemicals will be replenished (manually or under automatic control) to keep expensive piping and equipment from corroding. Biological antifreezes Antifreeze proteins refer to chemical compounds produced by certain animals, plants, and other organisms that prevent the formation of ice. In this way, these compounds allow their host organism to operate at temperatures well below the freezing point of water. Antifreeze proteins bind to small ice crystals to inhibit growth and recrystallization of ice that would otherwise be fatal. Primary agents Ethylene glycol Ethylene glycol Most antifreeze is made by mixing distilled water with additives and a base product ‚Äì MEG (Mono ethylene glycol) or MPG (Mono propylene glycol). Ethylene glycol solutions became available in 1926 and were marketed as \\"permanent antifreeze\\" since the higher boiling points provided advantages for summertime use as well as during cold weather. They are used today for a variety of applications, including automobiles, but there are lower-toxicity alternatives made with propylene glycol available. When ethylene glycol is used in a system, it may become oxidized to five organic acids (formic, oxalic, glycolic, glyoxalic and acetic acid). Inhibited ethylene glycol antifreeze mixes are available, with additives that buffer the pH and reserve alkalinity of the solution to prevent oxidation of ethylene glycol and formation of these acids. Nitrites, silicates, borates and azoles may also be used to prevent corrosive attack on metal. Ethylene glycol has a bitter, sweet taste and causes inebriation. The toxic effects of ingesting ethylene glycol occur because it is converted by the liver into 4 other chemicals that are much more toxic. The lethal dose of pure ethylene glycol is 1.4 ml/kg ( is lethal to a person) but is much less lethal if treated within an hour.PM Leth, M Gregersen. Ethylene glycol poisoning. Forensic science international, 2005 - Elsevier (see Ethylene glycol poisoning). Propylene glycol Propylene glycol Propylene glycol is considerably less toxic than ethylene glycol and may be labeled as \\"non-toxic antifreeze\\". It is used as antifreeze where ethylene glycol would be inappropriate, such as in food-processing systems or in water pipes in homes where incidental ingestion may be possible. For example, the U.S. FDA allows propylene glycol to be added to a large number of processed foods, including ice cream, frozen custard, salad dressings, and baked goods, and it is commonly used as the main ingredient in the \\"e-liquid\\" used in electronic cigarettes. Propylene glycol oxidizes to lactic acid. Besides cooling system corrosion, biological fouling also occurs. Once bacterial slime starts to grow, the corrosion rate of the system increases. Maintenance of systems using glycol solution includes regular monitoring of freeze protection, pH, specific gravity, inhibitor level, color, and biological contamination. Propylene glycol should be replaced when it turns a reddish color. When an aqueous solution of propylene glycol in a cooling or heating system develops a reddish or black color, this indicates that iron in the system is corroding significantly. In the absence of inhibitors, propylene glycol can react with oxygen and metal ions, generating various compounds including organic acids (e.g., formic, oxalic, acetic). These acids accelerate the corrosion of metals in the system.Hartwick, D.; Hutchinson, D.; Langevin, M., \\"A multi-discipline approach to closed system treatment,\\" Corrosion 2004; New Orleans, Louisiana; March 28 - April 1, 2004; NACE (National Association of Corrosion Engineers) paper 04-322.

Other antifreezes Propylene glycol methyl ether is used as an antifreeze in diesel engines. It is more volatile than glycol. Once used for automotive antifreeze, glycerol has the advantage of being non-toxic, withstands relatively high temperatures, and is noncorrosive. It is not however used widely. Glycerol was historically used as an antifreeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol. Glycerol is mandated for use as an antifreeze in many sprinkler systems. Measuring the freeze point Once antifreeze has been mixed with water and put into use, it periodically needs to be maintained. If engine coolant leaks, boils, or if the cooling system needs to be drained and refilled, the antifreeze's freeze protection will need to be considered. In other cases a vehicle may need to be operated in a colder environment, requiring more antifreeze and less water. Three methods are commonly employed to determine the freeze point of the solution:Engine Cooling Testing: Why use a refractometer? posted 2/7/2001 by Michael Reimer # Specific gravity‚Äî(using a hydrometer test strip or some sort of floating indicator), # Refractometer‚Äîwhich measures the refractive index of the antifreeze solution and translates it into freeze point, and # Test strips‚Äîspecialized, disposable indicators made for this purpose. Although ethylene glycol hydrometers are widely available and mass-marketed for antifreeze testing, they give false readings at high temperatures because specific gravity changes with temperature. Propylene glycol solutions cannot be tested using specific gravity because of ambiguous results (40% and 100% solutions have the same specific gravity).  Corrosion inhibitors Most commercial antifreeze formulations include corrosion inhibiting compounds, and a colored dye (commonly a fluorescent green, red, orange, yellow, or blue) to aid in identification.Coolants Matrix 2003_5.xls. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-01-01. A 1:1 dilution with water is usually used, resulting in a freezing point of about , depending on the formulation. In warmer or colder areas, weaker or stronger dilutions are used, respectively, but a range of 40%/60% to 60%/40% is frequently specified to ensure corrosion protection, and 70%/30% for maximum freeze prevention down to . Maintenance In the absence of leaks, antifreeze chemicals such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol may retain their basic properties indefinitely. By contrast, corrosion inhibitors are gradually used up, and must be replenished from time to time. Larger systems (such as HVAC systems) are often monitored by specialist firms which take responsibility for adding corrosion inhibitors and regulating coolant composition. For simplicity, most automotive manufacturers recommend periodic complete replacement of engine coolant, to simultaneously renew corrosion inhibitors and remove accumulated contaminants.  Traditional inhibitors  Traditionally, there were two major corrosion inhibitors used in vehicles: silicates and phosphates. American-made vehicles traditionally used both silicates and phosphates. European makes contain silicates and other inhibitors, but no phosphates. Japanese makes traditionally use phosphates and other inhibitors, but no silicates.

Retrieved on 2011-01-01.), or with a hybrid organic acid technology (HOAT) formulation (e.g., Zerex G-05), both of which are claimed to have an extended service life of five years or . DEX-COOL specifically has caused controversy. Litigation has linked it with intake manifold gasket failures in General Motors' (GM's) 3.1L and 3.4L engines, and with other failures in 3.8L and 4.3L engines. One of the anti-corrosion components presented as sodium or potassium 2-ethylhexanoate and ethylhexanoic acid is incompatible with nylon 6,6 and silicone rubber, and is a known plasticizer. Class action lawsuits were registered in several states of the US, and in Canada, to address some of these claims. The first of these to reach a decision was in Missouri, where a settlement was announced early in December 2007.Tentative Settlement of GM DEX-COOL Class Action Suit Late in March 2008, GM agreed to compensate complainants in the remaining 49 states.DEX-COOL Litigation Website GM (Motors Liquidation Company) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, which tied up the outstanding claims until a court determines who gets paid. According to the DEX-COOL manufacturer, \\"mixing a 'green' [non-OAT] coolant with DEX-COOL reduces the batch's change interval to 2 years or 30,000 miles, but will otherwise cause no damage to the engine\\".Draft‚ÄîDEX 2007, Part 3: Now It‚Äôs All Up To The Judges and Juries. Imcool.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-01. DEX-COOL antifreeze uses two inhibitors: sebacate and 2-EHA (2-ethylhexanoic acid), the latter which works well with the hard water found in the United States, but is a plasticizer that can cause gaskets to leak. According to internal GM documents, the ultimate culprit appears to be operating vehicles for long periods of time with low coolant levels. The low coolant is caused by pressure caps that fail in the open position. (The new caps and recovery bottles were introduced at the same time as DEX-COOL). This exposes hot engine components to air and vapors, causing corrosion and contamination of the coolant with iron oxide particles, which in turn can aggravate the pressure cap problem as contamination holds the caps open permanently. Honda and Toyota's new extended life coolant use OAT with sebacate, but without the 2-EHA. Some added phosphates provide protection while the OAT builds up. Honda specifically excludes 2-EHA from their formulas. Typically, OAT antifreeze contains an orange dye to differentiate it from the conventional glycol-based coolants (green or yellow), though some OAT products may contain a red or mauve dye. Some of the newer OAT coolants claim to be compatible with all types of OAT and glycol-based coolants; these are typically green or yellow in color.  Hybrid organic acid technology  HOAT coolants typically mix an OAT with a traditional inhibitor, usually silicates. An example is Zerex G05, which is a low-silicate, phosphate free formula that includes the benzoate inhibitor. A HOAT coolant can have a life expectancy as high as 10 years / 180,000 miles.  Phosphate hybrid organic acid technology  P-HOAT coolants mix phosphates with HOAT. This technology is typically used in Asian makes and is often dyed red or blue.  Silicate hybrid organic acid technology  Si- OAT coolants mix silicates with HOAT. This technology is typically used in European makes and is often dyed pink. Additives All automotive antifreeze formulations, including the newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous because of the blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and corrosion inhibitors.A safe and effective propylene glycol based capture liquid for fruit fly traps baited with synthetic lures ‚Äì page 2Florida Entomologist. Findarticles.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-01. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which are considered to be significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and dextrin (hydroxyethyl starch). Disodium fluorescein dye is added to conventional ethylene glycol formulas to visually distinguish leaked amounts from other vehicle fluids, and as a marker of type to distinguish it from incompatible types. This dye fluoresces bright green when illuminated by blue or UV light from daylight or testing lamps. Automotive antifreeze has a characteristic odor due to the additive tolytriazole, a corrosion inhibitor. The unpleasant odor in industrial use tolytriazole comes from impurities in the product that are formed from the toluidine isomers (ortho-, meta- and para-toluidine) and meta-diamino toluene which are side- products in the manufacture of tolytriazole.VOGT, P.

He was the leader of the Mouvement National R√©publicain political party, but retired in 2008 from all political action. Youth and studies Born in Paris, Bruno M√©gret studied at the √âcole Polytechnique and at the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, and is by profession a senior civil servant. He also holds a Master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley. A graduate of the armored cavalry school of Saumur, he is also a reserve army captain.Romain Rosso L'ascension d'un homme dangereux L'Express, 26 February 1998 Bruno M√©gret was ranked 317th at the competition for entrance at √âcole Polytechnique in 1969, and since at that time only 300 candidates were admitted every year, he could enter only because some students preferred to study at the slightly more prestigious √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and turned down the √âcole Polytechnique. However, at √âcole Polytechnique he proved a very dedicated student, and was ranked 18th at the end of the studies. This enabled him to choose between the √âcole des Mines and the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es to finish his engineering studies. After graduating from the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, he spent the academic year 1974‚Äì1975 in Berkeley, and obtained a Master of Science. He then returned to France to work for the Minist√®re de l'√âquipement. The Club de l'Horloge In 1975, he met Yvan Blot at the Commissariat G√©n√©ral du Plan, who invited him to join the Club de l'Horloge. At the Club de l'Horloge, he became friends with Jean- Claude Bardet and Jean-Yves Le Gallou, who with Yvan Blot were also members of the GRECE. In 1977, Bruno M√©gret started to work as an engineer on highway construction, at the Direction D√©partementale de l'√âquipement (DDE) of Essonne. During this period, he contributed to the publications of the Club de l'Horloge. In 1979, he became technical advisor to the minister of cooperation Robert Galley.

However, the appearance of the Front National at the European Parliament elections of 1984, shattered the hopes of the CAR which did not even manage to have a list of candidates for these elections.

However, the relationship between Le Pen and M√©gret turned sour during the following decade. M√©gret and others inside the Front started criticizing Le Pen's \\"extremist\\" positions, which, they argued, prevented the Front from obtaining political executive positions. Moreover, Bruno M√©gret started to become very popular with the party members, winning large support against his rival Bruno Gollnisch, who had been made vice- president and general secretary of the Front National by Le Pen in 1995.

It controlled Allied ground operations in northern Burma. For most of its existence, NCAC was commanded by US Army General Joseph \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stilwell (who concurrently held more senior command positions). In 1945 after Stilwell was recalled, his deputy, Lieutenant General Daniel Sultan, was promoted to and assumed command. Chinese National Army personnel constituted most of the combat units within NCAC. While it was initially intended that NCAC would operate as an integral part of the British 11th Army Group, Stilwell refused to work under General George Giffard and was made subordinate to the Supreme Commander of SEAC, Lord Louis Mountbatten. Composition In 1942, Northern Combat Area Command was formed at Ramgarh Cantonment, in India, from X Force: units (including the 22nd and 38th Divisions), which had retreated out of Burma. After its arrival in India, X Force was reinforced ‚Äì eventually becoming the New 1st Army ‚Äì a corps-level formation. It was re-equipped at British expense and re-trained by US Army instructors. For the campaigning season of early 1944, NCAC was augmented with Merrill's Marauders ‚Äì a brigade-sized formation created by the US Army for commando-type operations in Burma. During 1944, NCAC forced the Japanese 18th Division to retreat out of northern Burma and US Army engineering battalions, assisted by Indian laborers built the Ledo Road ‚Äì which joined the northern end of the Burma Road and reestablished communications between India and China. Towards the end of 1944, NCAC was reinforced by the British 36th Infantry Division. In 1945, under Sultan's command, NCAC ‚Äì which now included the Chinese New 6th Army ‚Äì aided in the drive to retake the rest of Burma. Campaigns The main combat power of NCAC, at least in terms of numbers were its Chinese divisions. When British and Chinese forces had been bundled out of Burma at the start of 1942, some Chinese forces had been obliged to retreat to India, rather than to China. It was from these formations that the genesis of NCAC came. Many times during World War II, British and American commanders in India were frustrated by their Chinese allies. A combination of fickleness and over-centralisation by the Chinese generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek and the limited training of the Chinese forces meant that they often failed to live up to their potential. However, the Chinese forces in NCAC were considerably better than their contemporaries in China itself. Greater access to American equipment and training and less influence from the Chinese leadership meant the four Chinese divisions in NCAC could be trusted a great deal more in combat. However, it was not only from NCAC's divisions that trouble sprang. Its first commander was an extremely controversial character. Stilwell had first been posted to China as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek. However, as the campaign in Burma developed, he also took on a role there. The US Army established the China Burma India Theater (CBI Theater), and placed Stilwell in command. The CBI Theater was not supposed to be an operational headquarters. It was merely supposed to be in charge of the administration of the American military formations in China, Burma and India. However, Stilwell often broke the chain of command and communicated directly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on operational matters, when all such communications were supposed to go to Admiral Lord Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia and also on taking operational control of NCAC through General George Giffard commander of 11th Army Group. The initial idea was that as General Stilwell would be commanding several Chinese divisions which would attack out of India from the West and with the large but amorphous Yunnan armies attacking out of China from the East, he would be commanding a large army. So his command should be placed under 11th Army Group at the same level as the Fourteenth which was under the command of General William Slim. The attacks could then be co-ordinated at Army Group level. At a meeting to sort out the operational chain of command for the three fronts in Burma, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying \\"I am prepared to come under General Slim's operational control until I get to Kamaing\\". Rather than sack him, Mountbatten reluctantly agreed to this, but it was a dangerous compromise. It created a complicated chain of command where Slim theoretically had to report to two different commanders. Giffard for Fourteenth Army actions and Mountbatten for Stilwell's formations. Under a general less gifted than Slim this could have caused serious problems, if Slim had not been able to command Stilwell at an operational level without disagreement (which given Stilwell's proven track record was more than likely). But at an operational level Slim was able to work with Stilwell and \\"this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well\\". The reason why it was essential that there was one operational commander for the three fronts, North, Central and Southern, was so that the intended attacks in late 1944 could be co-ordinated to prevent the Japanese concentrating large numbers of reserves for a counterattack on any one front. Stilwell thus had four different jobs to perform, which required him to be in different places at once. For example, as Chief of Staff to Chiang, he was often needed in Chungking, the Chinese capital, and as Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was needed at HQ South East Asia Command at Kandy in Ceylon and as NCAC commander he was required to be relatively near the frontline in Burma. His personality also caused problems. Stilwell clashed frequently with the commander of the 11th Army Group, General Giffard, and would not accept being under his command, instead insisting that NCAC came directly under the Supreme Commander. As Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was Giffard's superior but as operational commander of NCAC Giffard was his superior, as the two men did not get on this inevitably lead to conflict and confusion. NCAC's first months were frustrating, as the time was for all Allied formations in the theater. Its first real success did not come until the 1943-44 campaigning season. The Chindits had been dropped behind enemy lines after the end of the 1943 monsoon to cause havoc by cutting communications. This they did, but the original operational plan failed for a number of reasons. In the end, they were sent northwards into NCAC's area of operations. At the time, NCAC's main job was to capture the town of Myitkyina, as a prelude to connecting the Ledo Road to the Burma Road and reestablishing land communications to China. During the offensive, NCAC intelligence staff serving under General Stilwell repeatedly underestimated Japanese troop strength in Burma. A thrust from the northwest by NCAC was meeting with some success, but Stilwell also needed to use the Chindits in his plan. However, he not only used them but misused them. The Chindits were designed as a light raiding force, not as conventional infantry. They had negligible artillery support and were much smaller in number than equivalent conventional formations. However, Stilwell insisted on using them as conventional infantry. He assigned them the task of capturing Mogaung south of Myitkyina, which was strongly held by the Japanese. The Chindits succeeded in their task but had horrendous casualties. Even then Stilwell was not finished. He demanded still further miracles from the Chindits and their commander Brigadier Lentaigne. Reduced to the equivalent of less than a battalion, the Chindits assisted in the final assault on Myitkyina before finally bein flown out to India as a completely broken force, almost to a man. The American equivalent of the Chindits, Merrill's Marauders also suffered from the same treatment during the campaign, consistently being asked to perform missions that were beyond their power without superhuman effort. After the fall of Myitkyina, only a small area of Japanese territory separated NCAC from the Chinese forces. As the 1944 monsoon ended, NCAC opened an offensive. It had been reinforced with the British 36th Infantry Division, which gave it a considerably increased punch. However, the Japanese 33rd Army under General Masaki Honda performed a very creditable delaying action against the forces attacking them. The Japanese were outnumbered several times but still managed to hold the Chinese forces at bay for several months. In the end, it was events on the main front further south that forced them to withdraw, as they were in danger of being cut off from their supply lines. 36th Division was used to support the left-wing of the Fourteenth Army under Lieutenant General William Slim. In October 1944, due to personal disagreements with Chiang, Stilwell was recalled to the United States by President Roosevelt. His former role was split as was the CBI Theater: * Lieutenant General Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia. * Major General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT). * Lieutenant General Daniel Isom Sultan was promoted from deputy commander of CBI to become commander of the U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. His replacements were not only less abrasive characters but as they each concentrated on one area there was less institutional conflict and confusion. NCAC's main role in the last few months of the war was to support the British main offensive further south and to further improve the Burma Road to allow more supplies to get into China. After the war, NCAC was quickly disbanded. It had achieved its objectives, but the route to those objectives was strewn with command problems and missed opportunities.

The establishment of the Supreme Caracas Junta following the forced deposition of Vicente Emparan as Captain General of the Captaincy General of Venezuela on 19 April 1810, marked the beginnings of the war. On 5 July 1811, seven of the ten provinces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared their independence in the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. The First Republic of Venezuela was lost in 1812 following the 1812 Caracas earthquake and the Battle of La Victoria (1812). Sim√≥n Bol√≠var led an \\"Admirable Campaign\\" to retake Venezuela, establishing the Second Republic of Venezuela in 1813; but this too did not last, falling to a combination of a local uprising and Spanish royalist reconquest. Only as part of Bol√≠var's campaign to liberate New Granada in 1819-20 did Venezuela achieve a lasting independence from Spain (initially as part of Gran Colombia). On 17 December 1819, the Congress of Angostura declared Gran Colombia an independent country. After two more years of war, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of its most famous son, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Venezuela, along with the countries of Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, formed part of the Republic of Gran Colombia until 1830, when Venezuela separated and became a sovereign state. First Republic (1810‚Äì1812) The French invasion of Spain in 1808 led to the collapse of the Spanish Monarchy. Most subjects of Spain did not accept the government of Joseph Bonaparte, placed on the Spanish throne by his brother, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France. At the same time, the process of creating a stable government in Spain, which would be widely recognized throughout the empire, took two years. (See Junta (Peninsular War).) This created a power vacuum in the Spanish possessions in America, which created further political uncertainty. On April 19, 1810 the municipal council of Caracas headed a successful movement to depose the Spanish Governor and Captain General, Vicente Empar√°n. A junta was established in Caracas, and soon other Venezuelan provinces followed suit. The reverberations of this act of independence could be felt throughout Venezuela almost immediately. Across Venezuela, towns and cities decided to either side with the movement based in Caracas or not, and de facto civil war ensued throughout much of Venezuela. The Caracas Junta called for a congress of Venezuelan provinces to establish a government for the region. Initially, both the Junta and Congress upheld the \\"rights of Ferdinand VII,\\" meaning that they recognized themselves to still be part of the Spanish Monarchy, but had established a separate government due to the French invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. As the Congress deliberated, a faction proposing outright independence quickly won favor. Persons such as Francisco de Miranda, a long-term Venezuelan expatriate, and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, a young, Criollo aristocrat‚Äîboth influenced by Age of Enlightenment ideas and the example of the French Revolution‚Äîled the movement. The Congress declared Venezuela's independence on 5 July 1811, establishing the Republic of Venezuela. Even before the Congress began its sessions in November 1810, a civil war started between those who supported the juntas, and eventually independence, and royalists who wanted to maintain the union with Spain. Two provinces, Maracaibo Province and Guayana Province, and one district, Coro, never recognized the Caracas Junta and remained loyal to the governments in Spain. Military expeditions to bring Coro and Guayana under the control of the Republic failed. In 1811 an uprising in Valencia against the Republic was successfully suppressed. By 1812 the situation increasingly became aggravated for the young Republic. It was short of funds, Spanish Regency set up a blockade (although it was easily bypassed by British and American merchant ships), and, shortly after, on 26 March 1812, a devastating earthquake affected republican areas. In these desperate moments, Miranda was given dictatorial powers, nevertheless, he was unable to stem the royalist advance headed by Captain Domingo de Monteverde. By midyear, after the Battle of San Mateo, the Republic collapsed. Miranda capitulated to Monteverde and signed an armistice on 25 July 1812. Second Republic (1813‚Äì1814) Bol√≠var and other republicans continued the resistance from other parts of the Spanish South America and the Caribbean, or organized guerrilla movements in the interior of the country. In 1813 Bol√≠var joined the army of United Provinces of New Granada. After winning a series of battles, Bol√≠var received the approval of the New Granadan Congress to lead a liberating force into Venezuela in what became known as the Admirable Campaign. At the same time, Santiago Mari√±o invaded from the northeast in an independently organized campaign. Both forces quickly defeated the royalist troops in various battles, such as Alto de los Godos. Bol√≠var entered Caracas on 6 August 1813, proclaiming the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and his supreme leadership of it, something which was not fully recognized by Mari√±o based in Cuman√°, although the two leaders did cooperate militarily. In the viceroyalties of La Plata and New Granada the Creoles displaced the Spanish authorities with relative ease, as Caracas had done at first. The autonomous movement swept through New Granada, but the country remained politically disunited. Bogot√° inherited the role of capital from Spain, but the royalists were entrenched in southern Colombia (Popay√°n and Pasto). Cali was a bastion of the independence movement just north of royalist territory. Cartagena declared independence not only from Spain but also from Bogot√°. Bol√≠var arrived in Cartagena and was well received, as he was later in Bogot√°, where he joined the army of the United Provinces of New Granada. He recruited a force and invaded Venezuela from the southwest, by crossing the Andes (1813). His chief lieutenant was the headstrong Jos√© F√©lix Ribas. In Trujillo, an Andean province, Bol√≠var emitted his infamous Decree of War to the Death with which he hoped to get the pardos and any mantuano who was having second thoughts on his side. At the time that Bol√≠var was victorious in the west, Santiago Mari√±o and Manuel Piar, a pardo from the Dutch island of Cura√ßao, were successfully fighting royalists in eastern Venezuela. Quickly losing ground (much as Miranda had a year earlier) Monteverde took refuge in Puerto Cabello, and Bol√≠var occupied Caracas, re- establishing the Republic, with two \\"states\\", one in the west headed by Bol√≠var and one in the east headed by Mari√±o. But neither the successful invasions nor Bol√≠var's decree were provoking a massive enrollment of pardos in the cause of Independence. Rather it was the other way around. In the Llanos a populist Spanish immigrant caudillo, Jos√© Tom√°s Boves, initiated a widespread pardo movement against the restored Republic. Bol√≠var and Ribas held and defended the mantuano-controlled center of Venezuela. In the east, the royalists started recovering territory. After suffering a setback, Mari√±o and Bol√≠var joined their forces, but they were defeated by Boves in 1814. Republicans were forced to evacuate Caracas and flee to the east, where, in the port of Car√∫pano, Piar was still holding out. Piar, however, did not accept Bol√≠var's supreme command, and once again Bol√≠var left Venezuela and went to New Granada (1815). (See Bol√≠var in New Granada). Resistance to the Republic this time came from the people of the vast southern plains, the Llaneros, who organized under the command of Spanish immigrant, Jos√© Tom√°s Boves. The war was transformed. The Llaneros had a dislike for the urban and elite Criollos who led the independence movement. Boves's Llanero army routinely killed white Venezuelans.Parma, Alessandro. A First-Hand Impreof the Venezuelan Opposition VenezuelaAnalysis.com. 25 November 2005. Negroes were supplied with maps and lists of rebel plantations by royalists. The Llanero army routed the patriots in the center of the country. Finally Boves marched towards Caracas, forcing the Republicans to flee to the east of the country, ending the second republic. The traditional image of the Venezuelan llanos swarming with caudillos like Boves exaggerates the situation. Boves was the only significant pro-Spain caudillo and he was acting in concert with Francisco Tom√°s Morales, who was a regular officer of Spain. In the Battle of Urica, Boves was killed and Morales took command and carried out mopping up operations against the remaining patriot resistance, which included the capture and execution of Ribas. As was still common in the early 19th century, Morales had his head boiled in oil (to preserve it) and sent to Caracas. (See the Execution of Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico.) Boves died shortly thereafter in battle, but the country had been returned to royalist control. Morillo arrived in Venezuela and began operations with Morales. Spanish reconquest of New Granada (1815‚Äì1816) In Spain, anti-French forces had liberated the country, and the restored Ferdinand VII sent a large expeditionary force to Venezuela and New Granada under Pablo Morillo, who had distinguished himself during Spain's War of Independence. Royalist forces under Morillo and Morales captured Cartagena and Bogot√° in 1816. Before leaving for New Granada Morillo had decommissioned most of the irregular forces that had fought under Boves, except those that he took to New Granada. With little prospects, some pardos and llaneros began to join the rebellions that were breaking out against Spanish rule in the broad plains of southern Venezuela. In the meantime, Bol√≠var chose to sail to Jamaica to enlist British aid, which was refused. From there, he went to Haiti, which had been the first Latin American republic to become independent. With the support of the Haitian president Alexandre P√©tion and with the naval aid of Luis Bri√≥n, another √©migr√©, who was a merchant from Cura√ßao, Bol√≠var returned to Margarita Island, a secure republican redoubt, but his command of the republican forces was still not firm. Mari√±o, who had come back with Bol√≠var from Haiti, headed his own expeditions and succeeded in temporarily capturing Cuman√° in 1817. With Bri√≥n supplying a small fleet, Bol√≠var sailed west along the Venezuelan coast to Ocumare de la Costa (the Expedition of Los Cayos), where, in fulfillment of P√©tion's request, he officially proclaimed the end of slavery (although this went unheeded). Morales, back in Venezuela after subduing New Granada, attacked the republican expeditionary force with an army that vastly outnumbered the republicans. Bol√≠var fled, sailing once again to Haiti with Bri√≥n. However, Piar and Gregor MacGregor, a Scottish soldier of fortune, who had previously been active in New Granada, managed to escape with their forces into the interior of the country, defeating Morales at El Juncal in September 1816 before moving south to Guayana. Boves's locally raised Llanero army was replaced in 1815 by a formal expedition sent from Spain under the leadership of Pablo Morillo. It was the largest expedition the Spanish had ever sent to the Americas. Venezuela's proximity to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Spain made it the first target of the royalist counterattack. The Llaneros were either demobilized or incorporated into the expeditionary units. The republican patriots found themselves once more dispersed, and again the war took a local character. Different patriot guerrilla bands formed, but could not agree on a united leadership, much less a united strategy. One group of patriots launched an expedition to eastern Venezuela that ended in failure. Bol√≠var thereafter sought to join forces with Manuel Piar, another patriot leader but differences between them prevented a united republican front. Bol√≠var then went to the Llanos where he joined forces with Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, but a failed attack on central Venezuela forced Bolivar to retreat back to Apure. Morillo counterattacked successfully but was defeated at the Battle of Las Queseras del Medio. A long-term stalemate ensued in which the royalists controlled the highly populated, urban north and the republicans the vast, under-populated plains of the south. Stalemate (1816‚Äì1819) Bol√≠var and Bri√≥n returned and tried in 1817 to capture Barcelona, where the Spaniards repulsed them. In the meantime, Piar and Mari√±o had occupied defenceless Angostura (a city at the narrowest and deepest part of the Orinoco River, hence its name, subsequently changed to Ciudad Bol√≠var), to where Bol√≠var headed and was chosen as supreme leader of the independence movement. (It was at this time that Bol√≠var ordered the addition of a new star for Guayana to the seven stars on the Venezuelan flag, which represented the number of provinces that originally had favored independence. Since Bol√≠var played a central role in the symbolism of the Venezuelan government led by Ch√°vez, this long-forgotten change was revived in the 2006 revision to the flag.) Once in Guayana, Bol√≠var quickly cashiered Piar, who had been trying (or was accused of trying‚Äîhistorians still debate this) to form a pardo force of his own, by having him arrested and executed after a court martial in which Bri√≥n was one of the judges. British veterans of the Napoleonic wars began arriving in Venezuela, where they formed the nucleus of what later became known as the British Legion. Morillo returned to Caracas and Morales was given troops to dominate eastern Venezuela, which he did successfully. Francisco de Paula Santander, a New Granadan who had retreated to the llanos after Morillo's invasion, met with Bol√≠var and agreed to join forces. Morillo's other lieutenant, the second in command of the expeditionary force, Miguel de la Torre, was ordered to put down a significant rebellion in the llanos of Apure led by Jos√© Antonio P√°ez. At the time in the Southern Cone of South America, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n had concluded the liberation of Chile with the essential support of the Chilean Bernardo O'Higgins. The year 1818 saw a stalemate between the patriots based in Angostura (and free-wheeling in part of the llanos) and Morillo (entrenched in Caracas, triumphant in eastern Venezuela, and operating in the llanos as far as Apure). This is the time during which (according to Marx), Bol√≠var dilly- dallied and lost one skirmish after another, also saying that European officers in Angostura were egging him on to attack the center of Venezuela. (Bol√≠var did attempt to do so, but suffered defeat at La Puerta.) At the time James Rooke did in fact command over 1,000 European soldiers within Bol√≠var's army in Venezuela. But Morillo had larger forces, and not just of Spanish line troops but also of pardos still loyal to the Spanish crown. In 1819 Bol√≠var proclaimed the republic of Great Colombia, which included Venezuela and New Granada. New volunteers arrived in Venezuela, though most, like those that preceded them, were in essence mercenaries probably under the illusion that there were fortunes to be made in Venezuela, which was hardly the case. There is no evidence that the British government was backing them, but since Spain was no longer a British ally, it was not hindering them either. In Europe, generally, Bol√≠var's name was known as was the Spanish American movement for independence, which had the sympathy of every liberal-minded person, as did the independence of Greece, then also in the process of emancipation. Morillo had his hands full and pardos were starting to look towards patriot leaders. Campaigns in eastern Venezuela began turning the tide for independence and in the llanos P√°ez defeated Morillo and Morales in Apure. This cleared the way for Bol√≠var and Santander to invade New Granada, where, in Pantano de Vargas, the Spaniards were defeated in a battle in which the British Legion played a central role and its commander, Rooke, was killed in action. In the battle of Boyac√° (1819), Spanish power was crushed in New Granada, except in the south. P√°ez occupied Barinas and, from New Granada, Bol√≠var invaded Venezuela.  Consolidation of independence  Detail of The Battle of Carabobo (1887) by Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar. Federal Capitol of Venezuela. In 1819, to break this impasse Bol√≠var invaded New Granada, which had been reconquered by Morillo's expeditionary force three years earlier. Bol√≠var decisively defeated the royalists at Boyac√°. With the liberation of New Granada, the republicans had a significant base from which to attack Morillo's forces. A republican Congress at Angostura (today Ciudad Bol√≠var), which already had a small New Granada delegation, declared the union of New Granada and Venezuela in a Republic of Colombia (the Gran Colombia of contemporary accounts) to present a united front against the Spanish Monarchy. In 1821, the Gran Colombian army won a decisive victory at the second Battle of Carabobo, after which the only cities in the hands of the royalist forces were Cuman√°, which fell shortly thereafter, and Puerto Cabello, which managed to resist a siege before finally capitulating in October 1823.  Aftermath  The Spanish sent a fleet in 1823 to reconquer the country but were defeated at the Battle of Lake Maracaibo.Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management. Venezuela, 13. In the following years Venezuelan forces, as part of the army of Gran Colombia, continued campaigning under the leadership of Bol√≠var to liberate the southern parts of New Granada and Ecuador. Once this was accomplished, Gran Colombia continued its fight against the Spanish in Peru and Bolivia, completing the efforts of Chilean and Argentine patriots, such as Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who liberated southern South America.

History The Klondike bar was created by the Isaly Dairy Company of Mansfield, Ohio in the early 1920s and named after the Klondike River of Yukon, Canada.Butko, Brian. Klondikes, Chipped Ham, & Skyscraper Cones: The Story of Isaly's. Stackpole Books (2001). Rights to the name were eventually sold to Good Humor-Breyers, a division of Unilever. The first recorded advertisement for the Klondike was on February 5, 1922, in the Youngstown Vindicator. The bars are generally wrapped with a silver-colored wrapper depicting a polar bear mascot for the brand. Unlike a traditional frozen ice pop, or traditional ice cream bar, the Klondike bar does not have a stick due to its size, a point often touted in advertising. In 1976, Henry Clarke, owner of the Clabir company, purchased the rights to the Klondike bar, which had been manufactured and sold by the Isaly's restaurant chain since the 1930s. Clarke introduced Klondike bars to consumers throughout the United States during the 1980s. Under Clarke, sales of the Klondike bar increased from $800,000 annually at the time of the 1976 acquisition by Clabir to more than $60 million. In 1986, the US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals prohibited Kraft Foods from using a wrapper resembling the distinctive Klondike bar wrapper (its \\"trade dress\\") for Kraft's \\"Polar B'ar\\" brand ice cream bars. The following year, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the lower court ruling. In 1988, Kraft settled a trademark dispute with Ambrit Inc., as the former Isaly Company, Inc. was then known, for $8.5 million.

All 69 passengers and crew aboard the Tupolev and both crew members of the Boeing were killed. The official investigation by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (, (BFU)) identified as the main cause of the collision a number of shortcomings on the part of the Swiss Air Traffic Controller (ATC) service in charge of the sector involved as well as ambiguities in the procedures regarding the use of Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), the on-board aircraft collision avoidance system.Section 3.2 \\"Causes\\", page 110 A year and a half after the crash, on 24 February 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the collision, was murdered in an apparent act of revenge by Vitaly Kaloyev, a Russian citizen who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.  Flights involved  Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937 was a chartered flight from Moscow, Russia, to Barcelona, Spain, carrying 60 passengers and nine crew. Forty-five of the passengers were Russian schoolchildren from the city of Ufa, in Bashkortostan, on a school trip organised by the local UNESCO committee to the Costa Dorada area of Spain. Most of the parents of the children were high-ranking officials in Bashkortostan.\\"Children's holiday party on doomed plane.\\" CNN. 4 July 2002. Retrieved on 28 April 2010. One of the fathers was the head of the local UNESCO committee. The aircraft, a 1995-built Tupolev Tu-154M registered as was piloted by an experienced Russian crew: 52-year-old Captain Alexander Mihailovich Gross (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä–æ—Å—Å) and 40-year-old First Officer Oleg Pavlovich Grigoriev (–û–ª–µ–≥ –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä—å–µ–≤). The captain had more than 12,000 flight hours (including 4,918 hours on the Tu-154) to his credit. Grigoriev, the chief pilot of Bashkirian Airlines, had 8,500 hours of flying experience (with 4,317 hours on the Tu-154) and his task was to evaluate Captain Gross's performance throughout the flight. 41-year-old Murat Ahatovich Itkulov (–ú—É—Ä–∞—Ç –ê—Ö–∞—Ç–æ–≤–∏—á –ò—Ç–∫—É–ª–æ–≤), a seasoned pilot with close to 7,900 flight hours (with 4,181 of them on the Tu-154), who was normally the first officer, did not officially serve on duty, because this was the captain's assessment flight. 50-year-old Sergei Gennadyevich Kharlov (–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥—å–µ–≤–∏—á –•–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤), a flight navigator with approximately 13,000 flight hours (including 6,421 hours on the Tu-154), and 37-year-old Flight Engineer Oleg Irikovich Valeev (–û–ª–µ–≥ –ò—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –í–∞–ª–µ–µ–≤), who had almost 4,200 flight hours (all of which were on the Tu-154), joined the three pilots in the cockpit. DHL Flight 611, a Boeing 757-23APF cargo aircraft built in 1990 and registered as had originated in Bahrain and was being flown by two Bahrain-based pilots, 47-year-old British Captain Paul Phillips and 34-year-old Canadian First Officer Brant Campioni. Both pilots were very experienced ‚Äî Phillips had logged close to 12,000 flight hours (including 4,145 hours on the Boeing 757) and Campioni had accumulated more than 6,600 flight hours, with 176 of them on the Boeing 757. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was en route from Bergamo, Italy, to Brussels, Belgium. Accident Skyguide Air Navigation Center Z√ºrich in Wangen bei D√ºbendorf The two aircraft were flying at flight level 360 () on a collision course. Despite being just inside the German border, the airspace was controlled from Z√ºrich, Switzerland, by the private Swiss airspace control company Skyguide. The only air traffic controller handling the airspace, Peter Nielsen, was working two workstations at the same time. Partly because of the added workload, and partly because of delayed radar data, he did not realise the problem in time and thus failed to keep the aircraft at a safe distance from each other. Less than a minute before the accident he realised the danger and contacted Flight 2937, instructing the pilot to descend to flight level 350 to avoid collision with crossing traffic (Flight 611). Seconds after the Russian crew initiated the descent, their traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) instructed them to climb, while at about the same time the TCAS on Flight 611 instructed the pilots of that aircraft to descend.Section 4 \\"Safety Recommendations\\", pages 111‚Äì113 Had both aircraft followed those automated instructions, the collision would not have occurred.Section 1.16.2 \\"ACAS/TCAS II analysis\\", page 34 Flight 611's pilots on the Boeing jet followed the TCAS instructions and initiated a descent, but could not immediately inform Nielsen because the controller was dealing with Flight 2937. About eight seconds before the collision, Flight 611's descent rate was about , not quite as rapid as the range advised by that jet's TCAS; as for the Tupolev, the pilot disregarded his jet's TCAS instruction to climb, having already commenced his descent as instructed by the controller.Section 2.7 \\"Analysis summary\\", pages 104‚Äì106 Thus, both planes were now descending. Unaware of the TCAS-issued alerts, Nielsen repeated his instruction to Flight 2937 to descend, giving the Tupolev crew incorrect information as to the position of the DHL plane (telling them that the Boeing was to the right of the Tupolev when it was in fact to the left).Section 2.4.1 \\"ATC Zurich\\", page 76 Eight seconds before the collision, Flight 2937's crew finally realised their actual position when they gained visual sight of Flight 611 incoming from the left. Flight 611, in response, increased its descent rate.Section 2.2.1 \\"Boeing B757-200\\", pages 68‚Äì69Section 2.2.2 \\"Tupolev TU154M\\", pages 69‚Äì71 Two seconds before the collision, Flight 2937's pilots finally obeyed the jet's TCAS instruction to climb and attempted to put the aircraft into a climb, but the collision was now inevitable. The aircraft collided at 23:35:32 local time (21:35 UTC), at almost a right angle at an altitude of , with the Boeing's vertical stabiliser slicing completely through Flight 2937's fuselage just ahead of the Tupolev's wings. The Tupolev broke into several pieces, scattering wreckage over a wide area. The nose section of the aircraft fell vertically, while the tail section with the engines continued, stalled, and fell. The crippled Boeing, now with 80% of its vertical stabiliser lost, struggled for a further before crashing into a wooded area close to the village of Taisersdorf at a 70-degree downward angle. Each engine ended up several hundred metres away from the main wreckage, and the tail section was torn from the fuselage by trees just before impact.Section 1.12 \\"Wreckages and impacts information\\", pages 19‚Äì33 All 69 people on the Tupolev, and the 2 on board the Boeing, died.Section 1.2 \\"Injuries to persons\\", page 9 Other factors in the crash Only one air traffic controller, Peter Nielsen of ACC Zurich, was controlling the airspace through which the aircraft were flying. The other controller on duty was resting in another room for the night. This was against Skyguide's regulations but had been a common practice for years and was known and tolerated by management. Maintenance work was being carried out on the main radar image processing system, which meant that the controllers were forced to use a fallback system.Section 1.17.1 \\"ATC Zurich\\", pages 35‚Äì42 The ground-based optical collision warning system, which would have alerted the controller to the pending collision approximately 2 minutes before it happened,Section 2.6.1.4 \\"Warning systems\\", page 88 had been switched off for maintenance. Nielsen was unaware of this. There still was an aural STCA warning system, which released a warning addressed to workstation RE SUED at 23:35:00 (32 seconds before the collision). This warning was not heard by anyone present at that time, although no error in this system could be found in a subsequent technical audit ‚Äî however, whether or not this audible warning is functional is not something which is technically logged. Even if Nielsen had heard this warning, at that time finding a useful resolution order by the air traffic controller was impossible. Deviating statements in the official report A temporary memorial at √úberlingen's Sosa Fountain. All countries involved could add additional \\"deviating\\" statements to the official report. The Kingdom of Bahrain, Switzerland, and the Russian Federation did submit positions that were published with the official report. The U.S. did not submit deviating positions. The deviating statements were published verbatim as an appendix to the report by the German federal investigators. The statement by the Kingdom of Bahrain, the home country of the DHL plane, mostly agrees with the findings of the report. It says that the report should have put less emphasis on the actions of individuals and more on the faults within Skyguide's organisation and management. Bahrain's statement also mentions the lack of crew resource management in the Tupolev's cockpit as a factor in the crash. The Russian Federation states that the Russian pilots were unable to obey the TCAS advisory to climb; the advisory was given when they were already at while the controller wrongly stated there was conflicting traffic above them at . Also, the controller gave the wrong position of the DHL plane (2 o'clock instead of the actual 10 o'clock). Russia asserts that the DHL crew had a \\"real possibility\\" to avoid a collision since they were able to hear the conversation between the Russian crew and the controller. Switzerland notes that the Tupolev was about below the flight level ordered by the Swiss controller, and still descending at . The Swiss say that this was also a cause of the accident. Switzerland also requested that the BFU make a formal finding that the TCAS advisories would have been useful if obeyed immediately; the BFU declined to do so.  Aftermath  A memorial plaque \\"Die zerrissene Perlenkette\\" A memorial plaque The √úberlingen memorial The Skyguide memorial to the aviation accident and murder of Peter Nielsen. Nielsen needed medical attention due to traumatic stress caused by the accident. At Skyguide, his former colleagues maintained a vase with a white rose over Nielsen's former workstation. Skyguide, after initially having blamed the Russian pilot for the accident, accepted full responsibility and asked relatives of the victims for forgiveness. Skyguide paid compensation to the families of the dead children; the compensation amount was about CHF 30,000 ($34,087) to CHF 36,000. The Swiss Federal Court turned down appeals from some relatives for higher compensation in 2011. On 27 July 2006, a court in Konstanz decided that the Federal Republic of Germany should pay compensation to Bashkirian Airlines. The court found that Germany was legally responsible for the actions of Skyguide. The government appealed the ruling, but in late 2013 Bashkirian Airlines and the Federal Republic of Germany reached a tacit agreement, ending the court case before a decision on the legal issues was reached. In another case before the court in Konstanz, Skyguide's liability insurance is suing Bashkirian Airlines for 2.5 million euro in damages. The case was opened in March 2008; the legal questions are expected to be difficult, as the airline has filed for bankruptcy under Russian law. A criminal investigation of Skyguide began in May 2004. On 7 August 2006, a Swiss prosecutor filed manslaughter charges against eight employees of Skyguide. The prosecutor called for prison terms of up to 15 months if found guilty. The verdict was announced in September 2007. Three of the four managers convicted were given suspended prison terms and the fourth was ordered to pay a fine. Another four Skyguide employees were cleared of any wrongdoing.  Murder of Peter Nielsen  Devastated by the loss of his wife and two children aboard flight 2937, Vitaly Kaloyev, a Russian architect, held Peter Nielsen responsible for their deaths. He tracked down and stabbed Nielsen to death, in the presence of Nielsen's wife and three children, at his home in Kloten, near Z√ºrich, on 24 February 2004. The Swiss police arrested Kaloyev at a local motel shortly afterward, and in 2005 he was sentenced to prison for the murder. He was released in November 2007, because his mental condition was not sufficiently considered in the initial sentence. In January 2008, he was appointed deputy construction minister of North Ossetia. In 2016, Kaloyev was awarded the highest state medal by the government, the medal \\"To the Glory of Ossetia\\". The medal is awarded for the highest achievements, improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the region, for educating the younger generation and maintaining law and order.https://www.stav.kp.ru/daily/26487/3357178 Vitaly Kaloyev awarded with the medal \\"To the Glory of Ossetia\\" ALEXEY DROBOTOV TCAS and conflicting orders The accident raised questions as to how pilots must react when they receive conflicting orders from TCAS and from air traffic control (ATC). TCAS was a relatively new technology at the time of the accident, having been mandatoryTCAS was mandatory for aircraft with a maximum certified take-off weight of over 30 tonnes or a seating capacity of over thirty passengers. Both aircraft involved in this accident met the criteria for mandatory TCAS installation. in Europe since 2000. When TCAS issues a resolution advisory (RA), the pilot flying should respond immediately by direct attention to RA displays and maneuver as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardise the safe operation of the flight, or unless the flight crew can assure separation with the help of definitive visual acquisition of the aircraft causing the RA. In responding to a TCAS RA that directs a deviation from assigned altitude, the flight crew should communicate with ATC as soon as practicable after responding to the RA. When the RA is removed, the flight crew should advise ATC that they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or should acknowledge any amended clearance issued. While TCAS is programmed to assume that both crews will promptly follow the system's instructions, the operations manual did not clearly state that TCAS should always take precedence over any ATC commands.page 103: \\"Paragraph 6.1 of the TCAS Pilot's Guide states \\"TCAS 2000 is intended as a back-up to visual collision avoidance, application of 'right-of-way' rules, and ATC separation services\\", and leaves a degree of ambiguity over the interpretation of the term 'back-up'.\\" The manual described TCAS as \\"a backup to the ATC system\\", which could be wrongly interpreted to mean that ATC instructions have higher priority.page 80 \\"The wording \\"TCAS is a backup to the ATC system...\\" could be interpreted that ATC takes priority to TCAS\\" This ambiguity was replicated in the Tu-154 Flight Operations Manual, which contained contradictory sections. On the one hand, chapter 8.18.3.4 emphasised the role of ATC and describes TCAS as an \\"additional aid\\",page 53 \\"For the avoidance of in-flight collisions is the visual control of the situation in the airspace by the crew and the correct execution of all instructions issued by the Air Traffic Controller to be viewed as the most important tool. TCAS is an additional instrument that ensures the timely determination of oncoming traffic, the classification of the risk and, if necessary, planning of an advice for a vertical avoidance manoeuvre.\\" ‚Äì TU154M Flight Operations Manual while chapter 8.18.3.2 forbade manoeuvers contrary to TCAS. The BFU recommended that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of obeying TCAS advisories even when these were in conflict with ATC instructions.page 111 \\"Safety Recommendation 18/2003\\" Prior incident Seventeen months before the Bashkirian Airlines-DHL collision there had already been another incident involving confusion between conflicting TCAS and ATC commands. In 2001, two Japanese airliners nearly collided with each other in Japanese airspace. One of the aircraft had received conflicting orders from TCAS and ATC; one pilot followed the instructions of TCAS while the other did not. A collision was only averted because one of the pilots made evasive maneuvers based on a visual judgement. The aircraft missed each other by about , and the abrupt maneuver necessary to avert disaster left 100 occupants injured on one aircraft, some seriously. In its report, published eleven days after the √úberlingen accident, Japan called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to make it clear that TCAS advisories should always take precedence over ATC instructions. ICAO accepted this recommendation and amended its regulations in November 2003.Flight Safety Digest, March 2004 Technical solutions Before this accident a change proposal (CP 112)Change proposal CP112E for the TCAS II system had been issued. This proposal would have created a \\"reversal\\" of the original warning ‚Äì asking the DHL plane to climb and the Tupolev crew to descend. According to an analysis by Eurocontrol this would have avoided the collision if the DHL crew had received and followed the new instructions and the Tupolev had continued to descend. All TCAS II equipped aircraft have been upgraded to support RA reversal.

History Early life Nagakura Shinpachi Noriyuki, known as Eikichi or Eiji during his childhood, was born in the Matsumae clan's \\"kami-yashiki\\" (upper residence) in Edo on the 11th day of the fourth month of Tenp≈ç 10 (May 23, 1839). His father, Nagakura Kanji, was a retainer of the Matsumae clan, with a 150 koku stipend. Like Okita S≈çji, Nagakura was a true product of the Edo period ‚Äî being a son of a retainer (of a domain he had never seen), who had lived in Edo his entire life. Nagakura's father spelled the family name with the \\"naga\\" meaning \\"long\\", but Nagakura later spelled it with the \\"naga\\" meaning \\"eternity\\". At eight, Nagakura entered Okada Juusuke Toshisada's Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ dojo; at age eighteen he reached mokuroku (6th dan), and received the menkyo kaiden certification. At age nineteen he left the service of the Matsumae clan in order to travel and improve his technique. He spent some time at Yurimoto Shuuzou's Shint≈ç Munen Ryu dojo. Nagakura also spent time at Tsubouchi Shume's Shingyoto Ryu dojo, where he met Shimada Kai, the future vice-captain of the Shinsengumi 2nd unit. Around 1861, he started \\"taking his meals\\" at Kond≈ç Isami's Shieikan. R≈çshigumi In 1863 (Bunky≈´ 3), Nagakura and Kond≈ç joined the R≈çshigumi. Upon arrival in Kyoto however, the R≈çshigumi was immediately disbanded. While most of the R≈çshigumi returned to Edo, Nagakura, Kond≈ç, Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, Serizawa Kamo were among nineteen Roshigumi members stayed behind in Kyoto. Shinsengumi  The Mibu R≈çshigumi was formed by the Kyoto Shugoshoku (\\"Kyoto Protector\\") Matsudaira Higo no Kami (Katamori, of Aizu), and headed by Kond≈ç and Serizawa. After the events of the 18th day of the 8th month (September 18, 1863), the group became known as Shinsengumi. Nagakura became a fukuchou jokin (assistant vice commander) in 1863. On July 8, 1864 during the Ikedaya incident, Nagakura was one of four members which included Kond≈ç, Okita S≈çji and T≈çd≈ç Heisuke, being the first group to raid inside the Ikedaya Inn, he later suffered a deep wound on his left thumb and his sword was broken during the battle. A month later on August 20, 1864, he also involved in the Kinmon incident alongside with Kond≈ç, Okita and several others. He then became the captain of the 2nd unit in 1865. Together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, he became a hatamoto in June 1867. On December 13, 1867, Nagakura was involved with Harada Sanosuke and several other Shinsengumi members during the Aburanok≈çji incident with the ambush of It≈ç Kashitar≈ç's Gory≈ç Eji K≈çdai-ji faction, which consisted of a small group of Shinsengumi defectors. Seven of these defectors were trying to retrieve It≈ç's body, who was assassinated earlier and left at the crossroad of Aburanok≈çji-Shichij≈ç as a trap. Three of them had been assassinated during the ambush, while the remaining four fled. Nagakura had a daughter with a geisha from Shimabara Kameya in Kyoto known only by her stage name as , who died after her birth in December 1867. Due to the approaching Boshin War, Nagakura was not able to attend to her burial. Fortunately he managed to arrange for his infant daughter to be brought up by Kotsune's sister, who lived in a village of Fudoson not far from Kyoto. Assumed that he would never see his daughter again, Nagakura gave the family 50 ryo to cover the child expenses. Boshin war On January 27, 1868, in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi in Kyoto, Nagakura shown his courage by leading the members of a suicide squad and charging with a sword towards the bullet-firing imperial army. Right after the Battle of K≈çsh≈´-Katsunuma in April 1868, Nagukura and Harada Sanosuke left the K≈çy≈ç Chinbutai (the renamed Shinsengumi) after disagreements with long-time comrades Kondo and Hijikata. According to Nagakura, Kond≈ç wanted the surviving men to become his retainers; Nagakura, Harada, and a few others staunchly refused.≈åishi, p. 200 Nagakura and Harada, taking with them some other members, joined with a group of former Tokugawa retainers with Haga Gidou being one of them to form a new unit, the Seiheitai.Kikuchi, p. 228. Nagakura and the Seiheitai unit left Edo shortly after Edo Castle's surrender, and participated in some battles in the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle and at Imaichi and headed north, hoped to take part in the fighting that was moving northward, toward Aizu. But upon receiving news of the surrender of the Aizu Domain, Nagakura returned to Edo. Meiji Restoration While in Edo, he had to hide for a while because he had fought against the Imperial forces and would turned himself in to the senior councilor Shimokuni Toshichiro of the Matsumae clan and served as an infantry instructor and was stipended at his father's original rate of 150 koku. However, he would often run into Suzuki Mikisabur≈ç, the younger brother of deceased It≈ç Kashitar≈ç and one of the four Shinsengumi defectors who narrowly escaped from the assassination attempt during the Aburanok≈çji incident back then in December 1867. Due to his involvement in that incident and suspecting that Suzuki was trying to kill him, Nagakura returned to Matsumae, Hokkaido in late 1868 (Meiji 1). In 1871 (Meiji 4), Nagakura married , daughter of the physician (). In 1873 (Meiji 6), he was adopted into his wife's family and changed his name first to , and later . Their only son, was born on February 24, 1873. Later in 1875, Sugimura Yoshie, with the help of the physician Matsumoto Ry≈çjun and several surviving former Shinsengumi comrades including Sait≈ç Hajime (as Fujita Gor≈ç) among others, erected the monument known as the Grave of Shinsengumi for Kond≈ç Isami, Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, and the fallen comrades of the Shinsengumi at Jutoku-ji temple boundary in Itabashi, Tokyo and held requiems for their past comrades' souls. In 1882 (Meiji 15), Sugimura moved his family to Otaru, Hokkaido, and was invited by the police bureaucrat Tsukigata Kiyoshi to work as kenjutsu teacher to train the prison guards in Kabato prison for four years. Following his retirement in 1886 (Meiji 19), he opened a dojo to teach kendo at Asakusa, Tait≈ç, Tokyo. Sugimura later moved back to Otaru in 1889 (Meiji 22) when his wife and son opened a pharmacy there. In 1900 (Meiji 33), Sugimura was on his way to attend the funeral of his former Shinsengumi comrade Shimada Kai in Kyoto, he was reunited with his daughter Isoko there, who had become a well-known geisha actress of the Kansai region under the stage name . Following their reunion, Sugimura and Isoko never met again. Isoko was later adopted into the Okada family and took the name of . In 1905 (Meiji 38), Sugimura moved again and lived at Midori 1-chome near the Otaru Juvenile Science Museum. Sugimura's geisha daughter died on December 21, 1905 at the age of 39. In late July 1909 (Meiji 42), he moved again to Hanazono, Otaru, where he taught kendo at the club of the Tohoku Imperial University's Faculty of Agricultural (present day location of Hokkaido University). In 1911 (Meiji 44), he gave an oral background of the Shinsengumi to a journalist for a newspaper. It is believed that since the reports were given half a century after the events, the accounts were more for pleasing crowds than a faithful record. Sugimura did however, write his memoirs that can testify first hand to the bloody lifetime of the Shinsengumi. He had lent his written memoirs to an acquaintance long before his newspaper interview, but the memoirs were never returned to him. Sugimura Yoshie's memoirs were lost for decades before being found in 1998 and was published in book form. Death Sugimura Yoshie died of periostitis caused by caries and sepsis on January 5, 1915 (Taisho 4). He was seventy-six. His last words was \\"\\". Upon his will, he was buried at the Grave of Shinsengumi, Itabashi, Tokyo. Coincidentally, in this same year, Fujita Gor≈ç, another former Shinsengumi captain who was formerly Sait≈ç Hajime, died at the age of seventy-two from a stomach ulcer on September 28. Notable work * Shinsengumi Tenmatsuki (1998) Nagakura in Fiction Accounts of Nagakura's time before and during his Shinsengumi period appear in novels, period dramas and anime/manga series.

It provides a cross-platform environment for the writing and testing of Haskell code and it supports numerous extensions, libraries, and optimisations that streamline the process of generating and executing code. GHC is the most commonly used Haskell compiler. The lead developers are Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow. History GHC originally started in 1989 as a prototype, written in LML (Lazy ML) by Kevin Hammond at the University of Glasgow. Later that year, the prototype was completely rewritten in Haskell, except for its parser, by Cordelia Hall, Will Partain, and Simon Peyton Jones. Its first beta release was on 1 April 1991 and subsequent releases added a strictness analyzer as well as language extensions such as monadic I/O, mutable arrays, unboxed data types, concurrent and parallel programming models (such as software transactional memory and data parallelism) and a profiler. Peyton Jones, as well as Marlow, later moved to Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England, where they continued to be primarily responsible for developing GHC. GHC also contains code from more than three hundred other contributors. Since 2009, third-party contributions to GHC have been funded by the Industrial Haskell Group. Architecture GHC itself is written in Haskell, but the runtime system for Haskell, essential to run programs, is written in C and C. GHC's front end‚Äîincorporating the lexer, parser and typechecker‚Äîis designed to preserve as much information about the source language as possible until after type inference is complete, toward the goal of providing clear error messages to users. After type checking, the Haskell code is desugared into a typed intermediate language known as \\"Core\\" (based on System F, extended with \`let\` and \`case\` expressions). Recently, Core was extended to support generalized algebraic datatypes in its type system, and is now based on an extension to System F known as System FC. In the tradition of type-directed compilation, GHC's simplifier, or \\"middle end\\", where most of the optimizations implemented in GHC are performed, is structured as a series of source-to-source transformations on Core code. The analyses and transformations performed in this compiler stage include demand analysis (a generalization of strictness analysis), application of user-defined rewrite rules (including a set of rules included in GHC's standard libraries that performs foldr/build fusion), unfolding (called \\"inlining\\" in more traditional compilers), let-floating, an analysis that determines which function arguments can be unboxed, constructed product result analysis, specialization of overloaded functions, as well as a set of simpler local transformations such as constant folding and beta reduction. The back end of the compiler transforms Core code into an internal representation of C, via an intermediate language STG (short for \\"Spineless Tagless G-machine\\"). The C code can then take one of three routes: it is either printed as C code for compilation with GCC, converted directly into native machine code (the traditional \\"code generation\\" phase), or converted to LLVM virtual machine code for compilation with LLVM. In all three cases, the resultant native code is finally linked against the GHC runtime system to produce an executable. Language GHC complies with the language standards, both Haskell 98 and Haskell 2010. It also supports many optional extensions to the Haskell standard: for example, the software transactional memory (STM) library, which allows for Composable Memory Transactions. Extensions to Haskell A number of extensions to Haskell have been proposed. These extensions provide features not described in the language specification, or they redefine existing constructs. As such, each extension may not be supported by all Haskell implementations. There is an ongoing effort to describe extensions and select those which will be included in future versions of the language specification. The extensions supported by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler include: * Unboxed types and operations. These represent the primitive datatypes of the underlying hardware, without the indirection of a pointer to the heap or the possibility of deferred evaluation. Numerically intensive code can be significantly faster when coded using these types. * The ability to specify strict evaluation for a value, pattern binding, or datatype field. * More convenient syntax for working with modules, patterns, list comprehensions, operators, records, and tuples. * Syntactic sugar for computing with arrows and recursively-defined monadic values. Both of these concepts extend the monadic -notation provided in standard Haskell. * A significantly more powerful system of types and typeclasses, described below. * Template Haskell, a system for compile-time metaprogramming. A programmer can write expressions that produce Haskell code in the form of an abstract syntax tree. These expressions are typechecked and evaluated at compile time; the generated code is then included as if it were written directly by the programmer. Together with the ability to reflect on definitions, this provides a powerful tool for further extensions to the language. * Quasi-quotation, which allows the user to define new concrete syntax for expressions and patterns. Quasi-quotation is useful when a metaprogram written in Haskell manipulates code written in a language other than Haskell. * Generic typeclasses, which specify functions solely in terms of the algebraic structure of the types they operate on. * Parallel evaluation of expressions using multiple CPU cores. This does not require explicitly spawning threads. The distribution of work happens implicitly, based on annotations provided by the programmer. * Compiler pragmas for directing optimizations such as inline expansion and specializing functions for particular types. * Customizable rewrite rules. The programmer can provide rules describing how to replace one expression with an equivalent but more efficiently evaluated expression. These are used within core datastructure libraries to provide improved performance throughout application-level code. * Record dot syntax. Provides syntactic sugar for accessing the fields of a (potentially nested) record which is similar to the syntax of many other programming languages. Type system extensions An expressive static type system is one of the major defining features of Haskell. Accordingly, much of the work in extending the language has been directed towards types and type classes. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler supports an extended type system based on the theoretical System FC. Major extensions to the type system include: * Arbitrary-rank and impredicative polymorphism. Essentially, a polymorphic function or datatype constructor may require that one of its arguments is itself polymorphic. * Generalized algebraic data types. Each constructor of a polymorphic datatype can encode information into the resulting type. A function which pattern-matches on this type can use the per-constructor type information to perform more specific operations on data. * Existential types. These can be used to \\"bundle\\" some data together with operations on that data, in such a way that the operations can be used without exposing the specific type of the underlying data. Such a value is very similar to an object as found in object-oriented programming languages. * Data types that do not actually contain any values. These can be useful to represent data in type-level metaprogramming. * Type families: user- defined functions from types to types. Whereas parametric polymorphism provides the same structure for every type instantiation, type families provide ad hoc polymorphism with implementations that can differ between instantiations. Use cases include content-aware optimizing containers and type-level metaprogramming. * Implicit function parameters that have dynamic scope. These are represented in types in much the same way as type class constraints. * Linear types (GHC 9.0) Extensions relating to type classes include: * A type class may be parametrized on more than one type. Thus a type class can describe not only a set of types, but an n-ary relation on types. * Functional dependencies, which constrain parts of that relation to be a mathematical function on types. That is, the constraint specifies that some type class parameter is completely determined once some other set of parameters is fixed. This guides the process of type inference in situations where otherwise there would be ambiguity. * Significantly relaxed rules regarding the allowable shape of type class instances. When these are enabled in full, the type class system becomes a Turing-complete language for logic programming at compile time. * Type families, as described above, may also be associated with a type class. * The automatic generation of certain type class instances is extended in several ways. New type classes for generic programming and common recursion patterns are supported. Additionally, when a new type is declared as isomorphic to an existing type, any type class instance declared for the underlying type may be lifted to the new type \\"for free\\". Portability Versions of GHC are available for several platforms, including Windows and most varieties of Unix (such as Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS).Platforms at gitlab.haskell.org GHC has also been ported to several different processor architectures.

Higher-order logics with their standard semantics are more expressive, but their model-theoretic properties are less well-behaved than those of first-order logic. The term \\"higher-order logic\\", abbreviated as HOL, is commonly used to mean higher-order simple predicate logic. Here \\"simple\\" indicates that the underlying type theory is the theory of simple types, also called the simple theory of types (see Type theory). Leon Chwistek and Frank P. Ramsey proposed this as a simplification of the complicated and clumsy ramified theory of types specified in the Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Simple types is nowadays sometimes also meant to exclude polymorphic and dependent types.Jacobs, 1999, chapter 5  Quantification scope  First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals; second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over sets; third-order logic also quantifies over sets of sets, and so on. Higher-order logic is the union of first-, second-, third-, ‚Ä¶, nth-order logic; i.e., higher-order logic admits quantification over sets that are nested arbitrarily deeply.  Semantics  There are two possible semantics for higher order logic. In the standard or full semantics, quantifiers over higher-type objects range over all possible objects of that type. For example, a quantifier over sets of individuals ranges over the entire powerset of the set of individuals. Thus, in standard semantics, once the set of individuals is specified, this is enough to specify all the quantifiers. HOL with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, HOL admits categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers, and of the real numbers, which are impossible with first-order logic. However, by a result of Kurt G√∂del, HOL with standard semantics does not admit an effective, sound, and complete proof calculus.Shapiro 1991, p. 87. The model-theoretic properties of HOL with standard semantics are also more complex than those of first-order logic. For example, the L√∂wenheim number of second-order logic is already larger than the first measurable cardinal, if such a cardinal exists.Menachem Magidor and Jouko V√§√§n√§nen. \\"On L√∂wenheim- Skolem-Tarski numbers for extensions of first order logic\\", Report No. 15 (2009/2010) of the Mittag-Leffler Institute. The L√∂wenheim number of first- order logic, in contrast, is ‚Ñµ0, the smallest infinite cardinal. In Henkin semantics, a separate domain is included in each interpretation for each higher-order type. Thus, for example, quantifiers over sets of individuals may range over only a subset of the powerset of the set of individuals. HOL with these semantics is equivalent to many-sorted first-order logic, rather than being stronger than first-order logic. In particular, HOL with Henkin semantics has all the model-theoretic properties of first-order logic, and has a complete, sound, effective proof system inherited from first-order logic.  Examples and properties  Higher order logics include the offshoots of Church's Simple theory of typesAlonzo Church, A formulation of the simple theory of types, The Journal of Symbolic Logic 5(2):56-68 (1940) and the various forms of intuitionistic type theory. G√©rard Huet has shown that unifiability is undecidable in a type theoretic flavor of third-order logic, that is, there can be no algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary equation between third-order (let alone arbitrary higher-order) terms has a solution. Up to a certain notion of isomorphism, the powerset operation is definable in second-order logic. Using this observation, Jaakko Hintikka established in 1955 that second-order logic can simulate higher-order logics in the sense that for every formula of a higher order-logic one can find an equisatisfiable formula for it in second-order logic.entry on HOL The term \\"higher-order logic\\" is assumed in some context to refer to classical higher-order logic. However, modal higher-order logic has been studied as well. According to several logicians, G√∂del's ontological proof is best studied (from a technical perspective) in such a context.

Early life and education Born to Croatian immigrant parents, his original surname was Grgurinovic. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, he served in the United States Navy during World War II. To make his last name easier to pronounce during military roll calls, he officially changed it to \\"Grinich\\". Grinich received a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1946 and a master's degree in 1949, and then earned a Ph.D. in 1951 from Stanford University. Career Initially a researcher at SRI International, he worked at the seminal Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory of Beckman Instruments, and then left with other disgruntled members of the \\"traitorous eight\\" to create the influential Fairchild Semiconductor corporation. Among the physicists, mathematicians and metallurgists in the group, Grinich was the only electrical engineer. At Fairchild he set up the test lab and other electronic systems where he was responsible for device characterization and applications. His department grew into the important Fairchild Instrumentation business. Grinich left Fairchild in 1968 to study computer science while teaching electrical engineering at UC Berkeley. He later taught at Stanford University as well. In 1975, he published a textbook, Introduction to Integrated Circuits. In 1978, he was appointed chief executive officer of Identronix, a company that pioneered Radio-frequency identification systems, which are now used extensively in anti-theft tags. In 1985, Grinich founded and became CEO of Escort Memory Systems to commercialize RFID tags for industrial applications. EMS was acquired by Datalogic in 1989. In 1993, he co-founded Arkos Design, a manufacturer of emulators. The company was acquired by Synopsys in 1995. Grinich retired in 1997 and died of prostate cancer in 2000, three weeks before his 76th birthday.

It is occasionally secreted by cancer cells (breast cancer, certain types of lung cancer including squamous-cell lung carcinoma). However, it also has normal functions in bone, tooth, vascular and other tissues.  Function  PTHrP acts as an endocrine, autocrine, paracrine, and intracrine hormone. It regulates endochondral bone development by maintaining the endochondral growth plate at a constant width. It also regulates epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal interactions during the formation of the mammary glands.  Tooth eruption  PTHrP is critical in intraosseous phase of tooth eruption where it acts as a signalling molecule to stimulate local bone resorption. Without PTHrP, the bony crypt surrounding the tooth follicle will not resorb, and therefore the tooth will not erupt. In the context of tooth eruption, PTHrP is secreted by the cells of the reduced enamel epithelium.  Mammary glands  It aids in normal mammary gland development. It is necessary for maintenance of the mammary bud. Loss of PTHrP or its receptor causes the mammary bud cell fate to change back into epidermis. In lactation, it may regulate in conjunction with the calcium sensing receptor the mobilization and transfer of calcium to the milk, as well as placental transfer of calcium.  Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy  PTHrP is related in function to the \\"normal\\" parathyroid hormone. When a tumor secretes PTHrP, this can lead to hypercalcemia. As this is sometimes the first sign of the malignancy, hypercalcemia caused by PTHrP is considered a paraneoplastic phenomenon. PTHR1 is responsible for most cases of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. PTHrP shares the same N-terminal end as parathyroid hormone and therefore it can bind to the same receptor, the Type I PTH receptor (PTHR1). PTHrP can simulate most of the actions of PTH including increases in bone resorption and distal tubular calcium reabsorption, and inhibition of proximal tubular phosphate transport. PTHrP lacks the normal feedback inhibition as PTH. However, PTHrP is less likely than PTH to stimulate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. Therefore, PTHrP does not increase intestinal calcium absorption.  Genetics  Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been observed. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from non-AUG (CUG and GUG) start sites, in-frame and downstream of the initiator AUG codon, to give rise to nuclear forms of this hormone.  Discovery  The protein was first isolated in 1987 by T. J. Martin's team at the University of Melbourne. Miao et al. showed that disruption of the PTHrP gene in mice caused a lethal phenotype and distinct bone abnormalities, suggesting that PTHrP has a physiological function.  Interactions  Parathyroid hormone-related protein has been shown to interact with KPNB1 and Arrestin beta 1.

The character's first published appearance is in Star Spangled Comics #122 (November 1951). Publication history Dr. Thirteen, also known as Dr. Thirteen the Ghost Breaker, debuted in his own feature in Star Spangled Comics, from issue #122‚Äì130 (Nov. 1951 ‚Äì July 1952). The feature then moved to House of Mystery and was canceled after issue #7.Paul Levitz, The Golden Age of DC Comics Taschen, 2012, pp. 374‚Äì375. The character was created by an unknown writer with artist Leonard Star.Doctor Thirteen at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 4, 2016. The character next appeared in Showcase #80 in 1969 as a supporting character in the Phantom Stranger story and then as a regular character in the Phantom Stranger series that began later that year. Early issues featured a few new pages of story and art that framed reprints of the two characters' old stories. The feature was temporarily replaced by The Spawn of Frankenstein in Phantom Stranger #23‚Äì30, in which Dr. Thirteen appeared, blaming Frankenstein's monster for putting his wife, Maria, in a coma. He made one further appearance in issue #36, replacing the Black Orchid serial that had replaced The Spawn of Frankenstein. He also had a serial in Ghosts #95‚Äì99 and #101-102. In three of these issues, he confronted the Spectre. He also appeared in House of Secrets #150 alongside his longtime rival, the Phantom Stranger. Dr. Thirteen also appeared in Batman #341‚Äì342 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1981) to research a mystery in the abandoned Wayne Manor involving the Man-Bat. He reappeared in Gotham City in Batman #354 (Dec. 1982) to reluctantly aid Rupert Thorne, who believed that he was being haunted by the ghost of Hugo Strange. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis Dr. Thirteen is a parapsychologist who investigates reports of possible supernatural activity with the goal of proving them to be hoaxes. Dr. Thirteen's stories are set in the DC Universe, where many stories involving the supernatural also are set. He was usually accompanied by his wife, Maria, sometimes called Marie. In his origin story, as presented in Showcase #80, Terrence's [sic‚Äîthe spelling varied, but it was spelled with an e in the first story] father tries to hide his ancestry from him, but eventually went into a locked room, showing his son the history of his ancestors, many of whom were executed for practicing magic, such as Daniel, who was killed by the ancient Romans for diagramming the solar system, and Rebecca, who was executed during the Salem witch trials, when she was actually developing anesthesia. Terry and his unnamed father enter into a pact to prove that the supernatural is false by determining things that Mr. Thirteen will say to Terry by the grandfather clock on the one-year anniversary of his death. Mr. Thirteen is then killed in a road accident three months later. On the first anniversary of his father's death, Terry asks the questions and gets no response, then remembers that he was supposed to set the clock before asking the questions. At this point, he hears the correct responses to the questions. He discovers that these responses are on a gramophone record that was planted by his fianc√©e, Marie, who also had a pact with Mr. Thirteen to show Terry that anything that appears to be supernatural has a rational explanation. Post-Crisis In the limited series The Books of Magic, John Constantine explains to Timothy Hunter that because Dr. Thirteen does not believe, magic and the supernatural truly do not work for him.The Books of Magic #2 Vertigo Visions In the Vertigo Comics one- shot Vertigo Visions: Doctor 13 ‚Äì Do AIs Dream of Electric Sheep?, Dr. Terrence Thirteen and his wife Marie go to marriage counseling, as Marie is becoming increasingly alienated from Terrence due to his overbearing behavior and the fact that he refuses to take payment for his services and therefore lives off her bank account. Dr. Thirteen becomes trapped in a virtual reality and embroiled in a conflict between benign and malicious artificial intelligences with the ability to manipulate media and sensory perceptions on a global scale. At the conclusion of the comic, Dr. Thirteen is seen in a mental institution, having apparently suffered a mental breakdown during the visit to the marriage counselor and hallucinated everything, although the AIs are also seen to be real.Vertigo Visions: Doctor 13 ‚Äì Do AIs Dream of Electric Sheep? (September 1998) Seven Soldiers of Victory In the first issue of Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers: Zatanna miniseries, Dr. Thirteen is said to have been dating the title character, believing her to be just a very talented stage magician. After she attends his book signing, he agrees to go with her to obtain proof that magic is real. Joined by Ibis the Invincible, his wife Taia, and Swamp Thing supporting character Timothy Ravenwind, the group journey to many mystical realms. The purpose is to hunt for an approaching magical threat. Thirteen and the other three mystics are skeletonized by an entity called Gwdion. Zatanna blames her lack of preparation for the mystical journey, along with her addiction to using magic for selfish purposes.Zatanna #1 (April 2005) Tales of the Unexpected In the eight-issue miniseries Tales of the Unexpected published in 2006, Dr. Thirteen unites with other characters from cancelled series, including Genius Jones, Andrew Bennett, Anthro, the Primate Patrol,first appearance Weird War Tales #89 (July 1980) Infectious Lass from the Legion of Substitute-Heroes, Captain Fearfirst appearance Adventure Comics #425 (December/January 1972) from a 1970s feature within the pages of Adventure Comics, and the Haunted Tank, in a story that repeatedly breaks the fourth wall and comments on the then-current state of DC Comics and its continuity. Dr. Thirteen's group fights the Architects, the four writers who were heavily involved in the direction of the DC Universe titles at the time ‚Äî Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka and Mark Waid ‚Äî to convince them to include them in the new Universe.

She becomes badly injured from an Amazon spear. This snaps Dr. Thirteen out of his rampage. The two reconcile and Dr. Thirteen uses his remaining magic to stop the satellite, less than two minutes before it attacks. Traci then saves him, and it is revealed they have both used up all of their magic.Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint #3 (August 2011) The New 52 Following the events of Flashpoint, Dr. Thirteen appeared in a two-part backup story in All-Star Western #11-12. In this rebooted version, he lives in 1880s Gotham City, where he is enlisted by the police to hunt down a paranormal highwayman.All-Star Western #11-12 (September-October 2012). Dr. Thirteen's descendant (also named Dr. Terrence Thirteen) later appears in Phantom Stranger #2, enlisting the aid of the Phantom Stranger to repel the Haunted Highwayman in the present time. Other versions Grant Morrison, in Doom Patrol (vol. 2) #54 substituted him in Danny the Street's dreams with Doctor Occult in a superhero version of The Trenchcoat Brigade in which Constantine uses \\"Hellblazer\\" as a superhero name. That version of the character was \\"the Multiple Man\\" rather than the Ghost-Breaker, of which his Dr. 8 identity was second most important to the story.

History  Abd√ºlmecid I Facade of the Selamlƒ±k Dolmabah√ße Palace was ordered by the Empire's 31st Sultan, Abd√ºlmecid I, and built between the years 1843 and 1856. Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the Topkapƒ± Palace, but as the medieval Topkapƒ± was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abd√ºlmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Be≈üikta≈ü Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hacƒ± Said Aƒüa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects Garabet Balyan, his son Nigoƒüayos Balyan and Evanis Kalfa (members of the Armenian Balyan family of Ottoman court architects). The construction cost five million Ottoman gold lira, or 35 tonnes of gold, the equivalent of ca. $1.5 billion in today's (2013) values.Dolmabahce PalaceGoldgrambars.com This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through debasement, by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually defaulted on its public debt in October 1875, with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of financial control over the \\"sick man of Europe\\" by the European powers. The palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph Abd√ºlmecid Efendi. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924 transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atat√ºrk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938. Today, the palace is managed by Milli Saraylar Daire Ba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.  Location  Close-up view of the palace from the Bosphorus The site of Dolmabah√ße was originally a bay on the Bosphorus which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman sultans; it is from this garden that the name Dolmabah√ße (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish dolma meaning \\"filled\\" and bah√ße meaning \\"garden.\\" Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Be≈üikta≈ü Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000 m¬≤ is confined by Bosphorus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000 m¬≤ monoblock Dolmabah√ße Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.Dolmabah√ße Palace Museum Turkish Ministry of Tourism site about Dolmabah√ße Palace  Design and layout  Floor plan of the palace Dolmabah√ße is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of , and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (hamam) and 68 toilets. The design contains eclectic elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and d√©cor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on Ottoman culture and art during the Tanzimat period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big avant-corps with two side avant-corps. Functionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (Mabeyn-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, or Selamlƒ±k, the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (Harem-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, the Harem) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (Muayede Salonu) with a floor area of and a high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.  D√©cor and equipment  Ceremonial Hall, with the chandelier said to have been given by Queen Victoria Crystal Staircase with Baccarat crystal banisters and chandelier Blue Hall Sultan's hamam decorated with Egyptian alabaster Whereas the Topkapƒ± has exquisite examples of Iznik tiles and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabah√ße palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings.Dolmabah√ße Palace, Emporis The world's largest Bohemian crystal chandelier is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier was assumed to be a gift from Queen Victoria, however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabah√ße has the largest collection of Bohemian and Baccarat crystal chandeliers in the world. The famous Crystal Staircase has the shape of a double horseshoe and is built of Baccarat crystal, brass and mahogany. Expensive stones such as Marmara (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian alabaster (calcite, also known as onyx-marble), and Porphyry from Pergamon were used for the decoration. The palace includes a large number of Hereke palace carpets made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by Tsar Nicholas I. A collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul.Historical Ottoman Palace reopens as museum, EuroAsiaNews.com, March 22, 2014 The collection also includes paintings by Gustave Boulanger, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Eug√®ne Fromentin, Stanis≈Çaw Chlebowski, F√©lix Ziem, Karl Joseph Kuwasseg, Fausto Zonaro, Th√©o van Rysselberghe and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as Osman Hamdi Bey, Halil Pasha and Osman Nuri Pasha in this art museum. From the very beginning, the palace's equipment implemented the highest technical standards. Gas lighting and water- closets were imported from Great Britain, whereas the palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a central heating system and an elevator were installed.  Rooms  Blue Hall Pink Hall  Medhal (Main Entrance) Hall  A visit to the Dolmabahce Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading Ottoman officials, the Grand Vizier and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, ≈ûeyh√ºlislam, and members of the House of Representatives (Meclis-i Mebusan) and the Senate (Meclis-i Ayan). Guests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the monogram of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.  The secretariat's rooms  The second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk's Hall, also referred to as the Tiled Room. The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by Stefano Ussi, hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the Kaaba and to provide financial assistance to the local population of Hejaz. Atat√ºrk's deathbed On the wall to the right is a painting signed by Rudolf Ernst depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by Delandre. Decorated with French style furniture, this room also contains very valuable porcelain vases.  Atat√ºrk's room  Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk spent the last days of his life in the palace as his health deteriorated. He died at 9:05 A.M. on November 10, 1938, in a bedroom located in the former harem area of the palace. All the clocks in the palace were stopped and set to 9:05 after his death. The clocks outside of his room now are set to the actual time in Turkey, but the clock in the room in which he died still points to 9:05.

Further buildings include imperial kitchens (Matbah-i Amire), stables, an aviary (Kusluk), a plant nursery (Fidelik), a flour mill, a greenhouse (Sera), a Hereke carpet workshop (Hereke d√∂k√ºmhanesi), a glass manufactory, a foundry, a pharmacy etc.Dolmabah√ße Palace, Great IstanbulDolmabah√ße Sarayi, Archnet A baroque style mosque designed by Garabet Balyan was built near the palace in 1853‚Äî1855. It was commissioned by queen mother Bezm-i √Çlem Valide Sultan. Since 1948 the building housed the Naval Museum, but the museum was moved to another location in 1960 after the coup d'√©tat of May, 27th. In 1967 the mosque was returned for worship. A clock tower (Dolmabah√ße Saat Kulesi) was erected in front of the Imperial Gate (Saltanat Kapisi) on a square along the European waterfront of Bosphorus next to the mosque. The tower was ordered by Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II and designed by the court architect Sarkis Balyan between 1890 and 1895.

Written by Robert Morris while at Bell Labs, it is one of the oldest Unix utilities, preceding even the invention of the C programming language. Like other utilities of that vintage, it has a powerful set of features but terse syntax. Traditionally, the bc calculator program (with infix notation) was implemented on top of dc. This article provides some examples in an attempt to give a general flavour of the language; for a complete list of commands and syntax, one should consult the man page for one's specific implementation. History dc is the oldest surviving Unix language. When its home Bell Labs received a PDP-11, dcwritten in Bwas the first language to run on the new computer, even before an assembler. Ken Thompson has opined that dc was the very first program written on the machine. Basic operations To multiply four and five in dc (note that most of the whitespace is optional): $ cat > cal.txt 4 5 * p ^d $ dc cal.txt 20 $ You can also get the result with the commands: $ echo \\"4 5 * p\\" dc or $ dc - 4 5*pq 20 $ dc 4 5 * p 20 q $ dc -e '4 5 * p' This translates into \\"push four and five onto the stack, then, with the multiplication operator, pop two elements from the stack, multiply them and push the result back on the stack.\\" Then the \`p\` command is used to examine (print out to the screen) the top element on the stack. The \`q\` command quits the invoked instance of dc. Note that numbers must be spaced from each other even as some operators need not be. The arithmetic precision is changed with the command \`k\`, which sets the number of fractional digits (the number of digits following the point) to be used for arithmetic operations. Since the default precision is zero, this sequence of commands produces \`0\` as a result: 2 3 / p By adjusting the precision with \`k\`, arbitrary number of decimal places can be produced. This command sequence outputs \`.66666\`. 5 k 2 3 / p To evaluate \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(12 + \\\\left(-3\\\\right)^4\\\\right)\\\\over11}-22: (\`v\` computes the square root of the top of the stack and \`_\` is used to input a negative number): 12 _3 4 ^ + 11 / v 22 - p To swap the top two elements of the stack, use the \`r\` command. To duplicate the top element, use the \`d\` command. Input/output To read a line from stdin, use the \`?\` command. This will evaluate the line as if it were a dc command, and so it is necessary that it be syntactically correct and potentially be a security problem since the \`!\` dc command will allow arbitrary command execution. As mentioned above, \`p\` will print the top of the stack with a newline after it. \`n\` will pop the top of the stack and output it without a trailing newline. \`f\` will dump the entire stack with one entry per line. dc also supports arbitrary input and output radices. The \`i\` command will pop the top of the stack and use it for the input base. Hex digits must be in upper case to avoid collisions with dc commands and are not limited to A-F if the input radix is larger than 16. The \`o\` command does the same for the output base, but keep in mind that the input base will affect the parsing of every numeric value afterwards so it is usually advisable to set the output base first. To read the values, the \`K\`, \`I\` and \`O\` commands will push the current precision, input radix and output radix on to the top of the stack. As an example, to convert from hex to binary: $ echo 16i2o DEADBEEFp dc 11011110101011011011111011101111 Language features Registers In addition to these basic arithmetic and stack operations, dc includes support for macros, conditionals and storing of results for later retrieval. The mechanism underlying macros and conditionals is the register, which in dc is a storage location with a single character name which can be stored to and retrieved from: \`sc\` pops the top of the stack and stores it in register c, and \`lc\` pushes the value of register c onto the stack. For example: 3 sc 4 lc * p Registers can also be treated as secondary stacks, so values can be pushed and popped between them and the main stack using the \`S\` and \`L\` commands. Strings String values are enclosed in \`[\` and \`]\` characters and may be pushed on the stack and stored in registers. The \`a\` command will convert the low order byte of the numeric value into an ASCII character, or if the top of the stack is a string it will replace it with the first character of the string. There are no ways to build up strings or perform string manipulation other than executing it with the \`x\` command, or printing it with the \`P\` command. The \`#\` character begins a comment to the end of the line. Macros Macros are then implemented by allowing registers and stack entries to be strings as well as numbers. A string can be printed, but it can also be executed (i.e. processed as a sequence of dc commands). So for instance we can store a macro to add one and then multiply by 2 into register m: [1 + 2 *] sm and then (using the \`x\` command which executes the top of the stack) we can use it like this: 3 lm x p Conditionals Finally, we can use this macro mechanism to provide conditionals. The command \`=r\` will pop two values from the stack, and execute the macro stored in register \`r\` only if they are equal. So this will print the string \`equal\` only if the top of the stack is equal to 5: equal]p] sm 5 =m Other conditionals are \`>\`, \`!>\`, \`<\`, \`!<\`, \`!=\`, which will execute the specified macro if the top two values on the stack are greater, less than or equal to (\\"not greater\\"), less than, greater than or equal to (\\"not less than\\"), and not equals, respectively. Loops Looping is then possible by defining a macro which (conditionally) reinvokes itself. A simple factorial of the top of the stack might be implemented as: # F(x): return x! # if x-1 > 1 # return x * F(x-1) # otherwise # return x [d1-d1 The 1Q command will exit from a macro, allowing an early return. q will quit from two levels of macros (and dc itself if there are less than two levels on the call stack). z will push the current stack depth before the z operation. Examples Summing the entire stack This is implemented with a macro stored in register a which conditionally calls itself, performing an addition each time, until only one value remains on the stack. The z operator is used to push the number of entries in the stack onto the stack. The comparison operator > pops two values off the stack in making the comparison. dc -e \\"1 2 4 8 16 100 0d[+2z>a]salaxp\\" And the result is 131. Summing all dc expressions as lines from file A bare number is a valid dc expression, so this can be used to sum a file where each line contains a single number. This is again implemented with a macro stored in register a which conditionally calls itself, performing an addition each time, until only one value remains on the stack. cat file dc -e \\"0d[?+2z>a]salaxp\\" The ? operator reads another command from the input stream. If the input line contains a decimal number, that value is added to the stack. When the input file reaches end of file, the command is null, and no value is added to the stack. { echo \\"5\\"; echo \\"7\\"; } dc -e \\"0d[?+2z>a]salaxp\\" And the result is 12. The input lines can also be complex dc commands. { echo \\"3 5 *\\"; echo \\"4 3 *\\"; echo \\"5dd++\\" } dc -e \\"0d[?+2z>a]salaxp\\" And the result is 42. Note that since dc supports arbitrary precision, there is no concern about numeric overflow or loss of precision, no matter how many lines the input stream contains, unlike a similarly concise solution in AWK. Downsides of this solution are: the loop will cease on encountering a blank line in the input stream (technically, any input line which does not add at least one numeric value to the stack); and, for handling negative numbers, leading instances of '-' to denote a negative sign must be change to '_' in the input stream, because of dc's nonstandard negative sign. The ? operator in dc does not provide a clean way to discern reading a blank line from reading end of file. Unit conversion As an example of a relatively simple program in dc, this command (in 1 line): dc -e ' Enter a number (metres), or 0 to exit]psj]sh[q]sz[lhx?d0=z10k39.370079*.5+0k12~1/rn[ feet ]Pn[ inches]P10Pdx]dx' will convert distances from metres to feet and inches; the bulk of it is concerned with prompting for input, printing output in a suitable format and looping round to convert another number. Greatest common divisor As an example, here is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD: dc -e '??[dSarLa%d0 Factorial Computing the factorial of an input value, n! = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n i dc -e '?[q]sQ[d1=Qd1-lFx*]dsFxp' Quines in dc There exit also quines in the progamming language dc, programs that produce its source code as output. dc -e '[91Pn[dx]93Pn]dx' dc -e '[91PP93P[dx]P]dx' Printing all prime numbers echo '2p3p[dl!d2+s!%0=@l!l^!<#]s#[s/0ds^]s@[p]s&[ddvs^3s!l#x0<&2+l.x]ds.x' dc This program was written by Michel Charpentier. It outputs the sequence of prime numbers. Note that it can be shortened by one symbol, which seems to be the minimal solution. echo '2p3p[dl!d2+s!%0=@l!l^!<#]s#[0*ds^]s@[p]s&[ddvs^3s!l#x0<&2+l.x]ds.x' dc Integer factorization dc -e '[n=]P?[p]s2[lip/dli%0=1dvsr]s12sid2%0=13sidvsr[dli%0=1lrli2+dsi!>.]ds.xd1<2' This program was also written by Michel Charpentier. There is a shorter dc -e \\"[n=]P?[lfp/dlf%0=Fdvsr]sF[dsf]sJdvsr2sf[dlf%0=Flfdd2%+1+sflr and a faster solution dc -e \\"[n=]P?[lfp/dlf% 0=Fdvsr]sFdvsr2sfd2%0=F3sfd3%0=F5sf[dlf%0=Flfd4+sflr>M]sN[dlf%0=Flfd2+sflr>N]dsMx[p]sMd1 Note that the latter can be even speeded up, if the access to a constant is replaced by a register access. dc -e \\"[n=]P?[lfp/dlf%l0=Fdvsr]sF2s2dvsr2sf4s4d2%0=F3sfd3%0=F5sf[dlf%l0=Flfdl4+sflr>M]sN[dlf%l0=Flfdl2+sflr>N]dsMx[p]sMd1 Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange A more complex example of dc use embedded in a Perl script performs a Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange. This was popular as a signature block among cypherpunks during the ITAR debates, where the short script could be run with only Perl and dc, ubiquitous programs on Unix-like operating systems: #!/usr/bin/perl  -export-a-crypto-system-sig Diffie-Hellman-2-lines ($g, $e, $m) = @ARGV, $m die \\"$0 gen exp mod \\"; print \`echo \\"16dio1[d2%Sa2/d0 A commented version is slightly easier to understand and shows how to use loops, conditionals, and the q command to return from a macro. With the GNU version of dc, the command can be used to do arbitrary precision modular exponentiation without needing to write the X function. #!/usr/bin/perl my ($g, $e, $m) = map { \\"\\\\U$_\\" } @ARGV; die \\"$0 gen exp mod \\" unless $m; print \`echo $g $e $m dc -e ' # Hex input and output 16dio # Read m, e and g from stdin on one line ?SmSeSg # Function z: return g * top of stack [lg*]sz # Function Q: remove the top of the stack and return 1 [sb1q]sQ # Function X(e): recursively compute g^e % m # It is the same as Sm^Lm%, but handles arbitrarily large exponents. # Stack at entry: e # Stack at exit: g^e % m # Since e may be very large, this uses the property that g^e % m  # if( e  0 ) # return 1 # x = (g^(e/2)) ^ 2 # if( e % 2  1 ) # x *= g # return x % [ d 0=Q # return 1 if e0 (otherwise, stack: e) d 2% Sa # Store e%2 in a (stack: e) 2/ # compute e/2 lXx # call X(e/2) d* # compute X(e/2)^2 La1=z # multiply by g if e%21 lm % # compute (g^e) % m ] SX le # Load e from the register lXx # compute g^e % m p # Print the result '\`; See also * bc (programming language) * Calculator input methods * HP calculators * Stack machine References External links * Package dc in Debian GNU/Linux repositories  Native Windows port of bc, which includes dc. * dc embedded in a webpage Category:Cross-platform software Category:Unix software Category:Software calculators Category:Free mathematics software Category:Numerical programming languages Category:Stack-oriented programming languages Category:Plan 9 commands ","title":"Dc (computer program)"},{"id":"562907","title":"Sign (semiotics)"},{"id":"562908","text":"Music Man may refer to: * The Music Man, a 1957 Broadway musical play by Meredith Willson  The Music Man (album), a 1959 jazz album by Jimmy Guiffre featuring tunes from the above musical  The Music Man (1962 film), a feature film adaptation  The Music Man (2003 film), a television film remake *\\"The Music Man\\" (song), a song and traditional game was also a 15th-century folk tale about the medicine tribes *\\"Music Man\\", song on Take a Look Around by Masta Ace *Music Man (album), a 1980 album by Waylon Jennings *Music Man (company), a guitar company *The Music Man, English name for the Iranian film Santouri * Music Man (1948 film), a 1948 American film ","title":"Music Man"},{"id":"562910","text":"GHC may refer to: Education * Georgia Highlands College, in Rome, Georgia, US * Global Health College, in Alexandria, Virginia, US * Grays Harbor College, in Aberdeen, Washington, US Organisations * Global Health Corps * Global Health Council * Group Health Cooperative * Graham Holdings Company, an American conglomerate Technology * Glasgow Haskell Compiler, a compiler for the functional programming language Haskell * Global Hybrid Cooperation, a set of vehicle technologies * Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing * Guitar Hero Carabiner, a gaming device * Guarded Horn clause, in concurrent logic programming Other uses * Great Harbour Cay Airport (IATA airport code), in the Bahamas * Hiberno-Scottish Gaelic, a language used in Ireland and Scotland from the 13th to the 18th century * Global Honored Crown, the championships in the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah See also * Ghanaian cedi (currency sign: GH‚Çµ), the currency of Ghana ","title":"GHC"},{"id":"562912","text":"Teletoon (mostly stylized as TELEToON) is a Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Teletoon Canada, Inc., a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment. Its name is a portmanteau of \\"television\\" and \\"cartoon\\". The channel primarily broadcasts various animated series, including both original and imported content, aimed at children and younger teenagers. Until 2019, the channel had also carried programming aimed at older teens and adults. Teletoon operates two timeshift feeds running on Eastern and Pacific schedules. Along with its French-language counterpart T√©l√©toon, it is available in over 7.3 million Canadian households as of November 2013. History Logo used from October 17, 1997 to February 4, 2007 In 1996, Teletoon was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)Decision CRTC 96-598 CRTC September 4, 1996 after a related application for a channel to be called \\"Fun TV\\" had been denied. The channel was launched on October 17, 1997, with the first episode of Caillou. At the time, it was known as The Animation Station with It's Unreal! as its secondary slogan, and It's Time To Twist! as its short lived slogan from 1999 to 2000, similar to how The Comedy Network did the slogan Time Well Wasted from 1997 to 2011. The latter slogan has been used during the channel's pre- launchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a_PMgix2NQ but it would not been used again until 1998. In 2000, it would become the channel's only slogan. When Teletoon was launched on October 17, 1997, it showed more mature fare as the day progressed, with a strong commitment to air diverse and international programming, and the ability to air most of the material uncut. A typical weekday broadcast day aired \\"preschool\\" content from 4:00a.m.- 3:00p.m. \\"Kids\\" (school-aged) content from 3:00p.m.- 7:00p.m. {{cite web archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971224091026/http://teletoon.com/tvguide.htm archive-date=December 24, 1997 title=TELETOON - TV Guide url=http://teletoon.com/tvguide.htm website=Teletoon.com quote=PRE-SCHOOL Mon-Fri 4:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. \\"Family\\" content from 7:00p.m.- 9:30p.m. EST, and \\"Adult\\" content from 9:30;p.m.- 4:00a.m. In 1998‚Äì1999, Teletoon started airing bumpers with its first mascot, \\"Teletina\\". These bumpers were made by Spin Productions in Toronto. Several more bumpers using CGI animation made by Guru Studio subsequently premiered on the channel. An updated look for the channel, no longer featuring the original logo, was later created for a partial rebranding in 2005. Logo used from February 5, 2007 to September 4, 2011 The older bumpers were removed in 2007 as part of an on-air rebranding. The rebrand took place on February 5, 2007; Teletoon's on-air appearance and its website were dramatically changed, the website for \\"The Detour\\" (the former name of its late-night block) was moved to teletoon.com, and the aesthetic appearance of both the normal block and \\"The Detour\\" changed. In 2008, Teletoon started using a new graphics, parodied-blocks, and figures, named Noobs, inspired by a Lego minifigure. The graphics were made using Cinema 4D. Four years later, on September 5, 2011, Teletoon's on-air branding changed again to reflect the 50th anniversary of one of its owners, Astral Media, and to reflect the transition to digital television. Since then, Teletoon has begun airing a number of live action programs in the daytime, including original series such as My Babysitter's a Vampire and Mudpit, as well as acquired programming and movies. This wasn't the first time the channel has aired live action programming; occasionally, Teletoon airs live action films related to cartoons and comic books, such as Space Jam, Sin City, and Batman. After Astral Media's stake in TELETOON Canada Inc. was purchased by Corus Entertainment, several of Teletoon's original and acquired shows, primarily live action series, began airing on YTV. In turn, Teletoon began airing anime series that aired on YTV, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, beginning with Yu- Gi-Oh! Zexal II, and Pok√©mon, beginning with XY and reruns of Pok√©mon: Advanced.https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH00277927 The debut of Zexal, in particular, marks the first time an acquired anime series aired on the channel since the debut of MegaMan NT Warrior back in 2003. Since its inception, Teletoon aired numerous television series from Cartoon Network. From September 1, 2015 to Fall 2016, original programming from the American channel was moved over to its Canadian counterpart. Around the same time, several programs airing on Teletoon Retro, which closed down on the same date, began airing on Teletoon. Teletoon would also premiere new original programming from Cartoon Network's sister channel, Boomerang. On April 1, 2019, following the relaunch of Action as Adult Swim, Teletoon's adult-oriented programs were moved to Adult Swim; with Teletoon now airing family-oriented programming full-time.First Ever 24-Hour Adult Swim Channel Coming to Canada This Spring Newswire 2019-03-04 Ownership The channel was originally owned by a consortium made up of various other 90's Canadian specialty services and producers: Family Channel acting as managing partner at 53.3% (Western International Communications and The Movie Network), YTV at 26.7%, (Shaw Communications), Cinar, and Nelvana with 10% each. Corus Entertainment was spun off from Shaw Communications (who originally owned a stake in Teletoon through YTV) in 1999. In 2000, Corus began to slowly buy out its partners in the service. Western International Communications sold its stake in the service, along with Family, to Corus in 2000, but it had to sell WIC's stakes in Teletoon and Family to Astral Media the next year. Corus bought out Nelvana in 2000 and inherited its stake. Cinar was sold in 2004 to an investment consortium composed of Michael Hirsh, Toper Taylor, and Birch Hill Capital Partners, who renamed the company Cookie Jar; Cookie Jar sold its 20% stake in the service to Corus and Astral in 2006, making it a 50-50 joint venture between the two companies. On March 4, 2013, Corus Entertainment announced that they would buy Astral's stake in Teletoon and take full ownership of the channel. The purchase was in relation to Bell Media's takeover of Astral (which had earlier been rejected by the CRTC in October 2012, but was restructured to allow the sale of certain Astral Media properties in order to allow the purchase to clear regulatory hurdles).BCE to sell assets to Corus as part of Astral deal, The Globe and Mail (via Reuters and The Canadian Press), March 4, 2013. Corus's purchase was cleared by the Competition Bureau two weeks later on March 18; on December 20, 2013, the CRTC approved Corus's full ownership of Teletoon and ownership was transferred on January 1, 2014. The channel continues to be owned by Teletoon Canada, now wholly owned by Corus Entertainment under its Corus Kids division. Programming Teletoon predominantly airs animated television series and movies. Its license originally required that 90% of all programs on the channel be animated. Its French-language counterpart contains a different schedule of programs, some being French dubbed versions of shows such as South Park. Most of the time Teletoon just airs Cartoon Network shows. Occasionally, television pilots that have not to date been developed as a full TV series are shown, such as Nemesis and Bob the Slob. Original series current (2011-present) closing logo (2007‚Äì2011) At its inception in 1996, the channel had a stated goal of producing 78 half-hours of original content every year, and it has been active in commissioning programming since then. The licence granted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1996 required a gradual increase in the portion of Canadian programming on the schedule by about five percent each year starting from 40% in its first year of operation to 60% by 2002. In 1998, network management decided to focus on renewals instead of new shows‚Äîadopting a more cautious strategy than launching a significant number of new series, as it had in the prior year. By 2001, however, the station was noted as possibly being the Canadian channel with the highest spending on original production, having invested in 98 series, including 225 half-hour episodes that fall season. Years of use As a bilingual service, Teletoon/T√©l√©toon maintains two separate broadcast feeds, with a single licence for the English and French- language channels. It is one of only two Canadian specialty services with such a licence. At the original licensing hearing before the CRTC, the network's operators had stated that the two channels \\"would be similar in nature and programmed with a similar attitude towards them. But for the reasons of rights availability, for the reasons of the question of advertising to children in Qu√©bec and for the reason of dealing with the differences in the market, there might be variations in the services offered.\\" To this end, the station implemented a requirement that all original programming be delivered in both languages. By 2007, however, this condition had been relaxed to apply \\"whenever possible\\", and over the following years some original series were only shown on one of the channels. Programming blocks Current * Saturday afternoon block ‚Äì Running from 12:00 - 3:00p.m. EST, this block features action-oriented shows and anime which, as of August 2020, includes Bakugan: Armored Alliance, Pok√©mon, Power Players, Power Rangers Beast Morphers and Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS. Yearly * Camp Teletoon ‚Äì The Camp Teletoon block replaces morning programming during the summer vacation period from July to August, containing some of the channel's popular programs, and daily movies. However, in the summer of 2009, Camp Teletoon was placed on hiatus, with Laugh Riot taking its place. The block returned in the summer of 2012, now airing weekdays from 9:00a.m. - 12:00p.m. EST. * Snowed In ‚Äì This block features holiday specials. Former * Original blocks ‚Äì In 1997, Teletoon chose a different style of animation for each block. Each blocks were represented as planets: Morning Planet for Preschoolers (claymation animation; 5:00a.m. -3:00p.m. EST), Afternoon Planet for Kids (2D cel animation; 3:00p.m.- 6:00p.m.), Evening Planet for Family (collage animation; 6:00p.m. - 9:00p.m. EST) and Night Planet for Adult (papier-m√¢ch√© animation; 9:00p.m. - 5:00a.m. EST). Each block's bumpers were made by Cuppa Coffee Studios. In August 1998, all four planets were removed permanently. * Teletoon Unleashed ‚Äì Launched in 2000, Teletoon Unleashed was an adult-oriented block; co-existing with the teen-oriented block, known as \\"The Detour\\", until they merged in 2004. * Teletoon Retro ‚Äì Teletoon Retro was the branding and block for classic animated programming. It was later spun into a digital channel, which also featured several live action series. The channel launched on October 1, 2007 and closed on September 1, 2015. * Teletoon Kapow ‚Äì Launched in September 2003, Teletoon Kapow! was an action block, which featured shows such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Spider Riders, MegaMan NT Warrior, and The Batman. Teletoon Kapow! was usually shown on weekend mornings in large blocks, although it did air in smaller blocks during the weekdays. The block was removed and replaced by Spin Cycle in September 2006. * Spin Cycle ‚Äì Spin Cycle was created in September 2006 to replace the Kapow! block, airing weeknights from 7:00p.m. - 8:00p.m. EST. After a short absence in January 2007, it returned after the channel's February 5, 2007 rebrand; Spin Cycle became a 4:00p.m. -6:00p.m. EST block on Fridays only. This time, the block featured different programming every week, such as episodes of specific programming and re-airings of the premiere specials of some shows. On September 3, 2007, Spin Cycle began airing every weekday from -4:00p.m. 6:00;p.m. EST with different shows every day. Throughout the week, viewers could vote online on the Teletoon website to pick one show that would air during the Spin Cycle block. Once a month, five viewers each got to choose the shows for an entire weekday afternoon. * Laugh Riot ‚Äì The Laugh Riot block aired weekday mornings from 7:00 - 9:00pm. EST and on Saturday mornings. It aired shows such as Out of Jimmy's Head, Chowder, Jimmy Two-Shoes, Pink Panther and Pals, Skatoony, and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. * 3 Hours of Awesome ‚Äì This block aired on Monday through Thursdays and Sunday from 6:00p.m.- 9:00 p.m. EST.

Related services On November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved multiple applications from Teletoon Canada Inc. to launch six Category 2 television channels named Teletoon Action, Teletoon Adult, Teletoon Art, Teletoon Multi, Teletoon Pop and Teletoon Retro. None of the channels launched and their broadcast licenses expired on November 24, 2004. The Teletoon Retro concept would later be revived under a different license. Current T√©l√©toon T√©l√©toon is the French counterpart to Teletoon which broadcasts most of the shows from its English counterpart in French. Teletoon HD On April 18, 2012, Teletoon launched a high-definition feed called Teletoon HD, which simulcasts the East Coast standard-definition feed. The Eastern version of Teletoon HD is available through Eastlink, Cogeco Cable, Bell Satellite TV, Telus Satellite, Shaw Direct, Rogers Cable, and other providers. Telus Optik TV announced they would carry the Western version of Teletoon HD, which simulcasts the West Coast feed. Teletoon On Demand Teletoon On Demand is a video on demand channel featuring various TV series from Teletoon. Cartoon Network On November 4, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application from Teletoon Canada Inc. (then jointly co-owned by Corus Entertainment and Astral Media) to launch Teletoon Kapow!, a Category B digital cable and satellite channel devoted \\"programming from international markets, featuring the latest trends in non-violent action, adventure, superheroes, comedy and interactivity.\\" On February 2, 2012, Teletoon announced that it would launch a local Cartoon Network channel in Canada. It debuted using the Teletoon Kapow! license on July 4, 2012. As of September 1, 2015, Cartoon Network operates under the broadcast license originally granted for Teletoon Retro. Corus then had the Teletoon Kapow! license revoked on October 2, 2015. Former Teletoon Retro Teletoon Retro was a Category B digital cable and satellite channel that debuted in Fall 2007, and was named after a program block that featured classic animated series. Shows seen on the channel included The Tom and Jerry Show, The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show, Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones, The Raccoons, The Jetsons, The Pink Panther, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Inspector Gadget, and Gumby; several films also aired on it. The channel was discontinued on September 1, 2015, with Disney Channel Canada (on Bell Satellite TV, EastLink, Telus Optik TV, VMedia, Vid√©otron, MTS, Bell Fibe TV, and Zazeen), or Cartoon Network (on Shaw Direct/Shaw Cable, Rogers Cable, SaskTel, and Westman Communications) taking over its slot on several providers. In the years since, Teletoon has aired classic programming during non-peak viewing hours. Teletoon at Night Launched in September 2002 as \\"The Detour on Teletoon\\", the block is an amalgamation of it and \\"Teletoon Unleashed\\", an adult programming block. Its French counterpart, T√©l√©toon la nuit, airs on the Francophone T√©l√©toon channel. In September 2009, the block was relaunched under its current name with an overhaul of its appearance. In March 2019, it was announced that the block would be discontinued due to the launch of the new Adult Swim channel on April 1, 2019. The block was since replaced by more kids and family-oriented programming although some programming from that block would air occasionally on the channel.

He was originally called Ars√®ne Lopin, until a local politician of the same name protested. The character was first introduced in a series of short stories serialized in the magazine Je sais tout. The first story, \\"The Arrest of Ars√®ne Lupin\\", was published on 15 July 1905. Lupin was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas by Leblanc, with the novellas or short stories collected into book form for a total of 24 books. The number becomes 25 if the 1923 novel The Secret Tomb is counted: Lupin doesn't appear in it, but the main character Doroth√©e solves one of Ars√®ne Lupin's four fabulous secrets. The character has also appeared in a number of books from other writers as well as numerous film, television, stage play, and comic book adaptations. Five authorized sequels were written in the 1970s by the celebrated mystery writing team of Boileau-Narcejac.  Origins  Ars√®ne Lupin is a literary descendant of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's Rocambole, whose adventures were published from 1857 to 1870. Like him, he is often a force for good, while operating on the wrong side of the law. Those whom Lupin defeats, always with his characteristic Gallic style and panache, are worse villains than he is. Lupin shares distinct similarities with E. W. Hornung's archetypal gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, whose stories were published from 1898 to 1909. Both Raffles and Lupin can be said to anticipate and have inspired later characters such as Louis Joseph Vance's The Lone Wolf (created in 1914) and Leslie Charteris's The Saint (created in 1928). The character of Ars√®ne Lupin might also have been based by Leblanc on French anarchist Marius Jacob (1879‚Äì1954), whose trial made headlines in March 1905, but Leblanc had also read Octave Mirbeau's Les 21 jours d'un neurasth√©nique (1901), which features a gentleman thief named Arthur Lebeau, and had seen Mirbeau's comedy Scrupules (1902), whose main character is a gentleman thief.  Fantasy elements  Several Ars√®ne Lupin novels contain some fantasy elements: a radioactive 'god-stone' that cures people and causes mutations is the object of an epic battle in L‚Äô√éle aux trente cercueils; the secret of the Fountain of Youth, a mineral water source hidden beneath a lake in the Auvergne, is the goal sought by the protagonists in La Demoiselle aux yeux verts; finally, in La Comtesse de Cagliostro, Lupin's arch-enemy and lover is none other than Jos√©phine Balsamo, the alleged granddaughter of Cagliostro himself.  Ars√®ne Lupin and Sherlock Holmes  Ars√®ne Lupin Contre Herlock Sholmes Leblanc introduced Sherlock Holmes to Lupin in the short story \\"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\\" in Je sais tout No. 17, 15 June 1906. In it, an aged Holmes meets a young Lupin for the first time. After legal objections from Doyle, the name was changed to \\"Herlock Sholmes\\" when the story was collected in book form in Volume 1. Sholmes returned in two more stories collected in Volume 2, \\"Ars√®ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholmes\\", and then in a guest-starring role in the battle for the secret of the Hollow Needle in L'Aiguille creuse. Ars√®ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholmes was published in the United States in 1910 under the title \\"The Blonde Lady\\" which used the name \\"Holmlock Shears\\" for Sherlock Holmes, and \\"Wilson\\" for Watson. In 813, Lupin manages to solve a riddle that Herlock Sholmes was unable to figure out. Sherlock Holmes, this time with his real name and accompanied by familiar characters such as Watson and Lestrade (all copyright protection having long expired), also confronted Ars√®ne Lupin in the 2008 PC 3D adventure game Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars√®ne Lupin. In this game Holmes (and occasionally others) are attempting to stop Lupin from stealing five valuable British items. Lupin wants to steal the items in order to humiliate Britain, but he also admires Holmes and thus challenges him to try to stop him. In a novella \\"The Prisoner of the Tower, or A Short But Beautiful Journey of Three Wise Men\\" by Boris Akunin published in 2008 in Russia as the conclusion of \\"Jade Rosary Beads\\" book, Sherlock Holmes and Erast Fandorin oppose Ars√®ne Lupin on December 31, 1899.

The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the tape recording back into the room, re-recording it. The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Since all rooms have characteristic resonance or formant frequencies (e.g. different between a large hall and a small room), the effect is that certain frequencies are emphasized as they resonate in the room, until eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the pure resonant harmonies and tones of the room itself.

Furthermore, in its ambient conversion of speech modules into drone frequencies, it unites the two principal structural components of Minimal music in general.\\" History and performances Lucier states that he was originally inspired to create I Am Sitting in a Room after a colleague mentioned attending a lecture at MIT in which Amar Bose described how he tested characteristics of the loudspeakers he was developing by feeding back audio into them that they had produced in the first place and then was picked up via microphones. The first recording of I am sitting in a room was made at the Electronic Music Studio at Brandeis University in 1969.Lucier, Alvin. I am sitting in a room. Lovely Music, Ltd., 1990. CD. The first performance of the work was in 1970 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In collaboration with his partner Mary Lucier, the perfomance featured projections of Polaroid images that had been degraded like the voice.https://bombmagazine.org/articles/mary-lucier A second, higher fidelity recording of I Am Sitting in a Room lasting over 40 minutes was released in 1981. Lucier performed the piece during the 2012 Venice Biennale Musica at the Teatro alle Tese, and a recording of this performance was commercially released on the 2016 album Alvin Lucier / Alter Ego: Two Circles. More recent performances include one at MIT's \\"Seeing/Sounding/Sensing\\" symposium in September 2014. In 2019 the full collaborative piece was performed for the first time in over 50 years as part of the New Ear Festival at the Fridman Gallery in New York. Full text The text spoken by Lucier describes the process of the work, concluding with a reference to his own stuttering: In popular culture In 2010, YouTube user Patrick Liddell created an homage to I Am Sitting in a Room entitled VIDEO ROOM 1000, in which he uploaded a video of himself speaking text similar to Lucier's original to YouTube, then manually downloaded and re-uploaded it 1,000 times in sequence over the course of a year, in order to demonstrate the resulting digital artifacting of audio and video analogously to Lucier's original demonstration of analog artifacting of audio. In 2013, filmmakers Viola Rusche and Hauke Harder decided to use I Am Sitting in a Room as the \\"main structuring element\\" of the documentary \\"No Ideas but In Things\\" (2013). According to the filmmakers' notes, \\"the various process steps of the piece [I am sitting in a room] divide the film into chapters so that this work serves as an integral part of the film.\\" In 2018, the YouTube user Tim Blais created a live streaming version of this experiment titled I Am Streaming in a Room. He livestreamed himself speaking, and then had software capture the original livestream and rebroadcast it to the stream. The segment repeated for approximately 1,170 iterations. In 2019, Youtuber MKBHD also created a similar video, titled This Is What Happens When You Re- Upload a YouTube Video 1000 Times repeating the same process with footage recorded from an Red Epic 8K Camera.

It was originally aired on May 10, 1992, in broadcast syndication. The episode was written by Ren√© Echevarria, with help from executive producer Jeri Taylor. It was directed by Robert Lederman, the film editor for The Next Generation, one of two directing credits he received during the course of the season. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. An injured Borg drone (Jonathan Del Arco) is found amid a crashed scout ship. As they restore him to health, the crew must decide whether or not to develop him as a weapon of mass destruction against the Borg; when he demonstrates free will, they must question that decision. The writers had problems bringing back the Borg due to their apparent near-invincibility. The idea for \\"I, Borg\\" was well received among the staff, with Taylor comparing it to the film Edward Scissorhands. The episode also saw a development in the make-up design for the Borg by Michael Westmore's team. Del Arco was deliberately antisocial prior to his audition to get into the role but also sought to use the innocence and wonderment generated by a friend's death as Hugh's voice. He was pleased when the character later returned in the two-part episode \\"Descent\\". The episode received Nielsen ratings of 12.8 percent and critics were positive with praise directed at both Del Arco and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as the general nature of the plot. Plot The crew discover a wrecked Borg scout ship with a single survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean- Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they come to understand the workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data devise an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan. The Borg drone initially calls himself \\"Third of Five\\", but ends up referring to and understanding himself as \\"Hugh\\" ‚Äì the name given to him by La Forge. Hugh discusses how the Borg only wish to learn about other cultures through assimilation, but La Forge counters this argument, discussing aspects of individuality that make them human and unique. In further debates, La Forge finds himself becoming a friend to Hugh, and begins to doubt his previous idea. This is further complicated when Hugh shows elements of individualism. The crew now debate whether it is appropriate to sacrifice one individual to protect the majority, though Picard is still insistent on destroying the Collective. Crusher and La Forge arrange to have Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who has a similar loathing for the Borg because they destroyed her homeworld, speak to Hugh. She finds Hugh to be not a mindless drone but a confused young man, and she agrees Hugh is no longer a Borg. Guinan convinces Picard to meet with Hugh, as well, and Picard comes to the same conclusion, in part because Hugh refers to himself as \\"I\\" instead of the Borg's collective \\"we\\" during their discussion. Picard abandons the proposed plan and instead offers Hugh asylum within the Federation. Hugh expresses enthusiasm at the prospect of remaining with La Forge but ultimately refuses, recognizing that the Borg will still come looking for him. He offers to be returned to the crash site, where he will be found and re-assimilated by the Borg. Picard hopes that, once Hugh is reconnected, the sense of individualism Hugh has learned will spread throughout the Collective. La Forge accompanies Hugh to the crash site and, from a safe distance, watches the Borg recover him. Just as the Borg transport out, Hugh turns to give La Forge a parting glance. Production Following the Borg-based two-part episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", the production team were having difficulty in introducing the Borg to the series due to their unstoppable nature. The story idea for \\"I, Borg\\" was well received by the production staff, with executive producer Rick Berman saying that he \\"fell in love\\" with the characterisations of Guinan,Gross & Altman (1993): p. 246 Picard, La Forge and Hugh which resulted in a series of two character scenes in the episode. Story editor Ren√© Echevarria wrote the script, with an uncredited assist from executive producer Jeri Taylor. She compared the idea to the film Edward Scissorhands (1990), saying that she felt it would become a \\"classic\\" and that the Borg \\"would never be the same again\\". Michael Piller, who wrote \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", described \\"I, Borg\\" as having a \\"great premise which forces Guinan and Picard to face their own prejudices\\". He said it was his favourite of the season. The episode was directed by Robert Lederman, his first of the series and the only new director during the fifth season. Lederman was also the film editor on the series,Nemecek (2003): p. 202 and would go on to also direct the episode \\"Force of Nature\\". \\"I, Borg\\" also marked the first time that Jay Chattaway scored a Borg related episode, but would continue to do so for the rest of the series and during Star Trek: Voyager. Design and casting of Hugh Jonathan Del Arco appeared as the individual Borg \\"Hugh\\" in \\"I, Borg\\". The design of the Borg prosthetics as used in \\"I, Borg\\" was an evolution from those previously seen in the series. Michael Westmore's make-up team developed a removable eye-piece for Hugh, using magnets to allow the actor to remove it as required by the script. The team wanted the eye-piece to be dramatic, but decided against using a laser as this had been previously used for Locutus of Borg. They instead opted for a hologram and a series of LEDs that were powered by a battery pack built into the costume and mounted on the actor's back.Westmore (2000): p. 88 The arm piece was also redeveloped; rather than a single \\"club\\" piece as previously used for the Borg, it was built from a foam- rubber glove with attachments.Westmore (2000): p. 89 Jonathan Del Arco had no concept of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He received his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that it gave him a decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately antisocial towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more. He had previously done a screen test for the role of character Wesley Crusher for this same show.[] He said that his performance in \\"I, Borg\\" was driven by the memories of watching a childhood friend die, and the innocence that he felt given to his friend's memory over time; \\"When I first read the script. I heard his voice, that's what it sounded like ‚Äì full of wonderment and confusion about everything. That, to me, was Hugh.\\" Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the sixth season finale/seventh season opener \\"Descent\\", which he felt was similar to his previous ideas. Reception and home media release The episode aired during the week commencing May 10, 1992, in broadcast syndication. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received ratings of 12.8 percent. This means that it was watched by 12.8 percent of all households watching television during its timeslot. When broadcast it was the seventh most watched episode of the season, behind both parts of \\"Unification\\", \\"A Matter of Time\\", \\"Power Play\\", \\"Cause and Effect\\" and \\"The Game\\". Keith DeCandido in his review for Tor.com gave the episode a score of 8 out of 10, and described Goldberg's appearance as \\"particularly good\\", while Del Arco was said to be \\"spectacular\\" in his \\"subtle, powerful performance\\". DeCandido criticised the \\"defanging\\" of the Borg, but understood why the writers took the approach they did as a near-unstoppable enemy is difficult to write for. He praised the characterisations, specifically for Crusher, and added \\"it‚Äôs never a bad thing when TNG actually remembers its character continuity\\". James Van Hise, in his book The Complete Trek: The Next Generation, said that the episode \\"enriched the creative tapestry of the series\\" and gave the writers a number of possibilities for following it up.van Hise (1995): p. 128 Sven Harvey included \\"I, Borg\\" in a list of 25 \\"must watch\\" episodes of the series compiled for Den of Geek, describing it as \\"a wonderfully written and executed episode which lays a path for later developments\\". Zack Handlen gave \\"I, Borg\\" a grade of A- in his review for The A.V. Club, and while he was disappointed that the Borg were made less \\"nightmarish\\", the question of genocide that hung over the episode and the expansion of potential story ideas from the plot made it worth it. In a review of 25 greatest science fiction episodes by SyFy of the years between 1992 and 2017, \\"I, Borg\\" was the only Star Trek episode selected, although this excluded any episodes before 1993 or so. A 2009 article by Newsweek, noted this episode for emergence of independent identity, and of empathy and forgiveness. They remark, \\"As the Borg, cut off from the collective mind, begins to recognize itself as an individual, so do Picard and Guinan.\\" In 2011, this episode was noted by Forbes as exploring the implications of advanced technology, showing how an isolated Borg alien must learn how to be an individual. In May 2019, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it among a top twenty five episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2016, Empire ranked this the 34th best out of the top 50 episodes of the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked Jonathan Del Arco as in Star Trek: The Next Generation as one of the top ten guest star roles on Star Trek: The Next Generation. He appears in the role of Third of Five (i.e. Hugh), in \\"I, Borg\\" and \\"Descent, Part II\\". Variety listed \\"I, Borg\\" as one of the top 15 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2019, Screen Rant ranked \\"I, Borg\\" the sixth best episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2019, The Hollywood Reporter listed this among the twenty five best episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Releases \\"I, Borg\\" was first released on VHS cassette in the United States and Canada on October 7, 1997. The episode was later released in the United States on November 5, 2002, as part of the season five DVD box set. It was subsequently released as part of the Star Trek: Fan Collective ‚Äì Borg collection on DVD, which brought together the Borg-themed episodes from The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise. The first Blu-ray release was in the United States on November 19, 2013, followed by the United Kingdom on November 18. Watch guides The Nerdist included this episode as part of a story arc of this TV show. They propose a story arc with the Enterprise 1701-D confronting the Borg, that would include \\"Q Who?\\", \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", \\"I, Borg\\", and \\"Descent\\".

After Santa Fe was captured and scuttled by the British in South Georgia on 28 April, and the nuclear submarine had sunk the cruiser on 2 May, the Argentine fleet retired to port for the duration of the war, with the exception of San Luis, making her the only Argentine naval presence facing the British fleet. San Luis was a major concern for the British as she presented a serious danger to all British warships in the area.

The frigate had made passage up Falkland Sound, sinking an Argentine merchant navy ship on the way. As Alacrity left the channel before dawn, sister ship was waiting to accompany her back to the Task Force. San Luis detected the two ships and fired two SST-4 torpedoes, one of which did not leave its tube; the other was apparently defeated by Arrows anti-torpedo measures. There were several problems with torpedoes and torpedo systems; in particular it appears that the torpedoes were not prepared properly, and did not arm themselves after firing, so would not explode even if they did hit a target. It has been suggested that previous apparent misses could have been due to torpedoes which struck home but did not explode. After the Falklands War ended, German and Dutch engineers were sent to Argentina to discover what went wrong with their torpedoes. The problem was found to be that one of the Argentine sailors who was in charge of periodic maintenance of the torpedoes had inadvertently reversed the polarity of power cables between the torpedoes and the submarine. This meant that when the torpedoes' gyros were spun up, they ran \\"backwards\\" and thus tumbled on launch, preventing the weapons from taking up their proper heading. The mere presence of San Luis was a severe nuisance to the Task Force. The threat posed by San Luis forced the Royal Navy to suspend the rescue efforts of two Sea King helicopters who ditched at sea on 12 May and 18 May 1982 respectively, while conducting anti-submarine operations.

Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended, Ferdinand VII, recently restored to the throne in Spain, decided to send military forces to retake most of the northern South American colonies, which had established autonomous juntas and independent states. The invaders, with support from loyal colonial troops, completed the reconquest of New Granada by taking Bogot√° on May 6, 1816. The expeditionary force and campaigns In 1815, Spain sent to its most seditious colonies the strongest expeditionary force that it had ever sent to the Americas. Colonel Pablo Morillo, a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French, was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly 60 ships. Originally, they were to head for Montevideo in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Viceroyalty of New Granada (present-day Colombia, Ecuador, Panama) and Venezuela. Leaving the port of C√°diz on February 17, 1815, the force initially landed at Carupano and the island of Margarita in April, where no resistance was encountered. After leaving the island, Morillo's troops reinforced existing royalist forces in the Venezuelan mainland, entering Cuman√° and Caracas in May. A small part of the main corps set off towards Panam√°, while the main contingent was directed from Puerto Cabello towards the Neogranadine coastal city of Santa Marta which was still in royalist hands. After picking up supplies and militia volunteers in Santa Marta on July 23, the Spanish expeditionary forces besieged Cartagena. After a five-month siege the fortified city fell on December 1815. By 1816, the combined efforts of Spanish and colonial forces, marching south from Cartagena and north from royalist strongholds in Quito, Pasto, and Popay√°n, completed the reconquest of New Granada, taking Bogot√° on May 6, 1816. A permanent consejo de guerra was set up to judge those accused of treason and rebellion, resulting in the execution of more than a hundred notable republican officials, including Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Francisco Jos√© de Caldas and Jos√© Mar√≠a Cabal. Units of the republican armies of New Granada were incorporated into the royalist army and sent to Peru. Patriot reactions On learning of the arrival of the expeditionary force, republican leaders assumed various positions. Internal divisions, which had developed during the previous years of struggle, softened but still remained a considerable obstacle. In the end, they prevented a coordinated effort by the different factions, although there were some attempts to do so, such as under the United Provinces of New Granada. One significant factor in the disunity was that representatives of the United Kingdom and of the United States refused to grant political recognition and would not commit the sufficient amount of economic and military aid to successfully resist Morillo's force. In addition, the provinces themselves did not give each other much-needed aid. Finally, several notable individuals, whose leadership would have been useful, decided to exile themselves, although other republican leaders remained in the region and tried to reorganize their military and political activities in order to face the new threat. As a result of the internal conflicts in New Granada, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who had been acting under the authority of the United Provinces, left his command on May 8, 1815, after failing to subdue Cartagena in March in retaliation for its refusal to give him arms and men. Bol√≠var traveled to Jamaica and later Haiti, a small republic that had freed itself from French rule, where he and other independence leaders were given a friendly reception. Eventually, the growing exile community received money, volunteers and weapons from Haitian president Alexandre P√©tion, and resumed the struggle for independence in the remote border areas of both New Granada and Venezuela, where they established irregular guerrilla bands with the locals. This formed the basis from which the struggle to establish republics successfully spread towards the other areas of South America under Spanish control.

The incidence of clubbing is unknown; it was present in about 1% of people admitted to an internal medicine unit of a hospital. Clubbing has been recognized as a sign of disease since the time of Hippocrates. Causes Clubbing is associated with * Lung disease:  Lung cancer, mainly non-small-cell (54% of all cases), not seen frequently in small-cell lung cancer (< 5% of cases)  Interstitial lung disease most commonly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  Complicated tuberculosis  Suppurative lung disease: lung abscess, empyema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis  Mesothelioma of the pleura  Arteriovenous fistula or malformation  Sarcoidosis * Heart disease:  Any disease featuring chronic hypoxia  Congenital cyanotic heart disease (most common cardiac cause)  Subacute bacterial endocarditis  Atrial myxoma (benign tumor)  Tetralogy of Fallot * Gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary:  Malabsorption  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  Cirrhosis, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis  Hepatopulmonary syndrome, a complication of cirrhosis * Others:  Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism) ‚Äì in this case it is known as thyroid acropachy  Familial and hereditary clubbing and \\"pseudoclubbing\\" (people of African descent often have what appears to be clubbing)  Vascular anomalies of the affected arm such as an axillary artery aneurysm (in unilateral clubbing) Nail clubbing is not specific to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, in patients with COPD and significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) might still be indicated. A congenital form has also been recognized. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy Bone scan of a patient with HPOA A special form of clubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), known in continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis. It is commonly associated with lung cancer. Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine‚ÄìSolente‚ÄìGol√© syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of prostaglandin E2 and elevated levels of this substance. Pathophysiology The exact cause for sporadic clubbing is unknown. Theories as to its cause include: *Vasodilation (i.e., distended blood vessels). *Secretion of growth factors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) from the lungs. *Overproduction of prostaglandin E2 by other tissues. *Increased entry of megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. Under normal circumstances in healthy individuals, megakaryocytes that arise from the bone marrow are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed and broken down before they enter the systemic circulation. It is thought that in disorders where there is right-to-left shunting or lung malignancy, the megakaryocytes can bypass the breakdown within the pulmonary circulation and enter the systemic circulation. They are then trapped within the capillary beds within the extremities, such as the digits, and release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PDGF and VEGF have growth promoting properties and cause connective tissue hypertrophy and capillary permeability. Diagnosis Clubbing of the fingernail: The red line shows the outline of a clubbed nail. When clubbing is observed, pseudoclubbing should be excluded before making the diagnosis. Associated conditions may be identified by taking a detailed medical history‚Äîparticular attention is paid to lung, heart, and gastrointestinal conditions‚Äîand conducting a thorough clinical examination, which may disclose associated features relevant to the underlying diagnosis. Additional studies such as a chest X-ray and a chest CT-scan may reveal otherwise asymptomatic cardiopulmonary disease. Stages Clubbing is present in one of five stages: * No visible clubbing - Fluctuation (increased ballotability) and softening of the nail bed only. No visible changes of nails. * Mild clubbing - Loss of the normal <165¬∞ angle (Lovibond angle) between the nailbed and the fold (cuticula). Schamroth's window (see below) is obliterated. Clubbing is not obvious at a glance. * Moderate clubbing - Increased convexity of the nail fold. Clubbing is apparent at a glance. * Gross clubbing - Thickening of the whole distal (end part of the) finger (resembling a drumstick) * Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy - Shiny aspect and striation of the nail and skin Schamroth's test or Schamroth's window test (originally demonstrated by South African cardiologist Leo Schamroth on himself) is a popular test for clubbing. When the distal phalanges (bones nearest the fingertips) of corresponding fingers of opposite hands are directly opposed (place fingernails of same finger on opposite hands against each other, nail to nail), a small diamond-shaped \\"window\\" is normally apparent between the nailbeds. If this window is obliterated, the test is positive and clubbing is present.

A 2008 study found clubbing in 1%, or 15 patients, of 1511 patients admitted to a department of internal medicine in Belgium. Of these, 40%, or 6 patients, turned out to have significant underlying disease of various causes, while 60%, or 9 patients, had no medical problems on further investigations and remained well over the subsequent year.

These signs can be detectable by anyone, e.g. the temperature or blood pressure of the patient, skin that is redder than usual, or a bruise; others may have no meaning to the patient or may even go completely unnoticed. Medical signs assist a healthcare provider to reach an accurate diagnosis. A symptom is something, such as pain or dizziness, experienced by the patient. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive. In other words, many symptoms such as feeling hot, are associated with a medical sign such as a thermometer reading showing an above average body temperature.Marie T. O'Toole, ed., Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 9th ed. (St. Louis, MO: Elsevier/Mosby, 2013), Kindle loc. 154641. Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but certain combinations can be suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. Examples of signs include elevated blood pressure, clubbing of the ends of fingers as a sign of lung disease, staggering gait, and arcus senilis of the eyes. In medicine, a sign is distinguished from an indication; a specific reason for using a treatment. Semiotics Semiotics is derived from the Greek adjective œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπœâœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (semeiotikos) \\"to do with signs\\". In English the art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called semiotics, a term now used for the study of sign communication in general. Semiotics, then written semeiotics, was first used in English in 1670 by Henry Stubbe (1631-1676), to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs: :...nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology (founded on observation, not principles), semeiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines....Stubbe, H. (Henry Stubbe), The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus: Or, A Specimen of some Animadversions upon the Plus Ultra of Mr. Glanvill, wherein sundry Errors of some Virtuosi are discovered, the Credit of the Aristotelians in part Re-advanced; and Enquiries made... (London), 1670, p. 75 Signs versus symptoms Signs are different from \\"symptoms\\"‚Äîthose subjective experiences, such as fatigue or headache‚Äîthat patients might report to their physician. For convenience, signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows: Both are something abnormal, relevant to a potential medical condition, but a symptom is experienced and reported by the patient, while a sign is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by means of an in vivo examination of the patient. A slightly different definition views signs as any indication of a medical condition that can be objectively observed (i.e., by someone other than the patient), whereas a symptom is a manifestation of a condition experienced by the patient. A doctor may discover the sign of high blood pressure in a patient who does not report any symptoms associated with hypertension, and who does not realize they have a potentially harmful condition. There is some overlap between signs and symptoms‚Äîcertain things may qualify as both a sign and a symptom, such as a bloody nose. Lester S. King, author of Medical Thinking, argues that an \\"essential feature\\" of a sign is that there is both a sign [or \\"signifier\\"] and a \\"thing signified\\". And, because \\"the essence of a sign is to convey information\\", it can only be a sign, properly speaking, if it has meaning. Therefore, \\"a sign ceases to be a sign when you cannot read it\\". A person, who has and exercises the knowledge required to understand the significance or indication or meaning of the sign, is necessary for something to be a complete sign. A physical phenomenon that is not actually interpreted as a sign pointing to something else is, in medicine, merely a symptom. Thus, King rejects \\"these present-day views [distinguishing signs from symptoms based on patient-subjective versus clinician-objective], however widely accepted, as quite faulty, at variance not only with ordinary usage but with the entire history of medicine.\\" > \\"[A] symptom is a phenomenon, caused by an illness and observable directly > in experience. We may speak of it as a manifestation of illness. When the > observer reflects on that phenomenon and uses it as a base for further > inferences, then that symptom is transformed into a sign. As a sign it > points beyond itself‚Äîperhaps to the present illness, or to the past or to > the future. That to which a sign points is part of its meaning, which may be > rich and complex, or scanty, or any gradation in between. In medicine, then, > a sign is thus a phenomenon from which we may get a message, a message that > tells us something about the patient or the disease. A phenomenon or > observation that does not convey a message is not a sign. The distinction > between signs and symptom rests on the meaning, and this is not perceived > but inferred.\\" Types Medical signs may be classified by the type of inference that may be made from their presence, for example: * Prognostic signs (from progign·πìskein, œÄœÅŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ≥ŒΩœéœÉŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ, \\"to know beforehand\\"): signs that indicate the future outcome of the current bodily state of the patient, rather than indicating the name of the disease. Perhaps the most famous prognostic sign is the facies Hippocratica: > \\"[If the patient's facial] appearance may be described thus: the nose sharp, > the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their > lobes distorted, the skin of the face hard, stretched and dry, and the > colour of the face pale or dusky.‚Ä¶ and if there is no improvement within [a > prescribed period of time], it must be realized that this sign portends > death.\\" * Anamnestic signs (from anamnƒìstik√≥s, ·ºÄŒΩŒ±ŒºŒΩŒ∑œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, \\"able to recall to mind\\"): signs that (taking into account the current state of a patient's body), indicate the past existence of a certain disease or condition. Anamnestic signs always point to the past. (As King (1982) explains, whenever we see a man walking with a particular gait, with one arm paralysed in a particular way, we say \\"This man has had a stroke\\"; and, if we see a woman in her late 50s with one arm distorted in a particular way, we say \\"She had polio as a child\\".) * Diagnostic signs (from diagn≈çstik√≥s, Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, \\"able to distinguish\\"): signs that lead to the recognition and identification of a disease (i.e., they indicate the name of the disease). *\\"'List of eponymously named medical signs\\"': signs named after people. * Pathognomonic signs (from pathognomonik√≥s, œÄŒ±Œ∏ŒøŒ≥ŒΩœâŒºŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, \\"skilled in diagnosis\\", derived from p√°thos, œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ, \\"suffering, disease\\", and gn·πìmon, Œ≥ŒΩœéŒºŒøŒΩ, \\"judge, indicator\\"): the particular signs whose presence indicates with certainty, that a particular disease is present. They are an intensification of a diagnostic sign. An example is the palmar xanthomata seen on the hands of people with hyperlipoproteinaemia. > \\"Symptoms become signs when they permit inference. Ordinarily, one single > symptom by itself‚Äîsuch as pain or swelling, or discoloration, or bloody > discharge‚Äîwould not permit any specific inference, but when symptoms occur > in clusters and form a pattern, then the aggregate might point to a > particular disease. The pathognomonic sign, however, does not need any other > manifestation to lead the physician to the correct diagnosis. It constitutes > a one-to-one relationship‚Äîthe sign and the disease are uniquely related. The > pathognomonic sign was the \\"clincher\\", the datum that established the > diagnosis unequivocally.\\" Development of signs detectable by physicians Prior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a co-operative interaction between the physician and patient; this was gradually replaced by a \\"monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators\\".Jewson, N.D., \\"Medical Knowledge and the Patronage System in 18th Century England \\", Sociology, Vol. 8, No. 3 (1974), pp. 369‚Äì85.Jewson, N.D., \\"The Disappearance of the Sick Man from Medical Cosmology, 1770-1870 \\", Sociology, Vol. 10, No. 2, (1976), pp. 225‚Äì44. Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: \\"the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not\\". Advances in the 19th century Input from the patient was gradually reduced from the medical interaction due to significant technological advances such as: * The 1808 introduction of the percussion technique, \\"the process through which \\"the physician can assess the state of the underlying lung by sensing the character of vibrations by gentle taps on the chest wall [something which] greatly facilitated the diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases\\". The techniques, which had been first described by the Viennese physician Leopold Auenbrugger (1722-1809) in 1761, became far more widely known following the publication of Jean-Nicolas Corvisart's (French) translation of Auenbrugger's (Latin) work in 1808. * The 1819 introduction by Ren√© Laennec (1781-1826) of the technique of auscultation (using a stethoscope to listen to the circulatory and respiratory functions of the body). Laennec's publication was translated into English, 1821-1834, by John Forbes. * The 1846 introduction by surgeon John Hutchinson (1811-1861) of the spirometer, an apparatus for assessing the mechanical properties of the lungs via measurements of forced exhalation and forced inhalation. (The recorded lung volumes and air flow rates are used to distinguish between restrictive disease (in which the lung volumes are decreased: e.g., cystic fibrosis) and obstructive diseases (in which the lung volume is normal but the air flow rate is impeded; e.g., emphysema).) * The 1851 invention by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) of the ophthalmoscope, which allowed physicians to examine the inside of the human eye. * The (c. 1870) immediate widespread clinical use of Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt's (1836‚Äì1925) six-inch (rather than twelve-inch) pocket clinical thermometer, which he had devised in 1867.Allbutt, T.C., \\"Medical Thermometry\\", British and Foreign Medico- Chirurgical Review, Vol. 45, No. 90, (April 1870), pp. 429‚Äì41; Vol. 46, No. 91, (July 1870), pp. 144‚Äì56. * The 1882 introduction of bacterial cultures by Robert Koch, initially for tuberculosis, being the first laboratory test to confirm bacterial infections. * The 1895 clinical use of X-rays which began almost immediately after they had been discovered that year by Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen (1845-1923). * The 1896 introduction of the sphygmomanometer, designed by Scipione Riva-Rocci (1863-1937), to measure blood pressure. Changes of relationship between physicians and patients The introduction of the techniques of percussion and auscultation into medical practice altered the relationship between physician and patient in a significant way, specifically because these techniques relied almost entirely upon the physician listening to the sounds of the patient's body. Not only did this development reduce the patient's capacity to observe and contribute to the process of diagnosis, it also meant that the patient was often instructed to stop talking, and remain silent. As these changes took place in medical practice, it was increasingly necessary to uniquely identify data that were accessible only to the physician, and to be able to differentiate those observations from others that were also available to the patient, and it just seemed natural to use \\"signs\\" for the class of physician-specific data, and \\"symptoms\\" for the class of observations available to the patient. King proposes a more advanced notion; namely, that a sign is something that has meaning, regardless of whether it is observed by the physician or reported by the patient: As tests In some senses, the process of diagnosis is always a matter of assessing the likelihood that a given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with haemoptysis (coughing up blood), the haemoptysis is very much more likely to be caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken their toe. Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along. Examination, which is essentially looking for clinical signs, allows the medical practitioner to see if there is evidence in the patient's body to support their hypotheses about the disease that might be present. A patient who has given a good story to support a diagnosis of tuberculosis might be found, on examination, to show signs that lead the practitioner away from that diagnosis and more towards sarcoidosis, for example. Examination for signs tests the practitioner's hypotheses, and each time a sign is found that supports a given diagnosis, that diagnosis becomes more likely. Special tests (blood tests, radiology, scans, a biopsy, etc.) also allow a hypothesis to be tested. These special tests are also said to show signs in a clinical sense. Again, a test can be considered pathognonomic for a given disease, but in that case the test is generally said to be \\"diagnostic\\" of that disease rather than pathognonomic. An example would be a history of a fall from a height, followed by a lot of pain in the leg. The signs (a swollen, tender, distorted lower leg) are only very strongly suggestive of a fracture; it might not actually be broken, and even if it is, the particular kind of fracture and its degree of dislocation need to be known, so the practitioner orders an x-ray‚Äîand, for example, if the x-ray were to show a fractured tibia, the film would be diagnostic of the fracture. Examples of signs * Ascites * Clubbing (deformed nails) * Cough * Death rattle (last moments of life in a person/animal) * Fever * Gynecomastia (excessive breast tissue in males) * Hemoptysis (blood-stained sputum) * Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) * Icterus (\\"jaundice\\") * Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) * Palmar erythema (reddening of hands) * Saliva, excessive (hypersalivation) * Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) *Weight loss See also * Focal neurologic signs * Radiologic sign * Medical test * Biomarker * Medical findings, including clinical findings (signs and symptoms) and other laboratory findings. * Vital sign References External links * Who Named It? : eponymous signs.

It is the eighth episode of the fourth season. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, during an away mission, Riker falls unconscious and awakens to discover that sixteen years have passed, and he is now captain of the Enterprise. Having no memory whatsoever of the time that has passed, he begins to suspect that the future he finds himself in may not be real. Plot Commander Riker's birthday celebration is interrupted as he, Geordi La Forge, and Worf are sent down to a huge cavern on Alpha Onias III, an uninhabited Class M planet, to investigate unusual readings. After their arrival, the cavern suddenly fills with toxic gases, and the three officers fall unconscious. Riker awakens in sick bay to find that sixteen years have passed. He is now Captain of the Enterprise with Data as his first officer, and Picard has been promoted to admiral, with Deanna Troi serving as his aide. Riker cannot remember any event after the Alpha Onias III mission, which Doctor Crusher explains is a side effect of a viral infection he contracted on the planet, and his memories of the intervening events may or may not return in time. Riker learns that he was married, is now widowed, and has a son (Chris Demetral) named Jean-Luc (named after Picard). He is further startled when Tomalak ‚Äî a Romulan commander who was formerly an archenemy of the Enterprise, now an ambassador ‚Äî beams onto the ship to negotiate a peace treaty with the Federation. Despite Picard's reassurances, Riker is hesitant to reveal sensitive Starfleet information in negotiating the treaty. As Riker struggles to adjust to his new life, numerous inconsistencies arise. The Enterprise computer is uncharacteristically slow, numerous systems experience minor technical glitches, and Geordi is unable to correct the problems. Finally, Riker discovers that his late wife \\"Min\\" is Minuet, a fictional holodeck character he fell in love with (in the first-season episode \\"11001001\\"). Riker realizes that the entire \\"future\\" he has been experiencing is a charade and confronts Picard and Tomalak on the Enterprise bridge, with more inconsistencies arising as he does so, proving his suspicions. Suddenly, the false future fades away, revealing a Romulan holodeck. Commander Tomalak is revealed to be behind the simulation, the object of which was to trick Riker into giving away the location of a key Federation outpost. The Romulans, Tomalak explains, were fooled by the intensity of Riker's memories of Minuet and had incorporated her into their fantasy on the assumption that she was real. Riker is put in a holding area, where he meets the boy whose image the Romulans had used to create his \\"son\\". The boy identifies himself as \\"Ethan\\". Together, they manage to escape and briefly elude their Romulan guards. However, as the two are hiding from their pursuers, Ethan inadvertently refers to Tomalak as \\"Ambassador\\", instead of \\"Commander\\". Riker realizes that he is still in a simulation; confronting Ethan over it, he demands that the game end immediately and that he be allowed to leave. Everything disappears once more, leaving only Riker and Ethan back in the cavern on Alpha Onias III. Riker is then able to contact the ship and learns that Worf and La Forge had beamed up without incident, but the Enterprise was unable to locate him. After Riker advises the captain that he will presently report back after learning more about his situation, Ethan confesses that he had created the simulations, using sophisticated scanners to read his mind and create the \\"reality\\" they experienced. Ethan's planet had been attacked and his people killed; his mother had hidden him in the cavern for his own safety, with all the simulation equipment, before she died; and Ethan, all alone, had been yearning for real companionship. Realizing Ethan's intentions were not hostile, Riker offers him refuge on the Enterprise. Ethan accepts Riker's offer and after Ethan reveals his true form as a grey-skinned insectoid alien named Barash, the two beam onto the ship. Reception Zach Handlen of The A. V. Club gave the episode a grade A‚àí. In 2017, Popular Mechanics said that \\"Future Imperfect\\" was one of the top ten 'most fun' episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.popularmechanics.com In 2019, CBR rated \\"Future Imperfect\\" the 5th best 'holodeck' episode of the Star Trek franchise. In 2016, Empire ranked this the 26th best out of the top 50 episodes of all the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes.

The couple had four children: George (1882‚Äì1943), Eric (*1884), William (1886‚Äì1909)Smothers in Orchard in Los Angeles Times, 27 February 1909. and Sebastian (1887‚Äì1923) inventor of the jungle gym. In 1883 he went through a marriage ceremony with Maud Florence, by whom he had had twin children, under the assumed identity of John Weldon. He was subsequently convicted of bigamy and spent three days in prison, losing his job at Uppingham. His father James Hinton was a radical advocate of polygamous relationships,A cultural history of higher space, 1853-1907 [work in progress] Mark Blacklock and according to Charles' mother James had once remarked to her: \\"Christ was the saviour of Men but I am the saviour of Women and I don't envy him a bit.\\"Havelock Ellis papers, British Library. In 1887 Charles moved with Mary Ellen to Japan to work in a mission before accepting a job as headmaster of the Victoria Public School. In 1893 he sailed to the United States on the SS Tacoma to take up a post at Princeton University as an instructor in mathematics. In 1897, he designed a gunpowder-powered baseball pitching machine for the Princeton baseball team's batting practice.Hinton, Charles, \\"A Mechanical Pitcher\\", Harper's Weekly, 20 March 1897, p. 301-302. The machine was versatile, capable of variable speeds with an adjustable breech size, and firing curve balls by the use of two rubber-coated steel fingers at the muzzle of the pitcher.Hinton, Charles, \\"The Motion of a Baseball\\", The Yearbook of the Minneapolis Society of Engineers, May, 1908, p. 18-28. He successfully introduced the machine to the University of Minnesota, where Hinton worked as an assistant professor until 1900, when he resigned to move to the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. At the end of his life, Hinton worked as an examiner of chemical patents for the United States Patent Office. At age 54, he died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage on 30 April 1907 in Washington D.C..\\"Scientist Drops Dead\\", The Washington Post, 1 May 1907.Several of these references are cited in the introduction to the book Speculations on the Fourth Dimension, edited by Rudolf Rucker. After Hinton's sudden death his wife, Mary Ellen, committed suicide, also in Washington, D.C., in May 1908.\`My Right To Die¬¥, Woman Kills Self in The Washington Times v. 28 May 1908 (PDF); Mrs. Mary Hinton A Suicide in The New York Times v. 29 May 1908 (PDF). Fourth dimension Frontispiece to Charles Howard Hinton‚Äôs 1904 book The Fourth Dimension, illustrating the tesseract, the four- dimensional analog of the cube. Hinton's spelling varied: also known, as here, \\"tessaract\\". In an 1880 article entitled \\"What is the Fourth Dimension?\\", Hinton suggested that points moving around in three dimensions might be imagined as successive cross-sections of a static four-dimensional arrangement of lines passing through a three-dimensional plane, an idea that anticipated the notion of world lines. Hinton's explorations of higher space had a moral basis: > Hinton argues that gaining an intuitive perception of higher space required > that we rid ourselves of the ideas of right and left, up and down, that > inheres in our position as observers in a three-dimensional world. Hinton > calls the process \\"casting out the self\\", equates it with the process of > sympathizing with another person, and implies the two processes are mutually > reinforcing.Anne De Witt (2013) Moral Authority, Men of Science, and the > Victorian Novel, page 173, Cambridge University Press Hinton created several new words to describe elements in the fourth dimension. According to the OED, he first used the word tesseract in 1888 in his book A New Era of Thought. He also invented the words kata (from the Greek for \\"down from\\") and ana (from the Greek for \\"up toward\\") to describe the additional two opposing fourth-dimensional directions (an additional 4th axis of motion analogous to left-right (x), up-down (y), and forwards-backwards (z)). Hinton's Scientific romances, including \\"What is the Fourth Dimension?\\" and \\"A Plane World\\", were published as a series of nine pamphlets by Swan Sonnenschein & Co. during 1884-1886\\\\. In the introduction to \\"A Plane World\\", Hinton referred to Abbott's recent Flatland as having similar design but different intent. Abbott used the stories as \\"a setting wherein to place his satire and his lessons. But we wish in the first place to know the physical facts.\\" Hinton's world existed along the perimeter of a circle rather than on an infinite flat plane. He extended the connection to Abbott's work with An Episode of Flatland: Or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension (1907).  Influence  Hinton's advocacy of the tesseract as a means to perceive higher dimensions spawned a long lineage of science fiction, fantasy, and spiritual works that similarly refer to the tesseract as a way to understandor even accesshigher dimensions, including Charles Leadbeater's Clairvoyance (1899), Claude Bragdon's A Primer of Higher Space (1913), Algernon Blackwood's Victim of Higher Space (1914), H. P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Out of Time (1935), Robert Heinlein's \\"‚ÄîAnd He Built a Crooked House‚Äî\\" (1941), Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time (1962), and Christopher Nolan's film Interstellar (2014).White, Christopher G., 2018. Other Worlds: Spirituality and the Search for Invisible Dimensions. Harvard University Press. Hinton was one of the many thinkers who circulated in Jorge Luis Borges's pantheon of writers. Hinton is mentioned in Borges' short stories \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\", \\"There Are More Things\\" and \\"El milagro secreto\\" (\\"The Secret Miracle\\"): Hinton influenced P. D. Ouspensky's thinking. Many of ideas Ouspensky presents in \\"Tertium Organum\\" mention Hinton's works. Hinton's \\"scientific romance\\", the \\"Unlearner\\", is cited by John Dewey in Art as Experience, chapter 3. The story described by John Dewey is actually titled \\"An Unfinished Communication\\" and is part of the second series of \\"Scientific Romances\\". The Unlearner is a character in this story, which might explain why John Dewey confused the title of the story. Hinton is the main character of Carlos Atanes's play Un genio olvidado (Un rato en la vida de Charles Howard Hinton). The play was premiered on Madrid in May 2015 and published in May 2017. Hinton is mentioned several times in Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell; his theories regarding the fourth dimension form the basis of the book's final chapter. His father, James Hinton, appears in chapters 4 and 10. He is mentioned twice in Aleister Crowley's novel Moonchild. The first mention mistakenly names his father, James Hinton.

The reflex can take one of two forms. In healthy adults, the plantar reflex causes a downward response of the hallux (flexion). An upward response (extension) of the hallux is known as the Babinski response or Babinski sign, named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski. The presence of the Babinski sign can identify disease of the spinal cord and brain in adults, and also exists as a primitive reflex in infants. While first described in the medical literature by Babinski in 1896,Comptes rendus de la Soci√©t√© de Biologie, Vol. 48, 1896, p. 207, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6459605g/f225.image the reflex has been identified in art at least as early as Botticelli's Madonna and Child With an Angel, painted in the mid-15th century. Methods Pathological Babinski's sign in adult The lateral side of the sole of the foot is rubbed with a blunt instrument or device so as not to cause pain, discomfort, or injury to the skin; the instrument is run from the heel along a curve to the toes (metatarsal pads). Many reflex hammers taper at the end of the handle to a point which was used for testing the plantar response in the past, however, due to the tightening of infection control regulation this is no longer recommended. Either a single use device or the thumb nail should be used. There are three responses possible: * Flexor: the toes curve down and inwards, and the foot inverts; this is the response seen in healthy adults. * Indifferent: there is no response. * Extensor: the hallux dorsiflexes, and the other toes fan out; this is Babinski's sign, which indicates damage to the central nervous system if elicited in an adult, but normal reflex if elicited in infants (see below). As the lesion responsible for the sign expands, so does the area from which the afferent Babinski response may be elicited. The Babinski response is also normal while asleep and after a long period of walking. Interpretation Babinski's sign in a healthy newborn The Babinski sign can indicate upper motor neuron lesion constituting damage to the corticospinal tract. Occasionally, a pathological plantar reflex is the first and only indication of a serious disease process and a clearly abnormal plantar reflex often prompts detailed neurological investigations, including CT scanning of the brain or MRI of the spine, as well as lumbar puncture for the study of cerebrospinal fluid. The phrase \\"negative Babinski sign\\" is sometimes used for the normal flexor plantar response. In infants Infants will usually show an extensor response. In one study of 256 healthy infants, the response to testing was extensor in 73.8%, flexor in 8.9%, and equivocal in 17.3% This extensor response occurs because the corticospinal pathways that run from the brain down the spinal cord are not fully myelinated at this age, so the reflex is not inhibited by the cerebral cortex. The extensor response usually disappears ‚Äì giving way to the flexor response ‚Äì by 12 months of age. Its persistence beyond age 2‚Äì3 indicates a problem in the brain or spinal cord. Pathways * Afferent: Nociception detected in the S1 dermatome and travels up the tibial nerve to the sciatic nerve to roots of L5,S1 and synapse in the anterior horn to elicit the motor response. * Efferent: Motor response back through the L5,S1 roots to the sciatic nerve to its bifurcation. Toe flexors are innervated by the tibial nerve. Toe extensors (extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus) are innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. Loss of normal adult descending pyramidal control of the reflex arc to suppress extensor withdrawal results in the upgoing toes in the plantar reflex known as Babinski's sign. Relationship to Hoffmann's reflex The Hoffmann's reflex is sometimes described as the upper limb equivalent of the Babinski sign because both indicate upper motor neuron dysfunction. Mechanistically, they differ significantly; the finger flexor reflex is a simple monosynaptic spinal reflex involving the flexor digitorum profundus that is normally fully inhibited by upper motor neurons. The pathway producing the plantar response is more complicated, and is not monosynaptic.  Babinski-like responses  The plantar reflex can be elicited in a number of ways, which were described in the late 19th and early 20th century. These have their own eponyms. *Bing sign - multiple pinpricks on the dorsum of the foot *Cornell sign - scratching along the inner side of the extensor hallucis longus tendon *Chaddock sign - stroking the lateral malleolus *Gonda sign - flexing and suddenly releasing the 4th toe *Gordon sign - squeezing the calf muscle *Moniz sign - forceful passive plantar flexion of the ankle *Oppenheim sign - applying pressure to the medial side of the tibia *Schaeffer sign - squeezing the Achilles tendon * Silva sign - pinching the rectus femoris muscle *Stransky sign - vigorously abducting and suddenly releasing the little toe *Str√ºmpell sign - patient attempts to flex the knee against resistance *Throckmorton reflex - percussion over the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe  Abnormal reflexes seen as flexion of toes  *Bekhterev-Mendel reflex - flexion of the 2nd to 5th toes on percussion of the dorsum of the foot *Rossolimo sign - exaggerated flexion of the toes induced by rapid percussion on the tips of the toes References Category:Reflexes ","title":"Plantar reflex"},{"id":"562983","text":"Bol√≠var's campaign to liberate New Granada of 1819-1820 was part of the Colombian and Venezuelan wars of independence and was one of the many military campaigns fought by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Bol√≠var's victory in New Granada (today, Colombia) secured the eventual independence of northern South America. It provided Bol√≠var with the economic and human resources to complete his victory over the Spanish in Venezuela and Colombia. Bol√≠var's attack on New Granada is considered one of the most daring in military history, compared by contemporaries and some historians to Napoleon's crossing of the Alps in 1800 and Jos√© San Mart√≠n's Crossing of the Andes in 1817.Masur, Gerhard. Simon Bolivar, 273.Mijares, Augusto. The Liberator, 354. Background During the years 1815 and 1816, Spain had reconquered most of New Granada after five years of de facto and official independence. By 1817, Bol√≠var had set up his headquarters in the Orinoco region in southern Venezuela. It was an area from which the Spaniards could not easily oust him. There he engaged the services of several thousand foreign soldiers and officers, mostly British and Irish, set up his capital at Angostura (now Ciudad Bol√≠var) and established liaisons with the revolutionary forces of the Llanos, including one group of Venezuelan llaneros (cowboys) led by Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and another group of New Granadan exiles led by Francisco de Paula Santander. By 1819, Jos√© Mar√≠a Barreiro, who was in charge of the royalist troops in New Granada, counted with at least 4,500 trained soldiers at his command (without including the troops scattered throughout the region). Bolivar was able to round up merely 2,200 able men, which he distributed into four battalions, three regiments, one squadron, and an artillery company that lacked cannons. In the most part, Bolivar's soldiers were non-Spanish men, many of them recruited from the Venezuelan plains. Simon Bolivar's plan consisted of mobilizing his army from Venezuela to Casanare, in New Granada, to unite forces with Francisco de Paula Santander and his men, and infiltrate the territory through Tunja to combat the troops of Viceroy Ju√°n de S√°mano. The campaign Bol√≠var conceived of the operation in late 1818 and early 1819 after the Congress of Angostura began its deliberations and had reappointed him president of Venezuela. If Bol√≠var could liberate New Granada, he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Pablo Morillo, head of the royalist forces in the area. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment, therefore, was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bol√≠var decided to move during the rainy season, when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be gone from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bol√≠var's troops would be on the move. The proposed route, however, was considered impassable, and therefore the plan understandably received little support from the Congress or from P√°ez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the Apure and Meta River regions, Bol√≠var set off in June 1819.Lynch, John. Bol√≠var, A Life, 124-127.Masur, Gerhard. Simon Bolivar, 261-264.Madariaga, Salvador de. Bol√≠var, 339-343. Bol√≠var's troops cross the Cordillera Oriental The route that the small army of about 2,500 men‚Äîincluding a British legion‚Äîtook went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Venezuela to the icy mountain pass of the P√°ramo de Pisba, at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the Cordillera Oriental. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly llanero army was not prepared and poorly clothed for the cold and altitude of the mountains. Many became ill or died.Lynch, John. Bol√≠var, A Life, 127-129.Masur, Gerhard. Simon Bolivar, 264-266.Madariaga, Salvador de. Bol√≠var, 343-348. Despite some intelligence that Bol√≠var was on the move, the Spanish doubted Bol√≠var's army could make the trip, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bol√≠var's small army emerged from the mountains on 5 July. Bol√≠var rebuilt his forces by placing a levy on the local population. In a series of battles the republican army cleared its way to Bogot√°. First at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on 25 July, Bol√≠var intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. After the Vargas Swamp Battle, Bolivar reorganized his men, resting them until 4 August, when he ordered a return to Venezuela. However, in the night, he redirected his forces towards Tunja, and took the city by mid-day of 5 August 1819. Due to Bolivar's flash conquest, Barreiro was obliged to mobilize his troops to defend the capital, Santaf√©, from Bolivar. The Royalist men took the fastest route to Bogota (which led through the Boyac√° Bridge) but were unable to pass, as Bolivar intercepted them, early morning of 7 August. Bolivar's republican troops were composed of approximately 2,850 men, which successfully divided and defeated the 2,670 royalist soldiers in a battle that lasted two hours. The battle resulted in the death of 66 republicans, 250 royalists, as well as the capture of approximately 1,600 of the remaining royal troops. The Battle of Boyac√° on 7 August 1819, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bol√≠var. On the day of the battle of Boyac√°, Colonel Barrerio (leader of the royalist forces in Nueva Granada) was captured alongside 37 Spanish officers. The 38 prisoners were executed on 11 October 1819 by decree of Francisco de Paula Santander, keeping true to Bolivar's motto of 'war to the death.' On receiving the news, the viceroy, Juan Jos√© de S√°mano, and the rest of royalist government fled the capital to Cartagena de Indias so fast that they left behind the treasury. On the afternoon of 10 August Bol√≠var's army entered Bogot√° without any royalist resistance.Lynch, John. Bol√≠var, A Life, 129-130.Masur, Gerhard. Simon Bolivar, 266-73.Madariaga, Salvador de. Bol√≠var, 357-358. His arrival concluded the campaign for liberating Nueva Granada. The battle of Boyac√° was a decisive triumph over Spanish power in Nueva Granada, and the Spanish America as a whole. Despite the Royalists' strength in the other provinces of the region, such as Santa Marta and Pasto - where resistance would withstand various years of revolutionary uprisings - the capital of the viceroyalty of Nueva Granada had fallen in the hands of the New Granadans. Political ramifications With New Granada secure Bol√≠var returned to Venezuela, in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bol√≠var's success. In December Bol√≠var returned to Angostura, where he urged the Congress to proclaim the creation of a new state: the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It did so on 17 December and elected him president of the new country. Since two of its three regions, Venezuela and Quito (Ecuador), were still under royalist control, it was only a limited achievement.Lynch, John. Bol√≠var, A Life, 132-134.Masur, Gerhard. Simon Bolivar, 274-275, 280-285.Madariaga, Salvador de. Bol√≠var, 353-354, 361-364. Bol√≠var continued his efforts against the royalist areas of Venezuela, culminating in the Battle of Carabobo two years later, which all but secured his control of northern South America. Bol√≠var's victory in New Granada was, therefore, a major turning point in the history of northern South America. With this shift in political power, the path was laid out for the union of Nueva Granada and Venezuela into the Republic of Colombia. However, the campaigns for independence would continue: Antonio Jos√© de Sucre marched South, towards Pasto, the Audiencia de Quito, the Viceroyalty of Peru, and the Alto Per√∫, while Bolivar sought to expand the campaign to the westernmost regions of Venezuela, which still lay under Spanish power, and counted with 27,000 soldiers for its defense.

Udvar-Hazy Center Wiley Hardeman Post (November 22, 1898 - August 15, 1935) was a famed American aviator during the interwar period and the first pilot to fly solo around the world. Also known for his work in high-altitude flying, Post helped develop one of the first pressure suits and discovered the jet stream. On August 15, 1935, Post and American humorist Will Rogers were killed when Post's aircraft crashed on takeoff from a lagoon near Point Barrow in the Territory of Alaska. Post's Lockheed Vega aircraft, the Winnie Mae, was on display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center from 2003 to 2011. It is now featured in the \\"Time and Navigation\\" gallery on the second floor of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Early life Post was born to cotton farmer parents, William Francis and Mae Quinlan Post. His family moved to Oklahoma when he was five. He was an indifferent student, but managed to complete the sixth grade. By 1920, his family settled on a farm near Maysville, Oklahoma.Carlson. Erik D. \\"Post, Wiley Hardeman (1898‚Äì1935).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved: April 10, 2015. Young Wiley's first view of an aircraft in flight came in 1913 at the county fair in Lawton, Oklahoma. The plane was a Curtiss- Wright \\"Pusher type\\". The event so inspired him that he immediately enrolled in the Sweeney Automobile and Aviation School in Kansas City. Seven months later, he returned to Oklahoma and went to work at the Chickasaw and Lawton Construction Company. During World War I Post wanted to become a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service (USAS). Joining the training camp at the University of Oklahoma, he learned radio technology. Germany surrendered before he completed his training, the war ended, and he went to work as a \\"roughneck\\" in the Oklahoma oilfields. In October 1926, Post was badly injured in an oil-rig accident when a piece of metal pierced his left eye. An infection permanently blinded him in that eye, and he typically wore an eyepatch thereafter.Maranzini, Barbara, \\"Wiley Post Makes History,\\" History.com (July 22, 2013) https://www.history.com/news/wiley-post-makes-history The work was also unsteady, and he turned briefly to armed robbery. He was arrested in 1921 and sent to the Oklahoma State Reformatory. Serving more than a year in the Oklahoma State Reformatory, he was paroled in the summer of 1922. Early flying career Post's aviation career began at age 26 as a parachutist for a flying circus, Burrell Tibbs and His Texas Topnotch Fliers, and he became well known on the barnstorming circuit. On October 1, 1926, an oil field accident cost him his left eye, but he used the settlement money to buy his first aircraft. Around this time, he met fellow Oklahoman Will Rogers when he flew Rogers to a rodeo, and the two eventually became close friends. Post was the personal pilot of wealthy Oklahoma oilmen Powell Briscoe and F.C. Hall in 1930 when Hall bought a high-wing, single-engine Lockheed Vega, one of the most famous record-breaking aircraft of the early 1930s. The oilman nicknamed it the Winnie Mae after his daughter, and Post achieved his first national prominence in it by winning the National Air Race Derby, from Los Angeles to Chicago. The fuselage was inscribed, \\"Los Angeles to Chicago 9 hrs. 8 min. 2 sec. August 27, 1930.\\" Adam Charles Williams finished second with a time of 9 hrs. 9 min. 4 sec. Post earned a prize of $7,500. _Around the World in Eight Days_ by Wiley Post and Harold Gatty (1989, p.10) (The equivalent of $112,053 in 2020). Around the world Wiley Post with Harold Gatty in Germany, 1931 In 1930, the record for flying around the world was not held by a fixed-wing aircraft, but by the Graf Zeppelin, piloted by Hugo Eckener in 1929 with a time of 21 days. On June 23, 1931, Post and the Australian navigator Harold Gatty, left Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York, in the Winnie Mae with a flight plan that would take them around the world, stopping at Harbour Grace, Flintshire, Hanover twice, Berlin, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Blagoveshchensk, Khabarovsk, Nome, where his propeller had to be repaired, Fairbanks where the propeller was replaced, Edmonton, and Cleveland before returning to Roosevelt Field. They arrived back on July 1, after traveling in the record time of 8 days and 15 hours and 51 minutes, in the first successful aerial circumnavigation by a single-engined monoplane. The reception they received rivaled Charles Lindbergh's everywhere they went. They had lunch at the White House on July 7, rode in a ticker-tape parade the next day in New York City, and were honored at a banquet given by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America at the Hotel Astor. After the flight, Post acquired the Winnie Mae from F.C. Hall, and he and Gatty published an account of their journey titled, Around the World in Eight Days, with an introduction by Will Rogers. First solo pilot After the record-setting flight, Post wanted to open his own aeronautical school, but could not raise enough financial support because of doubts many had about his rural background and limited formal education. Motivated by his detractors, Post decided to attempt a solo flight around the world and to break his previous speed record. Over the next year, Post improved his aircraft by installing an autopilot device and a radio direction finder that were in their final stages of development by the Sperry Gyroscope Company and the United States Army. In 1933, he repeated his flight around the world, this time using the auto-pilot and compass in place of his navigator and becoming the first to accomplish the feat alone. He departed from Floyd Bennett Field and continued on to Berlin where repairs were attempted to his autopilot, stopped at K√∂nigsberg to replace some forgotten maps, Moscow for more repairs to his autopilot, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk for final repairs to the autopilot, Rukhlovo, Khabarovsk, Flat where his propeller had to be replaced, Fairbanks, Edmonton, and back to Floyd Bennett Field. Fifty thousand people greeted him on his return on July 22 after 7 days, 18 hours, 49 minutes.\\"Wiley H. Post\\". First Flight Society. Retrieved: June 23, 2020.Meunier, Claude. \\"WILEY POST\\".

Pressure suit Wiley Post in his third pressure suit In 1934, with financial support from Frank Phillips of the Phillips Petroleum Company, Post began exploring the limits of high-altitude long-distance flight. The Winnie Mae's cabin could not be pressurized, so he worked with Russell S. Colley of the B.F. Goodrich Company to develop what became the world's first practical pressure suit. Three pressure suits were fabricated for Wiley Post; only the final version proved successful. The first suit ruptured during a pressure test. The redesigned second suit used the same helmet as the first but when tested was too tight and they were unable to remove it from Post, so they had to cut him out thus destroying the suit. The third suit was redesigned from the previous two.Young 2009, pp. 13‚Äì16.Kozloski 1994, pp. 11‚Äì14. The body of the suit had three layers: long underwear, an inner black rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer layer made of rubberized parachute fabric. The outer layer was glued to a frame with arm and leg joints that allowed him to operate the flight controls and to walk to and from the aircraft. Attached to the frame were pigskin gloves, rubber boots, and an aluminum-and-plastic diver's helmet. The helmet had a removable faceplate that could be sealed at a height of 17,000 ft, and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The helmet was cylinder-shaped with a circular window. In the first flight using the suit on September 5, 1934, Post reached an altitude of 40,000 ft above Chicago. Eventually flying as high as 50,000 ft, Post discovered the jet stream and made the first major practical advances in pressurized flight.Mallan 1971, p. 31. As of 2011 the suit is currently being restored.\\"Wiley Post suit in Rocketry and Space Flight.\\" National Air & Space Museum via nasm.si.edu. Retrieved: July 18, 2010. Attempted high altitude non-stop transcontinental flights Cover flown by Wiley Post on all four of his attempts to make the first high altitude non-stop transcontinental flight from Los Angeles to New York. February‚ÄìJune 1935 Between February 22 and June 15, 1935, Post made four unsuccessful attempts to complete the first high altitude non-stop flight from Los Angeles to New York, all of which failed for various mechanical reasons. The first attempt on February 22 ended just 57.5 miles north of Los Angeles at Muroc, CA (Now Edwards AFB). This was followed by attempts on March 15 (Cleveland, Ohio; 2,035 miles), April 14 (Lafayette, Indiana; 1,760 miles), and June 15 (Wichita, KS; 1,188 miles). As the attempts were also meant to be the \\"First Air Mail Stratosphere Flight\\" over U.S. Air Mail Route #2 (AM-2) from Los Angeles to New York, Post also carried a quantity of 'cacheted' covers sponsored by Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc on all four flights. When Post was killed on August 15, 1935, thus ending the possibility of any more attempts to complete the AM-2 stratosphere flight, the covers were finally cancelled in Los Angeles on August 20, 1935, and forwarded to their addressees. Final flight and death Post with Will Rogers, August 1935 In 1935, Post became interested in surveying a mail-and-passenger air route from the West Coast of the United States to Russia. Short on cash, he built a hybrid using parts salvaged from two different aircraft: the fuselage of an airworthy Lockheed Orion and the wings of a wrecked experimental Lockheed Explorer. The Explorer wing was six feet longer in span than the Orion's original wing, an advantage that extended the range of the hybrid aircraft. As the Explorer wing did not have retractable landing gear, it also lent itself to the fitting of floats for landing in the lakes of Alaska and Siberia. Lockheed refused to make the modifications Post requested on the grounds that the two designs were incompatible and potentially a dangerous mix, so Wiley made the changes himself.Sterling 2001, p. 164. Post's friend Will Rogers visited him often at the airport in Burbank, California, while Pacific Airmotive Ltd. was modifying the aircraft,Sterling 2001, pp. 167‚Äì169. and asked Post to fly him through Alaska in search of new material for his newspaper column. When the floats Post had ordered were delayed, he used a set designed for a larger type, making the aircraft more nose-heavy than it already was.Johnson and Mohler. Wiley Post, His Winnie Mae, and the World's First Pressure Suit. p. 112. Retrieved: 3 April 2009. According to the research of Bryan Sterling, however, the floats were the correct type for the aircraft. After making a test flight in July, Post and Rogers left Lake Washington, near Seattle, in early August and made several stops in Alaska. While Post piloted the aircraft, Rogers wrote his columns on his typewriter. On August 15, they left Fairbanks, Alaska, for Point Barrow. They were a few miles from there when they became uncertain of their position in bad weather and landed in a lagoon to ask for directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft, uncontrollably nose-heavy at low speed, plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing, and ended up inverted in the shallow part. Both men died instantly.Sterling 2001, p. 246. Post is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery (section 48), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.History Ahead Honors and tributes In 1936, the Smithsonian Institution acquired the Winnie Mae from Post's widow for $25,000. Two monuments at the crash site commemorate the death of the two men and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nearby Wiley Post‚ÄìWill Rogers Memorial Airport located in Utqiagvik, Alaska bears their names. Wiley Post Airport, a large FAA designated reliever airport in Oklahoma City, is named after Post. Oklahoma City's major commercial airport is named after Will Rogers, so that both victims of the crash are honored by airports in Oklahoma City. The Will Rogers ‚Äì Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base is a seaplane base located on Lake Washington, at the north end of the Renton Municipal Airport in Renton, Washington. The U.S. Army Air Forces (later United States Air Force) named a street on the former Maywood Army Air Forces Specialized Storage Depot (later Cheli Air Force Station), after Post. No longer owned by the federal government, Wiley Post Road remains, connecting Bandini Boulevard and Lindbergh Lane in Bell, California. Post received the Distinguished Flying Cross (1932), the Gold Medal of Belgium (1934), and the International Harmon Trophy (1934). He was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1969. Post was inducted into the First Flight Society's First Flight Shrine, located at the Wright Brothers National Memorial, on December 17, 1970. In 1997, he was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum. In 1979, the United States Postal Service honored Post with two airmail stamps. Post was inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2004. For many years, The Wiley Post Commission, based in Oklahoma City, presented the annual Wiley Post Spirit Award to \\"an individual in general aviation who best exemplifies the innovative and pioneering spirit of Wiley Post.\\" Notes References Citations Bibliography * Johnson, Bobby H. \\"Post, Wiley Hardeman.\\" The Texas State Historical Association.
