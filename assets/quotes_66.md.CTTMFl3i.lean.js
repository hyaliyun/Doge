A graduate of the University of London and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he is best known as founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle publication TRACE, an international fashion and music title, and as a co-founder of the TRACE TV network. He runs TRUE Africa, a media platform championing young African voices, and TRUE, a content marketing agency, and is often involved in organizing international cultural exhibitions and events. In 2012, Grunitzky's career was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study,http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41383 which is taught in the \\"Power & Influence\\" MBA class.  Biography  Grunitzky was born in and grew up in the Togolese capital of Lomé. His greatuncle was Nicolas Grunitzky, former president of Togo. His paternal great-grandfather was Polish hence his surname. When Grunitzky was eight years old, his family left Togo for the United States, where his father had been appointed ambassador to Washington. Four years later, Grunitzky moved to France to study at the Catholic boarding school College de Juilly and, later, at the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris Sciences-Po. At the age of 20, Grunitzky moved to London after a year at Sciences Po, to pursue studies in economics at London University. It was there that he embarked on his career in journalism, meeting Jefferson Hack and writing for Dazed & Confused, The Big Issue and The Guardian. In 1995, at the age of 24, he launched TRUE magazine, which met with immediate critical success and was renamed TRACE a year later. In 1998, he uprooted to New York and oversaw the magazine as it carved a niche for itself in the world of independent publishing, with its own distinctive brand of transcultural reportage. As the magazine grew in influence, he co-founded TRUE Agency, a specialized advertising agency based in New York and Los Angeles. In February 2003, Grunitzky and business partners Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez completed a multimillion-dollar financing deal led by Goldman Sachs Group. As a result, the TRACE brand is now being leveraged globally across various television, mobile, event and interactive platforms. Grunitzky, a frequent contributor to the French weekly “Courrier International,” has worked as an associate producer on the BBC’s “The Works” series. He currently advises global corporations and governments in the fields of digital innovation and content strategy. In 2008, Grunitzky co-curated, with the cultural services of the French Embassy in the United States, the “I Kiffe NY” festival,http://www.frenchculture.org devoted to bringing the best of French urban culture to New York City. Grunitzky is also a board member of Humanity in Action,http://www.humanityinaction.org> a non-profit organization which works to build global leadership, defend democracy, protect minorities and improve human rights in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United States. In December 2013, Grunitzky became a director at the World Policy Institute,http://www.worldpolicy.org a non-partisan source of informed policy leadership. In January 2015, Grunitzky was elected to the board of trustees of avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson's http://www.robertwilson.com Watermill Center.http://www.watermillcenter.org In July 2017, he was appointed president of the organization.http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/07/claude-grunitzky-named-first- president-of-the-byrd-hoffman-water-mill-foundation/ In September 2016, Grunitzky was appointed Visiting Social Innovator at Harvard Kennedy School's Social Innovation + Change Initiative.http://sici.hks.harvard.edu In February 2017, Grunitzky was elected to the board of trustees of Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), one of the world’s liveliest centers for making and enjoying today’s most evocative art.http://www.massmoca.org As a Sloan Fellow at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Grunitzky earned an MBA. In November 2011, he was appointed a lecturer on \\"Thought Leadership\\" during MIT's Sloan Innovation Period. In September 2015, he officially announced the launch of his new venture, TRUE Africa . From 2017 to 2019, Grunitzky was the President of the Byrd Hoffman Water Mill Foundation, which operates The Watermill Center, an international center for the arts and humanities founded by Robert Wilson in 1991 on Long Island, New York. In 2019, Grunitzky was an Executive Producer, alongside Fernando Meirelles and the United Nations, of the feature length documentary The Great Green Wall, about an African-led movement with an epic ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder of the world across the entire width of Africa.http://www.greatgreenwall.org  Ventures  TRACE Magazine Born out of the short-lived TRUE magazine, TRACE was started by Grunitzky in London in 1996. Beginning life as predominantly an urban culture magazine, TRACE’s identity was quickly influenced by Grunitzky’s nascent interest in what he termed ‘transculturalism’ – a phenomenon referring to those individuals who, in their lifestyles, transcend all traditional sociological notions of race, class or gender.http://www.frenchculture.org/spip.php?article1772Transculturalim: How the World is Coming Together, by Claude Grunitzky (powerHouse, 2004) Although the magazine’s front pages continued to feature stellar figures from the hip hop and R&B; scenes, including Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige and Rihanna, the establishment of ‘country themed’ issues, beginning with ‘Brasil 2000’, marked a clear step in the direction of an explicitly international approach to popular culture. TRUE Agency In 2002, Grunitzky co-founded the TRUE, Agency, a marketing agency based in Los Angeles, in partnership with business partner Richard Wayner and the TBWA\\\\Worldwide group.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD8123CF93BA15751C0A9659C8B63 The agency currently operates out of London, Paris and New York. TRACE Television In 2003, Grunitzky also launched TRACE TV, the world’s first global urban music channel, with Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez, in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Groupe Lagardère. TRACE TV, which is now broadcast in over 150 countries, was successfully sold to European investors in July 2010, ending Grunitzky's involvement with the company. TRUE Africa Launched in September 2015, TRUE Africa is a media-tech platform focused on the next thinking on culture, music, sports, lifestyle, politics, fashion and tech in Africa and the diaspora. Grunitzky has stated that TRUE Africa's editors want to discover and champion young African voices all over the world. In 2017, TRUE Africa secured funding from Google's Digital News Initiative,http://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com which supports innovation in journalism.

Career Hu first became fascinated with metalwork during high school introductory courses. She later explored more work with metals during a summer camp. She went on to attend Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for two years and then went to Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan to complete her undergraduate degree. During her undergraduate education Hu developed her skills and continued to work with small scale metalwork and jewelry. In 1966 while earning her graduate degree in Metalsmithing from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, Hu studied under renowned metalsmith L. Brent Kington. It was during this time that Hu started to work with fiber inspired techniques after taking a fiber arts course. This led to the development of her signature style of wire wrapped jewelry. Since the late 1960s Hu has developed new techniques in coiling, wrapping, weaving, knitting, and twining wire. Her work consists mostly woven wire earrings, rings, bracelets, brooches, and neckpieces that emulate natural forms, movements and symmetry. After completing her MFA, Hu traveled to various places and took up different teaching positions until she joined the metal arts program in the University of Washington School of Art in 1980. She retired from the University as professor emeritus in 2006. Hu is a member and past-president of the Society of North American Goldsmiths. In 1996 Hu was inducted into the American Craft Council College of Fellows. Hu has received three National Endowment of the Arts Craftsman Fellowships. Her work is in major collections such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Renwick Gallery, the American Crafts Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago. Hu is the winner of the 2008 Irving and Yvonne Twining Humber Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement. Education1965: B.F.A.

She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in the non-canonical 2003 Clone Wars micro-series, voiced by Grey DeLisle. Ventress returned as a major antagonist in the 2008 The Clone Wars animated film and its subsequent television series, now voiced by Nika Futterman, though she eventually redeemed herself, becoming an anti-heroine. A powerful Dark Jedi with exceptional lightsaber combat abilities, Ventress wields dual lightsabers with curved handles that can attach together and form a double bladed weapon with a curve in the middle. Originally a Nightsister of Dathomir who was sold as a slave, she later became a Jedi Padawan, and eventually an informal Sith apprentice to Count Dooku after falling to the dark side of the Force as a result of her Jedi Master's death in battle. Trained as Dooku's personal assassin, Ventress was assigned various missions during the first years of the Clone Wars and came into conflict with the Jedi, primarily Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano. However, after being betrayed and left for dead by Dooku on the orders of his master, Darth Sidious, Ventress rejoined the Nightsisters and attempted to exact revenge on Dooku, before settling on becoming a bounty hunter. She later began to slowly redeem herself, helping her former Jedi enemies on several occasions, and was eventually completely redeemed the 2015 novel Star Wars: Dark Disciple, though Dooku killed her not long after. Aside from the television series, the character appears in several other forms of Star Wars media, both canon and non-canon, including books, comics, and video games. Ventress became a favorite among fans, regularly placing in fan polls and Star Wars character ranking lists. Characterization Asajj Ventress's original concept art = Creation = Before the character of Count Dooku was developed, the Art Department for Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones developed \\"a Sith villainess\\" by Dermot Power. When the Star Wars expanded universe resurrected this female Sith idea as one of Dooku's underlings who could appear more frequently throughout the Clone Wars, this nameless Separatist Commander was dubbed Juno Eclipse but the name was rejected as \\"not villainous enough\\", and she was renamed Asajj Ventress. The name Juno Eclipse was later given to a character featured in the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, with no relation to Ventress. LucasArts's Leland Chee suggested using \\"Asajj\\" as the character's first name, naming her after the character Asaji from Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood. = Portrayal = Asajj Ventress was voiced by Grey DeLisle in the 2003 Clone Wars micro-series, and by Nika Futterman in the 2008 animated film Star Wars: The Clone and its subsequent TV series, as well most of her video game and other animated appearances. Appearances =The Clone Wars= Ventress is an antagonist in the 2008 The Clone Wars film. As the disciple of Count Dooku, she helps him with his plan to turn Jabba the Hutt against the Galactic Republic by kidnapping his son Rotta. Ventress fights Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and apprentice Ahsoka Tano, who rescue Rotta, and later also battles Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who defeats her, forcing her to flee. Ventress is a lead character in all five broadcast seasons of the subsequent The Clone Wars animated series. In season one, Ventress travels to the moon of Rugosa as Dooku's emissary to form an alliance between the planet Toydaria and the Separatists. The king of Toydaria is reluctant, but allows her forces to face Yoda in battle to prove which side is superior. When the king decides to side with the Republic, Dooku gives his assassin permission to kill the king so they may have a better chance with the successor. Yoda thwarts her attempt, however, and she is forced to flee. Dooku orders Ventress to spy on the planet Kamino for the Separatist forces, planning an invasion with General Grievous to destroy the clone production facilities while stealing Jango Fett's DNA template from the production facility. Ventress then frees Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray from the custody of Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka, fighting the two Jedi before ultimately succeeding in her mission. In season three, Ventress' back story is explained: she hails from the planet Dathomir and was sold by the Nightsisters to criminals. She would have likely been killed in a pirate raid if not for Jedi Ky Narec, who had crashed on Rattatak. Narec sensed her potential and trained her in the ways of the Force. However, warlord Osika Kirske killed Narec before Ventress could become a full-fledged Jedi. She developed an implacable hatred of the Jedi Order, which she believes abandoned her master and ignored the bloodshed on her planet. Eventually, Darth Sidious comes to see Ventress as a liability, and orders Dooku to eliminate her. Dooku attempts, unsuccessfully, to kill her, as she engages Anakin and Obi-Wan in one final duel, in which she is wounded. She turns to the Nightsisters of Dathomir for help, and they engineer Savage Opress to serve as Dooku's new apprentice in order to earn his trust, before ultimately killing him on Ventress' behalf. The scheme fails, however, when Opress turns on both Dooku and Ventress and attempts to kill them both. In season four, Ventress returns to the Nightsisters. She undergoes the ritual to become a full-fledged Nightsister, but is thwarted when Grievous' droid army slaughter the Nightsisters while their matriarch Mother Talzin is rendered incorporeal. Told by Talzin to find her own path, Ventress later helps Boba Fett's team of bounty hunters in a dangerous but profitable mission. She then finally makes peace with her past with an ideal future as a bounty hunter. While still haunted by Opress, she tracks him to Raydonia to collect a bounty on him. When she arrives on Opress’ spaceship, she confronts him and Darth Maul as they are about to kill Obi-Wan. Ventress teams up with her old nemesis to fight Maul and Opress, but they are ultimately forced to escape in their shuttle. In season five's final arc, Ventress nearly apprehends Ahsoka, who has been framed for attempting to destroy the Jedi Temple. She ultimately helps Ahsoka escape on the condition that she would be exonerated. Ventress later tells Anakin that Barriss Offee framed Ahsoka. In the 2015 novel Dark Disciple, based on unfinished episodes from season seven, Ventress teams up with renegade Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos in order to kill Dooku, and falls in love with him. When Vos is turned to the dark side by Dooku, Ventress manages to redeem him, but she is killed by Dooku with Force lightning shortly after. Vos later returns Ventress' body to Dathomir so that she may rejoin her fallen sisters in spirit. =Legends works= With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. Clone Wars Star Wars: Clone Wars. Asajj Ventress first appeared as a supporting villain in the 2003 micro-series Star Wars: Clone Wars. When Sith Lord Count Dooku arrives to add the planet Rattatak to his Separatist movement, he witnesses Ventress fighting several opponents in a large arena, defeating them all before claiming to be a Sith warrior. When Dooku laughs aside the notion that she could be a Sith, Ventress tries to attack him, but the Sith Lord renders her unconscious with Force lightning. After she awakens, Dooku attacks her again, but she jumps backwards and ignites her lightsabers. In her quarters, a short duel takes place to which Dooku cuts her two lightsabers in half, rendering her defenseless. Although Ventress is defeated, Dooku is impressed by her abilities and recruits her to be his apprentice by appealing to her hatred of the Jedi. Darth Sidious later personally assigns Ventress to kill Anakin Skywalker, and Dooku presents the Dark Jedi with a new pair of lightsabers with curved hilts. After Ventress leaves, Sidious remarks that she is certain to fail, but that she will serve as a useful test for Anakin. Ventress then engages the Republic fighter forces in orbit of the planet Muunilinst and lures Anakin into a chase. Ventress and Anakin go to Yavin IV, and a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple takes place. Though she initially gains the upper hand in their duel, Anakin calls upon his immense connection to the Force and brutally overpowers her, causing her to fall over the edge of a cliff. Novels As portrayed in the novel The Cestus Deception, Ventress appears on Ord Cestus during the Bio-Droid Crisis. She is behind the X'Ting criminal Trillot's dealings with Obi-Wan. Ventress also destroys the Republic Cruiser carrying Barrister Doolb Snoil returning to the Republic; however, Snoil survives. Ventress later challenges Kenobi and his fellow Jedi Master Kit Fisto to a duel. Ventress disarms Fisto but is then engaged by Kenobi. Their duel leads them into an underwater chamber and Ventress is forced to escape after Kenobi slices her across her abdomen. She lets loose a smoke bomb and flees back to the Confederacy and Dooku. Comic books In the Star Wars: Republic story \\"The New Face of War\\", Ventress joins forces with the bounty hunter Durge on the invasion of Naboo's moon, Ohma-D'un. Together they use swamp gas to wipe out the Gungan colony and prepare to launch a biological attack on Naboo. In the ensuing battle with Republic forces, Ventress makes her first public appearance in the war (in the chronological timeline). Ventress kills Jedi Master Glaive in the battle and cuts off his apprentice Zule's left arm. She engages Obi-Wan and the pair are evenly matched. Ventress escapes with Durge after ARC Trooper Alpha destroys their fueling station. In Star Wars: Jedi - Mace Windu, Dooku sends Ventress to Ruul to help frame Mace Windu. Ventress briefly confronts Sora Bulq, who had been secretly corrupted by Dooku, as a ruse. Ventress kills Mira in the battle and then engages Jedi Masters Sian Jeisel, K' Kruhk and Rhad Tarn all of whom she defeats singlehandedly. After framing Windu for the crime, Ventress corrupts Tarn. While Tarn fights against Jeisel, Ventress defeats K'Kruhk in combat. Windu's timely arrival saves the Jedi; Ventress finds that she is no match for Windu's power and is forced to flee.

Obi-Wan unleashes a rancor to distract Ventress, but she manipulates it via the dark side. Obi-Wan fights Ventress after killing the rancor but he escapes with Vos before the duel is settled. Grievous arrives to rescue the two Dark Jedi, shaming Ventress in their master Dooku's eyes. Ventress then travels to Coruscant to kill Vos and Obi-Wan. During the mission, she discovers Anakin's secret marriage to Senator Padmé Amidala. Enraged, Anakin engages Ventress. During the duel, Ventress scars Skywalker's face but she is once again overpowered and suffers another huge fall. Republic Intelligence assumes that she is dead. \\"Obsession\\" marks the character's final appearance in Republic. Ventress survives her encounter with Anakin on Coruscant but is badly injured. She is sent to Boz Pity where Dooku places her in a bacta tank and fits her with cybernetic modifications. One month later, Obi-Wan infiltrates the facility. Ventress wakes up and subsequently attacks him. She fights against both Obi- Wan and Anakin but is abandoned when Dooku orders an IG-100 MagnaGuard to kill her as she runs towards Dooku's shuttle. Enraged and badly wounded, Ventress tries to kill Obi-Wan as he tries to help her. Anakin slashes her from behind, mortally wounding her. As she lies dying, she tells him the location of the Separatists' next target. Believing Ventress to be dead, Obi-Wan puts her on a ship bound for Coruscant.

Print At the Old Vic, Guinness worked with many actors and actresses who would become his friends and frequent co-stars in the future, including Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, Anthony Quayle, and Jack Hawkins. An early influence was film star Stan Laurel, whom Guinness admired.On 3 June 1961, Guinness sent a letter to Stan Laurel , acknowledging that he must have unconsciously modeled his portrayal of Sir Andrew Aguecheek as he imagined Laurel might have done. Guinness was 23 at the time he was performing in Twelfth Night, so this would have been around 1937, by which time Laurel had become an international movie star. Guinness continued playing Shakespearean roles throughout his career. In 1937, he played Aumerle in Richard II and Lorenzo in The Merchant of Venice under the direction of John Gielgud. He starred in a 1938 production of Hamlet which won him acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. He also appeared as Romeo in a production of Romeo and Juliet (1939), Malvolio in Twelfth Night, and as Exeter in Henry V in 1937, both opposite Laurence Olivier, and Ferdinand in The Tempest, opposite Gielgud as Prospero. In 1939, he adapted Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations for the stage, playing Herbert Pocket. The play was a success. One of its viewers was a young British film editor, David Lean, who would later have Guinness reprise his role in Lean's 1946 film adaptation of the play. Second World War Guinness served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in the Second World War, initially as a seaman in 1941, before receiving a commission as a temporary Sub-lieutenant on 30 April 1942 and a promotion to Temporary Lieutenant the following year.Houterman, J.N. \\"Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) Officers 1939–1945\\", Unithistories.com; retrieved 7 March 2010.

Another role which is sometimes referred to as one which he considered his best, and is so considered by many critics, is that of Colonel Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960). Guinness also played the role of Jamessir Bensonmum, the blind butler, in the 1976 Neil Simon film Murder by Death. =David Lean= Guinness with Rita Tushingham in Doctor Zhivago (1965) Guinness won particular acclaim for his work with director David Lean, which today is his most critically acclaimed work. After appearing in Lean's Great Expectations and Oliver Twist, he was given a starring role opposite William Holden in The Bridge on the River Kwai. For his performance as Colonel Nicholson, the unyielding British POW commanding officer, Guinness won an Academy Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Despite a difficult and often hostile relationship, Lean, referring to Guinness as \\"my good luck charm\\", continued to cast Guinness in character roles in his later films: Arab leader Prince Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia; the title character's half-brother, Bolshevik leader Yevgraf, in Doctor Zhivago and Indian mystic Professor Godbole in A Passage to India. He was also offered a role in Lean's Ryan's Daughter (1970) but declined. At that time, Guinness \\"mistrusted\\" Lean and considered the formerly close relationship to be strained—although, at his funeral, he recalled that the famed director had been \\"charming and affable\\". Guinness appeared in five Lean films that were ranked in the British Film Institute's top 50 greatest British films of the 20th century: 3rd (Lawrence of Arabia), 5th (Great Expectations), 11th (The Bridge on the River Kwai), 27th (Doctor Zhivago) and 46th (Oliver Twist).British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films (1999).

In letters to his friends, Guinness described the film as \\"fairy tale rubbish\\" but the film's sense of moral good – and the studio's doubling of his initial salary offer – appealed to him and he agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film.Selim, Jocelyn. \\"Alec Guinness: Reluctant Intergalactic Icon.\\" Cancer Today magazine, Spring 2012. He negotiated a deal for 2.25% of the gross royalties paid to the director, George Lucas, who received one-fifth of the box office takings. This made him very wealthy in his later life. Upon his first viewing of the film, Guinness wrote in his diary, \\"It's a pretty staggering film as spectacle and technically brilliant. Exciting, very noisy and warm-hearted. The battle scenes at the end go on for five minutes too long, I feel, and some of the dialogue is excruciating and much of it is lost in noise, but it remains a vivid experience.\\" Guinness soon became unhappy with being identified with the part and expressed dismay at the fan following that the Star Wars trilogy attracted. In the DVD commentary of the original Star Wars, Lucas says that Guinness was not happy with the script rewrite in which Obi-Wan is killed. Guinness said in a 1999 interview that it was actually his idea to kill off Obi-Wan, persuading Lucas that it would make him a stronger character and that Lucas agreed to the idea. Guinness stated in the interview, \\"What I didn't tell Lucas was that I just couldn't go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines. I'd had enough of the mumbo jumbo.\\" He went on to say that he \\"shrivelled up\\" every time Star Wars was mentioned to him.\\"Alec Guinness Blasts Jedi 'Mumbo Jumbo'\\", 8 September 1999. Although Guinness disliked the fame that followed work he did not hold in high esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, on and off the set. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him \\"no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live for the rest of my life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me.\\" In his autobiography, Blessings in Disguise, Guinness tells an imaginary interviewer \\"Blessed be Star Wars\\", regarding the income it provided. In 2003, Obi-Wan Kenobi as portrayed by Guinness was selected as the 37th-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Digitally altered archival audio of Guinness's voice was used in the films Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Television appearances Guinness was reluctant to appear on television, but accepted the part of George Smiley in the serialisation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) after meeting the author. Guinness reprised the role in Smiley's People (1982), and twice won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the character.

From the 1950s the family lived at their home Kettlebrook Meadows, near Steep Marsh in Hampshire. The house itself was designed by Merula's brother Eusty Salaman. In his biography, Alec Guinness: The Unknown, Garry O'Connor reports that Guinness was arrested and fined 10 guineas (£10.50) for a homosexual act in a public lavatory in Liverpool in 1946. Guinness is said to have avoided publicity by giving his name to police and court as \\"Herbert Pocket\\", the name of the character he played in Great Expectations.

In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child apparently did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but took his hand and chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor.\\"Sir Alec Guinness.\\" Telegraph (Obituaries), 8 August 2000.

It comes from South Africa, especially in the Cape Province. Sometimes referred to as a Baseball plant. In the wild it is endangered because of over- collection and poaching, combined with its slow growth, and the fact that the pod contains only 2 to 3 seeds. However, it is widely cultivated in botanical gardens. Description Euphorbia obesa resembles a ball, thornless and decorative. It is commonly known as 'baseball plant' due to its shape. Its diameter is between 6 cm and 15 cm depending on its age. Young Euphorbia obesas are spherical, but become cylindrical with age. They contain water reservoirs for periods of drought. It almost always shows 8 ridges adorned with small deep gibbosity regularly planted on the edges. It is green with horizontal lighter or darker stripes. In the wild, and with exposure to direct sunlight, it shows red and purple areas. The plant is dioecious, which means that a subject has only male or female flowers. The small flowers are insignificant in apex. In fact, like all Euphorbia, flowers are called cyathia. As in all Euphorbia species, the latex is toxic. Living in similar conditions on two different continents, Euphorbia obesa presents a form of convergence with Astrophytum asterias which is a cactus from Mexico. Distribution This species is indigenous to a small range in the arid Karoo region of South Africa. This is a region of summer rainfall. Cultivation In cultivation in the UK, Euphorbia obesa has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

At approximately 9:45 AM, prison staff placed the mailbags on a pallet, transported it to a nearby warehouse outside the prison's perimeter fence, and went for lunch. McNair then cut himself out of the pod and escaped at 11:00 AM. Having observed prison operations and the times when prisoner counts were conducted, McNair knew that his absence would not be discovered until 4:00 PM. After an over yearlong manhunt, McNair was captured in New Brunswick, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Oct. 25, 2007 after being featured on the television program Americas Most Wanted.Christopher, Byron. \\"Richard Lee McNair Breaks His Silence\\" .

He is a large, slug-like alien known as a Hutt who, like many others of his species, operates as a powerful crime lord within the galaxy. He is notable for never speaking Basic, the main characters' language, though able to understand it, always replying in the constructed language Huttese. In the original theatrical releases of the original Star Wars trilogy, Jabba the Hutt first appeared in Return of the Jedi (1983). However, he is mentioned in Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and, indirectly, in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), while a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt was added to the 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media releases of Star Wars. When first shot, this scene featured Declan Mulholland as a humanoid version of Jabba speaking the main character's language, which was digitally superimposed over with the character's monstrous current design when the footage was reincorporated into the film. In Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Jabba appears in a sequence recreated in CGI. In the storyline context of the original trilogy, Jabba is introduced as the most powerful crime boss on Tatooine, who has placed a bounty on the head of heroic smuggler Han Solo and employs bounty hunters such as Greedo and Boba Fett to capture or kill him. When confronted at his home palace after managing to capture Solo, Jabba is seen surrounded by a large host of extraterrestrial acquaintances, such as various fellow criminals, entertainers such as the Max Rebo Band, and slave girls, one of which Princess Leia is briefly made before ultimately killing her captor in the midst of a climactic battle sequence. Jabba is portrayed as a cruel antagonist with a grim sense of humor, an insatiable appetite (as is typical of his species), and affinities for torture and other heinous activities. The character has incorporated prominently into Star Wars merchandising beginning with the marketing campaign corresponding with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the canonical films, Jabba the Hutt is additionally featured in various pieces of Star Wars Legends literature. Since his appearance in Return of the Jedi, Jabba the Hutt's image has been highly influential and recognizable in contemporary popular culture, commonly being used as a satirical literary device and/or political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as morbid obesity, corruption and corporate greed. Appearances Jabba the Hutt appears in three of the nine live-action Star Wars films (The Phantom Menace, A New Hope and Return of the Jedi) and The Clone Wars. He has a recurring role in Star Wars expanded universe literature and stars in the comic book anthology Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal (1998), a collection of comics originally published in 1995 and 1996. =Star Wars films= Jabba was first seen in 1983 in Return of the Jedi, the third installment of the original Star Wars trilogy. Directed by Richard Marquand and written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, the first act of Return of the Jedi features the attempts of Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the Wookiee Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rescue their friend, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who had been imprisoned in carbonite in the previous film, The Empire Strikes Back. The captured Han is delivered to Jabba by the bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) and placed on display in the crime lord's throne room as a decoration. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Leia, and Chewbacca infiltrate Jabba's palace to save Han. Leia is able to free Han from the carbonite, but she is caught and enslaved by the Hutt. Chained to Jabba, she is forced to wear her iconic metal bikini. Luke arrives to \\"bargain for Solo's life\\", but Jabba rejects his offer and attempts to feed him to his pet rancor, an enormous monster. Luke kills the rancor, and he, Han, and Chewbacca are condemned to be devoured by the Sarlacc. At the Great Pit of Carkoon, Luke escapes execution with the help of R2-D2, and defeats Jabba's guards. During the subsequent confusion, Leia chokes Jabba to death with the chain she was tethered to his throne with. Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 escape, and Jabba's sail barge explodes over the Sarlacc pit in the background. The second film appearance of Jabba the Hutt was in the Special Edition of Star Wars, which was released in 1997 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its release. Here (as in the original version), Han Solo disputes with the alien bounty hunter Greedo (Paul Blake and Maria De Aragon), whom he kills, and Jabba confirms Greedo's last words and demands that Han pay the value of the payload lost by him. Han promises to compensate Jabba as soon as he receives payment for delivering Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO to Alderaan. Jabba agrees, but threatens to place a big price on Solo's head if he fails. This was an unfinished scene of the original 1977 film, in which Jabba was played by Declan Mulholland in human form. In the 1997 Special Edition version of the film, a CGI rendering of Jabba replaces Mulholland, and his voice is redubbed in the fictional language of Huttese.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Special Edition, dir. George Lucas (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2005), disc 1. Jabba the Hutt made his third film appearance in the 1999 prequel, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, set 36 years before Return of the Jedi. Jabba gives the order to begin a podrace at Mos Espa on Tatooine. With this done, Jabba falls asleep, and misses the race's conclusion.\\"Mos Espa Grand Arena\\" at the Star Wars Databank.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, dir. George Lucas (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 1999), disc 1. Jabba is mentioned in the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) by Han Solo's mentor Tobias Beckett, who invites Han to join a big shot gangster for putting together a crew. At the end of the movie, Han and Chewie decide to go to Tatooine for this job. =The Clone Wars= Jabba figures into the plot of the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, wherein his son Rotta is captured by Separatists; Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter) and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) return him to Jabba in exchange for the safe passage of Republic ships through his territory. Jabba subsequently appeared in a handful of episodes of The Clone Wars series, starting in the third season. In the episode \\"Sphere of Influence\\", wherein Jabba is faced by Chairman Papanoida, whose daughters were kidnapped by Greedo, Jabba allows a sample of Greedo's blood to be taken to prove him the kidnapper. In the episode \\"Evil Plans\\", Jabba hires the bounty hunter Cad Bane (voiced by Corey Burton) to bring him plans for the Senate building. When Bane returns successful, Jabba and the Hutt Council send Bane to free Jabba's uncle Ziro from prison. Jabba next makes a short appearance in the episode \\"Hunt for Ziro\\" in which he is seen laughing at his uncle's death at the hand of Sy Snootles (voiced by Nika Futterman), and pays her for delivering Ziro's holo- diary. In the fifth season episode \\"Eminence\\", Jabba and the Hutt Council are approached by Shadow Collective leaders Darth Maul (voiced by Sam Witwer), Savage Opress (voiced by Clancy Brown), and Pre Vizsla (voiced by Jon Favreau); when disappointed by these, Jabba sends bounty hunters Embo (voiced by Dave Filoni), Dengar (voiced by Simon Pegg), Sugi (voiced by Anna Graves), and Latts Razzi (voiced by Clare Grant) to capture them. After a battle, the Shadow Collective confront Jabba at his palace on Tatooine, where Jabba agrees to an alliance. Other appearances =Expanded Universe= Jabba as he appears in Marvel Comics' adaptation of the first Star Wars film. The first released appearances of Jabba the Hutt in any visual capacity were in Marvel Comics' adaptation of A New Hope. In Six Against the Galaxy (1977) by Roy Thomas, What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut? (1979) and In Mortal Combat (1980), both by Archie Goodwin, Jabba the Hutt (originally spelled Hut) appeared as a tall humanoid with a walrus-like face, a topknot, and a bright uniform. The official \\"Jabba\\" was not yet established as he had yet to be seen. While awaiting the sequel to Star Wars, Marvel kept the monthly comic going with their own stories, one of which includes Jabba tracking Han Solo and Chewbacca down to an old hideaway they use for smuggling. However, circumstances force Jabba to lift the bounty on Solo and Chewbacca, thus enabling them to return to Tatooine for an adventure with Luke Skywalker—who has returned to the planet in order to recruit more pilots for the Rebel Alliance. In the course of another adventure, Solo kills the space pirate Crimson Jack and busts up his operation, which Jabba bankrolled. Jabba thus renews the reward for Solo's head. Solo later kills a bounty hunter who tells him why he is hunted once more. He and Chewbacca return to the Rebels. (Solo mentions an incident with a \\"bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell\\" in The Empire Strikes Back.) The Marvel artists based this Jabba on a character later named Mosep Binneed, an alien visible only briefly in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene of A New Hope.. The 1977 mass-market paperback novelization of Lucas's Star Wars script describes Jabba as a \\"great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skull\\", but gives no further detail as to the character's physical appearance or species. Later Star Wars novels and comics adopt a version of the character's image as seen in the film and greatly elaborate on his background and activities prior to the events of the Star Wars films. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, all literature in this category was rebranded as Star Wars Legends and designated as non-canonical to any and all new media released after April 2014. Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (1992), a young-adult novel by Paul and Hollace Davids, identifies Jabba's father as another powerful crime lord named Zorba and reveals that Jabba was born 596 years before the events of A New Hope, making him around 600 years old at the time of his death in Return of the Jedi. Four comics exploring Jabba's backstory were written by Jim Woodring and released by Dark Horse Comics in 1995–96; these were collected as Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal in 1998. Ann C. Crispin's novel The Hutt Gambit (1997) explains how Jabba and Han Solo become business associates and portrays the events that lead to a bounty being placed on Han's head. Tales from Jabba's Palace (1996), a collection of short stories edited by Kevin J. Anderson, pieces together the lives of Jabba the Hutt's various minions in his palace and their relationship to him during the last days of his life. These stories reveal that very few of the Hutt's servants are loyal to him, with many plans underway among their ranks to attempt his assassination. When Jabba the Hutt is killed in Return of the Jedi, his surviving former courtiers join forces with his rivals on Tatooine and his family on the Hutt homeworld Nal Hutta make claims to his palace, fortune, and criminal empire. Timothy Zahn's novel Heir to the Empire (1991) reveals that a smuggler named Talon Karrde eventually replaces Jabba as the \\"big fish in the pond\\", and moves the headquarters of the Hutt's criminal empire off of Tatooine. =Potential film project= Lucas has noted that there was a potential role for Jabba in future Star Wars films. In August 2017, a Jabba the Hutt anthology film was reportedly in development alongside an Obi-Wan Kenobi film. Although no cast or crew have been announced, Guillermo del Toro has expressed interest in directing such a project.  Characterization  Jabba the Hutt exemplifies lust, greed, and gluttony.

Retrieved November 9, 2019. who amuses himself by torturing and humiliating his subjects and enemies. He surrounds himself with scantily-clad slave girls of all species, chained to his dais. The Star Wars Databank remarks that residents of his palace are not safe from his desire to dominate and torture: in Return of the Jedi, the Twi'lek slave dancer Oola is fed to the rancor. Jabba the Hutt's physical appearance reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant. In Return of the Jedi, Han Solo calls Jabba a \\"slimy piece of worm-ridden filth\\". Film critic Roger Ebert described him as \\"a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat.\\" Curiously, the Russian word for \\"toad\\" sounds very close to \\"Jabba\\". Science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos wrote that Jabba deserved the \\"award for most disgusting alien\\". Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch write that Jabba's body is a \\"miasmic mass\\", and that \\"The Hutt's lardaceous body seemed to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench\\" into the air. Jabba's appetite is insatiable, and some authors portray him threatening to eat his subordinates. Among Jabba's only displays of any positive qualities within the franchise occur in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, where he demonstrates genuine affection for his son Rotta and is worried by his kidnapping and angered by his supposed death. In one Expanded Universe story, Jabba prevents a Chevin named Ephant Mon from freezing to death on an ice planet, whereafter Ephant Mon becomes one of his most loyal servants.  Concept and creation  = Episode IV: A New Hope = The original script to Star Wars describes Jabba as a \\"fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth\\", but Lucas stated in an interview that the initial character he had in mind was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee. When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed Northern Irish actor Declan Mulholland to stand- in for Jabba the Hutt, wearing a shaggy brown costume. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion creature. The scene was meant to connect Star Wars to Return of the Jedi and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of The Empire Strikes Back.George Lucas interview, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Special Edition (VHS, 20th Century Fox, 1997). Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget and time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film's plot.George Lucas commentary, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Special Edition, dir. George Lucas, (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004). The scene remained in the novelization, comic book, and radio adaptations of the film. Harrison Ford (left) and Declan Mulholland, Jabba the Hutt's original actor, in an uncompleted scene from A New Hope in 1976 Lucas revisited the scene in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete.Joseph Letteri interview, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Special Edition (VHS, 20th Century Fox, 1997).\\"A New Hope: Special Edition — What has changed?: Jabba the Hutt\\", January 15, 1997, at .

The solution was to have Solo step on Jabba's tail, causing him to grunt in pain. In the 2004 DVD release, Jabba reacts more strongly, winding up as if to punch Han. In this version, shadows of Han can be seen on Jabba's body to make the CGI more convincing. Lucas confesses that people were disappointingly upset about the CGI Jabba's appearance, complaining that the character \\"looked fake\\". Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is ultimately portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, it will always be \\"fake\\" since the character is ultimately not real. He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer.George Lucas commentary, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Special Edition, dir. Richard Marquand (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004). = Episode VI: Return of the Jedi = Concept artwork of Jabba the Hutt for Return of the Jedi designed by Industrial Light & Magic Image of Bibendum. Figure used is at viewer's right Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, \\"In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature.\\"Ralph McQuarrie, quoted in Laurent Bouzereau, Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays (New York: Del Rey, 1997), p. 239, . According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of the character. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the \\"Michelin Man\\").From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga, narrated by Mark Hamill (1985; VHS, CBS Fox Video, 1992). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, > My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him > as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. > But Phil Tippett kept imagining him as some kind of slug, almost like in > Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a > slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually > that's where it led up to.\\"Nilo Rodis-Jamero, quoted in Bouzereau, Annotated > Screenplays, p. 239. =Production and design= Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey, even a humanoid. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction. In Return of the Jedi, Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. The tongue was a light beige color and came out of Jabba’s mouth several times. When he encountered Leia Organa for the first time and enslaved her, he extended his tongue and licked at her face. The reason Leia reacted with such disgust upon seeing the tongue, was because in one take, Philpott moved the tongue closer then Carrie Fisher was comfortable with, and it licked her unintentionally. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control. Design of the Jabba the Hutt puppet for Return of the Jedi Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's appearance and immobility, complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope. Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, whose work is not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth.Ben Burtt commentary, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Special Edition, dir. Richard Marquand (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004). Jabba the Hutt's musical theme throughout the film, composed by John Williams, is played on a tuba. The theme is very similar to one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's soundtrack album. Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan, who says Williams' piece \\"blends the monstrous and the lyrical.\\" According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's death in Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from The Godfather (1972) where an obese character named Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) is garroted by an assassin. =Portrayal= Jabba the Hutt was played by Declan Mulholland in scenes cut from the 1977 release of Star Wars. In Mulholland's scenes as Jabba, Jabba is represented as a rotund human dressed in a shaggy fur coat. George Lucas has stated his intention was to use an alien creature for Jabba, but the special effects technology of the time was not up to the task of replacing Mulholland. In 1997, the \\"Special Edition\\" re-releases restored and altered the original scene to include a computer generated portrayal of Jabba. In Return of the Jedi, he was played by puppeteers Mike Edmonds, Toby Philpott, David Alan Barclay and voiced by Larry Ward. Jabba was voiced by an unknown actor in post-1997 editions of Star Wars and in The Phantom Menace. In The Phantom Menace end credits, Jabba was jokingly credited as playing himself. His puppeteers have appeared in the documentaries From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga and Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi. David Alan Barclay, who was one of the puppeteers for Jabba in the film, voiced Jabba in the Super NES video game adaptation of Return of the Jedi. In the radio drama adaption of the original trilogy, Jabba is played by Ed Asner. In the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the following television series, Jabba is portrayed by Kevin Michael Richardson. All other video game appearances of Jabba were played by Clint Bajakian. Jabba was supposed to appear in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, but was left out due to time constraints. A cutscene was produced featuring a conversation between Jabba and Juno Eclipse (voiced by Nathalie Cox), which was scrapped from the game. He appears in the Ultimate Sith Edition. Cultural impact With the premiere of Return of the Jedi in 1983 and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt became an icon of not just Star Wars, but American popular culture as a whole. The character was produced and marketed as a series of action figure play sets by Kenner/Hasbro from 1983 to 2004. A complete Jabba the Hutt play set sold by Kenner in 1983 was valued at $70 in 2003 by collectors if in mint condition and with original packaging. In the 1990s, Jabba the Hutt starred in his own comic book series, Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal (a reference to the book of the same title by Donald Trump). Jabba's role in popular culture extends beyond the Star Wars universe and its fans. In Mel Brooks' Star Wars spoof film Spaceballs (1987), Jabba the Hutt is parodied as the character Pizza the Hutt, a cheesy blob shaped like a slice of pizza whose name is a double pun on Jabba the Hutt and the restaurant franchise Pizza Hut. Like Jabba, Pizza the Hutt is a loan shark and mobster. The character meets his demise at the end of Spaceballs when he becomes \\"locked in his car and [eats] himself to death.\\"Spaceballs, Dir. Mel Brooks (MGM, 1987). The Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, included a display on Jabba the Hutt in the temporary exhibition Star Wars: The Magic of Myth, which closed in 1999. Jabba's display was called \\"The Hero's Return,\\" referencing Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi.. =Mass media= Since the release of Return of the Jedi, the name Jabba the Hutt has become synonymous in American mass media with repulsive obesity. The name is utilized as a literary device—either as a simile or metaphor—to illustrate character flaws. For example, in Under the Duvet (2001), Marian Keyes references a problem with gluttony when she writes, \\"wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on.\\" Likewise, in the novel Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize the weight of a character's father: \\"The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookiee. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those terms.\\" In Dan Brown's first novel Digital Fortress, an NSA technician is affectionately nicknamed Jabba the Hutt. In his book of humor and popular culture The Dharma of Star Wars (2005), writer Matthew Bortolin attempts to show similarities between Buddhist teachings and aspects of Star Wars fiction. Bartolin insists that if a person makes decisions that Jabba the Hutt would make, then that person is not practicing the proper spiritual concept of dharma. Bortolin's book reinforces the idea that Jabba's name is synonymous with negativity: > One way to see if we are practicing right livelihood is to compare our trade > with that of Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has his fat, stubby fingers in many of > the pots that led to the dark side. He dealt largely in illegal \\"spice\\" > trade—an illicit drug in the Star Wars galaxy. He also transacts business in > the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, > a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon. Jabba uses deception > and violence to maintain his position. Outside literature, the character's name has become an insulting term of disparagement. To say that someone \\"looks like Jabba the Hutt\\" is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person's weight or appearance. The term is often employed by the media as an attack on prominent figures. In another sense of the term, Jabba the Hutt has come to represent greed and anarchy, especially in the business world. Jabba the Hutt ranked #4 on the Forbes Fictional 15 list of wealthiest fictional characters in 2008. Jabba the Hutt has likewise become a popular means of caricature in American politics. William G. Ouchi uses the term to describe what he sees as the inefficient bureaucracy of the public school system: \\"With all of these unnecessary layers of organizational fat, school districts have come to resemble Jabba the Hutt—the pirate leader in Star Wars.\\"Ouchi, William G. Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), p. 96. References Footnotes Citations Further reading Mangels, Andy.

He is currently the pitching coach for the collegiate Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball team. Career =College career= Prior to playing professional baseball, Hayward attended the University of Oklahoma. In 1980, he went 9-2 with a 3.19 ERA and 78 strikeouts in 93 innings of work. The following year, he went 9–2 with a 1.70 ERA, striking out 75 batters in 69 innings. He appeared in only three games in 1982, going 1–1 with a 2.40 ERA. In his final college season – 1983 – he went 7–6 with a 3.40 ERA and 125 strikeouts in 98 innings of work. =MLB Draft= Originally, he was drafted in the 12th round of the 1982 amateur draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Choosing not to sign that time, he was drafted 10th overall in the 1983 amateur draft by the Padres, at which time he did choose to sign. =Professional baseball= 1983 Hayward began his professional career with the Beaumont Golden Gators, going 5–1 with a 1.76 ERA and 71 strikeouts in 66 innings of work. He completed five and shutout two of the 10 games he started. 1984 In 1984, Hayward pitched for the Las Vegas Stars, going 9–6 with a 4.87 ERA.

He'd start in two more games that year, going 0-2 with a 9.00 ERA overall. 1987 1987 was Hayward's best minor league season since his professional rookie year. In 23 games (22 starts), he went 8–5 with a 3.10 ERA. In 142 innings, he struck out 115 batters. So impressive it was in fact that the Padres recalled him, and on June 10 he made his first big league appearance of the 1987 season.

In 78 innings of work, he allowed 10 home runs and 42 walks, and he struck out 45 batters. =Non-playing career= Following the conclusion of his playing career, Hayward would serve as an area scout for the Detroit Tigers from 1994–99. In 2000, Hayward received his first coaching job with his alma mater, the Oklahoma Sooners. Hayward held the pitching coach and recruiting coordinator positions at OU until 2004, when he accepted the position as the Midwest scouting supervisor for the Miami Marlins. Hayward would serve as the scouting supervisor for the Marlins from 2005–12 before accepting the pitching coach position at Texas Tech under coach Tim Tadlock.

Incumbent Republican United States Senator J. Caleb Boggs ran for a third term in the United States Senate. Boggs faced off against Joe Biden, a New Castle County Councilman. Though Senator Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms. General election campaign Longtime Delaware political figure and incumbent Republican Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. President Richard Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support. No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs besides Biden, a New Castle County Councilman., p. 43. Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers. Biden did receive some assistance from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell. Biden's campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and \\"change\\". During the summer Biden trailed by almost 30 percentage points, but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs., p. 364. Biden won the November 7, 1972 election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes. In 2004, admitted mafia hitman and former Teamsters Local 326 President Frank Sheeran alleged in his memoir that in the week prior to Election Day an unidentified representative of the Biden campaign (described as the campaign's legal counsel) approached him about preventing the distribution of the Wilmington News Journal because Sen. Boggs was running an advertisement unflattering to Biden. In exchange for undisclosed considerations and because Sheeran felt \\"Biden was better for labor anyway,\\" the Teamsters Union allegedly organized a strike preventing the newspapers from being delivered and sabotaged a shipment of newspaper printing materials and preventing the Wilmington News Journal from being distributed in the week prior to Election day. Sheeran's accusation is unclear as to whether Biden himself was aware of the plot, but after the election Sheeran said he \\"could always reach out to [Biden] and he would listen.\\"https://www.amazon.com/Heard-You-Paint-Houses- Irishman/dp/1586422383 Whether Sheeran's account can be deemed credible has been called into serious question. It conflicts directly with articles in the Wilmington News-Journal on the strike, published on November 6 and November 22, 1972. While there was a newspaper strike in Wilmington in November 1972, it was not a Teamster strike. It was an American Newspaper Guild Local #10 strike. The paper was not printed on the days in question because the Printers Union briefly joined the strike, not because of a picket line \\"no one would mess with.\\" The paper's deliveries were not shut down for a week, but for only two days. The picket line did not come down on the day after the election, but the Guild remained on strike until Nov. 22, The picket line denoted an economic strike at a primary employer, and would not have been an \\"informational picket line.\\" At the time of the election Biden was a little less than 30 years old; age 30 is a constitutional requirement for the U.S. Senate, and he reached that on November 20, in time for the Senate term beginning January 3. After his election he became the sixth-youngest Senator in history.

It was originally published by Schaper Toys in 1960 and was recently re-released with slightly different rules by Winning Moves Games USA in 2006. The game is no longer in production. Gameplay (1960) In the original Schaper game, players took turns moving marbles up a 3-D Mountain shaped board. Each turn, a player would use an hourglass-shaped teeter-totter device to determine the amount of spaces they could move that turn. They would then pick one of their marbles and move it along the board's path that number of spaces. If the marble ends its move on a space where another marble is, it continues along to the next open space. If the marble lands on a hole space, they drop their marble into the hole, where it comes out lower on the board. If they managed to get their marble to the top of the mountain, they would drop it into a hole in the middle. This could trigger a crown to pop up and the player would win. If not, the player would start their marble back on the track. Gameplay (2006) The newer version has slightly different rules and a much different look. The board now features a large crater in the center instead of a mountain and the board track winds around the crater, running along aside the crater at roughly the halfway point and end of the track. Also gone are the holes in the track. Instead, players with a marble on the track next to the crater are dropped into the crater of another player ends their turn on them. A marble dropped into the crater this way comes out of one of three \\"caves\\" on corners of the board and is then placed back on the track on one of the spaces next to the \\"cave.\\" Additionally, the end game is totally different. Instead of the mechanized crown, players instead try to be the first to get both their marbles into the \\"Finish Zone.\\" References Board games introduced in 1960 ","title":"King of the Hill (board game)"},{"id":"19673329","text":"County Court bailiffs are employees of Her Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service and are responsible for enforcing orders of the County Court by recovering money owed under County Court judgments. They can seize and sell goods to recover the amount of the debt. They can also serve court documents and effect and supervise the possession of property and the return of goods under hire purchase agreements. Entry A County Court bailiff can enter a premises to seize goods and sell these at public auction, they can enter a property through an unlocked door (front and back). If the bailiff has entry previously (made a levy) or has been forcefully removed they can then use reasonable force to gain re-entry to inspect the goods or remove them. When determining the value of goods to be seized, it is the likely price that the goods will reach at auction that is pertinent, not what was paid for them. Police assistance Section 85(4) of the County Courts Act 1984 states: It shall be the duty of every constable within his jurisdiction to assist in the execution of every such warrant. This is rarely used and if the police are called they will generally be there to prevent a breach of the peace. There has been debate about the lack of training that police are given with respect to the powers of bailiffs whilst executing a warrant. Penalty for assaulting County Court bailiffs Section 14 of the County Court Act 1984 gives the following penalty: If any person assaults an officer of a court while in the execution of his duty, he shall be liable— :(a) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to a fine of an amount not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both; or :(b) on an order made by the judge in that behalf, to be committed for a specified period not exceeding 3 months to prison or to such a fine as aforesaid, or to be so committed and to such a fine, and a Bailiff of the court may take the offender into custody, with or without warrant, and bring him before the judge. Debtor's vehicle A debtor's vehicle can be immobilised or removed and goods can be taken up to the value of outstanding judgment plus additional bailiff/removal/auction house fees. Vehicles may be immobilised/removed on both private or public land but if on private land the bailiff has to have the land owners permission to enter if the land doesn't belong to the person named on the warrant.

He was promoted to high rank while relatively young as a result of his gallantry and unswerving dedication to his country. Early life Charles Dawson Booker was born to Joseph Dawson and Rachel C. Booker at Burnt House Cottage, Speldhurst, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. He spent part of his youth in Australia, attending the Grammar School in Melbourne from February 1908 through December 1911. He then returned to England and attended Bedford School until May 1915. On 8 September 1915, he was accepted into the Royal Naval Air Service as a Flight Sub-Lieutenant. First tour of service He served on the Belgian Coast, first with 5 Naval Wing, then with 8 Naval Squadron from May through October 1916, and further inland for another year, through November 1917. He did not open his victory roll until 23 January 1917, after his transfer to 8 Naval, when he drove an Albatros D.III down out of control while piloting a Sopwith Pup. After a lapse of some months, he used a Sopwith Triplane to score four times in April, becoming an ace on the 30th. Even at this early stage, he was flight commander of C Flight despite his youth. He was described by one of his wingmen as \\"...a little fellow, usually very silent, who fears nothing, but he would run a mile from any girl....he hopes the war will go on forever because he loves air fighting, and if the war were to end he is afraid he might not be able to find a suitable job.\\"Franks May was an especially notable month for Booker, with nine victories, including a triple on the 24th. On 22 June, after his 17th win, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross; the citation noted his three wins tallied on 24 May. After three victories in July, he shot down and badly wounded German ace Hauptmann Adolf Ritter von Tutschek, commander of Jasta 12, on 11 August 1917; Tutschek would take half a year to recover. In this same fight, Booker was so badly shot about that German ace Viktor Schobinger claimed Booker as a victory. Booker actually managed to coax his destroyed 'Tripehound' to a forced landing in friendly territory. He had used Sopwith Triplanes (his usual aircraft being serial number N5482, which he whimsically dubbed 'Maude') to run his string of triumphs to 23 by this time. The crash landing on the 11th was the end of 'Maude'. It had been his mount for at least 14 triumphs. On 27 September, he scored his first victory while flying a Sopwith Camel; he shot down German ace Oberleutnant Hans Waldhausen of Jasta 37, who became a prisoner. However, Naval 8, and Booker, were withdrawn from action in November and returned to England. Booker was the fourth ranked of the 25 aces in this prestigious squadron. Second tour of service After some months back in England, he returned to France as a Major commanding 201 Squadron of the newly formed Royal Air Force. He had been given the command in March, just shy of his 21st birthday. Once again, he would be flying a Camel. He led 201 by example, scoring two May victories and one in July. In May, on the 27th, he identified the body of his friend, Australian ace Robert Little, who had been shot down nearby.Shores, p. 81 On 13 August 1918, he was leading a rookie pilot on an orientation tour of their aerial battlefield. The two Camel pilots ran into a formation of at least six expert pilots from Jagdgeschwader 2. Booker tackled them single-handedly to cover the green pilot's retreat. It was the greenhorn who verified Booker's final three wins. However, Jasta 12's ace Leutnant Ulrich Neckel finally shot Booker down.Franks, p. 15 Booker was buried in Vignacourt British Cemetery, Somme, France. He had claimed 29 victories; he shared in the capture of two enemy airplanes; destroyed ten, including six victories shared with other pilots; and drove down 17 'out of control', including five shared wins.

History In the mid-1950s, the Lee Ackerman Investment Company of Phoenix promoted this area which was then without water, electricity or any human habitation. They surveyed the land, marked off five or ten-acre parcels and bladed primitive roads through the desert. They marketed the parcels with heavy advertising (e.g. full page ads in the Arizona Republic) and high-pressure sales practices. Parcels were sold for ten percent down with a ten-year contract.

Early career Hambro earned a law degree (cand.jur.) from the University of Oslo in 1991. She joined the Ministry of the Environment the same year and in 1997 became head of her department, where she worked on waste management issues. Norway's industrial employers credited her with raising the percentage of waste recycled from almost nothing to about 70%.

Directorship Since 1 January 2007 she has directed Norway's Climate and Pollution Agency (before 2010, called the Pollution Control Authority). She is the first woman to hold the post. Green Warriors of Norway expressed approval of her appointment. During Hambro's directorship, SFT imposed a fine of on Autoretur, which was in charge of handling car wrecks. Hambro cited the company's inadequate return system, and warned of another fine if this was not remedied. In an interview with Teknisk Ukeblad, Hambro admitted mistakes by the Pollution Authority before and after the Vest Tank explosion in Gulen, May 24, 2007. She said that the pollution authority ought to be better at investigating possible breaches of safety regulations, and that they could have offered better information to the Gulen community. She was also highly critical of the Vest Tank company, accusing them of lying and illegal waste management. Vest Tank responded by suing her for defamation. Hambro was sceptical of the merger between Statoil and the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro, stating that the companies would no longer need to compete on being environmentally friendly. She was also critical of StatoilHydro's application to increase emissions at their LNG plant at Meløya in Hammerfest. In 2013 her agency was merged to form the Norwegian Environment Agency.

It was used primarily for late-model automobile racing. History The original one-mile dirt oval was built as a horse track. On October 7, 1906, the track hosted its first motorcycle race, followed by an automobile race three days later. These events continued regularly through 1917. A 10,000-seat grandstand was built in 1925. In 1932 the oval was reduced to a half-mile circuit. The smaller configuration was used until July 4, 1942, when it closed for World War II. It was reopened on October 1, 1946, and began hosting weekly auto-racing events organized by promoter J. P. Rotton. A quarter-mile dirt oval was added in 1958 and was the first track to be paved, with the first events held on the new surface on July 15, 1960. After one season of racing on the quarter-mile track the present five-eighths-mile course was constructed with its first race held on June 28, 1962. With new lighting the Sunday afternoon races were moved to Friday nights. Between 1958 and 1968 a total of eight NASCAR Cup Series races were run at the Fairgrounds Raceway. During the same period Bobby Allison had moved to Hueytown from Miami, Florida, and convinced his brother Donnie and fellow racer Red Farmer to join him in founding a new race shop. The so-called \\"Alabama Gang\\" dominated the races at the Fairgrounds track, but other legends of the sport also recorded wins, including \\"Fireball\\" Roberts, Richard Petty, and Ned Jarrett. In 1969, the sanctioning body moved the date from Birmingham to a new fast 2.66 mile track, the Alabama International Motor Speedway. The track also hosted one NASCAR Convertible Series event in 1959 and 4 NASCAR Southeast Series races between 1991 and 2002. The facility hosted one CARS Hooters Pro Cup Series event in 1997. Her final day of racing glory was October 26, 2008. On the final day, there were two divisions that raced, Modified's and Late Model. Dustin Knowles started from the pole, led every lap, and won the modified race. Justin South won the late model race in a photo finish. http://blog.al.com/blogoftomorrow/2008/10/world_classic_results_from_bir.html Proposed move On June 19, 2008, Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford proposed a plan to move BIR from the Fairgrounds to city-owned property in northwest Birmingham. Langford said the track, which has been in continuous operation for over 80 years in Five Points West, needs to be upgraded, and does not fit into current plans for the renovation of Fair Park. Langford committed $1 million to the project, but stated that track officials would have to come up with the majority of the funds needed for the project. After the 2008 race season, the track was shut down. On January 30, 2009, demolition of the grandstand began, and was completed two months later.

The chapel, dedicated to Saint Vladimir, was built by Russian prisoners of war engaged in forced labor in the area during World War I. It serves as both a war memorial and a symbolic link between Slovenia and Russia. History Russian Road to the Vršič Pass In early 1915, the small town of Kranjska Gora suddenly became strategically important due to its proximity to the Isonzo Front. To facilitate access from the town to the front, the Austro-Hungarian authorities ordered the construction of a military road across the Vršič Pass, a 1,611 m pass between the Sava and Soča Valleys, to be built by Russian prisoners of war (POWs).Tourist Destinations in Kranjska Gora The road was begun in May 1915, and was completed by the end of the year. To ensure an uninterrupted supply of materiel to the front lines, the pass was to be kept traversable year-round, and the POWs were forced to clear the road of heavy snowfall. On 8 or 12 March 1916 (sources vary), an avalanche buried a POW work camp, killing approximately 110 prisoners and about 7 guards. During the time of the construction there were more than 380 casualties in total. Exact casualty figures were never determined, either for the victims of the avalanche of for those of the brutal overwork and appalling conditions. The Russian camp was located roughly halfway up the slope of Vršic. Until November 1916, the remaining prisoners built a small wooden memorial chapel. The building is of typical Russian design, with two small towers on either side of the nave, and is surrounded by prisoners' graves and a pyramid-shaped memorial marker to the immediate right of the chapel, with the Cyrillic inscription reading \\"To the sons of Russia\\". The site was renovated in 2005, at a cost of €90,000, and again in 2010 after a theft of the copper roof plates. The pass road on the Kranjska Gora side from the Erika Hotel to the top was renamed \\"Russian Road\\" () in June 2006.

Originally from a Britany family settled in Ile Bourbon, Jean-Marie Dayot was born in Port Louis, Ile Maurice. He became a Lieutenant de vaisseau auxiliaire in the French Royal Navy.Mantienne, p.154 He met with Pigneau de Béhaine either in the Île Bourbon or Pondicherry, and is thought to have commanded one of the two commercial ships which accompanied the warship Méduse with Pigneau de Behaine to Vietnam. Entering the service of Nguyễn Ánh, by 1790 he was in command of a naval division composed of two European warships belonging to Nguyễn Ánh. In 1792, he fought in the naval battle against the Tây Sơn in front of Qui Nhơn, sinking 5 warships, 90 galleys and about 100 smaller boats. In 1793, against at Qui Nhơn, he captured 60 Tây Sơn galleys.Mantienne, p.154 Jean-Marie Dayot also did considerable hydrographic work, making numerous maps of the Vietnamese coast, which were drawn by his talented brother.Mantienne, p.156 In 1795, Jean-Marie Dayot stranded his ship, was condemned for negligence and put to the cangue. Disgusted, he left Cochinchina.Contradictory with the version of Georges Taboulet in La geste française en Indochine : 1615-1857 according to which Dayot left Cochinchina because some mandarins had been executed by Gia Long. Jean-Marie Dayot then settled in Manila, from where he traded with Mexico. He died in 1809 when his ship sank in the Gulf of Tonkin. His brother would die in Macao in 1821.

The word cimarrón in Latin America is used to mean feral, referring to the breed's history. Other names by which it is known in English are Cimarrón, Cimarrón Creole, Cimarrón Dog, Maroon Dog, Cerro Largo Dog, Uruguayan Gaucho Dog, Perro Cimarrón, possibly others. The breed is officially recognised in Uruguay and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale with the name Cimarrón Uruguayo. Appearance The Cimarrón Uruguayo is large in size, compact and muscular. The coat is short and usually brindle but may be a pale yellow (\\"bayo\\"), with a black face. Height of males at the withers is from 58 to 61 cm (23 to 24 in) and weight is from 38 to 45 kg (84 to 99 lb). Adult females are slightly smaller. Temperament The breed standard states that the dog should have great courage. As with all large dogs, the Cimarrón Uruguayo must be well socialized when very young if it is to be safely kept as a companion. It is a very friendly dog with children and other animals. The Cimarrón Uruguayo is sometimes used for guarding, hunting, and all dog sports in its native Uruguay. Being a very smart dog it has been used for all kinds of jobs, such as rescue or herding. It is a rather calm and stable dog and doesn't usually bark unless a threat is real. History The Cimarrón Uruguayo mainly descends from the Alano Español and other European dogs brought by early colonizers and released or abandoned. The dogs adapted to living in the wild in Uruguay and in time became numerous. In the eighteenth century, attacks on livestock and even humans resulted in the dogs being hunted, with bounties paid by the government for each dog killed. However, many remained, especially in the highlands of Cerro Largo. Ranchers in the area would capture and tame the dogs, using them as guard dogs. The Cimarrón's survival story and fierceness has made it something of a national symbol in Uruguay and the breed is the mascot of the National Army of Uruguay.Perros Cimarrones, with photos of the dog in military parade (in Spanish) The Kennel Club Uruguayo (Uruguayan national kennel club) recognised the Cimarrón Uruguayo after some twenty years of work by fanciers and breeders in documenting the breed.Government site, \\"The dog of Cerro Largo\\" (in Spanish) showing photograph of President Tabaré Vázquez holding his Cimarrón puppy In addition, genetic studies are being done on the breed by the Universidad de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay college of Veterinary Medicine. The Cimarrón Uruguayo was provisionally recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale on February 21, 2006, and definitively on November 7, 2017 in Group 2, Section 2 Molossoid breeds-Mastiff type. The breed has been exported to the United States, and is recognised there by the United Kennel Club in the Guardian Dog Group. Health The Cimarrón Uruguayo should be tested for hip and elbow dysplasia before breeding.Sociedad de Criadores de Cimarrón Uruguayo, Uruguayan breed club website Often the ears are cropped short when the dogs are very young. This is alleged to be in homage to the days when they were hunted (the ears were presented for the bounty).

He designed parks and other public works, subdivisions and private estates, primarily in Ohio. Taylor was born in Carlisle, Massachusetts to Nathaniel A. and Ellen F. (Davis) Taylor. He received an A.B. from Boston College in 1905 and an M.L.A. from the College of Agriculture at Cornell University in 1906, where he taught until 1908. He then joined the office of Warren H. Manning, where he was influenced by Manning’s informal and naturalistic approach to landscape design as he worked on such projects as Stan Hywet Hall in Akron. In 1914 Taylor established his own practice in Cleveland, eventually opening a second office in Florida. His firm provided landscape design for the Van Sweringens’ Daisy Hill Estate in Cleveland, J.J. Emery’s Peterloon Estate in Cincinnati, the H.H. Timken Estate in Canton, and Julius Fleischmann’s Winding Creek Farm. The office also designed the Avondale subdivision in Akron and the Rookwood subdivision in Cincinnati. During the Depression, Taylor participated in a number of CWA projects. The following is a partial list of public works on which his firm worked: * Alms Park, Cincinnati, Ohio * Ault Park, Cincinnati, Ohio * Baldwin Filtration Plant Reservoir, Cleveland, Ohio * Boys Town, Nebraska * Cumberland Park, Cleveland Heights, Ohio * Mt.

E. M. Skues published in London in 1910. Minor Tactics was Skues's first book and set the stage for his ascendancy as the inventor of nymph fishing for trout. Synopsis Frontispiece from Minor Tactics depicting 13 of Skues's favorite flies Although Minor Tactics begins in the foreword with thanks and appreciation to F. M. Halford for his Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice published in 1889 as the last word on chalk stream fishing for trout, the book marks Skues's long campaign to restore the wet fly to its rightful place on the chalk streams of England from which the wet fly had been banished during the dogmatic dry fly period of the last 19th century. From the Foreword: > Rising from the perusal of \\"Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice\\" on its > publication by F. M. Halford in 1889, I think I was at one with most anglers > of the day in feeling that the last word had been written on the art of > chalk-stream fishing—so sane, so clear, so comprehensive, is it ; so just > and so in accord with one's own experience. Twenty years have gone by since > then without my having had either occasion or inclination to go back at all > upon this view of that, the greatest work, in my opinion, which has ever > seen the light on the subject of angling for trout and grayling; and it is > still, as regards that side of the subject with which it deals, all that I > then believed it. But one result of the triumph of the dry fly, of which > that work was the crown and consummation, was the obliteration from the > minds of men, in much less than a generation, of all the wet-fly lore which > had served many generations of chalk stream anglers well. The effect was > stunning, hypnotic, submerging; and in these days, if one excepts a few > eccentrics who have been nurtured on the wet fly on other waters, and have > little experience of chalk streams, one would find few with any notion that > anything but the dry fly could be effectively used upon Hampshire rivers, or > that the wet fly was ever used there. I was for years myself under the > spell, and it is the purpose of the ensuing pages to tell, for the benefit > of the angling community, by what processes, by what stages, I have been led > into a sustained effort to recover for this generation, and to transmute > into forms suited to the modern conditions of sport on the chalk stream, the > old wet-fly art, to be used as a supplement to, and in no sense to supplant > or rival, the beautiful art of which Mr. F. M. Halford is the prophet. How > far my effort has been successful I must leave my readers to judge. I myself > feel that in making it I have widened my angling horizon, and that I have > added enormously to the interest and charm of my angling days as well as to > my chances of success, and that, too, by the use of no methods which the > most rigid purist could rightly condemn, but by a difficult, delicate, > fascinating, and entirely legitimate form of the art, well worthy of the > naturalist sportsman. In the course of my too rare excursions to the river- > side, I have elaborated some devices, methods of attack and handling, which > I have found of service, some applicable to wet-fly, some to dry-fly > fishing, or to both. In the hope that these may be of interest or service, I > have included papers upon them. Reviews In A History of Fly Fishing for Trout (1921), John Waller Hills wrote: > But there is another [tendency], and that is the revival of the sunk fly, > even on ground from which it was believed to have been banished for ever. > This revival is due largely to the writings of Mr. G. E. M. Skues, whose > Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream was published in 1910. In this book he > proves conclusively that the sunk fly has its use on the shyest chalk > stream, that it will kill when the dry fly will not, and that it is a form > of fishing as difficult and as entrancing as the other. It is an original > book, and it is no disparagement to its originality to say that it is > founded on the wisdom of our ancestors. Mr. Skues is indebted to Stewart > both for his method of fishing and of tying flies, a debt which he amply > acknowledges. His great merit is that he has revived and brought up to date > for use on chalk streams what was a lost art. He has rediscovered and > restated it in terms suited to to-day. His book gives fishing a new starting > point, and opens a new chapter in its history. In Notable Angling Literature (1945) James Robb said of Skues and Minor Tactics > One of the subtlest writers on fishing with fly in any form is G.E.M. Skues, > the author of Nymph Fishing. His book Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream, put > and end to the dry-fly purist and brought the angling world back to sanity In A Summer on the Test (1930) by John Waller Hill as quoted by Arnold Gingrich in The Fishing in Print (1974) Hills wrote: > When, exactly twenty years ago, Mr. Skues wrote Minor Tactics of the Chalk > Stream, he effected a revolution. The dry fly was a height of its intolerant > dictatorship, and the other method was discarded and ridiculed to such an > extent that enthusiasts of the school of Halford regarded Mr. Skues as a > dangerous heresiarch...

The series was originally hosted by literary critic John Mason Brown and produced by Martin Stone Productions with NBC Television. Each week's show was sponsored by Encyclopedia Americana. The 30-minute show aired Mondays at 8:10pm ET in the 1947-48 television season, and Mondays at 8:30pm ET in the 1948–49 season. Format The quiz, whose slogan was \\"Your program about your country\\", involved five contestants (originally adults, changed to high school students by March 1949) answering viewer-submitted questions about American history. A panel of three actors would perform short skits (with either one actor or more in each), after which the contestants would try to answer the questions. Hosts On January 21, 1948, Brown was replaced by composer and musical critic Deems Taylor, who only hosted that show and the January 28 episode. On February 4 he was replaced by Ben Grauer, who was at the time recognized for hosting Information Please on NBC Radio since 1938. In 1949, Vivian Ferrer joined Grauer as co-host, likely remaining with the series through its end.

A compilation of current biographical information of general interest. Volume 30, Numbers 1-12. Ann Arbor, MI: Bell & Howell Information & Learning Co., 1999. His and Evarts Ambrose Graham's joint publication of \\"Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of 684 Proved Cases\\" appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was one of the first major scientific publications identifying smoking as a contributory cause of lung cancer.  Biography  Wynder was born in Herford, Westphalia in 1922 to Jewish parents (a cousin of Robert Weinberg).Angier, N. 1988. Natural obsessions: striving to unlock the deepest secrets of the cancer cell. Houghton Mifflin, page 46. In 1938 his family escaped Nazi rule and fled to the United States, where Wynder enrolled at New York University. During World War II, he attained citizenship and joined the U.S. Army, where, as a German- speaker, he was assigned to a psychological warfare unit to monitor German newscasts. After the war, he attended medical school at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1950, he received both a Bachelor of Science and a medical degree. Aside from his credentials as a physician, Wynder was a researcher, educator, and activist. He devoted his career to the study and prevention of cancer and chronic disease, publishing hundreds of scientific papers. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he worked at Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. In 1969, he founded the American Health Foundation. In 1972, he founded the academic journal Preventive Medicine and served as the founding editor. Wynder died from thyroid cancer on July 14, 1999.Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pages 133-134. Also see  Scholarship  = Smoking and Lung Cancer Studies = Wynder began collaborating with his coauthor on the article, Evarts Ambrose Graham, as a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis in 1947. The previous summer he had conducted epidemiological studies of smoking behavior among 146 lung cancer patients in New York City. The project was funded by the American Cancer Society. Now, with Graham, Wynder collected extensive data on 604 patients with lung cancer at hospitals across the United States. Departing from a tradition of using anecdotal evidence (e.g., clinical interviews) to develop explanations of disease causation, Wynder and Graham applied rudimentary statistical methods to their study. They divided patients into crude categories of \\"moderate\\" or \\"heavy\\" smokers, based on retrospective interviews of each patient's smoking behavior over a twenty-year period. They also measured and controlled for important confounding factors (e.g., age, types of tobacco use, inhalation level). Most importantly, with regard to an ability to demonstrate causation, Wynder and Graham also studied a control group of cancer-free individuals in hospitals. They systematically compared the lung cancer patients to the control group.Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pages 131-132. On May 27, 1950 the Journal of the American Medical Association published the resulting scientific report. Incidence among men and women matched patterns of smoking behavior in men and women: \\"the enormous increase in the sale of cigarettes in this country approximately parallels the increase in [lung cancer].\\" Also see Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pages 132-133. As further scientific evidence of smoking's role in causing lung cancer began to accumulate in the United States and Great Britain, Wynder and Graham investigated the biological plausibility of the association between smoking and lung disease. In 1950, they initiated a study of the impact of cigarette tar condensate from tobacco smoke on the skin of mice. After a year of exposure to tar, 44 percent of the mice developed cancers. Wynder also discovered specific carcinogens in tar (e.g., benzopyrenes, arsenic), but was unable to identify the contributions of these chemicals to cancer. Wynder's studies of tobacco smoke were timely and important. Whereas laboratory studies of tobacco tar had been conducted elsewhere, Wynder's findings supported the growing epidemiological data. \\"The production of tumors in lab animals offered a powerful indicator that something in cigarette smoke could account for the epidemiological findings,\\" writes Allan M. Brandt, a historian of medicine.Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, page 147. = Other Research = Wynder published nearly 800 papers during his lifetime. Wynder's work appeared in 139 periodicals and one book. More than half of his articles were published in ten prestigious mainline journals, such as Cancer, the flagship journal of the American Cancer Society. The dominant themes were lung and breast cancer, but there were also in-depth studies of the epidemiology of cancer of the bladder, larynx, colon and rectum, stomach, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and kidney, as well as numerous experimental studies. Many of these papers were the first or most comprehensive studies ever published, especially the massive 1960 coauthored study of the epidemiology of breast cancer.

Revised edition, Springfield 1920, p. 120. The sestain is probably next in popularity to the quatrain in European literature. Usually there are three rhymes in the six-line strophe, but sometimes there are only two. * Rhyme-scheme AABBCC: : I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he; : I gallop’d, Dirck gallop’d, we gallop’d all three; : “Good speed !” cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew; : “Speed!” echoed the wall to us galloping through; : Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, : And into the midnight we gallop’d abreast. : (Robert Browning, How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix, 1-6) : The AABBCC is the simplest rhyme-scheme of the sestain. It was very popular in Old Polish poetry. * Rhyme-scheme ABABCC: : Even as the sun with purple- colour'd face : Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn, : Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase; : Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn; : Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him, : And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him. : (William Shakespeare, Venus and Adonis, 1-6) : The ABABCC rhyme-scheme is one of the most important forms in European poetry.

The concept was originally defined by Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin in 1986 and is a version of continuity that finds application in the study of continuous games. Notation and preliminaries Consider a game with N agents with agent i having strategy A_i\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}; write \\\\mathbf{a} for an N-tuple of actions (i.e. \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\in\\\\prod_{j=1}^NA_j) and \\\\mathbf{a}_{-i}=(a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\\\ldots,a_N) as the vector of all agents' actions apart from agent i. Let U_i:A_i\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} be the payoff function for agent i. A game is defined as [(A_i,U_i); i=1,\\\\ldots,N]. Definition Function U_i:A\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} is graph continuous if for all \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\in A there exists a function F_i:A_{-i}\\\\longrightarrow A_i such that U_i(F_i(\\\\mathbf{a}_{-i}),\\\\mathbf{a}_{-i}) is continuous at \\\\mathbf{a}_{-i}. Dasgupta and Maskin named this property \\"graph continuity\\" because, if one plots a graph of a player's payoff as a function of his own strategy (keeping the other players' strategies fixed), then a graph-continuous payoff function will result in this graph changing continuously as one varies the strategies of the other players. The property is interesting in view of the following theorem. If, for 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq N, A_i\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^m is non-empty, convex, and compact; and if U_i:A\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} is quasi-concave in a_i, upper semi-continuous in \\\\mathbf{a}, and graph continuous, then the game [(A_i,U_i); i=1,\\\\ldots,N] possesses a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

The office of TeachingBooks.net is located in Madison, Wisconsin. The company and database were founded by Nick Glass.  History  The database was founded upon the premise that educators find enjoyment and professional value in seeing and hearing authors talk about their work. Nick Glass, the founder, had hosted many author presentations in his previous work — bringing authors to bookstores, schools, libraries, and conferences — and had arranged live author programs for educators over a distance-learning video network. Each author interaction with educators inspired new insights for teaching and sharing books with children. In April 2000, the genesis for the database took form. It debuted at the American Library Association convention in San Francisco in June 2001 and was launched on the Internet September 1, 2001. It began selling licenses in November 2003.  Uses  The TeachingBooks.net database is used in educational and home settings. Educators can use the site to host virtual author visits so students can learn from professional writers via the audio and video resources on the site. Movies of Caldecott-winning illustrators demonstrate art processes. Audio excerpts are used by students, including English language learners, to independently learn the rhythm, pace, and sound of the books they are reading. Users can also listen to poets read their work, get information for author/illustrator studies, and to find book guides for fiction and non-fiction titles.  Content  TeachingBooks.net specializes in creating original content with authors and illustrators. Staff from the database interview children's and young adult authors in their homes to create brief Author Program videos. In the Original Author Program videos, authors discuss journaling, doing research, storytelling, reader's theatre, bringing history to life, and working with inspiring ideas.

Woodhead was primarily a left Winger who also played as a stand in centre forward when needed. Throughout his career he made 343 appearances including FA Cup matches and scored 108 goals.Since 1888. Gives career statistics. Early life Woodhead, a grandson of former Wednesday player Billy Betts, was born on 12 June 1925 in the Hillsborough area of Sheffield. As a schoolboy he represented Sheffield Boys at both football and cricket. Upon leaving school he played football for his works team Edgar Allen's for whom he worked as a fitter. At the same time he also played for Hillsborough Boys Club, a nursery side for Sheffield Wednesday. In 1941 the 16-year-old Woodhead was invited to train with Sheffield Wednesday, however his initial connection with the club was brief, playing just one wartime match, before joining the RAF as a bomber flight engineer. Woodhead completed 31 bombing missions during World War II and was finally de-mobbed from the RAF in early 1947. Professional career =Sheffield Wednesday= Woodhead had signed full professional terms with Sheffield Wednesday in April 1945 whilst still on active war service and he made his debut for the club on 24 May 1947 shortly after leaving the RAF. He played the last three games of that 1946–47 season as Wednesday managed to avoid relegation from Division Two. The following two seasons saw Woodhead miss only eight league matches as he made the left wing position his own. However, on the first day of the 1949–50 season (20 August) he broke his right leg in a 3–1 victory over Leicester City and did not return to the first team until the Christmas Eve home match against Bradford City where he scored a late equaliser. The fine form of Walter Rickett kept Woodhead out of the side for much of the remainder of the season although he did return for the vital last few matches of the campaign as Wednesday gained promotion to the First Division.Dennis Woodhead at Sheffield Wednesday Legends.

Woodhead returned as a regular to the team in the following season in Division One, scoring 14 goals and ending as joint top scorer with Hugh McJarrow and Redfern Froggatt. Woodhead played the last nine games of the campaign as a stand in Centre Forward, scoring nine goals as Wednesday struggled in attack and were eventually relegated. The start of following season saw Woodhead again playing at centre forward, scoring seven goals in the opening nine games before picking up a bad injury. This allowed Derek Dooley to force his way into the side, scoring an amazing 46 goals in 30 appearances as Wednesday lifted the Second Division championship.\\"Wednesday!\\", Keith Farnsworth, Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. Woodhead remained first choice left winger for the following two seasons in Division One, doing especially well in 1953-54 when he top scored with 21 goals including three in the FA Cup as Wednesday reached the semi-final where they lost to Preston North End at Maine Road. The 1954-55 campaign saw Woodhead lose his regular spot in the team as Wednesday had a disastrous season, being relegated by nine points. He was in and out of the team as Alan Finney and Jackie Marriott played in the wing positions and limited Woodhead to just ten appearances in his final season at Hillsborough. Following relegation Wednesday manager Eric Taylor decided to rebuild the team and brought in 20-year-old Albert Broadbent from Notts County as a replacement for the 30-year-old Woodhead.\\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\\", Tony Matthews, Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career and biographical information. =Latter career= Woodhead was signed by Chesterfield manager Teddy Davison for a fee of £2,000 on 9 September 1955 and made a thrilling debut scoring three goals in a 7–2 home win over Rochdale. He was selected to play for the Third Division North team against the South in 1955/56. However his stay at Saltergate lasted only four months, making 16 appearances in total before joining Derby County in January 1956 for a fee of £1,500. Woodhead had three good seasons with Derby, helping them to promotion from Division Three North in 1956-57 when he scored 14 goals. In February 1959 he was sold to Southport for £750 but the move only lasted four games after it was found that Woodhead had an ongoing knee injury and he was instructed to return to Derby by The Football League after a month.

Its circulations generally do not extend below in altitude, as it is an example of a cold-core low. A weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found beneath it, and it may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of circulation at ground level. In rare cases, a warm-core cyclone can develop in its associated convective activity, resulting in a tropical cyclone and a weakening and southwest movement of the nearby upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex. Symbiotic relationships can exist between tropical cyclones and the upper level lows in their wake, with the two systems occasionally leading to their mutual strengthening. When they move over land during the warm season, an increase in monsoon rains occurs. History of research Using charts of mean 200-hectopascal circulation for July through August (located above sea level) to locate the circumpolar troughs and ridges, trough lines extend over the eastern and central North Pacific and over the North Atlantic. Case studies of upper tropospheric cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific have been performed by using airplane reports (winds, temperatures and heights), radiosonde data, geostationary satellite cloud imagery, and cloud-tracked winds throughout the troposphere. It was determined they were the origin of an upper tropospheric cold-core lows, or cut-off lows. Characteristics The tropical upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, meaning it is stronger aloft than at the Earth's surface, or stronger in areas of the troposphere with lower pressures. This is explained by the thermal wind relationship. It also means that a pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. If both an upper tropospheric cold-core low and lower tropospheric easterly wave trough are in-phase, with the easterly wave near or to the east of the upper level cyclone, thunderstorm development (also known as moist convection) is enhanced. If they are out-of-phase, with the tropical wave west of the upper level circulation, convection is suppressed due to convergence aloft leading to downward motion over the tropical wave or surface trough in the easterlies. Upper level cyclones also interact with troughs in the subtropical westerlies, such as cold fronts and stationary fronts. When the subtropical disturbances in the Northern Hemisphere actively move southward, or dig, the area between the upper tropospheric anticyclone to its west and cold-core low to its east generally have strong northeasterly winds in addition to a rapid development of active thunderstorm activity. Cloud bands associated with upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices are aligned with the vertical wind shear. Animated satellite cloud imagery is a better tool for their early detection and tracking. The low-level convergence caused by the cut-off low can trigger squall lines and rough seas, and the low-level spiral cloud bands caused by the upper level circulation are parallel to the low- level wind direction. This has also been witnessed with upper level lows which occur at higher latitudes. For example, in areas where small-scale snow bands develop within the cold sector of extratropical cyclones. Climatology In the Northern Hemisphere, the tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) normally occurs between May and November, with peak activity between July and September. James Sadler suggested a revised model for the TUTT during the early part of the typhoon season in the western Pacific. Both Sadler and Lance Bosart have shown that the tropical upper tropospheric trough cyclonic cells are caused by the mid-latitude disturbance riding around the western side of the tropical upper tropospheric trough when the subtropical ridge to its south is quite weak. In the north Atlantic, the TUTT is characterized by the semi- permanent circulation pattern that forms in the North Atlantic between August and November. Toby Carlson evaluated data over the eastern Caribbean sea for October 1965 and pinpointed the presence of an upper tropospheric cold-core cyclone. These cold-core cyclones generally form close to the Azores and move south and westward towards a latitude of 20°N. These circulations extend over an area of about 20° of latitude (or ) and 40° of longitude. The lowest level of closed circulation underneath the upper level cold-core cyclone is often between the 700 and the 500-hectopascal level ( to above sea level). Their life cycles span 5 to 14 days. The upper tropospheric cyclonic centers in the North Atlantic differ from that in the North Pacific. Most of them are detectable in the low tropospheric temperature field as cold troughs in the easterlies. They tend to vertically tilt toward the northeast. Cumulonimbus clouds and rainfall occur in the southeast quadrant, approximately 5° latitude (or ) from the upper cyclone center. Large variations of cloud cover can exist in different systems. The summer tropical upper tropospheric trough is a dominant feature over the trade wind regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, and that the lower tropospheric responses to the tropical upper tropospheric trough in the North Atlantic are differ from those in the North Pacific. Interaction with tropical cyclones outflow channels for Hurricane Dean in August 2007 The summer TUTT in the Southern Hemisphere lies over the trade wind region of the east central Pacific and can cause tropical cyclogenesis offshore Central America. University of Hawaii Professor James C. Sadler has documented tropical cyclones over the eastern North Pacific that were revealed by weather satellite observations, and suggested that the upper-tropospheric circulation is a factor in the development, as well as the life history, of the tropical cyclones. Ralph Huschke and Gary Atkinson proposed that a moist southwest wind that results from southeast trades of the eastern South Pacific deflecting towards the Pacific coasts of Central America between June and November, is known as the \\"temporale\\".14269_239 Temporales are most frequent in July and August, when they can reach gale force and cause rough seas/swell. The area of heavy rain is generally located in the northeast quadrant approximately 5° of latitude (or ) from the eye. In the western Pacific, tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Nina events. Trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process of tropical cyclones. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet stream emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone. In the western North Pacific, there are strong reciprocal relationships between the areas of formative tropical cyclones and that of the lower tropospheric monsoon troughs and the tropical upper tropospheric trough. Tropical cyclone movement can also be influenced by TUTT cells within of their position, which can lead to non-climatological tropical cyclone tracks. Interaction with monsoon regimes As upper level lows retrograde over land masses, they can enhance thunderstorm activity during the afternoon. This magnifies regional monsoon regimes, such as that over western North America near the United States and Mexican border, which can be used to effectively forecast monsoon surges in precipitation magnitude. Across the north Indian Ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.S. Hastenrath (1991). Climate Dynamics of the Tropics.

Both countries have signed diplomatic missions on May 20, 1997. Japan has an embassy in Belgrade and subsequently, Serbia has an embassy in Tokyo and an honorary consulate in Osaka. History In the late 19th century, Japan had emerged from a small, weak island state to the Empire, while Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire and established the Kingdom of Serbia. Through Russia, Serbia had started to set up relations with Japan. However, before 1914, both countries did not have any official relations. =Two World Wars= World War I At World War I, after the Serbian resistance regarding the Austro-Hungarian Army invading Serbia, Japan announced war on the Central Powers in late 1914. From here, Japan began to send aid, materials and supplies to Serbia through the Mediterranean Sea and Russia, growing the relationship between the two countries. Japan also opposed what they called \\"brutal occupation\\" by the Austrians and Bulgarians after they invaded Serbia in 1915. After then, Japan focused their actions mainly in Asia. World War II However, in World War II, Serbia now became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Japan had supported Germany and its ally, making the relationship between the two drop to the lowest point in its history. Yugoslav officials in Japan were expelled out of Japan, as Japan was a part of the Axis. From there, the struggling relations between Japan and Serbia started, with much hostility between both. Until Japan's surrender at 1945, Japan and Serbia kept a negative view of each-other. =Yugoslavia–Japan relations= Josip Broz Tito assumed power after the collapse of the Kingdom and quickly restored back relations with Japan, which was now crumbling. Tito was seen as friendly and good with Japan, as Tito, unlike other Communist leaders, did not side with anyone at that time. Japan and Yugoslavia signed their first treaty of friendship in the late 1950s, and their relations until the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991 were spectacular. Trade and aid Japan is considered one of Serbia's most important trading partners in Asia.Serbia Embassy - Japan- Serbia relations One of the most notable interactions between the two countries took place in 2003 when Japan donated 93 city buses to the city of Belgrade. =Japanese influence on Serbian life= There are a large amount of Serbian expats in Japan, most of them being football players who seek careers in Japan. Many Japanese citizens have also developed respect for Serbians, as Serbia has been seen to them as a \\"good friend\\" and further, a place where the most brave men of the Balkans were born. There are also references to Serbians in Japanese entertainment in areas such as anime and manga. For example, the character Irina Jelavić from Assassination Classroom is of Serbian descent. Even though Japan was an ally with Croatia and Bulgaria during World War II, and is currently an ally of Albania which Serbia has disputed with multiple times, many of Japanese citizens still regard Serbia as a major ally in the region. The famous Serbian slogan \\"Srbija do Tokija\\" also attracts many Japanese people on discovering Serbian history. Kosovo conflict Despite having a relationship with Serbia, Japan, however, also had supported Kosovo's independence.

Life  Duke-Elder was born in the manse in Tealing near Dundee. His father, Rev Neil Stewart Elder, was the village minister of the Free Church of Scotland. His mother was Isabelle Duke, daughter of Rev John Duke of the Free Church in Campsie, Stirlingshire. Duke-Elder was educated at Morgan Academy in Dundee, and was school dux for 1914–1915. Duke-Elder entered the University of St Andrews in 1915 on scholarship, and graduated in 1919 with a BSc in Physiology and MA (Hons) in Natural Sciences. He graduated from the University of St Andrews School of Medicine in 1923 with an MB ChB. In 1925, he earned an MD from St Andrews for his dissertation on 'Reaction of the eye to changes in osmotic pressure of the blood'. Blue plaque, 63 Harley Street, London In 1927, Duke-Elder earned a DSc from St Andrews for his thesis on \\"The nature of the intraocular fluids and the pressure equilibrium in the eye\\". Duke-Elder is best remembered as a talented and prolific writer and editor, producing seven volumes of Textbook of Ophthalmology and fifteen volumes of System of Ophthalmology, along with many other textbooks and scientific papers that provided the educational foundation for most of the world's ophthalmologists. This monumental contribution to medical literature earned Duke-Elder the title of Fellow of the Royal Society in 1960. In addition to his own writings, Duke-Elder served for many years as editor and chairman of the editorial committee of the British Journal of Ophthalmology and Ophthalmic Literature and he was instrumental in the formation and research direction of the Institute of Ophthalmology, now part of the University College London. He was knighted in 1933, and subsequently earned many more honours, serving as the Surgeon-Oculist to King Edward VIII, George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. In 1946 he formed the Faculty of Ophthalmologists. Duke-Elder was awarded the 1957 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 28 March 1958, and was titled 'The Emergence of Vision in the Animal World'. Duke-Elder had a long and successful marriage to his wife Phyllis, who had been his medical assistant. They had no children. Duke-Elder died at his home at St John's Wood in London on 27 March 1978.

The courthouse was listed on the National Register in 1974 as part of the Chardon Courthouse Square District. History Geauga County was established in 1806, settled initially by migrants primarily from New York and New England, part of the northern tier of culture and politics. It was carved out of Trumbull County. The county seat was first placed at New Market, where a courthouse was built. The records about this first courthouse are inconsistent and little is known about it. The next year, the country seat was reassigned to Chardon. 1808 Courthouse, photo of replica built in 1905 Chardon quickly constructed a courthouse, which was completed in 1808. The one-room, log structure with chimney was completely outfitted with wooden amenities. It had split-log benches, rough wood floors and a stick chimney. This courthouse served the county until 1813, when officials agreed a new and sturdier building was needed. Sketch of the 1813 Courthouse The county arranged a competition for the new courthouse. The third courthouse was designed by Samuel King for $750 and was built of brick. The details are vague, as the records are conflicting. Some of its details are enmeshed in the records of the 1826 courthouse. 1826 Courthouse The 1826 Greek Revival courthouse was built of brick, and rose two stories high on a rectangular foundation. Long windows lined the sides of the building and featured a Doric columned portico. The hipped roof was pierced by a cupola topped by a spire. In 1848, the building was adapted for use also as the new Chardon Library, the first branch of today's Geauga County Public Library. Main Street after the fire of 1868 In July 1868 a massive fire broke out in downtown, destroying the courthouse and almost every other building along Main Street.Terrible Conflagration – The Entire Business Portion of Chardon, Ohio, in Ashes – Loss Over $100,000 New York Times, August 1, 1868. However, none of its important records were lost. Arson was suspected but never proven. The county soon ran a competition for the design of its fourth courthouse. The design chosen was by Joseph Ireland. The construction contract was awarded to L.J. Randall. Randall died in 1869 and the project was then overseen by the Meadville, Pennsylvania construction firm of Carpenter and Matthews, whom Randall had hired as builders,Stith, Bari Oyler, (June 15, 1995). \\"For the Record: the Courthouse Series, 1869 - Building a Courthouse for Chardon.\\" Geauga Courier, p. 25. The brick and stone structure was built at a price of $88,862. The courthouse standing today is basically the same, although renovations have added some minor interior alterations and upgrades. Exterior 1869 Courthouse under construction The courthouse features red brick exterior with light sandstone quoins. The building contains a central projection, also framed by quoins. The windows on the first floor are low arched windows on either side of the projection. The second-floor windows are interesting as the windows contain long arched windows with circular windows above with smaller circular tracings. The whole window is framed by a sandstone casing and white wooden trim. The flat roof rests on an entablature with decorative brackets. The tower consists of an octagonal louvered cupola and a dome with four teardrop shaped clock faces and a weathervane topping the central spire. The entrance contains double doors topped by a fanlight. Above the door is a balcony lined with wrought iron railings. A central window is located in the middle of the tower with two long arched windows, each topped with circular windows like the ones above the second floor windows. The entire building, base to weathervane is tall.http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Courthouses/geauga.asp In 1974 the courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as part of the Chardon Courthouse Square District. Renovations The courthouse has undergone several revisions since its initial construction. It was wired for electricity in 1898 and central heating was installed in 1902.Beech, Maud (July 26, 1962). \\"Historic Court House Began in Log Cabin.\\" The Times Leader and Record, p.30. An elevator to the third floor was added in 1960, and in 1965, the second-floor courtroom underwent major renovations, including the removal of the dome in its ceiling. This created enough room above it for the addition of a second courtroom on the third floor, which housed the county's probate courtNewman, Paul (February 27, 1981). \\"County Courthouse History,\\" County Courthouse History file, Geauga County Archives and Records Center..

The unit cell is a parallelepiped defined by the lengths of its edges a, b, c and angles between them \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma. General case Consider a system of periodic structure in space and use {\\\\mathbf a} , \\\\mathbf b, and \\\\mathbf c as the three independent period vectors, forming a right-handed triad, which are also the edge vectors of a cell of the system. Then any vector \\\\mathbf r in Cartesian coordinates can be written as a linear combination of the period vectors : {\\\\mathbf r} = u {\\\\mathbf a} + v {\\\\mathbf b} + w {\\\\mathbf c}. Our task is to calculate the scalar coefficients known as fractional coordinates u, v, and w, assuming \\\\mathbf r, \\\\mathbf a, \\\\mathbf b, and \\\\mathbf c are known. For this purpose, let us calculate the following cell surface area vector : \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} = {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf c} , then : {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} = 0 , {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} = 0 , and the volume of the cell is : \\\\Omega = {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a}. If we do a vector inner (dot) product as follows :\\\\begin{align} {\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} &= u {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} + v {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} + w {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= u {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= u \\\\Omega, \\\\end{align} then we get : u = \\\\frac 1 \\\\Omega {{\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf a}}. Similarly, : \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf a} , {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = 0 , {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = 0 , {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = \\\\Omega , : {\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = u {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} + v {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} + w {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = v {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b} = v \\\\Omega, we arrive at : v = \\\\frac 1 \\\\Omega {{\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf b}} , and : \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf b} , {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = 0 , {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = 0 , {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = \\\\Omega , : {\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = u {\\\\mathbf a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} + v {\\\\mathbf b} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} + w {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = w {\\\\mathbf c} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c} = w \\\\Omega, : w = \\\\frac 1 \\\\Omega {{\\\\mathbf r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathbf c}}.

Jones played an officer aboard the fictional U.S. Navy destroyer USS Appleby, which roamed the Pacific Ocean. Cast Applebys crew included: *Jack Mullaney as 24-year-old Lieutenant Rex St. John, wealthy, handsome, and ambitious but vain *Jay C. Flippen as the cantankerous Chief Petty Officer Homer Nelson *Jack Albertson as Lieutenant Commander Virgil Stoner, the ship's executive officer who delivered orders from the ship's unseen captain, heard only over speakers *Harvey Lembeck as Seaman Gabby Di Julio *Beau Bridges as Seaman Howard Spicer *Robert Sorrells as Seaman Claude White *John McGiver as Stone's brother-in-law, the psychologist Arthur Ainsley, who argued that the ship's crew was unhappy and hiding deep-seated depression.TV.com: Ensign O'Toole:http://www.tv.com/ensign- otoole/show/4531/summary.html http://www.tvacres.com/military_ensignotoole.htm *Ken Berry as Lt. Melton / Calucci Series background Ensign O'Toole was based on All the Ships at Sea and Ensign O'Toole and Me, two books by William Lederer, who served as a consultant on the series. Though there was no second season of production, Ensign O'Toole was repeated on NBC through September 15, 1963, and ABC aired reruns of the show from March to September 1964. The real- life U.S. Navy destroyer , which was launched on October 3, 1944, and commissioned on February 3, 1945, portrayed Appleby. On June 3, 1969, Frank E. Evans was cut in half in a collision with the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne with the loss of 74 of her crew. Her bow sank almost immediately, and her stern was sunk as a target in Subic Bay in the Philippines. Ensign O'Toole was aired opposite CBS's Lassie at the 7 p.m. Eastern time slot on Sundays. ABC that season aired repeats of Father Knows Best in the same time slot.1962-1963 American television network schedule Selected episodes During her tour of duty, Appleby anchored in numerous ports: Hong Kong, South Korea, the Arctic, the South Pacific, and its home port, San Diego, California. The opening episode entitled \\"Operation Kowana\\" introduces the cast. The sailors are given shore leave with a stern warning to mind their behavior when they land in the Japanese port of Kowana.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Stage/2950%3FUS/Comedy/EnsignOToole.htm%3F200&date;=2009-10-25+11:10:48 The second episode, \\"Operation Model T\\", which aired on September 30, 1962, Terence O'Toole buys a Model T on a French island in the South Pacific and camouflages it in pieces aboard the ship. After reaching California, O'Toole has the car reassembled, and an admiral, who is an antique car collector, sees it on the dock and thus foils the ensign's plans. In the third episode, October 7, 1962, entitled \\"Operation Daddy\\", O'Toole has to assemble emergency leave papers for Seaman White, whose wife in Omaha, Nebraska, is about to give birth. In \\"Operation Benefit\\" (October 14, 1962), while Appleby was in South Korea, Ensign O'Toole and the crew put on the \\"Foster Father's Follies\\" show to raise money to adopt Korean orphans. The Kim Sisters provided the entertainment. Dick Powell (1904-1963), owner of Four Star Television, which produced the series, guest starred in the episode.Internet Movie Data Base: Ensign O'Toole:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055671/ At the time of his appearance, Powell had fewer than three months to live. Soupy Sales guest starred in \\"Operation Jinx\\" on October 21, 1962, as Seaman Jerome J. Johnson. Chief Nelson warns of trouble because Johnson is believed to be a bad-luck omen. In \\"Operation Holdout\\" on October 28, 1962, the crew found four stranded soldiers, two American and two Japanese, who think World War II is still underway. Harry Morgan (1915–2011), later Colonel Sherman T. Potter on CBS's M*A*S*H*, appeared in \\"Operation Mess\\" on November 18, 1962. O'Toole is puzzled why the crew is grumbling about the food when Charlie was previously known as a superior chef. Ken Berry's character refers to O'Toole's first name as Terence. In \\"Operation Potomac\\" on December 9, 1962, with guest star Richard Eastham, O'Toole tries to determine why someone sent him a dress while the ship is in port near Washington, D.C. The unsolicited gift inspired much ribbing from his fellow crew members. Eventually, O'Toole learns the dress was for a female naval officer with the same name assigned to the same installation. \\"Operation Gaslight\\" on December 16, 1962, featured Steve Franken, Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., in CBS's The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, as Ensign Bender, a by-the-book sailor from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. O'Toole decides to \\"initiate\\" Bender by convincing him that he has contracted an unusual nautical disease. In \\"Operation Swindle\\" on December 30, 1962, Rosemary De Camp, who played the sister of Bob Cummings in an earlier NBC comedy series, guest starred as a Southern belle who strips Chief Nelson of his bank book. \\"Operation Intrigue\\" on January 13, 1963, is set in Hong Kong, then a British colony. O'Toole volunteered to help Scotland Yard find a jewel thief by going undercover. \\"Operation Royalty\\" on January 27, 1963, offers Dennis Cross in the role of the \\"Captain of the Guard\\". In \\"Operation: Arrivederci\\" on March 5, 1963, O'Toole tries to help a struggling artist, an attractive young woman. He once again mentions his name is Terence. In \\"Operation Stowaway\\" on March 24, 1963, Nita Talbot appears as Grapunia, a young girl who stows away on the Appleby, and the crew goes overboard to win her favor. In \\"Operation: Physical\\", a conversation between O'Toole and St. John reveals that the two officers are twenty-four years of age. O'Toole remarks that St. John wouldn't like to be in the position of Lieutenant Commander Virgil Stoner, commanding junior officers half his age. St. John jokes that he wouldn't like that either, \\"who wants to be on the ship with a bunch of twelve-year old officers?\\" The episode later features a short cameo by Gary Crosby, playing a friend of O'Toole's masquerading as a doctor. In \\"Operation Tubby\\" on April 14, 1963, Stubby Kaye (1918-1997) guest starred as Tubby Mason, a compulsive eater on the verge of being discharged from the Navy for obesity. He is ordered to go on a crash diet. The final episode, \\"Operation Geisha\\", has Jack Carter as a con man who must return money to an irate victim. He and a partner open a reverse geisha house.

It helps third-party developers modify and add functionality to applications developed with the Cocoa environment without access to the source code. SIMBL loads code via the InputManager system, which was developed to support foreign input methods. Plugins using SIMBL have advantages over normal InputManager modifications such as targeted code loading into specific applications. Designed for Solomon's PithHelmet, SIMBL is now used by other developers. The most popular use of SIMBL is to add functionality to the Apple Safari web browser which did not have an Apple-authorized plugin system until version 5 in 2010. SIMBL was developed in response to the restrictive licensing and costs of Application Enhancer and the drawbacks of loading code blindly through the InputManager mechanism.Solomon, Mike 2006. SIMBL, http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php Installation SIMBL is installed like any other InputManager. As such, it is restricted to certain locations depending on the version of Mac OS X installed. In default installations, it is located in /Library/InputManagers. In versions of Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X Leopard, SIMBL could be installed per-user.Oddgard, Alllen, 2007, \\"InputManagers on Leopard\\" http://blog.macromates.com/2007/inputmanagers-on-leopard/ In plugin installations, the SIMBL package is automatically installed. Since SIMBL injects code into running processes, buggy plugins can cause process- or even systemwide problems.Apple Inc, 2003 \\"Safari 1.1: Safari Quits Unexpectedly When PithHelmet Is Installed\\" , http://support.apple.com/kb/TA21363?viewlocale=en_USNevyn, 2006 \\"Fixing God's Problems\\" Plugins Plugins for SIMBL are Cocoa bundles that add various functionality to Cocoa applications. They can be placed by the user manually through Finder or by an installer to /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins. It may also be placed in the user-specific home directories. =Advantages over InputManager Plugins= SIMBL bundles may be disabled by removing the plugin and restarting the application. With normal InputManager hacks, the user must log out and log in. Also, the normal InputManager mechanism is loaded for all Cocoa applications, providing the possibility of incompatibility and unexpected application behavior. SIMBL only loads bundles for specific and identified applications. Leopard restrictions on InputManager plugins mean their installation can only be done system-wide. SIMBL plugins may be installed per-user if SIMBL is installed system-wide. =Update Compatibility= SIMBL plugins must specify which versions of the application that they will run with; running a more recent version of the application with the plugin activated will cause an error dialog to appear.Bohon, Cory, 2008. \\"SIMBL Plug-in woes after 10.5.3\\" http://www.tuaw.com/2008/05/28/simbl-plug-in-woes-after-10-5-3/ Like all unsupported hacks, the amount of work required to update a plugin depends on the size of the update.Solomon, Mike 2007. 14 Nov 2007, \\"TerminalColors in Leopard\\" http://www.culater.net/thc/index.php?entry=/Development/terminal_colors_leopard.txt =Development= Development of SIMBL plugins require knowledge of Cocoa reverse-engineering.

Description The jerk is similar to the monkey. The arms move and hands move as if conducting. The wrists cross in front of the chest and then sweep out in time, or at Half time (music), with the music. The hands are up at face level. On count 1, the outward sweep, the hands are quickly pushed out, giving the jerky motion. For a little more style, the fingers may be snapped on the two outward movements—the first and third counts of the hand motion. Songs featuring or suggesting the dance Released as a single in 1964 on the Money record label, \\"The Jerk\\" was a hit for the Los Angeles band the Larks. In the same year, the Miracles wrote and recorded \\"Come on Do the Jerk\\". The Capitols performed a 1966 hit song called \\"Cool Jerk\\", written to capitalize on the dance's popularity. The song has been covered by several bands, including the Go-Go's. The band Rocket from the Crypt recorded the song \\"When in Rome, Do the Jerk\\" in 1998 as a homage to the dance.

Channel 3 is operated by Grupo Televisión Litoral alongside two radio stations, Plus FM on 93.1 MHz FM and Radio 2 on 1230 kHz AM. History LT 83 TV received its federal license in August 1964 and signed on June 20, 1965, some years after shareholders explored the foundation of a television station. It moved its studios several times in the 1960s and early 1970s to cope with a growing demand for television in the region. Channel 3 started broadcasting in color on May 1, 1980, using the PAL-N system as with every other TV station in the country. Full color programming began with a military parade on June 20 of that year. The station also produced such important local programming as the matches held in Rosario during the 1978 FIFA World Cup and Pope John Paul II's visit to the city in 1987. In 2007, LT 83 suffered the second tower collapse in its history, causing damage to the station's studios. In 2011, it rebranded as El Tres. In 2015, after the death of owner Alberto Casiano Gollán, a 55% share in Televisión Litoral, the license holder, was sold to local businessmen associated with the Fundación Libertad group, for around US$13 million. Currently, the station operates with a 30 kW transmitter, using four translators to reach all the province. Programming Channel 3 holds an affiliation with Artear's El Trece and primarily airs its national programs. However, it also is involved in the production of local news and other programs. The local news on El Tres tends to focus specifically on the Rosario metropolitan area, with little if any coverage of southern Santa Fe province or the cities where repeaters are located. Local programs include Antes de salir, a morning show, De 12 a 14 at midday and a local version of Telenoche aired at night. See alsoTelefe Rosario, Channel 3's only competitor.

Encouraged to travel for two years by his concerned father, Knox hoped to see Mexico but was lucky to survive a shipwreck off Yucatán. Continuing to the United States, he decided to prepare for ordination in France. Invited to Rome for papal instruction by John Henry Newman in 1847, Knox proceeded as an Oratorian novice, taking Francis as his name in religion, as Father Francis Knox, with half a dozen priests. The rest of his life centred on the Oratorian group in England.Reader website The group based at the Birmingham Oratory divided in April 1849. Together with Faber, Knox set up the London Oratory. The splitting up of the original Oratorian group was partly driven by personal difficulties, and in particular Newman’s attitude to Knox, who was proving troublesome.Sheridan Gilley, Newman and His Age (1990), p. 267.

Early life Graham was born in the summer of 1959 in Woodberry Down or Harrow, London to William Frederick and Louisa Graham (née Neron or Heron).Birth Registration, Hackney, London, General Register Office, Southport, England1861 England, Scotland and Wales census, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey. On December 8, 1880, he received a B.A. from New College, Oxford.Oxford graduation announcements in the Ecclesiastical Gazette, January 15, 1881 He continued as a law student and in late December 1882 passed the exam at the Middle Temple to become a barrister.Calls to the Bar in The Solicitors' Journal and Reporter, Volume 27 (1883) pp. 184 and 234. Graham is known to have climbed extensively in the Alps, reaching most of the major summits. On August 20, 1882, Auguste Cupelin Alphonse Payot, and he made the official first ascent of the Dent du Géant, considered the last major price in the Alps. While they used the fixed ropes and iron stanchions put in place over a four-day period by Jean Joseph and Baptiste Maquignaz, who twice concluded there ascent three to four weeks before at the slightly lower Point Sella (named after their clients), Graham's party's crossing of an 'extremely awkward notch' to the higher Point Graham was marked by the British alpine community as the end of the silver age of alpinism. Nevertheless, his application to join the Alpine Club was rejected for reasons which are unclear, but the size of the majority against him suggests that he had made influential enemies. Himalayan expedition In 1883, shortly after he had qualified as a barrister, Graham made a visit to the Himalayas in the company of Swiss Alpine guide Josef Imboden of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. While many of the lower mountains of the Himalaya had been climbed by surveyors and explorers, mainly to make observations of more distant peaks, Graham was the first person to visit the range solely for the purpose of mountaineering. He spent the spring trekking in the region of Kanchenjunga, but he was forced to return to Darjeeling by the cold weather and the fact that a porter had accidentally burned his boots. By then, Imboden had contracted fever and opted to go home. Once in Darjeeling, Graham contacted the Grindelwald climber Emil Boss to find him another guide. Instead, Boss decided to join together with his hometown guide Ulrich Kaufmann, with whom he had nearly completed the first ascent of New Zealand's Mount Cook the previous year.The late Emil Boss, of \\"The Bear\\", The Press, 7 November 1888. At the end of June the party set off for Garhwal where they explored the region around Nanda Devi. Unable to penetrate the Nanda Devi Sanctuary they turned their attention towards Dunagiri, where Graham claimed to have reached a height of around 22,700 ft (6,920 m) before being forced to retreat by bad weather.Unsworth (1994) p. 233 Graham and his companions next attempted a nearby peak, which they believed was the one marked on the map as A21, now known as Changabang. They made an ascent by the West Ridge, which Graham described as \\"a fair climb, but [one that] presented no great difficulties.\\"Quoted in Unsworth (1994), p. 234 Modern observers, however, agree that whatever mountain Graham climbed it was not Changabang, which from the west presents a sheer wall which was not climbed until 1976, and certainly not the easy ridge that Graham described.Unsworth (1994), p. 234 It is more likely that he was on the wrong mountain; possibly a subsidiary summit on the southern ridge of Dunagiri. Reprinted 1987 by Diadem Books, Graham's confusion was partly due to the poor quality of the maps of the area, and on his return to civilisation he was critical of the Great Trigonometric Survey, suggesting that its surveyors should be trained in mountaineering by the Swiss Army, whom he credited with the finest cartographic work in the world at the time. The criticism was not well received by the Survey, and it may have made Graham more enemies to cast doubt on his accomplishments. Kabru, which Graham claimed to have climbed. After the Garhwal trip, Graham and his companions returned to the Kanchenjunga area for the climax of their campaign; an attempt on Kabru, which Graham claimed to have climbed by the East Face in three days, reaching the summit on 8 September.Unsworth (1994), p. 235 After Kabru, Graham attempted several other mountains in the area, but the onset of winter prevented him from making serious progress on any of them. Kabru, at 7,349 m (24,111 ft), was far higher than any other mountain climbed at the time, and its ascent was and remains the most controversial aspect of Graham's expedition. Doubt was cast on whether he really had climbed this mountain or whether he had mistaken a nearby, lower mountain called Forked Peak (6,200 m, 20,340 ft) for Kabru. His ascent was doubted by members of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, whose maps of the area Graham had criticized in his June 1884 presentation at the Royal Geographical Society, and by a few contemporaries including Martin Conway and William Hunter Workman, both of whom had rival (lower) claims to the world altitude record.Unsworth (1994), p. 236 However, it was supported by climbers such as Norman Collie, Thomas Longstaff, Douglas Freshfield, and Carl Rubenson – Freshfield having travelled extensively in the same area himself and Rubenson having reached the same point on Kabru in 1907. In his 1955 history of Himalayan climbing Kenneth Mason argued that Graham had not climbed Kabru, pointing to the vagueness of his description of the mountain, inconsistencies between his account and modern observations of the mountain, the remarkably quick ascent he claimed, and the fact that he appeared to have suffered little or no altitude sickness on his ascent.Mason, p.94 In a more recent history, Walt Unsworth argued that the vagueness of Graham's account was to be expected from a man who was a mountaineer rather than a surveyor, and that now Mount Everest has been climbed in a single day without oxygen, Graham's claims seem less outlandish than they once did, so that he should perhaps be credited with the ascent after all. In a 10-page analysis in 2009, Blaser and Hughes argued that \\"it is time to put the doubts to rest, and give Graham, Boss and Kauffmann their due credit for an extraordinary achievement\\". Later life He disappeared from mountaineering history after his year in the Himalayas and after making his initial report of his Himalayan expedition he never made any further comment or engaged in the ensuing controversy. For many years it was rumoured that he lost all his money and ended his days as a cowboy in the United States.Blaser & Hughes, p. 224 footnote, quoting Walt Unsworth’s Encyclopaedia of Mountaineering (1992) Instead, he had soon moved to Mexico, where in October 1888 he obtained the rights to explore and exploit up to 30 mines in a 600 km2 area of Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyons) in Chihuahua.Mining concession to William Woodman Graham in Recopilacion de leyes, decretos y providencias de los poderes legislativo y ejecutivo de la union, Volume 52, Imprenta del Gobierno, en Palacio, 1889, Decree 197, pp. 913-24.

Independent comparisons of FT to alternative approachesI. Grossman and M. Mah, \\"Independent Research Study of Software Reuse\\", tech. report, QSM Associates, 1994 confirm that the time and resources needed to build and maintain complex systems can be substantially reduced. One reason: FT shields programmers from software's inherent redundancies: FT has reproduced COTS object-libraries from equivalent XVCL frame libraries that are two-thirds smaller and simpler; custom business applications are routinely specified and maintained by Netron FusionSPC frames that are 5% – 15% of the size of their assembled source files. Frames Below are two informal descriptions, followed by a more precise definition and explanation. #A frame is an adaptable component on an automated software assembly line. Imagine an auto factory where, instead of having specific bumpers, fenders, and other parts to suit the specifics of each car model, we have just one generic bumper, one generic fender, and so on. Now imagine that these generic parts could be cloned and shaped to fit each car model as it came down the line. Such a fantasy would revolutionize manufacturing; and while impossible for physical parts, this is what frames do for software (and information in general). #A frame is a recipe for \\"cooking up\\" a (program) text. Its instructions say how to blend its ingredients – chunks of frame-text within itself – with the ingredients from other frames. The “chef” is a frame processor that carries out the instructions, i.e. the frame commands, which alter (add, modify, delete) ingredients as necessary, to suit the main recipe. Formally, a frame is a procedural macro consisting of frame-text – zero or more lines of ordinary (program) text and frame commands (that are carried out by FT's frame processor as it manufactures custom programs). Each frame is both a generic component in a hierarchy of nested subassemblies, and a procedure for integrating itself with its subassembly frames (a recursive process that resolves integration conflicts in favor of higher level subassemblies). The outputs are custom documents, typically compilable source modules. =The main commands=invoke a frame (a procedure call that occurs at construction time, while constructing program texts); *assign a (list of) expression(s) to a frame parameter (a construction-time variable assignment); *insert frame-text before, instead-of, or after blocks of frame-text, labeled by parameter expressions; *instantiate a frame parameter (a construction-time expression evaluation); *select frame-texts for processing (a construction- time case statement); *iterate a frame-text while varying certain frame parameters (a construction-time while statement). The processor transforms frame-text by replacing commands with ordinary text, and by emitting ordinary text as is. Examples: It replaces an invoke by the result of processing the invoked frame; it replaces an assign with nothing; and an instantiate becomes the ordinary text resulting from evaluating the frame parameter's assigned expression, which can be a concatenation of strings, arithmetic expressions, and nested frame parameters. =Component relationships= frame Invoke sets up component relationships among frames. For example, in figure 1: F is J’s component and C is J’s subcomponent. Of course, many components may invoke the same subcomponent, as in I and J invoking F, each constructing a different text. The overall component structure forms a generic semilattice,The semilattice is generic because its nodes and graph structure can vary, depending on parameter values. with each frame being the root of a subassembly. Thus C is its own subassembly; F and C are components of the F subassembly, and J, F, and C are components of the J subassembly.The ambiguity reflects the mental habit of thinking of a subassembly as one component. Context scoping Context scoping is what distinguishes FT from other modeling and construction systems: Each frame constitutes the context into which it integrates its subassembly. In nested subassemblies the lower levels are progressively more context-free because they integrate less information. Integration conflicts are resolved in favor of the most context-sensitive frame to assign or insert a parameter – it becomes read-only to all other frames in that frame's subassembly.Non-nested subassemblies can reassign the same parameter. In figure 1, frames F and C would conflict if they assign different values to parameter p. So F overrides C – i.e., the frame processor ignores C’s assignment(s) to p, and uses F’s value(s) for p in F and C. Similarly, J can override both F and C, and so on. Context-scoping matters because all the adjustments needed to fit any number of (sub)components to a given context are explicit and local to that context. Without context-scoping such adjustments are mostly implicit, scattered and hidden within component variants. Not only do such variants tend to proliferate, causing unnecessary redundancy and complexity, but system evolution is also unnecessarily difficult and error-prone. Specification frames and templates A specification frame (SPC) is an entire assembly's topmost, hence most context- sensitive frame. The processor starts at an SPC, such as L or M in figure 1, in order to manufacture a complete program or subsystem. While in principle an SPC could customize every detail, in practice an SPC is a small fraction of its entire assembly because most of the exceptions (and exceptions to exceptions, etc.) have already been handled by various subassembly frames. Given a frame library, SPCs logically entail the programs they construct; thus SPCs replace source files as primary control points. It's routine practice to use templates to create SPCs that create programs, then use SPCs to manage and evolve those programs indefinitely. This practice greatly reduces the number of details that application programmers must know and manage. It also avoids the redundancies, complexities, and errors inherent in copying and editing source texts by hand. Debugging time shrinks as well because most components are reused, hence pretested. Errors tend to localize in SPCs, as they are the least tested. A template is an archetypal SPC, with embedded comments explaining how to customize it. Typically, there is a small number of types of programs, each type being characterized by a template. By copying and filling it in, programmers convert a template into an SPC without having to remember what frames they need, their component relationships, or what details typically need to be customized. Frame-based domain-specific languages An FT-based, domain-specific language (FT-DSL) is a domain-specific language whose semantics (expressed in program code) have been engineered into frames. A typical FT-DSL editor translates between DSL expressions and a frame that will adapt the framed semantics to express program-code equivalents of the DSL expressions. An SPC sitting atop this subassembly can then specify in program code any customizations inexpressible in the domain-specific language. Thus when users regenerate program code from altered DSL expressions, prior customizations are not lost.Hand editing the same customizations into regenerated code again and again spurred the invention of FT. Frame engineering Frame engineering applies software engineering to a frame technology environment. This includes domain analysis, designing, writing, testing, and co-evolving frames along with the systems they construct. Framing occurs both bottom–up and top–down. Bottom–up, frame engineers typically create frames by unifying and parameterizing groups of similar program elements (of any granularity, from text snippets to subsystems) into generic equivalents. The top–down approach combines domain expertise with iterative prototype refinement, constrained by application and architectural requirements, corporate standards, and the desire to evolve a set of reusable assets whose return greatly exceeds the investment. (Reuse is measured by dividing the total size of the frame libraries into the total size of the resulting constructs, and/or by counting individual frame reuses.) A mature frame library enhances cost-effectiveness because software project stakeholders can restrict their attention to a system's novelties, taking the bulk of its robust components and architecture for granted. A mature library is not static. Frame engineers can, using the select command, evolve reusable frames indefinitely, meeting new requirements without necessitating retrofits to programs manufactured from frames’ previous versions.

Career Stringfellow was born in Walkden in Lancashire and began his career playing for local team Walkden Town. He had a short spell with Manchester City but never played a match for the club. He moved to nearby Oldham Athletic in December 1958. An inside forward, he spent two seasons with the club, playing 54 times in the Football League and scoring 16 goals. He was the team's top scorer during the 1959–60 season with 11 goals, but was then forced to leave the club when he was posted to Malaya with the Royal Air Force. He later played for the non-league club GKN Sankey, based in Wellington, Shropshire, and then, upon leaving the Air Force, joined Gillingham in December 1962. He made his debut for the club the following April in a home match against Newport County. In the 1963–64 season he made 25 appearances and helped the club to win the championship of the Football League Fourth Division.

She has been a Member of the Riksdag, representing her home constituency of Jönköping County, since 2006, and leader of the Centre Party since 2011. Lööf served as Minister for Enterprise from 2011 to 2014, in the later Reinfeldt Cabinet. Early life and career Annie Lööf was born and raised in the small village of Maramö, near Värnamo. At school in the 1990s, she shared a class with children of refugees fleeing wars in the Balkans.Johan Ahlander and Simon Johnson (18 January 2019), Braving outrage, Swedish liberal Loof dumps partners to block populists Reuters. During her last year at Finnvedens Secondary School in Värnamo, where she studied social sciences, she developed an interest in politics. Political career =Early beginnings= At the end of 2001 Lööf joined the Centre Party. During the 2002 general election she was employed as an election agent for the party's youth organization (CUF) in Jönköping County and in the same year she won a Dag Hammarskjöld Scholarship, which gave her the chance to immerse herself in international peace and environmental issues at the UN Headquarters in New York. After the election she enrolled to study law at Lund University and was awarded a professional degree in law (LL.M.) in August 2011. =Member of Parliament, 2006–present= In the general election of 2006 Lööf was elected to the Riksdag, being at that time the youngest member of the legislature. In January 2007, together with her colleague Fredrick Federley, Lööf initiated the Liberal Group, a network of liberal-minded people both inside and outside the Riksdag. She has also been the vice president of CUF. For several years she served on the board of the Nordic Centre Youth Federation, Scandinavia's second largest youth organization. In 2008 Lööf was awarded the \\"Young European Leadership Program\\" grant from the United States Embassy. Before she became a minister and party leader, Annie Lööf was member of the Committee on Finance, the War Delegation and a vicepresident of the Committee on Justice and first Deputy House Leader for the Centre Party's parliamentary group and member of the party's executive board. She has served as a member on several government commissions, including the E-Publicity Committee, the investigation of the police needs of signal intelligence and in the signals intelligence committee, which evaluated the National Defence Radio Establishment activities. During her two terms, she has been active in municipal politics in Värnamo, as deputy of the City Council from 2002 to 2004, as member of the Citizens' Board from 2002 to 2004, as well as ordinary municipal councillor from 2006 to 2007. Lööf was also elected to the local councils for Värnamo in 2010, but left the mission because of many national commitments. Until 2008 Lööf was a substitute to the Nordic Council's Swedish delegation, and the pre- term in office she worked for the Committee on the Constitution as a member. After the 2010 general election, Lööf was elected chairman of the National Post-Election Analysis Group the Centre Party appointed. The Analysis Group presented its report in January 2011. The same year she became Spokesperson for Financial and Economic Affairs of her party. On 31 August 2011 the Centre Partys Nomination Commité proposed Annie Lööf as the Party President and on the party's congress in Åre on 23 September she was elected by acclamation. =Leader of the Centre Party, 2011–present= Lööf at the \\"Stora Tillväxtdagen\\" (Major Growth Day) in April 2012. Lööf was elected leader and party president on 23 September 2011, succeeding Maud Olofsson, at the party congress in Åre. She thus became the Centre Party's youngest-ever party leader. On 29 September 2011 Lööf succeeded Maud Olofsson as Minister for Business and Enterprise. She also saw to replace Minister for the Environment Andreas Carlgren with Lena Ek, former MEP, and gave birth for to new cabinet post Minister for IT and Energy who Anna-Karin Hatt (former candidate for the party leadership) was given. The Minister for Rural and Farming Affairs, Eskil Erlandsson kept his seat. During Almedalsveckan 2012, in her address at the Centre Party gathering, Lööf criticized the government of which she was a part for its inability to keep up the pace of reform that had been a leading part of the Alliance platform in 2006, and urged a revival. \\"The joint project has lost momentum. Project embers have died down,\\" she said. These points were met with fierce opposition from the other cabinet parties, mainly from the Christian Democrats and the party secretary Acko Ankarberg. The speech also drew attention because of the caustic review by Social Democrat former minister of culture Marita Ulvskog: \\"New speechwriter for Annie Lööf? unfortunately didn't help. Credibility none. Would work in Top Model, not in reality\\" she wrote on Twitter. Ulvskog later apologized for some of the wording. On 6 August 2012 Lööf dismissed Christina Lugnet, the Director- General of Tillväxtverket, after it had become known that Lugnet's government agency had spent approximately 16 million SEK on mostly internal representation over a brief period of time: banquets, kick-offs, hotel stays for its personnel and conferences. This was out of bounds under Swedish law and by the agency's own rules. On 8 August, it became known that Lööf used taxpayers' money for a number of restaurant visits, including banquets for her staff. A memo was revealed to have amounted 20 000 SEK. The Centre Party has subsequently repaid these expenses to the treasury, as it was for party activities. After the parliamentary election in 2014, Lööf's trust figures raised dramatically. In 2017, Annie Lööf had the highest trust figures of any major political party leader in Sweden by Swedish voters. In June 2017, Lööf attended the Bilderberg Meeting in Chantilly, Virginia, in the United States.

Penlle'r Castell is located 1213 feet above sea level.Glamorgan Walks - Lliw Valley The meaning of the name in English is \\"summit of the place of the castle\\". History It has been suggested that the castle may have been established by William de Braose, 2nd Baron Braose in the years immediately preceding 1252. However, there is no firm evidence as to the date of its construction, but it is believed to be the fortification referred to as the \\"New Castle of Gower\\" which was attacked and destroyed in 1252. There is only one other castle of that period in the northern uplands of Gower, Cae Castell, and its location and form preclude it being the \\"new castle\\" in question. Penlle'r Castell is in an ideal position for monitoring the actions of the lords of Is Cennan, resident on the north side of the River Amman, and preventing their encroachment into northern Gower via this important ridge route. It would have been a purely military fortification, a blockhouse from which a troop of mounted men could harry raiding parties and send warnings to Swansea of any military incursions.

The complex features 3 office towers, a hotel, an open-air retail plaza, and a 1200-car parking garage. City Square was designed by the architectural firm of Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Fairburn. The towers were constructed in 1962, 1964, and 1971. 3800 Tower is ; 3838 Tower is ; and 4000 Tower is 295,797 square feet. There is also a large Fitness Center, known as Sports Club at City Square, that is part of the complex. Phoenix City Square is on Central Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona. The Metro Light Rail track runs down this portion of Central Avenue. This project is part of the Valley Metro system. On December 27, 2008, Valley Metro Light Rail officially opened. It remains to be seen if this will have an impact in increasing tenancy at City Square, though it will serve to connect the area to Downtown Phoenix. There are a variety of businesses that are part of the complex. Besides having a fitness center, there are also cafes, a day care, a barber shop, law offices, accounting firms, engineering consultants, etc. There is also an on-site U.S. Bank as part of the City Square area. History The plot of land used to develop the Rosenzweig Center had been owned by the Rosenzweig family for 46 years when construction began in 1961. Portions of the property were formerly occupied by the Mirador Ballroom and a yard owned by Superlite Builders Supply Co. on the north portion. The Webb Corporation planned the complex as a \\"dramatic, high quality, self-contained complex of buildings around a landscaped plaza that, in time, will mean to this area (downtown Phoenix) what New York's Rockefeller Center or Philadelphia's Penn Center means to the East.\\" The project was announced by the Webb Corporation on June 10, 1961. The complex was built as the Rosenzweig Center and was originally owned by North Central Development Co., a partnership of Newton and Harry Rosenzweig, prominent jewelers in the Phoenix area, and the Del Webb Corporation in Phoenix. In 1983, the property was sold to Canadian entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke, and was subsequently renamed Kent Plaza. In 1985, Kent Plaza was sold to Merrill Lynch Hubbard, a real-estate subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. Merril Lynch subsequently renamed the complex Phoenix City Square. In 1987 Merrill Lynch invested heavily in refreshing the property, heavily renovating the exteriors of all three towers, the plaza, and the landscaping. The past couple decades have seen a lot of activity around the City Square development.

A new hotel tower was also constructed south of the pool, bringing the total room count to 383. In July 1981, Ramada Inns took over management of the property from the Webb Corporation and it was subsequently renamed the Ramada townhouse. Ramada had initially intended to remodel the property as a Ramada Renaissance property; however, these plans did not come to fruition. Ramada ceased managing the property on October 31, 1983. Management was turned over to LaMancha Racquet Club Inc. in November 1983. LaMancha closed the property for renovation and reopened in July 1984 as the LaMancha Athletic Club and Hotel. During the renovation the rooms and facilities in the 23-story tower were removed and replaced with office space, lowering the room count to 171. The ballroom was converted into the LaMancha Athletic Club, featuring racquetball courts, a basketball court, Nautilus Conditioning room and an indoor swimming pool.

Envy, jealousy, and selfishness, such dark sides of humans can be seen in the work. The artist said that he wants to create the world of heroes with Korean identity. It won the first prize and Netizen's Choice Award at the 1st SICAF International Digital Cartoon Competition held in 2006. Mr. Go was awarded with ten million won. The panel stated that they easily reached to choose it as the grand prix because not only it scored the highest point in the netizens' recommended works but also it fully meets the required criteria; characteristics of web manhwa technique, and artistic features. Since April 2007 this manhwa had been featured on Daum, one of major internet portals of South Korea that is being considered a birthplace of many hit webtoons. Plot The story is set in contemporary South Korea. Some 30 years ago, unidentified creatures appeared out of nowhere and attacked mankind. They caused massive destruction wherever they went. The monsters are called \\"Troubles\\", and caused the world to fall into chaos. Along with the first appearance of the \\"Troubles\\", some number of humans were born with or acquired supernatural abilities. These mutants called \\"Traces\\" are the only ones who can fight off the Troubles. The Traces are also considered freaks and generally shunned by the community because some of them misused the powers for their own interest. The plot revolves around two main characters. Sah Gang- kwon, a high school student born as a \\"Trace\\" who attempts to hide his ability. The other is Kim Yun-Seong, who acquired his \\"Trace\\" abilities during his early 30s. Soon after the acquisition, his wife and daughter were taken away from him for experimental purposes. ; Things you need to let go This arc shares about Ghang Gwon and Tae Eun's story. Ghang Gwon was taken in by Tae Eun's family as a child and hides the fact that he is a 'trace'. He doesn't sleep at night but instead, goes out hunting 'troubles' to protect Tae Eun and her father, which he regards as his family. An unexpected turn of events revealed his identity in school and Ghang Gwon was reported as a trace, being forced to leave them temporarily. It made him realise that it was not possible for him to live as a mere human being with his ability. ; Beggar This arc revolves around the middle aged man, Kim Yun Seong. All he wanted was a peaceful life with his family, away from Traces and Troubles. When he realized he acquired his \\"trace\\" abilities, he tried to hide it but was discovered by the government and his family was taken away. He joins up with a group of other Traces to help him get into the facility where he believes his family is held. ; Rose This arc revolved to the story of Morrienoah Jin, a child which his ability is shot things with his fingers. He was being an assassin and worked with Morie. One day, a girl(Jang-mi) stood outside his house, made a dealt with Morrienoah Jin to protect her. When the deadline almost comes, Jin was fritter her away because scared about love. After realize he couldn't kept it, he became to love Jang-mi. ; Rebellion The arc kicks off with the assembly of various trace factions formed over by both Kim Yun Seong and Pierrot featuring old and new faces onto the crew of traces called the beggar group after Seong went to see a mysterious Trace to augment his abilities. They soon begin to attack a slew of experimental laboratories stationed all around Korea nabbing their top scientists while battling the ongoing inhibition efforts of various other trace factions sent against them such as the mysterious government sponsored Trace group; Hanjo. ; The Last Day Pt.1 ; The Last Day Pt.2 ; Outro & Afterwards Main characters ; Sa Ghang Gwon Sa Ghang Gwon is a Trace with the ability to manipulate ice. His powers had been with him since his birth, and because he could not control them, Ghang Gwon accidentally attacked his own parents. With no cure or solution to Traces, his parents abandoned him on a street next to an old beggar woman Trace who could conjure fire. He wandered around for an indeterminable amount of time, living his life as a scavenger and losing his emotions. He engaged in battle with his first Trouble, but after realizing he could not defeat it, he encased himself in ice until it disappeared. He passed out in a park, where he was found by Han Tae Eun. She took him home and asked her father if she could keep him. Afterward Tae Eun called Ghang Gwon her possession. Her family, consisting of only her and her father, adopted him, but Ghang Gwon, fearing that they would abandon him like his parents, hid from them his identity as a Trace. Over the years, he continued to battle Troubles, honing his skills. Whenever he is injured, though, he lets Tae Eun believe that he was bullied by his classmates. When a Trouble attacks his class, Ghang Gwon attempts to come to the rescue, but Tae Eun stops him, knowing that if he fights the Trouble, his identity as a Trace will be revealed. She begs him not to get involved, but Ghang Gwon engages the Trouble and defeats it. Afterwards, he is taken by the government for three months, and then enrolled in a Trace school. His prime objective is to leave the Trace school and return to his family as soon as possible, and he believes that capturing the Beggar Team will grant him freedom. Ghang Gwon is very quiet and almost antisocial. He hates that he is a Trace, shamefully hiding it from Han Tae Eun and her father; often, he mutters to himself that he is not a Trace. But he also specifically uses his powers to battle and destroy Troubles, so that his family can be safe. He is easily bullied and also submits to their beatings without complaint (for the sake of Han Tae Eun's safety), which only angers her. He has no facial expressions and seems to enjoy antagonizing her, calling her \\"battle addict\\" or \\"fighting chicken.\\" He is extremely protective of her and her father, as his family. He seems to find Tae Eun especially precious. It is hinted that he likes her as more than a sister; while in the Trace academy, he repeatedly writes letters to her, ending each with the words \\"I miss you.\\" ; Han Tae Eun Hot-blooded and fiery, Han Tae Eun is well known in her school as a formidable fighter, more inclined to her fists than talking things through. She yells often, especially at Sa Ghang Gwon when he aggravates her. As a child her mother was killed by a rouge Trace in a park, and Tae Eun repeatedly visited the same spot her mother died, until she found a barely conscious Sa Ghang Gwon lying there. She took him home and adopted him as her possession. At some point in time, she discovered he was a Trace and labored to protect his identity, unbeknownst to him. When Sa Ghang Gwon is taken away by the government, Han Tae Eun declares that she will become a Trace and be like him. She repeatedly battles Troubles at the expense of her own life, but then she awakens as a Trace. Her arms turn a sparkling red and shoot sparks, granting her inhuman strength and abilities. It seems that she needs to repeatedly punch hard objects like the ground to activate one of her arms, but if she strikes her fists together, the other arm will ignite. Tae Eun is easily angered and irritable but also fiercely protective of Sa Ghang Gwon. She protects him specifically to prevent him from fighting back, so that he won't accidentally reveal his identity as a Trace. She seemed to resent that he was a Trace while she wasn't and accused Ghang Gwon of the same feelings, since he tried to hide his true identity from her. She's stubborn, believing that if she fought Troubles, she would become a Trace. After she becomes one, she goes about fighting Troubles, in the same way Ghang Gwon did (dressed with a face mask). Tae Eun seems to hold romantic feelings for Ghang Gwon, getting jealous when he carries Se Yeon and tells Tae Eun to run while escaping a Trouble. ; Kim Yoon Seong Kim Yoon Seong was a man with a perfect life: a job, a loving wife, and a daughter. All this changes when one day he turns into a trace. Being a law-abiding citizen, he decides to legally register as a trace, rather than hide his identity. After that he is separated from his family who are taken to a trace facility where the family of the traces are taken. When he is not able to contact them he goes to the facility to see his family where he is stopped by a group of trace guards and chased where he meets Jeong Hee Sub who is also a trace trying to get into the facility. They join and form a team and recruit other members. They succeed in entering the facility where Kim Yun Seong finds the family of the traces who are brought there are used for experimental purposes and killed. ; Morrienoah Jin As a child, Jin was an emotionless trace who had ideals that 'The good should live, the bad should die', killing people who he deemed as bad. After coincidentally saving Morrie, he was raised by him to become a killer. He easily obtained the top title of Morrienoah that every killer wanted, being described as the perfect killer as he had no emotional weaknesses. This changed when he received a bizarre contract to protect a girl named Jang Mi (Rose) for a month from a killer. Rose gradually changed his life and Jin fell in love with her as the deadline drew closer. Jin managed to kill the killer after her life, yet, she committed suicide in front of him shortly after. Turns out that Rose was one of his victim's child and swore revenge by giving him love and make him lose it. Despite all that, she truly did love Jin. Jin was recruited into the 'Pierrot team' to infiltrate the facility much later in life.

It connected Schomberg to the Metropolitan Line of the Toronto and York Radial Railway (T&YRR;) tram service running along Yonge Street, and from there into the Toronto city proper. The service ran for 25 years between 1902 and 1927; the rails were pulled up shortly thereafter. In 1902, the Schomberg and Aurora Railway was acquired by the Metropolitan Street Railway which in turn was acquired by the Toronto and York Radial Railway in 1904. History Map of the S&A; circa 1915. See the small S&A; and the pale yellow patch near the center of the image. The S&AR; started at the request of a Schomberg businessman who wanted to open the local produce markets to day-trippers from Toronto. The T&YRR; had greatly increased visitors to similar markets in Newmarket and they were hoping to do the same for Schomberg. The company was chartered in 1896, and construction started out from the Bond Lake area south of Aurora in July 1899. The line was completed and opened for traffic in August 1902, an oddity that used steam trains to connect to the much smaller electrified trams, a connection made at Aurora. There were four stations in total, Aurora on the west side of Yonge Street north of Bond Crescent, Eversley Station on Dufferin Street, Kettleby Station at the corner of Kettleby Road and Weston Road, and Schomberg Station in the middle of Main Street in Schomberg. (The S&A; \\"Aurora\\" station was actually in Oak Ridges, a community within today's Town of Richmond Hill to the south of Aurora.) The S&A; connected with the T&YRR;'s Metropolitan line at Aurora. There were also numerous street-side whistle stops along the route, numbers 158 through 171. Because the railway operated on a small budget, it purchased extant buildings for its stations instead of constructing new ones. There were four spurs, one to Mary Lake to serve a private line to the summer estates of Henry Pellatt and the Eatons (Eaton Hall), two smaller ones near Pottageville serving the Lloyd and Armstrong farms, and a small wye at Brillinger farm. Initially, the S&A; used two old steam locomotives and one or two passenger cars. It ran two round trips daily, three on Wednesday market days. The S&AR; operated independently for only two years before it was absorbed into the T&YRR; family, part of William Mackenzie's railway empire. In 1916 the line was electrified and connected to the Metropolitan line at Yonge Street, allowing full interchange of cars. Some S&A; cars operated through to Toronto via the Metropolitan line, but most made connections at Bond Lake. In addition to passenger traffic, the line generated about 300 carloads of freight per year. The line was never very busy, and the T&YRR; scaled back operations. Between 1923 and 1926, expenses to run the line were about $26,000 per year, but revenues for that period declined from $31,325 to $17,997. The S&AR; was closed on June 20, 1927. Attempts by residents in Schomberg to reopen the line failed, and the rails were removed the next year. Remains of the line Portions of the former right-of-way remain easily visible on aerial photos today, notably the portions closer to Schomberg. The final few hundred yards were incorporated into Dr. Kay Road in Schomberg, running between Main Street and the much newer Highway 27 to the east. Other portions have been incorporated in the nearby 19th Sideroad, Lloyd's Lane and Brule Trail, but development to the east of Highway 400 makes it more difficult to follow. The Aurora station was converted into a restaurant before being demolished in the 1960s. The only S&AR; building still in existence is a house in Schomberg that was once the terminus of the line.

Before the 1940s the game of ice hockey was not cultivated in Russia, instead the more popular form of hockey was bandy. Following the dissolution of the USSR, the league was temporarily renamed the CIS Championship in 1992. This organization was the direct predecessor of the International Hockey League (), and subsequent Russian Superleague (RSL) and current Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).  Teams  The first cities to enter teams in the Soviet League were Arkhangelsk, Kaunas, Leningrad, Moscow, Riga, Sverdlovsk, Tallinn and Uzhhorod. The teams were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company (aircraft industry, food workers, tractor industry) or organization (KGB, Red Army, Soviet Air Force) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours social sports society hockey team for their workers.

Life and work He was born into a family of merchants and artisans. In 1603, he entered the workshop of El Greco, and remained there until 1606. He initially imitated his teacher's style to the extent that many of his works have been attributed to him and vice versa. After El Greco's son, Jorge Manuel Theotocópuli, Tristán is considered to be his principle follower. He then spent seven years in Italy, returning home around 1613. He would work exclusively in Toledo for the rest of his life. His post-Italian work showed the influence of the Caravaggisti and the general aesthetic approach of the Counter-reformation. Apart from a few realistic portraits, his work is religious in focus. Although his figures show the distortions typical of his master, he introduced elements from daily life, rendered in a naturalistic style that offsets their lack of realism. His most important works may be a set of paintings made for the main altarpiece at the church of Saint Benedict of Nursia in Yepes, from approximately 1616, which includes six scenes from the life of Jesus and eight half-figures of various saints. During the Spanish Civil War, the altar was largely destroyed, but the torn canvases were repaired at the Museo del Prado and all but two were returned to the church in 1942. Other works include \\"Saint Louis Distributing Alms\\", currently in the Louvre, and \\"The Round of Bread and Eggs\\" at the Museum of Santa Cruz. One of his best-known students was the still-life painter, Pedro de Camprobín.

The sounds need not be a language the participant understands, nor even a real language; human speech sounds are sufficient to produce this effect. This theory is also sometimes known as the Irrelevant sound effect(ISE). The theory covers speech as well as music or other background sounds. There have been many studies on this theory and it has been consistently proven that unrelated or irrelevant background sounds inhibits one's ability to perform well at serial recall (Perham & Vizard 2010) Interference hypothesis It is possible that the visual stimuli (the list of items) is held in working memory as a phonological code. The phonological loop is composed of the articulatory rehearsal loop and the phonological store. If that is the case, the irrelevant speech could interfere with the articulatory rehearsal process, degrading the information in the phonological store. This would result in degraded performance on trials where irrelevant speech is presented. However, the effect should be greater for words rehearsed longer (i.e. presented earlier in the series) since they are rehearsed more often, hence having more opportunity for degradation.

It was built in 1911 and 1912, completely reconstructed between 1962 and 1964 and partially renovated in 2002. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home of Borussia Neunkirchen. The stadium is also used by the American football team Saarland Hurricanes from Saarbrücken. The stadium has a capacity of 23,400 spectators. History =Construction of Borussia-Sportplatz= Borussia Neunkirchen obtained the grounds of Ellenfeld on a leasehold basis from the brewery Neunkircher Schloss-Brauerei. In the leasehold the first right of acquisition was also granted to the club.Historischer Verein Stadt Neunkirchen, August 2017 Construction of the Borussia-Sportplatz began in October 1911 and was finished in July 1912. Total construction costs were around 23,200 DM. However, the openingsmatch was on 7 April 1912, when Borussia Neunkirchen played the football squad of the 6. Königlich-Sächsischen Infanterieregiments Nr. 105 from Strasbourg. Borussia Neunkirchen won this match with 6-3. =Early expansion= Due to the club’s successes, the stadium’s capacity became too limited. When MTK Budapest played a friendly match at the Borussia-Sportplatz, the stadium couldn’t accommodate all the spectators. Plans for expansion were made and in 1921 a new wooden stand was built, which was operated by a third party. Other stands were also expanded, which increased the stadium’s capacity to 12,000 spectators. In 1928 a fire demolished the wooden stand and Borussia Neunkirchen decided to build a concrete stand in its place. The construction costs exceeded the budget, which led to financial troubles at the club. A local company took over the debts. =Plans for the Ellenfeldstadion= In 1948 Borussia Neunkirchen purchased the grounds of Ellenfeld and presented plans for a new Ellenfeldstadion. In 1952 the club and architect Felix Schaan present new plans to build a stadium, that can hold up to 25,000 to 30,000 spectators. However, at the same time the Ludwigsparkstadion in Saarbrücken is build and Saarland’s government is politically and financially engaged in the construction of the Ludwigsparkstadion. Borussia Neunkirchen is forced to set aside the plans for their new stadium. The club and architect prepare new plans for a multi-purpose stadium and in 1960 a sports hall is opened. Saarland agrees to financially contribute to the building of a new Ellenfeldstadion, which can hold up to 30,000 spectators. The estimated construction costs are 1.8 million DM, to which Saarland contributes 50%. During the construction of the stadium, Borussia Neunkirchen promotes to the 1. Bundesliga and the opening match against Borussia Dortmund attracts 25,000 spectators. An average of 18,755 spectators visits the matches at the Ellenfeldstadion. =Stadium's decline= Three years after their promotion, Borussia Neunkirchen was regulated to the 2nd tier of German football. The club plays in the top-level of the 2nd tier, but never achieves promotion. In 1971 a record attendance of 31,000 spectators visits the match Borussia Neunkirchen vs 1. FC Nürnberg. In the 1980s, several big companies in Neunkirchen face bankruptcy, which cause a decline in sponsorship fees. Borussia Neunkirchen also relegates towards the amateurs and faces bankruptcy in 1990. In 1990, Neunkirchen’s city council decides to purchase the stadium from Borussia Neunkirchen and the club is saved from bankruptcy. The stadium's maintenance is limited, though a small renovation in 2002 is carried out at the costs of 500,000 euro. In 2003 Borussia Neunkirchen draws Bayern München for the DFB-Pokal and 23,400 spectators visit the match in the Ellenfeldstadion. In 2007 the derby against 1. FC Saarbrücken attracts 10,000 spectators. In 2011 and 2012 several plans are made for a complete reconstruction of the Ellenfeldstadion, but were never carried out.total reconstruction Ellenfeldstadion Since a few years, due to safety regulations, several stands are closed down for the public.

A slew of such vehicles were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s; most only reached limited production and market penetration as used Western vehicles often proved cheaper. In Southeast Asia, these are often referred to as \\"AUVs\\", or \\"Asian Utility Vehicles\\". They have also been called \\"Basic Transportation Vehicles\\" (BTV). The Institute for Affordable Transportation (IAT) currently holds annual competitions aimed at developing new such vehicles. 1960s Farmobil Greek financier Peter Kondorgouris began producing a small utility vehicle called the Farmobil, based on a 1957 design by Wilfried Fahr of Switzerland. Using BMW engines, about 1000 were built between 1962 and 1966. The Farco company was taken over by Chrysler in the mid-sixties and they took over distribution in many markets. 1970s Baby Brousse Basic utility vehicles were developed by Ford and GM specifically for sale in East Asia, with the intent of opening new markets there and in Africa. Volkswagen also developed a vehicle, the EA489 Basistransporter which was built from 1975 until 1979. Dutch DAF developed a stillborn competitor for this field, the 1972 BATU (Basic Automotive Transport Unit) General Motors' BTV effort was sold under a variety of different names and used the Vauxhall Viva's underpinnings and 1256 cc inline-four engine. It was built in Ecuador, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Portugal, and the Philippines. It was marketed as the GM Amigo, Andino (Ecuador), Mitaí (Paraguay), and Bedford Harimau (\\"Tiger\\", Malaysia). The 1977 Toyota Tamaraw Citroën's FAF and Baby Brousse also fit this mold, with the acronym FAF standing for \\"Easy to Finance, Easy to Build.\\" The FAF and related versions entered production in ten countries, most of them in the developing world. Over 30,000 were built from 1973 until the 1980s. Nissan called their Datsun 1200 AX a BTV, it was introduced in June 1977 and received their 1171 cc A12 engine. Nissan/Datsun built it in Thailand (Siam Motors) and in Portugal. In Portugal it was called the Datsun Sado. The most successful BUV is arguably the Toyota Kijang, which entered production in Indonesia and the Philippines (as the Tamaraw) in 1977 and 1976. The Kijang/Tamaraw has, over five generations, morphed into a fairly luxurious Compact MPV called the Toyota Innova. It even spawned rivals in the Philippine market. Those include the Ford Fiera (later known as Nissan Bida), Isuzu KC 20, Mitsubishi Cimarron, and the GM Harabas (made by General Motors). One thing that unites the various Basic Utility Vehicles of this era is that they used almost exclusively flat, welded sheetmetal, giving them a certain uniformity of appearance. Later yet, the independent Africar project again tried to target developing markets, in particular, Africa. Only six were built from 1986 until the company folded in 1988. BUV Design Competition The 2006 Basic Utility Vehicle competition A three-wheeled BUV The Institute for Affordable Transportation (IAT) is the promoter of this type of vehicle and the main sponsor. IAT runs the annual BUV Design Competition where engineering students bring their vehicles for judging and performance evaluation (including cost) and contribute to IAT’s research and development efforts. The competition harnesses the creative energy of college students from across the United States in an effort to develop a simple, low-cost utility vehicle that can benefit low-income people in rural areas of developing countries. Student teams design and build these vehicles to compete in a series of tests and events to determine the best design. Each team also plans an oral report aimed towards the judges and spectators. In the reports, students discuss the planning, building, and testing processes that each BUV went through prior to the competition. Because the BUV must account for a lack of infrastructure, the vehicles must pass a variety of tests during the competition including an obstacle course, mud pit, mogul field, and endurance track. Many of the students work on the BUV as a senior capstone project at the end of their engineering degree. BUVs are designed around these specifications: *Cost: less than $1000 *Payload: 1000 lbs *Maximum speed: 20 mph *Weight: 500 lbs. *Engine: 10 or 11 HP, gasoline or Diesel *Materials: pickup-truck axle, steel tubing and angle etc. *Maximize: Number of unassembled kits that fit in 20' ocean container *Minimize: Total cost of ownership, custom designed parts, part number count *Excluded Doors, body panels, glass, trim, gauges, hydraulics, radiator, heater See also Institute for Affordable Transportation * Student Design Competition * Formula SAE References External linksBUV Design Competition official website Off-road vehicles Sustainable transport ","title":"Basic utility vehicle"},{"id":"19677307","text":"\\"The Arrest of Lieutenant Golightly\\" is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. It was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on November 23 1886, in book form in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888, and in subsequent editions of that collection. The story, published when Kipling was not quite 21 years old, is a well-crafted piece of writing about an essentially schoolboy version of schadenfreude - sheer pleasure, in this case, at seeing someone 'get his comeuppance' - with an element of slapstick. Lieutenant Golightly is a young officer in the British Army in India who prides himself on \\"looking like 'an Officer and a Gentleman'\\". According to John McGivering, in the Notes to this story on the Kipling Society's website, Golightly is certainly an officer, but not at all certainly a gentleman. It is clear that he takes too much care over his appearance, and dresses rather too flashily, wearing, as he is, a \\"delicate olive-green suit\\" with a blue tie and a sola topee. As he hastens back from leave (having left all his money apart from loose change behind him), he is beset by misfortune: monsoon rains make him muddy and sweaty; his helmet dissolves in the rain; the dyes of its lining (purple) and his suit (green) run. He falls from his horse, which becomes so lame that he has to walk, whereon he throws away his tie, which has also run, and his (detachable) collar. He arrives at a railway station, buys a drink - and finds that he only has 6 Indian anna left. On talking to the Station Master, he is taken for a deserter, one Private Binkle, and after some temporising is arrested and carried bodily off by four native policeman. They hand him over to a detachment of the British Army, who admire his fluency in bad language, but don't believe his insistence that he is an officer. Golightly is finally saved by a Major in his own Regiment, who recognises him and has him released - then, of course, relating the story to the army. Kipling says that he may now publish the story as Golightly has \\"gone Home\\". :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

From the left to the right: Ruard Manor, Church of the Assumption of Mary, Worker's Barracks The Bucellini–Ruard Manor, commonly referred to as the Ruard Manor (), is a 16th-century manor house located in the Sava neighbourhood of the town of Jesenice in northwestern Slovenia, at the street address of 45 France Prešeren Street (). It is one of four so-called \\"ironworks castles\\" built in the area during the 16th and early 17th centuries by the owners of iron-mining and -processing facilities, in what were then the clustered settlements of Plavž, Sava, Murova and Javornik, amalgamated into the town of Jesenice in 1929. The Kos Manor in Murova also survives; the Plavž and Javornik manors were demolished. The Ruard Manor was built in 1538 by the Italian businessman Bernardo Bucellini, who had recently relocated to Sava from Bergamo and whose family would come to dominate the iron mining and processing industry of the entire upper Sava valley. Unlike the Kos manor, Bucelenni chose to locate this residence close to the ironworks themselves. The Bucellinis were very successful for a time, and were ennobled during the 17th century, taking the name \\"von Reichenberg\\" after the German name of their ore mines at Savske Jame. In 1686 the family was elevated to counthoood. The manor gained the second half of its current name in 1766, when Valentin Ruard, a Belgian entrepreneur, bought the entire estate and restored the failing ironworks surrounding it. Leopold Ruard, his son, was mayor of Jesenice under the brief period of French rule. In 1831, the manor was expanded and reconstructed in the Neoclassical style. In the next generation, it passed out of Ruard hands, as Viktor Ruard was unable to obtain capital for the modernization of the family ironworks, and was forced to sell both them and the manor to the KID company in 1871, which converted it into clerks' housing (much like the nearby Workers' Barracks). Since 1954, the manor has served as a museum, and later became the seat of the Upper Sava Museum.Upper Sava Museum web site It hosts several permanent exhibits: *Historical museum of the iron and steel industry in the Jesenice region, featuring tools, artifacts and motorized maquettes of industrial facilities *Paleontological collection of the Palaeozoic flora and fauna of the western Karawanks *Mineral collectionStara Sava tourist guide, from the Jesenice municipal web site  References  Houses completed in 1538 Manors in Slovenia History museums in Slovenia Jesenice, Jesenice 1538 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Ruard Manor"},{"id":"19677610","text":"The 2002 United States Senate election in Alabama was held on November 5, 2002.

His chief role was to ferry gunpowder from the powder magazine in the ship's hold to the artillery pieces, either in bulk or as cartridges, to minimize the risk of fires and explosions. The function was usually fulfilled by boy seamen of 12 to 14 years of age. Powder monkeys were usually boys or young teens, selected for the job for their speed and height: they were short and could move more easily in the limited space between decks and would also be hidden behind the ship's gunwale, keeping them from being shot by enemy ships' sharpshooters. These powder monkeys held no official naval rank on the ships that they sailed on. Some women and older men also worked as powder monkeys. Many of the powder monkeys in the British Navy that ended up on ships were part of the poor working class. The Marine Society that promoted youths to join the British Royal Navy recruited them by providing clothes, bedding, and a rudimentary education. In the mid-1790s it is estimated that the Marine Society was sending five or six hundred boys a year to the fleet although not all of these boys became powder monkeys. Of the boys who were recruited by the Marine Society; most had no other option than to join the navy as their parents could not afford to raise them. However a significant amount had familial ties to the sea. This group had cousins, fathers, and even grandfathers were sailors thus making them want to continue family traditions and exploit their sense of adventure. The United States did not have an established navy until after its independence in 1776 and even then it was loosely organized. The United States Navy started using powder monkeys in the late 1700s after modeling its structure off of the Royal Navy. The nations fought against each other in the War of 1812. During which time both sides utilized the special physical gifts that powder monkeys offered on board of their warships. After the War of 1812 boys under the age of twelve were outlawed by the U.S. Navy to serve on ships. However, boys above that age were still used as powder monkeys until the Spanish–American War at the end of the nineteenth century. The Royal Navy first began using the term \\"powder monkey\\" in the 17th century. The term was later used, and continues to be used in some countries, to signify a skilled technician or engineer who engages in blasting work, such as in the mining or demolition industries. In such industries, a \\"powder monkey\\" is also sometimes referred to as a \\"blaster\\".

Slip forming is used for tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways. Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place \\"flawless\\" (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements. Slip forming relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete, and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet quick-setting enough to emerge from the form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to \\"slip\\" by the concrete without disturbing it, but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery. Slipforming of a 118m-tall grain silo in Zürich in 2015 Continuous slip formed gravity-based structure supports under construction in a Norwegian fjord. The visible jib cranes would each be delivering buckets of concrete to the support cylinders during the continuous pour of concrete creating seamless walls. In vertical slip forming the concrete form may be surrounded by a platform on which workers stand, placing steel reinforcing rods into the concrete and ensuring a smooth pour. Together, the concrete form and working platform are raised by means of hydraulic jacks.Nawy, Concrete Construction Engineering Handbook, 2008, p. 10—34. Generally, the slipform rises at a rate which permits the concrete to harden by the time it emerges from the bottom of the form. In horizontal slip forming for pavement and traffic separation walls concrete is laid down, vibrated, worked, and settled in place while the form itself slowly moves ahead. This method was initially devised and utilized in Interstate Highway construction initiated by the Eisenhower administration during the 1950s. Slipform Monobox System  History  The slip forming technique was in use by the early 20th century for building silos and grain elevators. James MacDonald, of MacDonald Engineering of Chicago was the pioneer in utilizing slip form concrete for construction. His concept of placing circular bins in clusters was patented, with photographs and illustrations, contained in a 1907 book, “The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”. “The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”. By Milo Smith Ketchum, The Engineering News Publishing Co.,1907, page 294. In 1910, MacDonald published a paper “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins,” James MacDonald - “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins.” Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Convention Held at N.Y., N.Y. Volume 7, By National Association of Cement Users (U.S.). December 12–20, 1910. page 554. describing the use of molds for moving forms, using jacks and concrete to form a continuous structure without joints or seams. This paper details the concept and procedure for creating slip form concrete structures. On May 24, 1917, a patent was issued to James MacDonald of Chicago, \\"for a device to move and elevate a concrete form in a vertical plane\\".Official gazette of the United States Patent Office, By United States. Patent Office Volume CCXXXVII. April 24, 1917, page 943. =Silos= James MacDonald’s bin and silo design was utilized around the world into the late 1970s by MacDonald Engineering. In the 1947-1950 period, MacDonald Engineering constructed over 40 concrete towers using the slip-form method for AT&T; Long Lines The Concrete Microwave Towers of AT&T;'s First Transcontinental Radio Route> up to tall for microwave relay stations across the United States. AT&T; Long Lines relay tower in Indiana constructed with the slip-form method.

The Swedish company Bygging developed in 1944 the first hydraulic hijacks to lift the forms, which got patented.

May 1, 1971. One of Its first uses in high-rise buildings in the United States was on the shear wall supported apartment building at Turk & Eddy Streets in San Francisco, CA, in 1962, built by the San Francisco office of Macdonald Engineering. The first notable use of the method in a residential/retail business was the Skylon Tower in Niagara Falls, Ontario, which was completed in 1965. Another unusual structure was the tapered buttress structures for the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1969. Another shear wall supported structure was the Casa Del Mar Condominium on Key Biscayne, Miami, FL in 1970. From the 1950s, the vertical technique was adapted to mining head frames, ventilation structures, below grade shaft lining, and coal train loading silos; theme and communication tower construction; high rise office building cores; shear wall supported apartment buildings; tapered stacks and hydro intake structures, etc. It is used for structures which would otherwise not be possible, such as the separate legs of the Troll A deep sea oil drilling platform which stands on the sea floor in water about deep, has an overall height of weighs , and has the distinction of being the tallest structure ever moved (towed) by mankind. In addition to the typical silos and shear walls and cores in buildings, the system is used for lining underground shafts and surge tanks in hydroelectric generating facilities. The technique was utilized to build the Inco Superstack in Sudbury, Ontario, and the CN Tower in Toronto. In 2010, the technique was used to build the core of the supertall Shard London Bridge tower in London, England.

Definition Ultimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their personality, and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors. Overview The ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication \\"The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice\\". As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of Gordon Allport's work in attribution theory. The ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly genetically determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) \\"exceptional case\\", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes. In general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and stereotypes toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other races, religions, cultures, or even social class as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted. Explaining away positive behavior of outgroup members Explaining away positive behavior in outgroup members. The attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived locus of control of act (internal vs external). =Exceptional case= The \\"exceptional case\\" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the \\"good\\" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as \\"bad\\". =Luck or special advantage= The \\"luck or special advantage\\" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. \\"Special advantage\\" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance. =Highly motivated= The \\"highly motivated\\" explanation is created at the intersection of high- perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member. Similar to the \\"exceptional case\\" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them. =Situational= The \\"situational\\" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence. Evidence The ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members. In a 2x2 between-group design, Hindu or Muslim participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups. Prior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that White participants viewed Black individuals as more violent than White individuals in an \\"ambiguous shove\\" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person. In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm- doer is White (ingroup). Morris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant. In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect. Together, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation. Supporting this general statement, a meta- analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990. The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error: *more internal attribution for positive acts, and less internal attribution for negative acts, by ingroup than outgroup members; *more attribution of outgroup members' failures to lack of ability, and more explaining away of outgroup members' successes; *a preference for ingroup- serving versus outgroup-serving attributions for group differences.

It is a walled bulwark of the modern era, highlighted by a Renaissance-era window in the northern tower of the castle. It has been listed as a National monument since 1911. History The walls of the citadel on the hilltop of Outeiro de Santa Vitória Owing the regions occupation by successive tribes of Celts, Romans and Muslims, it is likely that the territory of Campo Maior has been settled during the pre-historic epochs. The land of Campo Maior was definitively conquered from the Moors by the forces of Kingdom of León in 1230. The first foral (charter) was issued by the Bishop of Badajoz thirty years after this event. Eventually, the castle was conquered by the Portuguese in 1295-1296, and integrated into the national territory in 1297, under the Treaty of Alcanizes. In order to maintain the peace between Spain and Portugal, King Denis ordered the reconstruction of the fortress in 1310, oriented toward his Iberian rivals. These fortifications were extended and rehabilitation during the 15th and 16th century completed, during the reigns of his successors John and Manuel, designed by Duarte d'Armas. =Kingdom= Around 1640, following the Portuguese Restoration War, King John IV established a Counsel of War that formed their territory into military provinces: Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alentejo and Algarve. Therefore, following the decision of John IV, work began in 1645 under the supervision of João Cosmander to reconstruct the bulwarks. Between 17th and 18th century the fortification was adapted for the time, obtaining the bulwarks and secondary walls, in addition to the installation of permanent military storehouses, stables and barracks. After 1644, many of the reconstruction of the fortress was handled by Nicolau de Langres. A document, dated 14 May 1647, identified Langres as the military engineer of the project, while requesting material for the construction of military square, in addition to the arms necessary to protect the castle and its surrounding territory. In 1662, Luís Serrão Pimentel continued work on the walls. On 22 May 1680, D. Peter, acting as regent, ordered Mateus do Couto, D. Diogo Pardo and António Rodrigues to Campo Maior, in order to verify the work being done on the citadel, under the plans of Luís Serrão Pimentel. During the Spanish War of Succession, in 1712, the square was besieged by Spanish forces and defended in the main square. In 1732, an explosion in powder magazine (caused by thunderstorms) resulted in the destruction of the castle and surrounding walls of the old town around 3:00 in the morning; the space was totally levelled, and many of the homes around the walls were destroyed. At the time of the explosion, the magazine held of gunpowder and 5000 munitions; the violent explosion resulted in a fire that, in addition to the direct deaths, consumed almost half of the town's homes. The powder magazine was reconstructed by order of John V of Portugal in 1735, under the meticulous care of Manuel de Azevedo Fortes. On 2 July 1736, Diogo Lopes de Sepúlveda was awarded the commission to the post of Sergeant-Major, as part of his efforts in reconstructing the square after these events. But, in 1762, Spanish forces, once again, invaded the territory (during the Seven Years' War and meeting the Portuguese in Campo Maior. =Peninsular wars= During the Peninsular War, during the Battle of the Oranges (), Portuguese forces capitulated in 1810. After a small victory, these forces recapitulated in 1811. =20th century= On 18 March 1911, the structure was classified as a national monument by Decree. In the first half of the 1940s, the Direcção-Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) began works to restore the group of structures. A second phase of construction was begun in the 1960s, and extended into the 1970s, marked by interventions in the castle walls and the Chapel of Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos. A third phase of reconstruction began in the latter part of the 1980s, when the castle and walls repaired, just before the castle became the responsibility of the Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico (IPPAR), on 1 June 1992, Decree-law 106F/92. Owing to bad weather in 2010, the castle walls were partially destroyed. Architecture The northern tower and walls of the citadel Detail of the Renaissance window of the northern tower The castle is located in an urban context, is walls encircling the area known as Outeiro de Santa Vitória, the top of which is the castle, in altitude, transformed into a citadel with bulwark fortifications. It is positioned, from the Spanish frontier and from Badajoz and Elvas (areas that are visible from its towers), the fortress is encircled in the north, northeast, east and southeast by modern buildings and the town is similarly encircled by agricultural lands. A heavily walled fortification, formed of a ten-sided polygon curtain of walls, with some missing facades. The walls, from the south, in a clockwise direction: the bulwark of Boa Vista, middle bulwark of São Sebastião, the gates of the Vila (town), the middle bulwark of Lisbon, middle bulwark of Curral dos Coelhos, bulwark of Santa Cruz, bulwark of Cavaleiro (also referred to as the São João bulwark), the middle bulwark of Príncipe, bulwark of Fonte do Concelho, middle bulwark of São Francisco and middle bulwark of Santa Rosa. The fortification also includes a gap and counterescarp in part of its extension, namely in the south and northeastern parts, as well as four turrets. A number of military edifices have occupied the spaces within the castle, collectively maintaining several of the existing buildings in some form of use (the warehouses, barracks, stables and living spaces). The castle retains two of its six original towers, an irregular rectangular space with walls forming a trapezoid space, with battlements and adarve permitting access to the remaining towers. The towers have battlements and walls, terminating in a frusto-pyramidal domes, rounded at the top. Each tower has a vaulted ceiling at the adarve, with the northern tower exemplified by a decorated Renaissance window. To the south, are the walls that circle the old village of Campo Maior, a rough design in the form of an elipse, with seven towers, six rectangular and one, in the northeast, octagonal, forming the main entrance to the complex. The walls are lower, in order to support barbettes and canon emplacements. One of the towers, in the southwest, along one of the false gates has battlements. To the southeast is, also, the Chapel of Senhor dos Aflitos. The castle grounds are semi-/permanently occupied by cultural (museum historical and military architecture of Campo Maior); residential (part of the bulwarks occupied by residences, in the middle bulwark of São Sebastião there are gypsy communities); and equipment (part of the bulwarks occupied by storerooms and facilities for breeding of animals, as well as waste disposal).

Because of his torture by the Communist Chinese and death in prison in 1952, he is considered a martyr, and the cause for his canonization has begun, granting him the religious title of Servant of God. Life =Early life and priesthood= Ford was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Austin Brendan Ford and Elizabeth Rellihan Ford. He attended Cathedral College in Manhattan. While studying there, he felt a call to respond to the vision of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, just founded in 1911 by the Catholic bishops of the United States for overseas service. Upon completion of his high school studies, he was accepted by the Society. When Ford reported to the Maryknoll seminary in Ossining, New York, on 14 September 1912, he became the first student of the fledgling Maryknoll Society. He was the first person to matriculate in this institution. He was ordained on December 5, 1917, and became one of the first four American Catholic priests to arrive in China in 1918. Francis Xavier Ford's cousin, Maryknoll sister Ita Ford, was one of four Catholic churchwomen who were tortured, raped and murdered in El Salvador by members of a military death squad on December 2, 1980. She had previously worked with the poor and war refugees as a Maryknoll Sister missionary in Bolivia and Chile. =Missionary service= Fr Ford in China. In 1918 Ford began to serve in the Province of Canton (Guangdong), in southern China, and in 1921 opened the first Maryknoll mission in China. He was named Prefect Apostolic of a new mission in Kaying (Meizhou) in northern Guangdong in 1925. The Prefecture was raised to the status of a Vicariate Apostolic in 1935, with Ford named as Vicar Apostolic, for which he was appointed the titular bishop of Etenna. He was consecrated a bishop by Bishop James Anthony Walsh, M.M., the Superior General of the Maryknoll Society on September 21, 1935. During twenty years of serving in Kaying, Ford increased his flock from 9,000 to 20,000, and built schools, hostels and churches. He was chairman of the Chinese Catholic Welfare Conference for Southern China and played an important role in establishing the first overseas convent for the Maryknoll Sisters. When World War II started, Kaying was surrounded by Japanese troops. Nevertheless, the bishop remained at his post, aiding Chinese guerrillas, helping downed Allied airmen escape, relieving war refugees in distress. Shortly after the war ended, in April 1946, the vicariate was raised by the Holy See to the status of a full diocese, with Ford appointed as its first bishop. =Torture and death= The victory of the forces of the Chinese Communist Party over the Nationalist forces of General Chiang Kai-shek in October 1949 marked a major shift in the fate of the Catholic missions. In December 1950 the Communists placed Bishop Ford and his secretary, Sister Joan Marie Ryan, M.M., under house arrest and charged them with espionage. Though never tried, Ford was taken from his home four months later and publicly paraded, beaten and degraded in some of the cities in which he had done mission work since 1918. His treatment at the hands of the Communists is attested to by Ryan. In one town, a Communist- orchestrated mob beating was so intense that even Ford's Communist guards fled. Though knocked to the ground repeatedly, Ford continued to walk calmly through the crowd until his guards returned. In another town, his neck was bound with a wet rope which almost choked him as it dried and shrank. Another rope was made to trail from under his gown like a tail. To humiliate them both, the Communists forced Ford to undress before Ryan. The last time she saw the bishop alive was in February 1952, just before he died. She reported that his hair had turned completely white and he was so emaciated that a fellow prisoner remarked that he looked \\"like a sack of potatoes\\". Ford died in a prison in Guangzhou on February 21, 1952. He was the first American Roman Catholic bishop and fourth American civilian known to have died in the prisons of the Chinese Communists. Ford's diocese would have been the first Maryknoll territory to be turned over to the native clergy had the Communists not suppressed the local Catholic community. Ford was Maryknoll's first martyr, and the first to be killed at the hands of Chinese Communists. Ford's remains were never found, having been intentionally scattered by the Chinese Communists. At the time of his death, Ford had been a priest for 34 years and a bishop for 16 years. Legacy =Cause for canonization= A cause for the canonization of Ford has been introduced by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. Rev. John Vesey, pastor of St Michael's Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens, is the postulator of the cause. On July 27, 2011, George Weigel wrote an article for the First Things blog, questioning why Ford has not yet been beatified. Wiegel opined that the process has been put on hold because of Roman authorities' concerns about offending the Chinese government. Weigel further stated that \\"[persecuted] Catholics [in China] need the encouragement of a witness like that given by Francis Xavier Ford, whose blood may yet prove to have paved the King's Highway in the Middle Kingdom\\". =Memorials= In 1952, the Maryknoll Fathers in Hong Kong founded a co-educational primary school, and named it Bishop Ford Memorial School (). The school was the first founded by the Maryknoll Fathers in Hong Kong after the Second World War, and is now managed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. * In 1962, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn named one of its high schools after Ford. Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School was accredited by the Regents of the State of New York and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It was located in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn. Due to a 75% decline in enrollment between 2006 and 2014, the school closed at the end of the 2013-2014 academic year.

Norwegian oral traditions were a recurring theme in her works. Her writings often focused on the conflict between the old rural society and modern industrial society.Ragnhild Theodore Jølsen (Store norske leksikon) Biography Ragnhild Jølsen grew up on the historic Ekeberg farm (Ekeberg gård) in Enebakk, Akershus, Norway. This large farm had been in her family since 1634 and remained so until sold in 1903. Ragnhild Jølsen was youngest of nine children, four of whom died early. She moved to Kristiania in 1889 after the family had been hit hard financially. Her father, Holm Jølsen (1833–1906) was an early industrial pioneer and ran Norway's third largest match factory in Ekebergdalen between 1866 and 1886. She completed grammar school in 1891. Ragnhild Jølsen moved back to Enebakk in 1896. She attended a local girls' school (Nissens pikeskole). She later worked as a governess with relatives in Enebakk (1897–1898).Holm Jølsen (Norsk biografisk leksikon) Ekebergdalen (Store norske leksikon) Jølsen was seen as a controversial author in a period of great change, as society transformed itself from the old ways founded on small farming communities into the modern industrial society. Short, chopped- up sentences were typical of her writing style, almost maniacally sounding, as in Biblical form, and her depictions always moved in the intersection between dream and reality. Having received a grant she traveled to Rome in November 1906 and returned to Enebakk in July 1907. There she began an affair with the married Norwegian painter Carl Dørnberger (1864–1940).Carl Dørnberger (Store norske leksikon) Jølsen died in January 1908, allegedly having taken an overdose of sleeping powder. She left for posterity some of Norwegian literature's most forceful depictions of agony-manifesting women. Both in her private life and as a writer she was an outsider, and during most of her short life she lived the life of a bohemian. Add to that her books which shocked her contemporaries with their open depictions of the sex lives and drives of women which caused some reviewers to assert that it had to be a man and not a woman who had written them.Ragnhild (Theodore) Jølsen (Kunstnere i Akershus) For most of the period since her death she has wrongly been portrayed in Norway as a representative of a contemporary class of homestead writers, when in fact only her short story collection Brukshistorier (\\"Factory Tales\\") belongs to this genre. The quite different style which characterizes the bulk of her novels is the meandering motifs of art nouveau and a consistent fatalistic decadence which depicts itself in her intense and admirable authorship. In 1938, a memorial stone was erected with a bronze relief of Ragnhild Jølsen in her home community of Enebakk. In 2008, the municipality organized events to commemorate the centennial of her death. In 1964, Jens Bjørneboe partially depicted her life in the biographical novel Drømmen og Hjulet (\\"The Dream and the Wheel\\").

Initiated in 1160, in the Gothic period, it was enlarged in later centuries in the Manueline style. It was at this site that the Concession of Evoramonte (or the Convention of Evoramonte) on was signed on 26 May 1834, that ended Liberal Wars between the Liberal forces of Queen Maria II of Portugal (under the regency of her father Peter VI of Portugal) and Absolutist armies of Miguel of Portugal.David Birmingham (1993) Since 1910, it has been listed as a Portuguese National monument. History An engraving from 1684, depicting the walled town of Evoramonte, with the tower in the centre The imposing and sobre surfaces of the Castle of Evoramonte Sometime during the 12th century, the region of Évora Monte was conquered from the Moors by the forces of Geraldo Sem Pavor. By 1248, a foral (charter) was issued to the region to provide incentives for settlement, which was reaffirmed in 1271. Around 1306, King Denis ordered the fortification of the town: it was at this time that construction of the castle began, that included the main structure, walls and gates. After the rise of John I of Portugal to the Portuguese throne, the castle and associated lands were given to the constable Nuno Álvares Pereira, who later passed them on to his grandson. A new foral was issued in 1516, by King Manuel. The reconstruction campaign during Manuel's reign, beginning in 1516, resulted in the fortification with four cylindrical towers defining the rectangular perimeter by Francisco de Arruda (completed in 1531). The 1531 Lisbon earthquake destroyed the keep tower of the medieval castle. This structure was then rebuilt by Teodósio I, Duke of Braganza, who, at that time, was master of the region and town. On 26 May 1834, the Concession of Evoramonte was signed between Miguel of Portugal and his brother Peter VI of Portugal, in the name of his daughter Maria da Glória, ending the Liberal Wars. In 1855 the municipality of Evoramonte was extinguished, and its historical administration divided into the neighbouring municipalities of Estremoz, Évora, Arraiolos and Redondo. Between 1930 and 1940, were the first public works to recuperate and renovate the grounds and castle of Evoramonte, under the supervision of the Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN). These actions, which primarily occurred in 1937, included the restoration of the towers and the consolidation of the parapets. Subsequent interventions occurred between 1971-1979, in projects to restore the castle; 1980-1981, in the recuperation of the walls; in 1982, the construction of a sanitation system; followed in 1984 by new restoration projects, culminating in the phase two project in 1986 (which included construction and restoration accompanied with photography of the repairs). Finally in 1987, electricity was installed on the grounds. On 1 June 1992, under Decree 106F/92, this building was transferred into the stewardship of the Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico (IPPAR), in order to rehabilitate and monetize the structure. February 2006, marked the beginning of commemorations to celebrate the castle's 700 years of existence. Architecture The grey granite of the castle peeking from behind the medieval walls of the old city The internal lattice of columns and nerves of the second floor room of the castle The castle crowns the escarpment of Serra d' Ossa, with a commanding view of the local and distant routes, dominating one of the largest squares in Portugal: the municipality of Estremoz. An unusual rectangular building, the castle includes circular towers molded into the structure, providing the castle with an aggressive and powerful characteristics. The building is much larger at the base, and is chamfered to the height of its three storeys, and crowned by large merlons. The three floors are clearly delineated by a ring-shaped cornice at each level, typical of the Manueline style, these cornices are sculpted into a rope, tied at the frontispiece of the structure. At various places along the cylindrical towers are canon emplacements, narrower to the interior, that provide an image that is bellicose and somber. On each storey there is a rectangular window, except on the ground floor exposed to the north, where a portico is fixed. In the large salon on the first floor, the vaulted ovular ceiling is supported by four columns, and raised into a mess of sculpted veins. A similar lattice, though smaller, is used in the remaining floors. By the cylindrical towers in the west, a circular staircase provides access to successive floors.

Plot Description Samantha Madison is still teen ambassador to the United Nations and happily dating the President's son, David. She is also still a semi- celebrity for saving the President's life but does not like the attention she gets for it. As a way to go back to being unnoticed, Sam dyes her naturally red hair to jet black at the beginning of the novel. She and David also start to take a life-drawing class together, though she did not realize that it was about sketching nude models. When David invites her to spend Thanksgiving at Camp David, Sam believes that he wants to have sex. Unsure of whether she's ready for that step in their relationship, she consults her older sister Lucy. Lucy ends up being extremely helpful by giving her sex advice and buying Sam contraceptives. Meanwhile, The President announces his \\"Return to Family\\" campaign, which includes plans to limit access to abortion and birth control. Samantha is faced with a huge dilemma when she accidentally comes off as condemning the \\"Return to Family\\" policy on an MTV special by accidentally implying that she and David have had sex. Sam receives mostly negative backlash for her remarks, but is supported by her friends and family for being honest. When she goes to Camp David during Thanksgiving, she waits in her room all night for David to come, but he never does. Feeling furious, she sneaks into David's room and berates him for his mixed-messages over them having sex. David replies that he didn't mean to imply that anything was going to happen between them. Sam comes to understand that she made up the whole dilemma in her head, but also realizes that she does want to have sex because she loves David. When Sam comes home, she tells Lucy about her and David's first time and discovers that Lucy is actually still a virgin. Lucy explains that she wants to find someone she truly loves before taking that big step. She believes that her tutor Harold is The One for her, like how David is for Sam.

It was founded by the London branch of the Virginia Company, which was competing with the Plymouth branch to settle the Colony of Virginia. Jamestown was the capital of the Colony for 83 years, from 1616 until 1699. At that time, the capital was relocated to Middle Plantation, about distant.

A very wealthy man, Legge never married, and when he died in 1835 he left large sums of money to his domestic staff. Early career Arthur Kaye Legge was born in 1766, the sixth son of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth and his wife Frances-Catherine. Among his siblings were George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, Edward Legge, Bishop of Oxford and Lady Charlotte Feversham, the wife of Lord Feversham. Entering the Navy at a young age, Legge served aboard HMS Prince George with the young Prince William off the Eastern Seaboard of North America. By 1791, Legge was a lieutenant and held an independent command in the Channel Fleet as captain of HMS Shark. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 saw Legge promoted, becoming a post captain in the frigate HMS Niger. In this vessel, Legge served in the fleet under Lord Howe that fought in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 and the ensuing Glorious First of June. As a frigate captain, Legge was not actively engaged in the battle, but did perform numerous scouting missions during the campaign, relayed signals to the fleet during the battle and gave a tow to badly damaged ships in its aftermath. In 1795, Legge took command of HMS Latona and formed part of the squadron that escorted Caroline of Brunswick to Britain before her marriage to Prince George. In 1797 he moved to HMS Cambrian and operated independently off the French Channel coast, sailing from Weymouth. During these services he frequently spent time with royalty visiting the port and captured a number of French prizes. Legge remained in command of Cambrian until the Peace of Amiens in 1802.The Gentleman's Magazine, July to December 1835 With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Legge was recalled to the Navy and took command of the ship of the line HMS Revenge. In 1805 Revenge was ordered to cruise off the Spanish coast and captured a valuable Spanish merchantship and also participated in the Battle of Cape Finisterre under Robert Calder against the combined Franco-Spanish fleet of Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. By 1807, Revenge was stationed with the Mediterranean Fleet and participated in the Dardanelles Operation under John Thomas Duckworth. During the attempt to reach Constantinople, Revenge suffered ten men killed and 14 wounded. Legge was later part of the naval contingent in the Walcheren Expedition and, with thousands of his men, contracted malaria and was evacuated home, severely ill. Flag rank In July 1810, Legge was promoted to rear-admiral and the following year was appointed to be commander at Cadiz in Revenge. The Spanish port was an important position as it was the seat of the Spanish government during the Peninsular War which was raging at that time. Legge performed well in this position and returned to Britain in September 1812 to become admiral in command of the River Thames. Legge held this command, from the frigate HMS Thisbe until the end of the war in 1815. As a member of the nobility, Legge had numerous royal contacts, and became a Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III in 1801, a position that he held in London until 1812 and afterwards at Windsor, to where the mentally unbalanced king had retreated, until the king's death in 1820. Legge later marched in the procession at George III's funeral. By the time of his retirement, Legge had risen to vice- admiral and been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He later became a full admiral in 1830. Legge never married, and on his death in 1835, he was reported to have left over £3,000 to his butler, £1,000 each to his groom, footman, coachman and housekeeper and other substantial amounts to his other servants. He was buried in the family vault in Lewisham.

Appearance The Karst Shepherd Dog is of medium size, harmonious, robust, endowed with a well- developed musculature and a strong constitution. The tail and ears are hanging. Length of body in proportion to height at withers should be no less than 9 : 8. Skull is a little longer (13 to 14 cm) than the muzzle (11 to 12 cm / 4.3 to 4.7 in). Width of skull (13 to 14 cm / 5.2 to 5.5 in) is equal to its length. Their hair is well furnished, long, flat, with abundant undercoat. The head the front edges of the ears and the front part of the legs covered with short hair. The back edge of the ears has longer and more supple hair. In its upper region, the neck has long hair, stiff and very bushy forming a mane; in its lower part, the hair is longer and more supple forming a ruff which is wider at the set of the neck. The trunk and belly have long hair which becomes less hard on the belly. The tail regularly bushy, does not form a plume. On the back side of the forequarters, the long hair is very supple forming fringes. On the back side of the hindquarters, the hair is even longer and bushy forming culottes. The length of the top coat is at least . Coat is iron grey; especially on the back, a dark shade is preferred; towards the belly and the limbs, the colour turns without visible transition to a light grey or sandy colour, with a dark streak on the front parts of the limbs. The dark mask on the muzzle spreads on to the skull. On the back part of the head it is bordered with grey or sandy or pale fawn hair overlaid with black.

Females are 54 to 60 cm with an ideal size of and a weight of 25 to 37 kg (55 to 81.4 lbs). Temperament The breed standard describes the dog as having a sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It's a good guard dog. Like all large dogs, the Karst Shepherd needs to be well socialized while very young, with people if the dog is to be a companion, and with livestock if the dog is to be a guardian. If the breed's background is taken into consideration, and if the dog is well socialized and trained, he may make a good family dog. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. History thumb The Karst Shepherd is named after the Karst Plateau in Slovenia and more generally after the Karst landscape that extends to Croatia and partly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Gulf of Trieste to the Dinaric Alps. Mostly bred in Slovenia and Istria in Croatia. The ancestral type of the modern day breed travelled with shepherds through this area, and most likely came with ancient nomadic pastoralists. In 1689, the ethnographer Johann Weikhard von Valvasor mentioned the shepherd's dogs of the area in his work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola without description of dogs. In the 20th century, when the landrace shepherd dogs began to be documented as a modern breed, it was first referred to as the Illyrian Shepherd (1939). Karst Shephard and Šarplaninac were considered Type A and B of the Illyrian Shepherd Dog by the Yugoslavian Federation of Cynology for some time, leading to some cases of crossing between both breeds. After comparing typical dogs of both \\"Types\\" the Federation recognised Karst Shephard and Šarplaninac as two distinct breeds in 1968. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognises the breed in Group 2, Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds-Mountain type, number 278.Fédération Cynologique Internationale Group 2 (in English) The breed has also been exported to the United States, where it is recognised by The United Kennel Club in the Guardian Dog Group. The breed is also recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet. During the 20th century there were several periods when the number of Karst Shephards was low. Fearing inbreeding a decision was made to introduce a single male Newfoundland into the population.Kraševec Journal (ISSN C504-9644), 2009, vol. 18/19., pages 3-9. The total number (including puppies, sterilised dogs and dogs not suitable for breeding) of Karst Shepherds in 2008 was estimated between 600 and 700.http://www.dlvkos.si/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=18&Itemid;=37 Short breed description - In Slovenian A breeding program was accepted in 2009 to boost the number of dogs, improve their characteristics and preserve their genetic diversity.

History  The IFPO was created in 2003 by bringing together three existing French Institutes in the area : IFEAD (French Institute for Arab Studies in Damascus, established in 1922), IFAPO (French Institute of near Eastern Archaeology established in Syria and Lebanon in 1946) and CERMOC (Centre for Study and Research on the Contemporary Middle East, est. 1977 in Lebanon and 1988 in Jordan). The IFPO has the status of a \\"Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad\\" (UMIFRE no6, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research).  Fields of research and area purposes  IFPO is active in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and hopes to be able to extend its activities to Iraq and the Palestinian Territories. Its Director-General, who is based in Damascus, is Eberhard Kienle, who was preceded by François Burgat (2008-2013), Jean-Yves L’Hôpital (June 2005-May 2008) and Christian Décobert (Jan. 2003-Aug. 2004). The Institute’s tasks are research, research training, the diffusion of knowledge and cooperation with local and international institutions. These tasks are carried out with the support of the local Ministries in charge of Research and Higher Education, and in close cooperation with both. The Institute acts as a centre for study and research in all fields relating to the ancient and modern civilizations of the Near East. On the basis of the numerous activities and publications of its researchers, the institute aims at raising the French contribution to research to the highest academic standards in the various fields of research related to these civilizations, from the earliest times to the contemporary period. The Institute also trains young researchers for careers in teaching and research.  Organization  The Institute is organised into three scientific departments : Archeology and Ancient History (Director Frédéric Alpi) ; Arab, Medieval and Modern Studies (director : Bruno Lory) ; Contemporary Studies (director : Myriam Catusse). In its different locations, the Institute recruits experienced researchers (at various levels in their careers) from France, from the three countries in which it is established, from Europe and from the rest of the world. They come for a maximum of four years and are selected to take part in the various academic projects initiated by the Institute. It also welcomes receives young researchers (PHD candidates, grant holders, etc.) of all nationalities to take part in its activities. The duration of their stay varies according to their individual situation. The Institute also awards some short-term grants for limited projects. Since many of these researchers also belong to other research teams or programmes in France and elsewhere, the Institute hopes that these projects will strengthen and broaden its academic network.

Physically impaired with osteogenesis imperfecta, she was able to gain an education and became known as a temperance lecturer. The little that is known about Eliza Suggs can be found in her book, Shadow and Sunshine, published in 1906. Childhood Eliza Suggs was born in Bureau County, Illinois, the youngest of four daughters of James and Malinda (Filbrick) Suggs. Both of the parents had been born in slavery, James in North Carolina and Malinda in Alabama; they met while on a Mississippi plantation, where Malinda had four children.1880 Federal Census for Princeton, Bureau County, Illinois James Suggs had fought in the American Civil War, serving in Company I, of the 55th United States Colored Troops, where he was wounded; after he recovered, he reenlisted, this time in Company C of the 59th United States Colored Troops and served until the end of the war.1890 United States Census, Veterans Schedules for Town of Orleans, Harlan County, Nebraska He worked as a blacksmith, farmer and laborer, but after 1873, he was a preacher in the Free Methodist Church.(Elgin,Ill.) Leader, June 27, 1879: \\"Local Matters. Many of our readers remember the colored preacher, James Suggs, who exhorted so earnestly at camp-meeting. He is a resident of Princeton, Ill., a blacksmith by trade and has been a licensed preacher for four years. On Tuesday the congregation at the meeting, by a standing vote, resolved to petition the Missionary Board of the General Conference to appoint Mr. Suggs for missionary work among the colored refugees in Kansas. It is probable that he will be appointed. The family lived in Mississippi, Illinois, and Kansas before settling in Harlan County, Nebraska.1885 Kansas State Census for Town of Plainview, Phillips County, Kansas Her parents had three daughters before her, all born in Illinois.1880 Federal Census for Princeton, Bureau County, Illinois At birth, she appeared to be a totally normal baby, but soon her parents began to realize that something wasn’t quite right. At four weeks old, Eliza Suggs began crying incessantly. It took her mother a day to realize that her infant daughter had broken a limb. After that bone had healed, Eliza’s arm broke. Her bones broke with the gentlest of moves, and they did not expect their fourth child to live very long. However, she went on to live into her thirty-second year. For the next six years, Eliza could barely move, much less even sit up on her own. Where the average child’s day consisted of playing and having fun with friends and siblings, hers consisted of sitting in her carriage before the window, only able to watch the others. When Eliza was around five or six years old, her parents had her burial clothes made. As soon as the garments were finished, they expected to need to use them in short order, half wishing that their daughter’s suffering would end. Much to their surprise, their daughter hung on into early adulthood. In the beginning, the doctors could not find out what was wrong with her. However, as she grew older, and medical techniques slowly improved, she was diagnosed with what was then called Rickets, or what is now called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Education In her early years, Suggs didn’t get around or out much, but when her family moved to a new area, they were lucky to know the teacher of one of the local schools. However, her classroom was upstairs, and therefore virtually impossible for her to access on her own. After close family friends donated a chair more suitable than Eliza’s baby carriage, that was her main mode of transportation and it was decided that she would be able to attend school. Either her mother or her sister Kate would wheel her to school with the rest of the girls, and would carry her up the stairs to the classroom. She would be deposited there for the day, and at the end of the day, her mother or sister would come and get her again, carrying her down the stairs, and wheeling her back home. This allowed Suggs to learn everything her sisters and friends were learning, and resulted in her becoming an educated woman, which was unique for a woman of black heritage, even after the Civil War had ended. Efforts She was a Free Methodist active in the temperance movement.Populist Saints by Howard A. Snyder pgs 694–695 Before her father's death in 1889, Eliza assisted him in Temperance work; after his death, she struck out on her own. Accompanied by her sister Kate, Eliza would attend various gatherings, including Temperance conferences, camp meetings and church services, and briefly speak about her life, her sufferings, and her devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ and how they sustained her.\\"Carried in arms or wheeled about in a carriage, her frail hands and well developed head have accomplished wonders, obtaining a fair education, which makes her a valuable assistant, sometimes as secretary of religious organizations and work. In former years she assisted her father, more or less, in evangelistic work, and she has presided in public meetings with marked dignity and ability. Carried on the platform and moved about as occasion required by kind and willing attendants, I have perhaps never seen more clock-like precision than the execution of an interesting program, at which she presided in a public temperance meeting in the M. E. Church, during my last pastorate in Orleans.\\" C.M.

The program uses GeoFusion's digital Earth visualization system, which renders accurate views of Earth with terrain, satellite imagery, clouds, and other layers. The system is programmed for user interaction, allowing users to \\"fly\\" anywhere they wish to see, and zoom in or out to see details. The system's imagery is derived from Landsat, and features 3D perspective views. Former astronaut Jay Apt assisted with the color-correction of the images, to help get the most realistic colors as seen from space.

Additional partners include the Challenger Learning Center and NASA's Johnson Space Center.  Museums  On the International Space Station, Richard Garriott used the Windows on Earth software to identify targets for Earth photography. The Windows on Earth museum exhibit can be found in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Boston's Museum of Science, the Montshire Museum of Science in Vermont, the St. Louis Science Center, and the Connecticut Science Center.  Garriott Mission  Windows on Earth flew on board the International Space Station (ISS). On October 12, 2008, Richard Garriott launched aboard Soyuz TMA-13 to the ISS as a Spaceflight participant. Garriott remained on board the station for 10 days, conducting educational and scientific programs and experiments. Earth observation was one of his prime tasks on this mission, and he used the Windows on Earth system to help him take pictures of specific targets. After the mission, Richard's photographs, along with ones taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott, who flew on Skylab 3 (1973) and STS-9 (1983), were made available to the public through Windows on Earth. This provides a unique opportunity for comparing areas of Earth photographed by two generations of space explorers, showing how Earth's surface (and the technology of Earth observation) has changed over 35 years, from 1973 to 2008.

It also serves as reference for other Southern Ocean and Antarctic monitoring programs. Several countries collaborate in the survey providing vessels to tow Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) in a near circum-Antarctic survey. Tows conducted between Hobart and the French Antarctic station Dumont d’Urville are also conducted in collaboration with the IMOSAustralian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey. The SO-CPR Survey is supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and its Expert Group on Continuous Plankton Research, which helps promote and develop the survey. The CPRs are towed from research and supply vessels. The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830 km) per tow. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh. These vessels also collect at the same time underway data such as sea surface temperature, salinity, fluorometry, light and other oceanographic-meteorological parameters. All plankton in five nautical mile (9 km) equivalent sections are identified to the lowest possible taxa, usually species and counted. Antarctic krill and other euphausiids are identified to developmental stage. Plankton counts are combined with averaged environmental data for each .

Use of the SO-CPR data for research purposes is encouraged. Data are made available soon after the CPR samples are processed.

Crime in the Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pick-pocketing and shoplifting by tourists. The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City. Petty crimes per capita The Vatican's extremely small size results in a few statistical oddities. There are 18 million visitors to the state each year, and the most common crime is petty theft — purse snatching, pick-pocketing and shoplifting — typically perpetrated and suffered by outsiders. Based on a population of 455 in 1992, the 397 civil offences in that year represent a crime rate of 0.87 crimes per capita, with 608 penal offences or 1.33 per capita.

On May 13, 1981, Pope John Paul II suffered an assassination attempt by Mehmet Ali Ağca. This episode led to a much stronger emphasis on the Swiss Guard's functional, non-ceremonial roles. This has included enhanced training in unarmed combat and small arms. The small arms are the same as those used in the Swiss army. =Swiss Guard killing= On May 4, 1998, the Swiss Guard experienced one of its greatest scandals for over 100 years when the commander of the Guard, Alois Estermann, was murdered in unclear circumstances in Vatican City. According to the official Vatican version, Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, were killed by the young Swiss Guard Cédric Tornay, who later committed suicide. Estermann had been named commander of the Swiss Guard the same day. =Vatican Bank scandal= The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main share-holder. Father Paul Marcinkus, head of the Institute for Religious Works from 1971 to 1989, was indicted in Italy in 1981 as an accessory in the $3.5 billion collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, one of the major post-war financial scandals. Banco Ambrosiano was accused of laundering drug money for the Sicilian Mafia. =Theft of secret documents= The Vatican leaks scandal is a scandal involving leaked Vatican documents, allegedly exposing corruption. The scandal first came to light in January 2012, when Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi published letters from Carlo Maria Viganò, formerly the second ranked Vatican administrator to the pope, in which he begged not to be transferred for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions in higher contract prices. Viganò was later named Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. Paolo Gabriele, the papal butler, was indicted by Vatican magistrates on 13 August 2012 for aggravated theft. On 6 October, Gabriele was found to be guilty, and was sentenced to a reduced sentence of 18 months.

He was considered a world leader in the way society treats victims of crime. He was known as a man of high professional standards, with a commitment to justice, equity and integrity. He became best known for his term as Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service, resigning in protest in 1976 at the corruption then endemic in Queensland, and in particular over the appointment by the Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke- Petersen, of Terry Lewis as Assistant Commissioner. Early life and career Ray Whitrod was born in Adelaide on 16 April 1915, attending Adelaide High School. He joined the South Australia Police (SAPOL) in 1934. He was engaged in detective work from 1937 to 1941. He left to join the Royal Australian Air Force, seeing service as a navigator in north Africa and Europe. He then rejoined SAPOL. In 1949 Whitrod moved to Sydney where he helped establish the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and was engaged in investigating Soviet espionage. He was at the centre of investigations into Vladimir Petrov and his wife Evdokia, who defected in 1954. Policing career Whitrod joined the Commonwealth Investigation Service as its director, moving to Canberra. The CIS became the Commonwealth Police Force (now the Australian Federal Police) in 1960, and Whitrod was its first commissioner. He remained in this post for nine years. He was the driving force behind the Commonwealth Police Act and the Australian Police College, now the Australian Institute of Police Management, at North Head. In 1963 Whitrod attained a Bachelor of Economics degree from the Australian National University (ANU), which he had been studying part-time since the late 1950s. He attained a postgraduate degree in criminology at the University of Cambridge in 1965. Whitrod served as the Papua New Guinea Police Commissioner from 1969 to 1970. This came about after a casual telephone conversation with the retiring commissioner, a personal friend, who asked Whitrod to ask around to see of there was anyone willing to replace him. Whitrod agreed to make some enquiries, but could find nobody willing. He reported back to the retiring commissioner, who said that his departure date was fixed, and asked if Whitrod himself might be interested. Without even consulting with his wife, he agreed. Whitrod became Queensland Police Commissioner in 1970 and immediately set out to eradicate corruption, raise educational standards and bring women into all fields of policing. He organised for the Queensland Education Department to provide officers with classes in literacy and basic arithmetic. As an inducement to attend classes, he offered an extra week's leave for every subject they sat. The Police Union objected with such vehemence that they by- passed both Whitrod and his Police Minister, Max Hodges, and complained directly to the Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Bjelke-Petersen, himself a former Police Minister, endorsed the union's stand and he publicly declared that \\"the Queensland people do not require their police to be Rhodes scholars\\". Whitrod clashed with the premier on other matters. The last straw was the appointment of the little-known Terry Lewis to be Whitrod's Assistant Commissioner. The position had become vacant, and Whitrod chose his preferred candidate. He advised the Cabinet of this name, and the names of two others also acceptable to him and to the Police Union. It had always been the practice for the Cabinet to endorse the Police Commissioner's recommendation for his assistant. In this case, however, they chose Terry Lewis, an inspector, who was known to be a close associate and bagman of the corrupt former Police Commissioner Francis Bischof. He was also less qualified for the position than at least 60 other men. Whitrod believed all his efforts for seven years to eradicate corruption would be undermined if the appointment went ahead, and he asked to speak to Bjelke-Petersen. However, the premier refused to see Whitrod, nor would he allow him to address the Cabinet on the matter. That night, Whitrod wrote out his resignation. Lewis was then appointed Police Commissioner. Prior to leaving Queensland for Canberra, Whitrod and his wife were subject to harassment and intimidation. He would have unordered taxis turning up during the night, sometimes three or four times a night, to take him to the airport. He would receive calls from strangers enquiring about his health, although he had an unlisted number. A heart specialist came to his house at three o'clock in the morning because he had been told by police headquarters that Whitrod was having a heart attack. He had a large load of gravel he had not purchased dumped on his front garden. He became so frightened for his and his wife's safety that he took to sleeping with a revolver under his pillow. A large number of personal files, detailing police corruption, were mysteriously lost in transit between Brisbane and Canberra. Criminologist and later life After his resignation, Whitrod taught criminology as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Sociology at the ANU from 1977 to 1981. He had been awarded a Masters of Arts in Sociology from the ANU in 1972. The Fitzgerald Inquiry in the 1980s revealed institutionalised corruption in Queensland during Bjelke- Petersen's time, and vindicated Whitrod's stance. Terry Lewis had been knighted, but was later stripped of his knighthood and jailed for criminal activity. The Fitzgerald Inquiry led to Bjelke-Petersen's political downfall, and he himself was charged with perjury, the case being dismissed only because of a hung jury, the foreman of which was an undeclared active member of Bjelke-Petersen's National Party. In 1979, Whitrod and his wife returned to Adelaide. He founded the Victims of Crime (now Victim Support) Service, an Australian first. Under Whitrod's guidance, the service went on to establish itself across the nation. He taught as a Residential Scholar at the University of Adelaide from 1992 to 1995. In 1993 he began a PhD in Psychology. Whitrod also played a significant role in forming the National Police Research Unit (now the Australasian Centre for Policing Research) in Adelaide, and the Australian Institute of Criminology. In retirement, Whitrod's extensive community involvement included the first national presidency of the Prison After-Care Council, and membership of the South Australian Government's Commission for the Ageing. He was also the driving force behind the establishment of the Australian Society of Victimology. He was a major contributor to the introduction of uniform crime statistics in Australia. Whitrod's memoirs were published as Before I Sleep (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia). He died in 2003. Honours Whitrod was made a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order (later regraded as Lieutenant) in 1954. He was elevated to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1963. He received the Queen's Police Medal in 1967, was named Queenslander of the Year in 1972, was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1987, and in 1993 became a Companion of the Order of Australia. Whitrod was honoured with a Laudatis from the World Society of Victimology in 1994. In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate in laws from the Australian National University. On 24 September 2007, Mick Keelty presented the inaugural Ray Whitrod Oration. Personal life In 1938 Whitrod married Mavis, seven years his senior, who died in 2001. They had two sons and a daughter.

The village consists of a few houses. The Palestinian population has been removed by the Israeli authorities from the village houses to a new location slightly down the hill. A tradition dating back to the Byzantine period places here the tomb of Samuel. A succession of buildings were erected at the top of the hill, which changed hands throughout history and were for long periods used, either exclusively or in parallel, as places of worship by Christians, Jews and Muslims. The village mosque's main structure, the former Crusader church, is still used for worship and it contains a Muslim cenotaph draped in velvet. Adjacent to the mosque section of the complex there is a Jewish Orthodox synagogue with a traditional tomb of Samuel in the basement. The complex as a whole acts as a prominent landmark. Geography Nabi Samwil is situated atop of a mountain, 890 meters above sea level, in the Seam Zone, four kilometers north of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat and southwest of Ramallah.Jacobs, Daniel. (1998). Israel and the Palestinian territories. Rough Guides, p.429. Nearby localities include Beit Iksa to the south, al Jib to the north, Beit Hanina to the east and Biddu to the west.Satellite View of al-Nabi Samwil The village consisted of 1,592 dunams of which only 5 dunams were built-up.Welcome to al-Nabi Samwil Palestine Remembered. Tomb of Samuel tradition A 6th-century Christian author identified the site as Samuel's burial place, and it has been traditionally been associated as such by Jews, Christians and Muslims. According to the Hebrew Bible, however, the prophet is buried at his hometown, Ramah (), to the east of the hill which is located near Geba, while this site is identified as Mizpah in Benjamin.Gleichen (1925), p. 8 As Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men \\"to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel\\".I Mach., iii, 46, cited in History: shrine and village The Nabi Samwil mosque, 2012 An old tradition holds that the village contains the tomb of the prophet Samuel, whose Arabic name is Nabi Samwil, hence the name of the Arab village. =Byzantine period= A monastery was built by the Byzantines at Nabi Samwil, serving as a hostel for Christian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The monastery was restored and enlarged during the reign of Justinian I in the mid-6th-century CE. Since then, the site has been a place of pilgrimage for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. =Early Muslim period= The tomb continued to be in use throughout the Early Muslim period in Palestine from the 7th to the 10th century. Jerusalem-born geographer al-Muqaddasi recounted in 985 CE, a story which he had heard from his uncle concerning the place: A certain sultan wanted to take possession of Dayr Shamwil, which he describes as a village about a farsakh from Jerusalem. The Sultan asked the owner to describe the village, at which the owner enumerated the ills of the place (\\"hard is the labour,/the profit is low./Weeds are all over,/almonds are bitter,/one bushel you sow,/one bushel you reap.\\") After hearing this the ruler exclaimed \\"Begone! We have no need for your village!\\"Al-Muqaddasi (Basil Anthony Collins (Translator)): The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions. Ahasan al-Taqasim Fi Ma'rifat al-Aqalim. Garnet Publishing, Reading, 1994, , p. 171, (orig. p.188). Older translation is given in Le Strange, 1890, p. 433 13th-century Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, describes \\"Mar Samwil\\" or \\"Maran Samwil\\" as \\"a small town in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Mar in Syriac signifies al-Kass, 'the priest', and Samwil is the name of the Doctors of Law.\\"Le Strange, 1890, p. 433 (orig. Yak., iv. 391; Mar., iii.29) During Islamic times, Nabi Samwil became a centre for pottery production,Sharon, 2004, p. 118 supplying nearby Jerusalem, as well as Ramla and Caesarea.Sharon, 2004, pp. 122 -123 =Crusader/Ayyubid period= In 1099, the Crusaders conquered Palestine from the Arab Fatimids and received their first view of Jerusalem from the mountain upon which Nabi Samwil is built, thus naming it Mont Joie (\\"Mountain of Joy\\"). They soon constructed a fortress there to fend off Muslim raiding of Jerusalem's northern approaches as well as to shelter pilgrim convoys. In 1157, the Crusaders constructed a church at Samuel's tomb. King Baldwin II of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem entrusted Nabi Samwil to Cistercians religious order, who built a monastery there and then handed it over to the Premonstratensians in the 1120s. The 12th-century Jewish traveller, Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, visited the site when he travelled the land in 1173, noting that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied them here, overlooking the Holy City. He wrote that a church dedicated to St. Samuel of Shiloh had been built on the hill.Travelling to Jerusalem-Benjamin of Tudela This may refer to the abbey church of St. Samuel built by Premonstratensian canons and inhabited from 1141 to 1244. After the Ayyubids under Saladin conquered much of interior Palestine in 1187, the church and monastery were turned into a mosque and since then remained in Muslim hands. in 1192, Richard the Lionheart reached Nabi Samwil, but did not take it.Sharon, 2004, p. 119 Jewish pilgrimage, which favoured visits in April and May each year, resumed after the Ayyubids conquered the area, and it became an important center for Muslim-Jewish interaction.Mahmoud Yazbak, 'Holy shrines (maqamat) in modern Palestine/Israel and the politics of memory,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer (eds.), Holy Places in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Confrontation and Co-existence, Routledge 2010 pp. 231-246 p.237. =Mamluk period= During the Mamluk period, Christian pilgrims continued to visit the site, including the traveller known as John Mandeville, and Margery Kempe.Summary Page: Mount Joy: the view from Palestine In the 15th-century, Jews built a synagogue adjacent to the mosque and resumed pilgrimages to the site after losing that privilege during the Crusader period. Though they occasionally encountered difficulties with local notables, the Jews' right to visit the shrine was reaffirmed twice by the Ottomans, and the sultan asked the qadi of Jerusalem to punish anyone who might obstruct their right and the long tradition of Jewish pilgrimage. Mujir ad-Din referring to Jerusalem's size writes \\"From the north it reaches the village wherein is the tomb of the prophet Shamwil, may Allah bless him and give him peace.\\"Sharon, 2004, pp. 119 -120. =Ottoman period= In 1517, Palestine incorporated into the Ottoman Empire after it was captured from the Mamluks, and by 1596, Nabi Samwil appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 5 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, occasional revenues, goats and/or beehives; a total of 2,200 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 113 The Crusader church was incorporated into the village mosque, built in 1730 under the Ottoman Empire. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted en-Neby Samwil as a Muslim village, part of the El-Kuds district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 121 He further noted that the \\"mosk is here the principal object; and is regarded by Jews, Christians, and Muhammedans, as covering the tomb of the prophet Samuel.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 139 -145 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Nabi Samwil had 6 houses and a population of 20, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 158Hartmann, 1883, p. 127, also noted 6 houses In 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as small hamlet of adobe huts, perched on top of the ridge, amid the remains of the Crusader ruins. There was a spring to the north.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 12 In 1896 the population of Nebi Samwil was estimated to be about 81 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 125 =World War and British Mandate period= Nabi Samwil was heavily damaged by Turkish shells in 1917 while fighting British forces, but the village was rebuilt and resettled in 1921.Jerusalem Won at Bayonet's Point New York Times. 1917-12-17.

The operation failed, since its local defenders had been notified that nearby Beit Iksa was attacked and thus prepared for a Jewish assault. Over 40 Palmach troops were killed in the battle with minimal Arab casualties.Tal, 2003, p. 118 From 1948 to 1967, Nabi Samwil was used by the Arab Legion of Jordan as a military post guarding access to Jerusalem.

After Israel's victory and occupation in the war, during which most of the village's 1,000 inhabitants had fled, the shrine became predominantly Jewish, and settlers attempted to wrest control of the area. Throughout the 1970s, the Israeli authorities demolished the historic village built around the shrine, forcing its inhabitants into ramshackle buildings further down the hill.'Palestinian village imprisoned in holy shrine of Nabi Samuel,' Ma'an News Agency12 February 2015. Nabi Samwil was drawn in good part within Jerusalem's municipal boundaries, while the inhabitants themselves were excluded, and its inhabitants were defined in their identity cards as West Bankers, and are prohibited by the Israeli military administration from leaving the village in any direction without authorisation. Since the mid-2000s, Nabi Samwil, excluding the shrine, became part of an area known as the \\"Seam Zone\\", which denotes the land between the separation barrier erected during the Second Intifada, and the borders of Jerusalem municipality.Tourist sites in the West Bank: Wish you were here?. The Economist. 2014-01-06. The only exit from the village is to nearby Bir Nabala via an Israeli checkpoint. Archaeological excavations around the Tomb of Samuel The village, which is not recognized as such by Israel, was designated as a national park in the 1990s and the remains of former homes adjacent to the mosque form part of an archaeological site in the park. The mosque has been cordoned off and the section containing Samuel's tomb has been converted into a synagogue. Partly due to Israeli military restrictions, Palestinian construction in the village is banned. Economic activity is also significantly restricted and residents live in poverty, with many young residents leaving for jobs in nearby Ramallah. Israel states its policies are intended to preserve the site of Nabi Samwil. Demographics In 1922, Nabi Samwil had 121 inhabitants, rising to 138 in 1931. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey in 1945, 200 people resided there. By 1981 the number dropped to 66 inhabitants but was up to 136 within five years. According to the 2007 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Nabi Samwil had a population of 258 inhabitants in 2007.Population, Housing and Establishment Census 2007 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. 2008. Retrieved on 2012-02-29. About 20 Muslim families live there.

He was educated at the University of Oxford, matriculating in 1568 and obtaining degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1573 and 1575 respectively from Jesus College, Oxford. In 1578, he was prebendary at Brecon collegiate church and the rector of Barton, Pembrokeshire; in the following year, he became vicar of his native Llanafan Fawr in Brecknockshire and in 1580 the rector of Nangle, Pembrokeshire, and prebendary of St David's Cathedral, where his father's first cousin, Richard Davies, was bishop. In the same year as his marriage he was appointed chaplain to Sir John Perrot, Lord Deputy of Ireland and Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was appointed Bishop of Leighlin in 1589 (but not also, as is sometimes thought, Bishop of Ferns; the two sees not being merged until after his death). Meredith continued as Dean of St Patrick's, given the poverty of his diocese. He was accused of treasonous correspondence once Perrot had returned to England in 1588, but Meredith showed the evidence to be forgeries. His support for Perrot led to his imprisonment in the Fleet Prison and an appearance before the Star Chamber, leading to a fine of £2,000 (later remitted in return for an annual payment to the queen of 300 marks for 10 years). He was in ill-health by 1593 and died in 1597; he was buried in St Patrick's. Family and descendants In 1584, he married Sarah Bathow (died 1650), who remarried Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus after his death. Their elder son, Sir Robert Meredith (1585–1668) M.P., was Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer and married as her third husband Ann (Loftus) Colley Blount; he was ancestor of the Baronets of Greenhills and Shrowland, Co. Kildare. Their younger son, Sir Thomas Meredith (died 1677), was the Member of Parliament for Old Leighlin, Co. Carlow, and ancestor of the Baronets of Dollardstown, Newtown and Carlandstown, Co. Meath. A large monument in black and White marble stands in the North Transept of St. Patrick's Cathedral to Bishop Meredith.

The base SI units of inertance are kg m−4 or Pa m−3 s2 and the usual symbol is I. The inertance of a tube is given by: :I = {\\\\rho \\\\cdot \\\\ell \\\\over A} \\\\, where : \\\\rho is the density (with dimensionality of mass per volume) of the fluid : \\\\ell is the length of the tube : A is the cross-sectional area of the tube The pressure difference is related to the change in flow-rate by the equation: : \\\\Delta p = I \\\\cdot {\\\\dot Q} = I \\\\cdot {\\\\mathrm d Q \\\\over {\\\\mathrm d t}} where : p is the pressure of the fluid : Q is the volumetric flow-rate (with dimensionality of volume per time) This equation assumes constant density, that the acceleration is uniform, and that the flow is fully developed \\"plug flow\\". This precludes sharp bends, water hammer, and so on. To some, it may appear counterintuitive that an increase in cross-sectional area of a tube reduces the inertance of the tube. However, for the same mass flow-rate, a lower cross-sectional area implies a higher fluid velocity and therefore a higher pressure difference to accelerate the fluid. In respiratory physiology, inertance (of air) is measured in cmH2O L−1 s2. 1 cmH2O L−1 s2 ≈ 98100 Pa m−3 s2. Using small-signal analysis, an inertance can be represented as a fluid reactance (cf. electrical reactance) through the relation: : X = j \\\\omega I where :\\\\omega = 2 \\\\pi f :f is the frequency in Hz.

Cataquiz (born December 29, 1948) is the former mayor of San Pedro, Laguna, Philippines. He is also a businessman and banker, and once managed the Laguna Lake Development Authority from 2001 to 2003. Early life and education Calixto Cataquiz was born in Manila. His parents were Rodolfo C. Catáquiz of Unisan, Quezon, and Rosa T. Ramírez of San Pedro, Laguna. His parents were the pioneers of the balút industry in San Pedro. Calex, as his family members and friends call him, grew up in his mother's hometown. He was an only child from an affluent family. Cataquiz had his elementary education first in San Pedro Central Elementary School (1959–1961), then he transferred to Canossa School of Santa Rosa, Laguna (1961–1965). He spent his high school and college days in San Beda College, Manila where he took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Management). After graduation After his studies, Cataquiz assisted his parents in their various businesses. He became the bank manager of Entrepreneur Bank (Rural Bank of Unisan) which his father had founded in the latter's hometown of Unisan, Quezon. Back in his hometown of San Pedro, he founded the Sampaguita Savings Bank at age 30, but eventually sold Sampaguita Savings Bank to a family from Muntinlupa. Political career According to Mayor Cataquiz, he never really had any intention at all to run for any public office. He was just prodded by the people of San Pedro, particularly former Mayor José L. Amante, to run against then incumbent Mayor Felicísimo Vierneza during the January 30, 1980 Philippine Elections. He lost during his first foray into Philippine politics. During the 1986 People Power Revolution, he led San Pedro's delegation of the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All (JAJA), funding the participants with his own money (for food, transportation, and other protest rally materials). His association with the opposition brought him into a misunderstanding with none other but his parents, who were known close friends of former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. Due to his participation in EDSA, the leaders of the newly installed president Corazón C. Aquino's revolutionary government appointed him as the officer in charge of San Pedro, replacing Vierneza. It was not an easy ascent into power because mayor Vierneza, like most local chief executives at that time, refused to go down, believing that Aquino's revolutionary government was illegal. Thus, a forced takeover ensued wherein Cataquiz supporters clashed with Vierneza's men. Mayor Cataquiz served as San Pedro's OIC from 1986 to 1988. During the 1988 Philippine elections, he was elected into office for the first time. He remained in power until 1998. In 2001, he was seen once again in the second People Power Revolution at EDSA. Upon Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's appointment as president of the Philippines, Cataquiz was tasked to head the Laguna Lake Development Authority. As LLDA general manager, he was able to make Laguna de Bay a member of the Living Lakes of the World. 2007 saw him once again as San Pedro's mayor. He was re-elected as mayor on the 2010 elections. In the May 2013 election, the Commission on Elections disqualified Cataquiz's candidacy because of a prior ruling of the Supreme Court on September 14, 2011 on his disqualification for re-employment in the public service following an administrative case conviction relative to a complaint filed against him by the workers’ union Concerned Employees of the LLDA.

It is the oldest continuously operating boathouse in the United States. It went through renovations as part of the \\"Light Boathouse Row\\" initiative, in which new LED lights were fitted to each of the boathouses. Bachelors Barge Club is currently home to several programs, including the Conestoga High School Crew Team, and the Drexel University Crew Team, among several others. Founding The founding fathers of Bachelors Barge Club were members of the Phoenix Engine Company, a volunteer fire-fighting organization. Initially, membership was limited to bachelors, however the Club opened its doors to married men shortly after its founding. Membership at the club has risen considerably since the early 1980s when the Club counted only 10 members. Now, the majority of Bachelors Barge Club's 150 members are women. Israel W. Morris, a prominent iron merchant and philanthropist, is credited with founding the Club. He was also elected as its second president. Other prominent Old Philadelphian 19th century industrialist members include Charles F. Berwind (coal), William Weightman (chemicals), Maxwell Wyeth (pharmaceuticals), Charles E. Mather (insurance), W. Atlee Burpee (seeds and plants), Clarkson Clothier (retailing) and J. B. Lippincott (publishing). Members of Bachelors Barge Club won Olympic medals for the single and the four in 1924, the single in 1928, and the double in the 1932.

The Boathouse Bachelors Barge Club occupied several boathouses in succession before 1860, when it built a stone building. In 1884, architects Edward Hazelhurst and Samuel Huckel, Jr. designed the Club's social up-river house in East Falls, the Bachelor's Button. The two architects had teamed up in 1881, and maintained a 20-year partnership that produced residential and ecclesiastical architecture including the Union Methodist Church and the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church. In 1893, the Fairmount Park Commission allowed the Club to replace its 1860 building. In 1894, construction was finished on the Mediterranean-style boathouse at #6 Boathouse Row, which was also designed by the Harlehurst and Huckel team. Huckel became a member of Bachelors after designing its boathouse. Today, the building remains relatively unchanged. Wharton Crew The several organizations that row out of Bachelors include the Wharton Crew Team, which is the rowing team for Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. All other University of Pennsylvania crews row out of College Boat Club. Wharton Crew is one of the largest graduate and professional student athletic clubs at Penn. The program owns two Vespoli eight shells –– the Wharton Journal and the Russell Palmer.

History In 1689 the manager at the nearby state arsenal in Jönköping, Erik Dahlbergh, suggested to the King that the crown should support the construction of a new milling work at the waterfalls just outside Huskvarna. The new work should act as a branch of the Jönköping arsenal, where water supply had become irregular. The plans were approved and put into work the same year. Thanks to the Husqvarna branch, the annual production of barrels for muskets from the Jönköping arsenal increased from about 1,500 to over 12,000. Eventually all production was moved to Huskvarna and in 1757 the arsenal was privatized under the ownership of Fredrik Ehrenpreus. In 1867 the company became a limited company under the name Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. Ad for the company from 1899, for their velocipede. When military orders dropped after the Danish-Prussian War of 1864 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Husqvarna begun making shotguns and hunting rifles. They also started manufacturing stoves, sewing machines and bicycles. In 1903 Husqvarna made their first motorcycle. Husqvarna continued firearms production, though mostly civilian firearms except during the two world wars and some shorter periods of military production. In the late 1960s it was decided that Husqvarna should stop making break-action firearms and sell both the rifle production and military contracts to Carl Gustaf in Eskilstuna. Military firearmsGevär modell 1867 *Pistol m/07 *Pistol m/40 *Kulsprutepistol m/37 *Kulsprutepistol m/39 *Gevär (Mauser rifle) m/38, m/96 *Automatkarbin 4 *Maskinpistol M/49 (for the Danish Army) Civilian firearms Husqvarna made numerous types and models of break action shotguns. The first medium caliber bolt action rifles used the same action as the Swedish Army's Mauser m/96. This type was manufactured from 1927 to 1942 circa, known as the Model 46 and mostly chambered in 6.5×55mm, 9.3×57mm and 9.3×62mm from early 1939 Husqvarna started purchasing Mauser M98 actions from the Belgian company FN, labeling the rifles Model 146, 246 and 640. Though the M98 was a strong and well proven action, it was not an ideal situation for Husqvarna to be depending on one of its worst competitors for such a key component. An independent bolt action design was introduced in 1953 as the 1600-series, which was available in several European and American chamberings, including 9.3×62mm, .270, 30-06; 8×57mm, 6.5×55mm, and others. It was a small ring Mauser-like design advertised as the \\"HVA Improved Mauser Action\\". In 1969 they discontinued the HVA action in favor of a cheaper to produce push-feed design, called the 8000. They ceased manufacturing all firearms in 1972. With the army order for the Ak 4 the company was able to find the funding to re-tool the workshop to produce a newly developed bolt action, marketed in 1967 as the 1900-series and continued by FFV (Förenade Fabriksverken) well into the 1980s.

She was known mainly for working at MGM Studios from 1925 until her death in 1949.  Early life  Sewell was born on October 27th, 1898 in Oklahoma. However, she grew up in Idaho, and later moved to Los Angeles. Sewell was one of, technically, seven children. She had four older brothers, one younger brother, and two younger sisters. Although, one of her younger sisters that was born in 1907 died that same year in infancy. Her mother died in 1910 after giving birth to her youngest sister, Ida Grace. Her father was a Methodist minister. She graduated from Hollywood High School.  Career  At an early age, Sewell turned down acting opportunities to work behind the scenes and ended up working as a negative cutter. She started working while still in high school in 1917, and worked during her summer vacations. She then went on to work for Marshall Neilan at First National Pictures as an assistant cutter, working on his 1922 film Minnie. She also worked as an assistant with Viola Lawrence in 1921, who was considered the first female in film editing. After her days as an assistant, she became a film editor and worked on several notable films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer including The Wizard of Oz, though she did not live to see the film's spectacular success as a television perennial in 1956. Her editing style was said to have “packed a punch” as she enjoyed editing together action scenes to keep her films interesting, because of this she was in high demand. She was also consulted by Disney while the original “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” was being edited and helped construct the film. Blanche was a determined woman working on new films every year up until her death.  Personal life  Sewell was married to Leon Warren Bourgeau from September, 1938 until her death in February, 1949. She and Bourgeau had no children. She was Walt Disney’s sister in law by marriage. Her brother, Glenn Sewell, was married to Hazel Bounds, the sister of Disney’s wife, Lillian.

It was released January 20, 2009 through the indie record label, ATO Records. Production =History and recording= Foreman and Watkins began their collaboration in 2005, and eventually pieced together their first song called \\"Betrayal\\". The pair continued to write songs in the same manner because Nickel Creek and Switchfoot were both constantly on the road touring. \\"Whoever was home from tour would chip away at the songs with no real expectations at all,\\" said Foreman. It was \\"mainly just for ourselves and for the love of the song I suppose.\\" The tracking of the record was very organic, with little production involved besides some basic samples the two created from scratch. It was recorded completely in Foreman and Watkins' home studios, and with a few exceptions, \\"every note was written, arranged, played, recorded, mixed, and mastered by Sean and myself,\\" Foreman said. \\"A lot of our sessions consisted of playing new songs that we’d written or songs that we’d learned and then saying, ‘That’s really good’ or ‘I don’t really like that one’ or ‘I like the chorus on that one, but maybe we could write a new verse,’\\" said Watkins about the experience of writing with Foreman.Fiction Family - Published December 31, 2009 (retrieved January 16, 2009) =Music and lyrical content= Watkins and Foreman's writing methods were varied, but most of the time, Watkins would come up with a melody and Foreman would write the lyrics. \\"There’s a few songs where I just gave him the melody idea and he wrote all the words over it,\\" said Watkins. \\"A couple times, there were some lyrical collaborations but it was more about what sounded better and less about content.\\" Regardless of contribution, the credits for the writing of all original songs were split between Foreman and Watkins evenly.

Not to be confused with UK based Photographer and Educationalist John Ogden who changed his name and can now be found at www.johnrae.co.uk. Nicknamed 'Oggy', Ogden is South Australian born and of Anglo-Irish descent, Recent family research suggests there may also be Palawa heritage. He has worked all over the world, his projects spanning diverse cultures and nations including SE Asia, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Europe, South America, the USA, and indigenous Australia.John Ogden's ArtsConnect page His work with imagery associated with Australian Aborigines resulted in the books 'Australienation' (1999), and 'Portraits From A Land Without People', released in 2009 to coincide with the first anniversary of Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd's apology to the Aboriginal people. Early career Ogden began his career as a photo-journalist, and continued his personal development by completing an English degree, with a focus on Film history and theoryA completely permitted view of Aboriginal AustraliaOfficial Website After graduating in 1979, Ogden began his career in filmmaking and advertising. Work in Film and Documentary Ogden credits his documentary filmmaking experience with giving him a good sense of natural lighting, as well as the invaluable experience of witnessing how real people behave in a variety of situations. Notable credits include work as Director of Photography on 'As Time Goes By', Bad Boy Bubby (second-unit, 1993) and Mission Impossible (second-unit, 1988-89). His short film 'House of Sticks' (2011) was screened at Flickerfest (Bondi), Hollyshorts (LA) and several other festivals. Music video Having acted as Director of Photography on over 50 music videos, Ogden has worked with many major artists including Prince, INXS, and Split Enz. In an interview with the ABC in 2007, he recounted the challenge of filming a video directed by Prince, having signed a contract which expressly prohibited conversation with the artist. Ogden credits working in this medium as teaching innovation. Fine art photography Since 2006 Ogden's work has focused on series' of fine art photography, and extensive work with Aboriginal Australian imagery. His publishing company, Cyclops Press, began production with 'Australienation' in 1999. Partly inspired by a conversation in which Ogden was upbraided whilst in England in his youth,ABC feature on John Ogden criticising the near genocide of the Aboriginal populations by the colonial immigrants, and subsequent culture clash, Ogden's 2008/9 work 'Portraits From A Land Without People' is considered to be the most comprehensive pictorial history of the Aboriginal people of Australia produced, honoring fully the Aboriginal cultural code which requires permission to be granted by each individual in every picture. To compile the book, and gain the appropriate permissions, Ogden travelled extensively over a four-year period, examining over 300,000 images, and visiting public libraries, galleries, museums and private collections in every state and territory in Australia. Ogden has described the dedication necessary to complete this task as a 'beautiful obsession'. In November 2011 Ogden released 'Saltwater People of the Broken Bays – Sydney's Northern Beaches', and in November 2012 released the companion book 'Saltwater People of the Fatal Shore – Sydney's South-side Beaches'. 'Slightly Dangerous – The Cyclops' Cypher', released in May 2013, provides an insight into the inspirations and influences behind Ogden's work. In his foreword to 'Slightly Dangerous', photographer Tim Page writes: \\"This is a life well travelled, of a baby boomer who surfs an existential path across six decades, waxing the best of nostalgia against the odds that are self mitigated by the excesses of those times. It is a heritage of the hippest, most gonzo ‘down-under’ attitudes, rendered by images we all wish we had snapped. As if Hunter S.

He was the author of several articles on early modern economic history, a biography on Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and the acclaimed book British Isles: A History of Four Nations, which advocated a multi-national \\"Britannic\\" approach, rather than an Anglo-centric approach to their history, historiography and sociology. Career Born in Liverpool, Kearney read History at Peterhouse, Cambridge in the 1940s. He met his wife while teaching at University College Dublin where she was an undergraduate. Kearney became, in 1962, one of the first academics (a lecturer of history) at the still- under-construction \\"plate glass university\\", University of Sussex, where he taught in a temporary Nissen hut before the arts faculty buildings were completed. Kearney went on to teach courses on contemporary Britain; poetry, science and religion in seventeenth century England; religion and literature in the age of Pascal, and the politics and literature of Yeats and Joyce. Kearney made modern Irish history his major research interest, especially focusing on Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom, and the British nations. While at Sussex, Kearney spent three months at the Folger Library in Washington D.C., where he wrote an article Puritanism, Capitalism and the Scientific Revolution (published in Past and Present, 1964). During his time at Sussex, he also took a sabbatical in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1970 Kearney left Sussex to become Richard Pares Professor of history at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1975 moved on to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was Amundson Professor of British History until 1999. While at Sussex, Kearney edited Problems and Perspectives in History (a series published by Longmans) in which he contributed the volume Origins of the Scientific Revolution. As result of this, he came to contribute a volume in the new World University Library (Science and Change 1500–1700, Weidenfeld, 1970) that was translated into German, Spanish and Japanese. In 1969 Kearney contributed three chapters on the 17th century in John Cruikshank's Sussex- based series French Literature and its Background. Kearney further published his work on 17th century universities in Scholars and Gentlemen: Universities and Society in Pre-Industrial Britain (Faber 1970). A gap of almost 20 years followed before the publication of his later works, The British Isles: A History of Four Nations (1989, 2006) and the collection of essays, Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History (2007). Works =The British Isles: A History of Four Nations= In 1989 Kearney published The British Isles: A History of Four Nations, to strong reviews in the Times Literary Supplement, History Today, The Spectator and the New York Review of Books. It was printed by the Cambridge University Press as a general reader book with plate sections in hardback and paperback, and the Canto edition of 1995, which had an extended bibliography, was reprinted twice. A second edition was published by Cambridge in 2006, which included a new chapter on the nineties and post-devolution Britain. =Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History= In 2007 Kearney cast his \\"Britannic\\" perspective on Ireland in a collection of essays published by the New York University Press in the USA, and by Cork University Press in Ireland. According to the NYUP, \\"Kearney contends that Ireland represents a striking example of the power of nationalism\\" and offers \\"his revisionist 'four nations' approach to Irish history.\\" Personal life Kearney's daughter is Martha Kearney, a presenter of Radio 4's The World at One and Today programmes. Kearney's son is Hugh Kearney, a high school history teacher. In the media In 2006, Kearney reminisced with his daughter about life amongst the development of Sussex University, in a BBC Radio Four series charting the post-war history of higher education.

Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning whether federal law restricted the United States Navy's ability to use sonar during drills given the possibility of a harmful effect on marine mammals such as whales.. In balancing military preparedness against environmental concerns, the majority came down solidly on the side of national security. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his opinion, “the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of marine mammals that they study and observe”. By contrast, he continued, “forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet”. Background and procedural history The U.S. Navy had scheduled 14 training exercises through January 2009 off the coast of Southern California involving the use of “mid-frequency active sonar” to detect enemy submarines. Environmentalists argued that the sonar's high decibel levels may have a deafening effect on whales. They said studies conducted around the world have shown the piercing underwater sounds cause whales to flee in panic or to dive too deeply. Whales have been found beached in Greece, the Canary Islands, and in the Bahamas after sonar was used in the area, and necropsies showed signs of internal bleeding near the ears. In February 2007, however, the U.S. Navy published an environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that found that the use of mid-frequency active sonar would cause minimal harm to marine mammals. The Navy, represented by Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre, \\"highlight[ed] that there was an 'absence' of injury to marine mammals in Southern California despite forty years of Navy training in the area\\". The petitioners were mostly environmental groups, including Natural Resources Defense Council and Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, among others. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the exercises on the ground that they violated NEPA and other environmental laws. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted a preliminary injunction barring conduct of the exercises. On remand from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the district court modified the preliminary injunction to allow the Navy to use sonar if it used mitigation measures. On the Navy’s second appeal, challenging two of the mitigation measures, the Ninth Circuit—\\"widely regarded as an environmentally friendly\\"—affirmed the modified injunction, noting that the plaintiffs (petitioners in the Supreme Court) had carried their burden of showing a “possibility” of irreparable injury and that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of plaintiffs. Opinion of the court The majority opinion held that as an initial matter the Ninth Circuit’s “possibility” test for issuance of a preliminary injunction is too lenient; plaintiffs must show that irreparable injury is “likely” in the absence of an injunction. However, the Court continued, even if plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury (and, too, likelihood of success on the merits), it is “plainly outweighed” by the Navy’s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors. That factor alone requires denial of the requested injunctive relief. For the plaintiffs, the most serious possible injury would be the loss of ability to observe an unknown number of marine mammals. In light of the foregoing, the Court reversed the decision below and vacated the preliminary injunction. The Court technically did not address the merits of the lawsuit—that is, whether the training exercises had violated NEPA or the other federal environmental laws. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissent, joined by Justice David Souter, that sided with the Ninth Circuit. She found that despite the importance of the U.S. Navy’s training exercises, they did not trump the considerations of environmental harm mandated by NEPA. Comments A report published in 2009 by the Congressional Research Service noted that the Supreme Court accepted the case \\"as a challenge to a preliminary injunction, rather than to the merits of petitioners’ statutory claims\\". However, the report observed that \\"the Court made clear, however, that its perception of an overriding national security interest in the challenged training exercises should lead the district court to reject a final injunction as well, in the event the military is found to have violated an environmental statute\\". This was the first time the United States successfully got the judiciary to reject the Ninth Circuit’s “mere possibility” test for issuing injunctions. Other commentators called it \\"a dangerous precedent\\" and \\"a troubling example of unquestioned deference to an invocation of military necessity at the expense of the environment\\" and said that it \\"signal[ed] a marked shift from lower courts’ treatment of NEPA injunctions, raising questions about the availability of restraining orders for NEPA violations in the future\\".

When O'Donovan failed, he turned to industrial espionage, against Ingram's explicit orders not to do anything illegal, violent or risky. Now the factory has been destroyed and five lives lost. Michael suggests having Petersen, Ingram's agent in Italy, arrange for O'Donovan to \\"disappear altogether\\", but Ingram states he is \\"a businessman, not a gangster\\". Ingram decides to smuggle O'Donovan out of the country. Michael recommends recruiting driver Bill Fraser because he does not have \\"a nerve in his body\\" and needs money for a race car he has designed and is building. The team board a flight to Italy, followed by Ingram and Michael. There, Fraser mends his strained romantic relationship with Francesca (he was away for a year). Hiding at Petersen's villa, O'Donovan is displeased to hear that Ingram has arranged for him to go to Bombay via Switzerland. O'Donovan tells Petersen to inform Ingram that he will sell the plans for the \\"fuel intake\\" Ingram wanted. At his team's garage, Ingram tells team manager Thornhill to reinstate suspended young driver Johnny Carpenter and team him with his friend Fraser for the important upcoming race from Florence to Locarno. Ingram then sends Thornhill to the refueling stop at Milan. Ingram then meets face-to-face with O'Donovan and reluctantly buys the plans. Between them, Petersen and his girlfriend Gabriela manage to drug Johnny's drinks. The next day, Ingram calls Bill to Johnny's room. Johnny is unconscious next to a whiskey bottle. Bill knows that no last- minute driver changes are allowed, and if the officials are alerted to Johnny's seeming intoxication, it will cost him his license, as well as the race for the team. Ingram offers Bill a way to save his friend and the team, and also dangles financial backing for his race car in exchange for taking the risk of substituting another co-driver for Johnny. Bill agrees. On the day of the race, Francesca goes to Johnny's room to fetch him, but runs into O'Donovan and Petersen. Petersen holds Francesca captive while O'Donovan masquerades as Johnny. Ingram tells Francesca that if she notifies the authorities, Bill will go to prison. She is then released, though Ingram orders Petersen to follow her. She books a flight to Milan and breaks away from Petersen and gets aboard. At the Milan stop, Francesca warns Bill, but O'Donovan points his pistol at him, so Bill resumes the race. Francesca seeks Thornhill's help; he drives her on a shortcut across the mountains to intercept Bill and O'Donovan without involving the police. Bill pulls over, complaining of a loose wheel or flat, and tries to overpower O'Donovan, but fails. O'Donovan orders Bill to not stop at the last checkpoint, even they need to refuel to reach the finish line. Fearing for his life, Bill ignores O'Donovan's order to slow down, since O'Donovan cannot safely shoot him without endangering himself. Bill then takes the wrong turn, heading back from Switzerland into Italy. Once O'Donovan realises what Bill is doing, he tries to grab the wheel. The car goes off the road and teeters on the edge of a cliff. The two men get out and fight, as Ingram, Francesca and the others converge on the scene. O'Donovan is knocked into the car, which then plunges over the cliff and into the lake. Ingram, struck by falling debris, makes a full confession to a frontier guard, taking full responsibility.

Green (August 24, 1813 – unknown) was a runaway slave from Kentucky who escaped three times from his masters. He escaped once in 1839 and 1846 then successfully in 1848 after being sold to a new master. Childhood Jacob was born into slavery with 113 other slaves on a plantation in Kentucky with only his mother as family. Judge Charles Earle put Jacob to work at age eight running chores and giving water to the other slaves. When Jacob was twelve his mother was sold to a trader passing through Kentucky, all he said about his mother was that she was a good slave. Similar to Mr. Cobb's saying, she said if you did what you're told and stay out of trouble your master would treat you well. . Five years later he caught a white boy stealing from him and when they got into a fight, a man by the name of Mr. Burmey came in and broke up the fight beating Jacob and threatening to cut off his hands for hitting a white boy. This triggered a deep hatred within Jacob and when he finally got the chance, he managed to replace Mr. Burmey's smoking tobacco with gunpowder. No one ever suspected him of the deed, and he got his satisfying revenge. Adulthood In Jacob's later years he did many \\"awful\\" things, but also made daring choices that would lead to his freedom. Jacob at one point in time stole a couple of sweet potatoes, his master found out and ordered him to deliver a letter which he was sure contained an order to lash him. Instead of going himself he found himself a loophole and got one of the other slaves to deliver the letter in his place, this caused the other man to be beat while he avoided it. However bad it was for his friendships, it certainly was beneficial to his welfare. Later (time unspecific), he left the barn door open and allowed eight of his masters horses escape on purpose. When his master questioned him later, he convinced his master that the other slaves must have done it. He was utterly convincing and his master believed him, and then set out to punish the other slaves. Although this caused Jacob personal pain for the suffering he caused his fellow slaves, he did not speak up. Eventually Jacob fell in love with a slave girl named Mary, who was evidently not in love with him and had another lover named Dan. Jacob told her that if she didn't give up Dan and love him he would proceed to hang himself, Mary didn't care. He took a rope and pretended to string himself up, standing on a stool. He tried many ways to convince her he was dying but she took no interest. When he was finally ready to give up, a dog came out of nowhere and knocked the stool out from under him. Now that he was truly hanging, and unable to free himself, he called out for help in genuine fear. She sat sadistically and watched him slowly dying. After howling and yelling eventually the strength in his arms couldn't hold the rope off any longer and he blacked out. When he came to, Mary's master; a doctor stood over him. He never knew who cut the rope. Shortly after this, one of Mr. Burmey's sons forced himself on Mary. Her screams brought Dan onto the scene and without thinking, Dan plunged a pitchfork into the son's back killing him almost instantly. Realizing what he had done, Dan ran away into the nearby woods. After confessing to her master, Mary died that same day after drowning herself. A bounty of 1000 dollars was placed on Dan's head. Two months later, he was caught and taken to former Mr. Burmey's other two sons, Peter and John. The two brothers tied him down and burned him alive, slowly cooking him in a pile of crudely placed wood. In the same year both brothers incidentally perished in a fire, they were drunk as usual and locked themselves into a barn. That night the barn caught ablaze and devoured them, in an attempt to save her son's Mr. Burmey's wife broke into the barn, was struck on the head by a piece of falling timber and joined her boys in their fate. At age 20, Jacob's master had him marry another one of the slave girls. Five months after the marriage, she gave birth to a white boy. When Jacob inquired who the father was, she told him it was the master. Nonetheless, they were a happy couple and lived together for six years, having a total of two children. When the master's wife died, he sought the doctor's daughter to be his future wife. When they got married, she ordered any female slave who had ever been intimate with the master to be sold. Jacob was out running errands when his wife was sold, along with both their children and as much as he begged his master to sell him to the same person his master refused. Significance In the 19th century there were many slaves who wrote autobiographies that were later published. Jacob D. Green is one of those \\"lost\\" voices and his story is one of the many that should be heard. Jacob in particular gave lectures at schools after he became free and gave light to s grim subject. His entire autobiography is located here. Masters His first master was Judge Charles Earle and Mr. Cobb (they were both of authority but Mr. Cobb's position on the plantation was unclear). They was a strict men, who thought that if you did what you were told I did not complain that blacks would go to heaven. Although Jacob attempted to escape from Judge Charles Earle twice, when selling Jacob he gave him a good word to the buyers at the auction (most likely for personal gain). Jacob's second master was not named, but his third master was going to be Mr. Steele if he had not successfully escaped ... Religious views Jacob once believed in God and was one of the most faithfully religious of all the slaves on the plantation. But when realizing he had to escape from his master his autobiography said no more about his views on God. SourcesGreen, Jacob D. Narrative of the Life of J. D. Green. Ed.

Korea National University of Arts was established in 1993 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea as the only national university of arts with an aim to serve as a leading institution which cultivates artists. It has 26 departments in six schools: Schools of Music, Drama, Film, TV & Multimedia, Dance, Visual Arts, and Korean Traditional Arts. History Korea National University of Arts was established by law in 1993. In 1990, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Korea announced a 'Ten-Year Project for the Cultural Development,' and the foundation of a national arts institution was the crucial provision of this project. Until the early 1980s, in Korea, there was no specialized university that devoted its entire curriculum to artistic endeavors. Therefore, many budding artists who wanted to continue their artistic search through professional trainings went abroad. The announcement of the foundation of the national university of arts in 1993 was thus the revelation and manifestation of artistic prosperity in Korea. It is the only national university in Asia dedicated exclusively to preparing talented young artists for the professions of all artistic genres. Korea National University of Arts encompasses all disciplines of arts including music, dance, theatre, film, TV, animation, fine art, design, architecture, and Korean traditional arts. The university consists of six independent but correlative schools: the School of Music, the School of Drama, the School of Film, TV & Multimedia, the School of Dance, the School of Visual Arts, and the School of Korean Traditional Arts. K-ARTS offers bachelor's and master's degree program while providing pre-school training program for promising young students. As of 2003, students enrolled in K-ARTS are about 2600, and more than 730 professors and lecturers are teaching in the newest studios and classrooms.

It is adapted from the 1930 novel My Brother Jonathan by Francis Brett Young, later turned into a television series of the same title. The film was part of an attempt to relaunch major production by ABPC following the Second World War. It was made at Elstree Studios and Welwyn Studios, with location shooting taking place at Aston Rowant railway station in Oxfordshire. The sets were designed by the art director Douglas Daniels.  Plot  The story revolves around the life of Jonathan Dakers (Denison), a small town doctor. He is training to be a surgeon when his father dies. Due to the resulting financial problems, he cannot continue his training. He buys a share in Dr. Hammond's general practice in Wednesford, a poor foundry town. When Dakers notes that many patients have been injured in industrial accidents at the foundry, he comes into conflict with its owner Sir Joseph Higgins, and the owner's son-in- law Dr Craig, who owns the town's competing medical practice. He writes a report criticising the condition of the foundry and buildings the workers live in but Craig, who is also the local Health Officer, deliberately mislays it. When Dakers performs a life saving tracheotomy on a child with diphtheria, and takes the child to the hospital, he is charged with misconduct, as the hospital charter precludes infectious cases. As a child Jonathan Dakers met Edie Martyn (Beatrice Campbell). Years later they meet again when he is training in a hospital. He becomes infatuated with Edie; however, she begins a relationship with his brother Harold, who is killed in the First World War, leaving Edie pregnant. To save her from shame Jonathan marries her, despite being in love with Rachel Hammond (Gray), the daughter of his medical partner. Soon after giving birth to a son, Edie dies, first telling Jonathan to be happy with Rachel, whom he later marries.

Massachusetts gateway cities are \\"midsize urban centers that anchor regional economies around the state,\\" facing \\"stubborn social and economic challenges\\" while retaining \\"many assets with unrealized potential.\\" These communities, which all had a legacy of economic success, have struggled as the state's economy shifted toward skills-centered knowledge sectors (increasingly clustered in and around Boston).  Original cities and the Compact  The designation was initially applied to eleven cities named in a 2007 report co-authored by the Brookings Institution and the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC). In May 2008 the chief executives of the eleven Gateway Cities gathered at the Old State House in Boston \\"to sign a compact to unite their administrations in future efforts aimed at economic and community development,\\" asserting their desire to work cooperatively to address issues of common concern. The original eleven cities are: Brockton, Fall River, Fitchburg, Haverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, New Bedford, Pittsfield, Springfield, and Worcester.  Additional cities  A legislative definition (Section 3A of Chapter 23A of the General Laws of Massachusetts) put in place in 2009 and amended in 2010 expanded the designation of gateway cities with fifteen more locations, for a total of 26 cities. Under the General Laws, gateway cities have a population between 35,000 and 250,000, with an average household income below the state average, and an average educational attainment rate (bachelor's degree or above) below the state average. Updates to the Census data in 2013 led to the addition of two cities (Attleboro and Peabody) for a total of 26 communities. These cities are: Attleboro, Barnstable, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Leominster, Lynn, Malden, Methuen, Peabody, Quincy, Revere, Salem, Taunton, and Westfield.  Impact  The Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus was founded in 2008 by State Representative Antonio F.D. Cabral and State Senator Stephen J. Buoniconti. As House and Senate co-chairs of the Caucus, they were joined by 58 other representatives and 20 other senators who represent Gateway Cities. In 2012, Senator Benjamin Downing replaced retiring Senator Buoniconti as the Senate chair. In 2017, Senator Eric Lesser replaced retiring Senator Downing as the Senate Chair. The Urban Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth was launched by Chancellor Jean MacCormack in direct response to the Gateway Cities report. In October 2012, MassINC launched the Gateway Cities Innovation Institute.

The Lie–Trotter product formula and the Trotter–Kato theorem extend this to certain unbounded linear operators A and B. Theorem 20.1 This formula is an analogue of the classical exponential law :e^{x+y} = e^x e^y \\\\, which holds for all real or complex numbers x and y. If x and y are replaced with matrices A and B, and the exponential replaced with a matrix exponential, it is usually necessary for A and B to commute for the law to still hold. However, the Lie product formula holds for all matrices A and B, even ones which do not commute. The Lie product formula is conceptually related to the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, in that both are replacements, in the context of non commuting operators, for the classical exponential law e^{x+y} = e^x e^y \\\\,. The formula has applications, for example, in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. It allows one to separate the Schrödinger evolution operator into alternating increments of kinetic and potential operators. The same idea is used in the construction of splitting methods for the numerical solution of differential equations. Moreover, the Lie product theorem is sufficient to prove the Feynman–Kac formula.

The Württembergischer Yacht-Club (WYC) is a yacht club in Friedrichshafen. It is located on the shores of Lake Constance, Germany. This club was established in January 1911 as the \\"Königlich Württembergischer Yacht-Club\\" (Royal Yacht Club of Württemberg). History The WYC was originally inscribed in the local Tettnang registry as the \\"Königlich Württembergischer Yacht-Club\\". It began under King Wilhelm II of Württemberg's royal patronage. Soon after its establishment, a small clubhouse was built. Despite living in a landlocked kingdom, King William was a ship enthusiast. He had a vision of a German Fleet reaching deep into the country through its rivers. The king was instrumental in the establishment of the Württembergischer Yacht Club. This move followed the establishment of Yacht clubs in the neighboring kingdoms of Bavaria, Austria and Baden at the time. In 1918, King William was deposed from the throne along with the other German rulers by the German Revolution (German: Novemberrevolution). In 1920, despite the ravages of World War I, the club had 358 members. Old King William II, the founder of the club, died on October 2d 1921. In 1937, during Nazi rule in Germany, the Sports Office of the Reich took away the power and freedom of all German sport associations.Kieler Woche dates & events As a result, the Württembergischer Yacht Club was forcefully merged (\\"Einverleibt\\") with other German yacht clubs, foremost of which were the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club of Kiel and the Yacht Club of Bavaria (Bayerischer Yacht-Club) of Munich to form a massive entity, the Yacht-Club von Deutschland (Yacht Club of Germany).Württembergischer Yacht Club - History The members of the House of Württemberg, the former ruling family of Württemberg, are still closely involved with the Württembergischer Yacht Club. The title of honorary commodore of the WYC was first held by King William II and it was passed on through Duke Albrecht, Duke Philipp to the present day's commodore Duke Carl of Württemberg.

The formula was devised by Prof. Eugene Meyer of the Materials Testing Laboratory at the Imperial School of Technology, Charlottenburg, Germany, circa 1908.E.

It is roughly related to the strain hardening coefficient in the equation for the true stress-true strain curve by adding 2. Note, however, that below approximately d = the value of n can surpass 3. Because of this Meyer's law is often restricted to values of d greater than 0.5 mm up to the diameter of the indenter.Tabor, pp. 12-14. The variables k and n are also dependent on the size of the indenter. Despite this, it has been found that the values can be related using the equation:Tabor, p. 8. P = k_1d_1^{n_1} = k_2d_2^{n_2} = k_3d_3^{n_3} = ... Meyer's law is often used to relate hardness values based on the fact that if the weight is halved and the diameter of the indenter is quartered. For instance, the hardness value for a test load of 3000 kg and a 10 mm indenter is the same for a test load of 750 kg and a 5 mm diameter indenter. This relationship isn't perfect, but its percent error is relatively small.Tabor, pp. 10-11. A modified form of this equation was put forth by Onitsch:.

The darts team of a London public house go on a day trip to Boulogne-sur-Mer in France. Plot On the eve of their visit to France the members of the Hand & Flower pub darts team gather for a drink. The day trip is being organised by one of their regulars who is a travel agent. For some of the team it is their first ever trip abroad, while for others it is the first time they have returned to France since the war. One of the team has developed a plan to buy watches in France and smuggle them back into Britain to sell at a profit. Another, Jim Carver, is going through a rocky patch with his fiancée, who he suspects considers him to be boring and plain. The following day the group meet at London Victoria station and catch a train to Dover and ferry across the English Channel to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Once they have landed in France, despite the insistence of their unofficial leader, the pub's landlord, that they stick together, Jim Carver departs to visit a farm where he had been involved in heavy fighting during 1944 when British troops had arrived to liberate France. He takes some flowers to the cemetery where his comrade is buried. He then meets a young woman, Martine, who he first met eight years before, who invites him to have lunch with her family on the farm. They immediately strike up a chemistry, which his relationship with his fiancée in England lacks. However, his newfound friend is also engaged to a local lawyer. Back in the town, the rest of the group enjoy lunch in a cafe and then break up into smaller groups to tour round the town. One goes to try to pick up his black market watches, another gets drunk and joins the French Foreign Legion in spite of his friends' efforts to stop him. One of the group becomes violently homesick despite having left England only hours before. After attempting, and failing, to retrieve their friend from service in the Foreign Legion, the group begins to drift towards the docks and the ship that will carry them on their voyage home – and wonder what has happened to Carver who has been missing all day. Carver has fallen in love with Martine, and she has broken up with Henri. However, they argue and he heads for his ship without her. Unbeknown to him, his fiancée in London has met and struck up a relationship with an American serviceman during a visit to Hampton Court. Carver seems to realise he is far better suited to Martine, and after he boards the ferry she drives hurriedly to the dockside and shouts her true feelings for him. They agree to meet again soon when he returns to France.

Clickjacking is an instance of the confused deputy problem, wherein a computer is innocently fooled into misusing its authority.The Confused Deputy rides again!, Tyler Close, October 2008  History  In 2002, it had been noted that it was possible to load a transparent layer over a web page and have the user's input affect the transparent layer without the user noticing. However, this was mainly ignored as a major issue until 2008. In 2008, Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen had discovered that Adobe Flash Player was able to be clickjacked, allowing an attacker to gain access of the computer without the user's knowledge. The term \\"clickjacking\\" was coined by Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen,You don't know (click)jack Robert Lemos, October 2008 a portmanteau of the words \\"click\\" and \\"hijacking.\\" As more attacks of a similar nature were discovered, the focus of the term \\"UI redressing\\" was changed to describe the category of these attacks, rather than just clickjacking itself. \\"potential clickjacking\\" warning from the \\"NoScript\\" internet-browser addon Description Clickjacking takes advantage of vulnerabilities that are present in applications and web pages to allow the attacker to manipulate the user's computer. For example, a clickjacked page tricks a user into performing undesired actions by clicking on a concealed link. On a clickjacked page, the attackers load another page over it in a transparent layer. The unsuspecting users think that they are clicking visible buttons, while they are actually performing actions on the invisible page. The hidden page may be an authentic page; therefore, the attackers can trick users into performing actions which the users never intended. There is no way of tracing such actions to the attackers later, as the users would have been genuinely authenticated on the hidden page. Clickjacking is not limited to this type though, and are present in other forms.  Clickjacking categories  Classic: works mostly through a web browser * Likejacking: utilizes Facebook's social media capabilities * Nested: clickjacking tailored to affect Google+ * Cursorjacking: manipulates the cursor's appearance and location *MouseJacking: inject keyboard or mouse input via remote RF link * Browserless: does not use a browser * Cookiejacking: acquires cookies from browsers * Filejacking: capable of setting up the affected device as a file server * Password manager attack: clickjacking that utilizes a vulnerability in the autofill capability of browsers = Classic = Classic clickjacking refers to when an attacker uses hidden layers on web pages to manipulate the actions a user's cursor does, resulting in the user being misled about what truly is being clicked on. A user might receive an email with a link to a video about a news item, but another webpage, say a product page on Amazon, can be \\"hidden\\" on top or underneath the \\"PLAY\\" button of the news video. The user tries to \\"play\\" the video but actually \\"buys\\" the product from Amazon. The hacker can only send a single click, so they rely on the fact that the visitor is both logged into Amazon.com and has 1-click ordering enabled. While technical implementation of these attacks may be challenging due to cross- browser incompatibilities, a number of tools such as BeEF or Metasploit Project offer almost fully automated exploitation of clients on vulnerable websites. Clickjacking may be facilitated by - or may facilitate - other web attacks, such as XSS. =Likejacking= Likejacking is a malicious technique of tricking users of a website into \\"liking\\" a Facebook page that they did not intentionally mean to \\"like\\". The term \\"likejacking\\" came from a comment posted by Corey Ballou in the article How to \\"Like\\" Anything on the Web (Safely), which is one of the first documented postings explaining the possibility of malicious activity regarding Facebook's \\"like\\" button. According to an article in IEEE Spectrum, a solution to likejacking was developed at one of Facebook's hackathons. A \\"Like\\" bookmarklet is available that avoids the possibility of likejacking present in the Facebook like button. = Nested = Nested clickjacking, compared to classic clickjacking, works by embedding a malicious web frame between two frames of the original, harmless web page: that from the framed page and that which is displayed on the top window. This works due to a vulnerability in the HTTP header \`X-Frame- Options\`, in which, when this element has the value \`SAMEORIGIN\`, the web browser only checks the two aforementioned layers. The fact that additional frames can be added in between these two while remaining undetected means that attackers can use this for their benefit. In the past, with Google+ and the faulty version of \`X-Frame-Options\`, attackers were able to insert frames of their choice by using the vulnerability present in Google's Image Search engine. In between the image display frames, which were present in Google+ as well, these attacker-controlled frames were able to load and not be restricted, allowing for the attackers to mislead whoever came upon the image display page. =Cursorjacking= Cursorjacking is a UI redressing technique to change the cursor from the location the user perceives, discovered in 2010 by Eddy Bordi, a researcher at Vulnerability.fr, Marcus Niemietz demonstrated this with a custom cursor icon, and in 2012 Mario Heiderich by hiding the cursor. Jordi Chancel, a researcher at Alternativ-Testing.fr, discovered a cursorjacking vulnerability using Flash, HTML and JavaScript code in Mozilla Firefox on Mac OS X systems (fixed in Firefox 30.0) which can lead to arbitrary code execution and webcam spying. A second CursorJacking vulnerability was again discovered by Jordi Chancel in Mozilla Firefox on Mac OS X systems (fixed in Firefox 37.0) using once again Flash, HTML and JavaScript code which can lead also to the spying of the webcam and the execution of a malicious addon allowing the execution of a malware on the computer of the trapped user. =MouseJacking= Different form other clickjacking techniques that redress a UI, MouseJacking is a wireless hardware based UI vulnerability first reported by Marc Newlin of Bastille in 2016 which allows external keyboard input to be injected into vulnerable dongles. Logitech supplied firmware patches but other manufacturers failed to respond. = Browserless = In browserless clickjacking, attackers utilize vulnerabilities in programs to replicate classic clickjacking in them, without being required to use the presence of a web browser. This method of clickjacking is mainly prevalent among mobile devices, usually on Android devices, especially due to the way in which toast notifications work. Because toast notifications have a small delay in between the moment the notification is requested and the moment the notification actually displays on-screen, attackers are capable of using that gap to create a dummy button that lies hidden underneath the notification and can still be clicked on. = Cookiejacking = Cookiejacking is a form of clickjacking in which cookies are stolen from web browsers. This is done by tricking the user into dragging an object which seemingly appears harmless, but is in fact making the user select the entire content of the cookie being targeted. From there, the attacker can acquire the cookie and all of the data that is within it. = Filejacking = In filejacking, attackers use the web browser's capability to navigate through the computer and access computer files in order to acquire personal data. It does so by tricking the user into establishing an active file server (through the file and folder selection window that browsers use). With this, attackers can now access and take files from their victims' computers. =Password manager attack= A 2014 paper from researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University found that while browsers refuse to autofill if the protocol on the current login page is different from the protocol at the time the password was saved, some password managers would insecurely fill in passwords for the http version of https-saved passwords. Most managers did not protect against iFrame- and redirection-based attacks and exposed additional passwords where password synchronization had been used between multiple devices. Prevention =Client-side= NoScript Protection against clickjacking (including likejacking) can be added to Mozilla Firefox desktop and mobile versions by installing the NoScript add-on: its ClearClick feature, released on 8 October 2008, prevents users from clicking on invisible or \\"redressed\\" page elements of embedded documents or applets. According to Google's \\"Browser Security Handbook\\" from year 2008, NoScript's ClearClick is a \\"freely available product that offers a reasonable degree of protection\\" against Clickjacking. Protection from the newer cursorjacking attack was added to NoScript 2.2.8 RC1. NoClickjack The \\"NoClickjack\\" web browser add- on (browser extension) adds client-side clickjack protection for users of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge without interfering with the operation of legitimate iFrames. NoClickjack is based on technology developed for GuardedID. NoClickjack add-on is free. GuardedID GuardedID (a commercial product) includes client-side clickjack protection for users of Internet Explorer without interfering with the operation of legitimate iFrames. GuardedID clickjack protection forces all frames to become visible. GuardedID teams with web browser add-on \\"NoClickjack\\" to add protection for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge. Gazelle Gazelle is a Microsoft Research project secure web browser based on IE, that uses an OS-like security model, and has its own limited defenses against clickjacking. In Gazelle, a window of different origin may only draw dynamic content over another window's screen space if the content it draws is opaque. Intersection Observer v2 The Intersection Observer v2 API introduces the concept of tracking the actual \\"visibility\\" of a target element as a human being would define it. This allows a framed widget to detect when it's being covered. The feature is enabled by default since Google Chrome 74, released in April 2019. Chrome is the only browser to implement the API at this time. =Server-side= Framekiller Web site owners can protect their users against UI redressing (frame based clickjacking) on the server side by including a framekiller JavaScript snippet in those pages they do not want to be included inside frames from different sources. Such JavaScript-based protection, unfortunately, is not always reliable. This is especially true on Internet Explorer, where this kind of countermeasure can be circumvented \\"by design\\" by including the targeted page inside an element. X-Frame-Options Introduced in 2009 in Internet Explorer 8 was a new HTTP header \`X-Frame-Options\` which offered a partial protection against clickjacking and was shortly after adopted by other browsers (Safari, Firefox,https://developer.mozilla.org/en/The_X-FRAME-OPTIONS_response_header The X-Frame-Options response header — MDC Chrome, and Opera). The header, when set by website owner, declares its preferred framing policy: values of \`DENY\`, \`ALLOW-FROM origin\`, or \`SAMEORIGIN\` will prevent any framing, framing by external sites, or allow framing only by the specified site, respectively. In addition to that, some advertising sites return a non-standard \`ALLOWALL\` value with the intention to allow framing their content on any page (equivalent of not setting X-Frame-Options at all). In 2013 the X-Frame- Options header has been officially published as RFC 7034, but is not an internet standard. The document is provided for informational purposes only. The W3C's Content Security Policy Level 2 Recommendation provides an alternative security directive, frame-ancestors, which is intended to obsolete the X-Frame-Options header. A security header like X-Frame-Options will not protect users against clickjacking attacks that are not using a frame. Content Security Policy The \`frame-ancestors\` directive of Content Security Policy (introduced in version 1.1) can allow or disallow embedding of content by potentially hostile pages using iframe, object, etc. This directive obsoletes the X-Frame-Options directive. If a page is served with both headers, the frame-ancestors policy should be preferred by the browser.—although some popular browsers disobey this requirement. Example frame-ancestors policies: # Disallow embedding. All iframes etc. will be blank, or contain a browser specific error page. Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none' # Allow embedding of own content only. Content- Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' # Allow specific origins to embed this content Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors www.example.com www.wikipedia.org See also Browser security * Click fraud * Cross-site scripting * Internet safety * Internet security * Malvertising * Phishing * Security hacker * Social jacking References Hacking (computer security) Computing culture Web security exploits Social engineering (computer security) ","title":"Clickjacking"},{"id":"19680473","text":"Alfred Edward 'Topsy' Waldron (26 February 1857 – 7 June 1929) was an Australian rules footballer who played mostly for Norwood in the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) during the 19th century. He also played two first-class cricket matches for South Australia.  Early life  Waldron's nickname 'Topsy' was used by his brother and stayed with him throughout his football career.  Albert-Park (1875)  He started his career at Albert-park, playing most of that season in the Second Twenty before being chosen for a match against Melbourne.  Carlton Imperial (1876)  In 1876 Walrdon played a season with Carlton Imperial.  Carlton (1877–1878)  When the club folded, he crossed to Carlton in the newly formed Victorian Football Association (VFA), playing in their 1877 VFA premiership side. At the end of 1878, Waldron was convinced by a friend to go to Norwood and he joined them for their second season in the SAFA.  Norwood (1879–1892)  In 1888, Waldron captained Norwood to victory in the inaugural Championship of Australia. The club took on South Melbourne at Kensington Oval for the title and won the series 3–0. He also captained South Australia in three inter- colonial games and played in six games in all. Waldron was captain of Norwood for a club record ten seasons, and played in nine of their early premiership teams, six as captain. His career total of ten premierships is a record for elite Australian rules football, equal with David \\"Dolly\\" Christy.  Cricket  His two first-class cricket matches were played almost five years apart, in 1881/82 and 1887/88. Waldron failed with the bat in both but took 3 for 18 against Victoria at the Adelaide Oval in what was the only innings he bowled in. One of those wickets was Test cricketer Tup Scott.

For Vaishnavas, this day commemorates the incident in the Bhagavata Puran when Bhagwan Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan Hill to provide the villagers of Vrindavan shelter from torrential rains. The incident is seen to represent how God will protect all devotees who take singular refuge in him. Devotees offer a mountain of food, metaphorically representing the Govardhan Hill, to God as a ritual remembrance and to renew their faith in taking refuge in God. The festival is observed by most of Hindu denominations all over India and abroad. For Vaishnavas this is one of the important festivals. For the Vallabh Sampradaya (Pushtimarg), the Gaudiya Sampradaya of Chaitanya, and the Swaminarayan Sampradaya etc. among others. The Annakut festival occurs on the first lunar day of Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight) in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik, which is the next day of Deepawali (Diwali), the Hindu festival of lights, and also the first day of the Vikram Samvat calendar.Annakut feast Origins of Govardhan Puja and Annakut Krishna spent most of his childhood in Braj, a place devotees associate with many of Krishna's divine and heroic exploits with his childhood friends. One of the most significant incidents, described in the Bhagavata Purana, involves Krishna lifting Mount Govardhan (Govardhan Hill), a low hill situated in the middle of Braj. According to the Bhagavata Purana, forest- dwelling cowherds living close to Govardhan used to celebrate the autumn season by paying respect to Indra, the God of rain and storm. Krishna did not approve of this since he desired that the villagers worship Mount Govardhan with the reason that Mount Govardhan is the one that provides natural resources to the villagers for their livelihood. Trees provided oxygen, the grass provided food for the cattle and provided natural beauty. The mountain was responsible for the natural phenomena that occur in the city of Gokul. Indra got angry with this advice. Shri Krishna, though being younger than almost everyone in the city, was respected by everyone due to his knowledge and immense power. So, the people of Gokul agreed with Shri Krishna's advice. Indra was angered upon seeing the villagers' devotion diverted away from him and toward Krishna. Indra decided to initiate thunderstorms and heavy rains in the city in reflex of his egoistic anger. To protect the people from the storms, Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan mount on his little finger and provided shelter to all the people and cattle of the city. After 7–8 days of continuous storms, seeing the people of Gokul being unaffected, Indra accepted defeat and stopped the storms. This day is therefore celebrated as a festival that paid respect to Mount Govardhan by preparing a 'giriyajna' - a \\"great offering of foods and delicacies to the mountain\\" Krishna then assumed the form of a mountain himself and accepted the villagers' offerings. . Indra, after causing torrential rains for seven days, ultimately gave up and bowed to Krishna's superiority. This story is one of the most recognizable in the Bhagavata Purana. Govardhan has since become a major pilgrimage site in Braj for devotees of Krishna. On the day of Annakut, devotees circumambulate the hill and offer food to the mountain—one of the oldest rituals in Braj. The circumambulation consists of an eleven-mile trek dotted along the way with several shrines, before which devotees place flowers and other offerings. Families create an image of Giriraj Govardhan (the mountain) from cow dung, adorning it with miniature cow figures as well as grass as twigs, representing trees and greenery. In the days leading up to Annakut, fifty-six food items (chappan bhog) are typically prepared and offered in the evening. Someone from a cow-herding caste officiates the ritual, circling the hill with a cow and a bull, followed by families in the village. They partake in the sanctified food after offering the food to the hill. The festival often draws a large crowd, including the Chaube brahmins of Mathura.  Rituals Of Annakut  Annakut is celebrated on the fourth day of Diwali. The fourth day of Diwali is also the first day of the new year in the Vikram Samvat calendar. Therefore, the rituals surrounding Annakut are closely linked with the rituals of the five days of Diwali. While the first three days of Diwali are days of prayer to sanctify wealth and invite greater wealth into the devotee's life, the annakut day is a day of offering gratitude for Krishna beneficence. = Goverdhan Puja = Govardhan Puja is a principal ritual performed during Annakut. Although some texts treat Govardhan Puja and Annakut as synonymous, the Govardhan Puja is one segment of the day-long Annakut festival. There are many variants of how Govardhan Puja is performed. In one variant of the ritual a god (Lord Krishna) is made out of cow dung in horizontal position. After completing the structure, it is decorated by earthernlamps (deepak or diya), seenkh (a material used for broom chaffs), and candles. After worshipping, the structure of the lord is fed by the bhaktas or worshippers, and the ladies fast. Prayers are also made to Lord Govardhan.Govardhan -1 As described in the Bhagavata Purana, Govardhan Puja is chiefly identified with Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill on his finger to protect those who sought his refuge from Indra's torrential rage. = Main Annkut Festival = Vast array of vegetarian foods is traditionally arranged in tiers or steps in front of the deities. Usually, the sweets are placed nearest to the Deities. As the tiers descend, other foods such as 'dal', vegetables, pulses and fried savory foods are arranged. A mound of cooked grains, symbolic of Mount Govardhan, is placed in the center. In Swaminarayan shikharbaddh mandirs, sadhus begin to arrange the Annakut in the morning and finish before noon. = Thaal = In all Swaminarayan mandirs, sadhus and devotees then sing 'Thaal' - kirtans or devotional hymns composed by the poet paramhansas of Swaminarayan. These kirtans describe the food items, and are about praying to the Deities to accept the food. The singing lasts for about an hour, and is followed by a grand arti. Afterwards, devotees do puja and circumambulate the Deities and offered food. In some mandirs, Arti is performed several times in the day as long as the Annakut offerings remain before the Deities. In the evening, devotees take portions of the Annakut as prasad, sanctified food, that has been offered to God and is received as his mercy. In certain mandirs, especially in Mathura and Nathadwara, the murtis are also given a milk bath before being and dressed in elegant clothes and ornaments. = Vishvakarma Puja = Some craftsmen pay reverence to their tools and machinery on the day of Annakut. Annakut Celebrations Today Hindus throughout the world actively celebrate Annakut as a part of Diwali and, most frequently, pair the Annakut celebration with the Govardhan Puja performed on fourth day of Diwali celebrations. Hindus also view Annakut as a time to transmit religious and cultural values to children, ask for forgiveness from God and express devotion towards God. Annakut is celebrated with diyas (small oil lamps) and rangoli, decorative art on the ground made from colored rice, colored sand, and/or flower petals. Many distinct food items, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands, are offered to deities during Annakut. For example, 250 kilograms of food were offered to Lord Krishna at the ISKCON temple in Mysore, India in 2009. Although Annakut is most often associated with Lord Krishna, other deities are also focal points. At the Shree Mahalakshmi Mandir in Mumbai, India, 56 sweets and food items are offered to Mataji and then distributed as Prasad to more than 500 devotees. The Annakut festival is also celebrated annually at approximately 3,850 BAPS Mandirs and centers throughout the world in a day-long event. During the festival, Swaminarayan devotees prepare and offer a large variety of vegetarian food to Hindu deities including Swaminarayan and Krishna, among others. The Annakut festival at BAPS mandirs is often the largest festival of the year. Visitors learn about Hindu spirituality, offer prayers for the new year, partake in the prasad, or sanctified food, and engage in other devotional activities. A devotee at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Leicester, England, which organizes the Annakut festival every year, describes Annakut as being a forum where spiritual aspirants can reaffirm their appreciation for the role God plays in their lives. These gatherings also represent an opportunity to reaffirm a sense of community. At the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England in 2004, 1247 vegetarian dishes were assembled and offered to the deities during the Annakut celebrations in 2000 at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England. The Guinness World record for the largest Annakut ever held was on October 27, 2019 (Diwali) in BAPS Atladra Mandir in Gujarat. With over 3500 vegetarian dishes.

The main building was constructed with a wide clearing at its center, filled with old-growth trees saved during the construction phase. Further, Merck & Co. placed the parking structure underground and created a temporary nursery on-site for the trees removed during construction, in order to make the facility a \\"corporate cottage in the woods\\". The building was originally set on of property and has since been expanded to a campus with auxiliary buildings. The initial site plan foresaw the subsequent addition of two buildings to create a grid of three connected hexagons, however, after a change in management, it was indicated that further construction in the original style would not occur. Instead a conventional office block was built adjacent to it known as \\"Whitehouse Station West\\". In the center of the building there is a park with a small lawned sitting area containing a statue given by Merck Germany. Prior to moving to this location, the Merck & Co. headquarters was located in Rahway, New Jersey. The Whitehouse Station campus is located on an old dairy farm and the surrounding area is known as a more suburban/rural setting than the area around the Rahway campus. As a result, Merck & Co. included amenities such as on-site child-care, a fitness center, baseball fields, and a medical services center for employees. Solar initiative In 2008, Merck & Co. installed a 1.6-megawatt solar power system consisting of 7,000 panels on of property. Among the largest installations at a corporate headquarters, the system is also the largest ground-mounted solar power tracking system east of the Mississippi River. In all, it will provide 7% of the site's power and is expected to \\"reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1,300 tons per year.\\" References Office buildings completed in 1990 Buildings and structures in Hunterdon County, New Jersey Headquarters in the United States Merck & Co.

Since 1949, BMU-2 has been involved in major amphibious exercises and operations in Lebanon, Cuba, Grenada, Desert Storm, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.  Mission  Beachmaster Unit Two is assigned the mission of providing tactical components in support of amphibious operations. BMU-Two provides Naval Beach Party Teams (BPTs) for deployment in conjunction with Expeditionary Forces in order to provide beach and surf zone salvage and to facilitate the landing and movement over the beach of troops, equipment, supplies, and the evacuation of casualties, prisoners-of-war, and non- combatants.  History  BMU-2 can trace its history back to the days of World War II. Early on during the Second World War, it quickly became apparent that the orderly flow of troops, equipment, and supplies across the assault beaches was an essential element to the success of amphibious operations. It also became obvious that some special organization was needed to effect and coordinate mass movement through the surf zone and onto the hostile shore. To accomplish this task, small units called Beach Party Teams were formed. They were trained at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia, and deployed commencing in September 1942. The Beach Party Battalions went forward to participate in amphibious landing in the European and African theaters. In August 2011, the commander of the unit, Commander Robert M. Brown, the first African American Commander, was removed after an investigation substantiated allegations of misuse of government resources.Reilly, Corinne, \\"Navy Fires Commander Of Beachmaster Unit\\", Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, 6 August 2011.

Unlike Longinus, he is not named here Stephaton, or Steven, is the name given in medieval Christian traditions to the Roman soldier or bystander, unnamed in the Bible, who offered Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar wine at the Crucifixion. In later depictions of the Crucifixion, Stephaton is frequently portrayed with Longinus, the name given to the soldier who pierced Jesus' side with a spear. Gospel accounts The account of Jesus receiving a sponge soaked in vinegar while on the cross appears in all four of the canonical gospels, with some variation. In both and , just after Jesus says \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me\\", a bystander soaks a sponge in vinegar and raises it on a reed for Jesus to drink. mentions that the attendant soldiers offer Jesus vinegar while mocking him – moving the mocking motif that occurs earlier in Mark and Matthew to the Crucifixion.Johnson, Luke Timothy, and Daniel J. Harrington (1991) The Gospel of Luke, p. 375 and note. Liturgical Press. In , Jesus declares \\"I thirst\\" (one of his last words) and is given the vinegar-soaked sponge \\"on hyssop\\".Moloney, Francis J., and Daniel J. Harrington (1998). The Gospel of John, p. 501 and note. Liturgical Press. The significance of the act is unclear, though it is usually interpreted as an act of mercy on the part of the soldiers (William Chester Jordan suggests that the word used for vinegar may have been slang for wine). The episode may also allude to Psalm 68:22: \\"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\\"  Medieval interpretation  Many medieval Christian writers saw the offering of vinegar wine as an act of torture rather than mercy. A tradition, supported by St. Augustine and other Church Fathers, developed that the sponge-bearer was a Jew. In art The soldier who offered Jesus the sponge is often paired with Longinus, the name later given to the unnamed soldier who pierced Christ's side with a spear during the Crucifixion. It is not known when or how the name \\"Stephaton\\" originated for this character, though it had become common well before the end of the first millennium.Schiller, 93-94 In an iconographic tradition originating in Byzantine art, and continuing in Carolingian and Ottonian art,Schiller, 93-94, 101, 105 in depictions of the Crucifixion, he was regularly shown alongside Longinus, with their actions shown simultaneously, though in the Biblical narrative, these took place at different times (Stephaton's occurs before Jesus' death, Longinus' occurred after.) This is also seen in Irish artSchiller, 102-103; Colum Hourihane and others suggest the images should not be read as a simple narrative, but rather a mix of symbolism and representation typical of medieval art.Schiller, 93-94; Medieval Christian artists indicated that the sponge-bearer was irredeemably wicked (unlike Longinus), through conventions like showing him on Jesus' left- hand side, without a halo, and/or with some kind of physical deformity.

Star Time is an American variety series which aired on the DuMont Television Network from September 5, 1950, to February 27, 1951, and starred singer-actress Frances Langford. (The 1950-51 US network TV grid [see below] shows the hour-long show as airing both Sundays at 7pm EST and Tuesdays at 10pm EST.) Broadcast history The hour-long comedy-variety show spotlighted several regulars and guest performers. One feature of each telecast was a lengthy skit, written and directed by Philip Rapp, with Langford and Lew Parker performing as The Bickersons, a quarrelsome married couple that migrated from radio as a distinctively-unhappy sitcom man and wife. With Langford as a first-class singer, music was an integral component of the series. The premier telecast spotlighted The Harmonicats, a trio of versatile harmonica players who had achieved great prominence in the 1940s. But the program soon settled on a regular slot called Club Goodman in which the Benny Goodman Sextet—with Goodman, Teddy Wilson, and Terry Gibbs, among others—played jazz arrangements of popular songs. With Wilson's weekly appearances, Star Time became one of the first sponsored national TV series to offer an African-American performer as a cast regular. Star Time was an adaptation of the earlier radio series Drene Time, which had aired from 1946 to 1947. Episode status The UCLA Film and Television Archive has four complete episodes, along with excerpts from a fifth episode. The J. Fred and Leslie W.

Nancy drugged Robert by having their six-year-old daughter give him a strawberry milkshake laced with a cocktail of sedatives. When the drugs had taken effect and the children were out of the apartment, Nancy bludgeoned her husband to death. She then rolled up his body in a carpet and had it placed in their storeroom in the Parkview apartment complex. After her arrest, Nancy admitted to killing Robert in self- defense, claiming that she was the victim of domestic violence including repeated acts of rape and sodomy over a five-year period. She further claimed that Robert habitually abused alcohol and cocaine. The trial began in June 2005 at the High Court, with the prosecution alleging that Nancy murdered her husband; she pleaded not guilty. Nancy admitted under cross-examination that she had bludgeoned her husband to death, but maintained that she was defending herself and further claimed memory loss, testifying she had no knowledge of how she inflicted five head wounds with a heavy metal sculpture. Nancy admitted to using Stilnox, one of the sedatives found in her husband's body, to doctor a bottle of malt whisky when they were living in Vermont in the hope that it would make her husband less aggressive toward their children, but testified it had had no effect on him. Regardless of that, Nancy admitted to trying the same thing in Hong Kong, but testified that when she saw the sediment it left at the bottom of the bottle, she poured out the drugged liquor, bought a new bottle and used it to partially fill up the old one, and then \\"never thought about it again\\". The Kissels' neighbor, Andrew Tanzer, testified he had become drowsy and then unconscious after sampling the milkshake. Nancy admitted making it for one of her children and a visiting child, but denied drugging it, stating she would never harm her children or anyone else's. Trial and verdict The case against Nancy Kissel was brought before Justice Michael Lunn. At the end of the trial, lasting 65 days, on 1 September 2005 the jury of five men and two women unanimously decided on her guilt after eight hours of deliberation. She was sentenced to life in prison.Bei Hu and Hanny Wan, Nancy Kissel's Murder Appeal Dismissed in Hong Kong, Bloomberg, 6 October 2008. Kissel appealed her conviction in April 2008. That petition was rejected. She then lodged an appeal with the Court of Final Appeal on 12 January 2010. The case was heard before a five-judge panel led by then-Chief Justice Andrew Li on 21 January. The defense argued that the prosecution had improperly used evidence, including hearsay, and that the original jury instructions were problematic. On 11 February 2010, the Court of Final Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial, citing prosecution use of inadmissible evidence. Kissel was permitted to seek bail, but ultimately chose not to apply. Second indictment Kissel was re-indicted on a single count of murder on 2 March 2010, with the retrial due to start on 10 January 2011. According to the defense, Robert told his wife on the night of 2 November 2003, that he was filing for divorce and that she was unfit to care for their children. The defense also alleged she had long suffered from physical and sexual abuse. Nancy pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility and provocation.Man, Joyce (25 March 2011). \\"Jurors consider manslaughter or murder in retrial of Nancy Kissel\\", South China Morning Post She admitted to having an extramarital relationship with a TV repairman, and the prosecution alleged that she planned to run away with her lover in the U.S. after her husband's death, and that she stood to inherit her husband's estate worth US$18 million. On 25 March 2011, after hearing evidence from over 50 prosecution and defense witnesses over ten weeks, the jury of seven women and two men unanimously found Kissel guilty as charged. She was sentenced to life imprisonment. On 24 April 2014, the Court of Final Appeal refused to allow an appeal against the verdict of her 2011 retrial, rejecting the arguments of Kissel's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, that the prosecution was wrong to tell the retrial's jury that his client was not suffering any psychiatric illness and that the trial judge had erred in directing the jury. \\"We are not persuaded that the two grounds submitted by the applicant are arguable,\\" Justice Roberto Ribeiro said.

The forming companies, Knight-Ridder, Tribune Company, Times Mirror, Advance Publications, Cox Enterprises, Gannett Company, Hearst Corporation, The Washington Post Company, and The New York Times Company each contributed $1 million to fund the company. Lee de Boer was appointed as CEO. Over its 3-year life, the nine member companies reportedly poured $25 million into the venture. Leadership and management was confused, as the participating companies had different ideas about the best direction for the company; Tribune Co. became so exasperated at NCN that they joined America Online in offering a classified service with them. Small papers worried of neglect and lack of power in the organization, and large papers feared it would take away page views from them if it became too popular. As a result, official links to New Century Networks were often small and hidden at the member newspapers. In February 1998, New Century Networks shut down NewsWorks, its main news aggregation website, and laid off a third of its staff. It changed itself to a search engine of the major affiliated newspapers instead, and moved to reorient its purpose toward advertising. Instead, two weeks later, the board of directors voted to close the company entirely.

Their servers are all accessible from the host names webchat.freenode.netirc://chat.freenode.net and irc.freenode.net,irc://irc.freenode.net which load balances connections by using the actual servers in rotation. In 2010, it became the largest free and open source software-focused IRC network; as of 2013, it was the largest IRC network, regardless of focus, encompassing more than 90,000 users and 40,000 channels.  Characteristics  Freenode is centrally managed. Staffers or staff (as IRC operators are called) have the same access across all servers. A list of active staff can be viewed using the \`/stats p\` command. Some operations that would normally only apply to one server (like K-lines) are propagated across the whole network. Servers are \\"donated\\" to the network, rather than \\"linked\\". The network focuses on supporting peer-directed and open-source projects. Primary on-topic channels begin with a single #, and groups wanting to use such a channel may officially register with Freenode. \\"About\\" channels, which may not be about a peer-directed or open-source project, begin with two ##, and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. = Server software = Freenode currently runs Atheme IRC Services and IRCd-Seven, a set of Freenode-specific patches on the Charybdis IRCd (itself based on Ratbox). In 1999, Freenode ran an IRCd called Dancer (based on IRC- Hybrid), then switched to Hyperion in 2005. Hyperion was then replaced with IRCd-Seven on 30 January 2010.  History  There are 23 Freenode servers around the world . Freenode began as a 4-person Linux support channel called #LinPeople on EFnet, another IRC network. By 1995, after moving to Undernet, and then to DALnet, it moved from being just a channel to its own network, irc.linpeople.org. In early 1998, it changed to Open Projects Net (OPN) with about 200 users and under 20 channels. OPN soon grew to become the largest network for the free software community, and 20th largest in the world. In 2002, the name changed to Freenode and the Peer-Directed Projects Center (PDPC) was founded. PDPC was a registered IRS 501(c)(3) charity from 2002 until approximately 2010, during which it received support from such organizations as the Linux Fund in 2007. On 24 June 2006, a user with the nickname \\"ratbert\\" gained administrative privileges of Freenode administrator Rob Levin () and took control of the network. It is likely that approximately 25 user passwords were stolen as a result. This user proceeded to K-line many Freenode staff members, and most Freenode servers subsequently went down for several hours. Around 30 January 2010, a new attack was discovered on Freenode that had never been seen before in the wild. Internet troll organization Gay Nigger Association of America created a piece of JavaScript that caused users of Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox and SeaMonkey to silently connect to Freenode and flood it. This exploit used an ability of Firefox to submit web forms to a port other than 80 (the default HTTP port). Whilst Firefox developers had blocked most ports some time ago, port 6667, the port for IRC, was not blocked. On 2 February 2014, Freenode suffered a DDoS attack (confirmed by @freenodestaff on Twitter) which caused a partial outage. On 22 February 2014, Freenode suffered another DDoS attack which caused partial outage, followed by several botnets which attempted to attack #freenode but were redirected to #freenode-unreg. After the attacks, several servers remained nullrouted by their providers and, for a short time period, only a single server in rotation was accepting connections. On 13 September 2014, a DDoS attack occurred which caused the network to split for several hours, followed by several botnet attacks in the #freenode channel and against Freenode's services. Freenode's infrastructure team noticed a vulnerability on one of their IRC servers. So far, the team only managed to identify indication of the server being compromised by an unknown third party. Freenode recommended that all users change their NickServ password for safety reasons, and has temporarily taken the compromised server offline until the vulnerability is fixed. A deep technical analysis of the rootkit used in the attack was released on 14 October 2014. In 2015, Freenode was bridged to Matrix via matrix.org. On 14 April 2017, it was announced that Freenode had been sold to London Trust Media doing business as Private Internet Access. On 17 August 2017, Freenode suffered from a \\"fairly extensive spambot attack ... containing child pornography images.\\" In the midst of combating the attack, the operators accidentally set a K-Line banning most users of the network. The spambot attack continued in the following year, involved even more networks and was called \\"Freenodegate\\", seeing the creation of sites against the administrators of Freenode with accusations to favor pedophilia and their reaction through editing the server configuration (IRC usermodes), to stem the spread of those messages and reassure users.  Peer-Directed Projects Center  The Peer-Directed Projects Center (PDPC) is known as the organization which ran the Freenode IRC network, where many prominent open source projects host their official IRC channels. The PDPC was incorporated in England and Wales. PDPC was created to run the Freenode network and to establish a variety of programs relating to peer-directed project communities. According to its charter, the PDPC exists \\"to help peer-directed project communities flourish\\", mostly based around free and open source software projects, and encouraging the use of free software through supporting its development. The GNU Project uses the Freenode network for communication. The PDPC was founded and initially directed by Rob Levin. In November 2006, the board went through a reshuffle and new members were installed. Seth Schoen left and Christel Dahlskjaer, senior Freenode staffer, became the secretary and head of staff on Freenode in Schoen's place. Also joining the board was David Levin, Rob's brother. In March 2013, the PDPC was dissolved. The decision to dissolve was made in part due to the donation levels and costs associated with maintaining its status as a charitable organization in the UK.  Rob Levin  Robert Levin (16 December 1955 – 16 September 2006), also known as , was the founder of the Freenode IRC network and Executive Director of the PDPC charity that helped fund Freenode. A computer programmer since 1968, Levin worked as an administrator and an applications programmer from 1978 until his death. On 12 September 2006, Levin was struck by a car while riding a bicycle at night in Houston, Texas, in a hit-and-run collision. After the collision, it was reported that Levin was hospitalized for several days. He died on 16 September. = OpenProjects = From 1994 onwards, Levin worked to encourage the use of IRC for Free Software and Open Source projects. Levin was one of the founders of the OpenProjects Network (OPN), which quickly grew to become the largest IRC network used by the free software community. The OpenProjects domains were later put up for sale, but did not sell. In 2003, The Register (UK) reported that Levin mismanaged funds intended for the OPN, quoting him as writing that they went \\"to paying bills, to paying the rent, to buying food and necessities.\\"  See also   References   External links  Internet Relay Chat networks Free software Internet properties established in 1995 ","title":"Freenode"},{"id":"19681317","text":"Don't Spill the Beans is a children's game for 2 or more players ages 3-6 published by Milton Bradley Company, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc..

Crack offers a short, intense high to smokers. The Manual of Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment calls it the most addictive form of cocaine. Crack first saw widespread use as a recreational drug in primarily impoverished neighborhoods in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Miami in late 1984 and 1985; its rapid increase in use and availability is sometimes termed as the \\"crack epidemic\\". Physical and chemical properties In purer forms, crack rocks appear as off-white nuggets with jagged edges, with a slightly higher density than candle wax. Purer forms of crack resemble a hard plastic in crystalline form, which is brittle. Like cocaine in other forms, crack rock acts as a local anesthetic, numbing the tongue or mouth only where directly placed. Purer forms of crack will sink in water or melt at the edges when near a flame (crack vaporizes at 90 °C, 194 °F). Crack cocaine as sold on the streets may be adulterated or \\"cut\\" with other substances mimicking the appearance of crack cocaine to increase bulk. Use of toxic adulterants such as levamisole has been documented. =Synthesis= In order for cocaine (in plastic bag at bottom) to be converted to crack, several supplies are needed. Pictured here are baking soda, a commonly used base in making crack, a metal spoon, a tealight, and a cigarette lighter. The spoon is held over the heat source in order to \\"cook\\" the cocaine into crack. A close up of the \\"cooking\\" process that creates crack. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, common baking soda) is a base used in preparation of crack, although other weak bases may substitute for it. The net reaction when using sodium bicarbonate is :Coc-H+Cl− \\\\+ NaHCO3 → Coc + H2O + CO2 \\\\+ NaCl With ammonium bicarbonate: :Coc-H+Cl− \\\\+ NH4HCO3 → Coc + NH4Cl + CO2 \\\\+ H2O With ammonium carbonate: :2(Coc-H+Cl−) + (NH4)2CO3 → 2 Coc + 2 NH4Cl + CO2 \\\\+ H2O Crack cocaine is frequently purchased already in rock form, although it is not uncommon for some users to \\"wash up\\" or \\"cook\\" powder cocaine into crack themselves. This process is frequently done with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), water, and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine, forming free base cocaine and carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Loss of CO2 prevents the reaction from reversing back to cocaine hydrochloride. Free base cocaine separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape. Crack vaporizes near temperature 90 °C (194 °F), much lower than the cocaine hydrochloride melting point of 190 °C (374 °F). Whereas cocaine hydrochloride cannot be smoked (burns with no effect), crack cocaine when smoked allows for quick absorption into the blood stream, and reaches the brain in eight seconds. Crack cocaine can also be injected intravenously with the same effect as powder cocaine. However, whereas powder cocaine dissolves in water, crack must be dissolved in an acidic solution such as lemon juice (containing citric acid) or white vinegar (containing acetic acid), a process that effectively reverses the original conversion of powder cocaine to crack. Harm reduction and public health agencies may distribute packets of citric acid or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) for this purpose. Recreational use A woman smoking crack cocaine. Crack cocaine is commonly used as a recreational drug. Effects of crack cocaine include euphoria, supreme confidence, loss of appetite, insomnia, alertness, increased energy, a craving for more cocaine, and potential paranoia (ending after use).\\"DEA, Drug Information, Cocaine\\", United States DOJ Drug Enforcement Administration, 2008, webpage: DEA-cocaine . \\"Life or Meth – CRACK OF THE 90'S\\", Salt Lake City Police Department, Utah, 2008, PDF file: Methlife-PDF . Its initial effect is to release a large amount of dopamine, a brain chemical inducing feelings of euphoria. The high usually lasts from 5–10 minutes, after which time dopamine levels in the brain plummet, leaving the user feeling depressed and low. When (powder) cocaine is dissolved and injected, the absorption into the bloodstream is at least as rapid as the absorption of the drug which occurs when crack cocaine is smoked, and similar euphoria may be experienced. Adverse effects Because crack is an illicit drug, users may consume impure or fake (\\"bunk\\") drugs, which may pose additional health risks. =Physiological= Main physiological effects of crack cocaine The short-term physiological effects of cocaine include constricted blood vessels, dilated pupils, and increased temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Some users of cocaine report feelings of restlessness, irritability, and anxiety. In rare instances, sudden death can occur on the first use of cocaine or unexpectedly thereafter. Cocaine-related deaths are often a result of cardiac arrest or seizures followed by respiratory arrest. Like other forms of cocaine, smoking crack can increase heart rate and blood pressure, leading to long-term cardiovascular problems. Some research suggests that smoking crack or freebase cocaine has additional health risks compared to other methods of taking cocaine. Many of thes issues relate specifically to the release of methylecgonidine and its effect on the heart, lungs, and liver. *Toxic adulterants: Many substances may have been added in order to expand the weight and volume of a batch, while still appearing to be pure crack. Occasionally, highly toxic substances are used, with a range of corresponding short and long-term health risks. Adulturants used with crack and cocaine include milk powder, sugars such as glucose, starch, caffeine, lidocaine, benzocaine, paracetamol, amphetamine, scopolamine and strychnine. *Smoking problems: Any route of administration poses its own set of health risks; in the case of crack cocaine, smoking tends to be more harmful than other routes. Crack users tend to smoke the drug because that has a higher bioavailability than other routes typically used for drugs of abuse such as insufflation. Crack has a melting point of around , and the smoke does not remain potent for long. Therefore, crack pipes are generally very short, to minimize the time between evaporating and ingestion (thereby minimizing loss of potency). Having a very hot pipe pressed against the lips often causes cracked and blistered lips, colloquially known as \\"crack lip\\". The use of \\"convenience store crack pipes\\" – glass tubes which originally contained small artificial roses – may contribute to this condition. These 4-inch (10-cm) pipes are not durable and will quickly develop breaks; users may continue to use the pipe even though it has been broken to a shorter length. The hot pipe might burn the lips, tongue, or fingers, especially when passed between people who take hits in rapid succession, causing the short pipe to reach higher temperatures than if used by one person alone. *Pure or large doses: Because the quality of crack can vary greatly, some people might smoke larger amounts of diluted crack, unaware that a similar amount of a new batch of purer crack could cause an overdose. This can trigger heart problems or cause unconsciousness. *Pathogens on pipes: When pipes are shared, bacteria or viruses can be transferred from person to person. Crack lung In crack users, acute respiratory symptoms have been reported, sometimes termed \\"crack lung\\". Symptoms include fever, coughing up blood and difficulty breathing. In the 48-hour period after use, people with these symptoms have also had associated radiographic findings on chest X-ray of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), interstitial pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and eosinophil infiltration. =Psychological= Stimulant drug abuse (particularly amphetamine and cocaine) can lead to delusional parasitosis (aka Ekbom's Syndrome: a mistaken belief they are infested with parasites). For example, excessive cocaine use can lead to formication, nicknamed \\"cocaine bugs\\" or \\"coke bugs\\", where the affected people believe they have, or feel, parasites crawling under their skin. (Similar delusions may also be associated with high fever or in connection with alcohol withdrawal, sometimes accompanied by visual hallucinations of insects.) \\"Delusional Parasitosis\\", The Bohart Museum of Entomology, 2005, webpage: UCDavis-delusional. People experiencing these hallucinations might scratch themselves to the extent of serious skin damage and bleeding, especially when they are delirious. Paranoia and anxiety are among the most common psychological symptoms of crack cocaine use. Psychosis is more closely associated with smoking crack cocaine than intranasal and intravenous use. =Pregnancy and nursing= Crack baby is a term for a child born to a mother who used crack cocaine during her pregnancy. The threat that cocaine use during pregnancy poses to the fetus is now considered exaggerated. Studies show that prenatal cocaine exposure (independent of other effects such as, for example, alcohol, tobacco, or physical environment) has no appreciable effect on childhood growth and development. However, the official opinion of the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the United States warns about health risks while cautioning against stereotyping: > Many recall that \\"crack babies\\", or babies born to mothers who used crack > cocaine while pregnant, were at one time written off by many as a lost > generation. They were predicted to suffer from severe, irreversible damage, > including reduced intelligence and social skills. It was later found that > this was a gross exaggeration. However, the fact that most of these children > appear normal should not be over-interpreted as indicating that there is no > cause for concern. Using sophisticated technologies, scientists are now > finding that exposure to cocaine during fetal development may lead to > subtle, yet significant, later deficits in some children, including deficits > in some aspects of cognitive performance, information-processing, and > attention to tasks—abilities that are important for success in school.NIDA – > Research Report Series – Cocaine Abuse and Addiction There are also warnings about the threat of breastfeeding: The March of Dimes said \\"it is likely that cocaine will reach the baby through breast milk,\\" and advises the following regarding cocaine use during pregnancy: > Cocaine use during pregnancy can affect a pregnant woman and her unborn baby > in many ways. During the early months of pregnancy, it may increase the risk > of miscarriage. Later in pregnancy, it can trigger preterm labor (labor that > occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or cause the baby to grow poorly. As a > result, cocaine-exposed babies are more likely than unexposed babies to be > born with low birthweight (less than ). Low-birthweight babies are 20 times > more likely to die in their first month of life than normal-weight babies, > and face an increased risk of lifelong disabilities such as mental > retardation and cerebral palsy. Cocaine-exposed babies also tend to have > smaller heads, which generally reflect smaller brains. Some studies suggest > that cocaine-exposed babies are at increased risk of birth defects, > including urinary-tract defects and, possibly, heart defects. Cocaine also > may cause an unborn baby to have a stroke, irreversible brain damage, or a > heart attack. =Reinforcement disorders= Tolerance An appreciable tolerance to cocaine's high may develop, with many addicts reporting that they seek but fail to achieve as much pleasure as they did from their first experience. Some users will frequently increase their doses to intensify and prolong the euphoric effects. While tolerance to the high can occur, users might also become more sensitive (drug sensitization) to cocaine's local anesthetic (pain killing) and convulsant (seizure inducing) effects, without increasing the dose taken; this increased sensitivity may explain some deaths occurring after apparent low doses of cocaine. Addiction Crack cocaine is popularly thought to be the most addictive form of cocaine. However, this claim has been contested: Morgan and Zimmer wrote that available data indicated that \\"...smoking cocaine by itself does not increase markedly the likelihood of dependence.... The claim that cocaine is much more addictive when smoked must be reexamined.\\" They argued that cocaine users who are already prone to abuse are most likely to \\"move toward a more efficient mode of ingestion\\" (that is, smoking). The intense desire to recapture the initial high is what is so addictive for many users. On the other hand, Reinarman et al. wrote that the nature of crack addiction depends on the social context in which it is used and the psychological characteristics of users, pointing out that many heavy crack users can go for days or weeks without using the drugs. Overdose A typical response among users is to have another hit of the drug; however, the levels of dopamine in the brain take a long time to replenish themselves, and each hit taken in rapid succession leads to progressively less intense highs. However, a person might binge for 3 or more days without sleep, while inhaling hits from the pipe. Use of cocaine in a binge, during which the drug is taken repeatedly and at increasingly high doses, leads to a state of increasing irritability, restlessness, and paranoia. This may result in a full-blown paranoid psychosis, in which the individual loses touch with reality and experiences auditory hallucinations. Large amounts of crack cocaine (several hundred milligrams or more) intensify the user's high, but may also lead to bizarre, erratic, and violent behavior. Large amounts can induce tremors, vertigo, muscle twitches, paranoia, or, with repeated doses, a toxic reaction closely resembling amphetamine poisoning.

In most states (except in the U.S.) crack falls under the same category as cocaine. Australia In Australia, crack falls under the same category as cocaine, which is listed as a Schedule 8 controlled drug, indicating that any substances and preparations for therapeutic use under this category have high potential for abuse and addiction. It is permitted for some medical use, but is otherwise outlawed. Canada As a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, crack is not differentiated from cocaine and other coca products. However, the court may weigh the socio-economic factors of crack usage in sentencing. As a guideline, Schedule I drugs carry a maximum 7-year prison sentence for possession for an indictable offence and up to life imprisonment for trafficking and production. A summary conviction on possession carries a $1000–$2000 fine and/or 6 months to a year imprisonment. United States In the United States, cocaine is a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, indicating that it has a high abuse potential but also carries a medicinal purpose. Under the Controlled Substances Act, crack and cocaine are considered the same drug. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 increased penalties for crack cocaine possession and usage. It mandated a mandatory minimum sentence of five years without parole for possession of five grams of crack; to receive the same sentence with powder cocaine one had to have 500 grams. This sentencing disparity was reduced from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1 by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Europe In the United Kingdom, crack is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In the Netherlands it is a List 1 drug of the Opium Law. = Political scandals = Rob Ford, the 64th mayor of Toronto, was filmed smoking crack while he was in office. Marion Barry, Mayor of Washington D.C., was filmed smoking crack in 1990 in a sting operation.

In mathematics, a superellipsoid or super-ellipsoid is a solid whose horizontal sections are superellipses (Lamé curves) with the same exponent r, and whose vertical sections through the center are superellipses with the same exponent t. Superellipsoids as computer graphics primitives were popularized by Alan H. Barr (who used the name \\"superquadrics\\" to refer to both superellipsoids and supertoroids).Barr, A.H. (January 1981), Superquadrics and Angle-Preserving Transformations. IEEE_CGA vol. 1 no. 1, pp. 11-23Barr, A.H. (1992), Rigid Physically Based Superquadrics. Chapter III.8 of Graphics Gems III, edited by D. Kirk, pp. 137-159 However, while some superellipsoids are superquadrics, neither family is contained in the other. Piet Hein's supereggs are special cases of superellipsoids. Formulas =Basic shape= The basic superellipsoid is defined by the implicit inequality : \\\\left( \\\\leftx\\\\right^{r} + \\\\lefty\\\\right^{r} \\\\right)^{t/r} + \\\\leftz\\\\right^{t} \\\\leq 1. The parameters r and t are positive real numbers that control the amount of flattening at the tips and at the equator. Note that the formula becomes a special case of the superquadric's equation if (and only if) t = r. Any \\"parallel of latitude\\" of the superellipsoid (a horizontal section at any constant z between -1 and +1) is a Lamé curve with exponent r, scaled by a = (1 - \\\\leftz\\\\right^{t})^{1/t}: : \\\\left\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right^{r} + \\\\left\\\\frac{y}{a}\\\\right^{r} \\\\leq 1. Any \\"meridian of longitude\\" (a section by any vertical plane through the origin) is a Lamé curve with exponent t, stretched horizontally by a factor w that depends on the sectioning plane. Namely, if x = u cos θ and y = u sin θ, for a fixed θ, then : \\\\left\\\\frac{u}{w}\\\\right^t + \\\\leftz\\\\right^t \\\\leq 1, where :w = (\\\\left\\\\cos \\\\theta\\\\right^r + \\\\left\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\right^r)^{-1/r}. In particular, if r is 2, the horizontal cross-sections are circles, and the horizontal stretching w of the vertical sections is 1 for all planes. In that case, the superellipsoid is a solid of revolution, obtained by rotating the Lamé curve with exponent t around the vertical axis. The basic shape above extends from −1 to +1 along each coordinate axis. The general superellipsoid is obtained by scaling the basic shape along each axis by factors A, B, C, the semi-diameters of the resulting solid. The implicit inequality is : \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\frac{x}{A}\\\\right^r + \\\\left\\\\frac{y}{B}\\\\right^r \\\\right)^{t/r} + \\\\left\\\\frac{z}{C}\\\\right^{t} \\\\leq 1.

They exhibit a tube-within-a-tube body plan, are externally segmented with corresponding internal segmentation, and usually have setae on all segments. They occur worldwide where soil, water, and temperature allow. Earthworms are commonly found in soil, eating a wide variety of organic matter. This organic matter includes plant matter, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body. It respires through its skin. It has a double transport system made of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid- filled coelom and a simple, closed circulatory system. It has a central and peripheral nervous system. Its central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move digesting food toward the worm's anus. Earthworms are hermaphrodites: each carries male and female sex organs. As invertebrates, they lack a true skeleton, but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton. \\"Earthworm\\" is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is a class or subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were in the order Opisthopora, since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include \\"dew-worm\\", \\"rainworm\\", \\"nightcrawler\\", and \\"angleworm\\" (from its use as fishing bait). Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (translates to \\"big worms\\"), opposed to the microdriles (\\"small worms\\") in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae, and Enchytraeidae. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct clitellum (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.  Anatomy  = Form and function = Earthworm head Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from long and wide to long and over wide, but the typical Lumbricus terrestris grows to about long. Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is Amynthas mekongianus that extends up to 3 m (10 ft) in the mud along the banks of the 4,350 km (2,703 mi) Mekong River in Southeast Asia. From front to back, the basic shape of the earthworm is a cylindrical tube-in-a-tube, divided into a series of segments (called metamerisms) that compartmentalize the body. Furrows are generally externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephridiopores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface, allowing it to breathe. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristlelike hairs called lateral setae used to anchor parts of the body during movement; species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per segment. Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their mates. Generally, within a species, the number of segments found is consistent across specimens, and individuals are born with the number of segments they will have throughout their lives. The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth and, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the prostomium, which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow. An adult earthworm develops a belt- shaped glandular swelling, called the clitellum, which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The posterior is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, it may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened. The last segment is called the periproct; the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment. A segment of an earthworm posterior to the clitellum including all of the segmental structures The exterior of an individual segment is a thin cuticle over the skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through the soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle. Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid- filled chamber called a coelom that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of \\"septum\\") which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments. A pair of structures called nephrostomes are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the nephridium or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the coelomic fluid and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually, two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments. At the centre of a worm is the digestive tract, which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the ventral nerve cord, and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels. Many earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; the Australian Didymogaster sylvaticus (known as the \\"blue squirter earthworm\\") can squirt fluid as high as . = Nervous system = Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm  Central nervous system  The CNS consists of a bilobed brain (cerebral ganglia, or supra-pharyngeal ganglion), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a ventral nerve cord. Earthworms' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia. These are located in the dorsal side of the alimentary canal in the third segment, in a groove between the buccal cavity and pharynx. A pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx. The ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub- pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body. There is also three giant axons, one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord. The MGA is 0.07 mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2 m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05 mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6 m/s. The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.  Peripheral nervous system Eight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the prostomium, buccal chamber and pharynx. *Three pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment. *Three pairs of nerves extend from each segmental ganglion to supply various structures of the segment. The sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of connected nerve cells.) The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the cricopharyngeal connective.  Movement  On the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals. Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer \\"strides\\" and a greater frequency of strides. Larger Lumbricus terrestris worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms. They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies. Touching an earthworm, which causes a \\"pressure\\" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contract. This causes the writhing movements observed when a human picks up an earthworm. This behaviour is a reflex and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus. The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments. The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments. The giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird). The presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience nociception or pain. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics. Enkephalin and α-endorphin-like substances have been found in earthworms. Injections of naloxone (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms. This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many vertebrates. =Sensory reception= Photosensitivity Earthworms do not have eyes (although some worms do), however, they do have specialized photosensitive cells called \\"light cells of Hess\\". These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity (phaosome) filled with microvilli. As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory cilia in the phagosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli. The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm. A relatively small number occurs on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment. Epidermal receptor (Sense organ) These receptors are abundant and distributed all over the epidermis. Each receptor shows a slightly elevated cuticle which covers a group of tall, slender and columnar receptor cells. These cells bear small hairlike processes at their outer ends and their inner ends are connected with nerve fibres. The epidermal receptors are tactile in function. They are also concerned with changes in temperature and respond to chemical stimuli. Earthworms are extremely sensitive to touch and mechanical vibration. Buccal receptor (Sense organ) These receptors are located only in the epithelium of the buccal chamber. These receptors are gustatory and olfactory (related to taste and smell). They also respond to chemical stimuli. (Chemoreceptor) = Digestive system = The gut of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus. It is differentiated into an alimentary canal and associated glands which are embedded in the wall of the alimentary canal itself. The alimentary canal consists of a mouth, buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), oesophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine. Food enters at the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes pepsin to digest proteins, amylase to digest polysaccharides, cellulase to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats. Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called drilodefensins, which help digest plant material. Instead of being coiled like a mammalian intestine, in an earthworm's intestine a large mid-dorsal, tongue-like fold is present, called typhlosole which increases surface area to increase nutrient absorption by having many folds running along its length. The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order—an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer. = Circulatory system = Earthworms have a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord. The dorsal vessel is mainly a collecting structure in the intestinal region. It receives a pair commissural and dorsal intestines in each segment. The ventral vessel branches off to a pair of ventro-tegumentaries and ventro-intestinals in each segment. The subneural vessel also gives out a pair of commissurals running along the posterior surface of the septum. The pumping action on the dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches ring the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and haemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing. = Excretory system = The excretory system contains a pair of nephridia in every segment, except for the first three and the last ones. The three types of nephridia are: integumentary, septal, and pharyngeal. The integumentary nephridia lie attached to the inner side of the body wall in all segments except the first two. The septal nephridia are attached to both sides of the septa behind the 15th segment. The pharyngeal nephridia are attached to the fourth, fifth and sixth segments. The waste in the coelom fluid from a forward segment is drawn in by the beating of cilia of the nephrostome. From there it is carried through the septum (wall) via a tube which forms a series of loops entwined by blood capillaries that also transfer waste into the tubule of the nephrostome. The excretory wastes are then finally discharged through a pore on the worm's side. = Respiration = Earthworms have no special respiratory organs. Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the haemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.  Life and physiology  At birth, earthworms emerge small but fully formed, lacking only their sex structures which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years. = Reproduction = right right right Several common earthworm species are mostly parthenogenetic, meaning that growth and development of embryos happens without fertilization. Among lumbricid earthworms, parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives many times. Parthenogenesis in some Aporrectodea trapezoides lineages arose 6.4 to 1.1 million years ago from sexual ancestors. A few species exhibit pseudogamous parthogenesis, meaning that mating is necessary to stimulate reproduction, even though no male genetic material passes to the offspring.Cosín D.J.D., Novo M., Fernández R. (2011) Reproduction of Earthworms: Sexual Selection and Parthenogenesis. In: Karaca A. (eds) Biology of Earthworms. Soil Biology, vol 24. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp. 76ff. Earthworm mating occurs on the surface, most often at night. Earthworms are hermaphrodites; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of testes contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of seminal vesicles produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of spermathecae are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation. As a result, segment 15 of one worm exudes sperm into segments 9 and 10 with its storage vesicles of its mate. Some species use external spermatophores for sperm transfer. In Hormogaster samnitica and Hormogaster elisae transcriptome DNA libraries were sequenced and two sex pheromones, Attractin and Temptin, were detected in all tissue samples of both species. Sex pheromones are probably important in earthworms because they live in an environment where chemical signaling may play a crucial role in attracting a partner and in facilitating outcrossing. Outcrossing would provide the benefit of masking the expression of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny (see Complementation). Copulation and reproduction are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The clitellum becomes very reddish to pinkish in colour. Sometime after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. Thus each worm becomes the genetic father of some of their offspring and the genetic mother of the rest. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator (cocoon) in which the embryonic worms develop. Hence fertilization is external. The cocoon is then deposited in the soil.After three weeks about 2 to 20 young ones hatch with an average of 4. Development is direct i.e.without formation of any larva. = Locomotion = Close up of an earthworm in garden soil Earthworms travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body (peristalsis). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny clawlike bristles (setae) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. As a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels, worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight. = Regeneration = Earthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G.E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but \\"because little interest was shown\\", Gates (1972) published only a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species. Gates's reports included: *Eisenia fetida (Savigny, 1826) with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from one. *Lumbricus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758) replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found. *Perionyx excavatus (Perrier, 1872) readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21. *Lampito mauritii (Kinberg, 1867) with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from Sarcophaga sp. larval infestation. *Criodrilus lacuum (Hoffmeister, 1845) also has prodigious regenerative capacity with 'head' regeneration from as far back as 40/41. An unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.  Taxonomy and distribution  Within the world of taxonomy, the stable 'Classical System' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, \\"The family-level classification of the megascolecid earthworms is in chaos.\\" Over the years, many scientists have developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated. The classification system used here which was developed by Blakemore (2000), is a modern reversion to the Classical System that is historically proven and widely accepted. Categorization of a megadrile earthworm into one of its taxonomic families under suborders Lumbricina and Moniligastrida is based on such features as the makeup of the clitellum, the location and disposition of the sex features (pores, prostatic glands, etc.), number of gizzards, and body shape. Currently, over 6,000 species of terrestrial earthworms are named, as provided in a species name database, but the number of synonyms is unknown. The families, with their known distributions or origins: * Acanthodrilidae – (Gondwanan or Pangaean?) * Ailoscolecidae – the Pyrenees and the southeast USA * Almidae – tropical equatorial (South America, Africa, Indo-Asia) * Benhamiinae – Ethiopian, Neotropical (a possible subfamily of Octochaetidae) * Criodrilidae – southwestern Palaearctic: Europe, Middle East, Russia and Siberia to Pacific coast; Japan (Biwadrilus); mainly aquatic * Diplocardiinae/-idae – Gondwanan or Laurasian? (a subfamily of Acanthodrilidae) * Enchytraeidae – cosmopolitan but uncommon in tropics (usually classed with Microdriles) * Eudrilidae – Tropical Africa south of the Sahara * Exxidae – Neotropical: Central America and the Caribbean * Glossoscolecidae – Neotropical: Central and South America, Caribbean * Haplotaxidae – cosmopolitan distribution (usually classed with Microdriles) * Hormogastridae – Mediterranean * Kynotidae – Malagasian: Madagascar * Lumbricidae – Holarctic: North America, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia to Japan * Lutodrilidae – Louisiana the southeast USA * Megascolecidae – (Pangaean?) * Microchaetidae – Terrestrial in Africa especially South African grasslands * Moniligastridae – Oriental and Indian subregion * Ocnerodrilidae – Neotropics, Africa; India * Octochaetidae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental, Ethiopian, Neotropical * Octochaetinae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental (subfamily if Benhamiinae is accepted) * Sparganophilidae – Nearctic, Neotropical: North and Central America * Tumakidae – Colombia, South America = As an invasive species = From a total of around 7,000 species, only about 150 species are widely distributed around the world. These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.  Ecology  Permanent vertical burrow Earthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at the soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (epigeic) e.g. Eisenia fetida; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within the soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10–30 cm of soil (endogeic); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (anecic, meaning \\"reaching up\\"), e.g. Lumbricus terrestris. Earthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, aeration, and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is pH, but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favour neutral to slightly acidic soils. Lumbricus Terrestris is still present in a pH of 5.4, Dendrobaena octaedra at a pH of 4.3 and some Megascolecidae are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into diapause. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4. Earthworms are preyed upon by many species of birds (e.g. robins, starlings, thrushes, gulls, crows), snakes, wood turtles, mammals (e.g. bears, boars, foxes, hedgehogs, pigs, moles ) and invertebrates (e.g. ants , flatworms, ground beetles and other beetles, snails, spiders, and slugs). Earthworms have many internal parasites, including protozoa, platyhelminthes, and nematodes; they can be found in the worms' blood, seminal vesicles, coelom, or intestine, or in their cocoons. Nitrogenous fertilizers tend to create acidic conditions, which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as DDT, lime sulphur, and lead arsenate. In Australia, changes in farming practices such as the application of superphosphates on pastures and a switch from pastoral farming to arable farming had a devastating effect on populations of the giant Gippsland earthworm, leading to their classification as a protected species. Globally, certain earthworms populations have been devastated by deviation from organic production and the spraying of synthetic fertilizers and biocides, with at least three species now listed as extinct but many more endangered. Vermicomposting of all organic \\"wastes\\" and addition of this organic matter, preferably as a surface mulch, on a regular basis, will provide earthworms with their food and nutrient requirements, and will create the optimum conditions of temperature and moisture that will naturally stimulate their activity. This earthworm activity aerates and mixes the soil, and is conducive to mineralization of nutrients and their uptake by vegetation. Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with soil fertility, an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by farmers and gardeners.NSW Department of Primary Industries, How earthworms can help your soilGalveston County Master Gardener Association, Beneficials in the garden: #38 Earthworms As long ago as 1881 Charles Darwin wrote: \\"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.\\" Devil's coach horse beetle preying on Lumbricus sp. Also, while, as the name suggests, the main habitat of earthworms is in soil, they are not restricted to this habitat. The brandling worm Eisenia fetida lives in decaying plant matter and manure. Arctiostrotus vancouverensis from Vancouver Island and the Olympic Peninsula is generally found in decaying conifer logs. Aporrectodea limicola, Sparganophilus spp., and several others are found in mud in streams. Some species are arboreal, some aquatic and some euryhaline (salt-water tolerant) and littoral (living on the sea-shore, e.g. Pontodrilus litoralis). Even in the soil species, special habitats, such as soils derived from serpentine, have an earthworm fauna of their own. = Environmental impacts = The major benefits of earthworm activities to soil fertility for agriculture can be summarized as: * Biological: In many soils, earthworms play a major role in the conversion of large pieces of organic matter into rich humus, thus improving soil fertility. This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf, partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 per cent more humus than the top 9\\" (23 cm) of soil in which the worm is living. Faeces in the form of casts * Chemical: In addition to dead organic matter, the earthworm also ingests any other soil particles that are small enough — including sand grains up to 1/20 of an inch (1.25 mm) — into its gizzard, wherein those minute fragments of grit grind everything into a fine paste which is then digested in the intestine. When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen, seven times richer in available phosphates, and 11 times richer in available potassium than the surrounding upper 6 inches (150 mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5 kg (10 lb) per worm per year. * Physical: The earthworm's burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the soil structure, enabling processes of aeration and drainage. Permaculture co-founder Bill Mollison points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms \\"act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)\\". Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see Bioturbation). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil mucus) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality. In podzol soils, earthworms can obliterate the characteristic banded appearance of the soil profile by mixing the organic (LFH), eluvial (E) and upper illuvial (B) horizons to create a single dark Ap horizon. https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/files/publications/pdfs/Fisher_Ecology_1928.pdfhttps://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.4141/cjss64-005 Some Effects of Earthworm Invasion in Virgin Podzols Earthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through fragmentation & mixing of plant debris – physical grinding & chemical digestion. The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted. Dr. W. E. Shewell-Cooper observed \\"tremendous numerical differences between adjacent gardens\\", and worm populations are affected by a host of environmental factors, many of which can be influenced by good management practices on the part of the gardener or farmer. Darwin estimated that arable land contains up to 53,000 worms per acre (13/m2), but more recent research has produced figures suggesting that even poor soil may support 250,000/acre (62/m2), whilst rich fertile farmland may have up to 1,750,000/acre (432/m2), meaning that the weight of earthworms beneath a farmer's soil could be greater than that of the livestock upon its surface. Richly organic topsoil populations of earthworms are much higher – averaging 500 worms m−2 and up to 400 gm−2 – such that, for the 7 billion of us, each person alive today has support of 7 million earthworms. The ability to break down organic materials and excrete concentrated nutrients makes the earthworm a functional contributor in restoration projects. In response to ecosystem disturbances, some sites have utilized earthworms to prepare soil for the return of native flora. Research from the Station d'écologie Tropicale de Lamto asserts that the earthworms positively influence the rate of macroaggregate formation, an important feature for soil structure. The stability of aggregates in response to water was also found to be improved when constructed by earthworms. Though not fully quantified yet, Greenhouse gas emissions of earthworms likely contribute to global warming, especially since top-dwelling earthworms increase the speed of carbon cycles and have been spread by humans into many new geographies.  Economic impact  Earthworms being raised at La Chonita Hacienda in Mexico Various species of worms are used in vermiculture, the practice of feeding organic waste to earthworms to decompose food waste. These are usually Eisenia fetida (or its close relative Eisenia andrei) or the Brandling worm, commonly known as the tiger worm or red wiggler. They are distinct from soil-dwelling earthworms. In the tropics, the African nightcrawler Eudrilus eugeniae and the Indian blue Perionyx excavatus are used. Earthworms are sold all over the world; the market is sizable. According to Doug Collicut, \\"In 1980, 370 million worms were exported from Canada, with a Canadian export value of $13 million and an American retail value of $54 million.\\" Earthworms provide an excellent source of protein for fish, fowl and pigs but were also used traditionally for human consumption. Noke is a culinary term used by the Māori of New Zealand, and refers to earthworms which are considered delicacies for their chiefs.

Aerial bombs include a vast range and complexity of designs, from unguided gravity bombs to guided bombs, hand tossed from a vehicle, to needing a large specially built delivery vehicle; or perhaps be the vehicle itself such as a glide bomb, instant detonation or delay-action bomb.

Reliability Not all bombs dropped detonate; failures are common. It was estimated that during the Second World War about 10% of German bombs failed to detonate, and that Allied bombs had a failure rate of 15% or 20%, especially if they hit soft soil and used a pistol-type detonating mechanism rather than fuzes. A great many bombs were dropped during the war; thousands of unexploded bombs which may be able to detonate are discovered every year, particularly in Germany, and have to be defused or detonated in a controlled explosion, in some cases requiring evacuation of thousands of people beforehand. Old bombs occasionally detonate when disturbed, or when a faulty time fuze eventually functions, showing that precautions are still essential when dealing with them.

Today these buildings serve a variety of purposes, ranging from housing for educational groups to administrative offices for the non-profit Pigeon Key Foundation. The former Assistant Bridge Tender's House has been converted into a small museum featuring artifacts and images from Pigeon Key's colorful past. It is located off the old Seven Mile Bridge, at approximately mile marker 45, west of Knight's Key, (city of Marathon in the middle Florida Keys) and just east of Moser Channel, which is the deepest section of the span. The island was originally known as \\"Cayo Paloma\\" (literally translated as \\"Pigeon Key\\") on many old Spanish charts - said to have been named for large flocks of white-crowned pigeons (Columba leucocephala Linnaeus) which once roosted there. During the building of Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad Key West Extension between 1908 and 1912, there were at times as many as 400 workers housed on the island. While these workers built many bridges along the route through the lower keys, the Seven Mile Bridge, spanning the gap between Knight's Key and Little Duck Key remains the largest and most impressive component of what was once referred to as \\"the 8th Wonder of the World\\". A number of buildings from the Flagler era remain on the island and are now part of the Pigeon Key Historic District.

Service history  SS Hisko was built for the United States Shipping Board by the Chester Ship Building Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, and launched 15 October 1917. Acquired by the U.S. Navy for World War I service, she was designated with Id. No. 1953 and commissioned as USS Hisko on 6 December 1917 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lieutenant Commander Louis E. Congdon in command. USS Hisko at Trepassey Bay in May 1919. After two short runs from New York City to Hampton Roads, Virginia, Hisko sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, for England in late December 1917 with a transatlantic convoy. She discharged her cargo of fuel oil into U.S. Navy tanks at Devonport, England, and returned to the United States. She left Norfolk on her second eastbound voyage on 26 January 1918, arriving in Plymouth, England, through severe winter storms on 12 February 1918. She returned to New York on 8 March 1918. Sailors pose with a gun aboard USS Hisko sometime between 3 and 18 May 1918 during a voyage from New York City to Plymouth, England.In the following year and a half, the tanker made eleven similar voyages carrying fuel oil to American ships in such scattered points as Devonport, England; Brest, France; the Panama Canal Zone; Ponta Delgada in the Azores; Glasgow, Scotland; and Newfoundland. Hisko took on oil at New York for most of this period, although she did make three trips to the Gulf of Mexico to load fuel at Port Arthur, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Several ships in her convoys, including a French cruiser, were torpedoed by German U-boats, but Hisko escaped unscathed with her valuable cargo.  Incidents  On 3 May 1918, Hisko departed New York City on a voyage to Plymouth, England. During the night of 12 May 1918, while her convoy was engulfed in dense fog, Hisko radioed that she had been in collision with an unknown vessel. This was probably the cargo ship , which appears to have collided with Hisko after suffering a steering casualty. Zaanland sank before salvage attempts could begin. Hisko arrived at Plymouth safely on 18 May 1918. During a return voyage to New York, Hisko was again involved in a collision. On the night of 5-6 September 1918 in high seas and fog, Hisko was in collision with the 3,121-gross ton United Fruit Company passenger-cargo ship SS Almirante south of the Brigantine Shoals at approximately , some 16 nautical miles (30 km) off the coast of New Jersey near Atlantic City. Despite substantial damage to her bow, Hisko was able to continue to New York, but Almirante sank quickly in some 70 feet (21 meters) of water. Due to the immediate actions of Hisko′s crew and the response of the United States Lifesaving Service from Atlantic City, only five or seven lives were lost (reports differ) among the 105 passengers and crew.ALMIRANTE, accessed 20 January 2011  Later service and fate  In May 1919, Hisko was detached from the Naval Overseas Transportation Service to support the Transatlantic Flying Expedition, in which the U.S. Navy flying boat NC-4 made the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by an American aircraft. Hisko was one of the tankers that supplied fuel to the three flying boats and to the destroyers involved in this historic operation. Hisko returned to New York from her final overseas trip in U.S. Navy service on 28 September 1919. She decommissioned there on 1 October 1919 and was returned to the United States Shipping Board. As SS Hisko, she entered commercial service and was renamed SS Beta in 1925. She was scrapped at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1948.

A similar program is run in the UK by the metropolitan police in partnership with the Great British Teddy bear company who have together created a range of police teddy bears that are given to children at the scene of incidents.

The website provides accurate historical and contemporary information about the Internal Revenue Service laws and changes regarding car donations. In the early years of its formation it was found that many donors wished to assist the charity but could not benefit by a tax deduction and so the recycling program was launched in order to always give something back to those that contributed in any way to the Teddy Bear Cops Program.

Ant followers are birds that feed by following swarms of army ants and take prey flushed by those ants. The best-known ant-followers are 18 species of antbird in the family Thamnophilidae, but other families of birds may follow ants, including thrushes, chats, ant-tanagers, cuckoos, motmots, and woodcreepers. Ant followers may be obligate, meaning that they derive most of their diet by following ant swarms, or non-obligate, meaning they derive only some of their diet from this behaviour. Some species may feed extensively at ant swarms yet may not be obligate ant followers, being able to and regularly feeding away from the swarms as well. Many species of tropical ants form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often nocturnal or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the Neotropical species Eciton burchellii, which is both diurnal and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies in various parts of E. burchellii's range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of \\"ant followers\\". Because E. burchellii is the only regular diurnal army ant specialised and regular ant- followers mostly occur in its Neotropical range, but Afrotropical birds do follow driver ants in the genus Dorylus. It was once suggested that the relationship between the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. Despite the easier availability of prey, ant followers face an element of risk, as these small birds can be killed by four stings from fire ants.Ant Army Invasion! – Wild South America – BBC.

It serves the people of Ashtabula County and the surrounding areas in Northeastern Ohio and Northwestern Pennsylvania. ACMC, an affiliate of Cleveland Clinichttp://my.clevelandclinic.org/default.aspx is a 234-licensed bed hospital with over 115 years of caring for the residents of Northeastern Ohio. ACMC’s history is rooted in community needs and support. Built in 1904 to deliver care to railroad workers, Ashtabula County Medical Center has evolved from a one-room wood framed building into the county’s only full-service hospital. The hospital operates the county's only cardiac catheterization lab and behavioral medicine unit, in addition to a sleep disorders lab, as well as many specialized services. The Ashtabula Clinic is a multi-speciality group physician practice connected to the hospital. History The Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster on December 29, 1876 was one of the greatest train disasters in American history. The Pacific Express number 5 was traveling through Ashtabula, heading west, during a heavy snowstorm. The iron bridge that carried trains over the “gulf”, a gorge formed by the Ashtabula River, fractured in the center and the eleven cars and 159 passengers plunged seventy feet to the bottom of the gorge. There was no hospital in the county at the time. Residents soon realized that there could be future disasters, as well as other illnesses and injuries in the community – and that a local hospital was needed. The first hospital in Ashtabula was built just a few hundred yards from the bridge that failed the night of the train disaster. Ashtabula General Hospital's first board of trustees ACMC began as a small emergency hospital used to care for injured railroad workers at the end of 19th century. In 1882, the Ladies Railroad Auxiliary was formed to care for the patients in this temporary hospital. In 1892, the Ladies Hospital League was organized and provided the impetus to establish a proper hospital for the people of Ashtabula. The diligent work of the league was rewarded on Feb. 12, 1902, with the organization of the Ashtabula General Hospital Association. This nonprofit corporation raised $22,538 and, on June 20, 1904, Ashtabula General Hospital opened. Shortly after the Ashtabula General Hospital opened in 1904, young women enters its nursing-training school. With the increase in the number enrolling by the 1920s, the Amelia E.Lewis Nurses' Home (currently known as the Lewis Building) opened on February 27, 1930. The Amelia Lewis Nurses Home erected in 1930, currently used for office building (Lewis Building) In 1952, a new 150-bed hospital opened. A new wing, built in 1963, brought the hospital up to 226 beds. In 1975, the city celebrated the opening of a new two-story south wing. The new Ashtabula General Hospital dedicated on March 21, 1952In 1983, the corporate structure of Ashtabula General Hospital was reorganized, resulting in the establishment of a not-for-profit parent corporation known as Ashtabula Community Health Services. The hospital became a parent-subsidiary structure, changing its name to the Ashtabula County Medical Center. In 1987, the ACMC Foundation, a program designed to help the hospital meet the challenges of the changing conditions in the health care arena, was initiated. The foundation committee members chose services that were not previously available anywhere else in the county as their campaign projects. Those projects have included the Emergency Department’s Fast Track area, a new Behavioral Medicine Unit, renovations of the Maternity Suite and the cardiac catheterization lab. In December 2008, ACMC invested $3.5 million to bring the gold standard of diagnosing heart disease – cardiac catheterization – to the community by building the Cleveland Clinic Cardiac Catheterization Lab at ACMC - the first Cardiac Catheterization Lab (commonly known as the Cath Lab) in Ashtabula County. ACMC provides OB/GYN care and maternity/birthing services in a newly renovated maternity unit. Affiliation In 1994, Ashtabula County Medical Center affiliated with the renowned Cleveland Clinic to provide anesthesia, radiology, pathology and pain management services. Later that year, ACMC acquired Glenbeigh to ensure alcohol and chemical dependency programs would remain in the county. In 1999, ACMC became an affiliate of the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS). Since 2001, the President and CEO of Ashtabula County Medical Center, as well as several key executives, became employed by Cleveland Clinic and have dual accountability to the ACMC Board of Trustees and to Cleveland Clinic leadership. ACMC merged with The Ashtabula Clinic, a multi-specialty physician practice, in 1995, establishing an integrated physician-hospital delivery system in the county. Reputation ACMC is the only full-service hospital in Ashtabula County. The hospital discharges just under 7,000 patients, performs approximately 8,000 inpatient and outpatient surgeries, treats over 35,000 people in the Emergency Department, conducts over 65,000 diagnostic tests and delivers approximately 400 babies each year.

The song became Spellman's only hit record, peaking at number 28 on the Billboard R&B; chart and number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. The flip side of the single was \\"Fortune Teller\\", made famous by The Rolling Stones cover among others.

And then he would go around - he would gig - based on [the fact that] he sang the low part on \\"Mother-In-Law.\\" And he encouraged me...with much force, to write him a song that he could use that concept.

The church was built in 1915-1917 by a Swedish Lutheran congregation to serve neighborhood families and university students. It was designed by Chapman and Magney and built in the Gothic Revival style. The congregation was organized in Minneapolis in 1903 by the Swedish immigrant-dominated Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church. At the time, Minnesota boasted a large population of Swedish immigrants. In 1905, the state had 126,000 Swedes, of whom 38,000 lived in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. In Minneapolis, there was a concentration of Swedish settlers in the Seven Corners neighborhood, around Washington and Cedar Avenues, on the west bank of the Mississippi River. Grace Church was organized as one of the first English-speaking congregations of the Augustana Synod in Minneapolis. In 1914, the congregation merged with Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Sharon Church of Minneapolis, located on the east bank of the Mississippi. The two congregations, now united under the name Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church, decided to sell their individual properties and build a common church near the University of Minnesota and Minnesota College, a school run by the synod. Minnesota College donated land at the corner of Harvard and Delaware Streets, and the church retained the firm of Chapman and Magney to design their new building. The firm was also responsible for designing the Sumner Community Library in 1915 and the Saxe Movie Theater, later the Forum Cafeteria, in 1914. The design was well-received, and construction of the new church building began in late 1915. The first service was held on December 24, 1916, in the basement of the partially completed building. Construction was finished in late 1917, and the church was dedicated on December 9, 1917. However, the congregation had run short on funds for furnishing the interior, so some temporary lighting fixtures and seating were used until the congregation could afford permanent furnishings. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln won re-election to a second term in office, while President George W. Bush carried the state with almost the same margin of victory. As of , this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from Arkansas. Background Incumbent Democrat Blanche Lincoln ran for re-election. Lincoln won re-election over Republican State Senator Jim Holt while President George W. Bush carried the state with almost the same margin of victory. The Democratic Party held super-majority status in the Arkansas General Assembly. A majority of local and statewide offices were also held by Democrats. This was rare in the modern South, where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential election—native son Bill Clinton—while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for John McCain in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. (The others being Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and West Virginia.)http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Election- state-04-08.png Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton's failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters (Clinton, however, herself lost the state by an even greater margin as the Democratic nominee in 2016). Democrats had an overwhelming majority of registered voters, the Democratic Party of Arkansas is more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives were members of the Blue Dog Coalition, which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent.

At the age of 34, he was the youngest member of the Senate. From February 2006 until January 2009 he held the position of national chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. Brazeau was expelled from the Conservative caucus following his February 7, 2013 arrest for domestic assault and sexual assault. Brazeau worked as day manager of an Ottawa strip club called the BareFax while suspended from the Senate. On September 15, 2015, Brazeau pleaded guilty to simple assault and cocaine possession as part of a plea deal in which other assault charges were dropped, and he was acquitted of sexual assault. On October 28, 2015, he was granted an absolute discharge by Quebec Court Judge Valmont Beaulieu; hence, he was not incarcerated and will avoid having a criminal record. However, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that \\"Brazeau [remained] suspended from the upper chamber, and his salary is being clawed back to repay nearly $50,000 in disallowed housing expense claims.\\" Brazeau returned to his seat in the Senate in September 2016 after charges of fraud and breach of trust related to his expense claims were withdrawn by the Crown. Life and career Brazeau is an Algonquin from the Kitigan Zibi reserve near Maniwaki. He worked at , a Royal Canadian Naval Reserve unit based in Ottawa that operates under the Canadian Forces Maritime Command. Brazeau earned a Quebec Diploma of College Studies in social sciences from CEGEP Heritage College (Gatineau) and studied, but dropped out of, civil law at the University of Ottawa. Fluent in both official Canadian languages, English and French, Brazeau's language preference is French. Brazeau joined the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) in 2001 and was elected vice-chief in April 2005. He acted as national chief from February 2006 until his election later in November of the same year. He is a member of CAP's affiliate, Alliance Autochtone du Quebec Inc. also known as the Native Alliance of Quebec, or the AAQ or NAQ.Congress of Aboriginal Peoples Brazeau pursued a very vocal strategy to obtain repeal of Section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act as his CAP vision. His position was that Section 67 impeded the individual human rights of aboriginals by its insistence that communal Indian Act rights superseded the CHRA. In this position he was supported by editorials of the National Post and the Globe and Mail. Brazeau endorsed passage of Bill C-21 as a step toward reform of Aboriginal governance, suggesting on 20 June 2008 that the extension of human rights protection “will ultimately lead to the dismantling of the Indian Act.” On December 22, 2008, Brazeau was appointed to the Senate on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He was sworn in as a senator on January 8, 2009. On March 31, 2012, Brazeau lost in a celebrity boxing match to Liberal MP (and future Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau. Brazeau has stated that he would like a rematch with Trudeau but Trudeau declined to participate in another boxing match. On May 30, 2015, Brazeau acted as a guest referee at a Great North Wrestling event at the Earl Armstrong Arena in Ottawa. Brazeau ended up getting bodyslammed through a table during the course of the match. In the early hours of January 19, 2016, Brazeau was admitted to hospital in critical but stable condition after he was found seriously injured in his home. The Quebec provincial police issued a statement indicating Brazeau's injuries did not appear related to criminal activity, and the Hull hospital released a statement saying his injuries were treated by successful surgery and were not considered life-threatening. On February 24, 2016, reports came out that Brazeau was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt in his house. Controversy =Two salaries= Brazeau was criticized for stating his intention to accept a seat in the Senate and concurrently remain national chief of the CAP thus collecting two publicly funded six-figure salaries; a decision from which he subsequently retreated by resigning as CAP chief. He has also come under fire over a sexual harassment complaint made against him to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario and for allegedly condoning heavy drinking during business hours. Brazeau resigned from his position of national chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples on January 9, 2009, issuing the following statement on the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples' website: =Use of CAP funds= In addition, he has faced allegations regarding the spending of funds received by the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples for aboriginal health programs. The Globe and Mail reported on January 19, 2009, that Health Canada auditors rejected almost $260,000 in congress expenses out of a budget of $472,900 allocated to the congress by the ministry, alleging that much of the money had been spent on board meetings where health issues were not discussed. Conservative Party spokesman Kory Teneycke indicated that the alleged misspending occurred before Brazeau became chief of the organization, and that Brazeau took steps to address the problem once he took over the leadership. =Senate attendance record= On June 26, 2012, Brazeau came under fire after attacking Canadian Press journalist Jennifer Ditchburn via his official Twitter account. Brazeau publicly called Ditchburn a \\"bitch\\" after she reported on his poor Senate attendance record. Brazeau did in fact have poor attendance on the Senate floor: the Senate attendance register showed that he was absent for 25% of the Senate's 72 sittings between June 2011 and April 2012. He was also absent for 31% of the meetings of the human rights committee, where he is deputy-chair, and for 65% of meetings at the Senate Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, on which he sits. = Residency controversy = Without the knowledge of his ex-wife's father, Brazeau used Daryl Tenasco's address at Kitigan Zibi, Quebec, for the purpose obtaining an aboriginal income tax exemption from 2004 to 2008. Kitigan Zibi Chief Gilbert Whiteduck said: “Normally you have income tax exemption when you live on a reserve and you are employed by a reserve.” Neighbours said it did not appear that Brazeau lived in the community. According to Jean Guy Whiteduck “I’ve never seen him, it’s right across from my place. I’ve never seen him there. He may have visited. That’s about it.\\" On February 28, 2013, the Senate committee of Internal Economy announced that Brazeau, along with fellow senators Pamela Wallin, Mike Duffy, and Mac Harb, would be subject to a forensic audit to determine appropriateness of their expense claims. Deloitte accountants Timm and Stewart conducted an independent audit and came to the conclusion that Brazeau had made no false claims and reached no conclusions as to whether he met the Senate’s definition of primary residence because there was none. The audit document can be found in Senate papers dated 7 May 2013 and can be said to be an indictment of vague (to the point of meaningless) policies: > 2.1.2. There is a lack of clarity in the terminology used for the different > residences mentioned or discussed in the applicable regulations and > guidelines. The following terms are used without being clearly defined: > primary residence, secondary residence, NCR residence, provincial residence. > In addition, the term registered residence is not defined. 2.1.3. The > regulations and guidelines applicable during the period of our examination > do not include criteria for determining “primary residence”. As such, we are > not able to assess the status of the primary residence declared by Senator > Brazeau against existing regulations and guidelines. Undeterred by the conclusions of Deloitte, the Senate's Subcommittee on Living Allowances, chaired by Senator Elizabeth Marshall with Senators Comeau and Campbell, then ignored selected parts of the Deloitte audit and wrote their own conclusions for the Internal Economy committee, who then recommended on 9 May to the entire Senate, after several secret sessions, that he be ordered to reimburse a minimum of $51,482 in expense money. \\"Liberal Senator Mac Harb and Independent Senator Patrick Brazeau must immediately repay inappropriately claimed expenses or the Senate will seize the funds,\\" said Marjory LeBreton, the then-current Leader of the Government in the Senate. A spokeswoman from LeBreton's office said Brazeau's pay may be withheld as a means of recovering the funds. Brazeau challenged the internal economy committee's order. On August 1, 2013, in an affidavit filed in an Ottawa court, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police alleged that Brazeau inappropriately claimed his father’s home in Maniwaki as his primary residence in order to claim a $22,000 a year taxpayer funded housing allowance. The affidavit said that Brazeau actually resided in a rented Gatineau home right across the Ottawa river from his workplace, while claiming the housing allowance for living in Maniwaki. CTV news employee Robert Fife reported that the RCMP investigation revealed that Brazeau was being investigated for breach of trust. Brazeau later singled out Fife in his Senate farewell speech on 4 November 2013. =Chief Theresa Spence= Brazeau was criticized for mocking Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence at a Conservative fundraiser in an Ottawa suburb on 29 January 2013. In an audio recording from the event provided to CTV News by Metroland Media, Brazeau is heard stating publicly \\"Oh, poor Theresa Spence. Oh, poor her,\\" in regards to the six-week-long hunger strike that the aboriginal leader had recently ended. The hunger strike was aimed to force a meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Governor General of Canada David Johnston to discuss aboriginal treaty rights and socioeconomic issues. Brazeau was also critical of the Idle No More movement, saying that he felt many Canadian aboriginals simply expected to be supported by taxpayers. The recording also revealed Brazeau stating \\"To sit back, wait for the government to give me handouts. Maybe be on welfare, maybe drink, maybe take up drugs\\", in regards to aboriginal Canadians. He later returned to the subject of dismantling the Indian Act when he added \\"The best way to get our land back is to buy it back. Just like every other Canadian.\\" Brazeau also insinuated in the recording that Spence had actually gained weight during her \\"so-called hunger strike\\". =Legal troubles and suspension from Senate= On February 7, 2013, scarcely nine days after the Spence incident, Brazeau was arrested for an incident relating to domestic violence. He was charged with assault and sexual assault in Gatineau court house the next day. After a short court appearance Brazeau was released on $1000 bail on the condition he not go within 150 metres of the victim's work or home. Government Senate Leader Marjory LeBreton later announced that, pending a resolution to Brazeau's legal situation, the Senator will be removed from the Conservative caucus and barred from taking his seat, although the Senator will still be paid his full salary. April 10, 2014, the day before a trial was to be set, police allege that he was intoxicated and got into an altercation with a woman. They arrested him on new charges of assault, cocaine possession, uttering threats and breach of bail conditions. He has pleaded not guilty. In October 13, 2014, Brazeau was charged with intoxicated driving. An officer investigated an unconscious Brazeau as he parked and was seated behind the steering wheel and he detected a strong scent of liquor. Brazeau tested for .16 BAC at the police station. He is officially charged with:violating bail conditions and intoxicated driving. A knife was found in his vehicle, and he was charged with weapons possession violating bail conditions. Brazeau was court ordered to two months of detox rehabilitation as he awaits trial. On September 15, 2015, Brazeau pleaded guilty to simple assault and possessing cocaine as part of a plea bargain in which he was acquitted of sexual assault. The simple assault plea was connected to the February 2013 assault, and the cocaine possession plea was connected to the April 2014, for which the assault charges were dropped after the plea deal. The October 2014 impaired driving charges are still outstanding as of the guilty plea. On October 28, 2015, he was granted an unconditional discharge by the Quebec Court but will remain suspended from the Senate. However, he still faces a criminal trial for fraud and breach of trust arising from his Senate expenses, scheduled to take place in March 2016, according to the Globe and Mail. =Suspension from and return to Senate= Since Brazeau was facing charges of assault and sexual assault, the Senate voted to suspend him on 12 February 2013. The motion stated that \\"in order to protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate and public trust and confidence in Parliament, the Senate order a leave of absence for the Honourable Senator Brazeau to last until this order is rescinded\\". On 5 November 2013, the Senate voted to suspend Brazeau, along with fellow Senators Mike Duffy and Pamela Wallin, for the remainder of the session, likely until the next federal election in 2015. The Senate also cut their salaries and use of office resources. The specific motion to suspend Brazeau without pay was voted on as follows: 50 yeas, 29 nays, and 13 abstentions. It marked the first time in Senate history that a senator had been sanctioned over expenses without being convicted of a criminal offence. With the early election call by Prime Minister Harper on August 2, 2015, Senators Brazeau, Duffy and Wallen recommenced receiving their salaries and benefits. Brazeau returned to his seat in the Senate in September 2016 after charges of fraud and breach of trust related to his expense claims were withdrawn by the Crown. =Work outside the Senate= Denied his salary as a Senator and without other means of support, Brazeau embarked on a very public search for employment following his suspension, resorting to soliciting work via Twitter. In December 2013, Brazeau was hired as a freelance reporter for the Halifax edition of the satirical magazine Frank but was fired after writing one column. In January 2014, Brazeau wrote a column for the political website Loonie Politics where he outlines his argument why Prime Minister Stephen Harper is not serious about senate reform. Brazeau was hired as day manager of an Ottawa strip club known as the Bare Fax in February 2014.\\"Suspended senator Patrick Brazeau lands new job at Ottawa strip club\\". CTV News, February 19, 2014. \\"A job is a job\\", he was quoted by an Ottawa reporter as saying in regards to his new occupation. As day manager he is in charge of 25-30 staff members, including everything from hiring and firing to scheduling. Brazeau had also expressed interest in writing a book or starring in a reality show as means of earning an income, prior to his suspension being lifted. In the recent news: Brazeau was mentioned in the Rolling Stone's article \\"Why Can't He Be Our President?\\" quoting current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \\"I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint,\\" Mr. Trudeau says in the article. \\"I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.

Richard (Riccardo) Filangieri (c.1195-1254/63) was an Italian nobleman who played an important part in the Sixth Crusade in 1228-9 and in the War of the Lombards from 1229-43, where he was in charge of the forces of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, battling forces on the other side, local barons first led by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut. During the first half of Filangieri's career he was a Ghibelline, but during the second a Guelph. He was a member of the Filangieri family of Campania. Rise to influence in Italy He was the eldest son of Giordano I, lord of Nocera, and Oranpiassa. His younger brothers were Giordano II, Lothair, and Henry. He was educated as a knight and married Iacoba, daughter of Pietro Cottone, who had been made count of Lettere and castellan of Gragnano in 1198 by Queen Constance. By his marriage to Iacoba, Richard entered the ranks of the Neapolitan nobility, a traditional caste which had not been much open to Italo-Normans like the Filangieri.\\"Filangieri, Riccardo,\\" Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, 47 (Rome: Società Grafica Romana, 1997), 590-95. Richard was made imperialis marescalcus (imperial marshal) of the Kingdom of Sicily by the Emperor Frederick II. He held this title as early as 1224, but in most documents thereafter until he lost the post to Tebaldo Francesco (before June 1243, probably 1242) he is titled imperialis aule marescalcus. In 1231 his brother Giordano was appointed to act as marshal in Richard's absence; Richard was then appointed Marshal of Jerusalem. In 1225 Richard joined the court of the emperor at Palermo. In 1226-27 he followed the imperial court around northern Italy: from Rimini, to Parma, to Borgo San Donnino, and then back to the Capitanate. From February to May 1227 he was in Sicily, at the emperor's side in Catania and Palermo again. Command in the Crusader states =Sixth Crusade and the first phase of the Lombard war= In April 1227, as part of the Sixth Crusade, Richard left for Acre with 500 knights, mostly Lombards, to augment the 800 already in the Holy Land under the Duke of Limburg, Henry IV.Christopher Tyerman (2006), God's War: A New History of the Crusades (London: Penguin Books), 747. Richard met Frederick in the harbour of Limassol in Cyprus on 21 July 1228. Richard, Odo of Montbéliard, and Hermann von Salza were the commanders of Frederick's Crusade, since none of them were excommunicate (the emperor was).Thomas C. Van Cleve (1969), \\"The Crusade of Frederick II,\\" The Later Crusades, 1189-1311, R. L. Wolff and H. W. Hazard, edd., A History of the Crusades, vol. II, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press), 450-52. Filangieri was privy to Frederick's prior negotiations with al-Kāmil, the Sultan of Egypt, for the return of Jerusalem, the Holy City. It is for this reason that he punished a group of knights in the spring of 1228 for raiding Muslim territory and returned their booty. Filangieri also rode out nightly to meet secretly with envoys from al-Kāmil, which led some fellow Crusaders to write a complaint to Pope Gregory IX over Frederick's \\"evil\\" agents.Mary Nickerson Hardwicke (1969), \\"The Crusader States, 1192-1243,\\" Later Crusades, 1189-1311, R. L. Wolff and H. W. Hazard, edd., A History of the Crusades, vol. II, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press), 543. Richard was sent back in the fall of 1231 as imperial legate, again with a large army of mostly Lombards. When the War of the Lombards heated up over the interference of Frederick II in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, it was Richard who represented the emperor and commanded the imperial troops. He was allied with the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller. Richard was appointed as bailie to exercise the regency on behalf of Frederick, whose son Conrad II was king. His rights were generally recognised but his personal authority was much circumscribed by the Assizes and the Haute Cour. He made his headquarters at Tyre and he also held Jerusalem.A summary description of the War can be found in Tyerman, 725-6. The city walls of Nicosia, which Filangieri fell back on after his defeat at Agridi in June 1232. He later abandoned the city and retreated to Kyrenia. =War of the Lombards= Frederick had initially attempted to take Cyprus by treachery, forcing the then regent, John of Ibelin, to hand over the regency of the boy king Henry I of Cyprus. However, when Frederick left the island, John reasserted control, and drove off the Imperial forces that attempted to re-take the island. Frederick then sent a fleet, under the command of Richard Filangieri, to the mainland, besieging John's center of power in Beirut.Christopher Marshall (1992), Warfare in the Latin East, 1192-1291 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 38-9. The lower city surrendered under its bishop, Galeran. While the army under his brother Lothair was besieging the citadel, Richard himself went ahead and accepted the submission of Tyre, which he placed under the control of his brother Henry.Hardwicke, 548. Before the citadel fell the Haute Courto which Richard had recently presented himself as Frederick's bailieobjected to the siege because the laws of the kingdom forbade the sovereign from declaring the forfeiture of a fief without the Cour's consent, which Frederick had not sought before Filangieri assaulted Beirut. Richard ignored their concerns and, after an embassy to Frederick in Italy failed to reverse his policy, the citadel fell. Richard had shown himself beholden to none but Frederick, and this convinced the moderate party that had been instrumental in the truce of 1228 to align themselves with the Ibelines.Hardwicke, 549. The war was thus reignited. In May 1232, in the first major battle of the war, Casal Imbert, Richard defeated his enemies, the House of Ibelin.Tyerman, 726. In June, however, his men were so soundly defeated by an inferior force at the Battle of Agridi in Cyprus that his support on the island evaporated. In 1233 Filangieri sought the alliance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, and Hethum II of Armenia, but to no avail. He requested reinforcements from Frederick, but received none. By then only Tyre remained in imperialist control, though Acre was also nominally imperial under Odo of Montbéliard, who had received half of the divided bailiwick from Frederick in 1236.According to Jean Richard (1985), \\"The Political and Ecclesiastical Organization of the Crusader States,\\" The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East, N. P. Zacour and H. W. Hazard, ed. A History of the Crusades, vol. V (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press), 205, this division of the bailiwick between Acre and Tyre was proposed to Frederick by the Pope. In Les Gestes des Chiprois, Frederick contemplates sending a bailie to Acre and Richart Philangier fust a Sur (Syria) as early as 1233. Odo also had the support of the Haute Cour. In 1239-40 he was unable to establish contact with the Crusade of Theobald I of Navarre. In 1241 the Hospitallers in Acre were besieged in their fortress by the Templars, who had the support of the commune. A faction of Hospitallers then allied with a faction of the bourgeoisie and conspired with Filangieri to hand the city over to his troops while the Ibelins were away.Hans Eberhard Mayer (1978), \\"Ibelin versus Ibelin: The Struggle for the Regency of Jerusalem 1253-1258,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 122(1), 29. Filangieri entered the city in disguise but he and the plot were uncovered. Though escaping with his life, he was recalled to Italy by the emperor. Lothair was left in charge in Tyre.Hardwicke, 553. The Guelphs in Acre meanwhile had sent a request to Frederick to have Richard replaced as bailie by a man of their choosing: Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester.Richard, 205. In 1242 or 1243 Conrad declared his own majority and on 5 June the absentee monarch's regency was granted by the Haute Court to Alice, widow of Hugh I of Cyprus and daughter of Isabella I of Jerusalem. Alice promptly began ruling as if queen, ignoring Conrad, who was in Italy, and ordering Richard arrested. He was shipwrecked and captured while trying to return from Italy to Tyre, leaving his brother Lothair to defend the besieged place. The city fell on 12 June, and the Ibelins seized the citadel on 7 or 10 July, with the help of Alice, whose forces arrived on 15 June. First exile from Italy and return Because of Richard's capture and Lothair's surrender, the entire Filangieri family fell into disgrace. Richard was eventually released and returned to Sicily, where he and his brother Henry, with Henry's son Giovanni di Sorrento, were imprisoned in Apulia by the emperor (1242/3). In his Chronicle, the south Italian Richard of San Germano records that Raymond VII of Toulouse met the emperor at Melfi in September 1242 and intervened on behalf of the defeated Filangieri.David Jacoby (1986), \\"The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Collapse of Hohenstaufen Power in the Levant\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 40:83-101, 86. Frederick allowed Richard and his brothers to accompany the count back to Toulouse (1244).H. J. Pybus (1930), \\"The Emperor Frederick II and the Sicilian Church,\\" Cambridge Historical Journal, 3(2), 149-50. It is possible that Frederick's treatment of Richard and Lothair pushed another brother, Marinus Filangieri, the Archbishop of Bari, out of the imperial and into the Papal camp in the struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines. It was Marinus who had enlisted the aid of Raymond in securing the release of his brothers. Richard is recorded with Raymond in southern France in 1249, once at Toulouse and again at Milhaud. In September he was a witness to Raymond's will and attached his signature to it. In 1251, after the death of Frederick in 1250, he returned to Italy. He joined the rebellion of Naples, Capua, and the rest of Campania against Conrad, who was now also King of Sicily. In July he was elected podestà of the commune of Naples, a post in which he is recorded in documents dated between 1 November 1251 and 7 October 1252. On 5 November his successor, Gallo de Orbelli, was in office (until 1253). With his experience, however, Richard was the leader of the defence of Naples for eight months while Conrad besieged it. Forced to surrender, he was exiled a second time. Second exile and return The castle at Castellammare, a hereditary lordship held by Richard jure uxoris (in right of his wife) in the Campania. From 1253 to 1254 Richard, through the intervention of Pope Innocent IV, was lodged at Ariccia with his nephew Henry, Archbishop-elect of Bari. Richard and Galvano Lancia, another leading nobleman of Sicily, organised a congress of Sicilian nobles at Anagni that year, where they recognised the Pope as their overlord. In October 1254 Innocent confirmed Richard in the barony of the Terra di Lavoro, which Frederick had previously conferred on him; in the county of Lettere and the castle of Gragnano, to which he had a claim through his wife; and in the lordships of Calvi, Castellammare, and Scafati. Richard also held Satriano as regent for his nephew Richard and Riardo as regent for another nephew, Roger. There is a Ricardus Filangieri recorded under \\"3 November\\" in the necrology of Santa Patrizia in Naples, but whether it is this Richard or one of the numerous other Richards of the Filangieri clan is undeciphered. From February 1262 at Lettere a document reads curia nobilis viri domini Riccardi Filangerii, but this is probably a reference to Richard's eponymous son, Richard Filangieri II, sometimes called iunior. By his wife Iacoba, who died in 1271, Richard left one daughter, Isabella, who married Giacomo d'Aquino, lord of Arienzo and Galluccio. Richard was definitely dead by March 1263.

Its primary product is a flexible CIGS solar cell on a plastic substrate.  Technology  Ascent Solar's thin-film solar modules are manufactured from CIGS cells using copper indium gallium (di)selenide semiconductor (CIGS), which has shown a 10.5% NREL efficiency in real-world conditions. What makes this proprietary technology unique, however, is its relative size, weight and flexibility: Ascent's CIGS panels currently allow for 85 watts/meter, and 48 watts/kg, thereby giving them the greatest power density and weight ratio among available flexible photovoltaic products by a significant margin. This allows for the efficient use of solar power in a range of new contexts, in which size or weight restrictions have previously rendered solar power impracticable: e.g., cell phones, airplanes, unmanned vehicles, consumer electronics, railways, space programs, and off-grid applications. This developing technology was selected as one of the 100 Most Innovative Technologies for 2010 by R&D; Magazine, and as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2011 by Time Magazine.  Market history  Ascent Solar entered the manufacturing stage for its products in 2013, in part by teaming up with a range of other companies like TFG Radiant (for integrating these materials into a range of building and construction materials), Foxconn (for a \\"pilot project\\" at the Zhengzhou Factory, which is currently manufacturing the iPhone 5), and Bye Aerospace (for solar-powered unmanned aircraft).

EnerPlex  EnerPlex is a brand of solar and electronic consumer products launched by Ascent Solar, Inc. Unlike traditional glass backed panels, the panels integrated into all EnerPlex products are monolithically integrated on plastic (not glass) substrate.  Corporate history  Ascent Solar was founded in 2005 by ITN Energy Systems, a company engaged in commercializing emerging energy technologies through spin-offs and joint ventures. During the first few years of operation, its primary focus was to research the CIGS thin-film technology as well as researching efficient methods for manufacturing. On July 18, 2006, Ascent completed its IPO, releasing 3,000,000 shares at 5.50 USD per share. In June 2007, Norsk Hydro ASA, a Norwegian based supplier of aluminum products, entered into a deal with Ascent whereby it purchased 23% of Ascent shares with the option to increase that stake to up to 35%, which it did on October 7, 2008. On September 22, 2008, Ascent's then CEO, Matthew Foster, stepped down from his position. His reason for doing so was cited as an agreement between him and the company as the company changed from research-driven to production-driven. He will remain with Ascent as a consultant for an additional year after his retirement date. On March 11, 2009, Ascent Solar commenced regular production at their facility in Colorado.

Most of the Granite area of Chesterfield County was annexed by the independent city of Richmond on January 1, 1970. A community in the stone industry According to documents on file at the Library of Virginia, in April 1872, notice was published in Petersburg that Mathew Hall had been appointed postmaster of a new U.S. Post Office at Granite.http://www.lva.lib.va.us/ Granite was named for the granite rock formations which underlie the rapids of the river at the geological fall line which begin downstream from the current Williams Island Dam. Mining this granite was the basis for quarries which were located on both sides of the river in the vicinity. Granite stone quarried nearby was used to construct the State, War and Navy building in Washington, D.C., and to build the 3-foot granite walls of Richmond's Gothic City Hall at 10th and Capitol Streets which was completed in 1894. (It became known as \\"Old City Hall\\" when replaced in 1972 with a new structure). However, some quarrying operations had already been active in the area since the early 18th century. Quarries and companies which operated near Granite were listed in Mineral Resources of Virginia by Thomas Leonard Watson, Ray Smith Bassler, Heinrich Ries, and Roy Jay, published in 1907 as: *Granite Development Company Quarry *Hawkins Quarry *Krim Quarries *McIntosh Quarries *Middendorf Quarries *Netherwood Quarries *Old Dominion Granite Company's quarries At that time (1907), Granite Station was located on the Southern Railway (successor to the Richmond and Danville Railroad) and the McIntosh Quarry had a spur track. The McIntosh Quarry furnished the stone used in the approaches and steps in the renovation and expansion of the Virginia State Capitol which had recently been completed (1904–06). Suburban growth reaches Granite Manchester merged with Richmond in 1910 and the combined city grew rapidly. Soon Granite was not a remote place. As the land around the Granite area was developed with new streets and housing after World War II, Granite lost its separate identity as suburban growth overtook it. A portion of modern-day Forest Hill Avenue was earlier named Granite Road, and extended from Westover Hills into Chesterfield County, ending at Bon Air. Most of the Granite area of Chesterfield County was annexed by the independent city of Richmond on January 1, 1970. The neighborhoods in the city in the area of Granite include Granite Acres and Willow Oaks. Nearby, Netherwood Drive was named for the former quarry at its western end.

At the forefront of this ministry for 130 years has been the Brisbane City Temple Band (or Temple Band). Having toured nationally and internationally as well as performing on ABC Radio, the Temple Band has served its corps, community and city well. Purpose As well as aiding worship during Sunday meetings the band plays at Civic functions, hospitals, nursing homes and retirement centres. By arrangement with the Brisbane City Council the Temple Band makes a musical contribution to the city's community life with regular recitals in Brisbane public gardens and parks. In the past the Temple Band has performed at regular engagements with the Australian Broadcasting Commission for nationwide broadcasts and television performances. A feature of the band's activities that has stood the test of time is the Sunday evening open-air meeting in the Queen Street Mall to which a large crowd is regularly attracted. Bandmaster lineage Although the Temple Band has a history that reaches back over 100 years, it has only served under the leadership of a handful of bandmasters (or B.M's) throughout its existence including, in the earlier years, B.M's Mick Berghoffer, Percy Gridley and Dave Waugh. Leonard Baxter was commissioned as a bandsman of the Temple Band in 1924 and took over the leadership of the band in 1932. B.M Baxter held this position for forty-four years, except for a period of war service when the band was in the capable hands of B.M H. Armitage. His deputy and principal cornetist for almost 20 years John Allen succeeded B/M Baxter in 1977. John had emigrated from UK in 1958 and had previously been the principal cornet of the Wood Green Citadel Band in North London. He was also a member of the Scots Guards Band for three years prior to emigrating to Australia. He resigned from the leadership of the Temple Band in 1985 and with his family moved to reside in Melbourne. The Temple Band under B.M Stuart Lang in 2007. B.M Malcolm Carter became Bandmaster after moving residence from Melbourne in 1986. When B.M Carter retired from his position in 1994, B.M Mark Everitt, who had been involved with the Temple band for 15 years, was then handed the baton. He stepped down from his role in 2000, and was replaced by accomplished composer Barrie Gott. Stuart Lang from Wollongong corps was bandmaster from 2007 to April 2014 and lead the band in tours to Sydney and New Zealand. In 2014 Barrie Gott returned to the podium to lead the band in the celebrations for the Brisbane City Temple's 130th celebrations, for both Sunday services and outreach, as well as a series of events including an Easter weekend with Majors Ron and Donna Millar (Canada), a commemorative concert for Salvationist composer Ray Steadman-Allen with the Brisbane Excelsior Band, and a concert series with musical theatre headliner Silvie Paladino with Melbourne Staff Bandmaster Ken Waterworth. Tim Green is the current bandmaster, having previously served as a percussionist, concert pianist and trombonist in the band. Commencing at the age of 23, he is the youngest to lead the band. Tim is also actively involved in barbershop and a cappella singing, with his quartet placing first in the Pan Pacific (Sydney, Australia) and third at the international convention (Las Vegas, NV, USA).http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/pitch-perfect-delivery-for- brisbane-barbershop-boys-20150701-gi2pe3.html Under his leadership, the band has conducted concerts with Silvie Paladino, The Idea of North, The Melbourne Staff Band and recently engaged in an innovative worship-culture project entitled Behold with the Factory 412 Worship Team.

This rule, however, has been relaxed in recent years, but under the premise that the individual is looking to be enrolled at some point in the immediate future.

It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the de facto alternative to fengshui. Huǒhēiàn translate as \\"fire and darkness\\" in English. This name refers to a passage from the Book of Burial of Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty: > Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness. Unlike fengshui, huǒhēiàn values diagonal and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and jade statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art). Early practitioners of the aesthetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations. However, like the dark motifs of Gothic architecture (believed by some to be a Western analogy of sorts), huǒhēiàn grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in Chinese history. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and excitement. The art of huǒhēiàn countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house. Additionally, huǒhēiàn enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical Chinese rock garden.

She holds a BA from Smith College, studied at the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program, and holds an MFA from the Milton Avery Graduate School for the Arts at Bard College. Hardy is a founding member of the queer feminist journal and artist collective LTTR, and has directed music videos for groups including Le Tigre, Lesbians on Ecstasy, and Men. Her work is included in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, and has been exhibited and performed internationally at venues including, MoMA PS1 (New York NY), Artists Space (New York, NY), The Tate Modern (London, UK) and Galerie Sonja Junkers (Munich, Germany) among many others. Hardy is most famous for fashion, but she also works through performance art, Video art and sculpture.  Early life and education  Hardy was born on October 27, 1977 in Fort Worth, Texas, and began spelling her name K8 as a teenager while working on, and publishing various zines. She attended Smith College, in Northampton, MA, where she studied film, alongside feminist and queer theory. Through the Five College Consorstium she studied video with Elisabeth Subrin. During this time, she received a grant to work with Miranda July and the Northwest Film Center in Portland, Oregon. Upon graduating from Smith College in 2000, Hardy moved to New York City and began working as a stylist for clients including Fischerspooner. In the following years, she studied at the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program, and in 2008 received an MFA from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College, in Annandale-on- Hudson, NY.  Selected works  = TV Lip Synch (2002) = Hardy collaborated with Wynne Greenwood in the making of TV Lip Synch, a video in which the two artists lip sync to various daytime-television clips including scenes from Oprah, a soap opera, and a Barbara Walters interview, all programs marketed towards women. = Beautiful Radiating Energy (2004) = Beautiful Radiating Energy is a performance piece in which Hardy, dressed all in white, makes gymnastic contortions in front of a projected video while shouting \\"I am happy; I am here; I am hurt. I'm ready!\\" in a variety of ranges that require a month of vocal training. The video projected includes images of Hardy's friend Math walking away from the camera, found footage of reactions to the burial of Baader-Meinhof terrorists, gay rights parades, and body building competitions. (Wang, 104) = New Report (2005–2007) = Hardy and Wynne Greenwood play \\"Henry Stein-Acker-Hill\\" and \\"Henry Irigaray\\", fictional news reporters for the fictional news station WKRH, whose tagline is \\"pregnant with information\\". Their names are references to feminist theorists Luce Irigaray, Edith Stein, Joan Acker and Patricia Hill Collins. As Wynne Greenwood sometimes works under the name Wynne Ryan, WKRH is an acronym for Wynne K8 Ryan Hardy. The two, clad in berets, trench coats, and turtlenecks, report on news such as bra burning and running water and interview a friend suffering from anxiety. The press release states, \\"If traditional activist video was invested in the communication of clear messages to a target audience, the work makes politics by making television speak differently as it addresses the emergent qualities of a community for whom visibility is less a goal than a means of dismantling dominant images... If the revolution will be televised today it is only by queering TV in order to encounter the desires of the subjects and histories it addresses.\\" In 2007, Hardy and Greenwood performed New Report Live at the Tate Modern in London. Their report focused on the multiple meanings of power and they dubbed the Tate the \\"structure of power\\". Other forms of power discussed were colonialism, slavery, capitalism, and the war in Iraq. \\"The artists invaded and occupied an iconic structure of power, symbolic of omnipresent patriarchal structures of power within the art world and society at large\\" (Dickinson, 5). = Bare Life (2007) = In this performance project with musician and sound artist Stefan Tcherepnin, the two respond to Giorgio Agamben's concept of \\"Bare Life\\" (White, 20). = Hair Zer Kunst (2009) = Begun in 2009, Hair Zer Kunst is the collective collaboration between K8 Hardy and NYC hairstylist, Shaun SureThing for Seagull Salon. Drawing from inspirations such as Vidal Sassoon structure, Bauhaus and Brutalist architecture, Hair Zer Kunst is a study in the movement of hair, the theoretical movements of architectural structure and the moments, un-captured, between the stillness of a haircut and its documentation. Revisited/revisited in 2016, Hair Zer Kunst seeks to strip down the conversation structure even further. The baseline for Hair Zer Kunst having been laid in 2009 seeks no other noise to join its chorus. Hair Zer Kunst is decidedly singular. Away from the male gaze by design but aligned, otherwise to nothing. In its current state, Hair Zer Kunst has no objective; No motive, no alliances and no opinions. It reflects the viewers own degree of cultural saturation and identity cooperation.

Ipnops are small, slender fish that live close to the ocean floor in the bathyal and abyssal zones. The genus is notable for its unusual eyes. Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Ipnops agassizii Garman, 1899 (grideye fish) * Ipnops meadi J. G. Nielsen, 1966 * Ipnops murrayi Günther, 1878 Distribution Specimens of I. murrayi and I. agassizi have been caught at depths of 1392–3475 m; I. murrayi occurs in the Atlantic Ocean while I. agassizi occurs in the Indo-Pacific region. I. meadi is also found in the Indo-Pacific, but occurs deeper at 3310–4970 m. Biology Ipnops has only recently been observed in the wild, so details of their life history has mostly been inferred from the characteristics of captured specimens. They have large mouths with numerous small teeth for swallowing large prey, as well as well-developed gill rakers for capturing smaller items. Examination of stomach contents show a diet of mostly crustaceans and polychaete worms. Their eyes are extremely modified into flat, cornea-like organs that cover most of the upper surface of the head. The purpose of these structures is debated—they are light-sensitive and may serve to detect bioluminescent prey; it has also been proposed that the organs themselves may be luminescent and act as lures. Ipnops have a well-developed lateral line, which has been suggested to have a primary sensory function given the degenerate state of their other senses. Like other bathypteroid fishes, Ipnops is hermaphroditic, with male and female gonads combined into a single organ. External fertilization is likely, possibly with ripe eggs held by the pelvic fins to facilitate fertilization. The capture of multiple specimens in single trawls suggests that these fishes may live in aggregates.

The term was used in the 1955 Hollywood film To Hell and Back, based on the best-selling autobiography of Audie Murphy, the most decorated U.S. soldier of World War II, and starring Murphy in the lead role. The film included a song, The Dogface Soldier, originally written in 1942 by two U.S. Army infantry soldiers, Ken Hart and Bert Gold.

It is located west of Stone Street (the B2068), the Roman road which today takes traffic between Canterbury and Lympne. Within the parish are the settlements of Bodsham, North Leigh and Evington. There are six elected members of the Parish Council. The parishes name, Elmsted, is formed of two words. Elm refers to the large number of Elm trees that grew there in Saxon times. The second part, sted, comes from the Saxon word stede meaning 'place'.  Geography  Elmsted is a small parish encompassing an area of approximately 10 km square with its population scattered in small hamlets like Bodsham, North Leigh and Elmsted Court. Settlements are largely at the top of the chalky down land with surrounding, lowland areas being used for grazing Cattle and Sheep and other farming . In these lower areas the ground contains far more in the way of clay and flint deposits than chalk. The Parish church of St James the Greater lies in the center of the parish at a kilometer or two from the parish boundary in every direction. On its eastern boundary the parish largely follows parallel to the Roman Road Stone Street. However it dips into the hamlets of Stelling Minnis and into Sixmile cottages. The parish itself is 11 kilometers east of Ashford which is the nearest town. The settlements in the parish are very scattered which can largely be attributed to the agricultural nature of the parish. Homesteads would be built next to the land that the people living in them farmed. The laborers on the farms would then walk to their parish church. The parish boundaries have remained broadly consistent with only slight variations in the south-east of the parish. Boundary map for the parish of Elmsted The parish contains no shops or doctors surgery but does have a primary school, a pub, a cidery and a number of bed-and-breakfasts. The local school is Bodsham Church of England Primary School. The School has around 90 students and has a close link to the local church with a daily worship. It is part of the Federation of Church of England Primary Schools.  History  The Roman road Stone Street defines part of the parish's eastern border. Constructed after the 43 AD invasion of the British Isles, the road was made to make travel from Canterbury to the south coast faster and more direct for movements of troops in the Empire. It also made trade for areas surrounding the road easier and later allowed the Archbishop of Canterbury to more easily monitor his diocese. Elmsted was not named in the Domesday book but Bodsham, one of the hamlets in the parish was noted. This Is where the local school is situated today. One of the more prominent families in the parish's history were the Honywoods who lived at Evington from the 1400s until the 1900s. Signs of this can be seen in St James the Great Church where the south chapel is known as the Honywood Chapel. John Marius Wilson, of the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales gave the following description of the parish between 1870 and 1872 > \\"ELMSTEAD, a parish in Elham district, Kent; 4½ miles ESE of Wye r. station, > and 6½ ENE of Ashford. It has a post office under Ashford, and a fair on 25 > July. Acres, 2, 692. Real property, £2, 692. Pop., 492. Houses, 93. The > property is divided among a few. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of > Canterbury. Value, £80. Patron, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is > old but good.\\" Today the church is still under the Archbishop of Canterbury and whilst the church is now older it remains in good condition. The fair on the 25th of July for St James day now no longer takes place, though a spring fair occurs May 1 in Evington Hall. The number of houses in elmsted has increased significantly in the last 110 years. As of the 2011 census there were 140 houses, an increase of 59 since 1901.  St James the Great  223x223pxThe Anglican church is dedicated to St James the Great and dates back to the 11th century. It was restored in 1877 by Ewan Christian. It was Grade I listed in 1966 due to its historic and architectural significance. The church has an unusual wooden medieval belfry on the towerBritish Listed Buildings retrieved 20 July 2013 which was constructed across the 13th and 14th centuries. There are 6 bells in the church which were cast in 1721 by John Waylet. Before this there were 4 bells in the belfry which were recorded in 1552. Much like other churches in the area its walls have been constructed with local flints. It is made up of a tower in the west, a nave with north and south aisles and a chancel with north and south chapels, all of which are open making the church open and airy. There are a number of large tablets inside the church which are all dedicated to prominent families in the parish like the Honywoods. The church hosts a 19th-century organ as well as kitchen facilities, a toilet and a vestry which is now used for Sunday school. Every second Sunday of the month a family service is held in the church. The two chapels were both added to the Church around 1300. the South Chapel is known as both a Chapel of John the Baptist and as the Honywood Chapel, the latter because of the monuments to Sir Thomas Honywood and Sir William Honywood as well as a number of dedications to the family on monuments on the walls and ledgers on the floor. In the 1877 restoration the family also paid for a new roof for the chapel.The interior of St James  Demographics  278x278pxOccupations of males and females in Elmsted reported in the 1881 census.Elmsted was featured in the 1881 census which provides information on the occupational structure of the population at the time. The majority of men and women worked in agriculture which reflects the rural nature of the small parish. The second largest group at that time were those working in domestic service or in offices. It is made up largely by women who were working at home whilst others living in the house would go out and work. Notably only 1 women was recorded as working in agriculture which shows how the industry was male dominated at the time. After the mid 19th Century the village began a steady decrease in population from its peak in 1850 of just over 500 people to just over 250 in 1960. It has since risen somewhat back up to just under 300 people. In 2011 according to the census data there were 156 females and 163 males living in the parish. In that same year the population was largely made up of people between 35 and 64 suggesting that there are a large number of people who commute out of, Elmsted where there are very few employers, to towns nearby. Though it is notable that in Elmsted 25.7% of economically active 16 to 74 year olds are self-employed. This is far higher than the average for England which is only 9.8%. This may be linked to the bed and breakfasts, brewery and farms which are so common in the parish which provide full-time self-employment for many residents of the parish.

It's not a world likely to appeal to mass audiences, but it is an unmistakably distinct one that you won't soon forget.\\" \\\\- Dave Heaton / Erasing Clouds Erasingclouds.com Track listing # \\"Devilspeak\\" # \\"Feel Try Fury\\" # \\"Buffalo Spiders\\" # \\"North Morning Silver Trip\\" # \\"Ringworm Interiors\\" # \\"Spectacle\\" # \\"You First\\" # \\"Knifesong\\" # \\"Kingdom of teeth\\" # \\"Oil Birds\\" # \\"Lizard Food\\" # \\"Not So Fast\\" # \\"Apparent the Red Angus\\" # \\"Playhouse Hostage\\" # \\"Straps Hold Up the Jaw\\" # \\"Correcto\\" # \\"Star Peppered Wheat Germ\\" # \\"Silver Eyeballs\\" # \\"Decathalon\\" # \\"Peace needle\\" # \\"Drill Sgt.

The Schapendoes was originally a herding dog and general farm dog, but today also participates in dog sports such as agility and flyball. History The Schapendoes descends from a general type of farm and herding dog popular in the Drenthe province of the Netherlands, and the Veluwe, an area of forests and swampland. (\\"does\\" is a local dialect meaning \\"swamp\\" see e.g. the town of Doesburg) The dogs there had many names, and were not a specific breed as we use the term today. They were the local working dog, adapted to the people, environment, and types of work needed. They were exhibited in early dog shows (in the 1870s) as Domestic herding dog. The dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and the modern day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first recognised the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954. Related breeds are the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Owczarek Nizinny), the Old English Sheepdog, the Briard, the Bergamasco Shepherd (Cane da pastore Bergamasco) and the Old German Sheepdog (Schafspudel), all of which are small versions of the \\"mountain type\\" herding and livestock guardian dogs.Brief Historical Summary, in the breed standard (PDF file) The breed was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1971, as breed number 313 in Group 1, Section 1: Sheepdogs. Exported to the North America, the breed is recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club (as Dutch Sheepdog)Canadian Kennel Club Breeds and the United Kennel Club (USA) in their respective Herding groups. The American Kennel Club has listed the Schapendoes as part of its Foundation Stock Service, the first step in breed recognition.Schapendoes, American Kennel Club Additionally, it is recognised by numerous minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog registry businesses. Appearance The Schapendoes is a medium-sized dog with long, thick fur on the body, legs, tail, and face. Small ears hang down, covered with long fur. The face has a moustache and beard. The coat is of any colour. alt=A close-up of the facial features of a black and white Schapendoes. Height is up to 50 cm (19.7 in) at the withers and 12–20 kg (26–44 lb), up to 25 kg (55 lb) for males, in weight. Temperament The breed standard describes the Schapendoes as friendly, high spirited, and affectionate. He is not a guard dog or aggressively protective, and if properly socialised while young, would most likely make a good family dog, as well as a good dog for active sports. Lively and intelligent dogs must receive regular training and outings. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The Schapendoes is furthermore very independent and will cooperate with its trainer, rather than obey orders. Health Health problems or claims of exceptional health have not been documented for this breed. Before acquiring a puppy, make sure that sire and dame have all health clearances.

In 1940 Mrs. Jones married Mr. Forest Jones, she was the daughter of Colonel and Bertha Bouldin, of Maxton, North Carolina. Biography =Early life and education= Mrs. Jones, born in Fairmont, North Carolina, received her education from the Public Schools of Robeson County, North Carolina. A self-made woman, she had very little formal school training. At age 14, she assumed all the motherly duties for her 11 siblings, after their mother's death. Effie and her siblings worked alongside their father as sharecroppers. In 1946 Mrs. Jones, like many other blacks of the time period, was a member of the Great Migration (African American). During the Great Migration of 1916-1930, over one million blacks moved from the south to the north in search of better lives. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 left the South during the two-year period of 1916-1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage created in the wake of the First World War. Mrs. Jones migrated north to escape racial discrimination, and poverty. She sought employment opportunities and became a source of income for her sharecropper parents and her children. Reluctantly, she commuted between North Carolina and New Jersey to ensure a better life for her family.William H. Frey, \\"The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965-2000\\", The Brookings Institution, May 2004, pp.1-3 , accessed 27 Feb 2009 Mrs. Jones migrated north to Newark, New Jersey in 1952 and took a job as a live-in housekeeper for a very prominent, liberal doctor. While living in Newark, Mrs. Jones was very active in the Civil Rights Movement. She joined the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), the Order of the Eastern Star and the United Order of Tents.http://www.easternstar.org She helped register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. In 1964, due to the terminal illness of her father, she took her northern learned wisdom back to the south, to her home state of North Carolina, where she joined a well-known statewide civil rights and political activist, Dr (Rev) H. E. Edwards, a member of Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), in organizing black community events such as political fund raisers and voter registration drives. Their efforts were met with racist repression from state and local lawmen, White Citizens' Councils, and Ku Klux Klan (KKK) resulting in family harassment, threats, arson and other criminal acts. It was during this time (1968) that she, along with Dr Edwards and others, begin what would be her lifelong endeavor of helping young children. Career Mrs. Jones was one of the founding members of the Maxton Four County Community Services, Head Start Program in 1968. Head Start is a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. Created in 1965 by the Head Start Act, Head Start is the longest-running program to address systemic poverty in the United States. As of late 2005, more than 22 million pre-school aged children have participated in Head Start. She held several positions for the organization such as Food Services Director and Counselor for the Head Start Program; serving the Maxton, North Carolina area, Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, as well as other local communities. She completely devoted herself to the betterment of the community through the development of each and every child. She championed the rights of women, children, and families regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, or religion. Through that organization she has spearheaded education and mentoring programs. She believed that the culture of poverty and the cycle of poverty could be overcome through education. After her retirement in 1988, she often said that her greatest joy came from seeing her students become successful adults and positive contributors to society. =Marriage and children= In 1940 Mrs. Jones married Mr. Forest Jones, a decorated US Army World War II veteran and Master Mechanic, she was the mother to nine children, daughter: Rosemary and sons: Roger, Carlton, Perry, Willie, Colonel, George, Patrick, and Michael. Her offspring produced 29 grandchildren, and 37 great grandchildren at the time of her death. =Death= Effie Neal Jones died on April 30, 2002, at Moore Regional Hospital, Pinehurst, North Carolina of Heart Failure.

Depending on the tournament, a player might be rewarded for eliminating either a specific player, or any player. The reward is almost always a cash prize, and not tournament currency. Bounties are rare but do occur occasionally in professional tournaments.Bay101.com: Shooting Star They are more commonly only implemented in smaller tournaments, or charitable tournaments. In bounty tournaments that reward a player for every player they eliminate, the buy-in structure of the tournament may require each player to pay an additional amount for their own bounty chip, or token. This bounty chip is carried by the player throughout the tournament. If the player is eliminated, the bounty chip is given to the player who eliminated them. The bounty chips are cashed in, usually for the amount each player paid for the bounty chip. The winner can usually cash in their own chip. Some online tournaments use a more complicated schedule, whereby a player's own bounty increases with every elimination he makes. Some bounty tournaments assign a bounty to only a few players. This assignment is rarely random, and is usually pre-arranged with the players who have bounties on them, as such an assignment to a random entrant would significantly affect their game. Some tournaments may feature a celebrity bounty, if the tournament hosts have arranged for a celebrity to play in the tournament. This type of bounty arrangement is usually only the celebrity bounty variety, or if the player with a bounty on them is promoting the tournament. The aspect of having a bounty in a tournament can significantly affect the play of the tournament. For example, if a player with a lower amount of chips declares that they are all-in, other players may be more enticed to call the bet. Most professional poker players would alter their normal playing style to adapt to this aspect if they were to enter a bounty tournament. You must have at least the same amount of chips as the bounty holder (in other words, have them \\"covered\\") to take their bounty, as it's the player who takes the last chips from a player that is awarded the Bounty. This may not be the overall hand winner; the bounty is awarded to the player who wins the ‘relevant pot’ for the hand in question, which may be the main pot or one of several side pots. ‘Relevant pot’ means the pot in which the bounty player was all-in for their final chips. For example: Daniel (100 chips), Barry (200 chips), Vicky (400 chips), and Julian (1000 chips), are playing a hand in a No-Limit tournament. Daniel moves all-in, and Barry, Vicky and Julian call. The pot which Daniel is eligible for is known as the ‘main pot’. Betting continues ‘on the side’, in side pot 1. Barry moves all-in, and Vicky and Julian call. Betting continues between Vicky and Julian in side pot 2. Vicky moves all-in, and Julian calls. Barry shows the best hand. He wins side pot 1 and the main pot, eliminating Daniel. He receives the bounty for Daniel. Julian shows the next best hand, and wins side pot 2, eliminating Vicky. Julian wins the bounty for Vicky. Note that although Barry had the best hand overall, he didn’t have as many chips as Vicky and therefore could not eliminate her. Julian however did have enough chips, and therefore wins Vicky’s bounty Notes Poker gameplay and terminology ","title":"Bounty (poker)"},{"id":"19682843","text":"Mount Pandim is a Himalayan mountain located in Sikkim, India.

Originally the Coronet came with a single Epiphone New York pickup in the treble position. In 1959 Epiphone began shipping new Coronets with a P-90 pickup and began offering the Coronet with its signature cherry red finish. Some Coronets manufactured in 1964 were made under the Dwight brand. Dwight was a house brand used by Epiphone for Sonny Shields Music in East Saint Louis (Illinois), which was owned by Charles “Dwight” Shields. These Dwight-brand Coronets featured a \\"D\\" on the pickguard and the \\"Dwight\\" logo on the peghead.Achard, Ken (1990). The History and Development of the American Guitar, p. 72. The Bold Strummer Ltd. In the 1970s, production of the Coronet came to a halt when Epiphone left its facilities in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to move overseas. 90's Epiphone Coronet with OBL pickups There was a short run of Coronets in the late 1990s, which were made in Korea. These featured OBL model pickups, a single coil in the neck position and a humbucker in the bridge position, with a pull-out tone knob to tap the humbucker. As was the case with the original Coronet, the hardware and style of the Coronet varied through this short run. Some had six- on-a-side batwing-shaped headstocks, while others had more classic 3-on-a-side Gibson-style headstocks. The short-lived USA Coronet of 1990 had a similar pickup layout and matching electronics except for the addition of a two-octave rosewood fingerboard with rectangular block markers and a reverse droopy Explorer-style headstock. The USA Coronets came with the choice of gold hardware with stop tailpiece or black hardware with licensed Floyd Rose locking tremolo. Epiphone has announced to reissue the Coronet again later on in 2020. These will come with a wraparound bridge and a single P-90 pickup and will be available a black and a cherry red finish.

It is a tandem two-seater low-wing trainer with a metal airframe. The aircraft is capable of basic training functions including aerobatics, instrument and tactical flying, as well as basic training in use of weapons. The first prototype of Lasta 1 flew on 2 September 1985, while the first prototype of the current version, Lasta 3, flew on February 26, 2009. Lasta is the Serbian word for barn swallow. Design and development Lasta 95 (Swallow 95) in 2011. The Lasta was originally developed to be a replacement of the Utva 75 and, partially, Soko G-2 Galeb, which had been the most commonly used trainer aircraft of the Yugoslav Air Force up until 1991. The first prototype Lasta 1 was completed by the spring of 1985. Following completion of the initial testing phase, the first flight was achieved on September 2, 1985. In January 1989, design of a modified version – Lasta 2 was started, following changes in Yugoslav Air Force requirements. Lasta 2 was lighter, with shorter fuselage and a new electronics system including fire control Ferranti ISIS D-282. By the early 1990s Utva, and her partners, have produced enough parts for the completion of 10 pre-production airframes. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, all five existing prototypes were destroyed during the bombing of Utva Aviation Industry (a sixth prototype survived with damage and was donated to the Aviation Museum at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport). In 2006 development of the Lasta was restarted. The new version was known as the Lasta 95 and followed basic concepts of Lasta 2, with updates due to newer available technology. In 2009 it was announced that Iraq will purchase 20 of these trainer aircraft. With its specifications and updated avionics, the aircraft will ensure full pilot training for all elements of airplane application including: * basic flying, * aerobatics, * navigation flying, * basic elements of night flying, * category II instrumental flight, * basic elements of gunning, rocketing and bombing (GRB) * Light close air support of counterinsurgency operations and area patrol / light attack missions =Future improvements and developments= It is possible to install ejection seats, but with higher cost and weight of the airplane. It is also possible that new containers with armaments and sensors would be developed for Lasta 95, as well as a proposed turboprop version of the aircraft with more advanced training and combat capabilities. Versions There are three-factory versions of Lasta 95. =Lasta 95N= This light piston-propeller training aircraft is primarily intended for initial and basic training of military pilots. With in-line tandem seating, the trainer was developed in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (Joint Aviation Requirements) 23 regulations for acrobatic category of airplanes and it provides an easy transition to Kobac and then to jet at higher training levels. The LASTA is equipped with a six-cylinder 224 kW (300 HP) engine of the opposed-cylinder type, and a two-bladed metal propeller Hartzell HC-C2YR-4CF/FC 8475-6, which provides maximum flight velocity (at an altitude of 3000m and a takeoff weight of 1085 kg) of 345 km/h. The empty weight is 888 kg, and the maximum takeoff weight is 1210 kg for the aerobatic category and 1450 kg for the utility (armed) category. The total aircraft length is 7.97m. The trapezoidal wings have a wingspan of 9.7 m and a surface of 12.9 m2. The altitude barrier of flight is 6000 m. This propeller-driven low-wing aircraft has a tricycle retractable landing gear suitable for rough-field operations. Onboard GPS and Instrument Landing System (ILS) support the operations during CAT-II weather conditions. The aircraft is equipped with Mode S transponder for flight identification. Besides for training purposes, it can be used for combat fire training, rocket firing and bombing. The armed version of the LASTA 95 can be equipped with 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine guns, 57 mm rocket launchers or bombs weighing up to 120 kg on two hardpoints. =Lasta 95V-54= Lasta 95V-54 designation is for Serbian Air Force and Air Defence.

Exploded view of mechanism Overview In 1903, Percy Scott described a device he'd invented which was similar to the Vickers clock. In April 1904, Vickers worked with Scott and patented their device, samples of which were available for trials in 1905. In 1906, the Royal Navy ordered 246 units for use on their ships. More than one might be installed, to allow for tracking multiple targets. The device consisted of a circular dial with a single central rotating pointer, like a clock. The dial was engraved with the ranges in yards. The clockwork motor drove the pointer at a constant rate determined by a control on the right hand side of the device. This had a handle and its own dial, on which the rate of change of range (or \\"range rate\\") could be selected. This was calculated by other means, often by use of a Dumaresq or a time-and-range plot. A second rotating handle was fitted to the left of the clock. This was connected by gears to the dial plate, which rather than being fixed as on a clock, could be rotated. One turn of the handle would rotate the scale relative to the pointer. Thus the clock could be set to the initial range to a ship, or corrections could be made to update the reading without disturbing the mechanism. The range on the dial was the range as passed to gunners for firing, and as such included any corrections necessitated by time of flight, wind, etc., rather than being a true instantaneous record of distance to the enemy. By 1913, a second red pointer had been added to the original black one, attached to it by a friction grip, which could be adjusted relative to the original hand, so that one indicated true range and the other the corrected range for targeting. Once some shots had been fired, spotters would report the fall of shell (which could be observed because of the large waterspouts where the shells hit the sea) and the range would be corrected up or down depending whether the shells were short or over the enemy. Initial estimates of range were obtained using optical rangefinders. The dial was fitted with three separate scales reading , and in 100-yard steps, with marked subdivisions every . The handle for adjusting the dial was added from 1908; previously, the initial position of the dial plate had to be set by rotating it directly. Initial models had the rate setting dial calibrated in both knots and 'seconds per 50 yards'. This was altered in 1909 to yards per minute, which standardised measurement was used on other equipment designed to work with the clock. An important aspect of the Vickers range clock, as well as other designs using a wheel-on-disc drive for the variable speed motor, such as the electrical clock used in the Dreyer Fire Control Table, was that it could only generate ranges according to a constant range rate. In most firing scenarios, the range rate would change continuously. In such cases, the operators of the clock would periodically alter the range rate in discrete increments as conditions suggested. Mechanism Variable speed was obtained using a rotating metal disc driving a rubber wheel resting against it. The position of the wheel could be moved in and out along a radius of the disc, so that the wheel turned at different speeds (faster the further out). Operating errors would occur from adjusting the wheel, as the wheel tended to slide as it was dragged across the face of the spinning disc as it was adjusted. The workaround adopted was to adjust the rate quickly and in a discrete manner, accepting that the generated ranges would deviate moderately from the desired continuous hyperbolic curves that predominated in use. In 1909, alterations were made to the clockwork drive to improve reliability of the governed speed and to increase the power of the drive. A small aperture on the dial would reveal a visual tell-tale which indicate that the clock's spring required winding.

Operating from 1986 until 2002, most of the company's facilities were originally part of Crown Zellerbach's container division. Based in Deerfield, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago, Gaylord Container completed its initial public offering in July 1988 and was listed on the American Stock Exchange.Gaylord Container Corporation - 1988 Annual Report After less than 16 years as a company, it was acquired by a competitor, Temple-Inland, in early 2002, which was acquired by International Paper a decade later in 2012. Company history =Origins= Gaylord Container was a by-product of the hostile takeover of Crown Zellerbach by Sir James Goldsmith in July 1985, which resulted in the break-up of the San Francisco-based forest products corporation in May 1986. The more profitable manufacturing assets (fine paper mills) were sold to the James River Corporation of Richmond, Virginia (which merged with Fort Howard and became and was based in St. Louis, Missouri. It was acquired by Crown Zellerbach in 1955,Online Archives of California - Records of Crown Zellerbach Corp. - accessed 2009-06-07 which renamed its brown paper operations the \\"Gaylord Container Division.\\" The Gaylord name remained in CZ into the early 1980s, then was reduced to \\"Container Division\\" shortly before the hostile takeover. =Facilities= At its initiation in 1986, Gaylord Container had three paper mills (containerboard), located in Antioch, California, Bogalusa, Louisiana, and Baltimore, Ohio, with converting plants in twelve states. In 1937, Gaylord Container Corp. had acquired the Bogalusa-based Great Southern Lumber Company and its Bogalusa Paper Mill.C.W. Goodyear, II. 1950. Bogalusa Story. Wm. J. Keller, Inc.: Buffalo, NY Retrieved 2013-11-21 The mill of Mid-America Packaging in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was integrated into Gaylord Container in June 1988. The Ohio mill was sold for $17 million in November 1988, it produced only the less-profitable corrugating medium from recycled pulp. The Antioch mill in northern California (midway between San Francisco and Sacramento) had used 100% recycle pulp since 1977, and had a gas turbine co-generation facility, installed in 1982. The mill and adjacent converting complex was opened in 1956 by Crown Zellerbach to use pulp from British Columbia to make tissue, toweling, multiwall bags, and linerboard for the northern California market. The pulp was delivered by company ship to the Antioch mill's deep-water dock on the San Joaquin River. Eventually the consumer products were phased out and the mill downsized to a single Fourdrinier paper machine ( wide), which produced linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated boxes. Recycled pulp from the adjacent Secondary Fiber mill was first produced in 1969, reclaimed from old corrugated containers (OCC) and initially used as an extender for virgin pulp. Within eight years the mill's fiber supply was 100% recycle for all its grades of linerboard and medium, and for nearly a decade the Antioch mill was home of the \\"World's Largest Recycle Paper Machine.\\"Crown Zellerbach - Welcome to our Antioch Mill, 1983 brochure In March 1988, Gaylord Container acquired the adjacent Fibreboard kraft pulp and paper mill from Louisiana-Pacific and it became the California east mill. Despite a $50 million infusion to revive the 1949 facility, problems with wood chip supplies and prices on the West Coast, antiquated equipment, and air quality issues forced the east mill to shut down within three years, in February 1991, eliminating 320 jobs. Shortly after the acquisition by Temple-Inland, the west mill was idled in September 2002,dtsc.ca.gov - Public Notice - Gaylord West Mill - 2010 - accessed 2011-09-27 due to over-capacity of papermaking within the newly expanded company. The Antioch gas-turbine power plant continued to operate, selling electricity to the local utility (PG&E;) until shut down in February 2006. Both mill sites east of Antioch (north of Wilbur Road) were demolished and leveled. () Gaylord Container also operated a DMSO facility in Bogalusa, now Gaylord Chemical Corporation, adjacent to its pulp and paper operations. =Acquisition= After less than sixteen years as a company, it was acquired by a competitor, Temple-Inland, in early 2002, which was acquired by International Paper a decade later in 2012.

The name \\"Green Left\\" is also used by a variety of organisations which espouse socialist or Marxist principles, but with a greater emphasis on environmental preservation than previous iterations of socialism and communism.  Politics  = Europe = In Europe, the green left arose partly out of the declining Eurocommunist tendency that has been mostly associated with various communist parties in the continent. As a result, many former communist parties and remnants of communist parties were either reestablished or fused into existing green parties. Far-left political parties or joint electoral lists have been formed over the years, most often between Marxist and radical greens.

Biography  \\"Spero was a large man with dark hair, a dark complexion and was good looking in a rough way\\" Philip Carlo wrote. \\"He was fair, smart, and exceedingly well versed in the ways of the street\\".The Butcher: Anatomy of a Mafia Psychopath by Philip Carlo According to the testimony of boss-turned-informant Joe Massino, Anthony Spero was inducted into the Bonanno crime family by Carmine Galante on June 14, 1977. The ceremony was held in a Queens bar, and among those inducted were Massino, Joseph Chilli, Jr., Peter Monteleone and several other men. A reserved and low profile man, Spero's hobby was breeding racing pigeons in coops on the roof of a Bensonhurst building. To avoid electronic surveillance from law enforcement, Spero sometimes held crew meetings on the same rooftop. Spero was married with two daughters, Jill and Diana, and owned a home in Staten Island. One of Spero's most lucrative enterprises was selling stolen fireworks. He owned huge warehouses of fireworks and made close to $5 million a year selling them. Every Fourth of July, Spero would stage a fireworks display on Bath Avenue in Bath Beach, Brooklyn that allegedly cost him several hundred thousand dollars. For these parties, Spero also supplied food that was said to be enough to feed all of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.\\" Spero was a close associate of Colombo crime family capo Gregory Scarpa and Lucchese crime family capo and future underboss Anthony Casso. Following the death of Alphonse Indelicato and the indictment of his son Anthony Indelicato, Bonanno mobster Thomas Pitera became close to Spero. Spero later inducted Pitera into the Bonanno crime family at an initiation ceremony at the house of Bonanno capo Frank Lino.  Murders  In 1990, Spero ordered the murder of Louis Tuzzio, a Bonanno associate who had botched a mob killing. An ambitious gangster, Tuzzio had offended Spero by demanding to become a made man. In January 1990, Tuzzio was found dead in his car in Brooklyn with a bullet wound in the back of the head.\\"MY SON FEARED DEATH: MOB FIGURE'S MOTHER\\" By MIKE CLAFFEY New York Daily News March 30, 2001 In 1991, Spero ordered the murder of Vincent Bickelman, a burglar from Brooklyn.

The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.  Background  After early French and Spanish victories at Tourane (Da Nang) and Saigon, the Cochinchina campaign reached a point of equilibrium in 1860. In March 1860 the allies were forced to evacuate Tourane. At the same time they were besieged in Saigon, which had been captured by a Franco-Spanish expedition under the command of Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly on 17 February 1859. The arrival of massive reinforcements from the French expeditionary corps in China in 1860 allowed the French to regain the initiative. In early 1861 Admiral Léonard Charner broke the Siege of Saigon by defeating the Vietnamese besieging army at the Battle of Ky Hoa (25 February 1861). This victory gave Charner the opportunity to take the offensive against the Vietnamese, and he decided to strike first at Mỹ Tho and next at Biên Hòa.  The Mỹ Tho expedition  The expedition against Mỹ Tho was initially led by capitaine de frégate Bourdais, captain of the aviso Monge. Besides Monge, the other warships at his disposal were the first-class gunboats Alarme and Mitraille and the small gunboats Nos. 18 and 31, commanded respectively by lieutenants de vaisseau Sauze, Duval, Peyron and de Mauduit. The flotilla carried a landing force of 200 French sailors, 30 Spanish soldiers and one mountain mortar.Thomazi, Conquête, 54–5 Bourdais was ordered to advance on Mỹ Tho from the north, along a creek known to the French as the Arroyo de la Poste. On 1 and 2 April he bombarded and captured two forts at the entrance to the creek, and went on to destroy a series of stockades erected by the Vietnamese to bar access.Thomazi, Conquête, 56 On 4 April the expedition received important reinforcements from Saigon: 200 chasseurs, 100 sailors, two companies of marine infantry, two 40-millimetre mountain guns and two mortars. These reinforcements arrived aboard the aviso Echo. Command of the expedition was now given to Charner's aide-de-camp capitaine de vaisseau Le Couriault du Quilio, assisted by capitaine de frégate Allizé de Montignicourt as chief of staff. A further reinforcement of 100 sailors arrived on 6 April, under the command of capitaine de frégate Desvaux.Thomazi, Conquête, 56 Between 6 and 11 April Le Couriault du Quilio's expedition fought its way along the Arroyo de la Poste, against Vietnamese resistance of varying intensity.Thomazi, Conquête, 56–7 On 8 April the expedition was reinforced with three more gunboats (Nos. 16, 20 and 22), commanded respectively by lieutenants de vaisseau Gougeard, Béhic and Salmon.Thomazi, Conquête, 57 On the evening of 9 April the Vietnamese launched two fireships against the French gunboats. Enseignes de vaisseau Joucla and Besnard took both vessels under tow and ran them aground in a tributary creek, where they burned themselves out.Thomazi, Conquête, 57 On 10 April a French scouting party led by Captain du Chaffault advanced up to the walls of Mỹ Tho and exchanged shots with the defenders before returning to make its report. Le Couriault du Quilio pressed forward with his gunboats, which were towing several sloops carrying 300 soldiers and sailors. Capitaine de frégate Bourdais, the original expedition commander, led an attack on Fort No. 5 with Gunboat No. 18 (see map), but was killed by a cannonball in the first exchange of fire. The French gunboats soon beat down the fire of the fort, and its defenders abandoned it before it was assaulted. The capture of this fort, renamed Fort Bourdais by the French, opened the route to Mỹ Tho.Thomazi, Conquête, 57 On 11 April the expedition closed up on Mỹ Tho, and prepared to assault the town on the following day. In the event, the assault was not necessary. A flotilla of warships under the command of Admiral François Page, who had been sent by Charner to sail up the Mekong river to attack Mỹ Tho by sea, presented itself before the town on 12 April. Mỹ Tho was occupied by the French on the same day without a shot being fired.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 32–3  References   Bibliography  Taboulet, G., La geste française en Indochine (Paris, 1956) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine française (Hanoi, 1931) My Tho My Tho My Tho My Tho My Tho 1861 in Vietnam Conflicts in 1861 History of Tiền Giang Province Cochinchina Campaign Mỹ Tho April 1861 events ","title":"Capture of Mỹ Tho"},{"id":"19683310","title":"Anatolia College"},{"id":"19683311","text":"Harold Widom Harold Widom (born 1932) is an American mathematician best known for his contributions to operator theory and random matrices.

At the University of Chicago he obtained an M.S. (1952) and Ph.D., the latter on a thesis Embedding of AW*-algebras advised by Irving Kaplansky (1955). He taught mathematics at Cornell University (1955–68) where he started his work on Toeplitz and Wiener- Hopf operators, partly inspired by Mark Kac. Widom was appointed in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz and became professor emeritus in 1994. His research areashomepage at UCSC. were in integral equations and operator theory, in particular the determination of the spectra of a semi-infinite Toeplitz matrix and Wiener-Hopf operators, and the asymptotic behavior of the spectra of various classes of operators. The latter was looked at from the point of view of pseudodifferential operators (which generalize both integral and partial differential operators) on manifolds. More recently, his mathematical contributions with his long-term collaborator Craig Tracy have been recognized through the award of several prizes for their joint work on Tracy–Widom distribution functions for random matrices. They used integral operators to obtain explicit representations, in terms of Painlevé transcendents, of the limiting distributions of the largest and smallest eigenvalues in many models of random matrices (see Fredholm determinants). These same distributions have since been shown to arise in numerous other physical models, in random growth models, and in asymptotic combinatorics. He has been the author of two books and more than 120 journal articles, and is an associate editor of Asymptotic Analysis, Journal of Integral Equations and Applications and Mathematical Physics, Analysis, and Geometry.

His most recognized album, Sea of Glass, 1992, peaked at #11 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart.[ AllMusic : Giles Reaves - Charts & Awards]  Biography  Reaves got his start in the Nashville country music business in the 1980s, as an engineer working for producer Marshall Montgomery. MCA producer Tony Brown overheard Reaves' space music improvisations in a studio late one night, and signed him for a contract that resulted in two solo albums and a collaboration with Jon Goin on the MCA Master Series.[ AllMusic : Giles Reaves - Biography] MCA provided little promotion or distribution for these albums, but 1986's Wunjo received critical acclaim from Electronic Musician magazine, which named it a top electronic album of all time. Wunjo first appeared on the U.S. public radio show Hearts of Space (HoS) in PGM 113: Scorpio, 1986. Pieces from Reaves's albums have appeared in 17 HoS programs broadcast during the show's 25-year history. In February 2000, HoS broadcast a retrospective program dedicated to Wunjo since it was long out of print at that point. (PGM 551: Wunjo Revisited) In 1992, HoS producer Stephen Hill contacted Reaves to tell him about fans of HoS who still wrote to him wanting copies of Wunjo, which were unavailable because of MCA's original limited distribution. With the expiration of the MCA contract, Reaves had another album of unpublished music that interested Hill. Reaves signed with Hill's Hearts of Space Records for the release of Sea of Glass, which remained on the new age charts for four months. Music journalist Bert Strolenberg wrote about Sea of Glass in 2007, \\"This classic space music recording by Nashville-based synthesist Giles Reaves is one of those milestones that can stand the test of time for decades, as it still sounds fresh and inspiring after all these years.\\"Sea of Glass Review, Sonic Immersion, Bert Strolenberg, 2007 Later in the 1990s, Reaves joined the improvisational space music group Spacecraft, described by Star's End radio as \\"one of the leading voices in the spacemusic community\\".Profile: Spacecraft, Star's End Radio Reaves also appeared on Tony Gerber's Blue Western Sky on the Lektronic Soundscapes label. In 2001, Kaleida Visions was released by the Space for Music team. SFM included Reaves as an original member along with Kirby Shelstad, with whom he also collaborated in live performances and on recordings. In 2002, with Spacecraft and also as a solo artist, he performed at the Nashville Space for Music Festival, along with other noted Nashville artists including Aashid Himons & Future Man from Bela Fleck & the Flecktones, Robert Rich, the West Tennessee ensemble Zero Ohms, and others.Space for Music Festival offers Nashville fans alternative, Nashville TheCityPaper] The space music festival had been founded by fellow Spacecraft band-member Tony Gerber in 1986.Tony Gerber of Spacecraft (Interview), Jerry Kranitz, Aural Innovations #6 (April 1999). Reaves also creates 3D renderings that have been used for CD cover artwork. Beyond space music, Reaves has another career as an engineer and co-producer for the Nashville rock music scene, including work with Dessau and Grinning Plowmen. He also collaborated with Afrikan Dreamland, Bedlam, Lisa Germano, Jaime Kyle, Tom Littlefield, Bill Lloyd, and Lounge Flounders.
