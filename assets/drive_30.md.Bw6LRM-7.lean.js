The routing was previously designated as State Highway 69 in 1971. Vandalism to the road signage as a result of its numbering had reached epidemic proportion by 1989, driving a resolution that the number of the road needed to be changed. The cost of resigning the roadway was considered reasonable by local governments, compared to that of the measures by law enforcement agencies that would be necessary to stop the vandalism. In 1992, the district requested and was granted renumbering of this route to State Highway 112. Route description Overall, there are two segments of the highway that run more east and west and one that runs north and south. The southern terminus of SH 112 is at exit 343 of Interstate 20 within the city limits of Eastland. Continuing east from the frontage road is Farm to Market Road 570. SH 112 travels west along East Main Street through a commercialized area surrounding the interchange. After crossing the Leon River, it enters downtown Eastland and intersects SH 6 at Seaman Street. SH 6 travels south and west from this point, while SH 112 continues north along North Seaman Street. It crosses the Leon River again and passes the entrance to Eastland Municipal Airport and exits the city limits. SH 112 continues north through the barren lands of Eastland County before curving to the west northwest in the unincorporated community of Morton Valley. In Morton Valley, SH 112 intersects the western terminus of Farm to Market Road 101. After passing a radio tower and a gas processing plan, the highway ends at a stop- controlled intersection with U.S. Route 183. History SH 112 was originally designated on August 11, 1925 as a route from Karnes City north to Nixon then northeast to near Gonzales. On July 17, 1934, the section south of Nixon was transferred to SH 29. On January 19, 1935, this section was changed back to SH 112. On September 22, 1936, the section south of Nixon was transferred to SH 80. The route was completed by September 26, 1939, but was reassigned to SH 200. This section of highway has had five different state numbering since its inception. It was originally numbered as SH 22 from 1917 until 1923. In 1923 it was reassigned to SH 67. On September 26, 1945 it was renumbered again as SH 6 when it was extended. It kept this numbering until August 4, 1971, when SH 6 was reassigned to roadways further to the west. The route was then redesignated as SH 69. On September 14, 1992, the route was finally redesignated SH 112 due to vandalism issues.

Life Tian Xu was from Wuzhong County (ÁÑ°ÁµÇÁ∏£), Youbeiping Commandery (Âè≥ÂåóÂπ≥ÈÉ°), which is in present-day Jizhou District, Tianjin. He was a grand-nephew of Tian Chou, an official who served under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty. In 220, after Cao Pi (Cao Cao's son and successor) ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as its first emperor, he wanted to honour Tian Chou for his good moral character. However, as both Tian Chou and his son were already deceased, Cao Pi decided to make Tian Xu the successor to Tian Chou, and he awarded Tian Xu the title of a Secondary Marquis (ÈóúÂÖß‰æØ). In 263, Tian Xu participated in the campaign against Wei's rival state, Shu Han, as an officer under the Wei general Deng Ai. When Deng Ai and the Shu general Jiang Wei were locked in a stalemate at Jiange (ÂäçÈñ£), Deng Ai decided to take a shortcut from Yinping (Èô∞Âπ≥) to Jiangyou (Ê±üÊ≤π) to bypass Jiang Wei's defences. Tian Xu disobeyed Deng Ai's orders when he refused to advance, so Deng Ai wanted to execute him. Later, after Deng Ai defeated the Shu general Zhuge Zhan at Mianzhu (Á∑úÁ´π), Jiang Wei retreated from Jiange to Ba Commandery (Â∑¥ÈÉ°). Another Wei army led by Zhong Hui advanced towards Fu County (Ê∂™Á∏£), where Zhong Hui ordered Tian Xu, Hu Lie, Pang Hui and others to lead troops to pursue Jiang Wei's retreating army. Later that year, after the Shu emperor Liu Shan had surrendered and Shu had been vanquished by Wei, Zhong Hui planned to rebel against the Cao Wei state. He accused Deng Ai of plotting a rebellion and had Deng Ai arrested and sent back to the Wei capital, Luoyang. Zhong Hui staged a revolt in 264 but it was crushed and he lost his life. Deng Ai's subordinates wanted to bring their superior back from Luoyang. Wei Guan, another Wei officer who plotted with Zhong Hui against Deng Ai, feared that Deng Ai would take revenge on him if he returned, so he instigated Tian Xu to kill Deng Ai by reminding him of how Deng Ai wanted to execute him at Yinping in the previous year. Tian Xu led his men to intercept Deng Ai at Sanzao Village (‰∏âÈÄ†‰∫≠), Mianzhu, where he killed Deng Ai and his son Deng Zhong (ÈÑßÂø†).

Biolib Taxonomy The species was first described by the Swedish entomologist and arachnologist Carl Alexander Clerck (1709-1765) in 1757 as Araneus cucurbitinus Chamberlin & Ivie, 1942 : A hundred new species of American spiders. Bulletin of the University of Utah, vol.32, n. 13, p.1-117 and was revised in 1942 by Chamberlin & Ivie with the name Araniella cucurbitina. Distribution This species occurs in the Palaearctic. It is widespread in north-western and central Europe,Fauna europaea in Turkey, and in Central Asia to China and Korea. World Spider Catalog Version 19.0 It can also be found in parts of North America, where it was probably introduced. Habitat These spiders are mainly found on forest clearings, in woods, bushes, scrub and hedgerows and in low vegetation. Spider and Harvestman Recording Scheme website Description Females of Araniella cucurbitina are larger than males. Moreover the male is generally much slimmer, with more developed limbs (Sexual dimorphism). In fact females grow up to , while males only up to . Nentwig, Blick, Gloor, H√§nggi & Kropf, 2016 Spiders of Europe. Adult spiders in Spring show a basic green color. The cephalothorax (prosoma) is light yellowish to red-brown, but the abdomen (opisthosoma) is definitely green or yellowish green, with four pairs of black lateral spots. The legs are yellowish green or yellow-red-brown. On the lower end of the abdomen there is a red mark. At the extremities of the pedipalps, males have the copulatory organs, called palpal bulbs, similar to an ampoule, that are used to transfer sperm to the female. Freshly hatched spiderlings are red, and change to brown before the autumn. Araniella opisthographa is an almost identical spider which can only be distinguished from A. cucurbitina by a microscopic investigation. Araniella cucurbitina sens. lat. in Spider and Harvestman Recording Scheme website Biology Adults can be found mainly from May to July, but females last as late as September. These spiders do not use a hideout, because they are camouflaged by their green colour. They weave their orb-web between leaves and flowers. These webs are irregularly shaped and only about in diameter. They have between 15 and 30 rays. The spider usually stands in the middle of the web while waiting for prey. Egg sacs are commonly attached to the underside of leaves.

Description and distribution It is a small red shrimp, rarely longer than in length, typically found in brackish water pools near the sea shore, sometimes in large numbers. Such pools are referred to as anchialine pools (from the Greek ' = near the sea). Halocaridina rubra is endemic to the Hawaiian islands, and most commonly found in anchialine pools in fresh lava substrates on Hawaii and Maui Island; it has also been found in limestone karst pools and hypogeal habitats in limestone on older islands, such as Oahu. Its habitat is unique and sparsely represented on five of the eight high Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Kahoolawe, Oahu, Molokai and Hawaii). Ecology are herbivorous and detritivorous shrimp occupying both hypogeal (subterranean) and epigeal (surface) anchialine waters. Typical food of is algal and bacterial mats on the surface of rocks and other substrates in anchialine pools. Chelipeds are adapted for scraping and filtering of algal-bacterial layers. Serrated setae scrape the substrate surface, and filamentous setae collect the loosened food materials. The latter can also act as filters for filter feeding during phytoplankton blooms. The grazing activity of this shrimp is essential in maintaining the integrity of the crust, an actively growing matrix of plants, bacteria, diatoms, protozoans, and underlying siliceous and carbonate materials. Halocaridina is well adapted to the epigeal-hypogeal habitat in the pools. It reproduces in the subterranean portion of the habitat. Aquaria Recent popularity of as a low-maintenance pet in Hawaii and elsewhere has brought this otherwise obscure decapod crustacean into popular consciousness. A long-lived species, have been known to live for as long as 20 years in captivity. Sexes are difficult to distinguish, but gravid females carry clusters of red/maroon eggs under their pleopods, and early larvae are planktonic filter-feeders. They occasionally molt their shells, which can be seen as silvery exoskeletons at the bottom of the tank. There may be some evidence that mate after molting, or that molting and mating may be related.

It defines ways to describe most of the common 3D features and objects found in cities (such as buildings, roads, rivers, bridges, vegetation and city furniture) and the relationships between them. It also defines different standard levels of detail (LoDs) for the 3D objects, which allows the representation of objects for different applications and purposes, such as simulations, urban data mining, facility management, and thematic inquiries. CityGML is implemented as a GML application schema for the Geography Markup Language 3 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. Implementations In its most common implementation, which is the one generally used to disseminate and exchange data, CityGML datasets consist of a set of XML files and possibly some accompanying image files that are used as textures. Each text file can represent a part of the dataset, such as a specific region, a specific type of object (such as a set of roads), or a predefined LoD. The structure of a CityGML file is a hierarchy that ultimately reaches down to individual objects and their attributes. These objects have a geometry that is described using GML. Another important implementation of CityGML is the one of 3D City DB, which stores CityGML in a database.http://www.3dcitydb.net Version history The OGC Members adopted version 1.0.0 of CityGML as an official OGC Standard in August 2008.official OGC press release In late 2011, the OGC Members approved version CityGML 2.0.0.

Otago and were the only two Otago-class frigates; they differ from the Rothesays that served in the Royal Navy as they were not reconstructed to the Type 12I Leander-class standard with hangar and landing pad for a Westland Wasp anti-submarine helicopter as the main weapon system with torpedoes, depth charges and SS.12/AS.12 missiles to engage fast attack craft and surfaced submarines. Otago was launched on 11 December 1958 by Princess Margaret, and was commissioned into the Royal New Zealand Navy on 22 June 1960. The ship was named after the province of Otago in New Zealand's South Island, and associated with the city of Dunedin. The sensors of the Otago were generally updated in line with those of the Royal Navy's Rothesays to year 1980 standard but Otago unlike the RN frigates, was not fitted as a specialised anti- submarine frigates and retained the medium range air- and surface-warning Type 277Q radar, and original Type 275 and Type 262 fire control. Otago had Seacat anti-aircraft missiles fitted in New Zealand in 1963-64. Service history Otago took part in various Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) deployments and took part in a protest against French nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in 1973. The protest voyage was opposed by the National Party Their leader, Jack Marshall called the deployment 'irresponsible' and a 'futile, empty gesture' and RNZN officers, noting the Kirk Government approved the exercise on the day the International Labour Organisation and NZFOL called for stopping the French bomb tests M.Hayward.Dairy of the Kirk Years.

In the weeks preceding the bomb test, HMNZS Otago was constantly monitored and tested by French Navy Lockheed 2PV-5 Neptune maritime patrol aircraft. The instructions were that Otago project authority, but not engage, if seriously challenged by French frigates, RNZN frigates should do everything to increase distance and not use weaponry. The Neptunes flew various patterns fully testing the Otago's radar, electronic warfare and IFF passive and active capabilities. HMNZS Otago was flying 3 RNZN battle ensigns, officially as an aid to recognition G. Howarth. The Navy in NZ. An Illustrated History. Reed, (1981) p. 135 and to signal this was a RNZN operational warship on a political not a protest mission. France may have considered it an act of war and it is unlikely the RN was approached on the right and wisdom of flying an associated battle ensign on this exercise. A couple of Soviet research ships were out of sight 25 nm distant and two large USN naval auxiliary and spy ships, USS Corpus Christi Bay and USS Wheeling (T-AGM-8). The Royal Navy had deployed an RFA tanker and an amphibious landing ship to allow for evacuating the Pitcairn Islands if the French conducted a much larger \\"megabomb\\" test but that didn't happen. The objective was to lead a NZ government and world protest against 'illegal' atmospheric testing, demonstrate ability for 'innocent passage' in international waters, outside the French territorial 12-mile zone and, while avoiding confrontation, maintain the right to self defence. The small French frigate force probably indicated only a small nuclear trigger test of 5.4 kilotons was likely. Otago observed it from 21.5 miles and the crew was held in the enclosed citadel for only 20 seconds before allowed on the upper deck to observe the nuclear cloud. Cdr Tyrrell had witnessed the 1957 Christmas Islands hydrogen bomb test and saw the explosion as puny in comparison and well within safe limits for the crew at the distance. The NZBC journalists, Shaun Brown and David Barber of New Zealand Press Association on Otago, saw it as an \\"angry... red fireball\\" and rising white mushroom cloud.

As a young member of D'Oyly Carte, Pounds played tenor leads in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in New York and on tour in Britain and continental Europe from 1881 to 1887. After being promoted to principal tenor at the Savoy Theatre, he created the principal tenor roles in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), The Gondoliers (1889), The Nautch Girl (1891) and Haddon Hall (1892), and played other principal roles. After leaving D'Oyly Carte in 1895, Pounds became a prominent performer during the transition of musical theatre from comic opera to musical comedy, creating roles in the West End in both genres from the late 1890s to the 1920s. The operettas and musical comedies in which he starred included La poup√©e, The Duchess of Dantzic, The Belle of Mayfair, Princess Caprice, and the long-running hits Chu Chin Chow and Lilac Time.

The Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was a process by which the Roman Republic seized territories in the Iberian Peninsula that were previously under the control of native Celtiberian tribes and the Carthaginian Empire. The peninsula had various ethnic groups and a large number of tribes. The Carthaginian territories in the south and east of the peninsula were conquered in 206 BC during the Second Punic War. Control was gradually extended over most of the Iberian Peninsula without annexations. It was completed after the end of the Roman Republic (27 BC), by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, who annexed the whole of the peninsula to the Roman Empire in 19 BC. This conquest of the peninsula started with the Roman acquisition of the former Carthaginian territories in southern Hispania and along the east coast as a result of their defeating the Carthaginians (206 BC) during the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC), after which the Carthaginian forces left the peninsula. This resulted in an ongoing Roman territorial presence in southern and eastern Hispania. Four years after the end of this war, in 197 BC, the Romans established two Roman provinces. These were Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain) along most of the east coast (an area roughly corresponding to the modern Spanish autonomous communities of Valencia, Catalonia and part of Aragon) and Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain) in the south, roughly corresponding to modern Andalusia. Over the next 170 years, the Roman Republic slowly expanded its control over Hispania. This was a gradual process of pacification, rather than the result of a policy of conquest. Roman actions in Hispania were reactive. They responded to rebellions by the Hispanic tribes by suppressing them, rather than seeking to annex further territories. It was driven by numerous rebellions by the local tribes. Pacification and retention and extension of control over the local tribes was the priority. The Romans turned some of the native cities outside their two provinces into tributary cities and established outposts and Roman colonies (settlements) to expand their control. Administrative arrangements were ad hoc. Governors who were sent to Hispania tended to act quite independently from the senate due to the great distance from Rome. In the latter part of this period, the Roman senate attempted to exercise more control in Hispania, but this was to try to curb abuse and extortion by some Roman officials based in the peninsula. During this period, conquest was a process of assimilation of the local tribes into the Roman world and its economic system after pacification. This changed after the end of the Roman Republic and the establishment of rule by emperors in Rome. After the Roman victory in the Cantabrian Wars in the north of the peninsula (the last rebellion against the Romans in Hispania), Augustus conquered the north of Hispania, annexed the whole peninsula to the Roman Empire and carried out an administrative reorganisation in 19 BC. The Roman province of Hispania Citerior was significantly expanded and came to include the eastern part of central Hispania and northern Hispania. It was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis. Hispania Ulterior was divided into the provinces of Baetica (most of modern Andalusia) and Lusitania, which covered present day Portugal up to the River Durius (Douro), the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca in today's Spain.  The Second Punic War  = Carthaginian Iberia = Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, the Phoenicians (and later the Carthaginians) established trading contacts in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula as well as along part of the east coast. Their trading posts on the coast exported minerals and other resources available in Iberia and imported manufactures from the Eastern Mediterranean. During the 7th century BC, Greeks traders based in Massalia (modern Marseille) traded throughout the coastal commercial centres of the region without establishing a permanent presence and later founded the trading cities of Emporion (Ampurias) and Rhode (Roses). Part of this Greek trade was transported by Phoenician ships. The effect of contacts with the Greeks and the Phoenicians was that some of the coastal native peninsular peoples adopted some aspects of these eastern Mediterranean cultures. After Carthage was defeated by Rome in the First Punic War (264‚Äì241 BC) and lost the islands of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica to Rome, Hamilcar Barca conquered southern Spain. His family established Carthaginian dominions in most of southern Hispania. The subjugation of the tribes in Hispania, which was later extended over the greater part the east coast of the peninsula, was achieved by force or through tributes, alliances, or marriages with local chiefs. The peninsula would go on to supply Carthage with a significant number of conscripts from areas controlled by Carthage along with mercenaries, especially the Balearic slingers and the Celtiberians. = The Ebro Treaty = Hamilcar was succeeded by Hasdrubal the Fair, his son-in-law, in 226 BC. Rome concluded a treaty with Hasbrubal \\"with the stipulation that neither side should extend its dominion beyond the Ebro, while the Saguntines, situated between the empires of the two peoples, should be preserved in independence\\".Livy, The History of Rome, 21.2.7 The cities in the northern part of the east coast were concerned about further Carthaginian expansion and allied with Rome to get her protection. This led to the establishment of the River Ebro as the boundary of the spheres of influence of the Carthaginians and the Romans in eastern Hispania. The city of Saguntum (Sagunto, formerly Murviedro) also made an alliance with Rome. It lay about midway between the Ebro and New Carthage, (Roman, Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena). The latter was an outpost founded by Hasdrubal the Fair. At that time, the Carthaginian territories lay to the south of Saguntum. Hannibal, Hamilcar's son and Hasdrubal's successor, extended Carthaginian territories northwards to the banks of the River Ebro.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.5 As a result, Saguntum found itself surrounded by Carthaginian territory. = The Saguntum Matter = The Second Punic War between Carthage and Rome was sparked off by an attack by Hannibal on Saguntum. Hannibal found a pretext to wage war on Saguntum in a dispute between the city and the surrounding Turduli. In response, Saguntum sent envoys to Rome to ask for help. The Roman senate decided to send commissioners to Hispania to investigate the situation there, to warn Hannibal, if necessary, not to interfere with Saguntine matters and then to proceed to Carthage to submit the Saguntine complaints to the Carthaginian council. However, Hannibal had begun the siege of Saguntum before their departure. The senate decided to still send the commissioners to Hannibal and, if he refused to cease hostilities, they were to go to Carthage and demand his surrender in satisfaction of the broken treaty.Livy, The History of Rome, p. 21.6 The strong fortifications of Saguntum and stiff resistance by the populace repelled Hannibal's attack. Hannibal was seriously wounded when he approached the city wall. When the Roman ambassadors arrived at the port Hannibal said that it was unsafe for them to go to the city and that he was too busy to see them. Because he realised that if they could not see him they would go to Carthage, he sent a letter to his supporters in Carthage telling them to prevent his opponents from making any concessions to Rome.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.7.1. 5‚Äì9; 8; 9 The mission of the commissioners in Carthage achieved nothing. The Carthaginian council replied that the war was started by the Saguntines not by Hannibal, and that Rome would commit an act of injustice if it took the side of the Saguntines. After a lull that allowed the Saguntines to build a new wall to replace the damaged one, fierce fighting resumed. Hannibal's peace conditions were that Saguntum was to give all its gold and silver to the Turduli and that the townsfolk were to leave the city and go wherever the Carthaginians should order them. The Saguntines threw their gold and silver into a fire. Hannibal seized the city and there was a great slaughter of its inhabitants. The siege of Saguntum was said to have taken eight months. Hannibal then wintered in Cartago Nova.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.10‚Äì15.1‚Äì2 In Rome, there was a feeling of shame at not having sent help to Saguntum and at Rome being so unprepared for war. Hannibal was now expected to cross the River Ebro with the support of forces from the Hispanic tribes. The Romans were concerned that this might rouse the Gauls in northern Italy to rebel. The Romans decided to fight two campaigns, one in Africa (the Roman name for today's Tunisia and western Libya, Carthage's homeland) and one in Hispania. Six Roman legions (24,000 infantry and 1,800 cavalry) and 40,000 infantry of Italian allies and 4,400 allied cavalry were levied. A fleet of 220 ships of war and 20 light galleys was prepared. Two legions with 4,000 infantry and 300 cavalry each, 16,000 allied infantry and 1,800 allied cavalry and 160 warships and 12 light galleys were assigned to Tiberius Sempronius Longus, who was to lead the expedition to Africa. The expedition to Hispania was assigned to Publius Cornelius Scipio with two Roman legions, 14,000 allied infantry and 1,600 allied cavalry, and only 60 ships because an enemy naval offensive in Hispania was not expected.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.16.2.5; 17.1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì8 A Roman commission was sent to Carthage to inquire whether the city had sanctioned Hannibal's attack on Saguntum. If, as it seemed likely, Carthage admitted to this, they were to formally declare war on Carthage. According to Livy, a Carthaginian senator replied that Rome was seeking to extort a confession of guilt. He added that it was for Carthage to investigate and take proceedings against one of its citizens if he had done something on just his own authority. The only point Rome could discuss was whether Hannibal's action was compatible with the terms of the treaty. He argued that Saguntum was not a Roman ally at the time of the treaty. Hasdrubal had made a treaty with Saguntum that Carthage could not be bound to because it was made without her knowledge. Livy states that Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who had put forward the question, said: \\"Here we bring you war and peace, take which you please.\\" In defiance he was told to decide what he preferred himself. He said that he gave Carthage war and Carthage accepted.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.18 = The Roman campaigns = Roman wall of Emp√∫ries, initial entry point of Rome to the Iberian Peninsula  First campaign  In 218 BC, the expeditionary force to Hispania reached Massalia (Marseilles) to discover that Hannibal was already on his way to Italy. Publius Cornelius Scipio sent 300 cavalry inland to locate Hannibal's forces. By this time, Hannibal was crossing the River Rhone. He sent 500 Numidian cavalry towards the Romans to ascertain their numbers and their intentions. The two clashed and the Romans won a bloody battle. Hannibal continued his journey to Italy. Publius Cornelius Scipio decided to return to Italy to fight Hannibal there and sent his brother, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, to Hispania with the bulk of the expeditionary force. Gnaeus landed at Emporion, (Emp√∫ries). Livy states that Gnaeus gained the support of the coastal peoples north of the Ebro by renewing old alliances and forming new ones. Several strong contingents were recruited from amongst them.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.3. 5; 29.1‚Äì4; 29.11‚Äì5 Hanno, who was in charge of Carthaginian forces in Hispania, encamped near the Romans and offered battle. Gnaeus Scipio, who preferred to fight the two Carthaginian commanders separately (the other Carthaginian commander was Hasdrubal Barca) accepted. The result was the Battle of Cissa, which was fought near Tarraco (Tarragona). Hanno was defeated and lost 6,000 men while 2,000 of his men, including those who were guarding the camp, were taken as prisoners. The Romans seized the camp and looted the baggage left by Hannibal.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.60.5‚Äì8 Hanno and Indibilis, the chief of the Ilergetes whom Polybius described as 'despot of all central Iberia and a strenuous supporter of the Carthaginians', were also captured.Polybius, The Histories, 3.76.6‚Äì7 Hasdrubal, who had crossed the Ebro with 8,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry to look for the Romans as soon as they landed, heard of Hanno's defeat. He took to the sea and he found the Roman fleet near Tarraco. Hasdrubal landed his cavalry, which found and killed many of the Romans who were foraging in the surrounding countryside and forced them back to their ships. He then withdrew across the Ebro before Gnaeus Scipio returned. The latter left a small garrison at Tarraco and took the fleet back to Emporiae. Hasdrubal then incited the Ilergetes, who had given Gnaeus Scipio hostages, to revolt. Their men ravaged the fields of the local Roman allies. Gnaeus Scipio came out of his winter camp and devastated the territory of the Ilergetes, drove them to their capital, Atanagrus, besieged it, subdued the Ilergetes and exacted hostages and money. He then attacked the Ausetani, near the Ebro, who were Carthaginian allies and ambushed the Lacetani, who had come to the assistance to their neighbours, killing 12,000 of them. The siege of Atanagrus lasted for 30 days. After the chief of the Ilergetes fled to Hasdrubal, the town surrendered. Gnaeus Scipio established winter quarters in Tarraco.Livy, The History of Rome, 21.61 In 217 BC, Hasdrubal marched his army along the coast while his ships sailed near the shore. Gnaeus Scipio embarked with his best troops on 35 ships. His scouts spotted the enemy fleet at the mouth of the Ebro. The Carthaginians hastily prepared for battle, but in the Battle of the Ebro River the Roman ships approached in battle formation and the enemy ships fled. The Carthaginian line was overstretched and they did not manage to make it up the mouth of the river and ran ashore. The men disembarked at the mouth of the river and joined the infantry. The Romans dragged the beached ships into the water and seized 25 of them. Hasdrubal withdrew to Cartago Nova. The Romans devastated the coastal land as far as the pass of Castulo, which led through the Sierra Morena, north of Cartago Nova. Gnaeus Scipio then headed north gaining the submission of many of the communities north of the Ebro. However, Mandonius and Indibilis, the chieftains of the Ilergetes, got their tribesmen to ravage the lands of the Roman allies. Gnaeus Scipio sent a detachment that easily defeated them. Meanwhile the Celtiberians (who lived in east-central Hispania) invaded the area near Cartago Nova. They seized three fortified towns, defeated Hasdrubal, killed 15,000 and took 4,000 prisoners. Publius Scipio, whose command was extended, re-joined his brother, and brought a reinforcement of 30 warships, 8,000 troops, and a large supply convoy. As Hasdrubal was occupied fighting the Celtiberians, the brothers marched to Saguntum. Gnaeus Scipio took charge of the army and Publius Scipio commanded the fleet.Livy, The History of Rome, 22.19‚Äì22; 23.26.2 In 216 BC, after he received reinforcements of 4,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry from Africa, Hasdrubal gave orders for the Carthaginian fleet to be put into readiness to protect the Balearic Islands and the coast. There was a desertion of the naval captains who were no longer loyal after being been heavily censured for cowardice for abandoning the fleet at the Battle of the Ebro River. The deserters had started an agitation amongst the Tartesii and several cities revolted. Hasdrubal invaded the Tartesii's territory, surrounded their camp and won a battle. Hasdrubal was then ordered by Carthage to make for Italy as soon as possible and sent the general Himilco with an army to take Hasdrubal's place. Hasdrubal hired Gallic mercenaries and set off towards the Ebro. The two Scipios prepared to meet him to try and stop him joining Hannibal in Italy. They concentrated their forces at the Ebro and crossed the river. They decided to hinder his march by attacking Carthaginian allies. They prepared to besiege Hibera, a town near the Ebro that was the richest one in the area. Instead of coming to Hibera's aid, Hasdrubal attacked a town that was a recent Roman ally. The Romans abandoned the siege and headed towards Hasdrubal. The Carthaginians were routed and Hasdrubal fled with a few followers. This secured the wavering tribes for Rome forcing Hasdrubal to remain in Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome, 23.26‚Äì29 In 215 BC, Mago Barca, Hannibal's brother, was preparing to go to Italy with a force of 12,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, 20 elephants and 60 warships. Carthage considered sending him to Hispania instead. However, Sardinia looked vulnerable as the Romans were sending fresh and undisciplined troops there and the Sardinians were ready to rebel if they had a leader. Therefore, Mago was sent to Hispania while Hasdrubal was sent to Sardinia. The town of Iliturgi, which had gone over to the Romans, was attacked by three Carthaginian armies under Hasdrubal, Mago, and Hannibal, the son of Bomilcar. The Scipios forced their way through the three camps, brought corn (the town was in need for food) and encouraged the town to fight. The resultant battle was between 60,000 Carthaginians and 16,000 Romans. Yet, the Romans routed the enemy, which lost 16,000 men and 7 elephants; 3,000 men and 1,000 horses were captured. The three camps were seized. The Carthaginians attacked the nearby town of Intibili and recruited men from the area who were eager to fight for booty or pay to make up for their losses. There was a second battle and the Carthaginians lost 13,000 men; 2,000 men and 9 elephants were captured. Livy wrote that 'nearly all the tribes of Spain went over to Rome, and the successes gained in [Hispania] that summer were far greater than those in Italy'.Livy, The History of Rome, 23.32.5‚Äì12; 23.49.5‚Äì14 In 214 BC, Mago and Hasdrubal routed a large Hispanic force. All of Hispania south of the Ebro would have defected from the Romans if Publius Cornelius Scipio had not quickly crossed the river while the allies were still wavering. At first, he encamped at Castrum Album (probably modern Alicante), whose citadel had been fortified and stocked with grain. However, the area was filled with the enemy and a Roman column was attacked. The Romans moved to a quieter area and fortified a camp at Victory Mountain (location unknown). Gnaeus Scipio arrived with all his troops. Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo (usually called Hasdrubal Gisgo by modern writers) also arrived. The Carthaginians now had three commanders and a full army. They encamped across a river opposite the Roman camp. Publius Scipio went out with some light cavalry in reconnaissance, but he was spotted. He was wounded and would have been overpowered had he not seized a hill nearby. He was surrounded, but his brother rescued him. Castulo (which was a powerful city and a close ally of Carthage; Hannibal took a wife from there) defected to Rome. The Carthaginians set out to seize the Roman garrison at Iliturgis. Gnaeus Scipio went to its aid with a legion in light marching order, fought his way between the two Carthaginian camps, inflicted heavy losses on the besiegers and entered the town. The next day, he carried out a successful sortie. The Carthaginians lost over 12,000 men and more than 1,000 were captured. They left and begun to besiege Bigerra in the upper valley of the River Baetis (Guadalquivir). Gnaeus Scipio raised the siege without a fight. The Romans pursued them and there was another battle. Publius Scipio was carried to the field on a litter. The Romans won. Mago was sent by his brother to raise troops among the locals. These soon replaced the casualties and incited another battle. The enemy was defeated again and lost more than 8,000 men and 3 elephants; 1,000 men and 8 elephants were captured. Two Gallic chieftains, Moeniacoepto and Vismaro, fell in the battle. The Romans then seized Saguntum and expelled its Carthaginian garrison. The Turduli, who had brought about the war between Saguntum and Carthage, were defeated. They were sold into slavery and their city was destroyed.Livy, The History of Rome, 23.41‚Äì42 In 213 BC, Syphax, king of the Masaesyli of western Numidia (Algeria), rebelled against Carthage. The Scipios sent three officers to conclude an alliance. The Numidians were traditionally cavalrymen and did not have any infantry. Syphax asked for help with equipping and training infantry. One of the Roman officers, Statorius, stayed behind as an adviser. Syphax sent envoys to Hispania to get the approval of the Roman commanders and to persuade the Numidians in the Carthaginian army to defect to Rome. Statorius set up troops based on the Roman model and taught them entrenchment work and other military tasks. The Carthaginians sent envoys to Gala, the king of the Massylii of eastern Numidia to ask for his help. The young Masinissa persuaded his father to assign him the command of the war against Syphax. With Carthaginian help, he won a big battle. Syphax fled with some of his cavalry to the Maurusii, a Numidian tribe in northern Morocco, opposite Gades (Cadiz). Livy did not say what happened. He also wrote that the only thing worth recording for Hispania for that year was that the Romans hired Celtiberian mercenaries for the same sum the Carthaginians paid. This was the first time the Romans has mercenaries in their camp. He also wrote that for two years the conflict in Hispania 'was carried on by diplomacy more than by arm'.Livy, The History of Rome, 24.48‚Äì49; 25.32.1 Masinissa went on to lead Numidian cavalry troops, who fought alongside the Carthaginians in Hispania. In 212 BC, the two Scipios joined their forces and agreed that it was time for a push for end the war. They hired 20,000 Celtiberians and thought that they were enough as reinforcements. Hasdrubal Gisgo and Mago, had united their armies and their joint camp was about five days' march from the Romans. The camp of Hasdrubal Barca (the veteran in Hispania), near a city called Amtorgis, was the nearest one. The two Scipios wanted to attack this first, but were afraid that, if he was defeated, the other Hasdrubal and Mago might withdraw to forests and mountains and prolong the war. Thus, they divided their forces into two to cover the whole of Hispania. Publius was to lead two-thirds of the Romans and the Italian allies against Mago and Hasdrubal and Gnaeus was to lead one-third of the old army and the Celtiberians against Hasdrubal Barca. They set off together and encamped near Amtorgis in sight of the enemy on the other side of a river. Publius Scipio then moved on. Hasdrubal Barca realised that his opponents depended on the Celtiberians and set out to get them to defect. The Celtiberian chieftains were offered a large bribe to withdraw their forces. With this prospect to get equal money to go home, they left. Gnaeus Scipio withdrew as far as he could. The enemy had crossed the river and was pursuing him.Livy, The History of Rome, 25.32‚Äì33 Meanwhile, Publius Scipio had to face the arrival of Masinissa and his Numidians. Masinissa sought to check the Roman advance with constant attacks by day and night. This cut off the foragers. He also rode to the Roman outposts causing alarm and confusion. He often charged the ramparts at night. Indibilis was approaching with 7,500 Suessetani (who lived in today's western Aragon) to help the Carthaginians. The situation was developing into a siege. Publius Scipio was forced to risk advancing on Indibilis at night. When daylight came, he was having the better in an irregular battle fought in order of march rather than of battle. However, the Numidians showed up and swept round both flanks. The Carthaginian commanders also arrived and attacked the rear. Publius Scipio was killed by a lance. The Romans fled, but they were pursued and more were killed than in the battle. Night brought the carnage to an end. Hasdrubal and Mago went to Hasdrubal Barca by forced marches, thinking that their joint forces would bring the war to a close. Gnaeus realised that his brother had been defeated and withdrew, covering a great distance in one night and eluding the enemy. When at dawn the latter realised that he had gone, the Numidian cavalry pursued at full speed, caught up with him and forced him to defend himself while still trying to advance so as not to be caught by the infantry. As this seriously delayed him, Gnaeus Scipio led his men onto a hill. This enabled the Romans to fend off the Numidians. However, when the Carthaginian commanders arrived, they were without entrenchments and their position was untenable. The hill was rocky; there was no wood to make a stockade and no earth for a rampant and it was not steep enough to make the ascent difficult. The Romans tied together their saddles and the baggage to form a barricade. The gaps were filled with kits and packages. As it was difficult to clamber over it, remove the heavy obstacles or cut through the tightly packed saddles, the enemy was delayed for a considerable amount of time. However, they managed to make several openings. The Romans were slaughtered, but a good many managed to escape. Gnaeus Scipio was killed 29 days after his brother.Livy, The History of Rome, 25.34‚Äì36 The Roman defeat was almost total and they would have been driven out of Hispania had it not been for Lucius Marcius, an officer, who rallied the remnant of the routed forces, assembled a force and joined Tiberius Fonteius, who had been left in charge of Publius Scipio's camp. They pitched a camp north of the Ebro and the soldiers elected Lucius Marcius as their commander. The defences were strengthened and supplies were stored. Hasdrubal Gisgo crossed the Ebro. When the enemy approached, Lucius Marcius gave the battle signal, which caught the Carthaginians by surprise. The Roman army had been annihilated and they wondered where these men were from and who their commander was. They slowly withdrew and as the attack became more consistent they fled. Lucius Marcius withdrew. Lucius Marcius noticed that the Carthaginians were careless in guarding their camps and devised a plan. He considered that it was easier to attack Hasdrubal's camp while he was alone, before the three Carthaginian commanders might unite - the other Carthaginian camps were six miles beyond Hasdrubal's. A Roman contingent with some cavalry hid in a thickly wooded valley between the enemy camps, which cut off the road. The rest marched to the camp quietly at night. There were no outposts and no guards and they entered without opposition. The enemy were killed while half asleep. The Romans then went to the second camp where there was carelessness, too. The men at the outposts were unarmed. The Romans attacked and their shields were bloodied by the previous battle. This frightened the enemy, who fled. Those who were not killed were driven out of the camp. Livy noted that, according to one source, as many as 37,000 of the enemy were killed and 1,830 were captured. Another source held that only Mago's camp was taken, that 7,000 of the enemy were killed and that the battle against Hasdrubal was a sortie; here 10,000 were killed and 4,380 were captured. According to a third source 5,000 men were killed in an ambush when Mago pursued the Romans.Livy, The History of Rome, 25.37, 39 These feats were romanticised by Roman writers and it must be noted that they were made possible by the Carthaginians' delay in following up their advantage.Richardson, J. S., Hispaniae, p.44  Second campaign  In 211 BC, the Roman senate sent Gaius Nero to Hispania with 6,000 Roman and 6,000 allied infantry and 300 Roman and 600 allied cavalry. He landed at Tarraco, marched to the Ebro and took over the force of Tiberius Fonteius and Lucius Marcius. He then advanced against the enemy and occupied the two exits of the pass to Lapides Atri (Black Boulders), in Ausetanian territory, where Hasdrubal (Hamilcar's son) was encamped, thus shutting him in. Hasdrubal promised that he would take his army out of Hispania if Nero let him out of his position and asked him for talks the next day to put the terms in writing, which Nero accepted. Hasdrubal made the talks drag on for days. Meanwhile, his army gradually sneaked out of the pass at night. Finally, he left, too. Nero pursued him and offered battle, but he declined.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.17 Tribes in Hispania who had revolted after the defeat of the two Scipios showed no signs of restoring their allegiance. They decided to send a new commander-in-chief and increase the army in Hispania. There was uncertainty about the appointment, which demanded exceptional care. They decided to put the matter to the vote of the people. Publius Cornelius Scipio, the son and nephew of the two Scipios who had died in Hispania, who was only 24 and had not held high office, put his candidacy forward. He was elected unanimously. Livy did not explain the reason for the decision, or for this unprecedented election of a man below the required age for command. Scipio set off with a force he had formed out of the old army in Spain and reinforcements of 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Given his youth, Marcus Junius Silanus was appointed as his second in command to assist him. Scipio landed at Emporiae (or Ampurias, near the Pyrenees) marched to Tarraco and took over the army of Gaius Nero. He was met by envoys from all the friendly tribes. They reported that the tribes were unsettled due to the changing fortunes of the war. He visited these tribes and praised them for holding on after terrible blows and for keeping the enemy to the south of the Ebro, depriving them of any advantages from their victories. He inspected the winter quarters. After his return to Tarraco, Marcus Silianus succeeded Nero and the new troops were sent into winter quarters. The Carthaginian armies withdrew to their winter quarters, Hasdrubal to Gades (Cadiz) on the south coast, Mago inland, above Castulo and Hasdrubal Barca near Saguntum.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.18.3‚Äì4, 7‚Äì11; 19.1‚Äì2, 10‚Äì12; 20.1‚Äì6 In 210 BC, Scipio sent his ships and troops to the mouth of the Ebro and brought an allied contingent of 5,000 men. He crossed the Ebro with 25,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, and left Silanus in charge north of the Ebro with 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. Considering that he was not a match for the three Carthaginian armies together, he marched on Cartago Nova (Cartagena), a major Carthaginian stronghold that held enemy war stores, the war-chest, and hostages from all over Hispania. It had the only harbour in the area that could host a large fleet. He told his plan only to Gaius Laelius, who was told to time the arrival of his fleet there to coincide with Scipio's army. Scipio pitched camp opposite the north side of the town. The rear had a double rampant and the front was protected by the terrain. The town was on a promontory on the west side of an inlet two and a half miles deep. On the west, it was enclosed by a shallow lagoon. An isthmus a quarter of a mile long connected it with the mainland. Scipio lined up the ships in the harbour. Mago posted 2,000 townsfolk in the direction of the Roman camp and stationed 500 soldiers in the citadel and 500 on the top of the hill, towards the east. The rest of the townsmen were kept in reserve. The townsmen headed towards the Roman camp. The Romans withdrew a short distance to get closer to the reinforcements who were to be sent. Successive reinforcements put the enemy to flight. The defenders of the city wall left the fortifications. Scipio saw that in many places the walls had no defenders and ordered the ladders. The troops from ships started to attack the sea front. The soldiers got in each other's way. Very few of the ladders were long enough to reach the top of this very high wall and the longest ones were weak. Many men fell to the ground and the retreat was sounded. Scipio ordered fresh men to grab the ladders. Fishermen in Tarraco had told him that it was easy to approach the wall on foot at low tide. The tide was receding and strong wind made the lagoon even shallower. This opened a path to the walls for the Romans. Scipio took 500 men to the water. The ascend on this part of the wall was easy. There were no fortifications and no guards. The defenders were concentrating of the land side. The men entered the city without opposition and went to the gate where the fighting was. Caught by surprise the defenders gave up. The gate was battered from both sides and smashed. The soldiers marched to the forum. Some of the enemy went to a garrison hill to the east of the town and some went to the citadel. The hill was taken at the first assault. Mago then surrendered the citadel.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.41.1‚Äì2; 42; 43.1‚Äì2; 44‚Äì46.1‚Äì8 This victory was of great strategic importance. It shifted the theatre of war. Scipio broke out of the area the Romans had been confined to, took the war to enemy territory, and extended Roman control to an area close to valley of the River Baetis, which crossed southern Hispania. The Romans never fought on the east coast again. Scipio also captured the Carthaginian arsenal and treasure stored in the city. Eighty ships, 120 of the latest catapults and 281 smaller ones, 23 larger and 52 smaller ballistae (crossbow-like catapults), many larger and smaller scorpions (crossbows) and many other weapons were captured. So were large quantities of gold and silver; 63 merchant ships were seized in the harbour. Their cargo included grain, weapons, bronze, ship timber, linen and esparto (used to make ropes). Pursuing good relations with the locals, Scipio released the citizens of the town among the 10,000 free men captured and restored their property. The non-citizens and the slaves were recruited as oarsmen and 2,000 craftsmen were made public slaves, who would be freed if they made war equipment for the Romans.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.46.9‚Äì10; 47Richardson, J. S., Hispaniae, pp. 47‚Äì8 Scipio arranged for the hostages, which the Carthaginians had kept to bind tribes to themselves, to be collected by their relatives and friends. The wife of Mandonius and the daughters of Indibilis, the chief of the [Ilergetes], were among them. An example of Scipio's effort to establish good relations with the locals can be seen in the story of a young woman who had been captured. He learnt that she had been betrothed to Aluccius, a young Celtiberian noble. He sent for her parents and her betrothed. He told the latter that his beloved had been treated respectfully and that she had been reserved for him so that she could be given to him unviolated. In return, he asked him to be a friend of Rome. Aluccius replied that he could not make a return adequate to his feelings. The parents had brought a lot of gold for her ransom. When she was given freely they begged Scipio to accept it as a gift. Since they insisted, he gave it to Aluccius as a wedding present. Back home, Aluccius enlisted a body of his retainers and gave Scipio a picked force of 1,400 mounted men. Scipio sent Mago and 15 Carthaginian senators to Rome. When he returned to Tarraco, he called an assembly of the allies, new and old.Livy, The History of Rome, 26.49‚Äì50; 51-1-2, 9‚Äì11 In 209 BC, the command of Publius Cornelius Scipio and Marcus Junius Silanus was extended. Scipio continued to try to win over various tribes and restore those who received their hostages. Edeso, the chieftain of the Edetani (who lived in today's northern Valencia, just south of the Ebro), visited Scipio in Tarraco. His wife and sons were in Scipio's hands. He wanted to become the leader of the pro-Roman movement. He asked for his wife and children back and said that he was the first chief to come to him. The others, instead were still interacting with the Carthaginians while reaching out to the Romans. If Scipio accepted his friendship, the other tribes would follow suit to recover their hostages and make an alliance with Rome. Scipio agreed, and the tribes north of the Ebro, who had not been friendly with the Romans, now joined them. Indibilis and Mandonius, the chiefs of the Ilergetes whom Polybius described as \\"two of the greatest princes in Hispania\\", abandoned Hasdrubal's camp. They had been the most trustworthy Carthaginian allies. However, on the pretext that he mistrusted them, Hasdrubal demanded a large sum of money and their wives and children as hostages. Polybius noted that, after their victory over the Romans, the Carthaginians 'treated the natives in an overbearing manner and their subjects turned from friends to enemies'.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.7.17; 17.1‚Äì6Polybius, The Histories, 10.34; 35.1‚Äì3, 6‚Äì8; 36.2‚Äì4; 37.6‚Äì10; 38.1‚Äì5 Hasdrubal realised that he needed to make a bold move to stop the wastage. Scipio wanted to engage the Carthaginian commanders separately. He advanced against Hasdrubal. It was while he was en route that he was met by Indibilis and Mandonius. Scipio handed over the daughters of the latter and concluded a treaty with them. They shared the Roman camp and acted as guides until they reached the enemy.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.17.1‚Äì3 Polybius wrote that Hasdrubal had fallen out with the other Carthaginian commanders. This was one of his worries, along with the native desertions and the defection of Indibilis. He decided to meet the enemy in battle and if he lost he would retreat to Gaul, enlist as many natives as he could and go to Italy to join his brother Hannibal. He was encamped near the town of Baecula, in the area of [Castulo] (near today's Linares), a high mountain area at the head of the valley of the River Baetis, which crossed southern Hispania. This led to the Battle of Baecula. According to Polybius on hearing of the arrival of the Romans he moved his camp and placed it where his rear was protected by a river and his front by a ridge. He kept a covering force on the ridge. Scipio saw the advantageous position of the camp and waited for two days, but then he worried about the possible arrival of Mago and [Hasdrubal Gisgo] and took his chance. He sent the light infantry and a picked contingent of heavy infantry against the enemy force on the ridge. When Hasdrubal saw that these men were hard pressed, he led his men to the ridge. Scipio sent the whole of his light infantry in support. He led half of it, skirted the ridge to the left of the enemy and attacked. He ordered the rest to do the same on the right. Hasdrubal was still leading his men out of the camp. He had thought that the enemy would not attack his strong position and now, with this sudden attack, he deployed his troops too late. As his wings had not yet occupied their ground, the Roman wings succeeded in climbing the ridge. They fell on the enemy who was still getting into formation and forced them to flee. Hasdrubal took his war-chest and his elephants, gathered as many of the fugitives as he could and withdrew to the River Tagus and towards the pass of the Pyrenees he needed to cross into Gaul as originally intended.Polybius, The Histories, 10.37.1‚Äì4; 38.7‚Äì10; 39 Livy gave a different account of the battle. There were cavalry outposts before the enemy camp. Scipio sent a light-armed vanguard from the front of his column against them before choosing a site for his camp. The cavalry was forced back to their camp. Scipio pitched his camp. At night, Hasdrubal sent his troops to a hill that had a flat top, a river behind it, and a steep bank at the front and sides. Beneath it, a gently sloping lower area was surrounded by a ledge that was difficult to climb. The next day, the Romans lined up, and Hasdrubal sent the Numidian cavalry and light-armed Balearic and African troops to the lower plain. Scipio sent a contingent to hold the entrance of the river valley and another to block the road to the hill. He then set off towards the light infantry on the lowest brow of the hill with his light-armed men, who had routed the enemy outposts the day before. Despite being almost overwhelmed by a shower of javelins and stones and the difficulty of the ascent, he was the first to reach the top of the lower level and as soon as he reached level ground, he dislodged the light-armed enemy who were skirmishers and were unaccustomed to hand-to-hand fight. They were driven against the line on the higher level of the hill. Scipio divided his men, making a detour to the left and sending the rest, led by Laelius, round the right of the hill to find a less difficult ascent. He charged the enemy's right wing, throwing it into disorder before it could turn to face him. Meanwhile, Laelius reached the top on the other side. The elephants panicked. There was no space for a flight because the Romans blocked the roads and the camp gate was obstructed by the flight of Hasdrubal and his chief officers. The enemy was routed and lost 8,000 men.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.18 There is a chronological discrepancy between the two writers. Polybius placed these events in 208 BC, whereas Livy placed them in 209 BC. Livy said that he refused to think that Scipio remained idle in 209 BC. Both authors wrote than Scipio seized the camp and the prisoners were 10,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Livy added that he sent the native ones home and sold the African ones and that the native prisoners saluted him as king. Polybius wrote that it was the tribes in the area who were still Carthaginian allies and now came in to submit to the Romans who saluted him as a king. Both wrote that he said that he did not want to be called king and that he wanted to be called \\"imperator\\" (victorious commander). This shows that Scipio was held in high regard. According to Polybius, it was here that Edeco made his obeisance. Livy added that Scipio gave presents to the Hispanic chieftains and invited Indibilis to pick 300 of the captured horses. One of the African prisoners turned out to be the nephew of Masinissa, the commander of the Numidian cavalry troops allied with the Carthaginians and the son of the king of Numidia. Scipio allowed him to return to his uncle and gave him an escort.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.19Polybius, The Histories, 10.40.1‚Äì5, 10 Scipio considered that pursuing Hasdrubal was risky. Mago and the other Hasdrubal might join him. He sent a division to occupy the Pyrenees to observe the movements of Hasdrubal. According to Livy he spent the rest of the summer receiving the submission of the local tribes. According to Polybius the season was advanced had he went to Tarraco for the winter. The surviving fragments of Polybius on these events end here. In Livy a few days after the Battle of Baecula, when Scipio had descended from the pass of Castulo on his way to Tarraco, Hasdrubal Gisgo and Mago, came to join forces with Hasdrubal. They were too late. They held a council to discuss measures to continue the war. Hasdrubal Gisgo considered that the peoples along the distant southern coast of Hispania were unaware of the Roman victories and was still faithful to Carthage. The two men thought that moving their Hispanic troops to the further corner of Hispania or to Gaul would prevent the desertions caused by Scipio's generous treatment of the locals. Without waiting for approval by the Carthaginian senate they decided that Hasdrubal Barca must proceed to Italy, thus removing all the Hispanic soldiers out of Hispania and 'far beyond the spell of Scipio's name.' His army, weakened by losses and defections was to be brought back to full strength. Mago was to hand over his army to Hasdrubal Gisgo, and go the Balearic Isles to hire mercenaries there. Hasdrubal Gisgo was to go to Lusitania and avoid any collisions with the Romans. A selected force of 3,000 cavalry was to be assembled for Masinissa to cross western Hispania to assist the friendly tribes and ravage hostile territories. The three commanders left to execute their tasks.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.20.1‚Äì8Polybius, The Histories, 10.40.11‚Äì12 In Livy's chronology, it appears that there was no fighting in Hispania in 208 BC. The command of Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus was extended for one year and Scipio was ordered to send 50 of the 80 ships he either brought to Hispania of captured from Cartago Nova to Sardinia due to concerns about Carthage preparing naval attacks against Italy, Sicily and Sardinia. Livy resumed his account of events in Hispania by noting that the expedition of Hasdrubal shifted the burden of war to Italy and brought relief to Hispania. In 207 BC, \\"war was suddenly renewed in that country, which was quite as formidable as the previous one.\\" Hasdrubal Gisgo had withdrawn to Gades (Cadiz) by the Strait of Gibraltar and Scipio controlled the east coast. A new commander, Hanno, replaced Hasdrubal Barca and brought a fresh army from Africa. He marched to Celtiberia (in east-central Hispania, next to Roman territory) and raised a large army. Scipio sent Silanus with 10,000 infantry and 500 cavalry against him. His progress was hampered by bad roads and narrow mountain passes. Some Celtiberian deserters acted as guides and he found the location of the enemy. When he was ten miles away he was told that there were two camps along his road. The one on the left had 9,000 Celtiberians and the one on the right had the Carthaginians. The latter had outposts and the usual precautions. The former was undisciplined and poorly guarded. Silanus decided to attack the Celtiberians first and kept to the left to elude the Carthaginian outposts.Livy, The History of Rome, 22.27.7; 28.1 Silanus got three miles from the camp unnoticed. He stopped in a valley where he could not be seen, prepared for battle and advanced. The enemy was caught by surprise. Mago heard the shouts and went to take charge of this camp. The main Celtiberian strength were 4,000 men with shields and 200 cavalry. Mago placed them at the front and keep the rest, who were lightly armed, as reserve. He came out of the camp, but there was a shower of javelins when they had hardly crossed the rampart. The Celtiberians stopped to avoid them and threw theirs. The Romans overlapped their shields as protection and closed up, starting a sword-to-sword fight. The enemy found that their customary mobility and agility was useless on the uneven ground. The Romans, instead, were used to stationary combat and their only inconvenience was that their ranks were sometimes broken when moving through narrow places or patches of brushwood. There they had to fight singly or in pairs. However, these obstacles also obstructed the enemy's flight. When the Celtiberians were almost defeated, they were joined by the Carthaginian light infantry from the other camp. Both were defeated. Only 2,000 infantry and all the cavalry escaped with Mago almost at the beginning of the battle. Hanno, the second in command, was captured along with those who had joined the battle when it was almost over. Those who escaped reached Hasdrubal in the area of Gades (Cadiz). The newly recruited Celtiberians went back home. The victory stopped the Celtiberians from siding with Carthage. Scipio advanced into Baetica (the area of the River Baetis Guadalquivir, in southern Hispania) to confront Hasdrubal Gisgo who was encamped in that area to secure the loyalty of his allies. Because of Scipio's advance he went back to Gades and then distributed his forces to various towns for their protection.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.2,11, 14‚Äì16 When Scipio saw this, he sent his brother, Lucius Scipio, with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, to attack Orongi, a town of the Maessesses and the richest city in that area. Hasdrubal had used it as his base to make incursions on the inland tribes. Livy wrote that the Maessesses were a tribe of the Bastetani. However, this is doubtful.Different translators of Livy give different names for this town and the tribe it belonged to; others were Orinx and the Milesians and Orongis and the Mesesses. These are given as a tribe of the Bastetani, a people who lived on the south-eastern coast, close to Cartago Nova. The mention of silver mines places the town inland, close to the Sierra Morena. However, given the Bastetani's proximity to Cartago Nova, that the town was under Hasdrubal's control and that Scipio wanted to extend the area under his control, it would make more sense if the town was further west and the tribe in question would be the Mentesani, which belonged to the Oretani. Moreover, Castulo, which was near Baecula, where the Carthaginians had been defeated, was the capital of the Oretani Lucius Scipio encamped near the city and sent men to try to persuade the townsfolk to side with the Romans. This failed and he built a double line of circumvallation and formed his army into three divisions to rotate the military tasks. When the first division advanced there was a desperate fight. Lucius Scipio withdrew it and brought forward the other two. The townsfolk withdrew from the wall and the Carthaginian garrison, thinking that the town has been betrayed, formed a compact body. The townsfolk, fearing a massacre if the Romans broke through, opened one of the city gates, went out, held their shields in case of a javelin attack and showed their empty right hands to point out that they had no swords. This was misunderstood and they were attacked and cut down as though they were a hostile army. The Romans entered through the open gate and smashed the other ones. There was no bloodshed and no plundering. The enemy lost 2,000 men; the Romans lost 90. Publius Scipio considered the capture of Orongis as great an achievement as his own capture of Cartago Nova. With winter approaching, he withdrew from southern Hispania, sent the troops to winter quarters and his brother to Rome and wintered in Tarraco.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.3; 4.1‚Äì4 In 206 BC, Hasdrubal Gisgo, whom Livy described as 'the greatest and most brilliant commander who held command in this war' had moved from Gades to renew the war. He conducted levies with the help of Mago, the son of Hamilcar, and had 50,000 infantry and 4,500 cavalry. Livy noted that some of his sources wrote that he had 70,000 infantry. Hasdrubal and Mago encamped in a wide and open plain suitable for battle near a town that Livy called Silpia but Polybius called Ilipa, 10 miles north of Hispalis (Seville), and on the right bank of the River Baetis (Guadalquivir). Scipio felt that he could not face this large army without his native auxiliaries to give an appearance of greater strength, but he did not want to rely on them too much in case they changed sides like what happened to his uncle. Culchas, who had authority over 28 towns had promised a force of infantry and cavalry. Marcus Junius Silanus was sent to fetch them. Scipio marched from Tarraco to Castulo picking up small forces from the friendly tribes along the way. He was joined by Silanus there with Chulcas' 3,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. His entire army had 55,000 men. Livy wrote that Scipio advanced to meet the enemy and took up position near Beacula.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.12.13‚Äì15 Livy's writing gives the impression that the skirmishes that developed into a full battle that he described occurred at Baecula. However, this was not the case. In 28.12.14 Livy wrote that the Carthaginian commanders were encamped near Silpia (ilipa), which was is 130 miles further west. Livy did not mention a long march by these commanders. Therefore, there is no explanation as to why Mago and the Numidians (see below) would have attacked Scipio at Baecula. Moreover, he also wrote that the enemy encamped there on level ground, which was suitable for battle, whereas Baecula was not on level ground and was not suited for the kind of battle that followed. In the account of Polybius Scipio left Castulo with his whole army and \\"when he got near the Carthaginians and was in full sight of them he encamped on certain low hills opposite to the enemy.\\" There is no mention of Baecula. Thus, this must have been at Ilipa and what both authors described was the Battle of Ilipa. In Polybius, Scipio found his situation embarrassing because the allied troops he had were not enough for him to risk a battle and it seemed dangerous to 'rely on the support of the allies in what promised to be a decisive engagement.' He was forced by circumstances to employ the natives, whose role would be to impress the enemy, while the actual fighting would be down to his legions.Polybius, The Histories, 11.20.3‚Äì9The conventional and unchallenged identification of the site of the battle with Ilipa, Alcala del Rio, 14 km north of Seville near the north bank of the Baetis, is problematic. Hasdrubal could not have retreated to the sea after the battle from this side of the river because of the swamps, which cover a large area north of the mouth of this river. Richardson, J. S., Hispaniae, pp. 50‚Äì1 Livy wrote that while encamping, Scipio was attacked by Mago and Masinissa with the whole of their cavalry. Polybius specified that Mago thought it favourable to attack while the Romans were preparing their camp and that he would catch Scipio off guard. However, Scipio anticipated this and placed his cavalry, which was equal in numbers, under a hill. Caught by surprise, those who came close to the lines and attacked the parties digging the Roman entrenchments were routed. In Livy, the engagement with the other Carthaginians who were advancing in order was indecisive for a long time, while in Polybius the Carthaginian resistance was short. In Livy, the light infantry came out from the outposts and the entrenchment parties picked their weapons. More and more men came to relieve the wearied soldiers. The enemy withdrew in an orderly manner, but when they were pressed further they fled. Skirmishes between cavalry and light infantry on both sides to test each other's strength lasted for several days.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.13.6‚Äì10Polybius, The Histories, 11.21 After this, both sides lined up for battle in front of their camp until sunset and then returned to their camp. They repeated this for several days. As both sides had their own troops in the centre and the native auxiliaries on the wings Scipio thought that it was assumed that this would be the order of battle. Therefore, he changed the line-up for the day he intended to fight, placing the Romans on the wings. Polybius was more specific. He wrote that Scipio used two strategies, both consisted of acting in the opposite of the Carthaginians. One was a change of his line-up and the other was the timing of the battle. Hasdrubal repeatedly lined up the Africans in the centre to oppose the Romans and the Hispanics on the wings with the elephants in front of them. He drew up his men at a later hour. In the pre-battle moves Scipio had done the same. For the battle, instead, he drew up at dawn and lined up the Romans on the wings and the Hispanics in the centre. These two stratagems 'much contributed to the victory of his own army and the discomfiture of the enemy.' Scipio sent messages to his officers to have breakfast, get armed and march out of camp. In Livy, the messages were given the previous evening, in Polybius this happened as soon as it was light. Livy also mentioned the horses being fed, bitted and saddled and the cavalry got fully armed. Scipio sent out the cavalry and the light infantry. In Polybius, they got close to the enemy's camp and threw javelins. In Livy, they attacked the enemy's outposts. Scipio then advanced with the heavy infantry as the sun was rising. When he reached the middle of the plain he lined up his men in the mentioned opposite way round. The Carthaginians scarcely had the time to arm themselves, and had to deploy without preparation and without having had breakfast. In Livy, the enemy cavalry went out to respond to the Roman preliminary attack. In Polybius, the light infantry was also sent out. Then the heavy infantry was drawn up on level ground close to the foot of the hill in the usual order.Livy, The History of Rome, 14.1‚Äì12 The cavalry fight went on for some time without either side gaining the advantage. Both sides were in turn driven back, withdrew among their infantry and then resumed the attack. When the two infantry forces were half a mile from each other, Scipio recalled his cavalry and the infantry at the centre opened up passages to let them through. Scipio then divided them into two bodies, which he placed behind the wings as a reserve. It was time for the battle proper and he ordered the Hispanics in the centre to advance slowly. He extended the right wing he commanded to the right and got the left wing to extend the left. In other words, the wings were stretched outwards. They had three cohorts of infantry, three troops of cavalry and the light infantry. The light infantry and the cavalry were to engage the enemy before the two centres had time to get close. They were led at a rapid pace, while the centre followed them obliquely. The Roman line curved inwards towards the centre because of the slower advance of the Hispanic auxiliaries. By this time the wings were already engaged, the enemy centre with the main strength of the enemy, the veteran Carthaginians and Africans, had not yet come within range. It did not dare to leave their lines to help the wings for fear of being exposed to the advancing enemy centre. The allied wings of the Carthaginians were pressed by a pincer attack as the Roman cavalry and light infantry turned around and a made an attack on the flanks, while the heavy infantry was charging at the front, trying to detach them from the centre.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.14.13‚Äì18; 15.1‚Äì4 Polybius gave other details about Scipio's manoeuvres. The Roman infantry was inactive during the indecisive fight between the light infantry. Scipio then placed the light infantry behind the heavy infantry and in front of the horses. He made a direct frontal advance, but when at a distance of four stades (c. 630‚Äì700 m.) he ordered the centre to proceed at the same speed and got the right wing to turn right and the left wing to turn left. He advanced on the enemy wings with his wings at a rapid pace, moving them in the mentioned directions and with the light infantry in front followed by the cavalry and three maniples of heavy infantry. Meanwhile, the centre advanced in a straight line at a slower pace. When he got close he fell directly on the enemy wings. The two wings turned in the opposite directions, towards the enemy wings. After this the light infantry and the cavalry at the front of the right wing turned right and the heavy infantry at the rear turned left. The front was to outflank the enemy, while the rear was to attack frontally. On the left wing the front turned left and the rear turned right. As a result, the right of the front on both wings became their left. Scipio led the right wing and Lucius Marcius and Marcus Silanus led the left wing.Polybius, The Histories, 11.22.9‚Äì10; 23.1‚Äì8 The elephants were attacked by the missiles of the cavalry and harassed on their side by the light infantry. In distress, they caused as much damage to the Carthaginian wings as to the enemy, 'they destroyed all, friend or foe, who came in their way'. The infantry on the wings was broken. The centre was of no use because they could not leave their line to help the wings because of the advance of the native auxiliaries of the Romans. At the same time, they could not operate effectively in their position because the enemy in front of them would not engage. The wings kept up the fight for some time because the outcome of the battle depended on the fight on these two sides. As the day got hotter the Carthaginians grew faint as they had not been able to prepare themselves properly, while, at the same time, the best troops of the Romans were engaging the weaker troops of the enemy. The Carthaginians at first withdrew step by step, but then gave way in a body and withdrew to the foot of the hill and when the Romans renewed their pressure, they fled in rout to their camp. Then it started raining so heavily that the Romans had to make way to their camp with difficulty.Polybius, The Histories, 11.24 Only four fragments of Polybius' account of this battle have survived and the information we have from him ends here. Livy also wrote that the battle was not evenly matched due to the Hispanic auxiliaries of the Carthaginians having to fight against the Romans and the Latin allies. He added that as they days wore on, the strength of the Carthaginians begun to fail because they had not had a chance to have breakfast. Scipio had delayed the beginning of the battle proper for this reason. His charge started only after noon. The battle reached the centre considerably later, so that the noon heat, the strain of standing under arms, hunger and thirst weakened the Carthaginians and Africans before they started fighting. By then, the elephants had been put into a panic and the action of the light infantry had shifted from the wings to the centre. The weakened centre retreated, keeping their ranks. On seeing this, the Romans charged even harder on all sides. Hasdrubal tried to hold the line, but in the end his men fled up the hill behind them and then to their camp. The camp would have been taken had it not been for an extraordinary downpour. During the night, the Carthaginians raised their earthwork with the local stones. However, their allies began deserting, starting with Attenes, prince of the Turdetani, who lived along the south bank of the River Baetis. Two fortified towns were handed over to the Romans with their garrisons. Fears of more widespread desertions led Hasdrubal to move his camp the following night.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.15.4‚Äì16 Scipio sent his cavalry on the pursuit and followed with his army. They took a shorter route along the River Baetis on the advice of guides so that they could attack him if he tried to ford. Finding the river closed to him, Hasdrubal hurried towards the coast. The Roman cavalry and light infantry slowed him down, attacking the flank and rear of his army, forcing him to stop to repulse first the cavalry and then the light infantry until he fled to the nearest hills with 6,000 men, many of whom were unarmed. The rest were killed or captured. The Carthaginians hastily improvised an entrenchment at the top of the hill and the Romans did not attempt the steep ascent. However, the area was barren and unsuited to sustaining a siege. There were many desertions. Hasdrubal, who was not far from the coast, called for his ships and fled at night. Scipio left Marcus Silianus to continue the siege with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry and returned with the rest of his force to Tarraco. Along the way, he checked the disposition of the tribal chiefs so that they could be rewarded as they deserved. Masinissa came to a secret understanding with Marcus Silianus and went to Africa to induce his people to defect to Rome. He would remain loyal to Rome for the rest of his life. Hasdrubal sailed to Gades in the ships Mago had sent back for him, and the rest of the abandoned army broke up. Some went over to Rome and others dispersed among the nearby tribes. The Carthaginians were expelled from Hispania, Marcus Silianus went back to Scipio and reported that the end of the war.Livy, The History of Rome, 28.16 Scipio undertook a forced march from Tarraco to Cartago Nova. Then, he left for Africa to pursue an alliance with Syphax in preparation for a campaign against Carthage (in today's Tunisia). He left Marcus Silianus and Lucius Marcius in charge at Tarraco and Cartago Nova. After concluding a treaty, he returned to Cartago Nova. He felt that the time to punish Castulo and Iliturgi had arrived. They had defected to Carthage when the two Scipios died. The latter betrayed and put to death the fugitives from those Romans routs. Scipio sent Lucius Marcius with a third of the force to besiege Castulo and he marched on Iliturgi himself. He besieged the town. Attacks on the city walls were repeatedly repulsed, but the city eventually fell. Some African deserters, who were now serving with the Romans, saw that the highest part of the city, which was protected by steep cliffs, was left undefended and unfortified. They climbed the cliff using iron hooks as steps and entered the town, which the Romans had already seized. Resentment led to the massacre of everyone, including women and children. The town was set on fire and what was not burnt was destroyed. Scipio then went to Castulo, which was defended by Iberians from other places and the remnants of the Carthaginian army. There was discord between the Iberians and the Carthaginians. The commander of the latter betrayed the city and this prevented a slaughter.Livy, The History of Rome 28.17.12; 19.1‚Äì4, 15‚Äì18; 20 Lucius Marcius was sent to control those tribes that had not yet been subjugated. He crossed the River Baetis; two cities surrendered. However, Astapa was a Carthaginian ally, hated the Romans and carried out brigandage raids on the neighbours who were Roman allies and captured Romans traders. When the Romans got close, the townsfolk piled up their most precious possessions in a heap, got their wives and children to sit on top and put wood around them. Fifty men were put on their guard. Then they opened the gates and made a sortie. A few cavalry were sent against them and were routed. Then the Roman veterans charged, but the enemy was determined to die and did not give ground. The Romans extended their line and outflanked them. The townsfolk fought in a compact body and were all killed. In the town, the women and children were burnt by the guards who then threw themselves in the fire. After accepting the surrender of the remaining cities, Lucius Marcius returned to Cartago Nova. Deserters from Gades came and promised to betray the city, the Carthaginian garrison and the ships in the harbour. Mago had gathered a considerable force. Some were brought from Africa, across the strait, and some were brought by Hanno from the nearby tribes. Scipio sent Lucius Marcius with some light infantry contingents and Gaius Laelius with eight ships.Livy, The History of Rome 21‚Äì23.1‚Äì2, 6‚Äì8 Scipio fell ill and there were rumours that he had died. Mandonius and Indibilis called on their people to revolt, raised a Celtiberian force and ravaged the land of the Suessetani and Sedetani, who were Roman allies. There was a mutiny of Roman soldiers in a camp near Sucro (on today's River Jucar, south of Valencia). They were unhappy that they were still in Hispania even though the war had ended and demanded their pay. The soldiers gave the command of the camp to the chief ringleaders of the mutiny, two common soldiers. When confirmation of Scipio's death did not arrive the ringleaders were abandoned by their followers. Scipio sent seven officers to announce that he was alive and well. They told the soldiers that their demand for pay was reasonable and that they would put it to Scipio, who sent collectors among the tributary tribes to raise the money for this. Scipio then summoned the soldiers to New Carthage to receive the pay. The ringleaders were executed and the soldiers were reprimanded and then given their pay.Livy, The History of Rome 28.24‚Äì26; 29.10‚Äì12 In the meantime, Lucius Marcius defeated Hanno, Mago's prefect, who had been sent from Gades (Cadiz) with a small force of Africans to hire local mercenaries and had armed 4,000 young men. Hanno escaped. Gaius Laelius' ships reached Carteia, in the Bay of Gibraltar. Some men offered to surrender Gades, but the plot was discovered and Mago arrested them and sent them to Carthage in a convoy of ships. When this passed the Strait of Gibraltar Laelius pursued it. There was a battle made chaotic by the current. Four Carthaginians ships were sunk and five fled to Africa. Back onshore, Laelius learnt that the plot had been discovered. He and Lucius Marcius agreed that they were wasting time and returned to Cartago Nova. Mago sent news of the mutiny of the Roman camp and the Illergete revolt to Carthage and urged for aid to be sent for the re-conquest of Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome 28.30 Mandonius and Indibilis, who had withdrawn, resumed hostilities with 20,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry and attacked Sedetania. Scipio marched on them and he got near their camp, which was in a narrow valley. He sent some cattle towards it and hid the cavalry behind a mountain spur. It was to charge when the light infantry engaged the enemy in a skirmish. The enemy rushed to seize the cattle. There was some skirmishing and when a sword fight started the cavalry came in. It made a frontal attack and some cavalrymen went round the foot of the mountain to cut off the retreat of the enemy. There was more slaughter than usual for a skirmish. The next day the enemy lined up for battle at dawn. Due to the valley being narrow part of their men were on the slope of a hill, rather than in the plain. Fighting on a narrow front was more adapted to Roman tactics. The enemy line could not fight at full strength and their cavalry was rendered useless. The Roman cavalry was sent to make a detour around the hill because it had no room to outflank the enemy. Scipio quickly led the charge of the infantry so that the manoeuvre would not be noticed. The cavalry reached the enemy's rear and there were two separate fights because the narrowness of the valley prevented a link up. The Roman infantry routed the enemy infantry, which could not rely on the support of its cavalry. The enemy was slaughtered and only the troops on the hill, which had not fought, managed to escape. The Romans lost 2,000 men and 3,000 were wounded; 3,000 of the enemy were seized. Indibilis begged for clemency and pleaded loyalty if he was spared a second time. Scipio replied that he would spare him, but that if he revolted again he would 'feel the weight of his arm'. He imposed an indemnity to pay his troops.Livy, The History of Rome 28.31.5‚Äì7; 33; 34.1‚Äì11 Scipio sent Marcus Silianus to Tarraco and Lucius Marcius to southern Hispania. He then joined the latter as he was approaching the coast. Scipio wanted to go to Gades to meet Masinissa and conclude an alliance with him. Lucius Marcius informed Masinissa that Scipio was coming. Masinissa persuaded Mago to let him go to the mainland to for some plundering (at that time Cadiz was on an island). When the two men met Masinissa thanked Scipio for sending his nephew back home and pledged his help if Rome sent Scipio to Africa. He thought that if he did Carthage would be defeated. Scipio then returned to Tarraco. Mago lost all hope for Hispania and was preparing to leave. He received orders from Carthage to take his fleet in Gades to Italy, raise an army and assist Hannibal there. Sailing along the coast he landed a force near Cartago Nova and plundered the nearest fields. Then he took his fleet to the city, thinking that it was held only by a small Roman garrison and hoping for the support of the townsfolk. He attacked the city wall. The city gate was opened and the Romans burst out. Thrown into confusion, the enemy fled, was pursued to the shore and suffered heavy losses. They were rescued by the ships. Those who tried to swim to the ships could not see them and drowned. When Mago returned to Gades the city gates were closed to him. He anchored nearby and complained. He was told that the townsfolk had done this because they were angry about the pillaging by the soldiers when they embarked. Mago summoned the town officials, who were executed. Then he went to the Balearic Islands to winter there. He was repulsed by the inhabitants of the bigger island. He went on to the smaller island, which did not have strong defences, and wintered there.Livy, The History of Rome 28.34.12; 35.1‚Äì4, 9‚Äì12; 36.1‚Äì2, 4‚Äì12; 37  The wars of resistance against Rome  = From commanders with consular power to praetors as provincial governors = When Scipio Africanus returned to Rome after his victory in 206 BC, he recommended that the Roman army should remain in Hispania to prevent a return of the Carthaginians during the rest of the Second Punic War. He had made alliances with local tribes and Rome had the obligation to protect them. However, these alliances could be weak and the allies could be untrustworthy and unpredictable, as the rebellion by Indibilis had shown (see above). Therefore, the continuation of Roman military presence was needed. After the end of this war, the Romans decided to remain in Hispania rather than withdraw. The actions Scipio Africanus had taken had laid the foundation for this permanent presence. He had established permanent garrisons at Tarraco (Tarragona), Cartago Nova (Cartagena) and Gades (Cadiz). He had founded the colony (settlement) of Italica (near Santiponce) to settle wounded Roman veterans. He also changed the Roman army in Hispania from one financed by Rome to a self- sufficient army. He did this through war booty and collections of food, clothes, and other supplies from the local tribes that had rebelled against the Romans. He also had grain collected for export to raise money to pay soldiers, and requisitioned food and clothing for the soldiers. There must also have been steps to encourage some areas of Hispania to produce grain for the Romans. Livy mentioned that when Scipio Africanus campaigned in Africa a few years later (at the end of the Second Punic War), grain from Sicily and Sardinia (which were major producers of grain), but also from Hispania was sent to the Roman troops there.Livy, The History of Rome, 30.3.2 Probably some farming areas were oriented towards producing crops to be exported to Rome, particularly in the fertile valleys of the rivers Ebro (in the northern part of the east coast) and Baetis (Guadalquivir) in the south. The presence of Roman soldiers and traders must have started the process of Romanisation. New products and technological innovations were imported. Initially the mentioned requisitions occurred in an ad hoc manner. Later they were extended to all tribes in Roman territory and developed into a form of taxation. The three Scipios who led the Roman campaigns in Hispania had conducted affairs independently for Rome, following the exigencies of war. For seven years, Rome sent military commanders with an irregular constitutional position to Hispania (see next paragraph). When governors, ostensibly under the supervision of the Roman senate, were instituted, the senate had little control over them due to the great distance. Hispania remained governed largely independently by the men on the spot. This left Hispania in the hands of governors and officials who were inexperienced due to lack of knowledge of the provinces and their local people and to the shot duration of their offices. It led to abuses, exploitation, and harassment of the local peoples. The senate tried to address this, but failed. The largely unsupervised Roman officials and entrepreneurs became greedy as local resources provided opportunities for enrichment. This was a breeding ground for discontent and rebellion.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, pp. 23‚Äì24, 28‚Äì29 In 205 BC, after Scipio Africanus returned to Rome, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus were sent to Hispania with proconsular power \\"without magistracy\\" (\\"sine magistratus\\", without holding public office). This was a constitutional oddity.Richardson, J. S., Hispaniae, Spain and the development of Roman Imperialism, 218‚Äì82 BC, pp. 64‚Äì71 Normal governors of Roman territories were either praetors, propraetors or proconsuls. The latter were praetors or consuls who were assigned a governorship after their year in office and/or whose imperium (the power to command an army) was extended ‚Äì the offices of the consuls and praetors conferred the power to command an army. Therefore, Lentulus and Acudinus were sent to Hispania without holding the usual public office, but they were given proconsular power so that they could command the armies in Hispania. This gave the Roman territory in Hispania a somewhat unofficial status. The two men had just the status of military commanders. The manner of their appointment in not known. This constitutional oddity continued for seven years, until 197 BC, when two provinces were created in Hispania and they were assigned to two praetors as per normal procedure. It looks like Rome may have improvised when she retained this new territory and that the status and form of administration was regularised after seven years. Cornelius Lentulus and Manlius Acidinus stayed in Hispania for an unusually long time. Livy wrote that their command was extended in 202 BC.Livy, The History of Rome, 30.2.7 He does not mention what the arrangements for the previous extra two years were. Probably the two men were sent without a clear term of stay and this was looked into when they had been there or quite a while. In 201 BC, the question of who should take their place was put to the assembly of the people. This was an unusual procedure and was probably a way to give a mandate to people being sent to Hispania without (elected) public office. The reason why this irregular system was continued is not known either. They were to be replaced by only one man, who was to take a legion and 15 cohorts there. The outgoing proconsuls were to bring back home the veterans who had spent a long time in Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome, 30.41.4; Livy did not say what the outcome of the vote was. Only Lentulus went back to Rome. He arrived in 200 BC.Livy, The History of Rome, 31.20; In a later passage, Livy wrote that in 200 BC Gaius Cornelius Cathegus was a propraetor in Hispania and defeated a hostile force in the territory of the Sedetani and 15,000 of the enemy died.Livy, The History of Rome, 31.49.7 The question of the replacement for Acidinus was put to the assembly of the people in 200 BC. Gnaeus Cornelius Blasio and Lucius Titus Stertinius were chosen and were sent to Hispania in 199 BC. Acidinus returned to Rome in 199 BC.Livy, The History of Rome, 31.50.11; 32.7.4 The idea of having only one man in charge in Hispania might have been connected with the fact that Hannibal had been defeated the year before and with the end of the Second Punic War there was a need to demobilise the Roman armies (particularly in Italy) and discharge the veterans. In 199 BC, the praetor Gaius Sergius was given the task of organising the distribution of land to the soldiers who had served for many years in Sicily, and Sardinia and Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome, 32.1.6 We are not told why this plan to have only one man in charge did not materialise and why Acidinus stayed behind. Also in 199 BC, the people of the city of Gades (Cadiz) in Hispania asked that no prefect should be sent to their town and this was granted (in 206 BC, the Romans had concluded a treaty with Gades in which it was agreed that a Roman centurion was to act as Roman prefect in the town). In 198 BC, the number of Roman praetors was increased from four to six because it was decided to create two new provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. The two capitals were Tarraco (Tarragona) and Curdoba (C√≥rdoba). They were to be headed by praetors and the praetors for 197 BC, Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus and Marcus Helvius, were sent to Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. They were given 8,000 Latin infantry and 400 cavalry each to replace the old soldiers, who were sent back home. They were also given the task of defining the border between the two provinces.Livy, The History of Rome, 32.28.2, 11 Trouble developed as there was a large-scale warlike movement. Late in the year, war broke out in Hispania Ulterior. Helvius informed Rome about two simultaneous but independent rebellions by two chiefs in the area of the River Baetis (Guadalquivir), Culchas and Luxinius. The former was supported by 15 fortified cities and the latter by was supported by two strong cities, Carmo (Carmona) and Bardo, the Malacini and the Sexetani (form the coast in the southeast) and Baeturia (an area between the rivers Baetis and Guadiana). Other peoples had not yet disclosed their intentions, but would soon join the revolt. The senate did not take any immediate action and instead decided to get the new praetors to ask for instructions after they were elected in the forthcoming elections.Livy, The history of Rome, 33.19.7; 33.21.6‚Äì9 At the end of the year, soon after the elections of the new consuls and praetors, news arrived that the army of Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus had been routed in Hispania Citerior and that the praetor had been mortally wounded.Livy, The History of Rome, 33.25.8‚Äì9 There is no record of what happened in Hispania Ulterior. In 196 BC, Hispania Ulterior was assigned to Quintus Fabius Buteo and Hispania Citerior to Quintus Minucius Thermus. They were given one legion each and 4,000 infantry and 300 cavalry each from the Latin allies. They and ordered to leave as soon as possible. Quintus Minucius won a battle against the commanders Budares and Baesadines in which 12,000 of the enemy were killed and Budares was captured.Livy, The History of Rome, 33.26.1‚Äì4; 44.4‚Äì5 At the same time, Gnaeus Cornelius Blasio and Lucius Stertinius (the two men who were proconsuls in Hispania in 198 BC) returned from Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. The former was granted an ovation (a minor victory celebration) and brought large amounts of silver and gold from the proceeds from the spoils of war. The latter did not ask for a triumph, gave a large amount of silver from his booty to the treasury and used the rest to erect two arches with guided statues.Livy, The History of Rome, 27.1‚Äì4 We do not have any details about the military engagements of these two men. = The campaign of Marcus Portius Cato (the Elder) = At the end of 196 BC, it was decided that, with war in Hispania raging, a consul with a consular army of two legions plus 15,000 Latin infantry and 800 cavalry transported by 20 ships was needed. Hispania was assigned to Marcus Porcius Cato (the Elder). The praetors Appius Claudius Nero and Publius Manlius were given Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively and the latter was to be an assistant to the consul. They were allowed to levy 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry each to add to the legion each of their predecessors had in Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome, 33.43.2‚Äì3, 5, 7‚Äì8 A dispatch arrived from Quintus Minucius Thermus, the praetor in Hispania Citerior, announcing that he had defeated the enemy commanders Budar and Baesadines near the city of Turda,Turda is thought by some scholars to have been was the legendary city of Tartessos at the mouth of the River Baetis, while others think that it had been the name for Andalusia. Before historical times, its population (the Turboletae) either disappeared or was assimilated as their lands were divided between the Bastetani and Edetani that the former had been captured and that the enemy had lost 12,000 men.Livy, The History of Rome, 33.44.4 We have no record of what happened in Hispania Citerior in 196 BC. In 195 BC, Cato sailed to Rhoda (modern Rosas, by the Pyrenees) a port of the Massiliote (the people of the Greek city of Massalia, Marseille, who were friends of Rome) and expelled the Hispanic garrison that held the fort. He then landed at Emporiae (or Ampurias, an ancient town nearby), a port where there were two settlements, one of (friendly) Greeks, and one of locals. He stayed there for three days to gather intelligence and to start drilling his troops He sent the redemptores (Roman merchants who followed the army) back to Rome, saying that 'war feeds itself' and on leaving Emporiae he pillaged the enemy's fields at a time when the grain was ready for threshing and spread \\"terror and flight in all directions\\".Livy, The History of Rome, 34.8.6‚Äì7, 9.1‚Äì3, 10‚Äì13 Meanwhile, Marcus Helvius, the praetor of Hispania Ulterior for 198 BC, was on his way from that province to Cato's camp with an escort of 6,000 men sent by Appius Claudius Nero (the praetor of that province for that year, 195 BC). He had remained in Hispania after handing over his praetorship of that province to Quintus Minucius Thermus in 196 BC because of a 'long and dangerous illness'. Along the way he came across and defeated a large force of 20,000 Celtiberians near an unspecified town of Iliturgi. The enemy lost 12,000 men, the town was seized and all the adult males were killed. Marcus Helvius then reached Cato's camp, sent the escort back to Hispania Ulterior and returned to Rome only two months after the return of his successor (Quintus Minucius). He was granted an ovation (a minor victory celebration) instead of a triumph (a full scale celebration) because he had fought under another commander's jurisdiction and returned to Rome two years after the expiry of his tenure in office. He brought back significant amounts of silver coins and uncoined silver. Quintus Minucius celebrated a triumph and brought back much larger amounts of silver coins and uncoined silver.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.10 The Ilergetes, in the north of Hispania Citerior, a loyal tribe, was under attack. They sent three envoys to ask for Roman help. Cato did not want to split his army to come to their help because an enemy force was near and a battle was impending. Since the envoys were distraught, he told them that he would help them and pretended to embark 3,000 soldiers for this. The ambassadors were satisfied and left. Cato disembarked his men and went into winter quarters three miles from Emporiae. He sent his troops to plunder the enemy's fields, marching them at night so as to cover as much distance as possible and to catch the enemy by surprise at dawn. This was to harden his freshly levied men. The enemy did not dare to venture out of their fortifications.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.11-1-4; 12-5-12; 13.1‚Äì3 Cato then decided to engage the enemy's camp, setting off at midnight, again to catch the enemy by surprise. He went round the rear of the camp, lined up his men at dawn and sent three contingents to the camp's rampart. The enemy was surprised that the Romans were behind their line. Cato ordered the contingents to withdraw to draw the enemy out of their camp on the chase. It worked, and as they were forming ranks Cato deployed the cavalry from the wings. However, those of the right wing were repulsed and their retreat created panic in the infantry. Cato ordered two picked contingents to go round the enemy's right so that they showed up at their rear before the infantry became engaged. This made the battle more even because the enemy had to watch their rear as well. Still, the infantry and cavalry of the right wing became so dispirited that they started withdrawing, making it difficult for the Romans to hold their line. The left wing pressed the enemy back and the contingents at their rear were causing panic. A sword-to-sword fight started. As the troops were getting tired, Cato called in the reserve and the front was reformed. The enemy line was broken and they fled towards their camp. Cato now engaged the second legion. The Romans could not reach the rampant due to stones and javelins being thrown at them. Cato saw that the left gate of the camp was thinly defended and sent the second legion there. It broke through and may of the enemy were killed.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.14‚Äì15 After the battle, Cato allowed his men a few hours' rest and then he despoiled the fields in the area, which forced the settlement of locals in Emporiae and those who had sought refuge there to surrender. Cato allowed them to return home and then set off for Tarraco (Tarragona). All the communities along the way surrendered and by the time he got there all of Hispania north of the River Ebro was subjugated. However, there were false rumours that he wanted to march on TurdetaniaThere were two areas with this name. one was near Saguntum. The other, more important, area was on the southwestern coast, in the other province. and that he was already on his way spread among the tribes of the mountains. Seven forts of the Bergistani (who lived in the north of Hispania Citerior) revolted. They were reduced to submission without any serious fighting. Cato returned to Tarraco, but they rebelled again and this time, when he defeated them again, he sold all into slavery to discourage further rebellion.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.16 Meanwhile, the praetor Publius Manlius marched into Turdetania with the army he had taken over from Quintus Minucius, joining it with the force the other praetor, Appius Claudius Nero, had in Hispania Ulterior. The reason why Manlius, who had been sent to Hispania Citerior as consular assistant, should campaign in Hispania Ulterior and also take the command of the troops of the praetor of the other province in unclear. Moreover, the mentioned rumour of an attack on Turdetania by the Romans may not have been unfounded, and there may have been a mistake about who was going to lead it and which of the two Turdetanias (see note 78) to attack. The Turdetani were considered the least warlike tribe, and were easily defeated. However, they hired 10,000 Celtiberian mercenaries. Meanwhile, Cato, worried by the rising of the Bergistani and possible uprisings by other tribes, disarmed the all the peoples north the Ebro. This caused resentment. He levelled the walls of all the cities in a day. All but one (Segestica, which was taken by storm) surrendered. Publius Manlius, who was having a hard time with the Celtiberian mercenaries, asked Cato for help. Cato found that the Turdetani and the Celtiberians were in separate camps. The patrols of the former were defeated in skirmishes. Cato then sent three officers to the Celtiberians to offer them three choices: to receive double pay form the Romans, to return home with the guarantee of no reprisals, or to set a date and place for a battle. The Celtiberians could not decide. Cato sent contingents to plunder the fields of an area that had not yet been attacked. Next he marched to Segestia (Siguenza) because he heard that the baggage of the Celtiberians had been left there. As the Celtiberians still did not move he returned with an escort to the Ebro, leaving he whole of his army in the praetor's camp.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.17, 19 Cato captured several towns with his small force. The Sedetani, Ausetani, and Suessetani near the River Ebro went over to him. The Lancetani, fearing retribution by the tribes they had raided while Cato was away remained in arms. Due to this behaviour, Cato attacked them. He stopped his men just less than half a mile from one of their towns. He left some contingents to guard the camp and advanced with the rest around the other side of the town. He sent his native auxiliaries who were mostly Suessetani (now allies), to advance to the city walls. When the Lancetani recognised them and, remembering that they had often raided their fields, they opened the city gates and rushed against them. Cato entered the city with his force through the open gate, which the enemy had forgotten to close. The Lancetani had to surrender.Livy, The History of Rome, p. 34.20 Cato then went to the town of Vergium, which was a haunt for brigands who raided peaceful districts. The town leader, Vergestanus, disavowed any complicity with them. The brigands had made themselves masters of the town. Cato told him to return to the town, make up an excuse for his absence and then seize the citadel while the Romans were keeping the brigands busy with their attack. The brigands found themselves with the double threat of the Roman attack and the capture of the citadel. Cato seized the city and ordered that the people in the citadel and their relatives were to be set free and retain their property. The rest of the townsfolk were sold into slavery. The brigands were executed. After pacifying the province, Cato organised the operation of the iron and silver mines efficiently. This produced considerable revenue and made the province richer. He then went back to Rome.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.21.1‚Äì8 = Continuation of the resistance = Cato claimed that he had pacified Hispania. Yet, the year after he went back to Rome there were more serious rebellions. Thus, reality on the ground was different, and, due to Hispania being far away, the senate could be badly informed about the situation there. Cato's actions actually sowed the seeds for further rebellion. His heavy handedness was resented. Moreover, he further promoted agricultural production to supply the Roman army. This transformed some of the tribes in the Roman territories from pastoral and nomadic or semi nomadic societies into settled agricultural ones. Many young people who lost their traditional warrior lifestyle became mercenaries, auxiliary soldiers for the Roman army, bandits or rebels. Outside Roman territory there were fears about possible Roman encroachment inland. This was fertile ground for rebellions.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitianians Resistance to Rome, 42 In 194 BC, the praetors Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica and Sextus Digitus were assigned Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. Sextus Digitus \\"fought battles, numerous rather than memorable, with the tribes who had, in great numbers, revolted after the departure of Marcus Cato.\\" He lost half of his army. All of Hispania would have rebelled had not Scipio Nasica won many battles south of the River Ebro, resulting in the surrender of 50 towns. He fell upon a large gang of Lusitanian bandits who were on their way back home from plundering Hispania Ulterior carrying their booty. This was near the city of Ilipa (Alcala del Rio, near Seville). His fresh and compact force fought against a long column that was hindered by many pack animals, and was tired from a long march. At first, the Lusitanians threw the Romans into confusion. Then the battle became more even, and eventually, the Romans won and pursued the fugitives. The Lusitanians lost 12,000 men and 140 men, mainly cavalrymen, were captured. The Romans lost 73 men.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.43.7; 35.1 In 193 BC, the praetors Gaius Flaminius and Marcus Fulvius Nobilitor were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. Gaius Flaminius was a veteran who had fought in Hispania during the Second Punic War.Livy, The History of Rome, 34.55.6 Because of the events of the previous year some friends told Gaius Flaminius that a great war had flared up in Hispania. He had little confidence in the troops of Sextus Digitus and asked the senate to give him a legion from Rome to supplement the scared remnant of this army in addition to the force he had been allowed to levy. This would have given him a total of 6,200 infantry and 300 cavalry, which he thought sufficient to carry on the campaign. The senate refused, saying that it could not pass decrees on the basis of rumours invented by private individuals to gratify officials. It would accept only reports from officers in Hispania. It added that in case of an emergency in Hispania he should raise emergency troops outside Italy. Gaius Flaminius sailed to Sicily to conduct a levy. Then, on his way to Hispania, a storm carried him to Africa and he recruited veterans who had settled there after the Second Punic War. He added a contingent in Hispania to the two from Sicily and Africa. When he arrived in Hispania he found that the report had been an exaggeration. For unknown reasons he seized the Oretani city of Inlucia. The Oretani lived in today's region of La Mancha (in south central Spain) and the eastern part of the Sierra Morena, outside Roman territory. He then took his troops to their winter stations. During the winter he fought several battles against raiding parties of brigands. Livy thought that they were unworthy of record and that Marcus Fulvius did greater things.Livy, The History of Rome, 35.2.3‚Äì6. 35.7.6‚Äì7 Marcus Fulvius Nobilitor undertook a campaign against an alliance of Vaccaei (from the northwest of central Hispania), Vettones (from west-central Hispania) and Celtiberians near Toletum (Toledo, in central Hispania), which was 200 km (125 miles) north of his province. He must have left the Baetis (Guadalquivir) Valley and crossed the Sierra Morena. He routed the armies of these tribes and captured alive Hilernus. Livy said that he was their king.Livy, The History of Rome, 35.7.6‚Äì8 However, it is highly unlikely that the three peoples had a common king. In 192 BC, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus and Aulus Atilius Serranus were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. However, they were reassigned to the command of Bruttium (Calabria, the toe of Italy) and of the fleet in Greece respectively. Gaius Flaminus and Marcus Fulvius Nobilitor retained their posts. The two praetors fought in the right praetorial order, Gaius Flaminius took the wealthy Vaccaei city of Licabrum by storm and captured the chief Conribilo alive. Fulvius Nobilitor won two battles and seized the towns of Vescelia (Vilches) and Helo and many forts, while others surrendered voluntarily. He then marched on the Oretani (in the southeast of central Hispania) and seized Noliba and Cusibis. Several other towns surrendered. After this he then advanced to River Tagus and attacked Toletum (Toledo). The Vettones sent a large army to relive it but he routed them and captured the city.Livy, The History of Rome, 35.22.5‚Äì8 In 191 BC, the term Gaius Flaminius was extended and Lucius Aemilius Paulus replaced Marcus Fulvius Nobilitor in Hispania Ulterior. The two praetors were to serve for two years because the war in Greece against Antiochus III had begun. They were allowed to have additional fresh troops, 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, and two-thirds of these were to be Latin allies. Lucius Aemilius lost a battle against the Lusitanians in the territory of the Vastitani at the town of Lycon (location unknown). He found it difficult to defend his camp and lost 6,000 men. He retreated by forced march to a friendly country. He raised an army by a hasty levy (probably an irregular force) and fought a pitched battle against the Lusitanians. They were routed; they lost 18,000 men and 3,300 were captured. This 'made matters more tranquil' in Hispania.Livy, The History of Rome, 36.2.8‚Äì9; 37.46.7‚Äì9; 37.57.8‚Äì11 We know through an inscription that Lucius Aemilius besieged the city of Hasta (a town in Turdetania, near Jerez de la Frontera). Facing stiff resistance, he encouraged a revolt of the slaves of the city, decreeing that they would be freed and given the land they worked on if they revolted. It worked, the city was delivered to him and he kept his promise. We know this through an inscription found near Alcala del los Gazules, 80 km east of Cadiz.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitianians Resistance to Rome, 45, 259 n. 199 In 189 BC, Publius Junius Brutus and Lucius Plautius Hypsaeus were the praetors of Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. Publius Iunius was reassigned from Etruria to Hispania when Lucius Baebius Dives (who had been assigned to Hispania Ulterior) died in Massalia (Marseilles) on his way to Hispania when he was attacked by Ligurians. Lucius Baebius had been given reinforcements of 6,000 Latin infantry and 200 cavalry. Lucius Plautius Hypsaeus was given 2,000 Roman and 2,000 Latin infantry and 200 cavalry. The two men were surprised to find the situation quiet in Hispania. Lucius Aemilius' victory brought temporary peace.Livy, The History of Rome, 37.50.11‚Äì12; 37.57.1‚Äì6 In 188 BC, Lucius Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus and Gaius Atinius were the praetors of Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. They were given more troops; 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry were added to each provincial legion. Initially, things were quiet, but in 187 BC, the two praetors informed Rome that Celtiberians and Lusitanians were in arms and were ravaging the lands of the allies. Gaius Atinius fought the Lusitanians near Hasta, defeated them, killing 6,000 of them, and seized their camp. He then attacked Hasta, which he seized easily. However, he died in the battle. The senate sent a messenger to order Gaius Calpurnius Piso, his successor, to hasten his departure. However, he had already left two days earlier. The other praetor, Lucius Manlius Acidinus fought an indecisive battle against the Celtiberians. Both sides withdrew and the Celtiberians moved their camp the next night, giving the Romans the chance to bury their dead and collect the spoil. A few days later, the Celtiberians returned with a larger army and engaged the Romans near the town of Calagurris (Today's Calahorra in La Rioja, northern Hispania). They were defeated, suffering 12,000 casualties and 2,000 were captured. Livy noted that his sources did not explain why the Celtiberians who had an enlarged army were the weaker side. He also wrote that had not the arrival of Acidinus' successor prevented him from taking advantage of his success, the Celtiberians might have been subdued.Livy, The History of Rome, 38.35.10; 39.7.1; 39.21 In 186 BC, the praetors Gaius Calpurnius Piso (Hispania Ulterior) and Lucius Quinctius Crispinus (Hispania Citerior) were given reinforcements consisting of 20,000 Latin and 3,000 Roman infantry and 800 Latin and 200 Roman cavalry. They conducted a common campaign. They joined their forces in Baeturia and marched into Carpetania, where the enemy camp was. Between the towns of Dipo and Toletum, a fight broke out between foraging parties and developed into a full battle. Being familiar with the ground and knowing the enemy tactics, the enemy routed the Romans, who lost 5,000 men. However, they did not keep up the pressure. The praetors left their camp the following night. At dawn the enemy approached the rampant and were surprised that it was empty. They remained in their camp for the next few days. Then they moved to the River Tagus. Meanwhile, the praetors, who had gathered auxiliaries from the allied Hispanic towns, encamped twelve miles from this river. Then they marched to the river banks at night. At dawn they saw an enemy fort on a hilltop on the other side of the river. They found two fords, split the army into two and crossed the river. The enemy watched them. They marvelled at their sudden appearance and discussed how to throw them in confusion while they were crossing. Meanwhile, the Romans brought over all their baggage, gathered in one place and, as they had no time to set up camp, lined up for battle. They had two legions. The fight was most intense in the centre and when the enemy saw that it could not be broken it formed a wedge formation. Gaius Calpurnius made a short detour with the cavalry and attacked the flank of the wedge. The allied cavalry attacked the other flank. The praetor rode so deep into the enemy ranks that it was difficult to distinguish which side he belonged to. His courage fired up both the cavalry and the infantry. The enemy was broken. The cavalry pursued the fugitives and a battle with the guard of the enemy camp started. The Cavalry had to dismount and fight on foot. The reserve infantry was called in to help. Only a few thousand out of a force of 35,000 escaped. The Romans lost 600 of their men and 150 auxiliaries.Livy, The History of Rome, 39.8.2; 39.20.3‚Äì4; 39.30; 39.31 In 184 BC, the praetor Aulus Ternentius Varro and Publius Sempronius Longo were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. Hispania Ulterior was quiet during the tenure of Longus due to the successful campaign of the previous year. However, during his second year he was incapacitated by illness and died.Livy, The History of Rome, 39.42.1; 39.56.2; 40.2.6 In Hispania Citerior Varro seized the Suessetani town of Corbio (near Sanguesa, Navarre), north of the River Ebro, and sold the prisoners. The province remained quiet in the winter. In 183 BC, the two provinces in Hispania were reserved for the current praetors. In that year Aulus Terentius took on successful actions against the Celtiberians near the Ebro, in Ausetanian territory (in the north-eastern corner of Hispania). He took by storm several places the Celtiberians had fortified. Hispania Ulterior was quiet due to the long illness of Publius Sempronius.Livy, The History of Rome, 39.42.1; 39.45.3; 39.56.1‚Äì2 In 182 BC, the praetors Publius Manlius (who had been Cato's second-in-command in 195 BC) and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus were assigned Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. In Rome it was known that in Hispania Citerior there was war with the Celtiberians and that the army in Hispania Ulterior has lost military discipline due to the idleness caused by the long illness of Publius Sempronius. The reinforcements for the two provinces were 4,000 Roman and 7,000 allied infantry and 200 Roman and 300 allied cavalry. Aulus Terentius sent news that Publius Sempronius had died after more than a year's illness. The new praetors were ordered to leave as soon as possible.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.1.2, 4.7; 40.2.5 The Celtiberians attacked Fulvius Flaccus while he was besieging the town of Urbicua (probably in the modern province of Cuenca or the province of Guadalajara). The Romans suffered casualties in a number of hard battles. The praetor persevered. The Celtiberians, exhausted by many battles, withdrew and the town fell a few days later. He then went to winter camp. Publius Manlius did the same having done, according to Livy, nothing worth mentioning.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.16.8‚Äì10  First Celtiberian War (181‚Äì179 BC)  In 181 BC, The command of the praetors of the previous year, Publius Manlius (who had been Cato's second-in-command in 195 BC) and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was extended. They had been assigned Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. They received reinforcements of 3,000 Roman and 6,000 allied infantry and 200 Roman and 300 allied cavalry. A serious war broke out in Hispania Citerior. The Celtiberians gathered 35,000 men. Livy wrote: 'hardly ever before had they raised so large a force'. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus drew as many auxiliary troops form the friendly tribes as he could, but his numbers were inferior. He went to Carpetania (in central Hispania) seized the town of Aebura (Talavera de la Reina, in western part of the province of Toledo; it was at the edge of the territory of the Vettones). Quintus Fulvius then marched through Carpetania and went to Contrebia (Contrebia Belaisca near Botorrita, in the province of Zaragoza). The townsfolk sent for Celtiberian assistance by they were delayed by floods. The praetor seized the city and heavy rains forced him to take his army into the town. After the floods the Celtiberians arrived, saw no Roman camp and were caught by surprise then the Roman army came out of the town. They lost 12,000 men and 5,000 men and 400 horses were captured. Quintus Fulvius then marched through Celtiberian territory, ravaged the countryside and stormed many forts until the Celtiberians surrendered. In Hispania Ulterior the praetor Publius Manlius fought several successful actions against the Lusitanians.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.30‚Äì34 In 180 BC, the praetors Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Lucius Postumius Albinus were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. Messengers brought news of the Celtiberian surrender and requested that Quintus Fulvius Flaccus be allowed to bring back the army. Livy wrote that this was a must because the soldiers were determined to go back home and it seemed impossible to keep them in Hispania any longer. Mutiny was a possibility. Tiberius Gracchus objected to this because he did not want to lose the veterans and have an army of raw and undisciplined recruits. A compromise was reached. Gracchus was ordered to levy two legions (5,200 infantry each, but only a total of 400 cavalry instead of the usual 600) and an additional 1,000 infantry, 50 cavalry plus 7,000 Latin infantry and 300 cavalry (a total of 18,400 infantry and 750 cavalry). Flaccus was allowed to bring back home veterans who had been sent to Hispania before 186 BC, while those who arrived after that date were to remain. He could bring back in excess of 14,000 infantry and 600 cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.35.8‚Äì13; 40.36.7‚Äì10 Since his successor was late, Flaccus started a third campaign against the Celtiberians who had not surrendered, ravaging the more distant part of Celtiberia. This caused them to secretly gathered an army. They planned to strike at the Manlian Pass, which the Romans would have needed to pass through. However, he was ordered to bring his army to Tarraco (Tarragona), where Tiberius Gracchus was to disband the old army and incorporate the new troops. Gracchus was due to arrive soon. Flaccus had to abandon his campaign and withdraw from Celtiberia. The Celtiberians thought he was fleeing because he found out about their rebellion and continued to prepare their trap at the Manlian Pass. When the Romans entered the pass they were attacked on both sides. Quintus Fulvius won a hard-fought battle. The Celtiberians lost 17,000 men; 4,000 men and 600 horses were captured; 472 Romans, 1,019 Latin allies and 3,000 native auxiliaries died. Flaccus went to Tarraco the next day.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.39.1‚Äì8; 40.1‚Äì13 Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus had landed two days earlier. The two commanders selected the soldiers who were to be discharged and those who were to remain. Flaccus returned to Rome with his veterans and Gracchus went to Celtiberia.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.40.14‚Äì15 In 179 BC, Tiberius. Sempronius Gracchus and Lucius Postumius Albinus had their commands extended. They were reinforced with 3,000 Roman and 5,000 Latin infantry and 300 Romans and 400 Latin cavalry. They planned a joint operation. Lucius Postumius Albinus, whose province had been quiet, was to march against the Vaccaei via Lusitania and turn to Celtiberia if there was a greater war there. Tiberius Gracchus was to head into the furthest part of Celtiberia. He first took the city of MundaThis must be an unknown town‚Äîas the well-known town of Munda, near which Julius Caesar fought the last battle of his civil war, was in Baetica (Andalusia), in the south. in an unexpected night attack. He took hostages, left a garrison, and burned the countryside until he reached a powerful town the Celtiberian called Certima. When the Celtiberians decided not to come to its aid, the town surrendered. An indemnity was imposed on them and they had to give 40 young nobles to serve in the Roman army as a pledge of loyalty.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.44.4.5; 40.47 Tiberius Gracchus moved on to Alce,It was probably the Alces who the Antonine itinerary placed between Augusta Emerita (M√©rida) and Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza). where the Celtiberian camp was. He won the battle and the enemy lost 9,000 men and 320 men and 112 horses where captured; 109 Romans fell. Gracchus then marched further into Celtiberia, which he plundered. The tribes submitted. In a few days 103 towns surrendered. He then returned to Alce and begun to besiege the city. The city surrendered and many nobles were taken, including the two sons and the daughter of Thurru, a Celtiberian chief and, according to Livy, by far the most powerful man in Hispania. Thurru asked for safe conduct to visit Tiberius Gracchus. He asked him whether he and his family would be allowed to live. When Gracchus replied affirmatively he asked if he was allowed to serve with the Romans. He granted this, too. From then on Thurru followed and helped the Romans in many places.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.48, 49 Tiberius Gracchus founded the colony (settlement) of Gracchurris (Alfaro, in La Rioja, northern Hispania) in the Upper Ebro Valley. This marked the beginning of Roman influence in northern Hispania. It was thought that this was the only colony he founded. However, in the 1950s an inscription was found near Mangibar, on the banks of the River Baetis (Guadalquivir), which attests that he founded another one. It was Iliturgi, a mining town and a frontier outpost.Knapp, RC., Aspects of the Roman Experience in Iberia, 206‚Äì100 BC, p.110, n. 18 Therefore, Gracchus established a colony outside his province. He concluded treaties with the surrounding tribes. Appian wrote that his 'treaties were longed for in subsequent wars'.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 43 Unlike previous praetors he spent time to negotiate and cultivate personal relations with tribal leaders. This was reminiscent of the friendly relations established by Scipio Africanus during the Second Punic War.Livy, The History of Rome, 40.47.3‚Äì10; 40.49.4‚Äì7Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, pp. 58 Gracchus imposed the vicensima, the requisition 5% of the grain harvest, a form of tax that was more efficient and less vulnerable to abuse than the usual Roman practice of tendering tax collection to private 'tax farmers.' Silva notes this is the first reference to a regulatory collection of revenue.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, pp. 263 n. 75 His treaties stipulated that the allies were to provide the Romans with auxiliary troops. They also established that the natives could fortify existing cities, but not found new ones.Curchin, L., A., A Roman Spain, pp. 32‚Äì33 There is some evidence that he introduced civilian administrative measures, such the issuing of rights for mining to mint coins and the construction of roads.Richardson, J., R., Hispaniae, Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, pp. 112‚Äì123 Tiberius Gracchus was remembered for his treaties and his administrative arrangements, which helped maintain peace in Hispania for the next quarter of a century.Silva, L., Viriathus and the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, p. 58  Period of relative peace  For the 24 years from the end of the First Celtiberian War in 179 BC to the beginning of the Second Celtiberian War in 155 BC, we rely on the work of Livy only up to 167 BC, up to the end of Book 45. Livy's subsequent books are lost and we have a gap of twelve years hardly any information. The epitome, which provides a brief summary of all of Livy's books (the Periochae) does not mention any conflicts in Hispania in these 12 years. It appears that this was a 24-year period of relative peace in which battles took place in Hispania in only three years. The beginning of Livy's book 41 has been lost, and we do not know if there was any account of events in Hispania for 178 BC. For 177 BC, he only mentioned that one legion plus 5,000 infantry and 250 cavalry from the allies were given to Marcus Titinius, (who was recorded as having elected as praetor in 178 BC without specifying to which province he was assigned at the end of book 39). Livy then wrote that he was in Hispania without specifying which province.Livy, The History of Rome, 41.9.3 In 176 BC. Marcus Cornelius Scipio Maluginensis and Publius Licinius Crassus were assigned Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively. Both men found excuses not to go. Were are not told why these two praetors were unwilling to take their office; normally they were taken up eagerly. It is at this point that we find out who the other praetor was. Livy wrote that the praetorships of Marcus Titinius and Titus Fonteius in Hispania were extended. Again, Livy did not specify which of the two provinces each held. They were given reinforcements of 3,000 Roman and 5,000 Latin infantry and 200 Roman and 300 Latin cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 41.15.9‚Äì11 In 174 BC, Cnaeus Servilius Caepio and Publius Furius Philus were assigned Hispania Ulterior and Citerior respectively and were given 3,000 Roman and 5,000 Latin infantry and 150 Roman and 300 Latin cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 41.21.3 In a passage that comes after the recording of the praetors for 174 BC, Livy wrote about a praetor called Appius Claudius and noted that on his arrival in Hispania the Celtiberians, who had surrendered to Tiberius Gracchus were quiet during the praetorship of Marcus Titinius, rebelled. Presumably he was a praetor for 175 BC and the record of his election was in the part of chapter 18 of book 40, which is lost. He was probably the praetor of Hispania Citerior. The Celtiberians attacked the Roman camp by surprise at dawn. They engaged the Romans as they were coming out of the gates of the camp. After an initial struggle the Romans forced their way out and formed a line against the flanks of the Celtiberians, who surrounded them. They burst out so suddenly that the enemy could not withstand their charge and was repulsed. Their camp was captured; 15,000 were killed or captured. This ended the conflict. The Celtiberians submitted.Livy, The History of Rome, 41.26 We do not have any information on the other praetor in Hispania. He might have been referred to the mentioned missing text. Richardson holds that a man with the cognomen Cento (usually written as Centho in the literary sources) is recorded in the Fasti Triumphales and that he may have been the praetor of Hispania Ulterior who succeed Titus Fontueus. Therefore, he must have won a battle, but there is no record of his activities.Richardson, Hispaniae, Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218‚Äì82 BC, pp. 103. The Fasti Triumphales is a list of triumphs form the foundation of Rome to 12 BC. In 173 BC, the praetors Numerius Fabius Buteo and Marcus Matienus were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. They were reinforced by 3,000 Roman infantry and 200 cavalry. Numerius Fabius Buteo died in Massalia (Marseilles) while on his way. His replacement was chosen by lot between the two departing praetors and the assignment fell on Publius Furius Philus.Livy, The History of Rome, pp. 42.1.2, 5; 42.4.1‚Äì3 In 172 BC, Marcus Junius and Spurius Lucretius were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. The senate refused to give them reinforcements. They then made their request again and received 3,000 Roman and 5,000 allied infantry and 50 Roman and 300 allied cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.10.13; 42.18.6 During the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC) only one praetor was allocated to Hispania. In 171 BC, it was allocated to Lucius Canuleius Dives.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.28.5 = Trials for extortion = In 171 BC, envoys of several allied peoples from both the provinces in Hispania went to Rome. They complained about the rapacity and arrogance of Roman officials. They asked the senate not to allow them 'to be more wretchedly despoiled and harassed than its enemies'. There were many acts of injustice and of extortion. Lucius Canuleius Dives was tasked with assigning five judges of senatorial rank for each man the Hispanics were seeking to recover money from and to allow the latter to choose advocates. They were told to nominate them. They chose Marcus Porcius Cato (who had conducted the Roman campaign of 195 BC), Publius Cornelius Scipio (who had been praetor in Hispania Ulterior in 193 BC), Lucius Aemilius Paulus (who had been praetor in Hispania Ulterior from 191 to 189 BC) and Gaius Sulpicius Gallus. The case of Marcus Titinius (praetor in Hispania Citerior in 175 BC) was taken up first and was heard by a board of judges. This trial was adjourned twice and on the third session he was acquitted. There was a dispute between the envoys of the two provinces. As a result, the peoples of Hispania Citerior chose Marcus Porcius Cato and Publius Cornelius Scipio as advocates and the peoples of Hispania Ulterior chose Lucius Aemilius Paulus and Gaius Sulpicius Gallus. The case of the people of Citerior was against Publius Furius Philus (praetor 174 and 173 BC) and that of the people of Ulterior was against Marcus Matienus (praetor in 173 BC). Livy made a mistake and wrote that they were praetors for three and two years respectively. Both were accused of most serious offences and both cases were adjourned. Cato made a speech (Pro Hispanis de frumento) in which he attacked Publius Furius Philus for unjust valuation of grain received as tribute. At the new trial it was reported that both men had gone into exile outside Roman territory, the former to Praeneste, the latter to Tibur (two Latin towns, today's Palestrina and Tivoli). There were suspicions that their representatives would not allow charges against 'men of rank and influence'. These were heightened when Lucius Canuleius Dives abandoned the investigation and left for his province suddenly. The senate granted the request of the Hispanics that no Roman official was to be allowed to set the price of grain or force the locals to sell there 5% quota at the price he wished and that no officers could be placed over the towns to collect money.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.2 This was the earliest known trial of an official thus accused by provincials. Previous complaints of like nature had been adjudicated by the senate or the consuls.Cf. note 8 in the translation of Livy by Alfred C. Schlesinger, 43.2 The senate appointed the recuperatores (recuperators) to investigate extortion and maladministration by the praetors and to recover damages for provincial plaintiffs. The trials were a precursor of the standing court of recovery of property (quaestio de pecuniis repetundis) established by a Calpurnian Law of 149 BC, whose judges were transferred from the patrician aristocracy to the equestrians by Gaius Gracchus in 122 BC.Johnson, Coleman-Norton & Bourne, Ancient Roman Statutes, Austin, 1961, pp. 38Gruen E., S., Roman Politics and the Criminal Courts (1968), p. 10 Another deputation from Hispania represented 4,000 men who said that they were sons of Roman soldiers and local women who could not legally marry. They asked that a town be given to them to live in. The senate asked them to give their names and the names of anyone they had manumitted to Lucius Canuleius. It decreed they should be settled at Cartei, on the coast, and the Carteians who wished to remain were to be allowed to join the colonists and receive a plot land. The town became the \\"Colony of the Libertini\\" with Latin rights.Livy, The History of Rome, pp. 43.3.1‚Äì4 In 169 BC, Hispania was given reinforcements of 3,000 Roman and infantry and 300 cavalry and the number of soldiers in each legion was fixed at 5,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. The praetor Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was assigned Hispania, was to demand from the local allies 4,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. He seized the noted city of Marcolica (Marjaliza).Livy, The History of Rome, 43.11.7; 43.12.10‚Äì11; 43.15.7; 45.4.1 In 168 BC, Hispania was assigned to Publius Fonteius. In 167 BC, after the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC) it was decided to reconstitute two provinces in Hispania. The praetors Cneius Fulvius and Licinius Nerva were assigned Hispania Citerior and Ulterior respectively. In 166 BC, Licinius Nerva, Publius Rutilius Calvus were assigned 'the two Spanish provinces'; Livy did not specify which one each was assigned toLivy, The History of Rome, 45.16.1, 3; 45.44.1‚Äì2 Livy's book 45 ends with the year 167 BC. At this point, the rest of the books of Livy are lost. The mentioned epitome (the Periochae), which gave a very brief summary of all of Livy's books, records that there several unsuccessful campaigns in Hispania by various commanders in 154 BC and that in that year there was the beginning of the consuls being elected slightly earlier and starting their office on 1 January instead of 15 March as customary. This was caused by a rebellion in Hispania. This is a reference to the Second Celtiberian War.Livy, Periochae, from book 47  Second Celtiberian War  Appian wrote that this war broke out because Segeda (near Zaragoza), a powerful city of the Celtiberian tribe of the Belli, persuaded the people of some smaller towns to settle there and was building a circuit of walls seven kilometres long. It also forced the neighbouring Titti to join in. The Belli had agreed to the treaties Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus had made with tribes in Hispania at the end of the First Celtiberian War. Rome considered that Segeda was breaking the treaty. It forbade the building of the wall and demanded the tribute and the provision of a contingent for the Roman army in accordance with the stipulations of Gracchus' treaty. The Segedans replied that the treaty forbade the construction of new towns, but did not forbid the fortification existing ones. They also said that they had been subsequently released from the tribute and the military contingent by the Romans. This was true, but the senate argued that when it granted such exemptions it always specified that they were to continue only during its pleasure.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 44 The senate must have decided to withdraw the exemptions because it was worried about the development of Segeda into a powerful city in the land of the Celtiberians, who had a history of rebellions. Rome prepared for war. In 153 BC, the praetor Quintus Fabius Nobilitor arrived in Hispania with a force of nearly 30,000 men. The people of Segeda, whose wall had not been completed, fled and sought refuge among the Arevaci (another Celtiberian tribe), who welcomed them. An ambush in a thick forest with 20,000 infantry and 500 cavalry was prepared. The Romans lost 6,000 men. From then on they would not engage in battle on the day of the festival of the god Vulcan because this defeat occurred on that day.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 45 The Arevaci assembled at the town of Numantia (seven kilometres north of today's Soria, on a hill known as Cerro de la Muela near Garray), which had strong natural defences. Three days later Nobilitor encamped four kilometres from the town. He was joined by 300 cavalry and ten elephants sent by Masinissa, the king of Numidia, a Roman ally in Africa. The sight of the elephants frightened the enemy, who had never seen these animals. They fled inside the town. However, during the ensuing fierce battle an elephant was hit by a large falling stone and made a loud noise, which frightened the other elephants. They went on the rampage, trampling over the Romans, who took to disorderly flight. The Numantines made a sortie and killed 4,000 Romans and three elephants. Nobilitor then attacked the town of Axinium, which stored the enemy supplies, but did not achieve anything. He lost many men and returned to his camp at night. These Roman disasters encouraged the town of Ocilis (Medinaceli, also in the modern province of Soria) to defect to the Celtiberians. The Roman provisions were kept in this town. Nobilitor withdrew to his winter camp and suffered food shortages. Because of this, heavy snowstorms and frost many of his men died.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, 46‚Äì47 In 152 BC, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul for the third time, took over the command, bringing 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to Hispania. He avoided an ambush and he encamped in front of Ocilis. He seized the town and granted it pardon. This encouraged Nertobriga (a town of the Belli, in the modern province of Zaragoza) to ask for peace. Marcellus asked for 100 cavalry and they agreed. However, a raid on the rear guard of the Romans led to Marcellus besieging the town, which sent a herald to ask for peace again. Marcellus said that he would not grant peace unless the Arevaci, Belli, and Titti asked for it together. The Nertobriges sent ambassadors to these tribes and asked Marcellus for leniency and for the renewal of the treaty made with Tiberius Gracchus. This was opposed by some rural people who had been incited to war. Marcellus sent envoys from each party to Rome to carry on their dispute there and sent private letters to the senate letters urging peace. For details about these deputations in Rome see the main article. Marcellus wanted to bring the war to an end himself and gain glory this way.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 48‚Äì49 The senate rejected the peace and sent a new consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, to continue the war. Marcellus told the Celtiberians about the impending war and gave them back their hostages on their request. He held a conference with the Celtiberians. After this 5,000 Arevaci took Nergobriga. Marcellus went to Numantia and drove the Numantines inside the city walls. They asked for peace talks. The Belli, Titti and Arevaci put themselves in his hands. Marcellus asked for hostages and money. He succeeded in bringing the war to an end before the arrival of Lucullus.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 50 Appian wrote that Lucullus was greedy for fame and money. He attacked the Vaccaei (a tribe who lived to the east of the Arevaci) because he was 'in straitened circumstances'. This was despite the fact that the senate had not declared war on them and this tribe had never attacked the Romans. He pretended that they were supplying the Celtiberians as an excuse for war. He crossed the River Tagus and encamped near the town of Cauca (Coca in the province of Segovia). The consul said that they had mistreated the Carpetani and that he had come to their aid as an excuse for his presence there. The Caucaei lost a battle and sued for peace. Lucullus demanded hostages, 100 talents of silver and a contingent of cavalry for his army. When these were provided he also demanded that the town be garrisoned by the Romans. This was agreed and Lucullus ordered 2,000 picked soldiers to seize the city. Then the rest of the Roman army, which had been ordered to kill all adult males, was let in. Only a few out of 20,000 managed to escape. Some of them went to other towns. They burnt what they could not take with them to deprive Lucullus of booty.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 51‚Äì52 Lucullus marched on the town of Itercatia, where more than 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry had taken refuge. He called for peace talks. The inhabitants reproached him for the slaughter of the Caucaei and asked him if he intended to do the same to them. Appian wrote: \\"he, like all guilty souls, being angry with his accusers instead of reproaching himself, laid waste their fields\\". He then begun a siege and repeatedly lined up his men for battle to provoke a fight. The enemy did not respond. The soldiers were sick due to lack of sleep and dysentery caused by the local food they were not used to. Many died of the latter. When some of the siege works were completed the Romans knocked down a section of the city walls, but they were quickly overpowered. They fled and not knowing the area many fell into a reservoir and died. The enemy repaired the wall. As both sides suffered famine, Scipio Aemilianus, an officer, proposed peace and promised that it would not be violated. The Itercalati trusted him and gave Lucullus 10,000 cloaks, some cattle and 50 hostages as part of the terms.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 53‚Äì54 Next Lucullus went to Pallantia (Pelencia). This town was hosting a large number of refugees and was renowned for its bravery. He was advised to avoid it, but he heard that it was a rich town. He encamped there and did not leave until constant harassment of the Roman foragers by the Pallantian cavalry prevented him from getting supplies. The Romans withdrew and were pursued by the enemy until they reached the River Durius (Douro). Lucullus went to the territory of the Turdetani (in Hispania Ulterior) and went into winter camps. This was the end of his illegal war against the Vaccaei. He was never called to account for it.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 55 Appian commented: \\"As for the gold and silver that Lucullus was after (and for the sake of which he had waged this war, thinking that all of Hispania abounded with gold and silver), he got nothing. Not only did they have none, but these particular [tribes] did not set any value on those metals.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 54 In his account of the Lusitanian War, Appian wrote that Lucullus and Servius Sulpicius Galba, a praetor who was in charge of the troops in Hispania Ulterior and was campaigning against a Lusitanian rebellion, conducted a joint pincer operation against Lusitania. According to Appian they gradually depopulated it. Appian described Galba as being even more greedy than Lucullus. He killed many Lusitanians by treachery.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 59  Lusitanian War and Viriathic War  Lusitania was probably the area of the peninsula that resisted the Roman invasion for the longest time. Until the year 155 BC, the Lusitanian chief Punicus made raids into the part of Lusitania controlled by Rome, ending with the twenty-year peace made by the former praetor Sempronius Gracchus. Punicus obtained an important victory against the praetors Manilius and Calpurnius, inflicting 6,000 casualties. After the death of Punicus, Caesarus took charge of the fight against Rome, vanquishing the Roman troops again in 153 BC, revealing his banner in the battle, which triumphantly showed to the rest of the Iberian peoples how to display the vulnerability of Rome. At the time, the Vetones and Celtiberians had united in resistance, leaving the situation for Rome in this area of Hispania somewhat precarious. Lusitanians, Vetones and Celtiberians raided the Mediterranean coasts, while, to secure their position on the Peninsula, they deployed to North Africa. It was in this year that two new consuls arrived in Hispania, Quintus Fulvius Nobilior and Lucius Mummius. The urgency of restoring dominion over Hispania made the two consuls enter into battle within two and a half months. The Lusitanians sent to Africa were defeated at Okile (modern Arcila in Morocco) by Mummius, who forced them to accept a peace treaty. For his part, the consul Serbius Sulpicius Galba made a peace treaty with three of the Lusitanian tribes, and then, pretending to be a friend, killed the youth and sold the rest of the people to Gaul. Nobilior was replaced in the following year (152 BC) by Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC). He in turn was succeeded in 150 BC by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was distinguished by his cruelty and infamy. In 147 BC, a new Lusitanian leader named Viriathus rebelled against the Roman forces. He had fled from Serbius Sulpicius Galba three years earlier, and, reuniting the Lusitanian tribes again, Viriathus began a guerrilla war that fiercely struck the enemy without giving open battle. He commanded many campaigns and arrived with his troops at the Murcian coasts. His numerous victories and the humiliation he inflicted upon the Romans made him worthy of the permanent place he holds in Portuguese and Spanish memory as a revered hero who fought without respite. Viriathus was assassinated about 139 BC by Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, probably paid off by the Roman General Marcus Popillius Lenas. With his death, the organized Lusitanian resistance did not disappear but Rome continued to expand into the region. The destruction led by Decimus Junius Brutus is an archaeological evidence in Cividade de Terroso. Roman reconstruction, quadrangular buildings instead of native circular ones, is also visible. Between 135 and 132 BC, Consul Decimus Junius Brutus brought about an expedition to Gallaecia (north of Portugal and Galicia). Almost simultaneously (133 BC) the Celtiberian city Numantia, the last bastion of the Celtiberians, was destroyed. This was the culminating point of the war between the Celtiberians and the Romans between 143 BC and 133 BC; the Celtiberian city had been taken by Publius Cornelius Scipio √Ümilianus, when the opportunity was too much to resist. The Celtiberian chiefs committed suicide with their families and the rest of the population was sold into slavery. The city was razed.  The Numantine War  In 143 BC, the consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus subdued the Arevaci by attacking them suddenly while they were harvesting. He did not take Termantia and Numantia. In 142 BC, the praetor Quintus Pompeius Aulus took over with a well- trained army of 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. While he went away, the Numantines made a sortie against a cavalry detachment and destroyed it. On his return, the Numantines offered battle, but they withdrew slowly until he was drawn to the ditches and palisades. When his forces were repeatedly defeated in skirmishes Quintus Pompeius moved on to attack Termantia, but lost 700 men. In a third battle, the Romans were driven to a rocky place where many of them were forced down a precipice. An indecisive battle followed. Pompeius then went to the town of Malia, which was surrendered by treachery. He fought some brigands at Sedatania and defeated them.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 76 Pompeius went back to Numantia and tried to divert a river to reduce the town by famine. The men who were doing this work were constantly harassed and those who came to their rescue were attacked and forced into the Roman camp. The foragers were also attacked. A Roman envoy arrived with an army or raw and undisciplined recruits who were to replace the soldiers who had served their six years. Pompeius stayed in winter camps with these recruits, who were exposed to the cold without shelter and caught dysentery because they were not used to the local water. Many died. A foraging party was ambushed. Pompeius sent his soldiers to the towns to spend the rest of the winter and waited for his successor. Fearing that he would be held to account for his failures he approached the Numantines. The concluded a peace agreement. Pompeius demanded hostages, the prisoners, the deserters, and 30 talents of silver, part of which was to be paid in instalments.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 77‚Äì79 In 139 BC, when the new consul,Marcus Popillius Laenas, arrived to take over, the last instalment was being paid. Pompeius, knowing that he had made a peace the Romans considered disgraceful and without the consent of the senate, denied that he had made a deal. The Numantines proved the contrary through the testimony of the senatorial envoys and his officers. Pompeius and Numantine envoys were sent to Rome to continue the dispute there. The senate decided to continue the war. Popillius Laenas attacked the Lusones, a Celtiberian tribe close to Numantia, but did not accomplish anything and returned to Rome. In 137 BC, the consul Gaius Hostilius Mancinus lost frequent clashes with the Numantines. On false rumours that the Cantabri of northern Hispania and the Vaccaei of west-central Hispania were coming to the aid of the Numantines he panicked, left the camp and went to an empty place where a commander in the Second Celtiberian War had a camp. At dawn he was surrounded and he was without fortifications. The Numantines threatened to kill everyone if he did not make peace. He agreed terms like those made by Quintus Pompeius Aulus. This caused outrage in Rome. Another consul, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Porcina, was sent to Hispania and Mancinus was recalled to stand trial.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 79‚Äì80 Plutarch said that he was \\"not bad as a man, but most unfortunate of the Romans as a general.\\"Plutarch, Life of Tiberius Gracchus, p. 5.1 Aemilius Lepidus, who wanted glory, did not wait for instructions from Rome and attacked the Vaccaei, who lived in west-central Hispania to the west of the Celtiberians, falsely accusing them of supplying the Numantines. He ravaged the countryside and started a siege of their main town, Pallantia. He persuaded Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus, his brother-in-law who had carried out counterinsurgency operations in Lusitania and Gallaecia, to join him. Messengers from Rome arrived. They said that the senate was at a loss to know what he should seek a new war and warned him not to proceed. Aemilius carried on regardless. The siege of Pallantia dragged on and the Roman supplies failed. All pack animals and many men died. The Romans withdrew in a disorderly way at night. At dawn the enemy attacked them at the rear and flank all day. Aemilius Lepidus was stripped of this consulship and when he returned to Rome he was fined. In 135 BC, the consul Quintus Calpurnius Piso was assigned Hispania.He made an incursion in the territory of Pallantia, collected a small amount of plunder and spent the rest of his term of office in winter camp in Carpetania (in central Hispania).Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 80‚Äì83 In 134 BC, the Romans, who were tired of this war, elected Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (who had defeated Carthage) as consul because they thought that he was the only man who could win the war. The army in Hispania was demoralised and ill-disciplined. Scipio concentrated on restoring discipline by forbidding luxuries the troops had become accustomed to, through regular tough exercises (all-day marches, building camps and fortifications and then demolishing them, digging ditches and then filling them up, and the like) and by enforcing regulations strictly. When he thought that the army was ready he encamped near Numantia. He did not proceed along the shorter route to avoid the guerrilla tactics the Numantines were good at. Instead, he made a detour through the land of the Vaccaei, who now were selling food to the Numantines. He was ambushed several times, but defeated the enemy. In one of these ambushes, by a river that was difficult to cross, he was forced to make a detour along a longer route where there was no water. He marched at night when it was cooler and dug wells into bitter water. He saved his men, but some horses and pack animals died of thirst. Then he passed through the territory of the Caucaei who had broken the treaty with Rome and declared that they could return safely to their homes. He returned to the Numanitine territory and was joined by Jugurtha, the grandson of the king of Numidia (a Roman ally in Africa), with twelve elephants, archers and slingers.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 84‚Äì89 Eventually, Scipio prepared to besiege Numantia. He asked the allied tribes in Hispania for specified numbers of troops. He built a nine kilometres circuit of fortifications with seven towers. The wall was three metres high and two and a half metres wide. He built an embankment of the same dimensions as the wall around the adjoining marsh, and two towers by the River Durius (Douro) to which he moored large timbers with ropes full of knives and spear heads, constantly kept in motion by the current. This prevented the enemy from slipping through covertly. He managed to force Numantia into starvation. The Numantines surrendered. Some killed themselves. Scipio kept 50 men for his triumph, sold the rest into slavery and destroyed the city.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 90‚Äì98 Appian wrote: \\"With only 8,000 men when the war began, how many and what terrible reverses they bring upon the Romans! How many treaties did they make on equal terms with the Romans, which the latter would not consent to make with any other people! How often did they challenge to open battle the last commander sent against them, who had an army of 60,000 men!\\" He noted \\"their small numbers and great sufferings, their valiant deeds and long endurance.\\"Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 97  Aftermath of the defeat of the Lusitanians and the Celtiberians  The defeats of the Celtiberians and the Lusitanians were a major step in the pacification of Hispania. It did not end the rebellions, but these were sporadic and, apart from a period after the Cimbrian War (113‚Äì101 BC), they were on a reduced scale. Plutarch noted that Gaius Marius conducted operations in Hispania Ulterior in 114 BC: \\"the province of [Hispania Ulterior] was allotted to him, and here he is said to have cleared away the robbers, although the province was still uncivilized in its customs and in a savage state, and robbery was at that time still considered a most honourable occupation.\\"Plutarch, Parallel Lives: The Life of Gaius Marius, p. 6.1 Appian wrote that Calpurnius Piso was sent as a commander to Hispania because there were revolts. The following year, Servius Galba was sent without soldiers because the Romans were busy with Cimbrian War and a slave rebellion in Sicily (the [Third Servile War], 104‚Äì100 BC). In the former war the Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutones migrated around Europe and invaded territories of allies of Rome, particularly in southern France, and routed the Romans in several battles until their final defeat. In 105 BC, some of them also made a foray in northern Hispania and then returned to Gaul. Appian wrote that the Romans sent governors who would settle affairs in Hispania without war as much as they could. This decrease in the military presence and possibly the mentioned foray into northern Hispania might have encouraged significant rebellions. In 98 BC, after the defeat of the Cimbri, the consul Titus Didius was sent to Hispania. He killed about 20,000 Arevaci. He also moved Tarmesum, \\"a large city always insubordinate to the Romans\\", from hills that were easily defended to the plain, and forbade the construction of city walls. He besieged the city of Colenda for nine months, seized it, and sold the inhabitants, including women and children. A city near Colenda lived by robbery because of its poverty. It was inhabited by mixed Celtiberian tribes who had been allies of Marcus Marius in a war against the Lusitianians and he settled them there five years earlier with the approval of the senate. Titus Didius wanted to destroy them and got the approval of senatorial commissioners. He told the city that he would allot the land of Colenda to them and to assemble for the parcelling out of the land. He moved the Roman soldiers out of their camp and told the people to go in there because he wanted to put the men on a register and the women and children on another. When they got in, he had them killed by the army. This is similar to the kind of treachery with which Servius Sulpicius Galba butchered many Lusitanians to end their rebellion of 155‚Äì150 BC (see Lusitanian War and Viriathic War section).Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 99‚Äì100 In 82 BC, there was a Celtiberian rebellion. Gaius Valerius Flaccus was sent against them and killed 20,000. The people of the town of Belgida burned the leaders in the senate house when they hesitated to revolt. When Flaccus heard of this, he executed the ringleaders for this deed.Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, p. 100 Titus Didius was the first consul sent to Hispania since the end on the Numantine War. He did not return to Rome until his triumph in 93 BC. He was probably the governor of Hispania Citerior and Publius Licinius Crassus, who celebrated a triumph over the Lusitanians in 93 BC, was probably the governor of Hispania Ulterior. Valerius Flaccus returned to Rome for his triumph in 81 BC, which was awarded for his actions in both Celtiberia and Gallia Narbonensis. It is not possible to determine whether his terms as governor in Hispania and Gaul were overlapping or sequential. No other governor is documented for Hispania in this period, and since the senate only began assigning Gallia Narbonensis as a regular province in the mid-90s, administrative arrangements were still evolving. Cicero, refrained from calling him the lawful governor there.E. Badian, \\"Notes on Provincial Governors,\\" pp. 95 Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War (1.47.4) attested that he was in Gaul in 83 BC. The Tabula Contrebiensis, a bronze tablet, on which his ruling pertaining to boundaries and water-rights arbitration is inscribed, shows that he was in Hispania until at least 87 BC. The reason for these prolonged tenures of office in Hispania is unknown. Richardson speculates that they were probably connected with the situation of war in Italy, where there was the rebellion of the Italian allies against Rome (the Social War of 91‚Äì88 BC.Richardson, J. S, The Romans in Hispania, pp. 85‚Äì86 However, the dates do not quite coincide. According to Appian, in 61 BC, Julius Caesar, who was praetor in Hispania Citerior, brought under subjection \\"all those [Hispanics] who were doubtful of their allegiance, or had not yet submitted to the Romans\\".Appian, Roman History: The Foreign Wars, Book 6: The Wars in Spain, pp. 102 Suetonius specified that Caesar acted against the Lusitanians: \\"he not only begged money from the allies, to help pay his debts, but also attacked and sacked some towns of the Lusitanians although they did not refuse his terms and opened their gates to him on his arrival.\\"Suetonius, The Lives of the Caesars, The Life of Julius Caesar, p. 54.1  Conflict between Vascones and Celtiberians  For more than a century, the Vascones (who are considered to be the ancestors of the Basques) and the Celtiberians fought over the rich land of the River Ebro Valley. The Celtiberian town of Calagurris (Calahorra) probably carried the brunt of the conflict, helped by tribal alliances. The Vascones probably had a fairly important settlement on the other side of the Ebro, in an area across from Calagurris, which also gained the support of Vascones from other areas. The Celtiberians destroyed the city of the Vascones and occupied lands on the other side of the Ebro. Since the so-called \\"Celtiberians\\" were enemies of Rome, the Basques were Rome's allies. When Calagurris was destroyed by the Romans it was repopulated with Basques. It was probably the first Basque city on the other side of this river.  The Roman civil wars  = The Sertorian War = This civil war was fought in Hispania between Quintus Sertorius in coalition with native tribes and the regime of Sulla from 80 BC to 72 BC. It followed the two civil wars between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius in Italy (88‚Äì87 BC and 82 BC; see Sulla's civil wars). Sertorius had fought against Sulla in the first civil war. In 82 BC, he withdrew to Hispania as a governor representing his political faction, the populares. The Roman officials in Hispania did not recognise his authority, but he took control with his army. Sertorius sent an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees against Sulla's forces. However, Salinator was killed by treachery and these forces, under the command of Gaius Annius, broke through. Sertorius fled to Africa where he undertook a campaign in Mauretania in which he defeated one of Sulla's commanders and captured Tingis (Tangier). Disaffected Lusitanians sent envoys to Sertorius and chose him as their leader because of his benign policy when he was governor. The Lusitanians probably wanted someone who was sympathetic to them. In 80 BC, Sertorius defeated a naval force under Aurelius Cotta and landed in Hispania. He went to Lusitania, organised their tribes, returned Hispania Ulterior and won the Battle of the Baetis River. Rome sent Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, whom they appointed as governor of Hispania Ulterior, to counter this threat. He encamped at Metellinum (Medellin) and made several incursions against the Celtiberians and the Vaccaei of central Hispania who had allied with Sertorius. Two years of guerrilla tactics by Sertorius wore him down. Lucius Hirtuleius, Setrorius' lieutenant, defeated Marcus Domitius Calvinus, the governor of Hispania Citerior. Marcus Perpenna Vento, who had fought against Sulla, fled to Hispania with an army and wanted to fight Quintus Caecilius Metellus on his own. His soldiers were dissatisfied with his command and when they heard that Pompey was coming to Hispania with enemy forces they demanded to be taken to Sertorius. Marcus Perpenna yielded reluctantly. Pompey was pushed back by Sertorius, but Caecilius Metellus defeated Lucius Hirtuleius near Italica. In 75 BC, Caecilius Metellus defeated and killed Lucius Hirtuleius. Sertorius fought Pompey in an indecisive battle. Then Sertorius was defeated by Pompey and Caecilius Metellus. In 74 BC, Caecilius Metellus and Pompey concentrated their operations against the Celtiberians and Vaccaei. During 73 BC, there were tensions between the Sertorians and their native allies. Then Marcus Perperna assassinated Sertorius. Finally, Marcus Perperna was ambushed and captured by Pompey. = Julius Caesar's Civil War = In 49 BC, Julius Caesar invaded Italy, effectively declaring war on the Roman senate. Pompey, the leader of the forces of the senate, fled to Greece. Caesar executed an extraordinary 27-day forced march from Rome to Hispania to confront the legions of Pompey stationed there. He defeated seven Pompeian legions led by Lucius Afranius, Marcus Petreius and Marcus Terentius Varro at the Battle of Ilerda (Lerida), in north-eastern Hispania. There were further battles: one in southern Illyria (Albania) and one in Greece in 49 BC; and three in Africa (Tunisia, one in 49 BC and two in 46 BC). The final battle was between Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius, the son of Pompey, supported by Titus Labienus and Publius Attius Varus, in 45 BC. It was the Battle of Munda, which was fought at Campus Mundensis, probably near Lantejuela, in southern Hispania. One year later, Caesar was assassinated.  Last stage of the conquest: the Cantabrian Wars  The Cantabrian Wars (29‚Äì19 BC) were fought between the Romans and the Cantabrians and Astures of northern Hispania. It was a long and bloody war because it was fought on the mountains of Cantabria and Asturia (mountains are difficult to conquer) and because the rebels used guerrilla tactics effectively. The war dragged on for ten years and it ended with the subjugation of these two peoples. When these wars ended Augustus annexed the whole of Hispania to the Roman Empire and reorganised its provinces. These wars were also the end of resistance against the Romans in Hispania. The causes of this war are unclear. We hardly have any information about their first years, before the involvement of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The only extant writing on this war, apart from some references in passing by other authors, are a brief account by Florus and another equally brief one by Orosius. Both authors concentrated on when Augustus was engaged in the war. Florus wrote that the Cantabri tried to domineer their neighbours and harassed them, carrying out frequent raids on the Autrigones (who lived between the Atlantic and the source of the River Ebro) to their east, the Curgoni (or Turmodigi, in the area within the Arlanz√≥n and Arlanza river valleys in the modern province of Burgos) to their southeast, and the Vaccaei (in the northwest of central Hispania) to their south.Florus, Epitome of Roman History, p. 2.33 Orosius wrote much the same.Orosius, A History: Against the Pagans, p. 6.21 We do not know whether, or if so, how much of a part this played in the outbreak of the war. Augustus took the command in 26 BC, the fourth year of the war. He left Rome in 27 BC. There were rumours that he was going to conquer Britannia to perform a great military feat. Instead, he undertook the reorganisation of Gallic provinces that had been left largely unsupervised since their conquest by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars (58‚Äì50 BC). He might have seen the war in next door Hispania as a chance for military glory. He reached Tarraco (Tarragona) in eastern Hispania in 27 BC, but he arrived in the area too late for fighting before winter set in.Magie, D., \\"Augustus' War in Spain (26‚Äì25 BC).\\" Classical Philology, XV (1920), pp. 327 In terms of personal propaganda these wars became his war, even though he fought only one campaign. In 25 BC, he retired to Tarraco due to illness. Cassius Dio wrote that he fell ill from over- exertion and anxiety.Cassius Dio, Roman History, p. 53.25.7 Gonz√°lez Echegaray, places the involvement of Augustus in the political context of his task of delineating and defending the frontiers of the Roman Empire after the Roman civil wars. After the conquest of Gaul there was no more room for expansion and there was the task defence from attacks of the borders in Europe in the face of a reduction in size of the Roman army. In an economic context there was the question of control over the rich gold mine at Las Medullas (the richest in the empire) in Asturia and the abundant iron ores of Cantabria. Towards the end of the Roman Civil Wars there was a shortage of gold and silver.Gonz√°lez Echegaray, Joaqu√≠n. Las guerras c√°ntabras en las fuentes, pp. 153‚Äì55 In 29 BCE, the Roman commander was Titus Statilius Taurus. In 28 and 27 BCE it was Sextus Appuleius, who celebrated a triumph in 26 BCE. Augustus started his campaign in 26 BCE after having established his quarters in Segisama (today's Sasamon, in the province of Burgos), the capital of the Turmodigi who must obviously have been Roman allies. Three divisions attacked three points. The first one fought a battle under the city walls of Vellica and the enemy fled to Mount Vindius. This opened the way north, enabling the division to join the forces who had landed on the coast, and attack the enemy at the rear. Due to the ragged terrain the Romans decided to starve the enemy into surrender. The second division moved east and destroyed Aracelium. The third division moved west into Gallaecia. The enemy made a final stand at Mount Medullus in the Sierra de Mamed, close to the River Sil. It was besieged with a ditch 15 miles long. It capitulated in the winter; many committed suicide. Augustus came from Tarraco (where he had gone to due to his illness) to receive the surrender in person. In 25 BCE the war was fought only against the Astures. The Romans were led by Publius Carusius. Despite the reverses of the previous year, the Astures went on the offensive. They came down the snow- covered mountains and encamped on the River Astura (or, more likely the Orbigo, one of its tributaries) in the plain of Le√≥n. They split their forces into three columns to attach the three Roman camps. However, they were betrayed by one of their tribes, the Astures Brigaecini, who informed Carusius. He attacked them by surprise and pushed them to Lancia (near Villasabariego, Le√≥n). He besieged the town, which resisted fiercely, and seized it. The capture of other strongholds completed the conquest of the district. In Rome the door of the Temple of Janus was closed. This symbolised peace and the war was considered over. However, the Cantabri and the Astures soon resumed hostilities and the war continued for another six years. Still, Augustus was able to claim the glory of victory.Magie, D. \\"Augustus' War in Spain (26‚Äì25 BCE).\\" Classical Philology, XV (1920), p. 327 The defeat of the Cantabri and the Astures marked the end of the resistance against the Romans in Hispania. Despite the wars lasting ten years and the fierce resistance by these two peoples, it seems that there were no other rebellions in Hispania, not even by the neighbouring peoples, even though the written record is very thin. It is likely that the rest of the peninsula after the previous pacifications had become quite integrated into the Roman administrative system and economy. Augustus annexed the whole of the peninsula to the Roman Empire. The Roman province of Hispania Citerior was significantly expanded and came to include the eastern part of central Hispania and northern Hispania. It was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis. Hispania Ulterior was divided into the provinces of Baetica (most of modern Andalusia) and Lusitania, which covered present day Portugal up to the River Durius (Douro), the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca in today's Spain. After the wars there was an increase in the Roman presence in Hispania. The Romans deployed eight legions for the wars. Many of the veterans, who had the right to be granted a plot of land to farm on discharge, were settled in Hispania. Several Roman towns were founded: Augusta Emerita (Merida, Extremadura) in 25 BCE (it became the capital of the province of Hispania Lusitania; it was probably founded by Publius Carusius); Asturica Augusta (Astorga, province of Leon) in 14 BCE (it became an important administrative centre); Colonia Caesar Augusta or Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza, Arag√≥n) in 14 BCE; and Lucus Augusti (Lugo, Galicia) in 13 BCE (it was the most important Roman town in Gallaecia). The Roman presence had probably increased during the first century BCE as a number of Roman colonies were founded in this period: Colonia Clunia Sulpicia (in the province of Burgos, it was one of the most important Roman cities of the northern half of Hispania), C√°parra (in the north of Extremadura), Complutum (Alcal√° de Henares near Madrid). Augustus also commissioned the via Augusta (which went from the Pyrenees all the way to Cadiz, it was 1,500 kilometres or 900 miles long).

It was centered on champion drag racer John Force and his daughters, also drag racers.  Synopsis  John Force is one of the most dominant drivers in drag racing, having compiled 119 career victories and 13 NHRA championships by the start of the show's first season (he has since increased these totals to 138 and 16, respectively, as of the 2013 NHRA season). The show is reality-based, following John in his day- to-day life of juggling his business and his personal life. His wife, Laurie Force, managed contracts for his racing team, most notably landing the Wendy's restaurant sponsorship. When their children were born, she decided to be a stay at home mom, to give their daughters a more traditional upbringing. John and Laurie's daughters are (ages during season 1): *24-year-old Ashley ForceOfficial site - Ashley Force bio *22-year-old Brittany ForceOfficial site - Brittany Force bio *17-year-old Courtney ForceOfficial site - Courtney Force bio John's oldest daughter, Adria Force Hight (wife of John Force Racing driver Robert Hight), was born from a previous marriage, and while not featured on the series, has managed the finances for John Force Racing since she was 20 years old. However, now the three younger daughters have decided to follow in their father's footsteps, competing as drivers for his company. Ashley, named Rookie of the Year in Top Alcohol Dragster, is now president of John Force Entertainment.Official site - about the show Brittany (top fuel) and Courtney (funny car) also raced professionally. The show centers mostly around John Force now reconnecting with his daughters, having missed much of their younger childhoods due to his career. Now that his company has become one of the leading companies in the racing series, he wants to spend more quality time with his family. In doing so, he often becomes frustrated with his daughters' spending sprees, believing that they do not understand the value of money. In one episode, he takes them to the trailer where he was raised in relative poverty, pointing out his happiness there due to his loving and hard-working parents. Ashley is fiercely competitive, and a talented driver. Brittany is the most rebellious of the three. She and her father clash often, but ultimately it becomes obvious that he respects her spirited nature. Courtney races because she enjoys it, but doesn't let it control her life at the cost of her school activities. All of his daughters insist that an education should come before racing, a notion reinforced by Laurie. Although the series has the backdrop of the racing circuit, and his full support of his daughters career choices, it takes on a comical side when showing him trying to reconnect with being a father, and his often comical reactions to being the father of four very spirited and strong-willed girls. The show debuted on July 17, 2006, and gained steady momentum. The show begins with a montage, with a voice-over by Force stating: \\"You know, I've been racing for 30 years . . . I've won 13 (later 14) championships . . . I've been on fire from here to Australia . . . but NOTHING . . . could prepare me . . . for having daughters.\\" After Force won his 14th Funny Car Championship, the opening changed accordingly. The series was renewed for a second season, but A&E; confirmed that the show would not return for a third. The season 1 DVD is available on the John Force Racing website. The show's theme song is \\"Woman\\" by Australian band Wolfmother. Criticism over Season 2 premiere Season 2 premiered March 27, 2007 to criticism from some fans due to a racing accident just prior to its airing. On March 19, 2007, John Force Racing driver Eric Medlen crashed heavily and suffered severe head injuries during testing a day after the Gatornationals at Gainesville Raceway in Florida. Medlen died on March 23 after being taken off life support. It was later learned a tire failure and side-to-side oscillation in the crash which caused the fatal head injuries, a problem which Force and driver safety group president Kenny Bernstein have been working to fix. The entire motorsports community was in mourning and Medlen's memorial service was being held March 27, with an official funeral being held the next day. Some fans criticized the decision to continue with the season premiere on its scheduled day, instead of delaying the premiere of the second season temporarily and replacing the episode with a Season One episode featuring Medlen as a tribute.A&E; message boards Season 2 was dedicated to Medlen. The series ended with its 24th episode, \\"The Real Deal\\", on May 15, 2007.  Revival  At a press conference on September 12, 2013 in Charlotte, North Carolina, John Force announced the hiring of JMI, Octagon, and Rogers & Cowan Marketing and Entertainment Companies to help rebrand John Force Racing after losing Castrol and Ford as sponsors after the 2014 NHRA Season. Part of the rebranding effort will include a revival of Driving Force, though under a different name, and focusing more on Courtney and Brittany than the previous iteration of the show.

Description Striking characteristics of Pisaura mirabilis are its long legs (the fourth one being the longest) and its slender abdomen (opisthosoma). The male is between 10 and 13 mm, while the female is 12 to 15 mm. After final ecdysis, the male spiders weigh on average 54 mg and females 68 mg. The prosoma (cephalothorax) is variable in color, ranging from light to reddish brown and from gray to black. A lighter stripe is visible down the middle of the prosoma. The opisthosoma (abdomen) is long and narrow and tapered towards the rear end. The female spiders has a dark patch (epigyne) on the underside of her abdomen that includes the copulatory organs. Male genital openings can be found at the same location, but remain inconspicuous. Patterning and coloration varies due to polymorphism.Carl Wilhelm Hahn (Hrsg.: Peter Sacher), Monographie der Spinnen (1820‚Äì1836) ‚Äì Mit einem Kommentar in deutsch und englisch herausgegeben von Peter Sacher, Reprint der Orig.-Ausg.

S. 545‚Äì606, 591‚Äì593 Male spiders are stronger in contrast than females and look black, especially in comparison to the white nuptial gifts. Females tend to get paler towards the end of summer. The stripe along the back of the body can be found in all spiders and can be seen as crypsis, a protective measure against predators. Pisaura mirabilisThe pedipalps in nymphs and females look similar to legs. In males, this structure gets thicker towards the end and is used to store sperm until reproduction (bulbus). The outer chelicerae segment consists of three teeth. They catch their prey during the day and at night and are also active on warm winter days.  Habitat and distribution  Pisaura mirabilis has a palearctic distribution, and can be found all over Europe. These spiders inhabit the Canary Islands and Madeira, the Asian part of Russia, China and North Africa.P. Blandin: Etudes sur les Pisauridae africaines. I-XI. Rev. Suisse Zool. 81, Rev. Zool. afr. 89‚Äì93, 1974‚Äì1979P. Blandin: Cycle biologique et production de l'araign√©e Afropisaura valida (Simon 1885)(Araneae, Pisauridae) dans une savane d'Afrique occidentale (Lamto, C√¥te-d'Ivoire). Trop. Ecol. 20: 78‚Äì93, 1974 P. mirabilis lives in all habitats, but prefers wet environments, such as wet meadows, lowland moors, salt marshes, dunes, the edge of forests, and wet hedges. It inhabits all strata, from the ground to the top of trees, but are not found under rocks or in caves. These spiders can be found at altitudes up to 1500 m.  Lifecycle  The spider develops from a fertilised egg inside a cocoon into an embryo. After inversion, the embryo enters the prelarval stage. A few hours later, the prelarva moults into a larva. At this stage, the spiders are colorless but mobile, and can detect sensory signals from its surrounding. They do not have any eyes yet and their chelicerae are short and sharp. A few fine hairs can be found on their feet. Depending on the temperature, the larvae moult after 4.5 ‚Äì 7.5 days into the first nymphal stage. Once leaving the cocoon through an opening, they live in a protective web made by the mother, where they feed on the leftover yolk from their eggs and drink from water droplets. After about a week, the nymphs start suspending themselves from their own spider silk and start preying on fruit flies. This usually happens in the sixth or seventh nymphal stage. Cannibalism does not occur in the first few days, but occurs in later stages. The whole nymphal stage is divided into 12 stages at most. Male spiders become sexually mature in the 9th to 11th stages, females in the 10th to 12th stages. Temperature can influence the development and number of stages, with colder temperatures slowing down the process. Under good conditions, spiders can complete their nymphal development in fewer than 12 stages. The duration from prelarval stage to final moult (maturity) typically lasts 257 days for males (stage 10) and 289 days for females (stage 11). Adulthood is the period after final moult till death. Females live longer than males, the record being 247 days for females and 186.5 days for males. Depending on habitat, nursery web spiders hibernate once or twice during the nymphal stage. The period of hibernation (diapause) is spent in ground vegetation under leaves, moss, and stones. They can be found in garages and houses, as well. Some individuals in the south of France have been found under loose bark of the plane tree. The nymphs in stages 6 to 8 start hibernating in November and continue with their development towards the end of February to the beginning of March. Pisaura mirabilis in Western- and Central Europe reach sexual maturity in May, when sperm uptake, the search for females, offering of nuptial gifts, and courtship and mating takes place. In Northern and Eastern Europe, spiders reach sexual maturity only in June, while in Southern Europe, they become sexually mature in April. Nursery web spiders have a one-year annual cycle in southern Europe. They grow in summer, hibernate in winter, reach adulthood in spring, and reproduce and then die in autumn. Their offspring are sexually mature in the following spring. Spiders from the north have a two-year cycle, having to go through two hibernations before reaching sexual maturity. Spiders in Western and Central Europe have a mix of both one- and two-year cycles. Males have a two-month period to reproduce; females three and a half. Mating system Males of this species offer a nuptial gift to potential female mates. Some Pisaura mirabilis specimens have also been observed to use thanatosis during courtship.Hansen, S. H., Gonzalez S. F., Toft, S., & Bilde, T. (2008). Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift-giving spider Pisaura mirabilis. Behavioral Ecology 19: 546‚Äì551. After presenting the nuptial gift to the female, she bites on to the gift and the male moves to her epigyne to deposit sperm with his pedipalps. Throughout copulation, the male keeps a leg on the gift so as to be ready if she tries to escape with it or attack him. At this time, the male may feign death ‚Äì his limbs become straight and he is dragged along with the female while holding on to the gift. When the female stops, the male slowly \\"resurrects\\" and continues attempting to mate. Thanatosis in P. mirabilis has been observed to significantly increase the male's odds of successfully copulating from less than 30% to 89%.  Predators, parasites, and pathogens  Predators of Pisaura mirabilis includes spider wasps, tree frogs, lizards, and song birds during the day, and toads, shrew mice, and bats at night. Other spider species, as well as from the same species (cannibalism), consider P. mirabilis as prey. Nursery web spiders are often parasitised by nematodes, sphecoid wasps, and chalcid wasps, as well as other parasitic wasps and Acari. These parasites infect the spider and its eggs and cocoons, which can lead to destruction of a whole clutch of eggs. Baculoviridae and Rickettsia species infect nursery web spiders, as well. They most likely enter the gastrointestinal tract via the spiders' prey. Not only can nymphs and adults be infected, but different stages in the cocoon are infected, as well.

Family: Sparassidae (Giant Crab Spiders) (list) Description In the females of Micrommata virescens the body length can reach , while in the males it is about .Araneae The cephalothorax and the long legs of the females are bright green, with a lighter green abdomen showing a darker green median stripe. The eight eyes are arranged in two rows and surrounded by white hairs. Males are dark green-olive and have a narrower abdomen, with red sides and a red to red- brown median stripe bordered yellow. A bug blog Young spiders have a yellow- brown cephalothorax, with dark marginal and median stripes. Only after the last molting in the following spring the juveniles assume the typical coloration of the adults. The green coloration is due to the bilin micromatabilin and its conjugates in haemolymph, interstitial tissues and the yolk of oocytes. Habitat These characteristic huntsman spiders can be found at the edges of forests, in dry meadows, in damp woodland clearings and rides, where they prefer grass and the lower branches of trees. Biology These spiders are mainly diurnal. They do not build a web, and hunt insects in green vegetation, where they rely on their camouflage. Their green color makes them very difficult to be detected by predators. They grow relatively slowly, taking 18 months to reach maturity.Natur-lexikon Females are fertile from May through to September. A few days after mating, the males die. In July the females enclose the egg-sac into a few leaves stitched together. Cocoons are guarded by females. After about 4 weeks eggs hatch about 40-50 young spiders. References Further reading A.

He lived most of his life in Kansas City, Missouri and founded Longview, Washington and Longville, Louisiana. By 1906, Long owned of pine in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana and converted it into 61 lumberyards. As the timber land was deforested in Louisiana, he moved west to the state of Washington and bought of Douglas fir. There he became a pioneer in reforestation. Long eventually owned many acres of land and buildings, spanning the United States from Washington D.C. to the state of Washington. Early years Long was born December 17, 1850, in Shelbyville, Kentucky, one of nine children born to Samuel M. Long and Margaret Kinkead White. His mother was a cousin of Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn and Luke P. Blackburn. Three of Long's older brothers, Thomas, E. S. and Belvard, served in the American Civil War but Robert was too young. Long moved to Columbus, Kansas in 1873 where his uncle, C. J. White, was a banker. In 1874, Long met 19-year-old Martha Ellen Wilson. She was a Quaker and became a school teacher. After a year of courtship the two were married December 16, 1876. A son lived only a few weeks but the couple had two daughters. In 1879, Sally America Long (Ellis) was born, and in 1881 their youngest daughter, Loula Long (Combs; d. 1971) was born.  Career  Long started a hay bale company along with his cousin Robert White and a friend, Victor B. Bell; the hay venture failed but the three were able to sell the lumber from the hay sheds. Seeing that lumber was in demand they order more lumber. Business was good and the partners opened more yards. In 1877 the youngest partner, Robert White, died and the remaining partners bought out his share. Robert and Victor formed the Long-Bell Lumber Company in Columbus, Kansas. While in Columbus, he bought and developed a profitable coal mine with two shafts at Stone City. The location is found only on historical maps, as the town no longer exists today, but was just east of NW 40th street south of the junction of NW Meir road, which is northwest of Columbus. -Stone City = Long-Bell Lumber Company = In 1887, Robert A. Long and Victor Bell formed the Long-Bell Lumber Company in Columbus, Kansas. The headquarters was moved to Kansas City where it remained until sold. In 1889, Samuel H. Wilson, Robert's brother-in-law, that began with the company in 1887, took over the retail department, a position he held until his death on October 20, 1903. In 1891, the capital stock was increased to $500,000. The Long-Bell Lumber Company was vertically integrated from the forest to the lumber yard and became the world's largest lumber company in the early 20th century. Long-Bell Lumber Company filed for bankruptcy in 1934, then filed a reorganization plan in the Kansas City federal court in 1935, after Long's death. \\\\- Port of Longview History = Louisiana = When the railroad entered Louisiana Robert Long was among the earliest to set up shop. He purchased land in many parts of the state to begin lumber harvesting to supply the needs of his giant lumber company. In 1900, the Long-Bell Lumber Company organized the King-Ryder Lumber Company at Bon Ami, Louisiana. By 1904 the mill was producing 300,000 board feet of lumber daily which made it the largest in the area at the time. In 1903, Long-Bell organized the Hudson River Lumber Company in DeRidder and built a sprawling mill across the tracks from Washington street. Kansas City Southern Railroad and the Sante Fe Railway ran through Deridder. On March 16, 1906, Long-Bell Company bought out two mills of the Bradley-Ramsey Lumber Company in Lake Charles. This included and 36 miles of the Lake Charles and Leesville railroad and was renamed the Lake Charles and Northern Railroad. This purchase included seven locomotives and 120 log cars and a total of 58.599 miles of tracks. The new rail formed part of the Atlantic System of the Southern Pacific Company. In October 1906, a new location (sections 25 and 30, township 5, of range 8 west) was cleared along the route for the Longville Long Leaf Lumber Company and town. The company built the three-story, 60-room \\"Southern Hotel\\", 163 cottages for workers, a large commissary with $30,000 worth of supplies, an elementary and high school, a complete machine shop, roundhouse, car repair shop, and blacksmith shop. There was also a two-story fire department building, providing around the clock service, that started with a horse-drawn wagon then a fire truck, the First National Bank, a barbershop, and the Dixie Theater. -Longville Circa 1913, Long-Bell acquired the Ludington Lumber Company and transferred 3000 acres (for $157,000) to shore up the stumpage (uncut lumber) reserve. When the mill burned in 1920, there were an estimated 2500 residents in the town meaning it rivaled Fullerton. With the stumpage reserve dwindled the mill was not rebuilt so the town began to disappear. The planer was converted to a hardwood flooring mill, which was moved to DeRidder in 1927 when all operation at Longville ceased. = Unions = Unions had been operating in many industries, such as the railroads and coal mines in the United States as early as 1870, and played an important part in securing a better working environment and pay. Coal miners benefited from unions because their work under ground was poorly ventilated causing Pneumoconiosis also known as black lung (and even referred to as P-45),] was a fact of life. Railroad worker unions succeeded in getting rid of the \\"old man-killer\\" link and pin coupler. Union organization began at Carson, Louisiana, led by Arthur Lee Emerson and Jay Smith in December 1910. Other areas such as Lake Charles, Merryville, and Eastern Texas soon followed. They met in Alexandria in June 1911 to established the Brotherhood of Timber Workers (BTW). The Southern Lumber Operators' Association had been created by member mills in 1906 to stop any future union organizations. The association took immediately plans to include lockouts, importing strikebreakers, hiring the Burns agency, Pinkerton detectives, and other steps with the purpose of destroying the union. John Henry Kirby, that owned the American Lumber Company in Merryville, Louisiana, did hire agents to infiltrate the union. Other mills either imported workers or closed mills. After the incident at Grabow suspected union workers were fired. There were no laws to protect unions such as the Erdman Act for interstate railroad workers. The cases of Allgeyer v. Louisiana (1897), and the landmark case of Lochner v. New York (1905), called the Lochner era that did acknowledge that states have certain \\"police powers\\", but effectively took away a lot of state control, resulting in more company allowed controls. It wasn't until 1955, ending the Lockner era. Employees of many sawmills were required to sign yellow-dog contracts to prove loyalty to the company and agree not to join unions. The union office in Merryville was destroyed, and within three months union activities ceased. C. B. Sweet, of the Long-Bell Mills, chose not to honor the lockout. Sweet already paid his employees in cash and made other concessions and there did not appear to be any union action directed at the Long-Bell company sawmills in Louisiana. This was not to be the case with the Longview, Washington sawmill and other areas of the country. = Washington = He founded the city of Longview, Washington, a \\"planned city\\" built in 1923 near two of Long-Bell's lumber mills. He personally donated funds for the city's public library, first high school, train station, YMCA hall and its Hotel Monticello. The mills were advertised as the largest in the world. A newspaper was planned along with the city and on January 27, 1923, the first issue of Longview News came off the press.

It is the 73rd entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are defense workers at the Heedlock Airplane Corp., a pun on the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. In the opening scene, they enter an apartment and break into a safe, which turns out to be a refrigerator. With the food they find, they prepare a late night meal of a single slice of ham, an egg, bread and coffee. Moe and Larry share the food, and Curly gets the bone and the eggshell. While eating, Curly breaks his tooth while attempting to eat the ham bone, resulting in a major toothache. Moe suggests he simply gets some sleep, and in the morning the toothache will be gone. The boys situate themselves for bed in a three-tiered bunk bed. Curly naturally receives the top bunk and his ascent thereto is not without mishap: faces are stepped on, and an attempt to alleviate Curly's pain using a hot water bottle ends in a soaking for Moe. When Curly does finally fall asleep, we are introduced into his dreams where his persistent moaning and complaining about his toothache aggravate the other two into action. His fear of dentists leaves the Stooges to improvise their own brand of home dentistry techniques. These techniques include trying to extract the tooth with a fishing pole and line, tying the tooth to the doorknob and violently closing it, tying the tooth to a ceiling light fixture and jumping from a ladder, and lastly, firecrackers. As the dream sequence continues, Curly is taken by Moe to the dentist, Dr. Tug (Lew Davis). A terrified and belligerent Curly makes the check-up difficult. Exhausted from wrestling with Curly, Dr. Tug enters the adjoining office of his partner Dr. Yank (Bud Jamison) and asks him to complete the extraction. Meanwhile, Moe tries to placate Curly's fears by taking his place in the chair and simulating the procedure. Yank enters the office and‚Äîbelieving Moe to be the patient‚Äîknocks him out with ether in a rag and pulls his tooth, ignoring Curly's protests. Yank hands the extracted tooth to Curly and, upon learning that Curly is the real patient, runs out of the room. Moe awakens and finds Curly holding the tooth. This understandably angers him to no end and he takes it out on Curly, who attempts to defend himself. This flailing action in the dream translates to similar action in his sleep, causing him to fall through the entire bunk bed, which collapses in a heap on top of his two sleeping compatriots. Enraged, Moe gives Curly a solid slug to the jaw. This dislodges the problem tooth and all is well. The boys fall asleep where they lie amongst the bed cushions and splintered wood.

They are usually pale in colour, and have an abdomen that can range from yellow to beige. Both sexes range in size from . They are unique among common house spiders because their tarsi do not point either outward, like members of Tegenaria, or inward, like members of Araneus), making them easier to identify. The name is a reference to the backwardly directed process on the cymbium of the male palp. The species epithet is derived from the Greek , meaning \\"hand\\", and Acanthium, a genus of thorny-stemmed plants.  Venom  Though they are beneficial predators in agricultural fields, they are also known to be mildly venomous to humans. Painful bites may be incurred from species such as C. punctorium in Europe, C. mildei in Europe and North America, C. inclusum in the Americas, C. lawrencei in South Africa and C. japonicum in Japan. Cheiracanthium venom is purportedly necrotic, and can cause pain, swelling, and lesions in humans, but the necrotic nature and severity of its bite has been disputed. A study of twenty confirmed Cheiracanthium bites in the United States and Australia found that none resulted in necrosis. Some of these spiders are attracted to the smell of volatiles in gasoline. An unspecified Cheiracanthium species is reportedly attracted to the smell of petroleum and has caused problems by weaving webs inside the canister vent of particular models of Mazda vehicles, resulting in blockages and build-up of pressure that could potentially cause fuel leakage from the fuel tank and an increased risk of fire. Mazda issued a voluntary recall of Mazda 6 models built between 2010 and 2012, to fit them with software which would alert drivers if problems were developing. Species Cheiracanthium is primarily an Old World genus, with many species found from northern Europe to Japan, from Southern Africa to India and Australia. The only known species in the New World are C. inclusum and C. mildei. While the former also occurs in Africa and R√©union, the latter is found in the Holarctic region and Argentina. They can also be found in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada. The genus is quite diverse in Africa and at least three or four species are known to occur in Egyptian cotton fields alone. it contains 212 species, found in the Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe, Central America, Africa, Asia, North America, and on Saint Helena: *C. abbreviatum Simon, 1878 ‚Äì France, Denmark *C. aculeatum Simon, 1884 ‚Äì Africa *C. aden Lotz, 2007 ‚Äì Yemen *C. adjacens O.

Objective The aim of the game is to get Armadillo, a yellow basketball-like object (a stylized representation of a rolled-up armadillo) to the blue goal (a \\"Portal\\") by creating a structure using various materials that, when activated, will get Armadillo to the goal while keeping within a sometimes strict budget. The gameplay can be described as a mix of Bridge Builder and The Incredible Machine, and is certainly inspired by Rube Goldberg. Its creator, Peter Stock, cites Bridge Builder and Stair Dismount for the construction and dynamic natures of the game, respectively.Interview with Peter Stock Gameplay The main game has 50 \\"normal\\" levels to complete, and several bonus levels if the player has enough money to unlock them. Every level begins with the Armadillo, the goal, various nodes and, most of the time, some pieces which cannot be moved. The larger nodes are fixed in place; these are indestructible, and are used as mounting points. The player has access to rope, metal bars, metal sheets, cloth, rubber, elastic and rockets as machine building materials. The player can also change the tension of most of the components, as well as setting a timer for some of the components to break. In some levels, certain features or materials are not available. It is up to the player to ensure the structure gets the Armadillo to the goal within the budget for that level, and holds it there for five seconds. Each material has a cost associated with using it, and the player has a certain amount of money to use for each level. If they create a structure that gets the armadillo to the goal, but costs more money than the player has for that level, the player will fail that level. Because there is a virtually unlimited number of solutions for each level, players are encouraged to try to come up with the cheapest way possible to finish the level. Armadillo Run also has a level editor, and encourages players to share their levels with each other through the Armadillo Run website. Players can also share their solutions to levels through the website, so that if they are truly stuck, they can see how others have completed that level and attempt to complete it with more money left in the bank. Players can also create levels where the viewer does not need to edit anything (and sometimes cannot.) These levels display ingenious ways to complete the level, with everything from simulated rollercoasters to abstract car chase sequences, and show extensive use of the game's physics engine. Reception The game has been well received by reviewers; Metacritic puts its average review score at 88%.Armadillo Run at Metacritic It also earned a Gold Award from Game Tunnel,Armadillo Run review at Game Tunnel and an 88% from PC Gamer UK.PC Gamer UK, September 2006, pg 96 It was also nominated for the 2007 Independent Games Festival for both the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Design Innovation awards.2007 Independent Games Festival Finalists Announced, Gamasutra References External links Category:Indie video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:2006 video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Fictional armadillos ","title":"Armadillo Run"},{"id":"5982473","text":"The Minto Sailing Dinghy is a sailing dinghy first produced commercially in the early 1960 and still in production. Initial version The Minto Sailing Dinghy began its life as a skiff for a 24-foot sloop built by Hugh Rodd at Canoe Cove on Vancouver Island. The sloop was commissioned by a Vancouver Island printer who had made some money from an investment in the Minto Mine in British Columbia, and hence he named the sloop \\"Minto\\". After returning from World War II in 1946 Rob Wittlesey purchased the Minto and shortly thereafter traded the skiff, with \\"MINTO RVYC\\" carved into its transom, to Bob Schoen of Orcas Island for a smaller dinghy. First commercial fiberglass version The Minto skiff eventually got stored in Bob's barn, where his friend Heine Dole, a NW marine architect, saw it and convinced Bob it would make a great dinghy reproduced in fiberglass. Heine took the skiff to Ed Hoppen, the Gig Harbor boat builder who was the original builder of the popular Thunderbird sailboats. After cutting out about two feet and reshaping the hull, Dole and Hoppen used the old Minto skiff as the plug for the first fiberglass Minto mold. Initially the objective was to only build five boats for themselves, Bob Schoen, and some friends. Hull number one was destroyed in trying to remove it from the mold, but hulls two through six did survive and are still in use today. As interest in the attractive little boats grew Hoppen was prompted by numerous requests to put the Minto into regular production. Ed Hoppen produced a couple hundred EDDON Boat Yard Minto's in the early 1960s, and then in the mid-1960s licensed Howard Smith, the owner of Ranger Boats in Kent, Washington, to add the Minto to his increasing line of small rowing and sailing craft. Until Ranger was sold in 1999, \\"Smitty\\" produced about 1000 Ranger Minto's, becoming one of the most popular and recognized yacht tenders in the NW. Although the little steamship graphic displayed on the sails of the EDDON, Ranger and Rich Passage Boats Minto dinghies implies a direct link to the SS Minto steamship that operated on Arrow Lake in British Columbia for over 50 years, the association was created by Ed and Heine. They were looking for a way to make the new little fiberglass dinghy distinctive and they thought there was a similarity to the life boats used on the SS Minto and so chose the steamship graphic for the Minto. 2005 Revival In 2005 Rich Passage Boats, LLC of Port Orchard WA put the Minto back into production as the Rich Passage Minto, using one of the two former Ranger Minto molds. The Three Tree Point Yacht Club of Des Moines, WA has been hosting the Minto Mingle for 29 years. To see a video clip of the 2007 TTPYC Minto Mingle go to YouTube and search for \\"Minto dinghy\\".

Under the London Passenger Transport Board's 1935‚Äì1940 New Works programme, the station would have been built on the existing Great Western & Great Central Joint Railway (GW&GCJR;) line between West Ruislip and Denham, the extension's intended terminus. Like many other new stations built by London Underground in the outskirts of the capital, the construction of the station was intended to stimulate new housing developments in what was a rural part of Middlesex. Works on the extension were postponed during World War II and, after the war, green belt legislation was introduced to limit the expansion of urban areas. The area beyond West Ruislip fell within the designated Metropolitan Green Belt, and as the intended housing developments were no longer allowed the extension was cut back to West Ruislip; it opened in stages in 1947 and 1948.  Earlier station  The Central line station site, immediately west of the Harvil Road overbridge, was that of an earlier station on the GW&GCJR; line. That station opened on 24 September 1928 as Harefield Halt and was renamed South Harefield Halt in May 1929. It was served by shuttle trains forming the main line local service between Uxbridge High Street, Denham and Gerrards Cross. However, the station lay south of Harefield village and the building boom for which the later Central line extension was intended to cater had not occurred; usage was so thin that the halt closed again after traffic on 30 September 1931. The small goods yard closed at the end of 1952 and the site is now occupied by a commercial company: it has no rail access. The location of Denham East Junction lies immediately to the west of the old goods yard. No trace remains of the 1928 halt.

It is often incorrectly thought to be produced by Studio Ghibli due to the character designs by Katsuya Kond≈ç (who has worked on many Ghibli films), partially due to an error in its first fan translation that attributed the screenplay to Hayao Miyazaki instead of Akira Miyazaki, and the higher-than-average quality of the animation for a TV movie. However, Studio Ghibli had no involvement in the film. Story Ginga is a simple‚Äîyet energetic‚Äîcountry girl, living with her father far from the capital city of the empire in 17th century China. When she learns of an opportunity to become a concubine of the young new Emperor, with the possibility of getting a regular food supply in the bargain, Ginga convinces her father to let her go. Once there, she meets all of the other potential head wives, each of whom have various reasons for being there. All of them must learn to read and write, learn the history of their country, and learn the proper mannerisms for being in the royal court. Ginga's enthusiasm tends to get her in trouble more often than not, but it works to her advantage when they learn that the former emperor's head wife, who is not the mother of the current emperor, is plotting treachery against the new emperor, and that a rebellion is headed toward the capital.

It is a concept album, and contains one song divided into twelve parts and is noted for its darker mood and more progressive style. Overview A Pleasant Shade Of Gray is a single song that is divided into twelve tracks. The album is notable for its darker mood and mixture of progressive rock and metal with hints of industrial, classical, and psychedelia. Jim Matheos wrote the album following Fates Warning's 1994 tour in support of Inside Out, with Matheos mailing tapes to Ray Alder and Mark Zonder. The record was recorded after two weeks of live rehearsals. It took approximately one month in Carriage House studio with Terry Brown producing to complete the recording. Then-former Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera and former Dream Theater keyboard player Kevin Moore were recruited to complete the recording lineup of Matheos, Alder, and Zonder.https://web.archive.org/web/20160324075830/http://fateswarning.com/Discography/Albums/APleasantShadeOfGray.aspx Matheos said that the genesis of A Pleasant Shade of Gray's stark departure was the similarity of the previous two albums. \\"I think all of our records have been drastically different with the exception of Inside Out and Parallels [...] Looking back, that might not have been such a good move. We repeated ourselves and when we stepped away from it at the end of touring with it we weren't pleased with that; so this time we've done something radically different.\\" In 2007 the album was re-released by Metal Blade Europe with a bonus DVD of the Pleasant Shade of Gray Live video, previously only on VHS. Reception Sputnik Music gave the album 4.5 stars and noted that the album has held up well with the passage of time: \\"It wasn't until later that people began to regard A Pleasant Shade of Gray in a more positive light, and its popularity subsequently grew as the album is now considered inimitable in the progressive genre.\\" In 2005, the album was ranked number 416 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. However, Allmusic panned the album, criticizing \\"the guitar riffs and melodic hooks [as] simply not that memorable, requiring way too many listens before leaving any lasting impressions and overshadowing the band's remarkable musicianship [...] All told, A Pleasant Shade of Gray is a challenging listen and not for the faint of heart.\\" Track listing Credits =Band= Ray Alder ‚Äì vocals * Jim Matheos ‚Äì guitar, guitar synth * Mark Zonder ‚Äì drums * Joey Vera ‚Äì bass * Kevin Moore ‚Äì keyboards * Bill Metoyer, Lydia Montagnese, Mark Zonder, Terry Brown, Lindsay Matheos - additional voices =Production and art= Terry Brown - production, recording and mixing * Andy Katz and Joe Peccerillo - assistant engineering * Eddy Schreyer - mastering * Bill Metoyer - pre-production * Ioannis and Steve Jacaruso at Vivid Images - art direction and design * Ioannis and Heide Coyle - photography The credits thank former bassist Joe DiBiase, who departed the band in 1995; A Pleasant Shade of Grey was the first Fates Warning album without DiBiase.

Career Schiller was born in 1936 in Brooklyn, and grew up outside of San Diego, California. After attending Pepperdine College in Los Angeles, he worked for Life magazine, Paris Match, The Sunday Times, Time, Newsweek, Stern, and The Saturday Evening Post as a freelance photojournalist. He published his first book, LSD, in 1966. Since then Schiller has published 17 books, including W. Eugene Smith's book Minamata and Norman Mailer's Marilyn. Having produced and directed the 1967 Capitol Records audio documentary album Why Did Lenny Bruce Die?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ggWZj88fI he collaborated with Albert Goldman on the Bestseller in 1974 Ladies and GentlemanLenny Bruce!!, and also with Norman Mailer on the 1980 New York Times bestseller and the made- for-television motion picture of The Executioner's Song as well as in 1995 Oswald's Tale. His own books that became national bestsellers and made the New York Times Bestseller list include American Tragedy, Perfect Murder, Perfect Town, Cape May Court House, and Into the Mirror. He has directed seven motion pictures and miniseries for television; The Executioner's Song and Peter the Great won five Emmys. American Tragedy, Perfect Murder, Perfect Town and Into the Mirror were made into television mini-series for CBS, all of which Schiller produced and directed. In 2008, after the death of the writer Norman Mailer, he was named Senior Advisor to the Norman Mailer Estate and is the Managing Director of The Norman Mailer Center which he created with Norris Church Mailer. Schiller was a close friend of Mailer and collaborator on five of his works, and represents the Norman Mailer Licensing company. Schiller also serves on the Executive Board of the Norman Mailer Society.The Norman Mailer Society , official web site. Accessed April 2014. Following the June 12, 1994 stabbing deaths of O.J Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Schiller collaborated with Simpson, who was in jail awaiting his famous murder trial at the time, on a book called \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" which was billed as the former football star answering questions from fans about his life and the incident. Following Simpson's acquittal on murder charges, Schiller and former Time magazine journalist Jim Willwerth co-wrote American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense, considered one of the best books about the case. Dan Whitcomb, who covered the sensational trial for Reuters, worked for Schiller as a researcher on the book. In 1999 Schiller published a book on the JonBenet Ramsey murder case, Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,The Uncensored Story of the JonBenet Murder and the Grand Jury's Search for the Final Truth, based on an article he had published in the New Yorker on the same subject. Schiller served as a consultant to political campaigns and major corporations on such issues as crisis management, branding, public imaging and the use of social networking. Schiller has been an on-air analyst to NBC news, a consultant to Taschen Publishing, Photographers Annie Leibovitz Studio and Steven Klein, Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas and has written for The New Yorker, The Daily Beast and other publications. In 2005, Schiller traveled to China and over two years built a collection of Chinese contemporary art, which numbers over 80 paintings and photographs. In 2007, he showed his own photographs for the first time in the US at the exhibition Marilyn Monroe and America in the 1960s. It is for these photographs of Marilyn that Schiller is perhaps best known as a photographer. Schiller first shot Marilyn in May 1960 on the set of Let‚Äôs Make Love, and then again in 1962 when he was hired to shoot the star on the set of what would become the last film she would ever work on, the unfinished Something‚Äôs Got To Give. Marilyn & Me, Schiller's 11th book, commemorates his experience photographing the Hollywood legend, complete with 131 color and black-and- white photographs. In 2017 Schiller curated the John R. Kennedy Sentential for the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C. and the New York Historical Society in New York City. He also now represents the Jacques Lowe Estate of historical photographs of the Kennedy family from 1957 to 1964. And in 2018 he curated the Robert Kennedy - Martin Luther King, Jr. exhibition for the New York Historical Society. His current project is managing the 2020 Centennial of Ray Bradbury. Schiller resides in Newtown, Pennsylvania with his wife Nina Wiener, the Managing Editor of Taschen Books.

It is part of the Toronto District School Board. Prior to 1998, it was part of the Etobicoke Board of Education. Its motto is Virtus, Officium, Vertias (\\"Excellence, Service, Truth\\"). History The school constructed in 1961 and opened on September 4, 1962 to serve the growing suburb of Rexdale as Etobicoke's eleventh high school and its tenth collegiate. The North Albion school was designed by architects Craig, Madill, Abram and Ingleson. The high school has a variety of different clubs over the years ranging from the student council, year book club, Deca, Model UN, chess club. These clubs have been the foundation of this school since its inception. Although over the years some clubs dissipate as leadership over these clubs varies from year to year, many of these clubs have been around for a long enough period of time to create a culture that is lasting and creates an atmosphere that encourages creativity and success. The sports teams of these clubs have always been vibrant although the selection of athletes have always been limited due to the socio-economic class the school is surrounded by. However, the athletes have always managed to make the sports teams a major cornerstone of the school and has over the years achieved some incredible accolades due to the fostering of these athletes. Most notable is the cricket teams, volleyball teams and basketball teams that have come out from this school. The enrollment of the school is 842 students. This building can hold up to 1,095 pupils. On 23 September 2014, one of the students Hamid Aminzada age 19 was stabbed in the school hallway while he was trying to defuse a fight among two fellow students. He later died in hospital due to his injuries and excessive bleeding. Overview North Albion earned a reputation for academic and athletic excellence from the time of its inception through the 1980s. In recent years, discipline has improved and, as a result, the post-secondary success rate has been rising dramatically. From 2000 to 2004, the graduation rate rose to 40%. It is placed above other local schools such as West Humber Collegiate Institute, Thistletown Collegiate Institute, and Martingrove Collegiate Institute, as a school known for reasonable excellence in academics. Community involvement is shown by the Institute's contributions through the Student Government, Parent Council, Leadership Club, Breakfast Club, the United Way Committee, the Duke of Edinburgh Club, World Vision Volunteers, Crime Stoppers, and by its participating in community beautification days. An integral part of N.A.C.I. is the multi-grade, whole school Teacher Advisor Program that meets regularly. Although the area surrounding North Albion has been considered an area that has been plagued with violence the students have always been the cornerstone of this school as they've always rallied together through the hard times to overcome obstacles through the support of administration and faculty. The awareness within the community about this school has dramatically increased and it has now become a school that attracts over 1000 students through its doors every day. Its feeder schools include North Kipling Junior Middle School and Smithfield Middle School as well as nearby St. Andrew and St. Angela Separate Schools. North Albion became the first school in North America to offer Steel band as a full credit course in high school. =Building= North Albion Collegiate Institute is a two-storey secondary school in 12.16 acres of land, features 29 academic classrooms, six science labs, seven computer labs, two music rooms, an visual arts room, an drama room, three vocational shops for automotive and construction, a 750-seated auditorium, cafeteria with servery, three gymnasiums with the larger one that can divided, and a library. It also has a child care centre in the northwestern corner of the school. The building has a composite layout, like most high schools in Etobicoke built in the 1950s and 1960s, it has the auditorium located separately in the southwestern corner and the locker color accents of white, orange, gold, light yellow and blue. There are 12 fire exits located in the corner of the school. Crest During the 1962-63 inaugural academic year, the Hon. J. Keiller MacKay opened the school officially and gave North Albion its motto: Virtus, Officium, Veritas ‚Äì Excellence, Service, Truth. The Olympian torch and the book below the motto on the crest signify the struggle for the light of knowledge. The trees are for growth. We chose the mountain ash for its white flowers and orange berries. The triangle in the centre is a blue spruce to give us the school colours of orange, blue and white. =G.M Hull Award Winners= This Award is to commemorate North Albion C.I.'s former Principal Mr. Hull.

E. van de Wetering, 1938 - at the University of Amsterdam Album Academicum website is a Dutch art historian and an expert on Rembrandt and his work. Background Ernst van de Wetering was first trained as an artist at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in The Hague. He received his doctorate in art history from the University of Amsterdam. Since 1968, he has been a member, and is now chairman, of the Rembrandt Research Project. He was art historian on the staff of Amsterdam's Central Research Laboratory for Restoration from 1969 to 1987 and, since 1987, has been full professor of history of art at the University of Amsterdam. He has published extensively on historic painting techniques, as well as in the field of theory and ethics of conservation and restoration. In 1990, he succeeded Josua Bruyn as chair of the Rembrandt Research Project, the team of scholars that is charged with tracking down Rembrandt's works, authenticating them and, when needed, conserving the paintings. As of 2015, the project has published six volumes on Rembrandt's work, the known Rembrandts, and the techniques used by the painter. Assessment of Rembrandt In most of his writing and lectures, Van de Wetering portrays Rembrandt as a painter who struggled to create as many marketable paintings as possible, and whose studio turned out a large number of paintings with varying amounts of work by Rembrandt and his apprentices. He was also able to discover a number of Rembrandt's works which had been repainted by the artist to make them more commercially acceptable. In 2006, in celebration of Rembrandt's 400th birthday, Van de Wetering was quoted by the Associate Press saying: \\"My hope for the Rembrandt year would be that somehow we would become free of images, that we look with fresh eyes. So much research has been done, and so little of this research has come to the knowledge of the general public.\\" Studies of artists' use of light Van de Wetering is the voice of dissent when it comes to the significance of light in Dutch 17th-century painting. He doubts that it was a factor at all and says there were as many kinds of light as there were ways of painting. It was not a question of light, he adds, but of a painter's methods and style. He has also written several academic papers debunking the myth that Claude Monet painted only with natural light. Awards In 2003, Van de Wetering was presented with the Heritage Preservation/College Art Association Joint Award for Distinction in Scholarship and Conservation at Oxford University, where he has been a frequent guest lecturer. He was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford for 2002‚Äì03.

The Shi'is of Jabal \`Amil and the New Lebanon: Community and Nation-State, 1918-1943, p.34 Biography Born in Nabatiye into an illustrious family of scholars descended from the Safavids, he studied language and history under renowned scholars Hassan Yusuf al-Makki and Muhammad Ibrahim al-Husseini. Jaber Al Safa and his companions Sheikh Ahmad Reda (also his father-in-law) and Sheikh Sulaiman Daher, having formed an intellectual gathering known as \\"the Ameli Three\\", also known as the \\"Amili Trio\\" or \\"Nabatieh Trio\\", played a principal role in forming Jabal Amel's political and cultural history,Chalabi (2006), p.33 and were also the first in that region to speak of an Arab nation and of an Arab state.Chalabi (2006), p.34 Because of the group's violent opposition to the Ottoman rule, they were arrested in 1915, along with other Arab nationalist leaders such as Rida Al Solh and his son Riad, and imprisoned in Aley's military prison.Harris, William (2012).

Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World, Princeton University Press, p.39 Nationalists, prior to the revolt, were not secessionist. Rather, they called for decentralization and discussed nationalist ideas, while still positioning themselves within the Ottoman entity.Chalabi (2006), p.50 Jaber Al Safa credited the Ottoman state with losing people's support because of the harsh measures it implemented regarding conscription and, before that, its suppression of Arabic as an official and administrative language and related Turkification policies brought forth by the Committee of Union and Progress. Jaber, as part of the \\"Amili Trio\\", lobbied for Lebanon's union with Syria and opposed the French Mandate in Lebanon (he was briefly arrested by the French authorities for subversive activities but was released following widespread protests in Nabatiye in his support), remaining a supporter of pan-Arab unity until his death in 1945.Chalabi (2006), p.108-9 He wrote \\"TƒÅrƒ´kh Jabal \`Amil\\", or \\"The History of Jabal \`Amil\\", which is used as a main reference on the history of the Levant and Lebanon, and Jabal Amel in particular.Chalabi (2006), p.163, p.36 ƒÄl Safa is a descendant of the Safavids, a branch of whom left Iran following civil strife and settled in Jabal Amel.

All the persons stretched their hands saying: I would do it, I would do it. He (Muhammad) said: Who would take it in order to fulfil its rights? Then the people withdrew their hands. Abu Dujana said: I am here to take it and fulfil its rights. He took it and struck the heads of the polytheists. During the Battle of Uhud, Abu Dujana pierced into the enemy's lines, and even came within striking distance to the notorious Quraish leader, Hind bint Utbah who was encouraging others to mutilate the body of dead Muslims. According to various accounts, Abu Dujana spared her since he did not want to stain Muhammad's sword with the blood of a woman.History of Islam (Vol 1) By Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, pg. 173 Abu Dujana, during the Battle of Uhud, received several wounds in his back after placing himself around Muhammad so as to act as a protection from arrows. =Mention in other Hadiths= Abu Dujana is mentioned in other hadiths including in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim (see also 23:4887) he is found being served a drink by Anas alongside Abu Suhail bin Al-Baida' made from unripe and ripe dates.

Melanosis coli, also pseudomelanosis coli, is a disorder of pigmentation of the wall of the colon, often identified at the time of colonoscopy. It is benign, and may have no significant correlation with disease. The brown pigment is lipofuscin in macrophages, not melanin. Cause The most common cause of melanosis coli is the extended use of laxatives, and commonly anthraquinone containing laxatives such as senna, aloe vera and other plant glycosides. The anthranoid laxatives pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed until they reach the large intestine, where they are changed into their active forms. The resulting active compounds cause damage to the cells in the lining of the intestine and leads to apoptosis (a form of cell death). The damaged (apoptotic) cells appear as darkly pigmented bodies that may be taken up by scavenger cells known as macrophages. When enough cells have been damaged, the characteristic pigmentation of the bowel wall develops. The condition can develop after just a few months of laxative use.http://www.medicinenet.com/melanosis_coli/page2.htm However, other causes are identified, including an increase in colonic epithelial apoptosis. Endoscopically, the mucosa may show a brownish discoloration in a moir√© pattern. Histologic appearance On biopsy, melanosis coli shows characteristic pigment-laden macrophages within the mucosa on PAS staining.

Before founding Equal Exchange, Dickinson, Rosenthal, and Rozyne were managers at a food cooperative in New England, and were actively involved in American food industry reform. For three years prior to Equal Exchange's birth, the three founders met once weekly to discuss how global food trade could be changed to increase incomes and stabilize economic situations of farmers. The meetings resulted in the development of an alternative trade model that utilized direct trade, established long term contracts, and offered higher- than-market prices to small coffee farmers. This differs from the traditional trade model, in which buyers go through a series of middlemen to purchase coffee beans from plantation farmers.

Media Factory published 20 volumes between June 2004 and February 2011. The series was left unfinished due to the author's death in 2013, but was later concluded in two volumes released in February 2016 and February 2017 with a different author, making use of notes left behind by Yamaguchi. The story features several characters from the second year class of a magic academy in a fictional magical world with the main characters being the inept mage Louise and her familiar from Earth, Saito Hiraga. Between 2006 and 2012, the series was adapted by J.C.Staff into four anime television series and an additional original video animation episode. The first anime series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re- released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A manga adaptation illustrated by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in Media Factory's manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive between June 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by Seven Seas Entertainment in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created (one of them also localized by Seven Seas Entertainment), as were three visual novels. Synopsis =Setting= The fictional continent of Halkeginia bears similarities to Europe. ;Halkeginia : is the continent that the story of The Familiar of Zero takes place on. Halkeginia's social structure is similar to the feudal class systems of Europe in the Middle Ages, with magic-users being considered nobles. The continent itself is vaguely reminiscent in shape to western Europe, with many of the countries carrying ancient and Roman names. ;Tristain : is the nation in which the majority of the story takes place. It is a small monarchical country located in the northwest of Halkeginia and has come under threat from Albion. Tristain is home to a highly acclaimed magical academy known as the Tristain Academy of Magic, which attracts students from nearby countries. Militarily, the country is weak, with only a small permanent force, which forces it to make marriage alliances with other countries. The capital city is . The country resembles Belgium. ;Germania : is the largest kingdom in Halkeginia, and is also regarded as the strongest in terms of military might. It is regarded as a more barbaric and down-to-earth type of country, with its men considered to be brutish. Germania is located to the northeast of Tristain. Germania is the ancient Roman name for the region that is now Germany; the natives were at the time considered by the Romans to be barbarians. The country resembles Germany. ;Gallia : is another kingdom in Halkeginia, located to the southeast of Tristania. Germania is on its eastern border, in the Alden Forest. It is the second largest country in Halkeginia. Within the Gallia Royal Family, murders and assassination attempts have led to an unstable royalty. There is a city named La Rochelle in the mountains, which is a major port. The capital city is Beautis. Gallia is reminiscent of modern- day France, which in the Roman era was called Gaul (Gallia in Latin). One of its palace/fortresses is called Alhambra Castle, named after the palace/fortress complex in Granada, Spain. ;Albion :, nicknamed the white country, is an island nation which is in a period of political strife. According to the storyline, a group of nobles known as Reconquista initiated a coup d'etat against the royalty, and over the course of the story, succeed in killing the entire Albion Royal Family. Cromwell, the leader of the Albion rebellion, seeks to spread his power elsewhere, and begins by attacking Tristain. Albion is the ancient Greek name for the main island of Great Britain upon which are the modern nations England, Wales, and Scotland. The capital city of Albion is Londinium. :Cromwell is named after the leader of the Roundheads during the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, who successfully ousted the Monarchy, establishing a brief reign as Lord Protector until his death in 1658 prior to the return of Charles II. ;Romalia : is a holy empire, located to the south of Gallia. There lies a city called Aquileia. Reminiscent of Italy, and specifically the Papal States (and the Vatican City; it is mentioned that they have a pope and officials who are bound to celibacy), which once controlled much of central and northern Italy. Magic The nobles of Halkeginia are magicians known as \\"mages\\" or \\"magi\\", and must use a wand or a staff to cast spells. Not all magi are nobles, as some have been forcibly demoted or given up their nobility and use their magic for thievery or to work as mercenaries. There are four primary magic elements: Ignis (Fire), Aqua (Water), Ventus (Air), and Terra (Earth). Magi have an affinity to one of those elements. There is a fifth element, the legendary lost branch of element, known as void. Magi can combine different magical elements or even stack the same element on top of itself to make spells more powerful. The power of a mage is determined by how many elements he or she can combine. There are four ranks of magician based upon this factor. Those who cannot combine any element together have the first rank, which is symbolized as a dot. Most magic students are in this class. The ability to combine two, three or four elements together leads to a magic user being referred to as a line, triangle, or square mage. In myths, there is a fifth rank called pentagram mage. One of the major themes is that humans and technology from Earth displaced into the world of Halkeginia are considered to be highly magical, since Halkeginia itself has relatively primitive science and technology. For example, a magical item called the \\"Staff of Destruction\\" is, in reality, a human-made Vietnam-era M72 LAW rocket launcher. Other examples of Earth technology, often weaponry, appear throughout the story, such as a World War II era Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane. =Plot= Louise Fran√ßoise Le Blanc de La Valli√®re is a member of the nobility who is terrible at magic, as her attempts usually result in an explosion. She is nicknamed \\"Louise the Zero\\" by her classmates, due to her inability to use any of the four magic elements. Early in the school year at the Tristain Academy of Magic, the second year students perform a special ritual where they summon their familiar, which serves as their eternal companion, protector and partner, and is usually some sort of magical creature. But Louise summons Saito Hiraga, an ordinary teenage boy from Japan, leaving her totally humiliated. Due to the sacredness of the ritual, Louise reluctantly accepts Saito as her familiar, but proceeds to treat Saito as any other familiar, only worse: making him wash her clothes, sleep on a bed of hay, and whipping him with a riding crop whenever he upsets her. The Familiar of Zero follows the adventures of Louise and Saito as they help their classmates and friends, while occasionally blundering into situations where they risk their lives to save one another and Tristain. Saito tries to find a way to get back to Japan, but he also gains a mysterious power that allows him to wield swords and other weapons to perform heroic feats. They also eventually learn the truth behind Louise's magic inabilities. As Saito's and Louise's friendship grows and they start to work together, they ultimately fall in love with each other. Media =Light novels= The Familiar of Zero began as a series of light novels written by Noboru Yamaguchi and illustrated by Eiji Usatsuka under the original title Zero no Tsukaima. Media Factory published 20 volumes in Japan between June 25, 2004 and February 25, 2011. Further publication was threatened by Yamaguchi's advanced cancer, which he died from on April 4, 2013, leaving the series unfinished. Yamaguchi had planned the series to end with 22 volumes. However, it was later decided by the publisher to continue the series in the author's absence, due in part to calls from fans to continue the series, as well as Yamaguchi's family wanting to see it completed. Yamaguchi had dictated the remaining plot of the series, including its ending, and entrusted it to the editors. Media Factory released volume 21 on February 25, 2016 and the final volume 22 on February 24, 2017. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the series in 2007 under the title Zero's Familiar, but later cancelled the release of the novels before releasing any. A side-story, Zero no Tsukaima Gaiden: Tabatha no B≈çken, initially available as a mobile phone online serial, was released in three volumes between October 25, 2006 and March 25, 2009. It centers on the adventures of the character Tabitha, Louise's classmate. Another side story, Kaze no Kishihime, was released in two volumes on October 23, 2009 and March 25, 2010. It is a prequel about Louise's mother's youth. A companion volume, Zero no Tsukaima Memorial Book, was released on June 24, 2017. It collected various short stories and illustrations previously unpublished in book format, as well as character designs and other information, such as outlines for volumes 21 and 22 left behind by Yamaguchi. It also revealed that the last two volumes of the series were written by Y≈´ Shimizu, author of Bladedance of Elementalers, using Yamaguchi's notes. =Anime= The Familiar of Zero has been adapted into an anime series running for four seasons by the animation studio J.C.Staff. The first season aired in Japan between July 3 and September 25, 2006, and contained thirteen episodes.

Competitions are held for (i) the Open Piobaireachd, also known as the Clasp; (ii) The Highland Society of London's Gold Medal for Piobaireachd; (iii) The Silver Medal for Piobaireachd; (iv) Former Winners March, Strathspey and Reel Competition, or the Silver Star; (iv) individual event competitions for Grade A & B March, Strathspey, and Reel; and Hornpipe & Jig. Winners of the Gold Medal compete in subsequent years in the Clasp competition. A similar event is held at Inverness, Scotland, (the Northern Meeting) which is held usually two weeks later, in September of each year. Attack : In pipe band terms, attack describes the process of getting the band from a non-playing state to a playing state. In competition, the attack is often believed to set the scene for the performance that follows and therefore great emphasis is placed on it. The most common method is for the drummers to place two rolls, each lasting for three paces. On the beginning of the second roll, the band strikes in their drones and at the end of the roll, play a two beat introductory note, usually E. The attack is generally considered to have finished when the band has settled into their introductory tune, typically a few bars in. B Back D : The note played by the thumb hole of the Uilleann pipe chanter. It has a distinctive haunting quality, subtly different from the rest of the scale. Backstitching : An ornament in Uilleann piping. The stitch is two staccato gracenotes played above the main note pitch; backstitching is the process of playing several of these stitches on a series of melody notes. Bag Seasoning : Seasoning a bag keeps the leather supple, while allowing it to absorb moisture and keep the bag airtight. Bag Cover : The pipe bag is often covered with a cover, mainly for decoration but possibly also to help the player keep a grip on the bag while playing. Materials can include corduroy, velvet, or wool. Barking/Popping : On the Uilleann chanter, the effect created by playing a staccato note while simultaneously lifting and replacing the chanter on the leg. Also known as barking, as this is the sound created. Tuning Bead : Northumbrian pipe drones incorporate a tuning bead and/or slide which allows the player to raise the pitch of the drone by a whole tone to play in other keys. Biniaouer : Biniaouer means piper in the Breton language. Binio√π : Binio√π means bagpipe in the Breton language. Binio√π-Bras : Binio√π- bras means Great (Highland) Bagpipe in the Breton language. See Pib-Veur. Binio√π-Ilin : Binio√π-ilin means Uilleann Pipes in the Breton language. Binio√π- Kozh : Binio√π-kozh is the traditional Breton Bagpipe. Birl : Onomatopoeic name for a Highland bagpipe embellishment on low A, consisting of two very fast taps or strikes to low G. Blade : The vibrating element of a bagpipe reed. Reeds can be single or double; generally speaking, chanter reeds are double and drone reeds single. The blade is also known sometimes as a tongue. Blowpipe : The pipe through which the bag is inflated. Bombarde : A shawm-like instrument traditionally played in duet with the bagpipe in Brittany. Bottom D : The lowest note available on an uilleann chanter. Called Bottom D to avoid confusion with the two higher Ds available. It is obtained by lifting the chanter off the leg. Bridle : (On a double reed for a chanter) A strip of copper about 1/8\\" to 3/16\\" wide and 2\\" long with slanted edges used to control the aperture of the two blades of a reed. (On a reed single reed for a drone) A few winds of hemp or else some sort of elastic band to control the length and position of the vibrating tongue. Brien Boru Pipes : A 20th century attempt to create an instrument similar to the Highland bagpipe, but with an extended range that could handle popular Irish melodies. Several bands were formed, one or two of which still exist. C Canntaireachd : A system of non-lexical vocables, whose purpose is to encapsulate piobaireachd in a form which can be written or spoken while maintaining the precision normally offered only by written music. One of the most important sources in piobaireachd, the Nether Lorn manuscript, is exclusively written in canntaireachd. Ce√≤l Beag : Literally meaning little music, a Highland bagpiping term referring to, essentially, anything that is not piobaireachd. The term is of relatively recent origin. Chanter : Cimpoi : aka √áimpoi''' : a Romanian chanter with cylindrical bore and single beating reed. Also has a lower joint usually carved from horn that extends at approximately 45 degrees from the bottom of the chanter. Closed Bore : A chanter with a closed end at the bottom of the chanter. When all the finger holes are closed, the chanter cannot sound, allowing the player to play staccato. The Uilleann pipe achieves the same end by having the player rest the chanter on the leg, with the advantage that the lowest note remains available. Closed Fingering : A fingering system that generally involves only one or two fingers being lifted for any particular note. College of Piping : Founded in 1957 by Seumas MacNeill and Thomas Pearston. Located in Glasgow, Scotland, it publishes the monthly Piping Times, hosts a small museum, and runs an active teaching program. Combing and Beading : Decorative turnings consisting of more or less tightly spaced narrow circular grooves found on drones, mostly on Great Highland pipes. Cords : Decorative cords with tassels are used to link or tie the three drones of the Highland bagpipe together. Cran : An Uilleann piping ornament, consisting of a series of gracenotes of varying pitch over a low note, most commonly bottom D. Crow : A distinctive sound made when a chanter reed is blown in the mouth. The crow can often give clues as to the potential performance of the reed. Crunluath : The crunluath variation in piobaireachd consists of a series of crunluath movements played on the theme notes of the melody. The movement itself is a dramatic set of seven gracenotes which bring the tune to a climax. Crunluath a Mach : An occasional extension of the crunluath variation, with rhythmical and melodic changes, and a slight increase in tempo, creating a spectacular finish to a piobaireachd. Cut : (i) An old term for a single gracenote; (ii) to reduce the length of a note in a way not easily described by conventional music notation - for example, the cut note in a strathspey, normally rendered as a semiquaver, is described as cut and the resulting note is much shorter. D Dirk : A dagger, approximately long, normally only worn by Highland bagpipers in full dress. Dithis : Piobaireachd variation. Pronounced \\"gee-eesh\\" with a glottal stop, though this depends on the speaker's accent. Literally meaning two, or a pair, it is a variation of the Urlar or theme of the Piobaireachd. Sometimes used interchangeably with the variation referred to as Siubhal, though the terms do have distinct meanings. The Dithis generally consists of a series of longer theme notes, separated by short lower notes. It is generally followed by a doubling where the long theme note is repeated, but with the same rhythmic pattern as before. Double Chanter : A chanter with two bores and two sets of finger holes. On some, both bores have the same finger hole spacing and sound in unison. On others, one bore may have only a single finger hole and is used as a sort of alternating-tone drone. Double Gold Medal : Winning the two premier Highland bagpipe competitions (Oban and Inverness) in the same year. A feat only rarely achieved. Double Tone : When starting the bagpipes, as the pressure is increased, the drones initially sound at a higher pitch, perhaps a semitone or tone higher than normal. As the pressure continues to increase, the drones fully strike in at a normal and smoother pitch. This is deemed to be indicative of a higher quality reed. Doubling : (i) Two gracenotes preceding a melody note, bracketing a short gracenote at the same pitch as the melody note (thereby doubling the melody note). (ii) A restatement of a variation in piobaireachd. Usually slightly uptempo and simpler in form. Drone : Drone Switch : A drone switch, set in a common stock, allows the player to start and stop the drones at will. Drum Major : Traditionally, a Drum Major was the senior drummer in a pipe band and commanded the band on parade, rather paradoxically without a drum. Their role was to control the band when on parade. Nowadays Drum Majors continue to fill these roles, but are not necessarily trained musicians. E Embellishments : A common term for clusters of gracenotes which produce particular rhythmic effects. Music - a few Highland Pipe Grace Notes F False Notes : A recent term describing cross fingerings on the Highland bagpipe, used to create notes such as C natural that were not traditionally extant on the instrument. False Fingering : A Highland bagpipe term describing an error of fingering, typically where the player has not realised they have not lifted or replaced fingers after a particular note. Ferrule : A band made of ivory, imitation ivory, or metal, such as brass, copper or silver, mounted around the ends of stocks, drone joints and blowpipes to be both decorative and to protect the wood from damage. Flap Valve : A device that keeps air from backing out of a blowpipe when the piper takes a breath. The valve is nothing more than a flap of leather that is mounted so as to block the airway when air pressure becomes greater on the inside than on the outside. Bellows-operated pipes usually have two flap valves, one in the air-inlet (in one of the bellows-cheeks) and the other in the connecting pipe between the bellows and the bag. Flea Hole : A very small chanter finger hole most commonly found on Eastern European and Balkan pipes that, when uncovered, raises the pitch being played by the other fingers by approximately a semitone, allowing chromatic possibilities. Fontennelle : A rigid tubular cover that fits over the lowest key on some bagpipe chanters (notably Italian Zampognas), covering all of the keys except the very end of the actuating lever. Usually made of the same material as the chanter or the chanter's trim work. Free Hand Chords : A technique on the Uilleann pipes, where the player removes their lower hand from the chanter in order to play more elaborate accompaniments than normally possible on the regulators. G GDE Gracenotes : On the Highland bagpipe, a frequently used gracenote sequence, appearing in every type of music. It consists of a G, D, and E gracenote on any lower note. Grace note ''' : Whereas in classical music a gracenote would be taken to mean a note that has melodic significance, in piping, it means a very short note, perhaps not dissimilar to the acciaccatura. Grades : For competition purposes, pipe bands are usually organised into grades, usually from 1 to 4, with grade 1 being the highest level. Grip : A percussive Highland bagpipe embellishment, called leamluath in Gaelic, and sometimes called a throw if used to go to a higher note, e.g. B to C or A to E. Ground : The melody on which the variations of a piobaireachd are based. Also known as the Urlar. Goose : A set of highland bagpipes without the drones. Used to help learners get used to the bag once they have some experience on the chanter. Gooseneck bag : A bag with a long neck or \\"gooseneck\\" to the chanter stock. It is more comfortable for pipers with long arms. H Half Sized Pipes : A size of Highland bagpipe offered by 19th and early 20th century pipe makers. Now uncommon. High Hand : The hand playing the top of the chanter. The term is often used in the context of part of a melody which lies mostly on a single hand. Hornpipe : Historically, the hornpipe style was developed from the dance done by sailors, played on the hornpipe instrument. In the Highland bagpiping world, the hornpipe has become a favourite style of tune for opening a competition selection and the style has evolved to become similar to a reel; portmanteaus like 'reelpipe' or 'hornreel' are sometimes used to describe these tunes. I Imitation Ivory : A synthetic replacement for elephant ivory, which has been commonly used to mount and decorate many kinds of bagpipe. J Jig : A type of song, Generally faster paced and kind of rolls Joints : Generally, the word joint refers to a complete section of a drone, rather than the actual point of connection. K Korn-boud : Korn-boud means drone in Breton language (pl. kornio√π-boud). L La√±chenn : La√±chenn means reed inBreton language. See Te(a)od. Lapping : The process of winding hemp (a stout thread) onto a tenon or tuning slide in order to create a good seal between the two parts. Leumluath : (i) A (relatively unusual) piobaireachd variation. (ii) Another name for a grip movement (which is played in the leamluath variation). Levriad : Levriad means chanter in Breton language. Low Hand : See High Hand. Lowland Bagpipe : Another name for the Border pipes. This term is generally not used nowadays due to the possibility of confusion with the Scottish Smallpipes. M MacCrimmons : The MacCrimmon family are the traditional source of piobaireachd teaching and all players today can trace their teaching lineage back to this family. Their origin is obscure and shrouded in legend, but they were hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan by 1700, and were pre- eminent composers and players during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of their tunes survive and are played today. Mace : The Drum Major carries a mace to give visual signals to the band when marching. March : A tune especially suitable for marching to. Usually an uptempo melody in 2/4, 4/4, 6/8,9/8 or 12/8. Massed Bands : A number of pipe bands performing together, commonly after a competition or as part of a military tattoo. Military Tattoo : A signal sounded (as on a bugle or drum) shortly before Taps. Also evening entertainment given by troops usually in the form of outdoor military exercises with bagpipe music and massed bands. The annual Edinburgh Festival Tattoo is famous for its exhibition of pipe band marching and playing, including the Massed Bands finale. Mounts : Decorative trim on the wooden parts of a bagpipe. Its function is partly protective but its main purpose is decoration. MSR : A common abbreviation for March, Strathspey & Reel. The MSR combination has been a common one since the Victorian era and is a common competition requirement. N Neck : The narrowest part of the chanter, just below the bole or knob. Nicol Brown Competition : An annual piping competition in the USA founded by Pipe Major Donald Lindsay, in honour of R.U. Brown and R.B. Nicol, the two principal pupils of John MacDonald of Inverness, one of the main figures in piobaireachd tuition of the 20th century. Northern Meeting : An annual piping competition held at Inverness, Scotland, attracting the world's top pipers. The competitive events are similar to the events held at the Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, Scotland. About 30 applicants are carefully selected to compete for the Silver Medal. Winners of the Silver can compete for the Gold. Only winners of the Gold can compete for the Clasp or Seniors medal. The Northern Meeting is traditionally considered the most senior piping competition. O Off the knee : Playing with the Uilleann chanter removed from the leg, generally in a legato style. On the knee : Playing the Uilleann chanter resting on the leg, generally producing a choppier, more staccato style. Open Fingering : A fingering style in Uilleann piping suited to legato playing. Overblow : Generally, to cause a reed to jump an octave by increasing the pressure on it. Some types of bagpipe, particularly the Uilleann pipe, require this technique to achieve the full range of the chanter. P Pib- Ilin : Bretonazition of the Irish P√≠ob(a√≠) Uilleann, also Binio√π-Ilin. Pib- Veur : Bretonization of the Gaelic Piob-Mhor. See Binio√π Bras.

Popping : Lifting the uilleann pipe quickly off the knee for E, F# or G in the high octave. Popping Strap : A piece of leather, held on the Uillean piper's leg, used to achieve a good seal with the base of the chanter. Projecting Mounts : the wide mounts, usually found on the lower drone pieces, that have a decorative and protective purpose. Q Quick Step : A tune superficially similar to, and potentially interchangeable with, a 2/4 , suitable for a quickstep dance. R Redundant A : Older notation for Piobaireachd includes an extra low A note in taorluaths and crunluaths. Whether or not it was played is unclear, although there are certainly players today who still play it. Reel Pipes : A miniature set of Highland bagpipes, produced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Regulators : A regulator is a simple chanter which is played with the heel of the hand, allowing the Uilleann piper to play a limited chordal accompaniment to the chanter melody. Retreat : A relaxed, melodic tune in 3/4 or 9/8 time, played by highland pipers at the close of day in military barracks. It has no connection to military manoeuvering. Roll : An embellishment used in uilleann piping, consisting of two gracenotes on the melody note. The name derives from an analogous fiddle decoration. Rush : A wire that is inserted into the chanter. The rush effectively reduces the volume of the conical chanter below the desired hole. This causes the chanter to dampen or flatten the notes as far as the rush is inserted. Originally an actual rush was used for this purpose. S Sac'h : Sac'h or sac'h-binio√π means pipebag in Breton language. See Poch-binio√π. Scraper : A tool (knife) used to scrape reeds; the shape of the tool is critical. Seasoning : Another name more commonly used nowadays for \\"dressing\\". Second Octave : The upper octave on the Uilleann chanter. Seconds : A Highland bagpipe term for harmonies, usually based around parallel thirds. The effect is often intended to be textural rather than to have genuine musical merit.

See la√±chenn. Tenon : Connects the pipes to the stocks of a pipe. Tenons are typically wrapped with waxed thread. Cork, o-rings, and other materials are also sometimes employed for this purpose. Italian pipes use bare tapered tenons mating into tapered sockets, and screw threads carved into wood or ivory are also seen. Tempradura : A prelude played by Spanish bagpipers as a warm-up exercise; perhaps a prelude appropriate to set the mood for the concert piece. Throat : In a conical chanter, the narrowest part of the bore, roughly between the reed seat and the top hole. The shape of this is critical to the timbre, intonation, and performance of the chanter. Throw on D : An embellishment on the D of the Highland bagpipe chanter not dissimilar to the grip. Tight Fingering : See closed fingering. Tipping : A series of short staccato notes played on the Uilleann pipes. Tongue : The vibrating element of a drone reed which has a single vibrating element. Chanter reeds have two vibrating elements or blades.

Everflex is used on both hardtops and convertibles. Its usage was popular from the 1960s to the 1980s on luxury cars. Though its popularity has greatly decreased for new vehicles, it is still manufactured for restorers. The material is similar to the vinyl used on most vehicles, but is more durable and more expensive. On hardtop vehicles, fabric is placed below the Everflex material to add weight and body, often making the car look more like a genuine convertible. On older vehicles, a fabric called \\"Union Cloth\\" was used, but it quickly deteriorated, trapping water and damaging the Everflex material and roof. The Everflex is then glued down and can be screwed in around doors and windows. Three notable car companies that use Everflex material are Rolls- Royce, Bentley Motors Limited and Jaguar Cars.

Created in the time of the Empire of Brazil, the guardsmen are subordinated to the municipality mayors (prefeitos). Trained as a civilian uniformed agency, the city guards are responsible to police the municipal parks, properties, installations and the interior of municipal councils and city halls, according to the Brazilian Federal Constitution. Their patrols are called rondas (rounds) and there are 1,200 municipalities with Municipal Guards with more than 120,000 operatives according with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. They are treated as police officers by the former president of the IPA (International Police Association) Brazilian section, Mr. George Henry Millard. The former Brazilian Minister of Justice and elected governor of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Mr. Tarso Genro, asked for them to be given more jurisdiction for their operatives, and especially for their official recognition by Brazil as public safety workers. Legal basis The Brazilian Federal Constitution http://www.stf.jus.br/repositorio/cms/portalStfInternacional/portalStfSobreCorte_en_us/anexo/constituicao_ingles_3ed2010.pdf , Title III, Article 144, ¬ß (paragraph 8th) defines the mission of The Municipal Guards: ... #\\"...Protection of goods, services and facilities...\\" (ipsis literis citation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation ) #Organizing, directing and monitoring vehicle traffic in their territory #Ensuring the right of the community to enjoy or use public goods, obeying the legal requirements #Protecting the environment and historical, cultural and ecological heritage of the municipality #Providing assistance for domestic and foreign tourists Organization Vehicle of the Municipal Guard in Rio de Janeiro The Municipal Guards or Municipal Civil Guards had been reorganized from the original document of the Federal Constitution (1988), giving authority to the cities to create Municipal Guards for the protection of their goods, services and installations, and who are able to make use of the Law. Therefore, as a priority, they have to be able to act in these situations, but they also must be able to act in any other situation when crime is detected in the act, or threatens order or life, because in these cases, as the same Law, \\"any of the people can and the authorities & agents must act\\". Thus, even though it has divergences on the possibility the Municipal Guards' actions, the action is still supported by the Law. These organizations diverge sufficiently between one and another city. There is a common error which cites them as paramilitary organizations, when in the truth, the only reference to this type of organization in the Brazilian laws says that these paramilitary organizations do not have to exist. Therefore, the Municipal Guards are not paramilitary, nor need to have similarity with military organizations, although normally to be initiated under the command of military pensioners of the BMP, which generally don't act in the interests of the Civil Guard, presenting some traces of these organizations. These traces, however, are being questioned for their integration and, gradually, reviewed, because the guards, as many even though are autodenominam, are civil, and not military, thus do not need, to have military vices, crazes to form its hierarchy and funcionability. Civil Guard The Municipal Civil Guard is a type of municipal civil police which can be created by specific laws of the chamber of the councilmen of the city as an instrument for public security in the city. Its components possess the same prerogatives and legal obligations as the municipality's employees. The GCM, as it is known, can still assist the other agencies of public security, such as: the Federal Police, Federal Road Police, Federal Railroad Police, Civil Police, (including the Superintendence of State Scientific Police Service) and the Military Police including the Corps of Military Firemen. By a \\"s√∫mula\\" (Portuguese for \\"ruling\\", or stare decisis) of the Supreme Federal Tribunal, the scientific police are considered a branch of the Civil Police because of the principle of the indivisibility of criminal inquiry, fitting into the States of the Brazilian Federation that had conferred it autonomy, to subordinate it, again, to those institutions. In S√£o Paulo they receive the name Metropolitan Civil Guard. The use of navy blue uniforms for the Guards has been stipulated. In Rio de Janeiro it is only called only Municipal Guard and the uniform color is khakis. The Civil Guards are organizations of civil, not militarized organizations. Civil Guards of the cities with 20,000 inhabitants are authorized to carry firearms. Firearms are only allowed with legal authorization. The transport is granted by the Federal government (Policy Statute of the Disarmament). Up to 1965, the Civil Police of the most populous States of Brazil had in its administrative structure a full integration with the Civil Guard, but the police reforms in the beginning of the 20th century and designated them as preventive police, together, with the Military Police. These reforms were made more clear in the Coup D'√©tat on March 30, 1964; which ended autonomy in the Brazilian federal subjects (the Union, the Federal District, The States of Union and the Autonomal Municipalities). The idea was to eliminate any resistance against the military regime. The Great Goal of the act was the elimination of the Republican State Civilian Guardas as well as the Republican Municipal Civilian Guardas. The deriving government of the Military Coup of '64, establishing rigid control on the municipal and state uniformed police forces, extinguished the Civil Guards and many Municipal Guards too. They also succeeded in regulating the supervisory norms of the Army on the Military Police and nominated an official of the Army to command them in all the States.  Constititional Amendment There is a PEC (Proposal of Constitutional Amendment, PEC n¬∫ 534/2002) which would change the Brazilian City/Municipal Guards constitutional status. If approved, the good use of police power will be regulated to every Municipal Guard Corps to serve and protect the Brazilian cities and citizens, transforming these corporations into law enforcement agencies de jure (The Brazilian people consider the Guardas policemen de facto, and the Brazilian Ministry of Justice are treating the guards as constables. However, the Brazilian State Police Forces don't agree with this ideal- In deed, all the municipal guard operatives accuses the State sheriffs and colonels of interfering in the municipality autonomy. In Portuguese, this act is called \\"inger√™ncia\\"). The PEC was approved in the Brazilian Federal Senate and the Brazilian Federal House of Representatives Justice Commission (now it's waiting to be approved in the Brazilian Federal House of Representatives, in two voting sessions, with open vote).

She is well remembered for a bush-ballad poem,\\"Where the Pelican Builds\\".Adelaide (1988) p. 66. Early years Mary Hannay Foott was born in Glasgow to a merchant, James Black, and his wife, n√©e Grant. The family moved to Australia in 1853. Mary and her parents lived for some years at Mordialloc, near Melbourne, and she went to Miss Harper's school there. She was then one of the first students at the Melbourne National Gallery of Victoria Art School. She also studied painting under Louis Buvelot. Writings In 1874, Mary married Thomas Wade Foott, with whom she lived for three years in Bourke, New South Wales. In 1877, her husband took her up-country, to the Paroo River in South West Queensland. Her experiences there are described in one of her poems, \\"New Country\\", and her next seven years in that country had a great influence on her writings. Her husband died in 1884 through over-work and exposure during a drought of that year, when their losses of stock were so great that Mrs Foott was faced with selling her interest in the property and moving to Toowoomba, Queensland. In July 1885, Foott went to Rocklea, near Brisbane, where she opened a private school, which supported her family. In the same year she published a first volume, Where the Pelican Builds and Other Poems, and began to do journalistic work for The Queenslander and the Brisbane Courier. In 1887, she joined the staff of The Queenslander, where she wrote under the pseudonym \\"La Quenouille\\", but several stories also appeared in her own name. These have never been collected. Morna Lee and Other Poems, largely a reprint of her first volume, was published in 1890. Foott continued her literary work for many years at Brisbane, and from 1907 at Bundaberg, Queensland, where she died in October 1918. Foott's published verse was small in quantity but usually of good quality. One of several bush ballads she wrote, entitled \\"Where the Pelican Builds\\", appears in most Australian anthologies.Virginia Blane, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (eds), The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, pp. 382‚Äì383, Sons Foott's younger son, Arthur Patrick Foott, was a journalist, who enlisted in the 1st Australian Pioneer Battalion in 1916. A private, he was killed in action at Passchendaele in September 1917. She was survived by her other son, Brigadier-General Cecil Henry Foott, CB, CMG, who was born on 16 January 1876, educated as an engineer, and served with distinction in the Great War, being mentioned six times in dispatches. He commanded the 4th Division A.M.F. in 1929‚Äì1931, and died on 27 June 1942. Commemoration Foott Street in the Canberra suburb of Garran is named in Mary Hannay Foott's honour.

Plot summary Now a Green Rider, one of the king's elite troop of messengers, Karigan returns to Sacor City, giving up her merchant lifestyle. The story opens a year into this service as danger is threatening the kingdom of Sacoridia once again. The dark magic in Blackveil Forest is restless, and has found an outlet through the breach in the D'Yer Wall, which has protected Sacoridia from the forest for over 1000 years. This influx of magic has interfered with a land that has largely learned to live without magic during this time. Reports of strange instances of animals turned to stone and entire villages disappearing are brought to the palace from around the country. In the end the strange magic touches even the main city as suits of iron are brought to life and snow falls within the castle. Even the Green Riders' magic is affected, sending Captain Mapstone into self-imposed solitary confinement. As a result, Mara, another rider, and Karigan are left to lead the riders as best they can. Throughout the book Karigan has ghostly visions of Lil Ambriodhe, First Rider, and legendary founder of the Green Rider messenger service. Karigan meets with an Eletian prince and learns that she has wild magic within her that entered her as a result of her battle with Shawdell in the previous book. This wild magic augments her rider ability and allows her to travel through time, even visiting Lil Ambriodhe in her own time. Unfortunately, the magic also allows Mornhavon the Black to possess her. However, Karigan uses this to her favor-while Mornhavon possesses her, she transports him into the future, and, with the help of Lil Ambriodhe, she deposits him there. This buys the defenders of Sacoridia time to prepare for Mornhavon's return. With the weakening of the wall, Mornhavon's spirit reawakens in Blackveil Forest and begins to control the forest. Alton D'Yer is sent to fix the wall, but is betrayed by Seargent Uxton and knocked over the side of the wall into Blackveil. Mornhavon then possesses Alton and tricks him into singing the song that would destroy the D'Yer Wall, keeping him imprisoned. Mornhavon also raises two lieutenants from his army from the dead but they are later destroyed. Additional excerpts woven throughout the book are entries from the journal of Hadriax el Fex. Hadriax El Fex was Mornhavon's right-hand man and best friend. From the journals the reader learns that Mornhavon was once Alessandros del Mornhavon, a prince of a foreign land called Arcosia. He comes to Sacoridia to conquer the land and harvest the land's magic to prove himself to his father. He destroys the Eletian city of Argenthythe and many of the human cities. He is met with resistance and the war drags on for many years, becoming the Long War referred to in the book. Losing contact with his father and the empire of Arcosia, he feels abandoned by his father, driving his quest for ultimate power. He conducts experiments to increase his power and make a foul weapon called the Black Star. Hadriax increasingly dislikes the Long War and Mornhavon's experiments. It all becomes too much for Hadriax when Mornhavon sacrifices one of his elite units to power the Black Star. Hadriax joins the Sacoridian league and helps in the Eletian King's defeat of Mornhavon in the final battle of the long war. Karigan receives a copy of Hadriax's journal from Estral, who finds it in the archives in Selium. From the journal, Karigan learns that Hadriax had changed his name to Hadriax G'ladheon and that he is Karigan's ancestor. Overall the book more fully develops the characters met in the first book and introduces new characters that further the plot. Characters in \\"Green Rider\\"Karigan G'ladheon is the protagonist of Kirsten Britain's book series, Green Rider. She displays a strong sense of loyalty throughout all three books. First, by risking her life to continue F'ryan's mission and honor his request. It is hinted that King Zachary and she are developing a relationship. Among the Green Riders, the King's messengers, Karigan is fairly well liked and has many friends, two of which flirt with her and remove her boots, as well as drawing her a bath, when she comes back from intense training with the Swordmaster. *Lil Ambriodhe was the legendary First Rider, and it is revealed in First Rider's Call that she was carrying the king's child. However, she apparently had a miscarriage and lost too much blood to live. Lil shows determination and has a slightly comical, exasperated personality, even if she is but a ghost. Karigan is favored by Lil, and Lil even goes so far as to possess her to save her from an evil force, and nearly kills her in the process.

The reserve is located at the north-eastern end of Chatham Island, the main island in the Chatham Islands, close to Hanson Bay.  History  Hapupu was given to the New Zealand government in 1979 by Barker Bros (Brothers AND Sisters) Ltd. It is one of only two national historic reserves in New Zealand (the other being the Cook Landing Site National Reserve at Kaiti, Gisborne). The historic reserve designation reflects the particular importance of Hapupu culturally and spiritually for the Moriori of Rekohu (Chatham Islands). The momori rakau are among the few remaining visible signs of pre-European-contact Moriori culture. The carvings depict Moriori karapuna (ancestors) and symbols of the natural world, such as patiki (flounder) and the hopo (albatross). In a late 1998 review, 82 trees with carvings were found. Numbers of momori rakau have been steadily declining due to the aging of the host trees, stock grazing, wind and, in earlier years, people removing the carvings as souvenirs. The reserve was fenced in 1980 to provide protection for the tree carvings from grazing stock and this is now showing very good recovery. Planning is underway between the Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Moriori people to secure a small portion of the reserve for contemporary Moriori carvers to begin a new generation of momori- rakau. Barker Bros recently sold most of their remaining farmland, including that which surrounds Hapupu, to Hokotehi Moriori Trust, the mandated body responsible for Moriori assets, acquisitions and negotiations. The momori rakau have been the subject of much debate throughout the years mainly about the purpose behind them. One author has even released a book in 2007 in which he broadly claims that the carvings depict mainly birds and has even given these carvings a new name \\"manu -moriori\\" which could be translated to mean bird people. Chatham Island Moriori representatives are not supportive of the release or sale of this book as it is another example of someone making money out of the cultural and intellectual property rights of Moriori. Moriori do not consider themselves to be 'Bird People\\" either, but can rightfully claim synergy with the creations of nature all around them. Moriori have been the guardians of Rekohu since the dawn of time and were doing a good job until they were interrupted in 1791 by a European 'discovery.' The only recorded example of a Moriori committing a carving to a tree on the Chatham Islands dates back to the 1840s when a Moriori carved a tree on Pitt Island after burying his murdered wife and child next to it. This example also has no relevance to birds. References  External links  Moriori education resources * Pitt Island Pictures * J.M.

The term \\"bumper number\\" refers the combination of numbers and letters on the front and rear of a vehicle that uniquely identify that vehicle. There are many regulations that govern the use of bumper numbers. These regulations serve to standardize markings across the Army in order to improve efficiency and ensure markings add to combat readiness. The appearance of bumper numbers is a quick and representative sampling of the maintenance status of a unit. Proficiency in marking vehicles is an excellent indicator of deeper and more substantial efficacy of a unit. Bumper numbers also serve to provide a quick reference for identification and minimize confusion in the fog of war.  Applicable Army Regulations  US Army CCKW-353 truck displaying bumper markings. These indicate 3rd Army, 565th Anti-Aircraft Automatic Weapons Battalion, B Battery, 12th vehicle. Army Technical Bulletin 43-0209, Color, Marking, and Camouflage Painting of Military Vehicles, Construction Equipment and Materials Handling Equipment, standardizes how vehicle bumper numbers are applied. The markings are divided into four positions. Positions 1 and 2 are applied on the left, while positions 3 and 4 are applied on the right. The positions identify #The major command, organization or activity the equipment is associated with; #The intermediate organization or activity; #The unit that operates and maintains the vehicle; and #The specific vehicle number (often associated with the order of march). Anything beyond this policy such as assigning a specific number against a specific unit position is a matter of unit standard operating procedure. However, the number six has traditionally been associated with the commander of the element. For example, a Humvee assigned to the commander of Charlie Company would be designated \\"C06,\\" while the 1st Platoon, Charlie Company's command vehicle would be \\"C16,\\" 2nd Platoon would be \\"C26,\\" etc. Army Technical Bulletin 43-0139, Painting and Instructions for Army Materiel, gives information about applying ID markings over camouflage colors. Black lettering must be used over brown or green paint, green lettering over black paint, and brown lettering over white or tan paint. There are only two authorized methods of making bumper numbers: using adhesive vinyl (stickers) and paint. Army Regulation 750-1, Army Materiel Maintenance Policy, allows MACOM commanders to conceal bumper numbers in tactical conditions. Overseas commanders may comply with international agreements regarding vehicle bumper numbers. That's why some overseas commands paint solid light color rectangular boxes as the background for vehicle bumper numbers.

A graduate of Oberlin College, where she majored in classics, she was hired at Wilberforce University in 1858 as the first black woman college instructor and she was the first black American to teach at a historically black college or university (HBCU).She was not, however, the first black to teach at the college level. Three black American men taught at Central New York College prior to the Civil War, including George B. Vashon, a graduate of Oberlin College. The school was established by Gerit Smith and went out of operation just before the Civil War began. Wilberforce University, where Woodson taught continues in operation (as of 2018). Benjamin Quarles, Black Abolitionists, New York/London: Oxford University Press, 1969. She also taught for many years in community schools. After marrying in 1868 and moving to Tennessee with her minister husband Jordan Winston Early, she was principal of schools in four cities. Early served as national superintendent (1888‚Äì1892) of the black division of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and gave more than 100 lectures across five states. She wrote a biography of her husband and his rise from slavery that is included among postwar slave narratives. Early life and education Sarah Jane Woodson, the fifth daughter and youngest child of eleven of Jemima (Riddle) and Thomas Woodson (1790‚Äì1879), was born free in Chillicothe, Ohio, on November 15, 1825. Her parents had moved to the free state of Ohio in 1820 after her father purchased the whole family's freedom for $900. They left Greenbrier County, Virginia, where the Woodsons were one of only two free black families in the entire county. They founded the first black Methodist church west of the Alleghenies. In 1830 the Woodsons were among the founders of a separate black farming community called Berlin Crossroads, since defunct. The nearly two dozen families living there by 1840 established their own school, stores and churches. Her father and some brothers became black nationalists, which influenced Sarah Woodson's activities as an adult. Additionally, Berlin Crossroads was a prominent spot on the Underground Rail Road, with the Woodson's opening their home to many runaway slaves . Her father believed that he was the oldest son of Sally Hemings and President Thomas Jefferson; this tradition became part of the family's oral history.Woodson, Byron W., A President in the Family, Praeger, 2001, p. 86. Over two hundred years after newspaper reports appeared in Virginia newspapers indicating the existence of Sally Hemings' son named Tom, allegedly the son of Thomas Jefferson, professional historians such as Annette Gordon-Reed have ignored the existence of some of the newspaper reports and critically important content of the ones that they have acknowledged. Gordon-Reed and others are \\"hiding the balls\\", a practice that Gordon-Reed criticized other historians for doing in her book Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. According to professional historians, this was not supported by known historical evidence. In 1998 DNA testing of descendants of the Jefferson, Hemings and Woodson male lines showed conclusively that there was no match between the Jefferson and Woodson lines; the Woodson male line did show western European paternal ancestry. According to historians at Monticello, no documents support the claim that Woodson was Hemings' first child, as he appeared to have been born before any known child of hers. Professional historians have ignored the erasure of the name of a male slave, who was born in 1790, whose named was recorded in Jefferson's Farm Book by Thomas Jefferson and the survival of at least one letter of the name of the mother of the son in the Farm Book, as well. Thomas Woodson was born in 1790 and this time also matches the year of birth for the son named Tom attributed to Sally Hemings by newsman James Callender.\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", Plantation & Slvery, Monticello, Quote: \\"The DNA study found no link between the descendants of Field Jefferson [tested because Thomas Jefferson had no direct male descendants] and Thomas C. Woodson... But there is no indication in Jefferson's records of a child born to Hemings before 1795, and there are no known documents to support that Thomas Woodson was Hemings' first child.\\", accessed 6 March 2011. Woodson, A President in the Family, 215‚Äì17. Woodson showed an interest in education at an early age, memorizing every hymn sung by her family at age three and lengthy passages of the Bible at the age of five.Monroe Alphus Majors, 1864‚Äì1960; in Noted Negro Women: Their Triumphs and Activities(Jackson, TN: M.V. Lynk Publishing House, 1893), 102-103 In 1839 Sarah Woodson joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), founded in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States. Her brothers, Lewis, Thomas, and John were ministers in the church. The Woodson family emphasized education for all their children. Sarah Jane and her older sister Hannah both enrolled in Oberlin College in 1852. Sarah Jane completed the collegiate program, with a degree in Classical Studies, while Hannah enrolled in the preparatory program and left after about a year. Sarah graduated in 1856, among the first African- American women college graduates. Oberlin was one of the schools recommended by the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church. Career After graduation, she taught in black community schools in Ohio for several years and was the first principal at a public school in Xenia, Ohio. In 1863 she gave \\"Address to Youth,\\" to the Ohio Colored Teachers Association, one of a number of speeches she gave following the Emancipation Proclamation to urge African- American youth to join the \\"political and social revolutions.\\" She encouraged them to follow careers in education and the sciences to lead their race. When hired in 1858 at Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Woodson became the first African-American woman college instructor. While there she was appointed \\"Preceptress of English and Latin and Lady Principal and Matron,\\" making her a renowned teacher of English and Latin0. She was also the first African- American to teach at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and the only black woman to teach at an HBCU before the Civil War. Her brother, Rev. Lewis Woodson, was a trustee and founder of the college. It had been established in 1855 to educate black youth, as a collaboration between the white and black leaders of the Cincinnati Methodist conference and the AME Church in Ohio, respectively. Wilberforce closed for two years during the Civil War because of finances. It lost most of its nearly 200 subscription students at the beginning of the war, as they were mostly mixed-race children of wealthy planters from the South, who withdrew them at that time.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 259-260, accessed 13 Jan 2009 During the war, the Cincinnati Methodist Conference could not offer its previous level of financial support, as it was called to care for soldiers and families. The AME Church purchased the college and reopened it in 1863; this was the first African-American owned and operated college.Horace Talbert, \\"The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio\\", 1906, in Documenting the South, 2000, University of North Carolina, accessed 25 Jul 2008 She also served as Lady Principal and Matron.She was later re-hired by the university in 1866 following a nearly one year closure because of the civil war. After the Civil War, in 1868, Woodson began teaching in a new school for black girls established by the Freedmen's Bureau in Hillsboro, North Carolina.Jessie+Carney+Smith%22&source;=gbs_navlinks Jessie Carney Smith, \\"Sarah Jane Woodson Early\\", Notable Black American Women, VNR AG, 1996, pp. 198‚Äì200, accessed 6 March 2011 Though millions of black Southerners began to move to the North after the Civil War to escape violence in the South, Woodson was determined to educate the children of the freedmen. She was not alone, as many Oberlin alumni of both races, due to the school's commitment to anti-slavery ideology and activism, acted on similar commitments.Nat Brandt, The Town That Started the Civil War: The True Story of the Community That Stood Up to Slavery and Changed a Nation Forever, (Crystal Lke, IL, Delta, 1991). In 1888, Woodson Early was elected for a four-year term as national superintendent of the Colored Division of the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union. In 1893, Woodson spoke at the World's Congress of Representative Women in Chicago. Her speech was entitled \\"The Organized Efforts of the Colored Women of the South to Improve Their Condition.\\" Woodson was one of five African-American women invited to speak at this event, along with: Fannie Barrier Williams, Anna Julia Cooper, Hallie Quinn Brown, and Fanny Jackson Coppin. Her career ended with her death at the age of 82 on August 15, 1907. Marriage and family On September 24, 1868, Woodson, then aged 42, married the Reverend Jordan Winston Early, an AME minister who had risen from slavery. Sarah and Jordan Early had no children.

It is the 47th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are working as singing waiters at a restaurant and meet two doctors (Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell) who ask them to cheer up Betty Williams, a little girl who is sick from grief because her father (Ned Glass), a bank cashier, has been kidnapped while delivering $300,000 worth of bonds. The Stooges pay a visit to Betty dressed up as little girls with blonde sausage curls, but they fail to cheer her up. The Stooges then volunteer to go out and find the girl's missing father. The doctors give them a brief description of the father (middle-aged, bald-spot, an anchor tattoo, and 5'10\\" in his stocking feet). He and Betty like to yodel to each other, something Curly seems rather adept at. The Stooges waste no time in stopping every suspect in sight and giving them the Stooge third degree. Frustrated, Curly starts yodeling, and after a few maladies that befall him (water, a flower pot, and a chair all crashing on his head), the boys hear a response from a radio that one of the kidnappers, Butch (Cy Schindell), has on. Butch is guarding Betty's father who is gagged and tied to a bed. Mistaking the yodeling cowboy on the radio for the cashier, the Stooges follow the sounds and intercede, knock out Butch, and free Betty's father. Just then, three other members of the gang return. The Stooges and the father barricade the room door and use the dumbwaiter to escape to the basement. The four men follow them downstairs where a fight ensues, plunging everything into darkness, leaving only Curly fully conscious afterward to light a candle. The cashier is reunited with Betty, who recovers from her lethargy, and the pair, along with the two doctors, are serenaded at the restaurant by the Stooges.

He is the eldest of four honorary brothers (including the protagonist Kenshiro) who trained in the ancient assassination art of Hokuto Shinken. Following his introduction in Chapter 42 of the original manga, Raoh serves as Kenshiro's primary rival and adversary during a great portion of the series, being in the case, the main antagonist of Fist of the North Star, having already taken the mantle of , a tyrannical warlord that seeks to dominate the post-apocalyptic world. In contrast to Kenshiro's title as the \\"Savior of Century's End\\", Raoh is commonly referred as the within the story. Raoh figures prominently throughout the remainder of the manga following the conclusion of his story arc and would continue serving as a central character in related works published following the conclusion of the original manga and its anime adaptation. He serves as a central character in The Legends of the True Savior movie series and was the protagonist in his own spinoff manga and anime series Legends of the Dark King. His appearance is based on the Rutger Hauer as the replicant in Blade Runner. Character overview Raoh is the eldest of the four adopted children trained by Ryuken, the previous Hokuto Shinken master. The manga gives two different origins through the course of the story. In his first origin, Raoh and his biological younger brother Toki, were adopted by Ryuken after their real parents died. The second (and real) origin shows that a young Raoh and Toki, along with an infant Kenshiro, were actually refugees from the Kingdom of Shura who were sent to Japan to be trained in the art of Hokuto Shinken by Ryuken after their homeland was torn apart by a civil war. Raoh trained under Ryuken along with Toki and Kenshiro, as well as another student named Jagi. In spite of his ambitions to become the greatest martial artist in the world, Raoh lost the rights to the Hokuto Shinken succession to Kenshiro. Refusing to give up the style, Raoh killed his sifu Ryuken in combat and leaves to become the savior of the world. =Legends of the Dark King= With the aid of his childhood friends Reina and Souga, Raoh gradually builds his army. Later he conquers the Dungeon City of Cassandra and takes over Goram the Demon King's castle as his own while taking the name of . Among his many subordinates are his adoptive brother Jagi, the Toki impersonator Amiba, Uighur the Warden of Cassandra Dungeon, Juda of the Nanto Seiken school, and Ryuga, the elder brother of Kenshiro's fianc√©e Julia, among others. Raoh also took a giant black stallion named as his personal steed. After his attempt to recruit Ryuroh into his army, Raoh became more cruel in his campaign. Eventually, Raoh confronts Souther and the two battle until it ends in a stalemate and a temporary ceasefire between their armies. =Fist of the North Star and \\"Legends of the True Savior\\"= Raoh first appears in the story after Kenshiro and his allies have destroyed Cassandra. Raoh and his army begin to occupy Mamiya's home village afterward. Rei is the first warrior to challenge him, but he proves to be no match against Raoh and is defeated. He is then challenged by both, Ken and Toki, and managed to thwart both. In the end, Raoh fights Ken again and the battle between the two men end in a stalemate, with both too wounded to continue fighting. As revealed in The Legends of the True Savior segment, Legend of Raoh - Chapter of Love in Death, after being forced to kill Souga in a ruse to boost his army's morale and dissuade them from revolting, Raoh's army battles Souther's army until Reina is injured while saving an infant caught in the crossfire. Raoh then saves Reina's life by striking a pressure point and entrusts her to Toki, leaving with her the pendant she gave to Raoh when he left the Land of Asura as a child. After Souther's defeat, Raoh re- emerges to resume his \\"conquest of the heavens\\". He gauges the extent of his recovery by challenging Koryu, Ryuken's former rival for the Hokuto Shinken succession and defeats him. Raoh then challenges his brother Toki to a fight and defeats him, but spares his life out of sympathy because Toki was already dying from a terminal disease. Raoh later fights the warriors of the Five Chariots, who challenge Raoh on behalf of the Last General of Nanto Seiken. When Raoh discovers that the Last General is actually Yuria, he rushes to the capital of Nanto to capture her only to be confronted by Kenshiro, who has now mastered the ultimate Hokuto Shinken technique of Mus≈ç Tensei, the Unconscious Transmigration of Souls. Raoh manages to escape from Ken and takes Yuria captive with him. Vowing to overcome the fear he felt fighting Kenshiro, Raoh decides to challenge Fudoh of the Mountains, the first person who ever made him feel fear. During his confrontation with Fudoh, Raoh learns that the only way he can ever learn Mus≈ç Tensei is to experience true sorrow. Raoh decides to take Yuria's life to achieve, only to learn that she is already dying from a terminal illness as well. Feeling sympathy for her fate, Raoh is able to master Mus≈ç Tensei as well. In Legend of Raoh - Chapter of Fierce Fighting, prior to his final battle with Ken, Raoh kills some of the more power-hungry members of his army to ensure that his army would not be corrupted if he dies fighting Ken. Once at the Hokuto Renkit≈çza, the North Star Mind and Body Training Ground, Kenshiro and Raoh engage in a long grueling battle in which Kenshiro emerges as the ultimate victor. Raoh praises the strength Ken gained from fighting against other rivals before revealing that instead of killing her, he had extended Yuria's lifespan by a few years via imparting some of his spiritual energy to her. Raoh then jettisons his remaining life energy up into the heavens to restore light to the world proudly declaring, \\"I have no regrets for the life that I've lived!\\" After the final battle, his ashes are brought by Kokuoh-go to Reina, which she takes back to Raoh's homeland, the Land of Asura. Raoh's presence figures prominently in the story arcs following his death, as his influences is felt on other characters introduced afterward such as Falco and Akashachi. In the Land of Asura, Raoh was worshiped as a hero by the villagers, who saw him as their only hope against the corrupt ruler Kaioh, who is in fact Raoh and Toki's biological elder brother. The final chapters of the manga reveals that Raoh has left behind a son named Ryu. Voice actors Raoh's voice actors in the original Japanese versions of several Hokuto no Ken productions includes Kenji Utsumi in the original television series and 1986 film (as well as in a few video games), Tessh≈ç Genda in the CGI animated short film Legend of Heroes and the video game J-Stars Victory Vs, Takashi Ukaji in the Shin Ky≈´seishu Densetsu film series and Ten no Ha≈ç anime series, Rikiya Koyama in the PSP game version of Ten no Ha≈ç, Fumihiko Tachiki in the video game Hokuto Mus≈ç, and Masami Iwasaki, the voice of Ryuji Goda, in the video game Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise.

It is located in the suburb of Cranbourne, about 45 km south-east of the Melbourne city centre. Cranbourne Gardens specialises in Australian native plants. The total area of this division of the botanic gardens is 363 hectares, including heathlands, wetlands and woodlands. The gardens also provide habitat for native birds, mammals and reptiles, including some rare and endangered species.

The Home Garden shows a number of gardens featuring native plants for some common types of homes found in Australia. The Kid's Backyard uses natural plant materials recycled into a children's play area rather than the common plastic and metal constructions commonly found in Australian backyards. =Arid Garden and Dry River Bed= Kingia australis (Black Gins) in the Arid Garden These gardens demonstrate the role of water in the Australian landscape. Many parts of Australia are prone to alternating drought and flood. Thus plants have had to evolve to cope with extended periods of intense heat and dry aridity, and with either seasonal or irregular copious supplies of water. =Eucalypt Walk= Eucalypts are an omnipresent feature of the Australian landscape, with around 700 species found in virtually all habitats. The Eucalypt Walk features five gardens displaying some well known eucalypt species, the Ironbark Garden, the Box Garden, the Peppermint Garden, the Bloodwood Garden, and the Stringybark Garden. These trees are currently in an immature state, but will continue to grow to mature trees over the next century. =Other features= The Rockpool Waterway and Escarpment Wall are inspired by the types of waterways and escarpments that may be found in parts of central Australia, such as Uluru and Kings Canyon. There is also a display of Australian orchids in an undercroft below the Visitor's Centre, the Serpentine Path, and a Desert Discovery Camp in the Arid Garden for children to play and learn. The Australian Garden also has a visitor information service within the Visitor Centre, guided walks and educational programs, volunteer master gardeners to help with advice on the use of Australian plants, a gift shop and licensed caf√©.

It opened in 1968 with a construction cost of approximately US$13 million. Western Plaza was once a main shopping point in Amarillo, but from the 1980s to 2000s has suffered stores leaving its complex. It is demolished and a new shopping center is being built. The Western Crossings shopping center is estimated to cost US$40 million. History The mall opened with White & Kirk (a local department store), Woolco, and Montgomery Ward as its anchor stores. In the 1970s, White & Kirk was converted to Sakowitz, which in turn was converted to Dunlaps before closing in the 2000s. Woolco closed in the early 1980s and was replaced with H. J. Wilson Co., a catalog showroom that later became Service Merchandise. After Service Merchandise closed. Another notable tenant of Western Plaza was the first Hastings Entertainment store.http://amarillo.com/stories/2004/06/27/bus_hisear.shtml In addition, Western Plaza also had a business college, Academy of Professional Careers. Selling and demolishing On August 1, 2001, Triple Net Properties of California officially announced the purchase of the run down mall. They announced plans to rejuvenate Western Plaza., including bringing in new anchor stores. Cathy Derr, the leasing representative for Western Plaza was quoted in the Amarillo Globe news saying she hopes to have the mall up to 65 to 85 percent occupancy within the year. By late 2005 plans had been altered significantly. On November 29, 2005, The Sietz Group of Plano, a developer hired by Triple Net Properties, announced plans for a new retail center called Western Crossing to be built in place of Western Plaza. \\"We're going to completely redo it. We're going to tear it down,\\" said Carmen Dominguez, in- house counsel for The Seitz Group of Plano. Negotiations began to relocate the remaining tenants. In 2006, several problems arose. A tax abatement sought from the city to help with costs was unsuccessful. Asbestos problems increased projected demolition cost to $29 million from $27 million. And a former tenant, Texas Panhandle Mental Health Mental Retardation, sued the owners of Western Plaza for the more than $50,000 the local community mental health mental retardation center said it had incurred since being evicted to make way for a $29 million shopping center makeover. In June 2006, the signs of the mall were taken down. On June 7, 2007, demolition began and was scheduled to be done in 60 days. Rudy's BBQ, Cheddar's Casual Caf√©, Burlington Coat Factory, and a Starbucks location are all open. Michael's, Petco, Mardel Bookstorehttp://amarillo.com/stories/120908/web_mardel.shtml and other stores have since opened as well. The mall and its land have been owned by Santa Ana, California-based company, Triple Net Properties since 2001. Western Plaza's past owners include: Mattie Hedgecoke Properties, Southmark Corporation of Dallas, Texas, Spigel Properties of San Antonio, Texas, and General Electric Capital Corporation, the financial arm of General Electric.

While the measurement is applicable to any amylase, in general it refers to the combined Œ±-amylase and Œ≤-amylase used in brewing. The term is also generalized to diastatic malt extracts and separately prepared brewing enzymes. The abbreviation ¬∞L is official, but in brewing applications it may conflict with ¬∞L used for degrees Lovibond. JECFA, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, defines the degree Lintner as follows: :A malt has a diastatic power of 100 ¬∞L if 0.1cc of a clear 5% infusion of the malt, acting on 100cc of a 2% starch solution at 20¬∞C for one hour, produces sufficient reducing sugars to reduce completely 5cc of Fehling's solution. Note that the amylases used in brewing reach their peak efficiencies around 66 ¬∞C. Evaluation of a malt or extract is usually done by the manufacturer rather than by the end user; as a rule of thumb, the total grain bill of a mash should have a diastatic power of at least 40 ¬∞L in order to guarantee efficient conversion of all the starches in the mash to sugars.

He was born in McKinney, Texas. As a boy he worked for his father C.W. Furr and brother Key Furr at the Kirkland Mercantile Company in Kirkland in Childress County, Texas. He studied at Clarendon College in Clarendon, Texas, and the University of Oklahoma at Norman. He taught school until 1923, when he rejoined his father and older brother Key Furr in Amarillo to launch the Furr Food Stores. In 1929 Roy moved to Lubbock, where the Furr family bought six grocery stores from M systems, the continuation of the chain. After C.W. Furr's death, Key Furr, the older brother became president of Furr's, Inc., which grew rapidly, and at the time of Roy Furr's death it included sixty-eight supermarkets, as well as family centers in three states, fifty-seven cafeterias in seven states, 150 Cessna airplanes, 2 Falcon jets and a realty company in Lubbock. Furr was the chairman of the board of Farm Pac Kitchens, Rore Realty Company, and Crone Oil Company, all companies that he established as he branched out from his supermarket business using money from the family business. He also served as a director of the First National Bank of Lubbock. He was on the boards of regents of Texas Tech University, Lubbock Christian College, and McMurry College in Abilene, Texas. In 1961, McMurry gave him an honorary doctorate. Furr thought that the highest honor he ever received was the Great Americanism Award, which he accepted in the early 1970s from radio personality Paul Harvey as a commendation for his outstanding achievement in philanthropic work. He raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for various causes. Furr and his wife, Lela, had two sons and a daughter. Furr died on June 13, 1975, and is interred at Lubbock. The family business fared poorly after Furr's death due to the misuse and over-extending of his son Roy Furr Jr. In 1979, the company declared bankruptcy; the grocery business was sold to a group of West German investors and the restaurant business, Furr's Cafeterias, was bought by Kmart. Furr's Grocery Stores and Furr's Supermarkets C.W. Furr, Roy Furr's father, founded the retail operation in 1904 and operated the stores primarily in west Texas. Roy Furr entered the retail business, ultimately known as Furr's Inc., in 1923 and with his father and older brother Key Furr, began a grocery store expansion in 1929.http://www.lubbockcentennial.com/citysmost/020109.shtml Eventually the chain expanded into New Mexico. By 1978, the chain had grown to 140 stores throughout New Mexico and west Texas, primarily smaller grocery markets. In 1979, the German investment banker Rewe-Leibbrand obtained full ownership over Furr's Inc. In 1987, Furr's purchased the Safeway El Paso division, which added 59 stores and a warehouse. After the acquisition, Furr's operated 200 stores with annual sales of $2 billion. In 1990 Rewe-Leibbrand liquidated most of the stores in the Texas panhandle and sought to divest and find new investors for ownership of the remaining stores in New Mexico and west Texas. By 1991, the ownership of the company was 54 percent held by a Hamburg, Germany-based investment banking firm, 40 percent by the Fleming Companies (a Lubbock, Texas-based grocery supplier), and six percent by the American executive management team. The company, now known as Furr's Supermarkets Inc., moved its headquarters from Lubbock, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1979 the Furr family sold Furr's to a German company and the cafeterias to Kmart. In 1991, Furr's purchased 13 Safeway stores in New Mexico, and the company operated 75 grocery stores. By 1993, Furr's operated three divisions: Furr's Emporiums (the superstore operation), Bag'n'Save Stores (the grocery warehouse division), and So-Lo Stores (club warehouse-style stores). Through aggressive merchandising campaigns, Furr's was the primary grocery competitor to Albertsons stores, Kroger Corporation's Smith's stores, and Raley's stores in New Mexico and west Texas. In 1994, sales exceeded $1 billion. In 1995, Furr's sought outside investment in the company. Windward Capital Partners, a private New York equity investment group, acquired majority ownership of Furr's. In 1998, the Fleming Companies liquidated its ownership interest in Furr's, and subsequently Furr's Supermarkets acquired ownership of one of Fleming's distribution warehouses in El Paso in order to execute its own grocery supply operation for its stores. By 1999 Furr's operated 75 grocery stores in New Mexico and Texas with about 5,500 employees. On February 8, 2001, Furr's sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and then ultimately converted the filing to Chapter 7, thus liquidating all of its properties and ceasing business operations.http://search.lubbockonline.com/fast- elements.php?type=standard&profile;=lubbock&querystring;=%22FURRS%20SUPERMARKETS%20INC.%22 Some properties were acquired by Smith's stores, some were acquired by Lowe's Market stores, some were acquired by independent grocers and many were shuttered.

The film was based on the 1833 novel Eug√©nie Grandet by Honor√© de Balzac. Its sets were designed by Ralph Barton. Plot After the death of his father, young dandy Charles Grandet (Rudolph Valentino) is taken under the care of his uncle, Monsieur Grandet (Ralph Lewis). The miserly Grandet, despite being the wealthiest man in his province, forces his family to live in poverty and schemes to cheat his nephew out of his inheritance from his father. Charles falls in love with Grandet's daughter Eugenie (Alice Terry) but Grandet condemns their love, and sends Charles away. While Charles is away, Grandet kills Eugenie's mother, which sends him further into a maddened state. Later, it is revealed that Eugenie is not really Monsieur Grandet's daughter; if she knew, then she could reclaim all of the gold that originally belonged to her mother, leaving her father penniless. Monsieur Grandet has a violent argument with Eugenie, after she finds letters sent by Charles that her father had hidden, and Monsieur Grandet accidentally locks himself in a small room where he keeps his gold. He starts hallucinating and is eventually killed after becoming frantic. Eugenie is now left an extremely wealthy young lady, which only intensifies the pressure put on her by two competing families to marry one of the suitors. She announces her engagement, but shortly after is reunited with Charles.

Located on the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street, west of the Government House and north of the Supreme Court buildings, it contains a group of significant sculpture items. History Originally established by the Perth Vineyard Society in 1845 with Government approval, the Gardens were leased to Henry Laroche Cole for a ten-year period in 1846, and were eventually returned to Government control at the end of that period. In 1868 Enoch Barratt was appointed as the Government Gardener to tend Government Gardens (now known as Stirling Gardens), a position which he held until he retired in 1880. It is one of a series of landscape features that is classified by the National Trust. page 77 The statue of Alexander Forrest, the brother of Sir John Forrest, was constructed by Pietro Porcelli. It was first made in Guildford clay, then in plaster of Paris‚Äîsent to Italy to cast it in wax and finally in bronze. It was unveiled by Premier Walter James on 28 August 1903.

In mathematics, a set S in the Euclidean space Rn is called a star domain (or star-convex set, star-shaped set or radially convex set) if there exists an x0 in S such that for all x in S the line segment from x0 to x is in S. This definition is immediately generalizable to any real or complex vector space. Intuitively, if one thinks of S as of a region surrounded by a wall, S is a star domain if one can find a vantage point x0 in S from which any point x in S is within line-of-sight. A similar, but distinct, concept is that of a radial set. Examples Any line or plane in Rn is a star domain. * A line or a plane with a single point removed is not a star domain. * If A is a set in Rn, the set B= \\\\\\\\{ ta : a\\\\in A, t\\\\in[0,1] \\\\\\\\} obtained by connecting all points in A to the origin is a star domain. * Any non-empty convex set is a star domain. A set is convex if and only if it is a star domain with respect to any point in that set. * A cross-shaped figure is a star domain but is not convex. * A star-shaped polygon is a star domain whose boundary is a sequence of connected line segments. Properties The closure of a star domain is a star domain, but the interior of a star domain is not necessarily a star domain. * Every star domain is a contractible set, via a straight-line homotopy. In particular, any star domain is a simply connected set. * Every star domain, and only a star domain, can be 'shrunken into itself', i.e.: For every dilation ratio r<1, the star domain can be dilated by a ratio r such that the dilated star domain is contained in the original star domain. * The union and intersection of two star domains is not necessarily a star domain. * A nonempty open star domain S in Rn is diffeomorphic to Rn.

His son C.W. Stoneking is a musician. Childhood and education William Randolph Marshall was born in Orlando, Florida, on 31 August 1947. He was the second child of Charles and Florence Marshall. His sister, Barbara, named him \\"Randolph\\" after her favourite movie actor, Randolph Scott, and his mother selected \\"William\\" after an old family friend. The name \\"Stoneking\\" derives from his paternal great-grandfather, Reuben Stoneking (of Hundred, WV, Wetzel County). According to Stoneking's own biographical notes, his early years were spent growing up on military bases around the United States, including Randolph Field (Texas) and Fort Slocum (New York). When his father retired in 1961, the family moved to northern California where he attended high school in Folsom and Rancho Cordova, California. He graduated from California State University, Sacramento, in 1970, majoring in English with minors in philosophy and education. In 1972, Stoneking migrated to Australia. \\"The bumper stickers said, 'America, love it or leave it', so I left.\\"Marshall Stoneking, Billy Taking America Out of the Boy. Hodder Spectrum Books, 1994 In 1983, after more than a decade living in Australia, four years of which were spent living with tribal Aboriginal people 275 km west northwest of Alice Springs, Stoneking graduated from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in Sydney, specialising in screenwriting. Career =Teaching= After Stoneking arrived in Australia in 1972, he worked for many years as a high school teacher. His ties to teaching and pedagogy motivated him to spend four years at Papunya Aboriginal Settlement in the Northern Territory, during which time he collected stories for use in a bilingual reading program. Between 2000 and 2007, he spent seven years teaching screenwriting at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (ATRS). =Writing= Stoneking has published his poems in magazines around Australia, and was also active in the performance poetry movement, which included fellow poets Pi O, Amanda Stewart and Jas H. Duke. His poems have been featured in the Oxford Book of Australian Poetry (edited by Les Murray) and The Penguin Book of Modern Australian Poetry (edited by John Tranter and Philip Mead). He was also the author of seven books, including Lasseter, In Quest of Gold (published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1989), Singing the Snake: Poems from the Western Desert 1979‚Äì1988 (published by Angus & Robertson in 1990) and an autobiography: Taking America Out of the Boy (published by Hodder Spectrum in 1993). =Screenplays= In 1982 Stoneking entered the full-time screenwriting program of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Stoneking's first films were made in the mid-1980s, including a chronicle of his work at Papunya Aboriginal Settlement, Desert Stories. He also edited many television scripts, and was the co-creator/writer of Stringer, the AFI award-winning drama series. He also wrote a script for one of the episodes of Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series), which was broadcast during that show's two year revival (1988‚Äì1990). He also penned the full-length stage play Sixteen Words for Water. =Script editor, producer and story consultant= Stoneking was a teacher of dramatic writing. His \\"Drama of Screenwriting\\" workshop has been held in every capital city in Australia and New Zealand. He was one of the script editors on the AFI-nominated Australian feature Chopper (2000). Stoneking produced a number of small films, including Nosepeg's Movie and Jelly's Placenta. He was the executive producer of the documentary Gayby Baby.

The colouration of the three Pezoporus species and the kakapo is similar ‚Äì yellowish green with darker barring, somewhat reminiscent of the head and back of the wild-type budgerigar. This is not an indication of a true relationship, however, but either adaptation to a particular lifestyle or a feature retained from ancestral parrots; probably the latter as barred plumage is found all over the family, from the tiny tiger parrots to female cockatiels. When disturbed, a ground parrot flies swiftly just above the ground before dropping back into the vegetation. The presence of the bird is often only revealed by its characteristic dusk and dawn call, a clear whistling sequence of notes which rise in pitch before fading. It is silent in flight. Taxonomy Traditionally, two subspecies are recognized within the eastern ground parrot, but recent molecular studies show no genetic differentiation between the two east coast individuals and the individuals from Tasmania. Until recently, the western ground parrot was also considered a subspecies (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris) but is now considered a separate species (Pezoporus flaviventris).Murphy, Joseph, Burbidge & Austin 2010.

Description At Cooloolah NP, SE Queensland, Australia Up to 30 cm long. Plumage grass green, each feather with black and yellow markings; narrow orange-red band to forehead; head, nape, upper back and breast green, each feather with black shaft marking; feathers of abdomen, thighs and under tail-coverts greenish yellow with black barring; under wing-coverts green; primary coverts green; flight-feathers green with pale stripe across them; underside of flight- feathers with pale yellow wing-stripe; upperside of tail-feathers green with yellowish striped markings, underside brownish; outer tail-feathers yellow with brownish-black striping; bill greyish brown to horn-colour; cere greyish pink; narrow periophthalmic ring pale grey; iris whitish yellow; longish feet greyish brown; claws not so curved as other parrots. Immatures as adults, but with slightly duller plumage; orange-red band to forehead absent; head, nape, upper back and breast green, each feather with distinct black shaft markings; tail shorter; iris brown. Distribution Extreme southeast of Queensland to southwest Australia (scattered in small groups); Tasmania and some off-shore islands. Habitat Marshy coastal plain without trees, reed beds with low bushes, restricted to button grass areas; species may depend on naturally occurring fires allowing new growth and renewed settlement by the ground parrot. Status Only found in certain localities; threatened in parts of its range by cultivation of large coastal areas, but also foxes, cats and fire; alleged to have strong scent and therefore easily disturbed by dogs. Breeding A Taxidermied Eastern ground parrot Breeding period from September to January; (one record in March); nest consisted of an excavation in soil 15 cm to 18 cm across and 2 cm (0.75 ins) to 5 cm deep; usually well hidden under small bush or tussock hanging over nest to provide a form of hollow; mostly lined with leaves, grass stalks, fern and small twigs; clutch 3 to 4 eggs; incubation probably 21 days; chicks well camouflaged with thick greyish-black down and protected against cold periods; young remain in nest for two weeks approaching parents for food; fed three times daily; leave nest after three weeks at least disturbance; roost after 25 days outside under tussocks; cannot however fly at this point; egg measures 28.1 x 22.2 mm.

Approximately 580 high schools are members of MSHSAA. The MSHSAA conducts championship-level activities in 23 activities. At least 50 member high schools must sponsor a sport for an official championship series to be conducted. Sports such as boys volleyball, field hockey, girls lacrosse, boys softball, and water polo are considered \\"emerging sports\\" by MSHSAA, but an official postseason series does not exist with less than 50 schools involved in those activities. MSHSAA also administers sideline cheerleading and dance team activities. History The organization was formed in 1926 by a number of schools, both public and private, to oversee championship tournaments. Its first final was in boys' basketball, held that year at Washington University in St. Louis. MSHSAA removed the color barrier in 1952, allowing schools from the MNIAA (Missouri Negro Interscholastic Athletic Association) to join. In the late 1960s, the group unified football tournaments (previously only held locally) to form the Show-Me Bowl that exists today. School classification MSHSAA's member schools are organized into groups based on enrollment, with Class 1 being the smallest. In 11-man football the largest is Class 6, comprising the largest 32 schools based on enrollment. Schools wishing to play 8-man football must have an enrollment smaller than 200 total students. Boys' and girls' basketball each have five classifications. Class 5 schools are those with 1,175 students and above; while Class 1 schools are those with 119 students and below. Prior to 2003, the classes were divided into four classes from \\"A\\" to \\"AAAA\\" (popularly referred to as \\"1A\\" to \\"4A\\"). However, the number of classes varies by the number of schools that participate in a sport: for example, swimming and diving, speech, debate and theater, only have one class, while girls' softball and girls' volleyball use four classes. Schools in Missouri are able to form their own conferences and play whichever teams they wish in regular season competition. For example, the Ozark Conference, in the southwest portion of the state, has teams from two classes competing against one another. Schools are assigned into districts for playoff competition only; districts vary depending on sport, size and geographic location. Also unlike other states, there is no \\"regional\\" championship designation; during playoff competition schools are generally organized into brackets that are close in geographic proximity. Wrestling and track districts, for instance, usually have 10 or more teams due to the nature of competition, while football districts have anywhere from four to five. Beginning with the 2012 football season, districts comprised eight schools. In other sports, district competition is set up like a more traditional tournament bracket at the end of the regular season. The winner of the district tournament advances in the championship series. Redistricting and regrouping occurs every two years. Class 5 and Class 4 schools generally come from the state's major metro areas: St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, Joplin and Columbia/ Jefferson City, although there are exceptions. Class 3, 2 and 1 schools are generally rural, although some small private city schools are grouped here as well. Organization MSHSAA is headquartered in Columbia. 580 schools, both public and private, are members. Its current Executive Director is Dr. Kerwin Urhahn. MSHSAA is governed by a 10-member Board of Directors whose members are elected to four-year terms by school representatives in eight geographic regions of the state. Two at-large positions to the Board of Directors were added in 2005 to ensure racial and gender diversity. Potential changes to MSHSAA's By-Laws, such as eligibility standards and activity regulations, are voted on each April, or in special elections, by the Associations's 760 member schools. A process that includes input from more than 30 standing advisory committees, area meetings conducted throughout the state, and an annual questionnaire to the membership help identify issues to be voted on in the annual ballot process and identify issues for further study or modification. Member schools may also request specific changes to the Association's by-laws and constitution through a petition process that places the item directly on the annual ballot. The Association's by-laws fall into the following general categories: Bona Fide Student, Citizenship, Academics, Residence Requirements, Transferring Schools, Participation Limits, Entering School, Amateur & Awards Standards, Age Limits, Playing Under a False Name, Graduated Students, Nonschool Competition, College Auditions & Tryouts, All-Star Games, Recruiting of Athletes, Transfer for Athletic Reasons, Sports Camps & Clinics, Sportsmanship, and Foreign Student Eligibility. A three-level appeals process is in place for students not meeting the essential eligibility standards due to unusual, unforeseen or unexpected circumstances. Each of the state's eight geographic regions not only elects members to the Board of Directors and Appeals Committee, but also nominates representatives to the aforementioned advisory committees and elects three members to serve on each region's investigative committee. The investigative committees were formed to investigate formal complaints filed regarding suspected by-law violations committed by member schools. The Association publishes a quarterly magazine, MSHSAA Journal, and sponsors one of the nation's largest annual sportsmanship and student leadership events each August. In addition, MSHSAA has a number of recognition programs, including the Distinguished Service Awards program, Officials Recognition program, Scholastic Achievement Awards program, Student Advisory Committee, MSHSAA Leadership School program, Sportsmanship/Integrity/Leadership program, the 5-Star School program and Traditions reunion program.

This, however, has met resistance from most of the other parts of the state, especially St. Louis where the gulf between public and private schools is less noticeable than in KC. Instead of separate championships, MSHSAA used a 1.35 multiplier for school enrollments in determining classes for private schools. In addition, like in most other states, the enrollments of single-sex schools are doubled to better reflect how they would compete against co-ed public schools (hence, the \\"largest\\" school in the state according to MSHSAA's method is St. Louis U. High of St. Louis, which is listed as having over 3,000 students when in reality about 1,000 boys attend the school). Beginning in 2020, however, MSHSAA voted to drop the private school multiplier and instead elected to determine class placement for private schools on a sport-by-sport basis using a \\"competitive coefficient\\". Under this system, private and charter schools will be placed at a \\"floor\\" class based on their raw/doubled enrollment, and can be moved up to two classes higher based on performance in certain sports over a six-year window.https://www.stltoday.com/sports/high-school/mshsaa- members-vote-out-private-school-multiplier-in-exchange- for/article_fc2bd80c-946e-11e9-a649-2fc3f75282fc.html The most recent time the issue of a public/private split came up was in 2007, when a petition originated by Belle High School near Jefferson City was put to a vote by a group of public school athletic directors in St. Louis. While some believed that it would have a larger amount of support the athletic directors as well as the state board gave it a vote of no confidence before it went to the schools. When the results were tabulated, the petition was defeated by a landslide (over 200 votes). The State playoff formats have been questioned by teams from across the state. Objections over the four-sectional system have been made by both Kansas City and St. Louis area schools, generally over the disproportionate St. Louis-to-Kansas City sectional allocation (two-to-one) as well as the disproportionate allocation of St. Louis's most competitive teams into one division. MSHSAA had responded to these criticisms by forming a committee to devise a new playoff system in 2006, with the group proposing expanding the football knockout stage from 8 teams to 16 by including the top two finishers in a district instead of only the winner. This took place on an experimental basis in 2008. Gender equity Concerns regarding gender bias have been raised regarding the MSHSAA. For instance, girls' lacrosse is recognized by MSHSAA, while boys' lacrosse, despite having far more schools sponsor it, has to turn to the Missouri Scholastic Lacrosse Association for a tournament. Similarly, ice hockey is not backed by MSHSAA (it is run primarily by the Mid-States Club Hockey Association), but girls' field hockey is MSHSAA- endorsed. Competitive cheerleading was removed from the list of sponsored sports in 2006 after the dramatic fall and injury of a Southern Illinois University-Carbondale cheerleader, and MSHSAA now recognizes cheerleading as only a \\"sideline activity.\\" Broadcasting MSHSAA did not reach an agreement with Fox Sports Midwest to televise the 2015 state football championships. MSHSAA stated that Fox wanted money which they could not afford. However, Fox stated that the association went in a \\"different direction\\" with its media rights. The 2015 state championship games were available via a paid streaming service sponsored by the National Federation of State High School Associations.

History The station began operating in 1998 under the call letters WWND-FM, and carried a smooth jazz format as \\"102.9 the Wind\\". This setup was very similar in nature to one carried out by another station, WNND-FM 103.9 (now WNNL) from 1990 to 1996. In February 2001, the station began an all-1980s format as \\"Star 102.9\\", with new call letters, WWMY, following shortly thereafter. Goldsboro country station WKIX 96.9 soon joined the new WWMY in a simulcast as WYMY, simulcasting WWMY with 100,000 watts to points east of Raleigh as \\"Star 96-9 and 102-9\\". Over the next two years, Star attempted to tweak its format by becoming a hot AC hybrid for a brief time before switching to a classic hits format. It was during this time that the station carried the syndicated Bob and Sheri morning show, which did not go over well because it often got confused with the Bill & Sheri show on competitor WRAL-FM. The Star-FM simulcast broke off in 2003 when WYMY became a Spanish-speaking station known as \\"La Ley.\\" WWMY continued on with the classic hits format as \\"Star-FM - SuperStars of the 70s and 80s\\" until 2005, when it made another format tweak by picking up the oldies mantle from what used to be WTRG and changed their handle to Y102.9, which billed itself as \\"The Home of Motown, Soul, and Rock 'N Roll.\\" The musical focus then shifted on hits from the 1960s and 1970s. On February 1, 2007, WWMY began a simulcast with Goldsboro station WWNF 102.3, which shifted its country music format over to WKIX-FM 97.7 in Kinston. WWNF and WKIX had swapped call letters a month prior to the move. This was the first of a series of changes for 102.3 FM, as WWNF became WKIX once again late in 2008. WKIX and WWMY swapped letters early in 2010. As a result, the station dropped its Y102.9 moniker and referred to itself by just the dial position before changing it once again to the current KIX 102.9. In the process, the 80s tunes that had been on Star-FM previously were added back to the playlist, along with the occasional \\"lost oldie\\" from the pre-1964 era. WWMY ended its simulcast with WKIX-FM on October 23, 2010 and began stunting with future simulcast partner WKXU, as part of a change in city of license from Goldsboro to Smithfield. On January 8, 2014, Curtis Media announced that it purchased WKIX from McClatchey. WKIX would operate under a TMA with a new company to be run by Donna Curtis McClatchey, the daughter of Curtis Media owner Don Curtis.Curtis Media Shuffling Raleigh Portfolio from Radio Insight (January 8, 2014) The sale to Curtis Media's FM 102.9 LLC, at a price of $1.229 million, was consummated on December 1, 2014. WKIX-FM began broadcasting football and basketball games for the Duke Blue Devils, in 2010 after picking up the package from former WRBZ (now WPTK), which dropped sports programming altogether. This continued until 2015, when Duke flagship station WDNC added FM signals to cover the Triangle area. Other stations called WKIX The WKIX letters were used for many years by the Raleigh station now known as WPTK, followed by the Raleigh station now called WBBB, then the station now called WWPL and, after its first stint on the station now called WKJO, on the station now called WZKT in Kinston, North Carolina.

He was brought into politics by the first Chief Minister of Bihar, Krishna Sinha, when he was made parliamentary secretary at his insistence to the First Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1975, he died in a bomb blast at Samastipur railway station. The court case was delayed for years and was finally completed in December 2014.  Early life  Lalit Narayan Mishra was born on Basant Panchmi in 1922 at Basanpatti in Supaul District of Bihar. He did his MA in economics from Patna University in 1948. The young Mishra held nationalists Sri Krishna Sinha and Anugrah Narayan Sinha in high esteem. He married Kameshwari Devi and had two daughters and four sons, including politician Vijay Kumar Mishra.  Political career  Mishra joined the Indian National Congress party and was a member of the first, second Lok Sabha and 5th Lok Sabha. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha in 1964 to 1966 then in 1966 to 1972. He held various posts in the party and government. He was Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Planning, Labour and Employment (1957‚Äì60), Deputy Minister for Home Affairs (1964‚Äì66), Deputy Finance Minister (1966‚Äì67), Minister of State for Defence Production (1967‚Äì70). From 1970 till 4 February 1973 he was Minister of Foreign Trade. On 5 February 1973 he was made Cabinet Minister of Railways by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. As a Minister of Foreign Trade, he was one of the first to recognize the potential of future Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh and appointed him as his adviser at the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Their first meeting happened coincidentally on an India-US-Chile flight. Mr. Mishra the minister for commerce (then called minister for foreign trade) was on his way to Santiago, Chile, to attend a meeting of UNCTAD.  Assassination  As Minister of Railways, he visited Samastipur on 2 January 1975 to declare the Samastipur- Darbhanga broad gauge railway line open. A bomb explosion on the dais seriously injured him. He was rushed to the railway hospital at Danapur where he died the next day. Investigation and trial  Indira Gandhi blamed \\"foreign elements\\" for the murder, probably referring to the CIA. His brother Jagannath Mishra denied the claim that LN Mishra and Indira Gandhi had received bribes from the KGB as alleged in the Mitrokhin Archives; the Congress Party describes the book as \\"pure sensationalism and vague\\". On 26 July 2012, the Supreme Court stated that it will go into the causes of delay as even after 33 years, the trial was yet to conclude in the session court. As of July 2013, the 27-year-old man accused of the murder was 65 years old. Of the 39 witnesses he cited to prove his innocence, 31 have died. More than 20 different judges have heard his case over the years, supposedly on a day-by- day basis. After 39 years of trial, On 8 December 2014 four men accused of Mishra's murder were found guilty by a Delhi court. A fifth accused in the case had died. Three Ananda Marga followers, Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Gopalji, along with advocate Ranjan Dwivedi, were held guilty of murdering Mishra and two others. They were sentenced to life imprisonment by district judge and were fined amount ranging from Rs 25,000 and Rs 20,000. The court noted that Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, the religious leader of Ananda Marga, was jailed following his accusations in a murder case so his followers murdered Mishra to build pressure on Indira Gandhi government to release Sarkar. Sarkar was later acquitted. The court also noted that the six Ananda Marga followers met at a village in Bhagalpur district, Bihar and planned the conspiracy in 1973. In a recent trial, the High Court quashed the verdict of the lower trial court and all the four accused have been acquitted as the evidence provided by C.B.I. could not convince the High Court bench. Legacy A university, Lalit Narayan Mithila University, MBA institutes, L N Mishra Institute of Economic development and Social Changes, L N Mishra Institute of Business Management in Bihar, and a railway hospital in Gorakhpur, UP are named after him. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in his memory. Family Several of Mishra's family members are involved in public service. Vijay Kumar Mishra is an MLC of Janata Dal (United) in Bihar. His other sons are Dr. Binay Kumar Mishra, who is a retired ENT specialist, Sanjay Mishra, a businessman and Vikas Mishra, businessman and a social activist. His daughters were Late Smt. Bina Jha and Late Smt. Meera Jha. His younger brother, Late Dr. Jagannath Mishra, has been Chief Minister of Bihar for three terms.

It was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1983 to promote more uniformity and predictability between state laws relating to premarital agreements in an increasing transient society. The UPAA was enacted to ensure that a premarital agreement that was validly entered into in one state would be honored by the courts of another state where a couple might get a divorce. In 2012, the Uniform Law Commission promulgated the updated and revised Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act (UPMAA), which established procedural and substantive safeguards for marital agreements in an effort to bring them into accord with safeguards for premarital agreements. So far the UPAA/UPMAA has been adopted by 28 states and the District of Columbia: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The laws enacted by jurisdictions adopting the UPAA/UPMAA do have variances from state-to- state, but this uniform framework of consistent laws has certainly made it much easier for contract drafters to prepare legally-compliant premarital agreements by codifying the requirements. The UPAA/UPMAA has not been adopted in 22 states, although premarital agreements are still legal in these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming.

She is featured in Herbert's Dune (1965), and is a major character in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson and the 2008 novel Paul of Dune. The Bene Gesserit wife of Count Hasimir Fenring, Margot is first described in Dune through Feyd- Rautha Harkonnen's eyes: Dune In Dune, Count Fenring had been the Governor of Arrakis during the handover period between House Harkonnen and House Atreides. Margot leaves behind a note for her Bene Gesserit sister Lady Jessica, concubine to Duke Leto Atreides, in the palace on Arrakis: Jessica's own training alerts her to the true nature of Margot's message: Unfortunately, Margot's warning is not enough to stop the Harkonnen plot against the Atreides. Duke Leto is killed, and Jessica and her son Paul are forced to flee into the desert of Arrakis. Later in the events of Dune, Margot is sent by the Bene Gesserit to seduce Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and to \\"preserve the bloodline\\" by retrieving his genetic material (through conception) for their breeding program. She also intends to \\"plant deep in his deepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him,\\" which she later refers to as the \\"Hypno- ligation of that Feyd-Rautha's psyche.\\" As she and her husband discuss what a shame it is that Paul Atreides is dead (as everyone thinks he is at that time), Margot prophetically recounts a Bene Gesserit saying: \\"Do not count a human dead until you've seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.\\" Near the end of the novel, it is made clear that Margot has shared some of her training with her husband: \\"The Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth.\\" Hasimir subsequently refuses Emperor Shaddam IV's command that he kill Paul. Soon after, as Reverend Mother Mohiam watches Paul and Feyd-Rautha duel to the death, she comments on the existence of Margot's child by Feyd: \\"If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha's bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and Alia.\\" Margot has planted a command in Feyd-Rautha's mind through which Paul can paralyze him and thus win the duel easily, but Paul is able to win without using it. Seizing control of Arrakis, Paul deposes Shaddam, who is exiled to Salusa Secundus; Count Fenring willingly joins the former Emperor. Prelude to Dune Margot is a major character in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. =Dune: House Atreides= During the events of Dune: House Atreides, unmarried Margot Rashino-Zea is hand-selected by Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Mother Anirul to infiltrate the household of Abulurd Harkonnen on Lankiveil. One of the Bene Gesserit's best commandos, she knows sixty-three ways to kill a human using nothing but her fingers, and has also been trained in the ways of spying and ferreting out information, flash-memorization techniques and connecting mismatched tidbits of data to construct a broader picture. The Sisterhood hopes to find incriminating evidence, perhaps hidden there by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, that they can use to coerce the Baron into participating in their breeding program. Margot soon discovers that the Harkonnens have been grossly underreporting melange production to CHOAM and the Padishah Emperor Elrood IX, and are stockpiling it for their own purposes. Margot and her future husband Count Fenring later convince Emperor Shaddam IV to marry Revered Mother Anirul by explaining the benefits of an alliance with the Bene Gesserit. Through this arrangement the Sisterhood seek influence over the Imperial throne by ensuring that Shaddam will never have a son. =Dune: House Harkonnen= In Dune: House Harkonnen, Margot seeks out the Fremen on Arrakis in search of a group of Bene Gesserit sisters working on the Missionaria Protectiva, including the Reverend Mother Ramallo, who had previously disappeared. The manual from a Fremen desert survival pack called a fremkit, similar to the Bene Gesserit Azhar Book but \\"adapted to Fremen ways\\", indicates to Margot that the Bene Gesserit have integrated themselves into Fremen society and implanted the myths of the Missionaria Protectiva into Fremen culture.  Further works  =Sandworms of Dune= In Sandworms of Dune (2007), the second of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's two-part finale to the original Dune series, a ghola of Paul Atreides is created over 5,000 years after the original's death. Once his memories are restored, Paul recalls that after his ascension to the Imperial throne (between the novels Dune and 1969's Dune Messiah) he \\"had not been able to escape political struggles, assassination attempts, the exiled Emperor Shaddam's bid for power and the pretender daughter of Feyd-Rautha and Lady Fenring ...\\" =Paul of Dune= Hasimir and Margot are raising Feyd and Margot's daughter‚Äîwhom they have named Marie‚Äîas their own in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson novel Paul of Dune (2008). Between the events of Dune and Dune Messiah (1969), the Fenrings train their child as both an assassin and a Bene Gesserit, but reject the interference of the Sisterhood itself in favor of their own plans for Marie to seize the Imperial throne from Paul Atreides. Marie has Margot's blond hair and features, as well as Feyd's pale blue eyes. At age six, the Fenrings declare her ready. Marie is accepted into Paul's court as a playmate for his young sister Alia. At a banquet with her visiting parents, Marie and the Fenrings execute their well-planned assassination attempt on Paul. Alia manages to kill Marie, but Margot's revelation of her daughter's paternity surprises Paul enough to allow Hasimir to stab him mortally. Paul's concubine Chani uses the poisonous Water of Life to help save him, and he lives. Rather than kill the Fenrings, he banishes them to Salusa Secundus into permanent exile with Shaddam, whom they loathe. In adaptations Both Margot and her husband Hasimir are omitted from David Lynch's 1984 Dune. However, Hasimir plays a minor part in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune, and some of Margot's actions are attributed to Princess Irulan as part of Director John Harrison's expansion of Irulan's role in that adaptation.

Origin and distribution The santol is native to the Malesian floristic region, but have been introduced to Indochina, Sri Lanka, India, northern Australia, Mauritius, and Seychelles. It is commonly cultivated throughout these regions and the fruits are seasonally abundant in the local and international markets. Botanical description Open santol with seeds and pulp from Thailand There are two varieties of santol fruit, previously considered two different species, the yellow variety and the red. The difference is in the color that the older leaves turn before falling. The red appears to be more common and the reddish leaves mixed with the green ones add to the distinction and attractiveness of the tree. The fruits are often the size, shape and slightly fuzzy texture of peaches, with a reddish tinge. Both types have a skin that may be a thin peel to a thicker rind, according to the variety. It is often edible and in some cultivars may contain a milky juice. The central pulp near the seeds may be sweet or sour and contains inedible brown seeds. In some varieties the outer rind is thicker and is the main edible portion, with a mild peachy taste combined with some taste and the pulpy texture of apples. In others the outer rind is thinner and harder and the inner whitish pulp around the seeds is eaten. This may be rather sour in many cultivars, which has reduced the general acceptance of the tree. Most improved varieties have increased thickness of the edible outer rind, which can be eaten with a spoon leaving just the outer skin, and should increase the acceptance of the santol worldwide. The fruit grows on a fast-growing tree that may reach 150 feet in height. It bears ribbed leaves and pink or yellow-green flowers about 1 centimeter long. Uses The ripe fruits are harvested by climbing the tree and plucking by hand, alternatively a long stick with a forked end may be used to twist the fruits off. The pulp is eaten raw and plain or with spices added. It is also cooked and candied or made into marmalade. In Filipino cuisine, grated rind is cooked in coconut milk (with bits of pork and hot pepper) and served as sinantolan in Southern Luzon. The partly ripe sour fruits are also used as a souring agent in sour broth dishes like sinigang. In Thai cuisine this fruit is used to make som tam when still not fully ripe. It is also one of the main ingredients in the santol and pork (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô)‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô and santol and prawn Thai curries (‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á).‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á The wood of the tree is useful for construction, being plentiful and usually easy to work and polish. It makes a good shade tree. The leaves and bark have been used medicinally as a poultice. Several parts of the plant may have anti- inflammatory effects, and some chemical extracts from santol stems have shown anti-cancer properties in vitro. Extracts from santol seeds have insecticidal properties.Limonoid antifeedants from seed of Sandoricum koetjape Giniling na santol.jpgSinantolan from the Philippines File:Sinigang na bangus at santol (sinigang with milkfish and santol).jpgFilipino milkfish sinigang with santol File:Krathon somtam818.jpgThai santol som tam Intestinal obstruction and perforation Doctors in Thailand and the Philippines have warned about the risk of intestinal obstruction and perforation from swallowing the whole seeds of Sandoricum koetjape. One source claims there are about 200 cases annually in the Philippines. The \\"Bangkok\\" santol, a larger variety, may be responsible for more severe cases of abdominal surgery. Common symptoms are abdominal pain with peritonitis that requires surgery to remove the seeds. In one retrospective review, 6 of 30 patients with Sandorica seed-induced colon perforation died within 28 days following the development of septic shock. Cultivation Sandoricum is a tree of humid tropical regions that grows from sea level to an elevation of above sea level. It grows better in deep and organic grounds, and with rainfall distributed throughout the year, although it also tolerates long, dry periods. The distance of planting from each other is . It requires fertilization two times a year so it can grow better. Normally, seed trees produce fruit after 5 or 7 years of age, though some cultivars need only 3 or 4. The santol is a very productive tree. A mature tree can produce between 18,000 and 24,000 fruits per year. In Puerto Rico it produces in the months of August and September.

They are one of the largest and most prominent Italian American groups in the United States.Laura C. Rudolph, \\"Sicilian Americans.\\" History A Sicilian caf√© in New York, 1889. Sicilian emigration to the US grew substantially starting in the 1880s to 1914, when it was cut off by the World War. Many Sicilians planned to return home after a few years making money in the United States, but the wartime delay allowed many to assimilate into better jobs and wartime experience, so they did not return. By 1924, about 4,000,000 Sicilians emigrated to the US, And several million returned.. The Emergency Quota Act, and the subsequent Immigration Act of 1924 sharply reduced immigration from Southern Europe except for relatives of Sicilians already in the U.S. This period saw political and economic shifts in Sicily that made emigration desirable. There was also a large wave of immigration after World War II. A great portion of the Sicilian immigrants would settle in New York City, New Jersey, New Haven, Buffalo, Rochester, Erie, Tampa, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Boston, Pittston, Johnston, Rhode Island, Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, Milwaukee, and Birmingham.  Culture  Sicilian immigrants brought with them their own unique culture, including theatre and music. Giovanni De Rosalia was a noted Sicilian American playwright in the early period and farce was popular in several Sicilian dominated theatres. In music Sicilian Americans would be linked, to some extent, to jazz. Many of the more popular cities for Sicilian immigrants, like Brooklyn, New Orleans or Chicago, are pivotal in the history of jazz. In Brooklyn the predominantly Sicilian neighborhoods were Bensonhurst and Gravesend, In Chicago \\"Little Sicily\\" and in New Orleans it was \\"Little Palermo.\\" One of the earliest, and among the most controversial, figures in jazz was Nick LaRocca, who was of Sicilian heritage. Modern Sicilian American jazz artists include Bobby Militello and Chuck Mangione.Laura C. Rudolph, \\"Sicilian Americans.\\" Film director Frank Capra, a native of Bisacquino, Sicily The Sicilian-American respect for San Giuseppe (St. Joseph) is reflected in the celebration of the Feast of St. Joseph, primarily in New Orleans and Buffalo, every March 19. Many families in those cities prepare a \\"St. Joseph's Day table\\", at which relatives or neighbors portray Jesus, Joseph and Mary and oversee the serving of meat-free Lenten meals to the poor of the community. The tables are the vestiges of a Sicilian legend which states that farmers prayed to St. Joseph, promising that if he interceded in a drought, they would share their bounty with the poor. The foods served at such tables include: pasta con sarde (spaghetti with sardines); lenticchie (lentils); and various froscie (omelettes) made with cardoon (wild artichoke), cicoria (dandelion) and other homely vegetables. Desserts include sfingi, zeppoli, a light puff pastry; sfogliatelle, pignolati, struffoli (honey balls); and cannoli, a Sicilian creation. One tradition has each guest at a St. Joseph's Day table receiving a slice of orange, a bit of fennel and a fava bean, for good luck.Laura C.

Writer and historian Rica Erickson was the head compiler of the books and coordinator of the project which ran from the late 1960s to 1988. The editorial committee included Reg Appleyard, Geoffrey Bolton, Margaret Medcalf, Tom Stannage, Pamela Statham, and Sandra Taylor. Few states in Australia have been in a position to undertake such a project due to a lack of records and other logistical issues. However the presence, and comprehensive holdings of the volumes of the Western Australia Post Office Directory (which commenced in 1893) have facilitated the checking of names and locations. The volumes are held as basic reference items in the State Records Office, the J S Battye Library and many public libraries throughout the state. Western Australia's population in 1850 was approximately 5,000. In 1850, the first of approximately 9,600 convicts arrived and these continued until 1868. With a similar number of free settler arrivals during the convict period, the state's population swelled nearly fivefold in less than 20 years. The discovery of gold in the Kalgoorlie area of Western Australia in the 1880s led to further significant population growth during that period. For these reasons, the first series was separated by the significant years of 1850, 1868 and 1888. The combined series contain basic biographical details of over 20,000 individuals. The Western Australian Biographical Index In the late 1960s, historian, author and genealogist, Rica Erickson, who had previously authored a number of important books and papers relating to Western Australia's history, considered an expansion of her own historical records: In the early 1970s Erickson started working on establishing The Western Australian Biographical Index with the assistance of government funding. Requests seeking material were sent out through local libraries, historical groups and the local press in which members of the public were asked to provide genealogical information from the 19th century up to 1914 from their family records including arrivals in Western Australia, occupations, dates of birth, marriages and deaths of their ancestors. Historical material such as diaries, letters, business records, minute books, maps, family trees and photographs, were also sought for copying. Information relating to ordinary citizens, rather than just prominent identities was sought. Submissions for the index closed in December 1979. The highly successful project quickly accumulated vast quantities of primary source material. Additional data was collected through passenger lists, church registers, almanacs and directories, the index to the WA Government Gazettes, and old newspapers. All the information was condensed and handwritten on individual cards and sorted alphabetically by surname and filed at the J S Battye Library on microfilm. Originally, it was planned that the Western Australian Biographical Index would be copied and made available in a limited number of locations including the J S Battye Library and some major country towns. As the information and interest grew it was decided to produce it in published form. Dictionary of Western Australians Using the Western Australian Biographical Index its source, the Dictionary series was produced in five volumes, the first three of which were published in time for Western Australia's sesquicentennial year of European settlement in 1979. The fourth and fifth volumes were published in 1985 and 1987. The five volumes were entitled: * Volume 1, Early Settlers 1829‚Äì1850 * Volume 2, Bond 1850‚Äì1868 * Volume 3, Free 1850‚Äì1868 * Volume 4, The Challenging Years 1869‚Äì1888 * Volume 5, The Golden Years Volume 1 was based largely on an extensive card index catalogue which had been collected over many years by Hazel Statham, and compiled by her daughter Pamela Statham. It covered the period of free settlement up to the start of the Convict era of Western Australia in 1850. Volumes two and three covered the arrivals of convicts and free settlers, both during the period of convict arrivals respectively. Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians The Bicentennial series was done in response to continuing public interest in supplying genealogical material to the original Dictionary project team which had accumulated significant additional data which needed to be added to the original series. Due to the quantity of the additional material it was decided to publish an entire new series rather than a supplement to the earlier series. The project received federal government funding as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988. The first part of the bicentennial series was published in five volumes as follows: * Volume I, pre-1829‚Äì1888 A‚ÄìC * Volume II, pre-1829‚Äì1888 D‚ÄìJ * Volume III, pre-1829‚Äì1888 K‚ÄìQ * Volume IV, pre-1829‚Äì1888 R‚ÄìZ * Volume V, Asian immigrants to Western Australia, 1829‚Äì1901 (1988, Anne Atkinson, ) The second part of the series (volumes VI to X) dealt mainly with Aboriginal genealogical records although Volume IX studied the specific subject of convicts and their impact on Western Australian society after the end of convictism in 1868 in more detail. * Volume VI, Aborigines of the Albany region, 1821‚Äì1898 (1989, Neville Green, ) * Volume VII, Aborigines of New Norcia, 1845‚Äì1914 (1989, Neville Green and Lois Tilbrook, ) * Volume VIII, Aborigines of the South West region, 1829‚Äì1840 (1990, Sylvia Hallam and Lois Tilbrook, ) * Volume IX, Convicts in Western Australia 1850‚Äì1887 (1994, Rica Erickson, ) * Volume X, Far From Home ‚Äì Aboriginal Prisoners of Rottnest Island (1999, Neville Green and Susan Moon, ) Notes References See alsoAustralian Dictionary of Biography *Dictionary of Australian Biography *J S Battye Library *Rica Erickson *State Records Office of Western Australia *Western Australia Post Office Directory External links The Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australia, Volumes I-IV, online Western Australian Category:History of Western Australia Category:Books about Western Australia ","title":"Dictionary of Western Australians"},{"id":"5983605","text":"No sos vos, soy yo (international, English title: It's Not You, It's Me) is a 2004 Argentine film directed by Juan Taratuto, starring Diego Peretti, Soledad Villamil and Cecilia Dopazo.

The top two mines show additional fuze wells Cross sectional view of an M15 mine, and an M603 fuze, as well as the appearance of a mine with an M624 tilt-rod fuze installed The M15 mine is a large circular United States anti-tank blast mine, first deployed during the Korean War. Essentially, it is a larger version of the M6A2 anti-tank mine, which it replaced. Although the M15 has been superseded by the M19 mine (a plastic-cased minimum metal mine of more modern design), the U.S. retains large stocks of M15s because they are still regarded as reliable and effective weapons. When used against main battle tanks the M15 is primarily a \\"track-breaker\\" which creates mobility kills, but has a comparatively small likelihood of causing crew fatalities. However, when used against lighter vehicles such as APCs or unarmored vehicles such as trucks the damage inflicted is much more severe. Description The mine consists of a large, circular rounded steel case, with a central pressure plate. In the center of the pressure plate is the M4 arming plug, which has an arming lever which can be set to \\"ARMED\\" or \\"SAFE\\". The pressure plate sits on top of a belleville spring, which in turn rests directly over the M603 fuze. When sufficient downward pressure is applied to the pressure plate (i.e. when a vehicle drives over it) the concertina spring is compressed. This action transfers pressure onto the M603 fuze which fires, triggering detonation. Because this mine has a metallic case, it is very easy to find it using even the most basic mine detector. However, a complicating factor is posed by the two secondary fuze wells. These enable anti-handling devices to be fitted: one on the side of the mine and one underneath. Additionally, a minefield containing M15 mines may also contain a number of minimum metal M19 mines, plus various antipersonnel mines of different types (e.g. the VS-MK2, SB-33, TS-50, PMA-2 or PMA-3), all of which are specifically designed to be difficult to find using metal mine detectors. Typical configuration of anti-handling devices used with M15 mines. The upper diagram shows a pull-fuze screwed into a secondary fuze well in the side of the mine. Additionally, an M5 anti-lift device has been screwed into another fuze well, hidden under the mine. An inexperienced deminer might detect and render safe the pull-fuze, but then be killed when he lifted the mine, triggering the M5 pressure-release firing device underneath. The lower diagram shows two anti-tank landmines connected by a cord attached to the upper mine's carrying handle. The cord is attached to a pull fuze installed in a secondary fuze well in the bottom mine. M15 mines removed from a Cuban minefield being stacked for disposal. Three of them show additional fuze wells on the side Fuzes The M15 mine was originally intended to be fitted with the M600 single-impulse fuze, which contained a glass ampoule of liquid explosive. Unfortunately, the M600 fuze was sensitive to temperature variations and therefore unreliable. For example, freezing temperatures made the mine inert as the liquid froze, whereas temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius could cause the fuze to detonate spontaneously. Just as problematic was the fact that M600 fuzes were inherently unstable, making them dangerous to handle, particularly after having been kept in storage for some time. Because of these shortcomings, the M600 chemical fuze was removed from service around 1953http://bhodian.com/M600fuzejob.html and replaced by the M603 single-impulse fuze, which used a mechanical trigger mechanism i.e. a belleville spring. The M603 fuze is inherently safe to handle and much more reliable. In addition to the standard M603 fuze, two additional fuzes are available: the M624 tilt-rod fuze (which offers full-width attack capability) and the M608 double-impulse fuze. The M624 fuze requires 3.75 pounds of pressure to move the tilt rod, and once it exceeds 20 degrees of tilt the mine will detonate. The M608 double-impulse fuze will not detonate the mine when the first tank drives over it: instead, it simply arms itself so that the mine detonates when the second vehicle (e.g. an APC or perhaps a truck towing a howitzer) following in the tracks of the first tank drives over it ‚Äì an event which might occur seconds, hours or even weeks later. The M608 double-impulse fuze is particularly useful when fitted to mines located on the outer edges of minefields, because this gives tanks a false sense of security. The lead tank, for instance, can drive over 30 mines fitted with double-impulse fuzes without detonating any of them. This lures tanks deep into the minefield, where they eventually trigger mines fitted with the M603 or M624 fuze (both of which operate exclusively in single-impulse mode) and become trapped. Attempts to recover the tanks or rescue victims are hindered by the fact that the M608-fitted mines previously driven over are now operating in single-impulse mode, and also because minefields containing M15 mines usually contain various antipersonnel mines as well, for instance the M14 mine and M16 bounding mine. An additional benefit of double-impulse fuzes is that they give mines a degree of protection against clearance techniques which use blast overpressure or mine roller systems.

It is located on the north side of Yaquina Bay. In 1871‚Äì1874, it was the busiest and most populated of the many coastal ports between Washington and California. History The side of the lighthouse The Yaquina Bay Light was built by Ben Simpson and first lit on November 3, 1871. It was active for only three years due to the establishment of the larger Yaquina Head Light in 1873 that was located just north of the Yaquina Bay Light. So the lighthouse was decommissioned on October 1, 1874, because the newer Yaquina Head Light made it obsolete. The fifth-order Fresnel lens was then installed in the Yerba Buena Light in California for its opening in 1875. The United States Army Corps of Engineers used the lighthouse from 1888 to 1896 as their living quarters while they built the North and South Jetties at the mouth of Yaquina Bay. The United States Coast Guard later used the lighthouse as lookout and living quarters from 1906 to 1915, before moving to their more central quarters which overlooked the busy Newport bayfront. During this period, the Coast Guard also built the eight-story steel observation tower that still stands next to the original lighthouse. In 1934, the Oregon State Highway Division bought the property around the lighthouse to build a new state park. The park site included the lighthouse, the Coast Guard observation tower, and many acres of forested bluff, ocean dunes and surrounding beaches. It is now the Yaquina Bay State Recreation Area and consists of 32 acres of several day- use areas including hiking trails, picnic areas, fishing, and beach access, and has approximately 1,700,000 visitors per year. Some time later in 1946, the lighthouse was scheduled for demolition, which led to the formation of the Lincoln County Historical Society to save it. They raised money for three years to save the dilapidated structure, and got a delay. But by 1951, demolition was again scheduled. Then, Mr. L. E. Warford, who had recently moved to Newport from Ohio, arranged for the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse to be recognized as a historical site supervised by the Historical Society. It served as a county museum for 18 years until 1970. The lighthouse was then listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and restored under the Historic Preservation Act in 1974. At that time, its ownership was transferred to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. The light was re- lit on December 7, 1996, with \\"a modern optic, on loan from lighthouse historian James A. Gibbs.\\" The lighthouse is now a privately maintained navigational aid belonging to the U.S. Coast Guard that displays \\"a fixed white light visible for six miles,\\" and is open for public viewing and tours daily. The Yaquina Bay structure is the only existing lighthouse in the state in which the living quarters are housed in the same building as the light.Combined living and lighthouse quarters existed in Point Adams Light, but was decommissioned in 1899 and demolished in 1912. Only a few with this arrangement were built on the entire Pacific coast. The building is reputed to be haunted.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for Wakefield from 1929 until his accidental death in 1938, representing the Nationalist Party (1929‚Äì1931) and its successor the United Australia Party (1931‚Äì1938). He was Minister for Repatriation and Minister for Markets (later Commerce) in the Lyons government from 1931 to 1932. Early life and war service Hawker was born at Bungaree homestead, near Clare, South Australia. He was the second son of Michael Seymour Hawker, manager of the Hawker family stations, and his wife Elizabeth Begg, n√©e McFarlane, and grandson of George Charles Hawker. Hawker was educated at Geelong Grammar School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, earning Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees in 1919 and 1922, respectively. While studying at Cambridge, he enlisted for service in World War I on 11 August 1914, and was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the 6th (Service) Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry on 1 August 1915. He saw action on the Western Front in the Ypres salient, and was injured on 11 August and again in the Battle of Loos on 25 September, resulting in the loss of his eye. Despite his injuries, Hawker returned to the front with the rank of Captain in May 1917. Hawker was severely wounded again on 4 October 1917 in the Battle of Broodseinde, and was paralysed from the waist down. However, after a series of operations and rehabilitation, he was able to walk with two sticks, although his legs remained in surgical irons for the rest of his life. Hawker returned to South Australia in 1920, resumed his studies and became involved in family agricultural holdings. He became increasingly interested in trade as well as in political movements. Hawker joined the state council of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia in 1921 and served as its vice-president. He was president of the Liberal Federation from 1927 to 1930, and was the South Australian member of the Commonwealth Board of Trade from 1928. Political career In 1929 was elected as a member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the electorate of Wakefield for the United Australia Party. He was appointed Minister for Markets and Minister for Repatriation in first ministry of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons and was the youngest member of the ministry. On 12 April 1932 he was replaced as Minister for Repatriation by Charles Marr and the Markets portfolio was renamed Commerce. On 23 September 1932, he resigned from the ministry in protest at its refusal to reduce parliamentary salaries in response to the Great Depression, having crossed the floor to vote as a minority in a controversial day in Parliament, and did not serve as a minister again, although he continued to represent the people of Wakefield as their elected representative. Hawker travelled extensively, researching issues of trade and farming, and he published his research in pamphlets and treatises and gave lectures on issues of agriculture and pastoral work.Agriculture in Germany and Russia', Border Watch, Saturday 29 February 1936 Death and legacy Hawker died in the Kyeema airplane disaster near Mount Dandenong, Victoria in 1938. A memorial was established at St Michael's Anglican Church at Bungaree. The Australian Electoral Division of Hawker and the Canberra suburb of Hawker, Australian Capital Territory are named in his honour, and the Charles Allan Seymour Hawker Scholarship was established by his sister Kathleen Lilias Needham in 1991 to fund Australian university education. His cousin, David Hawker, was Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 2004 to 2007.

Originally conceived as containing white-spored, thick-gilled agarics (gilled mushrooms), including Hygrophorus and Hygrocybe species (the waxcaps or waxy caps), DNA evidence has extended the limits of the family, so it now contains not only agarics, but also basidiolichens and corticioid fungi. Species are thus diverse and are variously ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, associated with mosses, or saprotrophic. The family contains 25 genera and over 600 species.Lodge et al. (2014), p. 3. None is of any great economic importance, though fruit bodies of some Hygrocybe and Hygrophorus species are considered edible and may be collected for sale in local markets. Taxonomy =History= The family Hygrophoraceae was first proposed by Dutch botanist Johannes Paulus Lotsy (1907) to accommodate agarics with thick, waxy lamellae (gills) and white spores. Lotsy's concept of the family included not only the waxcap-related genera Hygrophorus, Hygrocybe, Camarophyllus (= Hygrophorus), and Godfrinia (= Hygrocybe), but also Gomphidius (despite its blackish spores) and Nyctalis (= Asterophora). Not all subsequent authors accepted the Hygrophoraceae; Carleton Rea (1922), for example, continued to place these genera within a widely defined Agaricaceae. In his major and influential revision of the Agaricales, however, Rolf Singer (1951) did accept the Hygrophoraceae, omitting Gomphidius and Nyctalis, but including Neohygrophorus. Singer's circumscription, with a few later additions, was followed by most authors until the 1990s. Thus the 1995 edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi listed Austroomphaliaster, Bertrandia (=Hygrocybe), Camarophyllopsis, Cuphophyllus, Humidicutis, Hygroaster, Hygrocybe, Hygrophorus, Hygrotrama (= Camarophyllopsis), Neohygrophorus (=Pseudoomphalina), and Pseudohygrocybe (=Hygrocybe) as genera of the Hygrophoraceae. Cornelis Bas (1990), however, did not consider the group distinct, placing the hygrophoroid genera within the Tricholomataceae, a disposition followed by the next (2001) edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi. In contrast, Marcel Bon (1990) believed the Hygrophoraceae were so distinct, he placed the family in its own separate order, the Hygrophorales. =Current status= Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests the Hygrophoraceae are distinct from the Tricholomataceae and are monophyletic (and hence a natural grouping). The genera Camarophyllopsis and Neohygrophorus, however, do not belong within the family, but several other agaric and non-agaric genera do. The agaric genera include Ampulloclitocybe, Cantharellula, and Lichenomphalia, as well as the partly agaric, partly cyphelloid genus Arrhenia. The non-agaric genera include the corticioid Eonema (formerly placed in Athelia) and Cyphellostereum, as well as the shelf-like basidiolichen genera Acantholichen, Cora, Corella and Dictyonema. As a result, the Hygrophoraceae as currently understood have no known morphological features in common that define them (synapomorphy). Habitat, nutrition, and distribution The majority of species in the Hygrophoraceae are ground-dwelling, though a few (such as Chrysomphalina species) occur on wood, or on mosses (Arrhenia species), or herbaceous stems (Eonema pyriforme). Most are found in woodland, though (in Europe at least) Hygrocybe species are typical of waxcap grasslands. Species are nutritionally diverse. Hygrophorus species are ectomycorrhizal, typically forming associations with the roots of living trees. Hygrocybe species are now believed to be moss associates, as are some or all species of Arrhenia and Cantharellula. Three genera, Acantholichen, Dictyonema, and Lichenomphalina, are basidiolichens, forming associations with algae and cyanobacteria. A few genera, such as Ampulloclitocybe and Eonema, may be saprotrophic. Members of the Hygrophoraceae are distributed worldwide, from the tropics to the subpolar regions. Over 400 species have been described to date. Economic usage Fruit bodies of some Hygrophorus and Hygrocybe species are edible and widely collected, sometimes being offered for sale in local markets. Examples of wild mushrooms collected and sold include Hygrophorus russula, H. purpurascens, H. chrysodon, and H. hypothejus in Mexico,Dugan (2011), pp. 76‚Äì78. and H. eburneus and H. latitabundus in the Spanish Pyrenees.Dugan (2011), p. 44.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from northern America. It has long bright green leaves, very tall stems, 1‚Äì2 musky fragrant flowers, in a range of blue shades, from pale blue, to lavender blue, to bright blue, to dark blue, and to violet blue. Rarely, there is a white form. Description Iris giganticaerulea (like its common name the 'Giant blue iris') is the largest species of the Louisiana Irises. It has very large green rhizomes, which are between 5 and 12 inches (13 ‚Äì 30 cm) long and 0.75 to 1.5 inches (2‚Äì4 cm) thick. They are shallow rooted, marked with the scars (of the previous seasons) leaves, with many branches, which can form a large clump/colony growing up to 6 x 3 feet (182 x 91 cm). It has rising from the base of the plant, 4‚Äì6 bright green leaves, ensiform (sword- shaped) and measuring between 20 ‚Äì 30 inches (50‚Äì76 cm) long and 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) wide. It has very tall stems, that can grow between to between 28 ‚Äì 71 inches (70‚Äì180 cm) tall. They can have 2‚Äì3 branches, with 1‚Äì2 terminal flowers, arising above the leaves. There can be up to 12 flowers on the plant. It blooms between during early to mid spring, generally between March and April (both in the UK and America), with fragrant flowers which have a musky scent. It comes in a range of blue shades, from pale blue, to lavender blue, to bright blue, to dark blue, and to violet blue. Occasionally there is a white form, or yellowish white. The flowers are generally 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) across. It has 6 petals, 3 outer sepals (called the falls), which are flaring (1.75 inch or 4 cm wide), arch downwards and have a white or yellow or faint orange signal patch or ridge. It also has 3 inner sepals (called the standards), which are slightly erect or upright and narrower than the falls. It has a 4‚Äì5 cm long perianth tube, blue-violet style 1.3‚Äì1.5 inch (3.5‚Äì4 cm long) and 2 lobed stigmas. After flowering, it has bright green ellipsoid capsules 3‚Äì4 inches (7‚Äì10 cm) long by 1 inch (3 cm) wide, which are hexagonal in cross section and shaped like a D. =Genetics= As most irises are diploid, they have two sets of chromosomes. This fact can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count of 2n=44. It has been counted several times 2n=44, Randolph 1934 (ex Randolph & Mitra in Bulletin of the American Iris Society 140, in 1956) 2n=44 Riley 1942, 2n=42, R C Foster 1937 (as Iris hexagona var. giganticaerulea) and 2n=44, Randolph, 1966. Taxonomy It has the common name of Giant blue iris, or Giant blue flag. Note, the blue flag is normally Iris virginica. It was first published and described by Small (of the New York Botanical Garden,) in 'Addisonia' in 1929. In 1937, Foster thought that it was a variety of Iris hexagona and renamed it 'Iris hexagona var. giganticaerulea'. In 1966, Randolph re-assessed it and classified it as a separate species. Between 1950 and 1990, a large and fractious argument was waged over the state flower of Louisiana. Eventually, in 1990 a compromise was reached,Mary A.Hood the Southern magnolia would be the state flower and Iris giganticaerulea was declared as the official state wildflower of Louisiana in 1990. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, and then updated on 2 December 2004. Distribution and habitat It is native to northern America. =Range= Iris giganticaerulea is native to Alabama, Louisiana, (on the west edge of Mississippi River), eastern Texas, and Mississippi in the United States. This constricted range is due to limited hardiness of the species. It grows in shallow freshwater, within roadside ditches, clearings within swamps (including cypress swamps,), wet meadows and marshes. It is tolerant of brackish water. Cultivation left The Louisiana irises generally all have similar cultivation requirements, with minor differences. They need full sunlight or partial shade, moist, acidic soils (ph level of 6.5) with a high organic and high fertility content (or humus rich).Helen Nash For best flowering, moisture is essential during late autumn, winter and spring times (between October to May), when the plant starts to grow new leaves.Neil G. Odenwald and James R. Turner They can be given a light feed between autumn and spring, if needed. Propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes.Nick Romanowski Which is best carried out in early autumn or early spring, when the plants are dormant. The ground must be prepared pre-planting, with the addition of a generous amount of organic matter and the soils dug to about 6 inches deep (to allow for new root growth). Plants require dividing every 3‚Äì4 years to promote good flowering. They can combine with other plants but tend to 'move' to suitable positions. If using a fertilizer, sprinkle around the plant in late January or February, before the plant is in flower. New plantings need to be mulched to prevent sun-scalding. It is also recommended to be added to during winter. The iris seed is not hard to raise but a very slow process. It can take many months to germinate (between 3‚Äì12 months) with a 50% germination average. They then can take 3‚Äì5 years before reaching flowering stage. Seeds should be harvested from the plant after flowering but they must be from mature seed pods. They then should be stored in paper bags, as seed stored in glass containers often goes mouldy. Iris giganticaerulea and Iris hexagona are considered too tender for cultivation in the UK. Since it needs moist acid soils, with warm summers and milder winters. It is hardy to USDA Zone 7 to 11 (or 5 and 6 if protected during the winter). It is often available at water garden centres.

Others also contributed towards the completion of the blue print and furnishing of Istana Maziah, including Engku Besar Paduka Raja Sayyid Abdullah bin Zin Al-Idrus, Muhammad bin Abdul Rahim (Encik Mat) and Dato‚Äô Mata-Mata. Wood supply to build the Istana came from the region of Dungun and this responsibility of obtaining it was entrusted to Tengku Panglima Besar Tengku Muda Kechik, while bricks and chalk were handled by Tengku Besar Paduka Indera. Because of the constant lack of funds, the palace construction was delayed many times.

Architecture The palace stands at a height of 2 storeys and is noticeably coffee brown in colour. It is a blend of modern and traditional architecture with its tall shuttered windows that resembles a French chateau. About 20 Malay and Chinese workers who were skilled in art, wood craft and carpentry were involved in the building of Istana Maziah.

Early life Melville was born in Tokatoka, on the Wairoa River south of Dargaville. Her father was a farmer and boatbuilder, while her mother was a former teacher. After receiving a basic education from her mother and in Tokatoka, she won a scholarship to study at what is now Auckland Girls' Grammar School (then part of Auckland Grammar School). She began to study to become a lawyer, then an unusual choice for women  when she was admitted to the bar in 1906, she was only the second woman in New Zealand to reach this stage (the first being Ethel Benjamin). Melville established her own legal practice, and practised on her own account for 37 years. Political career Melville was highly active in promoting women's causes, and in encouraging full participation by women in public life. Much of her activity centred on women's associations and committees, and she held a number of senior positions in such organisations. She was a strong advocate of women seeking political office. In 1913 she became the first woman to be elected to a municipal authority in New Zealand, gaining a seat on the Auckland City Council which she held for 33 consecutive years to 1946. Politically, Melville tended to be conservative in issues not relating to women's rights. Melville was active in the campaign that led to the Women's Parliamentary Rights Act, allowing women to stand for Parliament (women had already been able to vote for some time). In the 1919 general election, Melville was a candidate for the Reform Party in the electorate of Grey Lynn, where she placed second. In the 1922 general election, however, she was not selected as a candidate, allegedly being blocked by political organiser Albert Davy. Melville believed that she had been blocked due to the Reform Party not wanting a woman as a candidate, and she stood as an independent candidate in Roskill. In a 1926 by-election, she stood as an independent in Eden, splitting the Reform Party's vote and helping Rex Mason, the Labour Party candidate, to win the seat. She subsequently stood in the 1928 general election, the 1931 general election, a 1941 by-election, and the 1943 election, generally performing well but never winning. She was one of six candidates who stood for selection for the electorate by the National Party for the , but Harry Merritt was chosen instead. In 1935, Melville was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Melville died on 27 July 1946 in Remuera. She never married, and had no children. Melville Park in Epsom is named after her. The Ellen Melville Centre in central Auckland is also named after her.

John Furphy (17 June 184223 September 1920) was an Australian blacksmith credited with inventing the \\"furphy\\", a water cart that was used by the Australian army during the first World War. Early life Furphy was born on 17 June 1842 in Moonee Ponds, Victoria, the eldest son of farmer Samuel Furphy and dressmaker Judith (n√©e Hare), both of whom were Irish immigrants. Initially home-schooled, Furphy later attended public schools in Kangaroo Ground and Kyneton. Career Furphy first found employment at the Kyneton-based farm machinery manufacturer Hutcheson & Walker, before becoming an independent blacksmith in 1864. Moving to nearby Shepparton in 1873, he established the first blacksmith's shop in the township, gradually expanding into iron works. By 1888, Furphy had the most extensive foundry in northern Victoria. His patented grain stripper, which preceded the combine harvester was awarded the first prize at the 1884 Grand National Show. His agricultural machinery, including a grain stripper, a furrow plough and iron swingletrees, were likewise acclaimed at the International Exhibition from 1888 to 1889. Furphy's most recognised agricultural product was the \\"Furphy Farm Water Cart\\", a water cart with a cylindrical tank made of iron, placed in a wooden frame on cast-iron wheels and horizontally mounted to be harnessed by a horse. Annual production of the water carts averaged 300 per year and peaked during World War I when used in large numbers by the Australian Army. The term \\"Furphy\\" also became slang for gossip, as many Furphy water cart drivers were supposedly gossips. Personal life and death Furphy was a devout Christian who offered lay-preaching to Methodist congregations at Tullygaroopna, Shepparton and the surrounding district. To the list of foundry products inscribed on the cast-iron back plates of his water carts, Furphy added a temperance message in shorthand. He married Sarah Ann (n√©e Vaughan) on 25 May 1866. They had nine children. His brother Joseph Furphy became known as one of Australia's pioneer novelists. Furphy spent his final years in Melbourne, where he had relocated to in 1909. He died on 23 September 1920. The Furphy Foundry is still operated by his descendants.

Private Guyton was from the small town of Evart, Michigan. Life Guyton was born in Evart Township, Michigan. He attended a rural school in the area for only a short time before leaving to work in the oil fields of Ohio. He also worked as a farmer, plumber and well driller. In December 1909, Joseph Guyton married Winona Baker (died 1918) from Lake City, Michigan. Their only child, Olive Clara Guyton, was born in 1911 and died in 1922. In 1917, after the U.S. entered World War I, Guyton joined the 126th Infantry Regiment and was attached to the 32nd Infantry Division (the \\"Red Arrow Division\\") at Camp MacArthur near Waco, Texas. On February 17, 1918, Private Guyton sailed with his comrades out of New York harbor bound for France. On May 15, 1918, the status of his unit was changed from replacement division to combat. Death At around midnight on May 24, Guyton became the first casualty. He was an automatic gunner on a post near the line of resistance. His instructions were to fire his gun intermittently. He was discharging his duties when the Germans returned a barrage of machine gun fire; Guyton was struck in the temple and died instantly. The Commanding General of the 9th French Infantry Division, to which the 126th was attached, issued the following orders on the 25 May: > Divisional Order No. 297 General Gamelin, commanding the 9th Infantry > Division, cites in the Divisional Order: \\"The soldier, Joseph W.

He was temporarily buried in a nearby church yard on foreign soil. He was posthumously awarded the croix de guerre (the grand cross of honor) by the government of France. In memory Gravesite of Joseph W. Guyton in Evart, MI In May 1921, President Warren G. Harding placed a presidential wreath on the flag-draped coffin of Private Guyton at a funeral ceremony for over 5,000 American war-dead at the army piers, Hoboken, New Jersey. He spoke these words: \\"In the name of the republic, I bestow this tribute on the casket of the first soldier who perished on the soil of the enemy... I chose it because I am offering the tribute to the one returned whose death on enemy soil marked the day when our civilization went face forward and the assault on our present day civilization knew it had failed. May 24, 1918, is the date on which this soldier was killed, and the name is that of Joseph W. Guyton, Company I of the 126th Infantry, a resident patriot and hero of the State of Michigan of the United States of America.\\" Guyton's remains were returned from New Jersey to Evart by rail and were met at the depot by his parents, relatives, friends, citizens of the town, and members of the Joseph W. Guyton Post of the American Legion named in his honor. June 5, 1921, 10,000 people gathered in Evart to pay tribute to the hero. On hand were dignitaries of the military, state government, local government, and a number of Civil War veterans. The local Evart newspaper reported that over 1,000 automobiles and 500 soldiers were present in the small community that day. Guyton's remains were buried at Forest Hill cemetery outside the town. The following week, Olive Guyton (aged 10) presented the American flag that had draped Guyton's casket, to the local American Legion Post. Olive made the presentation with the assistance of her uncle, L.V. Guyton of Lancaster, Ohio, as her mother had died from influenza just months after her husband was killed. Olive died just one year later from pneumonia. Legacy Within the city of Evart today are a park and highway bridge both dedicated to the memory of Joseph W. Guyton. In Guyton Park stands a cannon dating back to World War I and a monument to the memory of all who lost their lives from Evart during World War I, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Memorial Day ceremonies begin at the Guyton Park and conclude at Forest Hill Cemetery. An elementary school on the East Side of Detroit, Michigan was built and named in honor of Joseph Guyton.

The station was closed in 1958, but was used by contractors demolishing the line in the 1960s to bring equipment in and out. History Despite its name the site of West Hoathly station is actually situated in the village of Sharpthorne, half a mile from the village West Hoathly. The station opened in 1882, just north of the long Sharpthorne Tunnel. Along with other stations along the line, all constructed under the influence of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;), a then substantial provision of ¬£17,000 was made to construct each two-platform through station (the architecture was similar to that now seen at the restored ). These stations were designed to visually appeal to Victorian London-commuters, who had travelled into the Sussex countryside looking for either a commuter property, or country cottage for the weekend. Designed in the then fashionable \\"Domestic Revival\\" style (similar to the later Tudor Revival architecture style), located on the westwards facing No.1 upside platform, the lavish main station building was designed as a two-storey villa with a T-shaped footprint, with a single storey wing each side: booking office and toilets to the north; waiting room and storage to the south. All of this structure was fronted both sides by a timber-supported hipped canopy, which like all of the other buildings carried a hipped slate roof. The station had substantial sidings and a livestock loading dock located just to the north of No.1 platform. The downside No.2 platform was connected to the main buildings by a glazed footbridge, and had a similar timber-supported canopy which fronted a wooden waiting room. The signal box was located on the north end of No.2 platform, and also controlled a single siding to the north of platform No.2. The station layout remained substantially unaltered throughout its operational life. However, it was found after a few years usage that the original external finish to the main station building of timber beams and plaster infill was prone to water ingress, and so in the early 1900s was reformed in the local architectural style by covering the external walls with vertically-hung clay tiles. In the 1930s, the Southern Railway removed many of the superfluous LB&SCR; decorations, and shortened the downside facilities to what was basically an open-plan shelter located next to the footbridge. Commercially on the station site, there was a small brickworks built to the east on land leased from the railway, giving it direct rail access; Today the still open brickworks is operated by Ibstock Brick Ltd, producing traditional Stock Bricks. A railway-built and owned \\"Railway Hotel\\" opened on the west side of the station forecourt, opposite the main station building. After closure of the railway, it was sold off by the British Railways Property Board and renamed the \\"Bluebell Inn\\", reopened as a public house. Closed in 1999, it is now a private residence called \\"Bluebell House\\". Closure and demolition The station closed to passengers on 30 May 1955, with the goods yard closed on 13 June. After legal objections to the line's closure, the station reopened to passengers on 7 August 1956, closing permanently on 17 March 1958. After the closure of the line to all traffic in 1963, the assigned BR contractors took over the site, using its facilities to control removal of track and infrastructure from the entire railway, and using its excellent road access to redistribute the assets. To enable their works, the contractors removed the down-side buildings and footbridge in 1964, and lifted the tracks in 1964/5. The main station building was demolished in late 1967. Preservation With a truncated line operating between Sheffield Park and Horsted Keynes, the Bluebell Railway Society purchased the largely levelled and cleared site in 1974. After raising funds to extend the line northwards, the Society was faced with much local opposition to the extension, resulting in a public enquiry and resultant planning application. Following approval of the decision by both the Secretary of State for the Environment and Secretary of State for Transport, in 1985, the Society was granted the planning permission for the preserved railways extension to East Grinstead, and the right to apply for a Light Railway Order, with the stipulation that West Hoathly would not be redeveloped as a station, due to local residents' concerns about a likely increase in local road traffic. If the Society were later to decide to undertake such a station redevelopment, it would need to apply for additional planning permission. In 1992, the Society's extension reached New Coombe Bridge, where a simple run-around loop was provided on the alignment of the former up line through West Hoathly, located just north of the former No.2 platform. Since then, the Society - much like the 1960s railway removal contractors - have used the site to store materials for the extension, which were delivered there by road. This allowed the rebuilding of New Coombe Bridge, and opening of the extension northwards to Kingscote in early 1994. With the installation of a run-around loop at Kingscote railway station, the loop just north of West Hoathly was removed, and the line returned to its current single-track, non-stopping configuration. As part of the extension of the line north from Kingscote, the Society needed to contribute ¬£4 million to the cost of removing rubbish from the former Imberhorne landfill site, which had filled in a cutting to a depth of . To help meet the cost, Society members agreed to the sale of two plots of land on a former brickworks site to the east of the former station.

The Society believes that in the long term, with substantial residential complexes around the former station site, the station could provide a useful public-transport facility for the residents of West Hoathly and Sharpthorne. West Hoathly Parish Council currently supports the provision of a halt at the site. However, under current Railway Inspectorate guidelines, it would not be possible to build what would now be considered a \\"new\\" station on the former site, as it is located on a gradient. Hence the Society believes that any future station at West Hoathly would most likely be located on the level stretch from the end of the Goods yard towards New Coombe Bridge, approximately where the former temporary run-around loop was located.

It was directed by Wilfred Jackson. It is a sequel to the 1935 short The Tortoise and the Hare, and premiered on August 22, 1936. This time the plot revolves around a boxing match. The short features characters from other Silly Symphonies, including Elmer Elephant and Tillie Tiger from Elmer Elephant, Fifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf from Three Little Pigs, and Jenny Wren and the cuckoo from Who Killed Cock Robin?. It was released in VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD formats in various countries. Plot Max Hare is boxing Toby Tortoise, and beating him severely in round one. Between rounds, Jenny Wren from Who Killed Cock Robin? tells Toby she \\"likes a man who takes his time\\", which seems to reinvigorate him. Come round two, Max deals out what should be the finishing blow, but Toby pulls into his shell to avoid the fists. Feeling robbed, Max demands that Toby come out and face him, but Toby says he feels safer in his shell. Max tries to make him come out by dumping a bucket of water in Toby's shell, but Toby pops out wearing a diving helmet, then ducks back into his shell. At the end of his patience, Max fills his shell with fireworks to draw out Toby. This backfires, however, as Toby begins unintentionally shooting fireworks in Max's direction. One firework sends Max flying out of the arena with the paramedics who were waiting to take Toby to the hospital. Once the fireworks stop, Toby is declared the winner.

Forrest was born near Yandilla, Queensland (now part of Toowoomba Region), the daughter of James Checkley Mills and his wife Margaret Nelson, n√©e Haxell. She began writing at an early age but did not publish her first book, The Rose of Forgiveness and other Stories, until 1904. She became well known as a writer of verse following the publication of her first volume of poems, Alpha Centauri, which appeared in Melbourne in 1909. Her first novel A Bachelor's Wife, was included in the Bookstall series in 1914. The Green Harper (prose and verse) followed in 1915, and Streets and Gardens, a small collection of verse, in 1922. In 1924 The Wild Moth, a novel, was published in London, and was followed by four other novels, Gaming Gods (1926), Hibiscus Heart (1927), Reaping Roses (1928), and White Witches (1929). Poems by M. Forrest, a collection of her verse contributions to Australian, English and American magazines, was published at Sydney in 1927. In addition to her work in book form, for the last 30 years of her life Forrest poured out a constant stream of verse and short stories for newspapers and magazines. Probably no other woman in Australia ever maintained herself so long by freelance journalism. Her verse is represented in several anthologies. Her novels were perhaps little more than stories written to fulfil the demands of the circulating libraries, but Forrest was an admirable journalist who lived a life that had many misfortunes with great industry, ability and courage. Forrest died of pneumonia on 18 March 1935 in Brisbane, after a long illness. She was twice married and was survived by a daughter. Gaming Gods was dedicated to the memory of her second husband, John Forrest.

Called \\"woodwaxes\\" in the UK or \\"waxy caps\\" (together with Hygrocybe species) in North America, basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are typically fleshy, often with slimy caps and lamellae that are broadly attached to decurrent. All species are ground-dwelling and ectomycorrhizal (forming an association with living trees) and are typically found in woodland. Around 100 species are recognized worldwide. Fruit bodies of several species are considered edible and are sometimes offered for sale in local markets. Taxonomy =History= Hygrophorus was first published in 1836 by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. The generic name is derived from the Greek ·ø¶Œ≥œÅ·ΩÅœÇ (= moist) + œÜœåœÅŒøœÇ (= bearer), with reference to the slimy caps found in many species. Fries (1849) subsequently split the genus into three subgenera: Limacium, Camarophyllus, and Hygrocybe. The last of these is now recognized as a genus in its own right, but was frequently included within Hygrophorus until the 1970s. Camarophyllus (type species Hygrophorus camarophyllus) and Limacium were also raised to the rank of genus, but are regarded as synonyms of Hygrophorus. Camarophyllus sensu Singer (based on Hygrocybe pratensis) is, however, a synonym of Hygrocybe (or Cuphophyllus). =Current status= Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that Hygrophorus (minus Hygrocybe) is a monophyletic (and hence natural) genus. Only a few species, however, have been sequenced to date. Description Fruit bodies of Hygrophorus species are all agaricoid, most (but not all) having smooth caps that are viscid to glutinous when damp. The lamellae beneath the cap are usually distant, thick, waxy, and broadly attached to decurrent. The stems of Hygrophorus species often have traces of a glutinous veil, sometimes forming an equally glutinous ring or ring-zone. The spore print is white. Microscopically, Hygrocybe species lack true cystidia and have smooth, inamyloid basidiospores. Habitat and distribution Species of Hygrophorus are ectomycorrhizal, most forming associations with trees (both broadleaf and conifer) and hence typically found in woodlands. Many appear to be host specific, Hygrophorus cossus, for example, occurring with oak and H. speciosus with larch. Species are distributed worldwide, from the tropics to the sub-polar regions. Around 100 have been described to date. As food Fruit bodies of a few species are considered edible and are collected and consumed locally (sometimes sold in markets) in Spain and eastern Europe, China and Bhutan, and Central America . Literature No comprehensive monograph of the genus has yet been published. In Europe, however, species of Hygrophorus have been illustrated and described in an Italian guide by Candusso (1997). European species have also been covered, more briefly, in descriptive French keys by Bon (1990). Dutch species were illustrated and described by Arnolds (1990). No equivalent modern guides have been published for North America, the most recent being by Hesler & Smith (1963). There is, however, a guide to Californian species by Largent (1985). In Australia, Hygrophorus species have been illustrated and described by Young (2005) and in New Zealand by Horak (1990).

Called waxcaps in English (sometimes waxy caps in North America), basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are often brightly coloured and have waxy to slimy caps, white spores, and smooth, ringless stems. In Europe they are characteristic of old, unimproved grasslands (termed waxcap grasslands) which are a declining habitat, making many Hygrocybe species of conservation concern. Elsewhere they are more typically found in woodlands. Most are ground-dwelling and all are believed to be moss associates. Around 150 species are recognized worldwide. Fruit bodies of several Hygrocybe species are considered edible and are sometimes offered for sale in local markets. Taxonomy =History= Hygrocybe was first published in 1821 by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as a subsection of Agaricus and in 1871 was raised to the rank of genus by Kummer. In several papers, Karsten and Murrill used the name Hydrocybe, but this is now taken as an orthographic variant of Hygrocybe. The generic name is derived from the Greek ·ø¶Œ≥œÅ·ΩÅœÇ (= moist) + Œ∫œÖŒ≤Œ∑ (= head). Despite its comparatively early publication, the genus Hygrocybe was not widely accepted until the 1970s, most previous authors treating it as a synonym of Hygrophorus, a related genus of ectomycorrhizal agarics. Hygrocybe itself has been split into subgenera, several of which ‚Äì notably Cuphophyllus (= Camarophyllus sensu Singer, non Fries) and Gliophorus Herink ‚Äì have subsequently been raised to generic rank. Some species, such as the mauve splitting waxcap (Humidicutis lewelliniae), have been described in the small genus Humidicutis. =Current status= Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that Hygrocybe as currently understood is paraphyletic and does not form a single clade within the Hygrophoraceae. As a result, the genus Cuphophyllus (comprising Hygrocybe pratensis and its allies) was removed from Hygrocybe sensu stricto, together with the genus Gliophorus (comprising Hygrocybe psittacina and its allies) and several other genera. Description Fruit bodies of Hygrocybe species are all agaricoid, most (but not all) having smooth to slightly scaly caps that are convex to conical and waxy to slimy when damp. Many (but not all) are brightly coloured in shades of red, orange, or yellow ‚Äì less commonly pink or green. Where present, the gills beneath the cap are often equally coloured and usually distant, thick, and waxy. One atypical South American species, Hygrocybe aphylla, lacks gills. The stems of Hygrocybe species lack a ring. The spore print is white. Fruit bodies of some species, notably Hygrocybe conica, blacken with age or when bruised. Microscopically, Hygrocybe species lack true cystidia and have comparatively large, smooth, inamyloid basidiospores. Habitat, nutrition, and distribution Most species of Hygrocybe are soil-dwelling, though a few (such as Hygrocybe mexicana and H. rosea) are only known from mossy tree trunks or logs. In Europe, species are typical of unimproved (nutrient-poor), short-sward grasslands, often termed \\"waxcap grasslands\\", but elsewhere they are more commonly found in woodland. Their metabolism has long been debated, but recent research suggests that they are not saprotrophic but rather symbiotically associated the roots of higher plants or mosses. Hyphae of H. conica have been detected in plant roots and other waxcap species have been detected as systemic endophytes of Plantago lanceolata. Species are distributed worldwide, from the tropics to the sub- polar regions. Around 150 have been described to date. Waxcaps receive most attention in northern Europe, where they are found in nutrient-poor pastures. However, outside Europe, waxcaps are more commonly associated with woodland habitats, for example the sclerophyll forests site at Lane Cove Bushland Park and Ferndale Park, Sydney. Conservation In Europe, waxcap grasslands and their associated fungi are of conservation concern, since unimproved grasslands (formerly commonplace) have declined dramatically as a result of changes in agricultural practice. As a result, by 1993, 89% of European Hygrocybe species appeared on one or more national red lists of threatened fungi. In several countries, action has been taken to conserve waxcap grasslands and some of the rarer Hygrocybe species. Guidance In the United Kingdom, some grasslands have gained a measure of legal protection as Sites of Special Scientific Interest because of their waxcap interest, notably Llanishen Reservoir in Cardiff, where the original SSSI notification by the Countryside Council for Wales in 2006 was upheld following judicial review. Economic usage Because Hygrocybe species cannot be maintained in culture, none is cultivated commercially. Fruit bodies of a few species are considered edible in eastern Europe, south-east Asia, and Central America and are collected and consumed locally. Literature No comprehensive monograph of the genus has yet been published. In Europe, however, species of Hygrocybe have been illustrated and described in a standard English-language guide by Boertmann (2010) and also (together with Hygrophorus) in an Italian guide by Candusso (1997). European species have also been covered, more briefly, in descriptive French keys by Bon (1990). Dutch species were illustrated and described by Arnolds (1990).

Between 1932 and 1939 Walker was married to D'Oyly Carte chorister Ena Martin. He married the company's principal soprano Helen Roberts in 1944. After serving in the Coldstream Guards, Walker began his career in touring in concerts and revues. He joined D'Oyly Carte at age 27 and remained with the company for 25 years. At first playing mostly smaller roles and understudying larger ones, by 1942 Walker had been promoted as a principal baritone of the company, playing roles like Pooh Bah in The Mikado. His total of thirty-five Savoy Opera roles is the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's all-time record. After leaving the company, Walker and Roberts were engaged in Australia by J. C. Williamson to Australia and New Zealand throughout the 1950s and early 1960s in Gilbert and Sullivan as well as other works in their repertory. He also stage directed. In the early 1970s, they toured for more than four years in the original Australian production of My Fair Lady and presented Gilbert and Sullivan in two-person entertainments throughout the United States and Canada.

Walker was doing concert work and had returned from a production of The Gondoliers in Limerick, Ireland, in 1949, when D'Oyly Carte asked him to step in as an emergency replacement, initially filling in as Grosvenor in Patience (Prestige wrote that his \\"interpretation ... can only be described as magnificent\\") and then Bouncer, Counsel, Bobstay, Pish-Tush, the Lieutenant, and Giuseppe in The Gondoliers for the remainder of the season.Rollins and Witts, p. 173 His total of 35 Savoy Opera roles while a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company is the company's all-time record.Prestige, Colin. \\"Old Favourites: Richard Walker and Helen Roberts\\", The Savoyard, Vol. X No. 1, May 1971, pp. 26‚Äì27Rollins and Witts, passim =Australia and touring= After his last season with D'Oyly Carte, Walker and Roberts were engaged by the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and toured Australia and New Zealand throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. When the Williamsons played Gilbert and Sullivan, as they did for extended tours every five or six years, Walker sang his familiar roles, as well as Dick Deadeye in Pinafore and Sergeant Meryll in Yeomen, and he directed the operas. Walker and Roberts also performed in musical comedies in Australia under other management. From 1959, they toured for more than four years in the original Australian production of My Fair Lady, Walker as Alfred P. Doolittle and Roberts as Mrs. Eynsford-Hill. They then settled in Sydney. Walker later appeared in the Williamson production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In 1967, he joined the Elizabethan Theatre Company, playing Frosch in Die Fledermaus. Walker also presented Gilbert and Sullivan with Roberts in two-person entertainments throughout the United States and Canada beginning in the 1950s. President Eisenhower asked them to give their concert programme at his pre- inauguration party at the White House following his re-election in 1956, but they were unable to attend, as they were then in Australia. Walker was the Honorary President of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York from 1951 until his death.\\"Helen Betty Roberts Walker 1912‚Äì2010\\", The Palace Peeper, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, Vol. LXXV, No. 5, p. 2, January 2011 Walker died in Sydney, Australia, at the age of 91.

Members of Camarophyllopsis are distinguished from members of the family Hygrophoraceae mainly by their hymenoderm pileipellis. The arrangement of lamellar trama is highly variable between species. Coloration of the fruit body is dull, tending toward browns and grays. Many members of this genus were formerly classified in the genus Hygrotrama, but the two genera were subsequently put in synonymy. Taxonomy Camarophyllopsis was circumscribed by Czech mycologist Josef Herink in 1958, with Hygrophorus schulzeri as the type and only species. Roger Heim had the year previously treated this group of species under the name Hodophilus, but this was invalid because he did not include a Latin diagnosis for the genus, as was required by the rules of botanical nomenclature at the time. Rolf Singer published Hygrotrama in March 1959 (with type species Hygrotrama dennisianum), and Heim later (1966) published the name Hodophilus validly (type species H. foetens). Since Camarophyllopsis was published earlier than either of these competing names, it has priority. Eef Arnolds proposed an infrageneric classification of Camarophyllopsis consisting of two subgenera differentiated by the structure of the cap cuticle (pileipellis). Subgenus Camarophyllis contained species with a trichodermium pileipellis (with hyphae arranged perpendicularly to the cap surface), while species in subgenus Hygrotrama had a hymeniderm pileipellis (with a structure similar to that of the hymenium). Arnolds further split the latter subgenus into two sections: sect. Hygrotrama (with clamp connections), and sect. Hodophilus (without clamp connections). Previously placed in the family Hygrophoraceae based on its morphology, Camarophyllopsis was shown using molecular phylogenetics to belong in the Clavariaceae.

History The Marpole road bridge was a nearby sequence of separate structures dating from 1889. =Early CP operation= Once the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway, controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), completed the rail bridge in May 1902, work trains carried the steel rails over the river to lay track on Lulu Island. The route proceeded due south from the bridge along today's Garden City Rd. and west along Granville Ave., before south on Railway Ave. The steel swing span railway bridge linked north Eburne with Richmond, and the then important community, port and canneries at Steveston. Created primarily to serve the canneries, the line was not the anticipated commercial success, because the companies preferred shipping directly by sea. Using steam locomotives, the twice daily Vancouver‚ÄìSteveston mixed trains began that year, but the CP enthusiasm for electrification indicated a desire to off-load the service. =BCER operation= In 1905, the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) leased and electrified the line, as it later would with a new branch to New Westminster. The respective interurbans operated Vancouver‚ÄìMarpole (formerly Eburne) (1905‚Äì52), Marpole‚ÄìSteveston (1905‚Äì58), and Marpole‚ÄìNew Westminster (1909‚Äì56). During the early years, the Steveston tram ran hourly. Freight largely comprised smaller loads of way freight. By 1921, spurs to several customers existed near the northern and southern bridge approaches. Owing to the proximity of several bridges on the Fraser, the unique signal for opening the then called British Columbia Electric Bridge on the North Arm, was four long and two short blasts on the vessel's horn. By the end of passenger service in 1958, freight comprised boxcar loads, such as fish oil, often hauled by electric locomotives, soon to become an all diesel fleet on the removal of the overhead power wire. BC Hydro, the successor (1962) to BCER, changed the route in 1965. At the southern bridge approach, the freight track now paralleled the Fraser westward, at a distance of up to from the shoreline, before continuing south to join at the Granville/Railway junction. This catered to the Brighouse Industrial Estate, and the Van Horne Industrial Estate surrounding the foot of the bridge. That year, bridge maintenance comprised the renewal of four protection piers and work on the southern approach trestle. In 1967, when a barge carrying wood chips struck a steel support, the swing span collapsed into the river. Abandoned, the original north Richmond route was sold to the municipality. Any remaining track was buried on the raising of arterial roads for flood protection. In decline for decades, Steveston freight handling ceased in the 1970s, which effectively ended all traffic to points west of No. 2 Rd. In 1986, BCER relinquished its lease on the track. =Later CP operation= In 1992, the railway crossing was lifted during the No. 2 Road Bridge construction. By this time, apart from those No. 2 Rd‚ÄìSteveston sections already sold, such as the Lynas Lane city works yard, the remaining track was largely overgrown with dense bramble and high birch. A few years later, this track was lifted. Northeastward, CP Rail Bridge in foreground, Oak St. Bridge in background By 2002, the only active spur south of Cambie Rd. was Canadian Firelog beside No. 2 Rd., but Ebco Industries (7851 Alderbridge Way) experienced limited use. By 2007, the two major customer spurs were Univar (River Dr./Van Horne Way), and Fraser River Terminals (opposite on River Dr.). Columbia Foam (9500 Van Horne Way) received infrequent service. In 2006, the city purchased the No. 2 Rd‚ÄìCapstan Way section, allowing CP use to Gilbert Rd. until 2010, but immediately ended service to Canadian Firelog. In realigning River Rd. and developing the Richmond Olympic Oval site, the track southwest of Hollybridge Way was lifted. That year, the Canada Line Operations and Maintenance Centre site was prepared. This involved the demolition of several warehouses, and the rerouting of CP tracks between the southern approaches for the CP Rail and North Arm SkyTrain bridges. In 2010, the city purchased the Railway Ave. stretch, which opened exclusively as a greenway in 2013, quashing any prospects of restoring light rail. In 2014, the track southwest of the bridge, unused at least since 2010, was lifted along the long curve passing beneath the Canada Line, and for the remainder southwest of the Richmond Marina. That year, a hot and fast fire, possibly started by vandals, destroyed a section of the creosote-treated wooden trestle approach on the Marpole side. The thick smoke temporarily closed the Oak Street Bridge, and impacted Vancouver International Airport flights. In failing to repair the structure, CP violated its obligations of providing a weekly service to Univar, one of the country‚Äôs biggest chemical distributors, isolated by the incident. In 2016, the right-of-way north of Marpole, inactive for over a decade, was sold to become the Arbutus Greenway. After a barge collision that year, CP removed the swing span within days, and its platform in 2017. The track west of the Ontario St. yard appears unused.

It was directed by Shoji Kawamori. It was released in North America by Tokyopop. Miyazawa and the other characters in the program are depicted as cats, similar to the anime adaptation of Miyazawa's story Night on the Galactic Railroad. The North American title Spring and Chaos derives from the title of Miyazawa's poetry collection Spring and Asura (Haru to Shura), the title poem of which is recited in part in the program. The \\"Ihatov\\" in the Japanese title is a setting in a number of Miyazawa's works; it is the word Miyazawa created in Esperanto for his place of residence, Japan's Iwate Prefecture. Plot The story follows Kenji Miyazawa through different periods of his life, centering primarily on his relationships with his sister, his father, his students, and the farmers in his area. The film opens with a sequence of Kenji carrying snow in his hands and chasing after a moving train containing his sister Toshi. Suddenly the ground splits and the train descends into the sea, as Kenji sinks to his knees and calls his sister's name. In the real world, Kenji's students sit in their classroom and gossip about the strangeness of their teacher. Kenji enters through the window and proceeds to tell the students to shut their books and close their eyes, explaining principles of heat and temperature to them. Then he leads his students on an outdoor excursion, demonstrating the eccentric teaching style that Miyazawa was known for. Six years earlier, Kenji walks through natural landscapes with his friend, Kanai Hosaka. Looking at two telegraph poles, he gets the inspiration for his poem Telegraph Poles on a Moonlit Night. He talks about his dreams for the future with Kanai on a mountaintop while gazing at a beautiful field of stars. Upon returning home with an armful of rocks he has collected, he witnesses his father at work at the family pawnshop business, in the middle of insisting that he cannot give a poor farmer any more money for his goods. Kenji later argues with his father about the business, decrying the practice of profiting off the poor. However, he is cheered by his sister Toshi; he asks her if she has read his poem in Azalea, a reference to the magazine that Miyazawa started with his friends. Toshi starts to cough violently and Kenji rushes to her aid. In 1923 Kenji moves to Tokyo out of depression, working at a small publishing out. He meets his friend Kanai again after three years, but Kanai now believes Kenji to be too idealistic, and says that they cannot walk the path they dreamed of together after all. Kenji returns shortly afterwards to Hanamaki to be with Toshi, who is very sick and talks about her fear of death. Kenji reads her a story of his and describes his writing methods and the inspiration he takes from nature. His creative process is depicted in an abstract sequence showing birds, bears, a winged Kenji, and numerous other images in varying art styles. Kenji's father berates him for printing so many copies of his book, which no one ended up reading. Kenji declares that he doesn't write to sell books. In the classroom his students read his poetry collection Spring and Asura, but they all profess to not understand it. Kenji observes the farmers toiling slavishly in the fields and becomes overcome with emotion, hit with a sudden hallucination of being trapped and surrounded by water filled with skeletal corpses and fearful spirits. He comes to with his students worrying around him. They then tell him about a student who has been stealing from his classmates; Kenji catches the student and tells the boy to follow him, travelling a long way through difficult natural terrain until they reach a mountaintop. There Kenji asks the boy about his motives for stealing, offering selflessly to give the boy his entire salary and to get him however much money he needs. He learns that the young boy is from a poor family of farmers. Kenji makes up his mind to quit teaching and to work the fields alongside the other farmers. He is unused to the work, and the other farmers scoff at him and view him as a weak amateur. As a sung version of Miyazawa's famous poem Ame ni mo Makezu plays in the background, Kenji works in the field in the day and teaches the farmers about art and literature as well as new fertilizing techniques during the evening. However, many other farmers still do not warm up to him, continuing to think of him as spoiled and rich, even sabotaging his crop while he is away. He works himself to exhaustion farming and hallucinates once again, leading to a rapid series of flashbacks. He despairs and thinks of one of his last moments with his sister, when she asks him to bring her fresh snow and he feeds it to her in bed. As Kenji lies desolately in the field, all of a sudden a pair of trains burst up from the ground and towards the sky, referencing Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, the basis for which was said to be his sister's death. Seeing this, he is able to regain hope. He recites a segment of his poem Spring and Asura.

Appleroth's backyard business, Traders Pty Ltd, became one of Australia's largest family-operated food manufacturers and was sold to McCormick Foods Australia, a subsidiary of United States corporation McCormick & Company, in 1995. Aeroplane Jelly is the market leader in Australia's jelly market, with over 18 million packets sold annually. Strawberry is the best- selling flavour. Aeroplane Jelly ran a successful advertising campaign featuring a jingle that has become part of Australian culture. It is one of Australia's longest-running jingles, recorded in 1937 featuring two the voice of five-year-old Joy King. It was played on radio over 100 times per day in the 1940s. The jingle was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2008. History Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, known as Bert Appleroth, was a tram conductor who created jelly crystals using gelatine and sugar in his bath. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite. Appleroth's company, Traders Pty Ltd, was run by his son, Bert II, then grandson, Bert III, and ownership passed to Bert III's wife Val when he died in 1985. According to Traders' managing director, Hugh Knox, the Appleroth family were friends with a former managing director of McCormick & Company, which opened up negotiations between the parties. Aeroplane Jelly was sold to McCormick Foods Australia in 1995, the Australian subsidiary of the United States-based McCormick & Company. The first Aeroplane Jelly factory was located in Paddington, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, then manufactured in West Ryde for 33 years. In 2006, McCormick Foods Australia moved production of Aeroplane Jelly to Clayton, Victoria to centralise its manufacturing operations in Victoria.  Advertising  The Aeroplane Jelly jingle was composed by Albert Francis Lenertz (1891‚Äì1943), Appleroth's business partner. The jingle was a re-working of Lenertz's earlier political jingle in tribute to Australian Prime Minister William Morris Hughes. A minor controversy occurred in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1988 over authorship of the song, with claims made on behalf of vaudeville actress Peggy Thorne, pianist of the Musician's Lodge, Les Woods, and New Zealander Bill White. Cover of Aeroplane Jelly sheet music and lyrics The jingle was first sung in the early 1930s on the Goodie Reeve radio show by three-year-old Jennifer Paykel. As the commercials were broadcast live, Paykel was taken to the studio two or three times per week to sing the jingle. Paykel's mother did not renew her contract because, according to Paykel, \\"Shirley Temple was all the rage and my mother was terrified I might become a public figure like her\\". Aeroplane Jelly held a talent quest in Sydney to find a new singer and the competition was won by five-year-old Joy King. King recorded the jingle in 1937. A finalist in the same talent quest was seven-year-old Tommy Dawes, who Appleroth chose to appear as the \\"whistling boy\\" on the front of the jelly packets and advertising. According to Dawes, as a finalist he received 10 guineas and an onyx inkstand, but has received no other compensation for the use of his image or his recorded version of the jingle. Dawes said, \\"It was absolutely fantastic; I loved seeing my picture and singing the song and all my friends were very impressed... I have never wanted any money from it... I just like telling everyone that I'm the Aeroplane Jelly boy.\\" In 1966, the jingle was recorded in Greek, Italian, Russian and Yugoslav, and became one of Australia's first advertising campaigns to target ethnic groups. Versions of the jingle have been recorded by The Andrews Sisters and Victor Borge. At its peak in the 1940s, the jingle was played over 100 times per day on radio stations, and it is one of the longest-running jingles in Australia. In 2003, Aeroplane Jelly marked its 75th anniversary with a national competition to record a new version of the jingle and raise money for the Starlight Children's Foundation. A McCormick spokesperson described the number of submissions as \\"overwhelming\\". The competition was won by Queensland's Palm Beach State School, who re-recorded the jingle with runners-up Park Ridge Primary School from Victoria. Brisbane advertising agencies named the Aeroplane Jelly jingle one of the best and most recognisable advertisement catchphrases of the past 40 years, a runner-up to Mortein's \\"Louie the Fly\\" jingle. In June 2008, Joy King's recording of the jingle was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Bertie the Aeroplane was introduced as Aeroplane Jelly's mascot in 1942. Named after Bert Appleroth, Bertie sung the jingle in cinema advertising. Bertie was later featured in television advertisements and reappeared in 1996 on jelly packaging and the Aeroplane Jelly website. Products The Australian jelly industry is worth approximately $1121 million per annum, and Aeroplane Jelly is the market leader with a 25% share. Over 19 million packets of Aeroplane Jelly are sold each year. Strawberry flavour is the top selling jelly variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, Aeroplane Jelly introduced Australia's first low calorie jelly. In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, jelly was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992. Now Aeroplane Jelly is owned by American company, McCormicks foods; it used to be owned by Traders Pty Ltd. One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets per annum.

A number of towns are on the banks of the river including the royal town of Kuala Kangsar. Most of the settlements in what is today Perak were situated near the river until the 19th century, when tin deposits were discovered elsewhere, most notably Ipoh. The source of Sungei Perak is in the mountainous Perak-Kelantan-Thailand border of the Belum Forest Reserve. Some of the branches of the river are the Bidor River and the Kinta River. The Temenggor Dam has created a large man-made lake at Banding near Grik. History View of Perak River at Bota (Bhota) in 1874. One of the streams that flows into the Perak River is known locally as the Sungai Kangsar (Kangsar River). The portion that enjoins the main Perak River is known as Kuala. Overlooking the river bank there is a hill where the British Resident for Perak resided and appropriately named as Bukit Residen (Residence Hill). During the British occupation the British Resident being Advisor to the Sultan will conduct the Council Meeting with the Sultan and Chieftains from the districts at Bukit Residen. The council meeting was usually a pompous event with Chieftains coming with sailing boats and the Royalty and palace officials came riding on elephants. The subjects camped at the foot of the Bukit Residen for days as the Council Meeting was usually more than three days. For the subjects the Council meeting was a festival where they congregated at river bank. The subjects and locals had free flows of food and cultural activities at the river bank. Thus the local dialects named the confluence of Kangsar River and Perak River as Kuala Kangsar, Kangsar was coined from the word Council and Kuala means confluence of river.  Literature  The Perak is mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's story The Crab That Played with the Sea (published as one of the Just So Stories). There, the man complains to his creator, the eldest magician, about the tides running into and out from the Perak: \\"Once a day and once a night the Sea runs up the Perak river and drives the sweet-water back into the forest, so that my house is made wet; once a day and once a night it runs down the river and draws all the water after it, so that there is nothing left but mud, and my canoe is upset.\\" Course The Perak River is the second-longest river in peninsular Malaysia. The river sources from the highlands in Upper Perak region, near the Thai border. It then flows through the regions two largest towns of Gerik and Lenggong, before meeting with the Kangsar River at the royal seat of Kuala Kangsar. It then enters the Perak Tengah region, flowing through the towns of Parit, Pasir Salak and Kampung Gajah, before emptying into the Straits of Malacca just outside Teluk Intan in the Hilir Perak (Lower Perak) region.

It has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggests it belongs in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee. The adult barred becard is 12 cm long and weighs 14 g; it has a conspicuous eye-ring. The adult male has black upperparts with much white in the wings. The sides of the head and throat have yellowish-green shading to white on the rest of the underparts. The underparts are finely barred with black. The adult female has a grey crown and nape, olive-green upperparts and largely rufous wings. The greenish-yellow underparts are finely barred and dusky. Young males are much duller and greener than the adults, with weaker barring. The calls include a soft but persistent weet weet weet weet or a teseep tesep tseep tseep. The barred becard is found in the canopy and middle levels of mountain forests, coming lower at edges and in adjacent more open woodland. It is mainly found at altitudes between 1500‚Äì2500 m, sometimes higher early in the year. Barred becards actively pick large insects and spiders off the foliage in flight. They also regularly hover to take small berries. They can occur singly, in pairs or family groups, or often as part of a mixed-species feeding flock. The nest, built by the female in a high fork of a tree branch 15‚Äì23 m up, is a 30 cm diameter spherical structure of plant material with a low entrance. The typical clutch is two dark brown-blotched brownish white eggs, laid between April and June and incubated by the female alone for 18‚Äì20 days to hatching. The male helps to feed the young.

Early life Blaxland was born in Kent, the eldest son of gentleman farmer John Blaxland and Mary, n√©e Parker, of Fordwich, Kent, England. He was the older brother of early Australian explorer Gregory Blaxland. His father died when he was eleven and the family moved to Canterbury where he and his brother were educated at The King's School. In 1787 he joined the army and rose to become a captain. He resigned his commission in 1792 and returned to manage the family estates at Newington, Kent. He was married twice: to Sarah Davies from 1794 until her death in childbirth in 1795, and to Harriet, daughter of Jean Louis de Marquett (a merchant of Calcutta and a former guard of Louis XVI), from 1797 until his death in 1845. He and Harriet had four sons and six daughters. Australia In 1805 John and his younger brother Gregory were persuaded by Joseph Banks to emigrate to Australia. Blaxland made a good bargain with the English government which agreed that if he brought ¬£6000 to the colony he would be granted of land, the labour of 80 convicts who would be fed for 18 months by the government, and a free passage for himself, his wife, children and servants. Gregory was the first to sail to New South Wales while John remained to sell the family estate in Kent. John reached Sydney on 4 April 1807, having, in conjunction with Hulletts brothers, of London, built The Three Brothers, a ship of 252 tons, carrying eight guns and a crew of 21 to bring himself, his wife, and four daughters, a governess, two female servants, a bailiff, a carpenter, a man for agricultural purposes and a boy to this land, Oliver Russell being the master. He arrived with instructions to Governor Bligh to give him various concessions in place of the free passage. Bligh was no more helpful than he thought necessary, but Blaxland obtained cattle from the government herd, and started a dairy in Sydney, and also sold meat and vegetables. Blaxland did a very useful piece of work in reducing the prices of these necessities, but Bligh insisted that he should go in for agriculture as well as grazing. He antagonized Blaxland, who joined in the deposition of Bligh in January 1808, but Blaxland could not get the concessions he wanted from Colonel Johnston. Newington House Newington House, Silverwater, c.1894 Within ten days of the First Fleet arriving in Australia, records had been made of \\"The Flats\\", the extensive tidal wetlands at Homebush Bay. Between the years 1788 and 1831, blocks of land ranging from 100 to 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) were given out to the first European settlers by dividing up the Wanng-al clans' land. These land grants were inked in on County of Cumberland maps, with names of owners and land granted clearly indicated. In 1807, John Blaxland acquired 520 hectares of land, reserving the original grants of Waterhouse, Shortland, Archer and Haslam. He named the estate Newington after his family estate in Kent, England.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.243, Blaxland established a series of salt pans on the banks of the Parramatta River and by 1827, was producing 8 tons of salt each week for the Sydney market. Blaxland also established a tweed mill, limekiln and flourmill. In 1843, Blaxland mortgaged the property to the Australian Trust Company. After he died in 1851 the Trust Company sold the property to John Dobie to recover the mortgage. The Blaxland family re-purchased the estate from Dobie in 1854 but offered it as security against a large loan. The property was transferred to the Official Assignee of the Insolvent Estate of Edward James Blaxland in 1860 and subsequently leased to the Methodist Church, who established Newington College on the estate. The building is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishers, 1981, p.2/11 Return to England Blaxland then decided to return to England. Bligh, however, succeeded in getting him arrested at Cape Town and taken to London. After three years in London he obtained a letter to Macquarie directing that the original agreement should be carried out. But Macquarie was obsessed with the idea that the land grants were for the purpose of growing grain and put various obstacles in his way. Return to Australia Blaxland returned to Sydney on 27 February 1818, on board the Laurel. With him was Mak Sai Ying, the first known Chinese man to settle in Australia. Mak Sai Ying was later to negotiate land deals favourable to Blaxland, while working as a carpenter, until 1821. However, in the 1820s, under Governor Brisbane, Blaxland obtained good land in the Nepean (800 acres called \\"Grove Farm\\" where he had built a weir and brewery where barley and English soft wheat were grown at what became Wallacia) and Hunter Regions as a result of discovering a route to the area. His grant was in the area now known as Broke and by 1830 he had established a mill in the nearby area of Fordwich.Singleton Website:Retrieved 23 December 2009 Over the years he was successful as a stock owner. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1829 to 1844 and died at Newington on 5 August 1845. Family and descendants Blaxland married twice, firstly to Sarah Davies (who died during childbirth) and secondly to Harriott de Marquett, daughter of Jean Louis de Marquett (a Calcutta merchant and a bodyguard of Louis XVI). He was survived by several sons and daughters from his second marriage. His younger brother, Gregory Blaxland of Blue Mountains crossing fame committed suicide a few years after his death. Their eldest daughter Harriott firstly married Calcutta merchant Alexander Macdonald Ritchie with whom she bore three children: Elizabeth, Arthur and Alexander. Through her family connections (both maternal and spousal) Harriott spent some time in India and wrote an account of a suti or widow-burning, the account is now in the Library of New South Wales. Harriott and Alexander's daughter, Elizabeth, marriedAn account of Elizabeth's wedding is also held in the Library of New South Wales a Welshman, Charles Boydell, who was a pioneer in the Hunter Valley, in particular, Gresford, New South Wales where he had a property called Camyr Allyn.Diary of Charles Boydell at http://archival- classic.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?acmsID=449192&itemID;=823718 Charles' brother William married the daughter of the first Anglican Archbishop of Australia, William Broughton, also an alumnus of the King's School, Canterbury. From Elizabeth's line, descendants married into families such as the wine-making Lindemans. From Arthur's line, descendants married into the British nobility.Lady Dowling returned to England and died there in 1881. Arthur's daughter Helen married into the Hubbard nobility. Harriott, as Mrs Ritchie, was the subject of a romantic tryst with French navigator Hyacinthe de Bougainville.As mentioned in Colin Dyer's book, The French Explorers in Sydney (2009, UQP) In de Bougainville's account, the navigator was pleasantly surprised to find an Anglo-French speaking family in the colony, connections to Louis XVI and praised Blaxland as a truly English gentleman. After Alexander Ritchie's death, eldest Harriott married the second Chief Justice of NSW, fellow widower Sir James Dowling, thereafter becoming Lady Dowling. Furthermore, Lady Dowling's father, who was known as a liberal, made Sir James pointed out the difficulties of advancement in the colony for having so close a connection to a \\"Kentish whig\\":p.99 in Sir James Dowling: Second Chief Justice of New South Wales, 1837-1844 by John Michael Bennett, Sydney: The Federation Press Dowling recognised that his recent remarriage to Harriott Ritchie, a widow, (\\"the daughter of a most respectable man and worthy gentleman...and an honest upright man...who has the misfortune to be a Kentish whig\\"), might weigh against him. Their second daughter, Anne, married Thomas Walker who had considerable holdings in the area now known as Rhodes. Their eldest son, John de Marquet, who died young and unmarried, was an early explorer and cattle drover who found a passage from Sydney to Cessnock where his family were granted land holdings. Blaxland Arm near the town of Laguna, New South Wales is named after him.In particular, land holdings granted to the three Ritchie children: Elizabeth, Arthur and Alexander near Broke. Their youngest daughter, Louisa Australia (so named as she was the first of the Blaxland children born in Australia), lobbied the State Government and Sir Henry Parkes to keep the family estate intact and preserved to no avail. The family's (with the Walker's) extensive documents are held in the archives of the State Library of New South Wales. John Blaxland was a keen man of business, anxious to drive a good bargain, and as a free settler was in a stronger position than the emancipists. But he antagonized both Bligh and Macquarie and met with much opposition. In spite of this Blaxland as a pioneer grazier became an important figure as the quintessential 19th century enlightened English gentleman in the early development of Australia.

The criterion is often stated as follows: :If a prime number p is expressed in base 10 as p=a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\\\cdots+a_110+a_0 (where 0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq 9) then the polynomial ::f(x)=a_mx^m+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1x+a_0 :is irreducible in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]. The theorem can be generalized to other bases as follows: :Assume that b \\\\ge 2 is a natural number and p(x)=a_kx^k+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1x+a_0 is a polynomial such that 0\\\\leq a_i\\\\leq b-1. If p(b) is a prime number then p(x) is irreducible in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]. The base-10 version of the theorem is attributed to Cohn by P√≥lya and Szeg≈ë in one of their books English translation in: while the generalization to any base b is due to Brillhart, Filaseta, and Odlyzko. In 2002, Ram Murty gave a simplified proof as well as some history of the theorem in a paper that is available online.

It is directed by John G. Avildsen and stars Allen Garfield. The story, based on the Michael Brett novel Lie a Little, Die a Little, follows the misadventures of a slobbish private detective who is hired by a millionaire to investigate a murder. The film features one of Paul Sorvino's first screen performances, and an early appearance from TV star Debbi Morgan. Plot Private detective Jake Masters is with his girlfriend Renee when he gets a call about a new case. The New York City Police Department is hunting for an eccentric millionaire, Jason Dominic, in connection with the murder of a cocktail waitress named Lucille Reynolds. Jason wants Jake to find the real killer. Jake goes to LaGuardia Airport to pick up Jason's bodyguard, Cora Merrill. After an initial case of mistaken identity, Jake, his trainee nephew Keith, and Cora meet up and visit Jason's yacht. Jason tells them the police believe he killed Lucille because she had filmed an orgy featuring him with three prostitutes, who then blackmailed him out of $50,000. Jake, Keith, and Cora go back to Jake's apartment. Cora rebuffs Jake's advances and instead has sex with Keith. The three start working through their list of prostitutes and other unsavory suspects one by one. While questioning a man, Cora becomes violent, leading Jake to exclude her from questioning others afterward. During one encounter, two prostitutes and a male suspect tie up Jake, but the male suspect goes outside and is killed by an unknown person. Jake then follows one of the prostitutes to an apartment and rapes her before realizing that she is dead. By chance, Jake finds out that Cora's story does not make sense. He realizes that she is actually working on the orders of Jason to kill the blackmailers after Jake has located them. Jake notifies the police of this. He then goes back to his apartment and has sex with Cora. Afterward, he confronts her, and she admits to killing all of the suspects. A struggle ensues, and Cora is killed by the police. Renee then surprises Jake at his apartment, and the two are happy to be reunited.

The Gallic rooster (, Gallic cock) is an unofficial national symbol of France as a nation, as opposed to Marianne representing France as a state, and its values: the Republic. The rooster is also the symbol of the Wallonia region and the French Community of Belgium. France war memorial in La Rochelle During the times of Ancient Rome, Suetonius, in The Twelve Caesars, noticed that, in Latin, rooster (gallus) and Gauls (Gallus) were homonyms. However, the association of the Gallic rooster as a national symbol is apocryphal, as the rooster was neither regarded as a national personification nor as a sacred animal by the Gauls in their mythology and because there was no \\"Gallic nation\\" at the time, but a loose confederation of Gallic nations instead. But a closer review within that religious scheme indicates that \\"Mercury\\" was often portrayed with the cockerel, a sacred animal among the Continental Celts. Julius Caesar in De Bello Gallico identified some gods worshipped in Gaul by using the names of their nearest Roman god rather than their Gaulish name, with Caesar saying \\"Mercury\\" was the god most revered in Gaul. The Irish god Lug identified as samild√°nach led to the widespread identification of Caesar's Mercury as Lugus and thus also to the sacred cockerel, the Gallic rooster, as an emblem of France. Its association with France dates back from the Middle Ages and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus, meaning an inhabitant of Gaul, and gallus, meaning rooster, or cockerel. Its use, by the enemies of France, dates to this period, originally a pun to make fun of the French, the association between the rooster and the Gauls/French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents: prior to being arrested, Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning. At the rooster's crowing, Peter remembered Jesus's words. Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil. It is also an emblem of the Christian's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment of humankind. That is why, during the Renaissance, the rooster became a symbol of France as a Catholic state and became a popular Christian image on weather vanes, also known as weathercocks. Gallic rooster atop a World War I memorial, Liomer (Somme). French national rugby team, with the traditional Gallic rooster symbol The popularity of the Gallic rooster as a national personification faded away until its resurgence during the French Revolution (1789). The republican historiography completely modified the traditional perception of the origins of France. Until then, the royal historiography dated the origins of France back to the baptism of Clovis I in 496, the \\"first Christian king of France\\". The republicans rejected this royalist and Christian origin of the country and trace the origins of France back to the ancient Gaul. Although purely apocryphal, the rooster became the personification of the early inhabitants of France, the Gauls. The Gallic rooster, colloquially named Chantecler, had been a national emblem ever since, especially during the Third Republic. The rooster was featured on the reverse of French 20-franc gold pieces from 1899 to 1914. After World War I it was depicted on countless war memorials. Today, it is often used as a national mascot, particularly in sporting events such as football (soccer) and rugby. The 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted by France, adopted an anthropomorphic rooster named Footix as its mascot. Two decades later, the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, also hosted by France, featured a young anthropomorphic female chicken known as ettie (officially in lower case) as its mascot, with ettie being depicted as the daughter of Footix. The France national rugby league team are known as the Chanteclairs, referring to the cockerel's song. The popularity of the symbol extends into business through several notable brands: * Le Coq Sportif (\\"The athletic rooster\\"), a French manufacturer of sports equipment using a stylized rooster and the colors of the French tricolour as its logo, * the logo of Path√©, a French-born, now international company of film production and distribution, * Ayam Brand, an Asia-wide food company based in Singapore founded by a Frenchman in 1892 formerly known as \\"A. Clouet & Co.\\", the name came from the Malay word ayam meaning \\"chicken\\" in reference to the rooster adorning many of the Clouet products at the time. Another heraldic animal officially used by the French nation was the French Imperial Eagle, symbol of the First and Second French Empire under Napoleon I and Napoleon III. Wallonia Walloon rooster. In 1913, the Gallic rooster was adopted as the symbol of Walloon movement. It represents a \\"bold rooster\\" (coq hardi), raising its claws, instead of the \\"crowing rooster\\" that is traditionally depicted in France. This symbol, also known as the Walloon rooster, was officially adopted as the symbol of Wallonia (in 1998) and the French Community of Belgium (in 1991). Cocorico In France and Wallonia, the French onomatopoeia for the rooster crowing sound, \\"cocorico\\" (cock-a-doodle- doo), is sometimes used as an expression of national pride.

During her husband's period as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, she became known for her philanthropic work and her travels throughout south-eastern Australia. After John Franklin's disappearance in search of the Northwest passage, she sponsored or otherwise supported several expeditions to determine his fate. Early life Jane was the second daughter of John Griffin, a liveryman and later governor of the Goldsmith's Company, and his wife Jane Guillemard. There was Huguenot ancestry on both sides of her family. She was born in London, where she was raised with her sisters Frances and Mary at the family house, 21 Bedford Place,Penn Club newsletter: Retrieved 24 August 2011. just off Russell Square. She was well educated, and her father being well-to-do had her education completed by much travel on the continent. Her portrait was chalked when she was 24 by Am√©lie Munier-Romilly at Geneva. Marriage to John Franklin As a young woman, Jane was strongly attracted to a London physician and scientist, Dr. Peter Mark Roget, best known for publishing Roget's Thesaurus. She once said he was the only man who made her swoon, but nothing ever came of the relationship. Jane had been a friend of John Franklin's first wife, the poet Eleanor Anne Porden, who died early in 1825. In 1828, Franklin and Jane Griffin became engaged. They married on 5 November 1828, and in 1829 he was knighted. During the next three years, she spent lengthy periods apart from her husband while he served in the Mediterranean. In 1836, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), disembarking from the immigrant ship Fairlie on 6 January 1837. Relationship with the colonies of Australia and New Zealand Jane, Lady Franklin portrait, 1838 Lady Franklin at once began to take an interest in the colony and did a good deal of exploring along the southern and western coast. In 1839, she became the first European woman to travel overland between Port Phillip and Sydney. In April that year, Lady Franklin visited the new settlement at Melbourne, where she received an address signed by 63 of the leading citizens which referred to her \\"character for kindness, benevolence and charity\\". With her husband, she encouraged the founding of secondary schools for both boys and girls, including Christ's College. In 1841 she traveled to New Zealand meeting both Ernst Dieffenbach and William Colenso, who named the filmy fern Hymenophyllum frankliniae in her honour. In the same year, she visited South Australia and persuaded the governor, Colonel George Gawler, to set aside some ground overlooking Spencer Gulf for a monument to Matthew Flinders. This was set up later in the year. In 1842, she and her attendant, Christiana Stewart, were the first European women to travel overland from Hobart to Macquarie Harbour. She had much correspondence with Elizabeth Fry about the female convicts, and did what she could to ameliorate their lot. In 1841 the convict ship Rajah arrived loaded with convict women who had been supplied with sewing materials organised by Lydia Irving of Fry's convict ship committee.Amanda Phillips, ‚ÄòIrving, Lydia (1797‚Äì1893)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 June 2017 The quilt is now one of the most treasured textiles in Australia. She was accused of using undue influence with her husband in his official acts but there is no evidence of this. When Franklin was recalled at the end of 1843, they went first to Melbourne by the schooner Flying Fish and then to England by way of New Zealand on board, coincidentally, the barque Rajah. In 1842, she commissioned a classical temple, and named it Ancanthe, 'blooming valley'. She intended the building to serve as a museum for Hobart, and left in trust to ensure the continuance of what she hoped would become the focus of the colony's cultural aspirations. A century of apathy followed, with the museum used as an apple shed among other functions; but in 1949 it was made the home of the Art Society of Tasmania, who rescued the building. It is now known as the Lady Franklin Gallery. Following the disappearance of her husband Lady Franklin's  ªahu ªula, a Hawaiian feather cape presented to her by King Kamehameha IV during her visit in 1861, Bishop Museum. Her husband started on his last voyage in May 1845, and when it was realized that he must have come to disaster, Lady Franklin devoted herself for many years to trying to ascertain his fate. Until shortly before her own death, Lady Franklin travelled extensively, generally accompanied by her husband's niece Sophia Cracroft, who remained her secretary and companion until her death. Lady Franklin travelled to Out Stack in the Shetland Islands of Scotland, the northernmost of the British isles, to get as close as she could to her missing husband. Lady Franklin sponsored seven expeditions to find her husband or his records (two of the expeditions failed to reach the Arctic): * 1850 Prince Albert under Charles Codrington Forsyth and William Parker Snow * 1851 Prince Albert under William Kennedy and Joseph Ren√© Bellot, * 1852 Isabel (one under Donald Beatson aborted, the other under Edward Inglefield explored Greenland) * 1853 Isabel (William Kennedy and Robert Grate, aborted) * 1857 Fox under Francis Leopold McClintock, and * 1875 Pandora under Allen Young By means of sponsorship, use of influence, and offers of sizeable rewards for information about him, she instigated or supported many other searches. Her efforts made the expedition's fate one of the most vexed questions of the decade. Ultimately, in 1859, Francis McClintock found evidence that Sir John had died twelve years previously, in 1847. Prior accounts had suggested that, in the end, the expedition had turned to cannibalism to survive, but Lady Franklin refused to believe these stories and poured scorn on explorer John Rae, who had in fact been the first person to return with definite news of her husband's fate. Lady Franklin was openly racist against Inuit. The popularity of the Franklins in the Australian colonies was such that when it was learned in 1852 that Lady Franklin was organising an expedition in search of her husband using the auxiliary steamship Isabel, subscriptions were taken up, and those in Van Diemens Land alone totalled ¬£1671/13/4. Although McClintock had found conclusive evidence that Sir John Franklin and his fellow expeditioners were dead, Lady Franklin remained convinced that their written records might remain buried in a cache in the Arctic. She provided moral and some financial support for multiple later expeditions that planned to seek the records, including those of William Parker Snow Trevelyan, Raleigh, A Pre-Raphaelite Circle, Chatto and Windus, 1978, and Charles Francis Hall Chauncey C. Loomis, Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer, New York, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc, 1971. in the 1860s. Finally, in 1874, she joined forces with Allen Young to purchase and fit out the former steam gunboat HMS Pandora to undertake another expedition to the region around Prince of Wales Island. The expedition left London in June 1875 and returned in December, unsuccessful, as ice prevented her from passing west of the Franklin Strait. Lady Franklin died in the interim, on 18 July 1875. At her funeral on 29 July, the pall-bearers included Captains McClintock, Collinson and Ommanney, R.N., while many other \\"Old Arctics\\" engaged in the Franklin searches were also in attendance. She was interred at Kensal Green Cemetery in the vault, and commemorated on a marble cross dedicated to her niece Sophia Cracroft. Legacy Lady Franklin was a woman of unusual character and personality. Her determined efforts, in connection with which she spent a great deal of her own money to discover the fate of her husband, added much to the world's knowledge of the arctic regions. It was said: 'What the nation would not do, a woman did'. In addition, as one of the earliest women in Tasmania who had had the full benefit of education and cultural surroundings, she was both an example and a force, and set a new standard in ways of living to the more prosperous settlers who had passed the stage of merely struggling for a living. Natural features named after her include Lady Franklin Bay, on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut; Lady Franklin Rock, an island in the Fraser River near Yale, British Columbia, named at the end of her visit there during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush; Lady Franklin Rock, near Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park in California; and Mount Lady Jane Franklin, a hill near Barnawartha in Northern Victoria, which she climbed on her trip from Port Phillip to Sydney in 1839. Jane Franklin Hall, a residential college in Hobart, Tasmania, is named in her honour, as is the art gallery mentioned above. The ballad \\"Lady Franklin's Lament\\" commemorated her search for her lost husband. The sailing vessel Jane Franklin, an Amel Super Maramu ketch, also bears her name. Lady Jane Franklin Drive in Spilsby, Lincolnshire is named after her. Most of Lady Franklin's surviving papers are held by the Scott Polar Research Institute.  In popular culture  Jane Franklin appears as a character in the 2018 television series The Terror, where she is portrayed by Greta Scacchi.

In Roman numerals for example, X means ten and L means fifty. Hence LXXX means eighty (50 + 10 + 10 + 10). There is no need for zero in sign-value notation. Sign-value notation was the ancient way of writing numbers and only gradually evolved into place-value notation, also known as positional notation. When ancient people wanted to write \\"two sheep\\" in clay, they could inscribe in clay a picture of two sheep. But this would be impractical when they wanted to write \\"twenty sheep\\". In Mesopotamia they used small clay tokens to represent a number of a specific commodity, and strung the tokens like beads on a string, which were used for accounting. There was a token for one sheep and a token for ten sheep, and a different token for ten goats, etc. To ensure that nobody could alter the number and type of tokens, they invented a clay envelope shaped like a hollow ball into which the tokens on a string were placed and then baked. If anybody contested the number, they could break open the clay envelope and do a recount. To avoid unnecessary damage to the record, they pressed archaic number signs on the outside of the envelope before it was baked, each sign similar in shape to the tokens they represented. Since there was seldom any need to break open the envelope, the signs on the outside became the first written language for writing numbers in clay, using sign-value notation.

[...] And, he has more scenes to tape later this week.\\" In May 2015, it was confirmed that Gregory was no longer in the role, and a casting call seeking a \\"handsome, tall, Caucasian man in his 20s with a great physique\\" to play Thomas was released.

Speaking on his casting, Atkinson told Soap Opera Digest: \\"It was actually a long time coming. I remember this role coming around a few years ago. When it came around this time, [having worked at Y&R;], I knew everyone there. I had met Brad [Bell, executive producer/head writer] before, and I couldn't say no ... There's something very comforting now about being back in the same building.\\" =Characterization= The character is described \\"As the extremely attractive and charming heir of Forrester Creations\\" and \\"this wide-eyed prodigy is a visionary and famed designer in the making, fully aware that the eyes of the fashion world, as well as every single girl in town, are fixated on his every move\\".B&B; Character Descriptions ‚Äî Thomas There was brief speculation that the character was going gay;Michael Fairman: Is B&B;'s Thomas going to turn out to be gay after all? however this was never a storyline. Bell has stated that this new Thomas will become an exact replica of how his father Ridge Forrester was when he was a young playboy at the beginning of the show. Storylines =1998‚Äì2003= When Taylor Hayes, Thomas' mother, discovered the pregnancy, she attempted to tell Ridge Forrester (his father) in a joyous mood. However once she saw him being seduced by Brooke Logan once again she nearly lost the baby due to stress. So that Ridge could be happy with Brooke, Taylor told everyone (and Brooke was in on this lie as well) that Thorne Forrester, Ridge's brother, was the father. Shortly after Thomas's birth Taylor saw the unmistakable bond between Ridge and her baby and realized that Ridge wasn't in love at the time to Brooke, so she confessed to Ridge that he was the father. She explained the reasons she went along with the deception. Furious with Brooke, Ridge was overjoyed and declared his love for Taylor and proposed to her and they were then married. Shortly after Thomas, Taylor and Ridge had twins, Steffy and Phoebe At long last, Taylor and Ridge had the child they had always wanted. Thomas' childhood was far from easy, at a young age his sister Steffy was thought to be dead, however was kidnapped. Also, his mother, Taylor was presumed dead in 2002 after being shot by Sheila Carter defending Brooke. After Taylor's death, Brooke took over as parent for the children and married Ridge. =2004‚Äì2013= Thomas and Brooke end up in a plane crash when they go to promote the Taboo line overseas. They end up stranded, their bodies washed ashore. The whole family is extremely worried, and goes on an agonizing search across the seas for them. Brooke eats poisonous berries on the island after she and Thomas have gone two to three days without food and gives some to him. It caused them to have weird dreams and imagine themselves in an odd alternate world. Ridge comes to the rescue of Brooke and his son. Both Thomas and Brooke wonder what happened on the island, as they experienced strange feelings after eating the berries (they are both under the impression that they could have had sexual relations). Stephanie (always wanting to get rid of Brooke from the family) tells Thomas to lie to everyone and say that he and Brooke had sex on the island, so that Ridge would leave Brooke for Taylor. As Taylor and Ridge are about to get married, Stephanie and Thomas reveal the whole truth (which was eating Thomas alive). Thomas' girlfriend Dayzee (who encouraged him to tell the truth, knowing about the scandal) left him after that. The whole family finds it hard to forgive him, but Taylor does and blames Stephanie for the incident. Ridge and Brooke don't forgive Thomas for this, and move him to the Shipping Department of Forrester Creations. Thomas later begins a relationship with Hope Logan (his adoptive step-sister). She was previously in a relationship with Liam Spencer who is now married to his younger sister Steffy. They share a kiss and begin to date, and he proposes to Hope in Mexico where she briefly accepts by saying 'its too soon now, but maybe someday it will happen.' After Hope finds out that Thomas had been encouraged to date her by Steffy to keep Hope away from Liam, Hope breaks up with Thomas, leaving him hurt because he genuinely wanted to be with Hope. Thomas meets the new designer at Forrester Creations, Caroline Spencer, whom Brooke had hired to set her up with Rick. However, Thomas catches Caroline's attention, and they go out on a date. They even kiss while they dance. Thomas and Caroline grow closer, and when she introduces him to her mother Karen, and Karen's partner Danielle, Thomas is at first surprised by Caroline's family situation but accepts it and supports it, which Caroline appreciates and they continue their relationship. Thomas and Caroline begin to get serious, even though Rick is interested in Caroline and intends to steal her away from Thomas. The relationship intensifies as they both spend more time together. However, Caroline is soon jealous of Thomas' ex-girlfriend Hope, who suddenly (thanks to Rick) is single. The chemistry between Hope and Thomas stirs up trouble for Caroline and Thomas' relationship, and Rick takes advantage by fueling Caroline's jealousy of Hope. Thomas' mother Taylor begins an affair with Eric and uses this to get Eric to make Thomas Vice President. Rick is angered by this but Eric orders Rick to include Thomas on everything at Forrester Creations and to work with him despite their differences. Rick begins spending most of his time at Dayzee's with Maya. The first quarter numbers come in and they are terrible due to Rick's ideas. Rick is not present at the meeting and Thomas uses this to convince Eric to support Thomas' idea of going into new trends but during his presentation Brooke comes out in her lingerie and convinces Eric to relaunch the highly successful Brooke's Bedroom, which he does much to the dismay of Thomas, Steffy, and Taylor. Thomas was said to have joined Steffy, Taylor and Ridge in Paris during fall 2013. =2015‚Äìpresent= Thomas (Fod√©) returns in July 2015 to attend his cousin Aly's (Ashlyn Pearce) funeral and decides to stick around to support Steffy who is riddled with guilt being responsible for Aly's death. He wants to rejoin the design team at Forrester Creations but Ridge accuses him of not putting his all into his designs and wanting a handout because he is a Forrester. Meanwhile, Thomas questions Caroline's relationship with Ridge because of the dramatic age difference. Despite this, he continues to offer Caroline friendship. It all comes to a head when, after Ridge breaks up with Caroline, he comforts her and they sleep together; he is unaware that she has taken anxiety pills before drinking. Ridge then quickly calls Caroline back and they marry. Thomas then becomes a confidante of Steffy during her war against Ivy. Caroline learns she is pregnant, and is at first joyful, before Ridge tells her he had a vasectomy in Paris. Realizing that the baby must be Thomas', she tells Ridge about their night together, but defends him, refusing to believe he had taken advantage of her. Ridge, angry at what Thomas has done, including a fight over an affair Thomas had with an intern which led to a fight where Thomas punched him, forces Thomas to return to Paris, leaving Forrester employees baffled. He tells Caroline the baby is his and they decide to raise it together as theirs. He later returns after Caroline convinces Ridge to stop acting angry to keep Thomas from being suspicious about the baby. He does question the baby's lineage, but accepts Caroline's claim of Ridge. Afterwards, Ridge continues to make Thomas suspicious. Thomas turns his attentions to fighting the Spencers and pursues Ivy believing her to be someone his dad can't disapprove of. Her resolve slowly breaks following an incident at Pam's Halloween party where Thomas saves her from a falling light. During a thunder storm where only the two of them are in the Forrester Mansion, they begin an affair while Wyatt, her boyfriend at the time, is out of town on business. Thomas (Atkinson) returns to Los Angeles with his son Douglas in 2019, following the sudden death of Caroline. He sets his sights on Hope as a potential replacement mother for Douglas, noting the rapport they share with each other. He eventually finds out that Hope's daughter, Beth, is still alive and threatens everyone with knowledge of this to secrecy to prevent her from going back to Liam, resulting in him killing Emma Barber (Nia Sioux) by running her off the road when she flees to confess the truth to Hope. Thomas is able to persuade Hope to get married, all the while keeping the secret that her infant daughter Beth is still alive. When the truth finally comes out, Thomas goes into hiding and Hope pursues an annulment of their marriage. After learning that Hope has gone to the beach house, Thomas surprises her there and tries to apologize for what he has done. As Hope is trying to get away from Thomas, Brooke arrives and sees Hope struggling to break free from Thomas. Brooke comes between the two and pushes Thomas away, causing him to fall over the cliff. He is rushed to the hospital in a coma, but eventually regains consciousness. When Ridge confronts him about all that he has done, Thomas tearfully confesses and begs for forgiveness.

A sailor would have one swallow tattooed before setting out on a journey, and the second swallow tattooed at the end of their tour of duty, upon return to their home port.

It is a small- to medium-sized, deciduous shrub up to tall that is native to the eastern United States. Characteristics The inflorescence is a corymb. The showy, sterile flowers are usually absent or if present they are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. Flowering occurs May to July. Fruit is a ribbed brown capsule about 2 mm long; many are produced. The leaves are large (8 to 18 cm long), opposite, serrated, ovate, and deciduous. The lower leaf surface is glabrous or with inconspicuous fine hairs, appearing green; trichomes of the lower surface are restricted to the midrib and major veins. The stem bark has a peculiar tendency to peel off in several successive thin layers with different colors, hence the common name \\"sevenbark\\". Smooth hydrangea can spread rapidly by stolons to form colonies. Taxonomy At one time both ashy hydrangea (Hydrangea cinerea) and silverleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea radiata) were considered subspecies of smooth hydrangea.McClintock, E. 1957. A monograph of the genus Hydrangea. Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences 29: 147-256. However, most taxonomists now consider them to be separate species.Pilatowski, Ronald E. A taxonomic study of the Hydrangea arborescens complex. Castanea 47: 84-98. Range and habitat Smooth hydrangea is widely distributed across the eastern United States‚Äîfrom southern New York to the panhandle of Florida, west to eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. It is mainly found in moist soils under a hardwood forest canopy and is often common along woodland road banks and streams.Lance, Ron. 2004 Woody Plants of the southeastern United States: A winter guide. The University of Georgia Press. 456 p. It is common in the Delaware River Valley and in the Appalachian Mountains. It is a host plant of the hydrangea sphinx moth. Uses This attractive native shrub is often cultivated for ornamental use.Dirr, Michael A. hydrangeas for American gardens. Timber Press. 240 p. 'Annabelle' is the best known cultivar of this species; it is one of the most cold hardy of the hydrangeas. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The cultivar 'Grandiflora' has flowers that resemble snowballs, similar to Viburnum plicatum. Smooth hydrangea root was used medicinally by Native Americans, and later, by early settlers for treatment of kidney and bladder stones.

He was provincial treasurer of the province of Saskatchewan during the Tommy Douglas era, and also served as Deputy Premier. Born in Darlington, Manitoba, Fines was educated at both the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Manitoba and received a BA. He became a teacher and principal in Regina, and would later serve three years as the President of the Regina Teachers' Association. He then served two years as the President of the Regina Branch of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation. While serving as an assistant principal at the same school as Major James Coldwell, Fines became involved with the Independent Labour Party (ILP), which Coldwell headed.Johnson, p. 13 In 1931, Fines was elected president of the ILP, at the Western Conference of Labour Political Parties.Johnson, p. 15 He strived to merge the farmer and the labour political movements under one party. In July 1932, he succeeded in merging the two movements into the Saskatchewan Farmer-Labour Party. In August, he helped organize the founding meeting of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Calgary. Fines served as a Regina City Councillor from 1934 to 1939 and from 1942 to 1944. During this time he was the chair of the Regina General Hospital, director of the Regina Exhibition Board, and a member of the parks board. Fines was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the June 15, 1944 Saskatchewan general election that saw the CCF sweep the province, becoming Canada's first Social Democratic government. He represented the Regina City constituency continuously from 1944 to 1960. Fines had a tremendous influence over the reforms made by the CCF government over the following years. As treasurer, Fines made sure that these reforms were made while producing balanced budgets. In 1944, Saskatchewan had a debt of $218 million, 38% of Saskatchewan's GDP. With successive balanced budgets, Fines brought this number down to $70 million by 1949. In 1953, Saskatchewan was debtless. For the next 16 years, all of Fines' budgets had surpluses. During his tenure as an MLA, Fines also served as the minister responsible for the Bureau of Publications, Queen's Printer Office, Government Purchasing Agency, the Liquor Board, and Saskatchewan Government Insurance. In 1960, he retired and became a corporate financial advisor, eventually going to Grenada. In 1963 he moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida where he lived the rest of his life. When he died there on October 27, 1993, he was the last surviving member of Douglas's first cabinet. In 2006, Fines appeared as a prominent character in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's docu-drama mini-series Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story, and was portrayed by Canadian actor Don McKellar. The C.M. Fines Building is named in his honour.

This episode marks the directorial debut of Michael Dorn, who also played the character Worf on the show. \\"In the Cards\\" was written by Truly Barr Clark, Scott Neal, and Ronald D. Moore, and premiered on June 9, 1997.https://www.tor.com/2014/07/29/star-trek-deep-space- nine-rewatch-in-the-cards/ In addition to the regular Deep Space Nine cast, the episode features Louise Fletcher, Chase Masterson, Jeffrey Combs, and Aron Eisenberg in their recurring roles and a guest performance from Brian Markinson. In this episode, Jake Sisko and Nog try to acquire a baseball card, while running afoul of more serious political machinations. Plot The seeming inevitability of war with the Dominion has Deep Space Nine's command staff depressed, especially Captain Sisko. His son Jake learns that a 1951 Willie Mays rookie card will be for sale at Quark's upcoming auction and decides to buy it as a gift to cheer up his baseball-loving father. Jake enlists his friend Nog's help (and funds) to acquire the antique. The oddball Dr. Elias Giger buys the lot that includes the card. Giger offers to give the card to Jake in exchange for a strange assortment of equipment‚Äîmaterial to construct a \\"cellular regeneration and entertainment chamber\\", which Giger believes will grant immortality. Privately, the boys decide the man is crazy but agree to his offer, and obtain the required materials by doing various odd jobs for Chief O'Brien, Dr. Bashir, Major Kira and Lieutenant Commander Worf. To keep Jake's gift a surprise, they do not reveal the reason they want these items. Meanwhile, Bajoran spiritual leader Kai Winn is considering a proposed non-aggression pact between Bajor and the Dominion. She is torn, not wishing to align Bajor with the Dominion, but not trusting the Federation to make Bajor's defense a priority in the event of war. Captain Sisko recommends that Winn stall for time before committing herself to a decision. The Dominion negotiator, Weyoun, has guest quarters above Giger's, and is wary of the odd noises emanating from downstairs. Returning to Giger's quarters to deliver the requested equipment, Jake and Nog find the room empty with no sign of Giger. Jake confronts Winn and accuses her of kidnapping the doctor, earning a reprimand from Captain Sisko. Jake and Nog are unexpectedly beamed aboard Weyoun's ship: Weyoun, aware that the youths have been in contact with Giger, Winn, and the entirety of the station's senior staff, suspects they are up to something. Jake explains the scheme to obtain the card, but Weyoun seems incredulous, so Jake concocts a story that Willy Mays is a time-traveling saboteur he and Nog are investigating. Weyoun believes Jake's first story, deciding it was all innocent coincidence after all, and sends the boys away with the card. The episode ends with Captain Sisko reflecting on how his crew's moods have improved, over a montage illustrating how Jake and Nog's trades have helped them; the montage concludes with the captain hugging his son upon receiving the card. Reception In 2011, this episode was noted by Forbes as an episode that features bartering and an anti-aging technology. In 2019, CBR ranked \\"In the Cards\\" the 18th funniest episode of Star Trek.

Early life Samuel Doak was born August 1, 1749, in Augusta County, Virginia, to Scotch-Irish immigrants Samuel and Jane (Mitchell) Doak. He grew up on a frontier farm and began his education with Robert Alexander, who later founded the Academy of Liberty Hall (now Washington and Lee University). After attending an academy in Maryland, he entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton), from which he graduated two years later in 1775. Doak married Esther Houston Montgomery of Augusta County in October 1775. Career Doak taught at Hampden-Sydney College in the spring of 1776. There he studied theology under president Samuel Stanhope Smith, and completed his theological training in 1777 at Liberty Hall. He assumed his first pastorate in Abingdon, Virginia, and also began to \\"ride circuit\\" in eastern Tennessee. In 1778 Doak settled in Tennessee in Sullivan County and was ordained a Presbyterian minister. Moving to the Holston valley in Tennessee, Doak assumed the Presbytery's charge to serve the congregation of the Fork Church, now known as New Bethel Presbyterian Church. In 1780, Doak relocated from Sullivan County and to the western section Washington County near present-day Limestone, Tennessee, where he formed where he founded Salem Presbyterian Church, built a home, and constructed a school. Doak, during this same time in 1780, regularly preached to settlers at the Big Spring at Greeneville, Tennessee in present- day Greene County. Later in 1783, Mt. Bethel Presbyterian Church (now First Presbyterian Church) was formed with Hezekiah Balch being the first settled minister. The school that Doak had constructed at his Salem Presbyterian Church during 1780 was later chartered as St. Martin's Academy in 1783. St. Martin's Academy expanded in 1795 as Washington College. Doak served as president of Washington College (1795-1818) before turning it over to his oldest son, John Whitfield Doak. Esther Doak had died in 1807, and in 1818 he moved with his second wife, Margaretta Houston McEwen, to Tusculum Academy (later Tusculum College) and taught there with his son Samuel W. Doak until his death on December 12, 1830. He is buried at Salem Church. Doak was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree for his tireless efforts at promoting Presbyterianism and education. He was generally known as \\"the Presbyterian Bishop.\\" After becoming convinced of the iniquity of slavery, he freed his own slaves in 1818. Afterwards, for the rest of his life, Doak advocated immediate abolition. He was referred to as being \\"the apostle of learning and religion in the West.\\" 1780 prayer at Sycamore Shoals Doak is attributed with delivering the following lengthy sermon and prayer at Sycamore Shoals, September 26, 1780 to the mustering of the Patriot Overmountain Men prior to the Battle of Kings Mountain: :My countrymen, you are about to set out on an expedition which is full of hardships and dangers, but one in which the Almighty will attend you. The Mother Country has her hand upon you, these American colonies, and takes that for which our fathers planted their homes in the wilderness - OUR LIBERTY. Taxation without representation and the quartering of soldiers in the homes of our people without their consent are evidence that the crown of England would take from its American Subjects the last vestige of Freedom. Your brethren across the mountains are crying like Macedonia unto your help. God forbid that you should refuse to hear and answer their call - but the call of your brethren is not all. The enemy is marching hither to destroy your homes. Brave men, you are not unacquainted with battle. Your hands have already been taught to war and your fingers to fight. You have wrested these beautiful valleys of the Holston and Watauga from the savage hand. Will you tarry now until the other enemy carries fire and sword to your very doors? No, it shall not be. Go forth then in the strength of your manhood to the aid of your brethren, the defense of your liberty and the protection of your homes. And may the God of Justice be with you and give you victory. :Let us pray. Almighty and gracious God! Thou hast been the refuge and strength of Thy people in all ages. In time of sorest need we have learned to come to Thee - our Rock and our Fortress. Thou knowest the dangers and snares that surround us on march and in battle. Thou knowest the dangers that constantly threaten the humble, but well beloved homes, which Thy servants have left behind them. Oh, in Thine infinite mercy, save us from the cruel hand of the savage, and of tyrant. Save the unprotected homes while fathers and husbands and sons are far away fighting for freedom and helping the oppressed. Thou, who promised to protect the sparrow in its flight, keep ceaseless watch, by day and by night, over our loved ones. The helpless women and little children, we commit to Thy care. Thou wilt not leave them or forsake them in times of loneliness and anxiety and terror. Oh, God of Battle, arise in Thy might. Avenge the slaughter of Thy people. Confound those who plot for our destruction. Crown this mighty effort with victory, and smite those who exalt themselves against liberty and justice and truth. Help us as good soldiers to wield the SWORD OF THE LORD AND GIDEON. AMEN.Pat Alderman, \\"Samuel Doak's Famous Sermon and Prayer,\\" One Heroic Hour at King's Mountain (Overmountain Press, 1968), p. 21. The assembled Overmountain Men then later departed Sycamore Shoals (located in present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee and headed southeast over Roan Mountain and afterwards meeting up other Patriot frontiersmen to battle against Loyalist troops commanded by British Maj. Patrick Ferguson at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina.

She possessed a beautifully clear, steady voice with considerable flexibility in florid music. She was praised for her subtle phrasing and her dramatic gifts enabled her to create vivid individual portrayals. Although she sang a broad repertoire, she is particularly remembered for her association with the works of Benjamin Britten; notably singing roles created for her in the world premieres of several of his operas with the English Opera Group. On the concert stage, Vyvyan was highly active as an oratorio singer. The warmth and flexibility of her voice made her an outstanding exponent of the music of Purcell, Handel and other baroque composers. She frequently collaborated with the Royal Choral Society, often under conductor Malcolm Sargent, and sang countless performances of Messiah throughout Britain and abroad ‚Äì not least, with the Berlin Philharmonic. Biography Born in Broadstairs, England, Vyvyan entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1941 where she initially was a piano student. She was convinced by a faculty member to pursue a singing career and began her initial studies as a mezzo-soprano. During her last two and a half years at the conservatory she studied with Roy Henderson who trained her in the soprano repertoire. After graduating in 1947 she went to Milan for further studies and later studied privately with Fernando Carpi in Geneva in 1950. In 1951 she won the Geneva International Singing Competition. In 1948 Vyvyan became a member of Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group (EOG), making her professional debut with the company as Jenny Diver in the premi√®re of Britten's version of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. She appeared in several more roles with the organisation over the next two years, including Nancy in Albert Herring and the Female Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia. In 1951 she created the role of the Matron in the premiere of Brian Easdale's The Sleeping Children with the EOG in Cheltenham. In 1952 Vyvyan joined the roster of principal sopranos at the Sadler's Wells Opera, making a triumphant debut with the company as Konstanze in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. She returned to that house later in the season to portray Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. On 8 June 1953 she made her Royal Opera, London debut as Lady Penelope Rich in the world premiere of Britten's Gloriana, a production organised by the EOG. She sang in another EOG production for her debut at La Fenice on 14 September 1954; this time The Governess in the premiere of Britten's The Turn of the Screw. Vyvyan sang in many more world premieres during her career, including Tytania in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream (Aldeburgh Festival, 1960), the Countess de Serindan in Malcolm Williamson's The Violins of Saint-Jacques (1966, Sadler's Wells), various roles in Williamson's Lucky-Peter's Journey (1969, Sadler's Wells) and Mrs. Julian in Britten's Owen Wingrave (1971, BBC television). She also premiered Arthur Bliss's The Beatitudes in the 1962 festival for the opening of Coventry Cathedral, and gave the first UK performance of Britten's Cantata Academica in 1961 as well as the UK premiere of Poulenc's Les Mammelles de Tiresias (Aldeburgh 1958). Britten's spelling change to use Tytania in A Midsummer Night's Dream rather than Shakespeare's Titania was a tribute to Vyvyan. In 1953 Vyvyan portrayed Elettra in Idomeneo at the Glyndebourne Festival. Further opera performances and concerts took her to the stages of Milan, Rome, Munich, Vienna, Paris and Amsterdam. In 1955 she undertook a major tour of the Soviet Union as part of a delegation of British artists organised by Sir Arthur Bliss. In 1969 she performed at the Lucerne Festival. She remained a regular presence at the Royal Opera House as well during the 1950s and 1960s. On the concert stage, Vyvyan performed throughout Europe and the United States under such conductors as Carlo Maria Giulini, Leonard Bernstein, Rafael Kubelik, Pierre Monteux, Ernest Ansermet, Victor de Sabata, Josef Krips and Britten, excelling in performances of British music. She also appeared often on the radio and on television, including some of the earliest complete operas broadcast on British TV. She excelled in Handel and played a major role in the revival of his operas/oratorios ‚Äì with pioneering performances of Athalia, Samson, Amadigi, Rinaldo, Saul, and the first known staging in modern times of Radamisto (Sadlers Wells, 1960). She was also known for her interpretations of the soprano solos in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Britten's War Requiem, and Bach's St John Passion and St Matthew Passion. Having never retired, Vyvyan died from complications of a longstanding bronchial illness on 5 April 1974 at the age of 49. Recordings Jennifer Vyvyan's association with Benjamin Britten was perhaps one of the most fruitful periods in her career. Britten wrote four great roles specifically for Vyvyan's voice and style: Penelope Rich (Gloriana) The Governess (The Turn of The Screw) Tytania (A Midsummer Night's Dream) and Mrs. Julian (Owen Wingrave). Vyvyan can be heard on recordings of Britten's The Turn of the Screw, The Little Sweep, Owen Wingrave, Cantata Academica and Spring Symphony. Her strange and elegant Tytania can now be heard in an original cast recording of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream on Testament records, her Lady Rich, called by John Steane \\"a remarkable study in edgy pride\\" can be found on Music Preserved and her deliciously neurotic Mrs. Julian can be heard on Decca. Vyvyan is also featured in Britten's realizations of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen and Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Her Handel recordings include Semele, Saul, and two separate recordings of Messiah; one with conductor Sir Adrian Boult and the other under the baton of Sir Thomas Beecham. She also collaborated with Beecham and the Royal Choral Society on a recording of Beethoven's Mass in C with fellow singers Monica Sinclair and Marian Nowakowski. Her recital records include \\"Songs of England\\" with Ernest Lush, piano, Mozart arias conducted by Peter Maag, Scarlatti cantatas with Elsie Morison, and Haydn and Mozart concert arias conducted by Harry Newstone.

The University of Georgia Press. 456 p. Weakley, Alan S. 2008 (working draft). Flora of Carolinas, Virginia, Georgia, northern Florida, and surrounding areas. University of North Carolina Herbarium. Its common names reflect the ashy or gray appearance of the undersides of its leaves, which results from a dense pubescence. Range and habitat Ashy hydrangea occurs scattered in mostly upland sites and rocky outcrops in the interior regions of the southeastern United States in the southern sections of the Blue Ridge Mountains from Tennessee to South Carolina, west to Missouri, south to Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia. It is typically found in neutral, basic or calcareous soils. Taxonomy Ashy hydrangea is similar to the more widespread smooth hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens) and the restricted silverleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea radiata). At one time both ashy hydrangea and silverleaf hydrangea were considered subspecies of smooth hydrangea.McClintock, E. 1957. A monograph of the genus Hydrangea. Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences 29: 147‚Äì256. However, most taxonomist now consider them to be separate species, and that usage is adopted here.Pilatowski, Ronald E. A taxonomic study of the Hydrangea arborescens complex. Castanea 47: 84‚Äì98. Description The inflorescence of ashy hydrangea is a corymb. The showy, sterile flowers (white to near white) are few (0‚Äì3 per flowerhead) and are borne around the periphery of the corymb; they are usually greater than 1 cm in diameter. Flowering occurs in late spring or early summer. The leaves of ashy hydrangea are large (8 to 15 cm long), opposite, serrated, ovate, and deciduous. Lower leaf surfaces are variously pubescent, appearing gray; the trichomes are usually not dense enough to entirely mask the green leaf surface; as seen under magnification, the trichomes have prominent tubercles (bumps). Uses This attractive native shrub is often cultivated for ornamental use.Dirr, Michael A. hydrangeas for American gardens. Timber Press. 240 p. Ashy hydrangea is more tolerant of heat and drought than silverleaf hydrangea. Several popular cultivars (Frosty, Pink Pin Cushion, and Sterilis) are available that have a greater component of showy, sterile flowers. The plant is used medicinally by the Cherokee. An infusion of the bark scrapings is taken for vomiting bile, and an infusion of the roots is taken as a cathartic and emetic by women during menses.Taylor, Linda Averill 1940 Plants Used As Curatives by Certain Southeastern Tribes. Cambridge, MA. Botanical Museum of Harvard University (p. 25) Ashy hydrangea was probably used medicinally in a similar manner as smooth hydrangea by the Cherokee Indians, and later, by early settlers for treatment of kidney and bladder stones.Mrs. M.

Its local government area is the City of Moonee Valley. At the , Travancore had a population of 2,480. The suburb is located between the Tullamarine Freeway and Mount Alexander Road, south of Ormond Road, although the northernmost section of the area is still incorrectly referred to as Ascot Vale. Travancore was initially supposed to encompass the entirety of the area flanked by Ormond and Mount Alexander Roads and the Tullamarine Freeway. The Moonee Valley City Council has taken steps to bring the remainder of the proposed area of Travancore into the suburb. That will reflect what was originally intended and, in turn, will reduce the area of the suburb of Ascot Vale. Travancore takes its name from the Travancore Mansion and Estate, a property in the area owned by Henry Madden. Madden purchased the property, previously Flemington House, from the relatives of Hugh Glass in 1906, and renamed it. Madden exported horses to India, hence the property being named after the former southern Indian kingdom of Travancore, now part of the Indian state of Kerala. When the land around Travancore Mansion was sub-divided, many of the streets were named in keeping with the Indian theme, such as Baroda Street, Lucknow Street, Bengal Street, Cashmere Street and Mangalore Street. Some of the houses reflect the Old English architecture of the former Travancore region of India. Travancore Mansion was purchased by the Victorian Government and became a special education school. The building was demolished in the 1940s, and the area is now occupied by the Travancore campus of Royal Children's Hospital Mental Health. The Flemington Primary School has the ornate gates that once belonged to the Travancore Mansion. The Flemington Tram Depot, located on Mount Alexander Road, Travancore, is on the Victorian Heritage Register. Travancore, only 5 km from Melbourne's CBD, has seen a transformation in recent years, following a fire that destroyed the Lombard Paper Factory. The former factory site is now occupied by residential towers that flank the suburb on its southern side.

Oshibori have long been part of hospitality culture in Japan: in the Tale of Genji era, it was used for visitors; during the Edo period it was used in hatago; later, it started to be used in many restaurants.Êù±Êó•Êú¨„Åä„Åó„Åº„ÇäÂÖ±ÂêåÁµÑÂêà (East Japan Oshibori Cooperative Association) It eventually spread to worldwide use. Cold oshibori are used in summer, and hot oshibori in winter. In Japan, October 29 has been observed as the day of oshibori since 2004.ÂÖ®ÂõΩ„Åä„Åó„Åº„ÇäÂÖ±ÂêåÁµÑÂêàÈÄ£Âêà‰ºö (National Oshibori Cooperative Association) Etymology The word oshibori comes from the Japanese verb , meaning \\"to wring\\", with the honorific prefix o-. In Japanese script, the word oshibori is normally written in hiragana (), and seldom using kanji ( or ). Oshibori are also known as o-tefuki; tefuki refers to ordinary handkerchiefs, and these derive from the Japanese (hand) and , to wipe. In mah-jong parlors, the words atsushibo and tsumeshibo, from the Japanese adjectives , hot, and , cold, are sometimes used to refer to hot and cold oshibori respectively. Typical oshibori JR express train, Japan A typical oshibori, made of cloth, is dampened with water and wrung. It is then placed on the dining table for customers to wipe their hands before or during the meal. The oshibori is often rolled or folded and given to the customer on some kind of tray. Even if a tray is not used, it is usually rolled up into a long, thin shape, although this is not necessarily the case with oshibori provided with, say, bento lunch boxes. Many establishments also give out towels made of non-woven cloth or paper, which are generally used once and then disposed of. Paper ones sometimes contain a sterilizing agent such as alcohol or stabilized chlorine dioxide. Paper oshibori, unlike cloth oshibori, can be folded and put into a very thin plastic wrapping for inclusion with packaged products such as bento lunch boxes in convenience stores. Hot and cold oshibori An oshibori can be moistened with hot water at an appropriate temperature or steam to make a hot oshibori, or placed damp into a refrigerator to make a cold oshibori suitable for use in summer. Restaurants usually use an electric appliance such as a heating cabinet or refrigerator for this. Rented oshibori As many establishments use oshibori in large quantities, they often do not prepare them in the store, but instead employ a rental service which launders them, rolls them into the typical cylindrical shape, and delivers them already damp. These rental service companies frequently wrap each oshibori individually in a clear, lightweight plastic seal (polyethylene film), which can be easily broken and removed by the customer before using. Oshibori dispensers Some beauty salons and dental clinics prefer to use a standalone oshibori dispenser, with which a freshly made towel is prepared at the client's request. In this case, the towels are often made of a non-woven fiber. Around the world Small hot towels are often distributed to airline business class passengers. Disposable towels seen here prior to preparation. Oshibori is usually translated as \\"hot towel\\". Most airlines distribute hot towels to international first and business class passengers prior to the first meal on long haul flights. The heated towel used in barber's shops to moisturize the skin or beard and make it easier to shave can also be thought of as a type of oshibori.

His football club career was with the St George Dragons and the merged St George Illawarra Dragons - he captained both sides. He played principally at but sometimes as a in his notable representative career. He was also the brother of another first grade footballer, Peter Coyne. In an era when players also worked while playing Coyne had already spent ten years working in the Financial Industry utilizing his marketing degree before retiring from the NRL in 1999. Upon retirement he moved into the insurance industry focussing on personal injury claims management. His knowledge and experience led him to senior roles within the industry, including Executive General Manager of GIO‚Äôs national workers compensation claims operations and Executive/Managing Director of Coal Services Pty Ltd, a specialist workers compensation insurance scheme for the coal mining industry. In 2012 Mark commenced as Chief Executive of EML after joining the organisation two years earlier. Under Mark‚Äôs leadership, EML has seen strong growth over the past six years with the business doubling in size. Mark has a degree in Business Management, was a Director of NRMA Road Service and a Director of the Police and Citizens Youth Club for a decade. He remains committed to charity work as a Board Member of the Sporting Chance Cancer Foundation and is a Benefactor of the NSW Children‚Äôs Cancer Institute. Club career A Queenslander, Coyne was graded with the Brothers club in Brisbane, playing in the 1987 Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final and scoring a try. He then relocated to the St George Dragons in Sydney in 1988. He made his first grade debut in 1989 and impressed with his trademark right foot step. In Round 14 of the 1991 season, Coyne became the first player to score a try on the famous Adelaide Oval in the first NSWRL premiership match played in South Australia. On a cold and wet night in June, the Dragons defeated the Balmain Tigers 16-2 in front of 28,884 fans, the largest attendance of the 1991 minor round. In 1992 Coyne played in the Dragons 28-8 Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. Coyne played in the 1993 Grand Final for the Dragons where once again they went down to the Broncos 14-6. 1994 saw Coyne take on the role as captain of St George, a year when the Dragons failed to make the finals. Coyne's leadership capabilities were fully acknowledged in 1995 when he was captain of St George, Vice Captain of Queensland and made his Test debut for the Kangaroos. In 1996 Coyne lead the Dragons to another Grand Final, but despite playing a great game himself the Dragons went down controversially to the Manly Sea Eagles 20-8. In 1998 Coyne was honoured with a testimonial year at St George and impressively, he chose to donate all the proceeds ($135,000) of that testimonial season to a children's charity. Coyne retired in 1999, whilst playing for the St George Illawarra Dragons and after 12 seasons wearing the Dragons' Big Red V. By the end of his career he had played in 9 Test matches; 19 Origins and more than 200 first grade matches, of which more than 100 were as captain. Representative career Coyne made his State of Origin debut in game II of 1990 for Queensland, after impressive performances in the centres for his club. Mark had to bide his time and wait another two years before being selected for Queensland in games II and III of 1992. In game II that year Coyne popped up a great pass to send Billy Moore over for a try. Queensland went on to win the match 5-4. In 1993 Coyne played in all three games and set up a try for Mal Meninga in game II. But 1994 would ultimately provide the most memorable of Coyne's State of Origin appearances and enabled his entry to the annals of Maroon and Origin folklore. In game I, with Queensland down 12-10 and 40 seconds left on the clock, from deep in their own half the Maroons started one of the most memorable try-scoring movements. Allan Langer handled the ball twice in the 11-pass sequence which was finished when Coyne extended his arm in the right corner to thwart the last ditched defensive efforts of Brad Fittler and Ricky Stuart, breaking Blues' hearts in the process and winning the match in a heart-stopping finish.Mark Coyne's miracle try for Qld Although NSW went on to win the series 2-1, Channel 9 television commentator Ray \\"Rabbits\\" Warren famously stated in his call of the try \\"That's not a try that's a miracle\\". Unfortunately for Coyne, St George suffered a severe downturn in form during the second half of the 1994 NSWRL season, though his own form was still good and he was considered unlucky to miss selection for the successful 1994 Kangaroo tour. Loyal to the ARL during the Super League war Coyne was one of a handful of senior Queensland players available for representative honours that year and along with Trevor Gillmeister and Dale Shearer he brought experience and spirit to the young Queensland side and their novice coach Paul Vautin. History shows that Queensland won the 1995 Origin series 3-nil. Before the 1995 series, Vautin's relatively inexperienced Qld team were not even rated a chance of winning a game against a NSW team that had won the previous 3 Origin series, were coached by Phil Gould and could boast test players Brad Fittler, Tim Brasher, Rod Wishart, Paul McGregor, Greg Florimo, Mark Carroll, Brad Mackay, Geoff Toovey, and future stars Andrew Johns and Steve Menzies His ARL loyalty was repaid when he made his Australian representative debut in the 1995 Trans- Tasman Test series against New Zealand and he played in the first two Tests of the series, only missing the final test at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane through injury. The ARL only Kangaroos defeated the Kiwis 3-nill. Later that year he was selected in Australia's 1995 Rugby League World Cup squad, played in two pool games (including losing the opening game of the tournament to England at Wembley Stadium, London where he scored his first test try), the 30-20 extra- time semi-final win against New Zealand, and was a member of side that won the final against England 16-8 at Wembley Stadium, London. He was a mainstay of Australian representative sides during the schismatic years of Super League and made further representative appearances against Papua New Guinea, Fiji and a Rest of the World side in 1997. Career statistics 207 games for St. George 15 games for St. George Illawarra 19 games for Queensland (State of Origin) 9 games for the Australian Kangaroos 3 Grand Final appearances: 1992, 1993, 1996 (missed the 1999 Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm due to injury) Later years Between 2003 and 2009 Mark held various positions within GIO Insurance, culminating in his appointment in 2007 as Executive General Manager of their national workers compensation claims business. Mark has previously held the position of Chief Executive/Managing Director of Coal Services Pty Ltd (February 2010 ‚Äì December 2011), a specialist workers compensation insurance scheme for the coal mining industry. Mark became CEO of EML (Employers Mutual Limited), a workers compensation claims management mutual in 2012, a post he holds to this day. Mark was an NRL Judiciary Panel Member (2008-2014), NRL & Independent Chairman of RLPA Education & Welfare Committee for seven years from 2006 to 2014. Mark was a Director of Police and Citizens Youth Club from 2002 to 2012 and a Director of the NRMA Road Service between 2000 and 2003. Mark is currently a Benefactor of the NSW Children's Cancer Institute and a board member of the Sporting Chance Cancer Foundation. On 28 February 2019 Mark was appointed as an Australian Rugby League (ARL) Commissioner. On 17 July, Coyne stood down as an ARLC commissioner following an incident in Singapore. Coyne returned to Australia after he pleaded guilty to the charge of abusing an officer and was fined $4,000.

Originally a rural area, the neighbourhood is named after a hotel which stood beside a shop on the corner of Blackburn Road and Highbury Road during the 1870s and 1880s. Opposite the hotel a primitive racecourse was constructed, and although the roads were considered in poor repair, activities there attracted large crowds.

After emerging from the role of a right-handed specialist to primary setup pitcher for closer Trevor Rosenthal, Neshek made his first All-Star Game. In 43 games and IP before the midseason break, he was 4‚Äì0 with two saves, a 0.70 ERA, and 0.57 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). By making the team, he became just the 15th non-starter or closer of 280 total pitchers of the prior ten seasons to be named to an All-Star team. Further, the All-Star selection was a personal landmark event in two ways. First, the game was played at Target Field in Minneapolis, the home field of the Twins, the team with whom Neshek began his MLB career. Second, it was close to Brooklyn Park, the city in which he grew up. However, Neshek took the loss for the National League, as the American League won, 5‚Äì3. The Cardinals traded for John Lackey at the non-waiver deadline on July 31, and Neshek volunteered to change his number from 41 to 37. Lackey had worn 41 with past teams. To facilitate the exchange, Lackey mailed Neshek a Babe Ruth-autographed baseball the next month. In an August 10 appearance against the Orioles, Neshek's sinker was clocked at as he completed two innings and struck out four, tying a career high. On August 19 against the Cincinnati Reds, he worked the last inning and picked up the decision in a Cardinals' walk-off win. It was his sixth win of the year against zero losses. For the month, he registered two saves and two wins. In 2014 he was 7‚Äì2 with six saves and a 1.87 ERA, and 68 strikeouts in 67 innings.Pat Neshek Stats  Baseball-Reference.com Despite having only given up 4 home runs the entire season, Neshek surrendered a postseason game-losing home run in Game 2 of the 2014 National League Division Series to Matt Kemp of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the game-tying home run in Game 5 of the 2014 National League Championship Series to Michael Morse of the San Francisco Giants, which ultimately lead to the elimination of the Cardinals in the 2014 postseason. =Houston Astros= On December 10, 2014, Neshek agreed to a two- year, $12.5MM contract with the Houston Astros.

He was the 4th-oldest player in the National League. Pitching style Neshek in 2015 Neshek has a very unorthodox style of delivery that transitions from starting at a submarine angle to finishing sidearm with an explosive thrusting motion. Near the release of the pitch, his torso and arm angle in a moderate \\"V\\" shape. He developed the delivery after being struck in the forearm with a ball in high school by C. J. Woodrow (a former Philadelphia Phillies farmhand). He then began to throw sidearm and play shortstop due to his injury. When it healed, he could not change back to over the shoulder and his unique delivery stayed the way it is. He still has a lump in his forearm where he was struck. The delivery has earned mention on SportsCenter as well as Baseball Tonight. Professional baseball scouts have had a divided opinion on the issue. Some were worried that this violent-looking delivery would lead to arm problems. Others considered the delivery to be an asset, as right- handed batters have a very difficult time seeing the ball. For example, Jos√© Marz√°n, his former manager with the Single-A Fort Myers Miracle, believes that one of Neshek's greatest strengths is his ability to have enough strength to throw hard from such an angle, as his fastball used to top out around prior to his Tommy John surgery. Neshek has had great success in both the minor and major leagues as a reliever, averaging more than a strikeout per inning pitched. After joining the Cardinals in 2014, Neshek's sinking fastball showed effectiveness well-above expectations through May 21. With a mean movement of 10.9 inches, it averaged more horizontal movement than any other pitch from any other reliever on the Cardinals staff, which was 1.3 inches more than Carlos Mart√≠nez' two-seam fastball. Mart√≠nez' own fastball has been heralded for its movement. Neshek's sinking fastball also averaged over during that time, its highest velocity since 2007. Personal life After the 2007 season Neshek became a vegan. An avid autograph collector, Neshek has created and runs his own website for his fans to interact and talk about collecting autographs.

It is located approximately offshore from Tillamook Head, and south of the mouth of the Columbia River, situated on less than an acre of basalt rock in the Pacific Ocean. The construction of the lighthouse was commissioned in 1878 by the United States Congress, and began in 1880. The construction took more than 500 days to finish, with its completion in January 1881. In early January 1881, when the lighthouse was near completion, the barque Lupatia was wrecked near the rock during inclement weather and sank, killing all 16 crew members. The Light was officially lit on January 21, 1881. At the time, it was the most expensive West Coast lighthouse ever built. Due to the erratic weather conditions, and the dangerous commute for both keepers and suppliers, the lighthouse was nicknamed \\"Terrible Tilly\\" (or Tillie). Over the years, storms have damaged the lighthouse, shattered the lens, and eroded the rock. It was decommissioned in 1957, and has since been sold to private owners. Until its license was revoked in 1999, it functioned as a columbarium, and today remains privately owned. The light is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and is part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. It is visible from the coastal cities of Seaside, Cannon Beach, as well as from Ecola State Park. Construction In 1878, the United States Congress appropriated $50,000 for a lighthouse to be built on Tillamook Head;Annual Report 1878, p. 100 however, after a survey was conducted, it was determined that due to the approximately height of the Head, the light would be obstructed by fog, and the Tillamook rock was selected as the alternative site for the construction. A survey of the rock was ordered in 1879, which was headed by H. S. Wheeler and his cutter Thomas Corwin. Wheeler's initial assessment determined that access to the rock was severely limited, if not impossible, but was ordered to continue. During his second assessment, he was able to land on the rock, but was unable to move his survey equipment without the use of a tape line. He then relayed that the rock would need considerable blasting to create a level area in order lay down a foundation for the lighthouse, and that more money was going to be needed to complete the project. Illustration of the lighthouse under construction In September 1879, a third survey was ordered, this time headed by John Trewavas, whose experience included the Wolf Rock lighthouse in England. Trewavas was overtaken by large swells and was swept into the sea while attempting a landing, and his body was never recovered. His replacement, Charles A. Ballantyne, had a difficult assignment recruiting workers due to the widespread negative reaction to Trewavas' death, and a general desire by the public to end the project. Ballantyne was eventually able to secure a group of quarrymen who knew nothing of the tragedy, and was able to resume work on the rock. Transportation to and from the rock involved the use of a derrick line attached with a breeches buoy, and in May 1880, they were able to completely blast the top of the rock to allow the construction of the lighthouse's foundation. The structure of lighthouse included an attached keeper's quarters and a tower that originally housed a first-order Fresnel lens, with an incandescent oil vapor lamp, above sea level. The light had a visibility range of , and was fixed with a steam foghorn. It is located on less than an acre of basalt in the Pacific Ocean, south of the Columbia River, approximately off Tillamook Head, and is the northernmost lighthouse along the Oregon coast. The construction lasted more than 500 days by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the leadership of George Lewis Gillespie, Jr. The cost of $125,000, at the time (equivalent to $ today), was the most expensive West Coast lighthouse ever built, later surpassed by the St. George Reef Light off the northern California coast. =The wreck of the Lupatia= In early January 1881, when the lighthouse was near completion, the barque Lupatia was sailing in thick fog and high winds when the ship's Captain noticed that they were too close to shore. Wheeler, the official in charge of the lighthouse's construction, heard the voices of the panicked crew and immediately ordered his men to place lanterns in the tower, and light a bonfire to signal the ship that they were approximately from the rock. The ship appeared to have been able to turn itself toward returning to sea, however quickly disappeared into the fog, and Wheeler was not able to hear the crew. The next day, the bodies of all 16 crew members were found washed up on shore of Tillamook Head. The only survivor of the wreck was the crew's dog. Operational era The tower was first lit on January 21, 1881, and was assigned with four keepers. Duty at the Tillamook Light was considered difficult due to the isolation from civilization, and the severe weather conditions. The light was nicknamed \\"Terrible Tilly\\" (or Tillie), for the stormy conditions of its location. Throughout its history, the area was hit by large, violent storms that damaged the lighthouse with large waves, winds, and debris, and on several occasions, the tower was flooded after the lantern room windows were broken by large debris. The lighthouse had four head keepers during its first two years and in 1897, a telephone line was installed, though a storm cut it shortly afterwards. During a storm in 1912, 100 tons of rock were reportedly shorn off the western end of the rock, and the windows were gradually cemented over, replaced by small portholes. On October 21, 1934, the original lens was destroyed by a large storm that also leveled parts of the tower railing and greatly damaged the landing platform. Winds had reached , launching boulders and debris into the tower, damaging the lantern room and destroying the lens. The derrick and phone lines were destroyed as well. After the storm subsided, communication with the lighthouse was severed until keeper Henry Jenkins built a makeshift radio from the damaged foghorn and telephone to alert officials. Diesel engines were installed to provide electricity for the light and station.Gibbs, pp. 193‚Äì195 Repairs to the lighthouse cost $12,000 and were not fully completed until February 1935. The Fresnel lens was replaced by an aerobeacon, and a metal mesh placed around the lantern room to protect the tower from large boulders. Post-operational era The lighthouse was shut down in 1957 and replaced with a whistle buoy, having become the most expensive U.S. lighthouse to operate. The last keeper was Oswald Allik, who would later become the last head keeper of Heceta Head Light. Within two years, the lighthouse was sold to a group of investors from Nevada, who sold it in 1980 to a group of realtors, who created the Eternity at Sea Columbarium, which opened in June of that year. After interring about 30 urns, the columbarium's license was revoked in 1999 by the Oregon Mortuary and Cemetery Board and was rejected upon reapplication in 2005. Access to the lighthouse is severely limited, with a helicopter landing the only practical way to access the rock, and it is off-limits even to the owners during the seabird nesting season. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and is part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge.

It is a part of T√≥rshavn Municipality and is considered among the oldest settlements in the islands. There are two schools and one kindergarten in the village, with children coming from the neighboring village of Kirkjub√∏ as well the capital at T√≥rshavn. Geography Velbasta√∞ur is on Streymoy‚Äôs west coast in the south of the island, about five kilometres from Kirkjub√∏ur. It has a beautiful view across the strait of Hestsfj√∏r√∞ur towards the islands of Hestur and Koltur. The islands of V√°gar and Mykines can be seen further to the west, and Sandoy further to the south. History Faroe stamp featuring Velbasta√∞ur Archaeological finds have unearthed artifacts possible dating as far back as the Viking age, but most locations used in those times have washed into the sea now. Velbasta√∞ur is located nearly in the center of the archipelago, and close to the old Thing in T√≥rshavn across the mountain. This would support the idea that there has been a shrine at Velbasta√∞ur. T√≥rshavn means the harbor of Thor. It was a natural harbor and would be a good place for travelers to land their ships and boats, and complete the travel overland, if conditions on the southwestern coast were disagreeable. The location of Kirkjub√∏, only 5 km to the south east on the same coast, supports the notion that there was a heathen shrine at Velbasta√∞. The early Christian church would often locate their headquarters as close as possible to sacred heathen locations, making it easier to subdue and convert the most hardcore supporters of the old faiths. The village was deserted for some time after the Black Death in 1349. The population of the village has increased in recent years from 134 in 1990, to 220 in 2015, mainly due to its close proximity to the capital T√≥rshavn, while still preserving the feeling of living in the countryside. = Name origin = The place name Velbasta√∞ur is unique in the Faroes as it is the only settlement with the ending sta√∞ur, meaning place or location. The name is by many considered the same as the Old Norse V√©b√≥lsta√∞r, meaning farm with a V√© or shrine. V√© (from the Old Norse) was a type of sacred enclosure or a sanctuary. Locations with similar prefixes of Ve and histories of sacred locations, can be found several places in Norway, such as Vebbestad in Kv√¶stad, Troms or Veibust, in Sula, M√∏re og Romsdal.

It is an important commercial, transportation and administrative hub for the Pochutla District in the east of the Costa Region. Pochutla is located at the junction of coastal Highway 200 and Highway 175 to Oaxaca, with 175 functioning as the town's main thoroughfare. Its name means \\"place of kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra)\\", and most of the city is built on a lakebed which was drained during the colonial period. The municipality is best known as being the home of the oceanside communities of Puerto √Ångel and Zipolite. History The Pochutla area was settled by Zapotec tribes from Amatl√°n, Miahuatl√°n and Cuatlan in the 8th century. The settlement now known as Pochutla was founded around the same time as nearby Loxicha, Cozoaltepec and others. The area was part of the dominion of Tututepec. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Spanish town of Pochutla was founded by Pedro Molina, Isidro Salinas, Julio Diaz and others, initially with the name of Huehuetan. The locals were converted to Christianity and the first church was founded just south of the modern town and called San Pedro Huehuet√°n Laguna. Much of the modern city is built on what was a lakebed. Because of illnesses such as malaria and yellow fever, this lake was drained. Later in the colonial period, the name was changed to Pochutla due to the number of kapok trees in the area. According to tradition and archeological evidence located in the hills of Vig√≠a, Espino and El Cometa, there were arms hidden here by pirates, who were called Pichiling√ºes. In 1833, Conservative rebels led by General Valent√≠n Canalizo fled through here as they were pursued by government troops. Their last battle was at the nearby Soledad Ranch in which they were destroyed by federal forces, forcing the remaining soldiers to scatter. Conservative rebels continued to be active in this region until the 1860s with Jos√© Eustaquio Manzano and Apolonio Manzano leading the rebel cause, reinvigorated due to the passage of the Reform Laws. In 1858 and 1859, federal forces were dispatched here to subdue the rebels who had taken to guerrilla warfare. The last battle between the Manzano brothers and federal troops took place in 1860, with the brothers captured and taken to the state capital in 1861. The municipality has a petroleum reserve called Arag√≥n, five km from the community of Puerto Angel. The deposit was going to be exploited by an English company, who brought over equipment in 1937, but expropriation of oil in 1938 by President L√°zaro C√°rdenas brought this to a halt. It has yet to be tapped. Until late in the 20th century, much of the population of the area lived on subsistence farming, with the only work available during the harvest season on the coffee plantations. In the 1970, the state government expropriated most of the coastal land from Zipolite to Zapotengo and made it ejido or communal land with the aim of development. During the 2006 teachers strike in the state of Oaxaca, groups supporting and opposing the strike clashed here on the main road, Highway 175. The highway was blocked by those supporting the strike to prevent those opposing it from realizing their ‚ÄúMarch for Education.‚Äù The highway was blocked with busses and cars preventing those bound for the state capital from leaving. Other recent strikes include those by taxi drivers and others in transportation who have blocked roads resulting in monetary losses for the municipality. The dispute centered on concessions for passenger transportation between Pochutla and beach communities such as Zipolite. Actions by strikers have included the blockage of roads including coastal Highway 200. The city Municipal Palace The city is the commercial, transportation and administrative center for the area. It contains banks, supermarkets and specialty stores that serve the coastal and isolated mountain communities of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca which generally lack these things. The city is on the crossroads of Highway 175, which connects Oaxaca city with Puerto Angel and coastal Highway 200 that connects communities such as Puerto Angel, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, Huatulco and Salina Cruz. It is a transportation hub filled with buses, taxis and dust. Taxis called ‚Äúcolectivos‚Äù (collectives) go to the area's beaches as well as pickup trucks fitted to carry passengers. There are two bus stations with first and second class buses to Oaxaca city, Mexico City and Huatulco. It is not a tourist attraction but it serves tourists as a place for banking services and supplies not available in the beach communities as well as a transfer point for buses. In the evening, the main road through town has a variety of street food. The parish church was begun in 1840 but was not finished until 1957. The municipal palace was built in 1873. The center, especially the main plaza and the municipal palace, has recently been renovated and a new amphitheatre has been built to host cultural and sporting events. The patron saint's day is 29 June in which people celebrate with masks, and fireworks, some set in frames called ‚Äúcastles.‚Äù Pochutla gained the title of city in March 2003. It is the seat of the Pochutla District, and is also the head of the Parish of Pochutla which oversees 39 other communities. The municipality View of Puerto Angel's wharf As municipal seat, the city of San Pedro Pochutla is the governing authority over 238 other named communities, with a total area of 421km2. This municipality has a total population of 38,798 of with 12,117 live in the city proper. The most important communities other than the seat include Puerto Angel and Zipolite, both of which are oceanside communities. Zipolite is a popular tourist attraction and Puerto Angel was a coffee export port whose economy now is based on tourism and fishing. Other beaches include La Mina, where waves crash noisily against rocks and Zapotengo with has miles of coconut groves next to the sand. There is also a fresh water spring in San Jos√© Chacalapa. The municipality borders Candelaria Loxicha, Pluma Hidalgo, Santa Mar√≠a Huatulco, Cozoaltepec and Santo Domingo with the Pacific Ocean to the south. The climate here is hot and humid due to its proximity to the ocean with a rainy season in the summer. Average temperatures vary between 30 and 38C. The south of the municipality is oceanfront and the north is formed by mountains of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca. Various rivers pass through here on their way to the Pacific Ocean even more arroyos filling during the summer rainy season. Most of the rain falls in the mountains areas of the municipality rather than on the coast. Principal elevations include Vigia and Espino from which the main river flows. Despite the drainage of the principal lake, malaria is still a concern here. Vegetation is of the tropical and sub- tropical types and include a number of valuable tropical wood trees such as huanacastle, mahogany, cedar and Guaiacum coulteri, which are primarily used to make furniture. Common wildlife includes iguanas, deer, wild boar, armadillos, rabbits, raccoons and numerous birds native to the area. Coastal species include black coral, turtles sea bass, sharks and crabs, with bass, mojarra and shrimp found in the rivers. The principal cultivated crop here is coffee, which provides most of the employment of the rural population. This is raised in the mountain areas. Second is the raising of coconuts and products based on it such as coconut oil. Another important crop is mangos. Other crops grown include corn, sesame seed, peanuts, limes, plums, bananas, watermelons and other melons. About 50% of the total population is dedicated to commerce, especially that related to tourism. About 22% is dedicated to mining, petroleum, and industry. A number of traditions are maintained, mostly in the rural areas. In rural communities, various dialects of the Zapotec language are still spoken. Crafts include figures carved from coconuts, in the regional penitentiary are made necklaces and figures from black coral, wood and other materials. Traditional dress until recently consisted of loose fitting white pants and shirts made of lightweight canvas but this has mostly given way to modern clothing especially in the city. However, older women can still be seen in canvas blouses, rebozos, sandals and wearing long braids. Local specialties include iguana tamales and venison in yellow or red mole. Traditional music includes songs called ‚Äúsones‚Äù and chilenas. Local ‚Äúsones‚Äù include titles such as El Perro, El Arriero, El Borracho, El Zopilote, El Toro and El Panadero. Dance garb for women includes long, wide skirts and blouses in various bright colors adorned with ribbons and with the blouses embroidered with flowers. Accessories include rebozos, sandals and palm-leaf hats. The men wear white pants and shirts with sandals and palm-leaf hats. Most of the dances have themes relating to flirting and falling in love. A dance called the ‚ÄúKirio‚Äù is performed at weddings.

The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is based on the 1934 play of the same title by Lillian Hellman. The film stars Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, and James Garner. Plot Former college classmates Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine) and Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) open a private school for girls. Martha's Aunt Lily (Miriam Hopkins), an aging actress, lives and teaches elocution at the school. After an engagement of two years to Joe Cardin (James Garner), a reputable obstetrician, Karen finally agrees to set a wedding date. Joe is related to the influential Amelia Tilford (Fay Bainter), whose granddaughter Mary (Karen Balkin) is a student at the school. Mary is a spoiled, conniving child who bullies her classmates, particularly Rosalie Wells (Veronica Cartwright), whom she blackmails when she discovers her in possession of a student's missing bracelet. When Mary is caught in a lie, Karen punishes her by refusing to let her attend the weekend's boat races. Mary goes home to her grandmother and twists a story so that she will not have to return to school that day. Karen learns what the story is from a father of a departing student and confronts Amelia about Mary accusing Martha and Karen of being lovers. Mary is foiled at convincing others that she personally saw the interactions between Martha and Karen. Mary coerces Rosalie to corroborate her story. Joe is frustrated by the situation, saying that he has finished cleaning up his grandmother's home, and maintains his engagement to Karen and his friendship with Martha. The two women intend to file a suit of libel and slander against Mrs. Tilford. Martha and Karen are isolated at the school. Aunt Lily returns after the suit has been lost because she would not return to testify on behalf of her niece and Karen. The incident had been circulated widely by the media. Joe wants to continue with his intention to marry Karen and wants Martha to restart life with them in a rural area where he has found a practice. Karen insists that Joe tell her whether he believes that there was a relationship between Martha and Karen. Joe hesitates before telling Karen that he believes it's untrue. She then says that nothing ever happened and that she could not continue with the engagement knowing that he doubted her. Rosalie's mother (Sally Brophy) discovers a cache of items among her daughter's belongings, including the bracelet inscribed to Helen Burton. Mrs. Wells takes her daughter to Mrs. Tilford who, while walking over to meet her granddaughter, Mary, on the stairs collapses on the floor. Karen tells Martha that Joe will not come back. Martha is distraught at Karen's cryptic explanation and urges her to not let Joe go. Karen, however, wants to leave town with Martha the next day. She believes they can go where they will not be recognized and can start a new life, but Martha does not. As Martha tries to talk herself into believing she and Karen are just good friends, she realizes that she does truly love Karen. While Karen does not believe her, tries to dissuade her and maintains her own heterosexuality, Martha comes to believe she has loved Karen ever since they met and that she was simply unaware of the true nature of her feelings. Despite Karen's assurances to the contrary, Martha feels responsible for ruining both their lives and is appalled by her feelings towards Karen. Mrs. Tilford visits the two teachers. She has learned about the falsehood perpetrated by her; the court proceedings will be reversed and the award for damages settled. Karen refuses Mrs. Tilford's gesture. Martha no longer wants to continue with the conversation. Karen leaves her for a walk on the school grounds. Aunt Lily asks Karen about the whereabouts of Martha as her door is locked. Karen breaks loose the door's slide lock with a candleholder and discovers Martha has hanged herself in her room. After Martha's funeral, Karen walks away alone, while Joe watches her from the distance. Cast Audrey Hepburn as Karen Wright * Shirley MacLaine as Martha Dobie * James Garner as Dr. Joseph \\"Joe\\" Cardin * Miriam Hopkins as Lily Mortar, Martha's aunt she nicknames \\"the duchess\\" * Fay Bainter as Mrs. Amelia Tilford * Karen Balkin as Mary Tilford, Amelia's granddaughter * Veronica Cartwright as Rosalie Wells * Mimi Gibson as Evelyn * William Mims as Mr. Burton * Sally Brophy as Mrs. Wells, Rosalie's mother * Hope Summers as Agatha Production Hellman's play was inspired by the 1809 true story of two Scottish school teachers whose lives were destroyed when one of their students accused them of engaging in a lesbian relationship, but in the Scottish case, they eventually won their suit, although that did not change the devastation upon their lives. At the time of the play's premiere (1934) the mention of homosexuality on stage was illegal in New York State, but authorities chose to overlook its subject matter when the Broadway production was acclaimed by the critics. The first film adaptation of the play was These Three directed by Wyler and released in 1936. Because the Hays Code, in effect at the time of the original film's production (1936), would never permit a film to focus on or even hint at lesbianism, Samuel Goldwyn was the only producer interested in purchasing the rights. He signed Hellman to adapt her play for the screen, and the playwright changed the lie about the two school teachers being lovers into a rumor that one of them had slept with the other's fianc√©. Because the Production Code refused to allow Goldwyn to use the play's original title, it was changed to The Lie, and then These Three. By the time Wyler was ready to film the remake in 1961, the Hays Code had been liberalized to allow screenwriter John Michael Hayes to restore the original nature of the lie. Aside from having Martha hang rather than shoot herself as she had in the play, he remained faithful to Hellman's work, retaining substantial portions of her dialogue. In the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, Shirley MacLaine said she and Audrey Hepburn never talked about their characters' alleged homosexuality. She also claimed Wyler cut some scenes hinting at Martha's love for Karen because of concerns about critical reaction to the film. The film was James Garner's first after suing Warner Bros. to win his release from the television series Maverick. Wyler broke an unofficial blacklist of the actor by casting him, and Garner steadily appeared in films and television shows over the following decades, including immediately playing leading roles in four different major movies released in 1963: The Great Escape with Steve McQueen, The Thrill of It All with Doris Day, The Wheeler Dealers with Lee Remick, and Move Over, Darling again with box office queen Doris Day. Miriam Hopkins, who portrays Lily Mortar in the remake, appeared as Martha in These Three. The film's location shooting was done at the historic Shadow Ranch, in present-day West Hills of the western San Fernando Valley. Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed: Variety said, \\"Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine ... beautifully complement each other. Hepburn's soft sensitivity, marvelous projection and emotional understatement result in a memorable portrayal. MacLaine's enactment is almost equally rich in depth and substance.\\" TV Guide rated the film 3¬Ω out of four stars, adding \\"The performances range from adequate (Balkin's) to exquisite (MacLaine's).\\" Rotten Tomatoes gives the film 86% based on seven critic reviews.

He is a federal deputy to the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress from the fifth electoral region.SIL: Profile of Manuel Espino Barrientos Espino also was a federal deputy in the LVIII Legislature and from 2005 to 2007 served as the national president of the PAN. Life =Education and career in Chihuahua= In 1979, Espino received his degree as an electrical technician from the Regional Technological Institute of Durango; a year before, he had joined the PAN. He was a frequent representative of the party in electoral matters, as well as a Scout and an instructor teaching business training courses in Ciudad Ju√°rez and Durango; additionally, between 1978 and 1985, he was a middle and high school teacher at various educational institutions in Durango and Ciudad Ju√°rez, as well as an administrator of an accounting and administration company. Between 1983 and 1985, Espino acted as an intervening administrator at Zapater√≠a Bernini, a Ciudad Ju√°rez company. From 1983 and 1988, Espino worked in the General Directorate of Public Security of Ciudad Ju√°rez, first heading the department of Unit Control and later moving to Archives and Statistics; his final year in the agency was spent as a systems director. 1984 also saw Espino get involved in the founding of the Center of Hispanic- American Studies in El Paso, Texas, while the next year, he began a three-year term as president of the Mexican Scouts Association.SITL Profile: Manuel Espino Barrientos In 1987, after five years of study, Espino graduated from the Universidad del Noroeste with a degree in business administration; the next year, he began a short stint as a production supervisor at Honeywell Optoelectronics in Ciudad Ju√°rez. Espino's political career continued to center around the PAN in Ciudad Ju√°rez and Chihuahua. Between 1987 and 1989, he was the secretary of the Civil Resistance organization in the party; he served as a municipal-level general secretary from 1989‚Äì91 (which ended when he was tapped to be the interim president of the PAN in Ciudad Ju√°rez), a state councilor between 1990 and 1993, ran for federal deputy in 1991, and served again in the Chihuahua PAN from 1991‚Äì92. Also during this time, he was a founding member and vice president of the Foundation for the Cultural Diffusion of America's Half Millennium, between 1989 and 1992. In 1994, he served as a coordinator of the PAN's federal electoral campaign in Ciudad Ju√°rez, and at the same time, he ran as a proportional representation deputy from the second electoral region. He was the PAN's Security Coordinator and served as a secretary on the National Defense Commission; simultaneously, he served on the national PAN's Secretariat of National Relations, in the department that managed relations with the armed forces. =Shift to Sonora= In 1996, Espino became the head of the PAN in Sonora and served on its state executive council from 1999 to 2002. Additionally, he served as the municipal comptroller of Hermosillo between 1998 and 2000. In 2000, he returned to the Chamber of Deputies in its LVIII Legislature. He presided over the Special Commission on Public Security and also served on the Energy Commission. During this time, he simultaneously served as the travel coordinator for President Vicente Fox, as a national councilor for the PAN, and from 2002 to 2005, as the secretary general of the national PAN organization and a consultant to Grupo Industrial Fuentes. =Presidency of the PAN and expulsion= In 2005, Manuel Espino succeeded Luis Felipe Bravo and became the 18th president of the National Action Party, a position he held for two years. On November 11, 2006, he was elected president of the Christian Democrat Organization of America, a post he held until July 30, 2010, and between 2006 and 2009, he also was the vice president of Centrist Democrat International. However, during this time, a rift began to grow between Espino and the PAN president, Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa; he also disagreed with the federal government's security strategy, calling it \\"one of the bloodiest\\". The end of Espino's presidency in 2007 and his replacement with Germ√°n Mart√≠nez C√°zares, identified as close to Calder√≥n, came months after Espino and those associated with the highly conservative group Desarrollo Humano Integral, A.C., lost national party positions to supporters of Calder√≥n. In 2010, he founded the (National Start Over Movement). That year, the national PAN voted to begin the process of expelling Espino from the party, with only one member voting against the measure; this would culminate in his expulsion from the party after 33 years in May 2011; Espino promised to bring the case before the TEPJF. When he met with Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, who at the time was seeking election from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, he promised Pe√±a Nieto that he would promote the \\"useful vote\\" for Pe√±a Nieto among the 941,000 members of Volver a Empezar, which in turn prompted then-PAN leader Gustavo Madero Mu√±oz to note that one of the reasons for Espino's expulsion from the party was his previous support for PRI candidates. His business activities continued throughout this period; in 2010, he opened a restaurant in Durango, known as El Esquil√≥n. He also owned a parking facility and administered the company Negocios Maryam. =Movimiento Ciudadano and return to San L√°zaro= In 2013, Espino started a political group known as Concertaci√≥n Mexicana. The group included other former members of the PAN and PRD, such as Ren√© Arce (who returned to the PRD in 2015) and Jorge Carlos D√≠az Cuervo. While it promised to be a \\"party that was not ideological\\", it was derided as being a \\"Frankenstein\\" group. However, in its attempts to become a political party, it ran into obstacles; in Puebla, it failed to get 3,000 people to attend its first meeting, as was required, and in the states where it did meet the numbers, it did so using infrastructure of state-level political parties. When he traveled to an event in Cuernavaca, organizers had to remove dozens of empty chairs from the venue. Ultimately, Espino decided not to form a political party. On December 6, 2014, Espino officially joined the Movimiento Ciudadano political party. The next year, MC placed Espino on its list for proportional representation deputies from the fifth district, winning him a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature. He is a secretary on the National Defense and Public Security Committees and also holds a seat on the Commission for the Strengthening of Federalism. Movimiento Ciudadano has also allied with Concertaci√≥n Mexicana in select regions, such as Quintana Roo and on the national level while it worked with the Peninsular Party of the Californias in Baja California and with Alternativa Veracruzana in Veracruz. Books Espino has written various books, including Se√±al de Alerta (2008), which warned that Manlio Fabio Beltrones might run for president in 2012; Volver a Empezar (Start Over, 2010); La guerra injusta de Ciudad Ju√°rez (The Unjust War of Ciudad Ju√°rez, 2010), in which he called the drug war started by Calder√≥n \\"the bloodiest conflict on Mexican soil since the Revolution\\"; El Poder del √Åguila (The Power of the Eagle, 2012); and Mexicanos al Grito de Paz (2015).

It was abolished in West Germany in 1949 and East Germany in 1987. The last person executed in Germany was the East German Werner Teske, killed in an East German prison in Leipzig in 1981. Current legal position The current Constitution of Germany (\\"Grundgesetz f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland\\"), which came into effect on 23 May 1949, forbids capital punishment. This ban is stated in article 102 GG: \\"Die Todesstrafe ist abgeschafft\\" - Capital punishment is abolished. Grundgesetz f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland 29.7.2009 Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (Official english translation Stand 22.09.09) It is debated among constitutional jurists whether article 102 GG in combination article 2 section 2 GG ‚Äì \\"Jeder hat das Recht auf Leben und k√∂rperliche Unversehrtheit\\" (Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity) prohibits any targeted killing on the part of the state (e.g. in the context of a hostage situation).on this point, German Wikipedia (:de:Todesstrafe#cite ref-169) cites Roman Herzog: Todesstrafe I. Rechtlich B. Verfassungsrechtlich. In: Evangelisches Staatslexikon. Band 2, Stuttgart 1987, Sp. 3614. There has also been debate on the question whether this article could legally be abolished by a two-thirds majority in Bundestag and Bundesrat. Section 3 of article 79 GG expressly prohibits only amendments of articles 1 to 20, which suggests that article 102 can in principle legally be amended or repealed under article 79. However some legal scholars have argued that the prohibition of capital punishment follows necessarily from article 2 GG, and article 102 GG merely puts the prohibition beyond doubt. It has also been argued that Article 102, according to its systematical place, does not guarantee a basic right but enacts a judicial restriction.Roman Herzog: Todesstrafe I. Rechtlich B. Verfassungsrechtlich. In: Evangelisches Staatslexikon. Band 2, Stuttgart 1987, Sp. 3615. The German Federal Court of Justice in 1995 has argued that \\"concerns\\" (Bedenken) related to the general nature of the death penalty \\"suggest\\" (legen den Befund nahe) that capital punishment should indeed be considered inadmissible already as a consequence of the guarantee of human dignity in article 1 GG. \\"Die staatliche Organisation einer Vollstreckung der Todesstrafe ist schlie√ülich, gemessen am Ideal der Menschenw√ºrde, ein schlechterdings unzumutbares und unertr√§gliches Unterfangen.

Previous death sentences were replaced by life imprisonment. As the constitution requires that prisoners have a chance of regaining freedom with other means than extralegal pardon only,as ruled by the Federal Constitutional Court in BVerfGE 45,147 in 1977. prisoners are checked for release on parole after 15 years for regular intervals. Since the introduction of this provision, courts may in extreme cases declare special gravity of guilt which is meant and popularized as life without parole.Though some realistic hope for regaining freedom must still be guaranteed. In 2017 the German Federal Constitutional Court, in its verdict on the attempt to ban the National Democratic Party of Germany, considered the party's demand for a referendum on the reintroduction of capital punishment as anti-constitutional and incompatible with the liberal democratic basic order.Verdict of the Federal Constitutional Court, January 17, 2017 (German). Although article 21.1 of the constitution of the German state of Hesse provided capital punishment for high crimes, this provision was inoperative due to the federal ban on the death penalty (\\"Bundesrecht bricht Landesrecht.\\" (article 31 GG) ‚Äì Federal law overrides state law.article 31 GG It would, of course, also be inactive due to lack of an implementing penal law today.). The capital punishment provision was finally scrapped from Hesse's state constitution in 2018 by popular vote, with 83% of the votes in favor. The Bavarian Constitution, while not providing the death penalty by itself, for a long time contained a rule of implementation of itThe execution of capital punishment requires previous confirmation by the government, article 47 IV 2 (old form) of the Bavarian Constitution. which was abrogated in a summary constitutional amendment in 1998. History =Holy Roman Empire= In the Holy Roman Empire, high justice originally was reserved to the king. From the 13th century, it was transferred to the king's vassals along with their fiefs. The first codification of capital punishment was the Halsgerichtsordnung passed by Maximilian I in 1499, followed in 1507 by the Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis. Both codes formed the basis of the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (CCC), passed in 1532 under Charles V. In the Habsburg Monarchy, all regional codes were superseded by the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana in 1768. =Confederation and Reich 1849‚Äì1933 = If the German constitution enacted by the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849 had come into force, capital punishment would have been abolished in most cases, since Art. III ¬ß 139 of the constitution stated: \\"Die Todesstrafe, ausgenommen wo das Kriegsrecht sie vorschreibt, oder das Seerecht im Fall von Meutereien sie zul√§√üt, [...], [ist] abgeschafft\\" (\\"Capital punishment, except when it is prescribed by martial law or permitted by the law of the seas in cases of mutiny, [...] [is] abolished\\"). These lines were deleted in the constitution for the Erfurt Union of 1849/1850. Historian Christopher Clark noted that the death penalty was not very prevalent in Prussia. His work compared the number of executions in Prussia to the number in England and Wales in the first half of the 19th century, which together had about the same population as Prussia. Every year, England and Wales executed about sixteen times as many people. While in Prussia the death penalty was usually applied only in murder cases, the English also executed people for theft, sometimes even in minor cases.Christopher Clark: Preu√üen. Aufstieg und Niedergang. 1600‚Äì1947. BpB, Bonn 2007, p. 534. The German Empire (1871‚Äì1918) inflicted the death penalty for some forms of (1) high treason and for (2) murder. Murder was defined as killing with premeditation; only murder or attempted murder of one's sovereign was capital treason.¬ß 80, 211 StGB 1871. Souvereign was not only the Emperor, but also the Prince of both one's own State and the State of momentary sojourn. Under military law, in case of a war only, some other particularly listed forms of (3) treason, some cases of (4) wrongful surrender, (5) desertion in the field in case of relapse, if the previous desertion also had taken place in the field, (6) cowardice if it led to a flight with enticing one's comrades to flight, (7) explicit disobeying an order by word or deed in the face of the enemy, (8) sedition in the face of the enemy, or in the field (only) if done as a ringleader or instigator, or with violence as a leading man.Milit√§r-Strafgesetzbuch f√ºr das Deutsche Reich (MStGB) During the German empire, the legal methods were the hand-held axe, in some states also the guillotine for civilian crimes, and the firing squad for military crimes. According to Manfred Messerschmidt,Manfred Messerschmidt, Die Wehrmachtjustiz 1933-1945, . \\"from 1907 to 1932,\\" i. e. including World War I, \\"Germany had issued 1547 death warrants, of which 393 were executed. The Weimar Republic retained the death penalty for murder, and several murderers were guillotined. =Nazi Germany= As to the National Socialists, the leading Nazi jurist Hans Frank boasted at the 1934 Reichsparteitag of ‚Äúreckless implementation of the death penalty‚Äù as a special acquisition of the Nazi regime. Under Hitler nearly 40,000 death sentences were handed down, mainly by the Volksgerichtshof and also by the Reich Military Tribunal. Executions were carried out most often by beheading using the guillotine, which in 1936 was ordained the official means of civil execution of capital punishment. From 1942 hanging by using the short-drop method was also used, notoriously in the reprisals in the aftermath of the 20 July plot. A firing squad was reserved for military offenders. Additional forms declared treason could (in some cases, especially for soldiers, mandatorily) be prosecuted with death, as could grave arson,As enacted by the Reichstag Fire Decree. A further law, the Lex van der Lubbe, provided restrospective application so that Marinus van der Lubbe could be \\"executed\\" or, rather, murdered. aiding and abetting treason, betraying a secret (mandatorily), procuring a secret for the sake of betraying it, insidious publishing or rhetoric, failure to denounce a capital crime, destroying means for military use, sabotage (mandatorily for soldiers), kidnapping (mandatorily),Cf. the respective forms of the StGB compassing or imagining the death of a NS or state official for political reasons or the reason of their service,Law for the upholding of the legal peace, ¬ß 1. setting a car trap for the means of robbery (mandatorily), espionage (mandatorily), partisanry (mandatorily), all cases of desertion, subversion of military strength (mandatorily except for minor cases),Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung looting (mandatorily even in cases of smallest amounts), arson which damages the power of defense of the people, crime during danger resulting from enemy aviation (in grave cases), taking advantage of the state of war whilst committing a crime (\\"if the sound feeling of the people so requires\\"), publishing foreign radio broadcasts, etc. The definition of murder was changed and, in practice, extended to the rather vague definition still in force, but now only with life imprisonment. This list is by no means exhaustive, even where laws and decrees are concerned. As an addition to crimes declared capital by law or decree, a \\"dangerous habitual criminal\\" or one convicted of rape could be executed \\"if the protection of the people or the need for just atonement so demands\\".Law of 1941 for the amendment of the Penal Code, ¬ß 1 Courts (or whatever was in place of a court) sometimes were officially granted the right to inflict the death penalty, even where not provided by law, and sometimes did so by their own discretion. Many of the crimes covered a wide and unpredictable range of actions, such as treason, \\"sabotage\\" (Kriegsverrat, which was any action pandering the enemy) and subversion of the military strength, which could be interpreted as to cover any critical remark, and even though even it clearly did not cover it was applied to execute any conscientious objector. To quote Hitler, \\"after ten years of hard prison, a man is lost to the people's community anyway. Thus what to do with such a guy is either put him into a concentration camp, or kill him. In latest times the latter is more important, for the sake of deterrence.\\"as in: Richard J. Evans: Rituale der Vergeltung. Berlin 2001, S. 828 During 1933‚Äì1945, Wehrmacht courts issued, conservatively estimated, 25,000 death warrants, of which 18,000 to 20,000 were executed.\\" According to official statistics,As reported on the German wikipedia other courts had altogether issued 16,560 death warrants (contrasting with 664 before the war), of which about 12,000 were executed. In fighting partisans, 345,000 are reported to have been killed, of which less than 10% may have been partisans.Wolfgang Curilla: Die deutsche Ordnungspolizei und der Holocaust im Baltikum und Wei√ürussland 1941-1944, Paderborn 2006, S. 742. This, however, should not obscure the fact that not only the National Socialist legal system was tyrannical (especially also with the protective custody, to be inflicted at the Gestapo's arbitration and to be fulfilled in a concentration camp), but this law also was broken to the detriment of those persecuted or opposing. A concentration camp commander could as early as in 1933 inflict the \\"death penalty\\" for disobedience, i. e. order to murder a disobedient inmate, without any legal ground whatsoever besides the will of Heinrich Himmler, but also without meeting opposition. Himmler himself offered an honorable way out for members of the SS who were convicted of capital crimes-they were locked in a room with a revolver and one live round, then given several hours to use it. After their deaths any surviving family were given pensions. Bl. Bishop Clemens of M√ºnster correctly saw himself legally obliged to denounce to the criminal police those responsible for the Action T4, i. e. the killing of the handicapped, for murder (then: killing with premeditation); likewise, no law even of the Nazis allowed extermination through work, and genocidal mass murder, as in the case of the Holocaust. Charles Lane (writer for The Washington Post) claims the abolishment of capital punishment was a reaction not to its extensive use under the Third Reich, but to the execution of convicted Nazi war criminals by the International War Crimes Tribunal.source A 2017 study found that \\"judges more committed to the Nazi Party were more likely to impose the death sentence on defendants belonging to organised political opposition groups, those accused of violent resistance and those with characteristics to which Nazism was intolerant.\\" =After World War II= After World War II, limited executions of common and war criminals were carried out on West German soil. The last common criminal to be executed in the Western Zones under German authority was Richard Schuh (murder and robbery) on February 18, 1949; in West Berlin the last execution was of Berthold Wehmeyer (murder, rape and robbery) on May 12, 1949. Despite the newly founded Federal Republic's protests, the Western Allied powers continued for some time to inflict the death penalty in their separate jurisdiction. The last war criminals being executed on June 7, 1951 at Landsberg prison.Norbert Frei, Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration. Columbia University Press, 2002. p 173 Until 1990, some \\"criminal actions against the Allied Occupating Powers' interests\\" remained capital in West Berlin, being under Allied jurisdiction without complete force of the Basic Law. However, no capital sentences under this authority were carried out. East Germany abolished the death penalty in 1987. The last execution in East Germany is believed to have been the shooting of Werner Teske, convicted for treason, in 1981; the last execution of a civilian (after 1970, capital punishment was rare and almost exclusively for espionage) was Erwin Hagedorn, for sexually motivated child murder. By then, East German courts had inflicted the death penalty in 227 cases. 166 were executed, of which 52 for assumedly political crimes (espionage, sabotage etc.), 64 for crimes under Hitler's rule and 44 for common criminality (mostly murder under aggravated circumstances). Most of these took place during the 1950s; three known executions took place in the 70s and two in the 80s. The guillotine (called the Fallschwertmaschine, \\"falling sword machine\\") was used for the last time on former SS doctor Horst Fischer in 1966, after which it was replaced by execution by shooting (an \\"unexpected close shot in the back of the head\\"; \\"unerwarteter Nahschuss in das Hinterhaupt\\").Hinrichtungen in Leipzig, B√ºrgerkomitee Leipzig e.V East Germany was notable for its secrecy about its executions, even when the death warrants had been issued in show trials; death certificates mostly stated instead \\"heart failure\\".

Records. With the exception of three cover songs, Song Cycle was written and composed by Parks, while its production was credited to future Warner Bros. Records president Lenny Waronker. The album draws from a number of American popular music genres, including bluegrass, ragtime, and show tunes, and frames classical styles in the context of 1960s pop music. The material utilizes unconventional song structures, and lyrically explores American history and culture, reflecting Parks' history working in both the film and music industries of Southern California. Upon its release, Song Cycle was largely acclaimed by critics despite lukewarm sales, and later gained status as a cult album. In 2017, Song Cycle was ranked the 93rd greatest album of the 1960s by Pitchfork. Background Parks in 1967 In Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, Van Dyke Parks became known as an in-demand session pianist, working with such artists as The Byrds, Tim Buckley, and Paul Revere & the Raiders. At the same time, he had been unsatisfied with contemporary pop music and its increasing submissiveness to the British invasion, going so far as to say, \\"apart from Pet Sounds I didn't find anything striking coming out of the United States.\\" Wanting to give \\"an American experience which would be uniquely disassociable from the Beatles/British pop viewpoint,\\" he was involved with numerous works that would indulge his interest in Depression-era American pop and folk music, such as co-writing and arranging much of Harper's Bizarre's second album Anything Goes; releasing his own singles \\"Come to the Sunshine\\", \\"Number Nine\\", \\"Colours\\"; and most notably providing lyrical content to The Beach Boys' ill-fated Smile album. For his collaborations with Brian Wilson, Parks was signed as a recording artist by Warner Bros. Records. The label reportedly expected that Parks could deliver a smashing commercial success on par with the Beach Boys at that time. The resulting album was backed by producer Lenny Waronker, who placed Parks' musical freedom over budgetary constraints. Recording The album's sessions cost more than US$35,000 (exceeding US$ today), making it one of the most expensive pop albums ever recorded up to that time ‚Äî in 1967, the typical budget for a pop studio album was about $10,000 (US$ today). The producers were able to make early use of an eight- track professional reel-to-reel recorder, which was used to mix second generation four-track tape that had been transferred from another four-track recording for overdubs. Parks has added that the bulk of the album was done \\"before Sgt. Pepper reared its ugly head\\", and that Randy Newman had written \\"Vine Street\\" especially for him. () Many Los Angeles recording facilities were used, not because of any particular sound preference, but to maximize studio time. Song Cycle contained experimental production and recording methods, including varispeed and regenerated tape delay. Audio engineer Bruce Botnick is credited for inventing the \\"Farkle\\" effect, an ingenious modification to a Sunset Sound Recorders echo box. The Farkle effect was used most prominently on violins, harps, and the intro to \\"The All Golden\\", and involved very thin splicing tape folded like a fan attached to a tape overhead. The album opens with a recording of guitarist Steve Young performing \\"Black Jack Davy\\", a 17th-century ballad. Release The album had the provisional title Looney Tunes, a nod to the cartoons produced by Warner Brothers' film division. According to Parks, Nonetheless, Parks has expressed that the album hadn't turned out exactly as he wanted, saying \\"An album with no songs was entirely unintentional,\\" and considered the album more of a learning exercise \\"made with a mindset about the importance of studio exploration.\\" Reception In his column for Esquire, music critic Robert Christgau felt that Song Cycle does not \\"rock\\" and had \\"serious reservations about [Parks'] precious, overwrought lyrics and the reedy way he sings them, but the music on this album is wonderful.\\" Warner Bros. press sheets advertised Song Cycle as \\"the most important, creative and advanced pop recording since Sgt. Pepper.\\" Although it received good reviews upon release, Song Cycle sold slowly, and took at least three years to pay for the original studio sessions. AllMusic's Jason Ankeny has described the album as In response to the poor sales of the record after its release, Warner Bros. Records ran full page newspaper and magazine advertisements written by staff publicist Stan Cornyn that said they \\"lost $35,509 on 'the album of the year' (dammit).\\"Splice Today article: \\"INTERVIEW: Van Dyke Parks.\\" The ad said that those who actually purchased the album had likely worn their copies out by playing it over and over, and suggested that listeners send in worn out copies to Warner Bros. in return for two new copies, including one \\"to educate a friend with.\\" Incensed by the tactic, Parks accused Cornyn of trying to kill his career. Excerpts from positive reviews were reprinted in these ads, which included statements written by the Los Angeles Free Press (\\"The most important art rock project\\"), Rolling Stone (\\"Van Dyke Parks may come to be considered the Gertrude Stein of the new pop music\\"), and The Hollywood Reporter (\\"Very esoteric\\"). Many musicians cite the album as an influence, including producer and songwriter Jim O'Rourke. O'Rourke worked with Parks and harpist Joanna Newsom on Newsom's record Ys. Joanna Newsom sought out the partnership with Van Dyke Parks after listening to Song Cycle.

This is achieved by electronically sharing a part of the legitimate conditional access smart card's output data, enabling all recipients to gain simultaneous access to scrambled DVB streams, held on the encrypted television network. Typically, a legitimate smart card is attached to a host digital television receiver, which is equipped with software to share the decrypted 64-bit \\"control word\\" key over a computer network, such as the Internet. Once a client receives this key, they can decrypt the encrypted content as though they were using their own subscription card. The theory of card sharing as a potential attack vector on pay TV encryption was provided in the book European Scrambling Systems by John McCormac in 1996; leading to the term \\"McCormac Hack\\" to be used to describe early card-sharing systems. https://www.insideview.ie/2003/08/sky_fears_mccor.html  Basic operation  The security of conditional access smart card technology is limited by the security of the DVB standard in which it operates. The standard practice of a legitimate smart card is to decrypt an ECM (Entitlement Control Message), which then provides the control word, which allows the viewing of scrambled material.http://www.eurasip.org/Proceedings/Ext/IST05/papers/60.pdf With card sharing, however, the smart card and its security features are bypassed; software intercepts the decrypted control word and allows the user to share it across a computer network.  Pirate decryption  Card sharing has established itself as popular method of pirate decryption. Much of the development of card sharing hardware and software has taken place in Europe, where national boundaries mean that home users are able to receive satellite television signals from many countries but are unable to legally subscribe to them due to licensing restrictions on broadcasters. Because the length of the complete control word is so small (64 bits), delivery of the control words to many different clients is easily possible on a home internet connection. This has sparked the creation of sharing network groups, in which users can access the group by sharing their subscription cards with the group, and in turn, being capable of receiving the channels which all users' cards can decrypt, as though the user owned every single subscription card connected to the network. Other networks have also been created, whereby one server has multiple legitimate subscription cards connected to it. Access to this server is then restricted to those who pay the server's owner their own subscription fee.  Multiple receiver use  An arguably legitimate use for card sharing is the sharing of the control word within a home network, where the subscriber is authorised by the subscription television network to decrypt their signal, using one smart card. Content providers usually provide means for viewing channels on a second smart card, provided at extra cost. An example of this is Sky Multiroom, used in the United Kingdom. However, in some cases the contract between the subscriber and the content provider implicitly or explicitly prohibits this kind of card sharing.  Countermeasures  Card sharing is a particular concern to conditional access providers, and their respective pay- TV companies, as well as the DVB consortium. Card sharing utilises the integral scrambling system of the DVB standard, DVB-CSA, meaning that every provider of scrambled DVB content has potential to be affected by it. In response, several counter measures have been implemented by various parties, with the aim of permanently preventing it. =Technical= One technical method, implemented by providers such as Irdeto and NDS, is to update the software of digital receivers provided by the subscription television service. This software implements a further decryption layer, held within the receiver. Rather than sending a plain text control word from the smart card to the receiver's microprocessor, which can be intercepted, the decrypted ECM will in fact be an encrypted control word, which can only be decrypted by a legitimate, non card sharing capable, receiver. A simpler method, used by several providers, is to simply increase the frequency of control word changes. With changes occurring as frequently as once every few seconds, extra stress is put onto the smart card sharing system, meaning that clients may be frustrated by short, frequent, missed viewing periods. =Legal= One significant problem for internet card sharing is that the activity can be traced, through tracing of the originating IP address - though this does not identify an individual it can may to a specific ISP and/or TV service subscription. Cases of criminal charges being brought against card sharing hosts is on the rise.http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2008/10/24/french-police- question-card-sharing-ring/ In August 2009, a Liverpool man was prosecuted for re-selling the services of a card sharing network to paying customers. It was the first such case of its type in the UK.http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local- news/2009/08/29/liverpool-sky-tv-box-cheat-is-jailed-in-uk- first-100252-24559449/ Two further raids occurred in the UK during early 2011, instigated by UK Cable Operator Virgin Media.http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2011/02/08/derby-three-on-virgin-fraud- charge/ =DVB-CSA3= In 2007, the DVB Project approved and began licensing a new scrambling system, CSA3, for protecting DVB content. This new system, upon implementation, will attempt to eradicate many of the flaws with the original DVB-CSA system, including introducing an AES based 128-bit key system. The system will reportedly be \\"hardware friendly and software unfriendly\\", indicating that reverse engineering of the system, required for the creation of card sharing applications, will be very difficult.

However, documents dating back to the period of Devasahayam Pillai show that conversion of court officials to Christianity was not tolerated.Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo (1748-1806), Voyage to the East Indies, 1800 (original Italian, 1796). He writes: \\"The king of Travancore threatens with imprisonment and death every nobleman who shall quit his court to become a Christian, and who shall afterwards fall into his hands; and indeed Nilampulla, an officer of a noble family, was shot at Arampalli because he refused to renounce the religion of Jesus Christ. In the year 1787 I saw four Nayiris or noble Shudris, thrown into prison at Tiruvandaburam, because they would not apostasise from the Catholic Church.\\" (pp. 207-208). On 28 June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to promulgate a decree regarding the martyrdom of Devasahayam Pillai and he was referred to as \\"Venerable\\". On 2 December 2012, a ceremony of beatification and declaration of martyrdom was held in Nagercoil, in the Roman Catholic diocese of Kottar in Southern India, presided over by Angelo Cardinal Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, acting as papal delegate.

Retrieved 4 December 2012. On 21 February 2020, Pope Francis recognized a miracle attributed to the intercession of Devasahayam, clearing his way to canonization (sainthood). He will be the first lay Catholic in India to become a saint.Pope clears India's first layman for canonization Biography according to Roman Catholic tradition =Early life= Devasahayam Pillai (named Neelakanda Pillai at birth) was born into an affluent Nair-caste family at Nattalam in the present-day Kanyakumari District, on 23 April 1712.Amalagiri Anthonymuthu, \\"Vedasatchi Devasahayam Pillai Virivaana Varalaaru\\" , Nanjil Book Stall, Nagercoil, 1988, 3rd Edn.,2006, Page:15. His father Vasudevan Namboodiri, hailed from Kayamkulam, in present-day Kerala state, and was working as a priest at Sri Adi Kesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar in present-day Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu. His mother Devaki Amma hailed from Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari District. In the Nair matrilineal traditions of the day, Devasahayam Pillai was raised by his maternal uncle, and was inculcated with Hindu beliefs and traditions early on. Devasahayam's family had much influence in the royal palace of Maharaja Marthanda Varma, king of Travancore, and Devasahayam went into the service of the royal palace as a young man. His capabilities and enthusiasm did not go unnoticed in the palace, as he was soon put in charge of state affairs as an official under Ramayyan Dalawa, the Dewan of Travancore.Rosario Narchison J, \\"Martyr Devasahayam: A Documented History\\", Bishop's House, Nagercoil, 2002. =Conversion to Christianity= In 1741, Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, a Dutch naval commander, was sent on command of a Dutch naval expedition by the Dutch East India Company to capture Colachel, a port under the control of Travancore, and establish a trading post there.http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/NewsDigest.htm In the battle (Battle of Colachel) that followed between the Travancore forces and De Lannoy's men, the Dutch forces were defeated and the men were either killed or captured. Eustachius De Lannoy, his assistant Donadi and a few other Dutch soldiers were captured and imprisoned.V. Nagam Aiya, The Travancore State Manual Vol. 1, 1906 De Lannoy and the Dutchmen were later pardoned by the king, on condition that they serve in the Travancore army. De Lannoy later earned the trust of the king and went on to become the commander of the Travancore armed forces, winning many battles and annexing various neighbouring territories to Travancore. It was during their influential roles under the King of Travancore that Devasahayam Pillai and De Lannoy became well acquainted. De Lannoy's Christian faith interested Devasahayam and De Lannoy enlightened him on the faith, leading to his conversion in 1745. =Baptism= On Devasahayam's acceptance of the Christian faith, he was baptized at the Roman Catholic Latin Rite church at Vadakkankulam village (in the present Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu), where the Jesuits had a mission under Rev. Fr. R. Bouttari Italus S.J. Neelakanda Pillai, his name at birth, was then changed to Lazar, although he is more widely known by the Tamil & Malayalam translation Devasahayam (meaning God's help).History of the Diocese , Roman Catholic Diocese of Kottar, 2010. Retrieved 2012-05-25. Pillai was married by this time to Bargavi Ammal from Kunchu Veedu, Elanthavilai, Mayicode in Travancore Province. She was also persuaded and converted to Christianity by her husband. His wife was given the baptismal name of Gnanapoo Ammaal (equivalent to Theresa in Tamil & Malayalam). Fearing reprisal in Travancore against her religious conversion, she chose to be a migrated- resident of this village. Some of Devasahayam Pillai's immediate family members also received baptism later, after being converted to Christianity. =Orders based on accusations and charges= Church chroniclers say that the Brahmin chief priest of the kingdom, the feudal lords, members of the royal household and the Nair community brought false charges on Devasahayam to the Dewan, Ramayyan Dalawa. Pillai was divested of his portfolio in the administration and was later accused of treason and of divulging state secrets to rivals and Europeans. He was later arrested and tortured for three years. After his execution orders were passed, he was initially ordered to be taken on a buffalo to Kuzhumaikkad, where he would be executed.Pushpa Raj P, \\"Devasahayam Pillai: The Martyr\\", Nanjil Book Stall, Nagercoil, 1988, 2nd Edn., 2005Stephen, A.P., \\"Retham Chintha Chintha\\" , Kottar Diocese, Nagercoil, 1975, page 29. But the original Royal order was altered later to finally to be taken on a buffalo back to Aralvaimozhy border for a meaningful punishment of banishment after carrying out a series of tortures by ten different karyakkars on the advice of the ministers. =Other traditions and beliefs= Blessed Devasahayam is believed to have prayed on this rock and left imprints of his knee and elbow A closer look of the rock where Blessed Devasahayam is believed to have prayed and left imprints of his knee and elbow St. Xavier's Cathedral, diocese of Kottar Tomb in front of the main-altar of St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Kottar, Nagercoil Devasahayam Pillai was marched from Padmanabhapuram Palace to Aralvaimozhy by soldiers, over the period of a few days. Pillai was treated like a criminal and as was customary in those days for criminals, his body was painted with red and black spots, and was intentionally marched through populated areas, sitting backward on top of a water buffaloSamuel Mateer, Native Life in Travancore, London, 1883. . Page 291. (the mythical vehicle or vahana of Yama, the lord of death in Hinduism) through the streets of South Travancore. As a method of torture, he was beaten every day with eighty stripes, pepper rubbed in his wounds and nostrils, exposed to the sun, and given only stagnant water to drink. While halting at Puliyoorkurichi, not far away from the Padmanabhapuram Palace of the Travancore king, it is believed by Christians that God quenched his thirst by letting water gush through a small hole on a rock, the very place where he knelt to pray. The water hole is still found in the compound of a church at Puliyoorkurichi, about 15 km from Nagercoil. It is also believed that the leaves of a neem (Margosa) tree in the village of Peruvilai, to which he had been tied while being marched to Aralvaimozhy, cured illnesses of sick people in the village and around. Many more miracles are attributed to Devasahayam Pillai. =Death= In 1752, the original order of the King and his Dewan was to deport him from Travancore, into the Pandya country, at Aralvaimozhy. He was let off in the forested hills near Aralvaimozhy. There, he is believed to have begun deep meditations, and the people from the adjacent villages began visiting the holy man. Christian sources allege that at this time, high caste Hindus plotted to do away with Devasahayam. Some people believe that the soldiers went up the forested hills and tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which he took the gun in his hands, blessed it and gave it back to the soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished to. The soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was then carelessly thrown out near the foothills at Kattadimalai.Thangasami M.S.J., \\"Vanjinaattu Vedasaatchi Devasahayam Pillai Varalaaru\\" , Nanjil Pathippaham, Nagercoil, 1989. It was at Kattadimalai in Kanyakumari district that Devasahayam Pillai died on 14 January 1752. The Izhasa Naadu Pandiyan soldiers in Pattazham Vilai sent Kamanayakkampatti traders to search the forest; they found Pillai's decomposed body and carried it to the Kottar Church. His mortal remains were interred near the altar inside St. Xavier's Church, Kottar, Nagercoil, which is now the diocesan Cathedral. Since the days of the interment of the mortal remains of Devesahayam Pillai many Christian pilgrims visited his tomb and offered prayers.100,000 PILGRIMS VISIT LAY MARTYR PILLAI¬¥S SHRINE IN SOUTHERN INDIA 10 april 1996 Canonization efforts According to the report submitted by the then Bishop of Cochin (under whom Kanyakumari church was then functioning) in 1756 CE, the Christian martyrdom of Devasahayam Pillai was promptly intimated to Vatican. Prominent witnesses to his saintliness and martyrdom include Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar.Gover Nethor Parammakkal Thoma Kathanar, \\"Vathamana Pusthakam\\" (Malayalam), First Travelogue in an Indian language & Malankara Catholic records, edited by Most Rev. Fr. Thomas Muthedan, published by Janatha Book Stall, Thevara, Ernakulam, 1778‚Äì87. In 1780, Kariattil Ouseph Malpan submitted a petition to the Vatican for canonization of Devasahayam Pillai.Kariattil Ouseph Malpan The church historian C. M. Agur concluded in 1903 that although apostasy was never considered illegal in Travancore, it was not viewed indifferently, particularly in the case of the King's palace servants, and this led to the martyrdom of Devasahayam Pillai.Agur, C. M., Church History of Travancore, Madras, 1903, Reprint: Asian Educational Services, New Delhi, 1990, Part II, Chapter V. In 1984, a group of lay persons from the diocese of Kottar, especially members of Nagercoil Catholic Club, once again took the initiative to seek the beatification of Devasahayam.Process of beatification on devotees' website This is unusual for a layman, but he is regarded as one who was totally devoted to Christ. At the beginning of the 21st century, many Christian devotees were offering prayers at his tomb in St. Xavier's Cathedral of the diocese of Kottar. After a series of initiatives by the diocese of Kottar and much deliberation, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI), Tamil Nadu Bishops' Council (TNBC), later in 2004, duly recommended his beatification, following scrutiny of available historical evidence, in consultation with others. Bishop Chrysostom said that the CBCI did not intend any controversy whatsoever in moving this forward. Professor A. Sreedhara Menon (1925‚Äì2010), a noted historian and writer on Travancore, said that no cases of persecution in the name of religious conversion were recorded in the history of the kingdom. P. Parameswaran, president of the Hindu spiritual organisation Vivekananda Kendra, accused the CBCI of an attempt to hurt Hindu sentiments. Referring to the Travancore state manual, he insisted that Devasahayam was a palace employee who was executed after confirmation of sedition, because he had tampered with palace records and passed them to De Lannoy. However, Catholic records of the time state that the kingdom of Travancore did not tolerate palace officials converting to Christianity. In June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI officially recognized a decree from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints stating that he lived a life of \\"heroic virtues\\" ‚Äì a major step towards beatification ‚Äì and Pillai was then referred to as \\"Venerable\\". =Beatification and declaration as a martyr= Devasahayam Pillai was declared a Martyr and Blessed on 2 December 2012, at a solemn ceremony held in the Diocese of Kottar at Carmel Higher Secondary School Grounds, Nagercoil, near the place of his burial. The Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Angelo Cardinal Amato presided at the function as Delegate of Pope Benedict XVI. Several cardinals, archbishops and bishops from India and elsewhere, as well as numerous priests, religious men and women and over 100,000 Catholics from all over India participated in the grand ceremony which included a Solemn Pontifical Mass. Among the dignitaries officiating at the altar were Angelo Cardinal Amato, Oswald Cardinal Gracias (Archbishop of Mumbai), Telesphore P. Cardinal Toppo (Archbishop of Ranchi), George Cardinal Alencherry (Major Archbishop of Syro-Malabar Catholic Church), Moran Mor Baselios Cleemis Catholicos (Major Archbishop of Syro-Malankara Catholic Church), Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio (Apostolic Nuncio to India), and Bishop Peter Remigius (Bishop of Kottar). Devasahayam Pillai is the first lay person from India to be beatified by the Catholic Church. On the same day as Devasahayam Pillai was declared a Blessed in the Diocese of Kottar, India, Pope Benedict XVI addressed the pilgrims gathered in Rome. During his Angelus Message the Pope mentioned the event in Italian and English.Pope Benedict on Devasahayam Pillai's Beatification He said in Italian: > Today in Kottar, India, Devasahayam Pillai, a faithful layman, who lived in > the 18th century and died a martyr, was proclaimed Blessed. Let us join in > the joy of the Church in India and pray that this newly Beatified sustain > the faith of the Christians of that great and noble country. Then he addressed the crowds in English: > I welcome all gathered here today to pray with me. I especially greet the > people of Kottar who celebrate today the beatification of Devasahayam > Pillai. His witness to Christ is an example of that attentiveness to the > coming of Christ recalled by this first Sunday of Advent.

Places of interest Devasahayam Pillai is buried in the Cathedral of St. Francis Xavier at Kottar in Nagercoil. Devasahayam's tomb has been restored and beautified in view of the declaration of martyrdom and beatification.Bishop Peter Remigius, \\"Circular Letter on the Martyrdom and Beatification of Devasahayam Pillai\\", Kottar Newsletter, August 2012, Bishop's House, Nagercoil, India. Devasahyam Pillai's clothes and other belongings are kept in a church in the small town of Vadakkankulam in Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu State, India. They are exposed at the church on 15 August every year, the feast of the Assumption of Mary. His wife was buried in the cemetery there. Puliyoorkurichi, location of the water fountain believed to have quenched Devasahayam's thirst, is on the Nagercoil‚ÄìTrivandrum highway. Aralvaimozhy, where Devasahayam was killed, is on the Nagercoil‚ÄìTirunelveli highway. At that spot on the hillock (called Kaattadimalai), devotees believe that rocks fell and were broken at that moment. One rock at the place makes bell-like sounds when knocked with a stone. Canonization On 21 February 2020, Pope Francis recognized a miracle attributed to the intercession of Devasahayam, clearing his way to canonization (sainthood).

Potter, starring Cary Grant and Laraine Day. It recounts the tale of an attraction between a shady gambler and a wealthy socialite in the days prior to the United States entering World War II. Plot Swede (Charles Bickford) rows up to a public dock in a dinghy. He hides when he spots a young woman who walks to the end of the pier. When a new night watchman (an uncredited Emory Parnell) notices her, Swede stops him from bothering her. The sailor begins recounting her story, and the film segues into a long flashback. Joe \\"the Greek\\" Adams (Cary Grant) is a gambler and grifter with a couple of problems. First, he and his treacherous partner Zepp (Paul Stewart) have received draft notices to join the army in preparation for World War II. But he has a solution for this ‚Äì one of his underlings, Joe Bascopolous, has just died, and his status was 4F (unfit to serve). So one of them can dodge the draft by assuming his identity. They gamble for it; Zepp cheats, but Joe still wins. Zepp fails his physical examination anyway. The other problem is a lack of money to bankroll his gambling ship. He talks the head of the local War Relief organization, Captain Veronica Steadman (Gladys Cooper), into authorizing him to run a \\"charity\\" casino, promising to raise enough money to outfit a relief ship, despite the suspicions of her lieutenant, wealthy socialite Dorothy Bryant (Laraine Day). Eventually, he even charms Dorothy. She tells her snobbish grandfather (Henry Stephenson), to his great dismay, that \\"Joe's the first man I've ever met I'm afraid of. It's exciting.\\" At one point, Joe teaches Dorothy Australian rhyming slang, for example, \\"tit for tat\\" (hat), \\"twist and twirl\\" (girl), \\"storm and strife\\" (wife). Later, he renames his gambling ship the \\"Briny Marlin\\" (darling) in her honor. On the day of the charity ball, Joe receives a letter addressed to Bascopolous. Curious, he takes it to a Greek Orthodox priest for translation. It turns out to be from Bascopolous's mother in Axis- occupied Greece. She wrote to tell her son that when German paratroopers invaded their village, under his brothers' leadership, every man and boy fought to the death. Moved, Joe sits on a park bench, reexamining his life. At the ball, Joe's men use false bottoms in the cashboxes to steal most of the money. Joe has a change of heart and tells his right-hand man, the \\"Crunk\\" (Alan Carney), that the money is going to war relief. But Zepp overhears and forces him at gunpoint to collect the loot. Dorothy accidentally catches them in the act and thinks Joe is a willing participant. To protect her, he is forced to knock her out. Then, the two men start collecting the money. When Zepp briefly looks away, Joe attacks and kills him, but not before getting shot. Joe escapes, leaving behind a trail of blood. Then, he sends the money back to Dorothy via his trusted friend Swede. He loads his ship with the charity's supplies. Later, Dorothy is stricken when a policeman informs her Bascopolous is dead. Then she sees the photograph of the man; it is not her Joe. When the name of the ship Bascopolous worked on is mentioned, she rushes to the dock, just as the ship is leaving for Europe. She begs Joe to take her with him, but he tells her she deserves better and turns away to hide his own anguish. The ship is torpedoed and sunk on the return trip. Dorothy visits the pier each night. The flashback ends. Hoping Dorothy would be present, Swede arranges for Joe to meet him there. When Joe shows up at the other end of the pier, he wants to go out on the town to celebrate their last night in port rather than going back to their ship. Thinking quickly, the guard tells him he cannot leave the dinghy tied up where it is. The watchman settles who has to move it by flipping a coin and Joe loses. As Joe walks to the end of the dock, Dorothy sees him and rushes into his arms. Joe is taken aback, but then embraces her. Meanwhile, Swede examines the coin: it has two heads.

EIPH is common in horses undertaking intense exercise, but it has also been reported in human athletes, racing camels and racing greyhounds. Horses that experience EIPH may also be referred to as \\"bleeders\\" or as having \\"broken a blood vessel\\". In the majority of cases EIPH is not apparent unless an endoscopic examination of the airways is performed following exercise. This is distinguished from other forms of bleeding from the nostrils, called epistaxis. Epidemiology EIPH often occurs in horses that race at high speeds, with the number of affected race horses increasing in proportion to the speed and intensity of the exercise. It may occur in racing Thoroughbreds (flat racing, steeplechasing or jump racing), American Quarter Horses (incidence of 50‚Äì75%), Standardbreds (incidence of 40‚Äì60%), Arabians, and Appaloosas. EIPH also occurs in eventers, jumpers, polo ponies, endurance horses, draft horses that pull competitively, and horses taking part in Western speed events such as barrel racing, reining and cutting. It is rare in endurance horses or draft breeds. The lowest intensities of exercise which may cause EIPH are intense trotting (40‚Äì60% maximal oxygen uptake) and cantering at speeds of . EIPH occurs less frequently in stallions than mares or geldings. =Prevalence= Approximately 43 to 75% of horses have blood in the trachea and bronchi following a single post-race endoscopic examination. In one study, all horses endoscoped on at least three separate occasions following racing had EIPH at least once. Epistaxis (blood coming from one or both nostrils) is much less common, occurring in 0.25‚Äì13% of cases. In a survey of over 220,000 horse starts in UK Flat and National Hunt (jump) racing, 185 cases of epistaxis were identified (0.83 per 1000 starts). Similar frequencies have been reported in Japan (1.5 per 1000 starts) and South Africa (1.65 per 1000 starts), whereas a higher frequency has been reported in Korean (8.4 per 1000 starts). Clinical signs Unless a horse has severe EIPH, with blood present at the nostrils (known as epistaxis), the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and poor appetite post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by endoscopic examination of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a bronchoalveolar lavage. Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). Epistaxis is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. To confirm whether the blood is coming from the upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although in some cases it is not possible to determine the location. In the majority of epistaxis cases, the blood originates from the lung. Epistaxis during or following exercise can less commonly occur as a result of upper airway hemorrhage, for example following head trauma, subepiglottic cysts, atrial fibrillation, or guttural pouch mycoses. =Effects on performance= EIPH reduces a horse's racing performance. Severe EIPH (epistaxis) shortens a horse's racing career. Moderate to severe EIPH is associated with a worsened finishing position in a race, and finishing farther behind the winner. Horses with mild EIPH earn more prize money than those with more severe EIPH. While single bouts of EIPH may not even be apparent to the rider, owner or trainer of a horse unless an endoscopic examination is undertaken, the effect on performance within a single race appears to be significant but relatively subtle. In a 2005 study, horses finishing races with grade 4 EIPH were on average 6 metres behind those finishing with grade 0. However, the effect of repeated bouts of EIPH that occur with daily training may lead to more significant changes and a greater degree of tissue damage over time with consequent loss of lung function. Diagnosis As only one in ten cases of EIPH have epistaxis (bleeding from the nostrils), and as epistaxis can have causes other than EIPH, various diagnostic tools are used to diagnose EIPH. =Endoscopy= EIPH is most commonly diagnosed by endoscopic examination of the trachea and larger bronchi, with the optimal timing for endoscopy being 60‚Äì90 minutes after hard exercise. This post-exercise delay allows time for blood within the lungs to travel to the trachea. Blood can usually be detected in the trachea or bronchi for 1‚Äì3 days after an episode of EIPH, but may be present for up to a week. The amount of blood visible in the trachea at the time of examination is most commonly graded on a scale of 0 (no blood) to 4 (airways awash with blood). In some mildly-affected horses, endoscopy must be performed on multiple occasions to confirm a diagnosis of EIPH. The level of restraint required to allow endoscopy to be performed depends on the horse; a nose twitch or sedation may be required. =Cytopathology= Cytopathology (examination under a microscope) of either a tracheal wash or a bronchoalveolar lavage sample can determine whether EIPH has occurred. The number of red blood cells present can be quantified using a hemocytometer. A normal lung wash sample contains fewer than 10 red blood cells/Œºl of fluid. In the case of EIPH, the numbers will be several magnitudes or more higher. The presence of high numbers of hemosiderophages indicate that hemorrhage has occurred in the lung at some time in the past. Hemosiderophages are alveolar macrophages that have ingested and digested red blood cells from previous episodes of EIPH. The end product of the digestion of the red blood cells is an iron-storage complex known as hemosiderin. Bronchoalveolar lavage Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure whereby a small volume of fluid is put into the airways in order sample the cells and fluids of the aveoli and epithelium of the bronchi. BAL may be performed using a BAL tube, which allows fluid to be added to and removed from the bronchi, or may be performed during endoscopy, if the endoscope has an irrigation channel. To perform BAL, the horse is usually sedated, and local anaesthetic is usually instilled into the airways to reduce coughing. BAL is less useful when severe hemorrhage has occurred. BAL results only reflect the situation in the localized region of the lung which has been lavaged, and may not be representative of the whole lung. The fluid obtained by BAL is submitted for cytological examination. =Imaging= Radiography Imaging the lungs by taking a radiograph (x-ray) of the chest cannot be used to diagnose EIPH, as the lungs of affected and unaffected horses share the same characteristics. Pulmonary scintigraphy Scintigraphy of the lungs may detect moderate to severe alterations in the perfusion and possibly ventilation of the dorso-caudal lung. The use of radio-labelled red blood cells and scintigraphy to localise and or quantify hemorrhage is not useful due to general sequestration of labeled RBC by the lung, even in the absence of hemorrhage. =Post-mortem examination= EIPH seldom causes the death of a horse, but if an affected horse dies and undergoes a post-mortem examination, repeated episodes of EIPH will have caused a characteristic blue-gray-brown staining in the lungs. The staining is due to the presence of hemosiderin. The staining is usually most intense in the dorso-caudal region of the left and right diaphragmatic lobes which often progresses cranioventral with repetitive damage. There are often distinct borders between healthy lung tissue and those parts of the lungs that have been affected by EIPH. Other histopathologic findings include fibrosis, bronchial artery neovascularization, venous remodeling, bronchiolitis, hemosiderin accumulation, increased tissue cellularity (i.e. hemosiderophages), multifocal areas of inflammation, and increased thickness of vascular and airway walls. Causes EIPH occurs when blood enters the air passages of a horse's lung, due to fractured capillaries. A variety of causes have been proposed, but EIPH is most likely a multi-factorial condition, involving airway, vascular, inflammatory, blood, cardiac, locomotory, and remodelling components. The primary mechanism is likely to be high pulmonary vascular pressures with concurrent negative airway pressures, causing extreme stress across the pulmonary capillary membrane (the fragile membrane separating blood in the pulmonary capillaries from the air-filled alveoli) and consequent hemorrhage into the air spaces of the lung. Other contributing factors may include upper airway obstruction, increased blood viscosity, abnormalities of cardiac origin (small cross-sectional area of atrioventricular valves, stiff valves, slow left ventricular relaxation time, right tricuspid valve regurgitation), preferential distribution of blood flow to the dorsocaudal lung regions, mechanical trauma, lower airway obstruction, inflammation, abnormalities of blood coagulation, inhomogeneity of ventilation and locomotory trauma. EIPH begins in the dorso-caudal region of the lung and progresses in a cranioventral direction over time. =High pulmonary blood pressures= The most widely accepted theory is that high transmural pressures lead to pulmonary capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary capillary transmural pressure is determined by pulmonary capillary pressure and airway pressure. The horse has very high pulmonary vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 mmHg in the pulmonary artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls. Studies in vitro show that significant disruption of the pulmonary capillaries occurs at pressures of approximately 80 mmHg. In vivo, significant EIPH occurs above a mean pulmonary artery pressure of around 80‚Äì95 mmHg. On the basis of this theory, any factor or disease that would increase pulmonary vascular pressures (e.g. hypervolaemia) or increase the magnitude of the negative pressures in the lung during inspiration (e.g. dynamic upper airway obstruction) would increase the severity of EIPH; however neither experimentally induced laryngeal hemiplegia nor dorsal displacement of the soft palate increase pulmonary capillary transmural pressure. Furthermore, the magnitude of exercise-induced pulmonary arterial, capillary and venous hypertension is reportedly similar in horses either with or without EIPH. =Locomotory associated trauma= This theory is based on the fact that, during galloping, the absence of any bone attachment of the forelegs to the spine in the horse causes the shoulder to compress the cranial rib cage. The compression of the chest initiates a pressure wave of compression and expansion which spreads outwards. However, due to the shape of the lung and reflections off the chest wall, the wave of expansion and compression becomes focussed and amplified in the dorso-caudal lung. The alternate expansion and compression at the microscopic level in adjacent areas of lung tissue creates shear stress and capillary disruption. The theory predicts that hemorrhage would be more severe on hard track surfaces, but it does not explain why EIPH can occur in horses during swimming exercise. =Veno-occlusive remodelling= This theory proposes how high pulmonary venous pressures may lead to the capillary rupture and the tissue changes observed in EIPH. Regional veno- occlusive remodeling, especially within the caudodorsal lung fields, contributes to the pathogenesis of EIPH, with the venous remodeling leading to regional vascular congestion and hemorrhage, hemosiderin accumulation, fibrosis, and bronchial angiogenesis. =Risk factors= While all horses undertaking intense exercise experience some degree of EIPH, some horses consistently experience greater haemorrhage and other horses experience isolated episodes of increased EIPH. In the case of horses that consistently demonstrate greater severity of EIPH this is most likely due to congenital factors, such as very high pulmonary vascular pressures. In horses that experience isolated episodes of increased severity of EIPH, possible contributing factors may include, amongst others, pulmonary infection or atrial fibrillation, inflammation, longer distances, longer duration of exercise, hard surfaces, steeplechasing/hurdling, increased length of career, breed (i.e. Thoroughbred greater than Standardbred), time in training/racing, genetics, and cold temperatures. Management and treatment Furosemide (trade name: Lasix) administered prior to racing or strenuous exercise in Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses reduces the severity EIPH in 68% of horses. Up to 85% of Thoroughbred racehorses in the United States have been administered furosemide at least once during their racing career. Furosemide decreases pulmonary arterial pressure via its diuretic effects, bronchodilates, and redistributes blood flow during exercise. It reduces EIPH ranging from 90% at sub-maximal exercise and about 50% at maximal exercise intensities. However, over time, it causes electrolyte imbalances and has reduced effectiveness. Furosemide is prohibited in competing horses in some countries, and by the International Olympic Committee. The United States and Canada are the only countries which permit furosemide use during racing. Other vascular agents such as nitric oxide (NO), n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-Name), nitroglycerin, NO + phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), and endothelin receptor antagonists have no effect, and in some cases worsen of the EIPH. A non-pharmacological nasal strip, applied prophylactically, variably reduces EIPH, depending on the severity of EIPH in an individual horse, and the duration and intensity of the exercise bout. The strip minimizes the increase in resistance to breathing, and the work of breathing as exercise intensity increases. There is synergy with the nasal strip in combination with furosemide. The strip has a spring-like action that mechanically supports and maintains the size of the nasal passage at its narrowest part, the nasal valve. Resistance to breathing doubles during intense or long-duration endurance exercise, with >50% of the total resistance originating at the nasal passages. Decreased resistance reduces the airway forces across the pulmonary capillary membrane, reducing the EIPH. Use of the strip is permitted by the FEI, and in U.S. horse racing. Bronchodilatation is already maximized in the exercising horse, therefore bronchodilatory agents such as ipratropium, albuterol, or clenbuterol are not effective in reducing EIPH. Coagulation dysfunction is not a cause of EIPH, and anticoagulatory agents, including carbazochrome salicylate, aspirin, Premarin, Amicar, and vitamin K, are not effective in reducing EIPH, and in some cases may worsen it. Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA reduce EIPH, presumably via increasing the functionality of the white blood cells (WBCs) in removing the blood from the lungs. Concentrated equine serum reduced EIPH by 53% through a combined mechanism of a 30% reduction in inflammation and an increased functionality of the WBCs. Other anti-inflammatory agents, such as hesperidin-citrus bioflavinoids, vitamin C, NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone, corticosteroids, heated water vapor therapy, cromoglicic acid or nedocromil, have no beneficial effects in reducing EIPH severity. Phenylbutazone can partially reverse the beneficial effects of furosemide. Other ineffective treatments include leukocyte elastase protease inhibitors, the EIPH Patch, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, pentoxyfylline, guanabenz, clonidine, snake venom, and enalapril. Horses that undergo surgical correction for upper airway dysfunction are rested, and are under environmentally controlled environments with reduced dust may see some benefit.

Biography Born in 1945 in post-war Germany in the town of Falkenhagen, Deuter taught himself the guitar, flute, harmonica and \\"just about every instrument I could get my hands on,\\" though it wasn‚Äôt until after a near-fatal car crash in his early twenties that he decided to pursue a career in music. His first release in 1971, titled D, is widely acknowledged as a Krautrock classic. D marked the beginning of Deuter's spiritual and musical journey, ostensibly paving the way for a new genre of music known as New Age, which combined acoustic and electronic elements with ethnic instrumentation and nature sounds, such as whale and bird song, the open sea, wind in the trees, etc. During the 1970s and 1980s Deuter, after travelling extensively in Asia in search of spiritual and creative inspiration, settled for a long time in Pune, India, where under the name Chaitanya Hari he became a neo-sannyasin ‚Äî a disciple of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who later changed his name to Osho. With the aid of a multitrack tape machine, living in the neo-sannyas ashram, he produced a series of music tapes to be used in \\"active meditations\\", consisting of several \\"stages\\" of ten or fifteen minutes each, which range between, and often merge, Indian classical motifs, fiery drums, loops, synthesisers, bells, musique concr√®te and pastoral acoustic passages. These works were constructed to the master's instructions in consultation with a team of disciples testing the meditation methods. In the early 1990s, Deuter ‚Äî who always retained his professional name ‚Äî ended his long standing relationship with Kuckuck, the small record label that had released nearly 20 original Deuter albums in as many years, and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he signed a deal with New Earth Records, an independent label founded by fellow sannyasins Bhikkhu Schober and Waduda Paradiso. This proved to be a lucrative move for all involved, as Deuter's New Earth Records releases, the majority of them intended to accompany various healing and spiritual practices such as Reiki, massage and meditation or, in the case of Earth Blue (2003), a collaboration with the Autostadt Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, have sold well over half a million copies. Deuter has learned (and arguably mastered) an ever-expanding array of instruments, including the drums, the shakuhachi flute, the koto, sitar, Tibetan singing bowls, santoor, bouzouki, piano and keyboard. He has recorded and released over 60 albums and claims to have sold more than he can count during the course of his career. In 2016, Deuter's 2015 album Illumination of the Heart was voted among the top finalists for Album of the Year and Best Meditation/Relaxation Album by broadcasters and industry experts at Zone Music Reporter. In addition, Deuter received Zone Music Reporter's Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing his 40 years and more than 60 recordings of musical contribution to the New Age genre. Deuter's music features prominently in the 2019 American independent film Ham on Rye.

History The New Cathedral was originally the church of the Jesuit Formation house of Coimbra, established in the city in 1543. In 1759, the Jesuit Order was banned from Portugal by the Marquis of Pombal, Prime Minister of King Jos√© I. In 1772, the bishopric seat was transferred from the old Romanesque Cathedral of the city (now called the Old Cathedral of Coimbra) to the vacant, spacious and more modern Jesuit church.

Description The niches of the fa√ßade of the New Cathedral carry statues of four Jesuit saints. The Baroque decoration of the upper part of the fa√ßade, finished in the beginning of the 18th century, contrasts with the lower part, which follows a rigid Mannerist style. The church has two bell towers located just behind the main fa√ßade and a dome over the crossing.

Both transept arms and the main chapel of the apse are decorated with huge, magnificent gilt wood altarpieces built between the 17th and 18th centuries which are fine examples of the so-called \\"national\\" Portuguese altarpiece style. The lateral chapels of the nave have altarpieces in Mannerist and Baroque styles. The 17th-century choir stalls of the main chapel were brought from the Old Cathedral, as was the intricate stone baptismal font, carved by Pero and Felipe Henriques in late Gothic-Manueline style in the beginning of the 16th century.

History  Authorised by Parliament in August 1857 the line to Coniston was open less than two years later in June 1859. The station building was designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley in Swiss chalet style. The station was enlarged between 1888 and 1892 at a cost of over ¬£4,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The train shed was doubled in length and the goods shed was enlarged. A third platform was added in 1896 at a cost of ¬£750 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). There was a single track engine shed and a turntable south east of the station building. The shed was re-roofed by British Railways then closed when the station closed to passengers in 1958, but remained standing until the line and station were demolished in the 1960s. British Railways closed the station and the branch to passengers in 1958 and completely in 1962. The line's last fare-paying passengers are believed to be participants of the SLS/MLS Furness railtour of 27 August 1961. Services Railways in the area underwent a complex evolution with the development of Barrow-in-Furness in the second half of the nineteenth century. When Coniston Lake (as Coniston station was originally called) opened in 1858 Barrow was at its early stages of emergence as an industrial town, with Ulverston (then commonly written as \\"Ulverstone\\") remaining the local market town, as it had since the Middle Ages. The May 1865 Down (towards Coniston Lake) timetable shows three arrivals at Coniston Lake - morning midday and evening - from Monday to Saturday (the days are implied, not stated) with two on Sundays; all these trains travelled direct from Ulverstone, with connections shuttling between Barrow and Ulverstone along what was described as \\"The Barrow Branch.\\" By 1867 the pattern of provision had evolved so that most services shuttled along the branch to the to main line at , mostly making connections. The Barrow loop line opened in 1882, making travel easier between what by then was called plain \\"Coniston\\" and the growing centre of employment at Barrow, though the core pattern remained whereby branch trains connected at Foxfield. Physical, social and railway geography nevertheless made a poor mix. Ulverston market day was and remains on Thursdays. Ulverston is approximately twelve miles from Coniston by road, but over twentyseven miles by train via Barrow. Someone travelling on the market day extra from Coniston took 96 minutes to get to Ulverston, if all went well. This was an improvement in 1882, but a millstone when road travel improved in the following century. In Summer 1907 eight trains left Coniston for Foxfield Monday to Saturday, with three on Sundays. The Winter service was weaker - in 1910 five trains left Coniston (still listed as \\"Coniston Lake\\" in Bradshaw) for Foxfield, with two on Sundays. By the summer of 1922 nine trains left Coniston (no longer Coniston Lake, even in Bradshaw) daily, with four on Sundays. This weekday pattern continued until closure, though Sunday services were more variable, especially during the Second World War. Steam railcars were used for many years, but from 1950 if not earlier the core motive power was a push-pull set powered by a late-LMS 2-6-2T designed by Henry George Ivatt as in the photograph above. Great effort and money was expended on tourist services to Lakeside, but Coniston received much less attention in railway days and remains a relative backwater today. Few Special Trains travelled the branch and few Summer only trains reached Coniston from far away places. The exception which proved the rule was the Summer Tuesdays and Thursdays only service from Blackpool which survived until 1958, the line's last summer. In the 1930s the train also had a Summer Saturdays only variant which started at and returned to . This service was the only timetabled passenger train in BR days to travel direct between Dalton Junction and Park South, avoiding the long loop through Barrow. Two initiatives were introduced to encourage people to use the line, as opposed to special trains - Camping coaches and lake steamers. From 1934 a camping coach was placed at and three were positioned a short distance north of Coniston station on a siding off the branch to the Copperhouse. Campers were required to buy four adult returns from their home station. The Torver coach was not replaced after the Second World War, but those at Coniston were, 2 coaches were here in 1954 and three from 1955 until the end of the 1957 season. The steamer service was aimed at a socially select ridership, as underlined by its prices and literature. It was marketed as part of a suite of circular tours taking in trains, lake steamers, charabancs and sea-going paddle steamers across Morecambe Bay, suggestive of Grand Tours. The paddle steamer part of the tours was not revived after the First World War and Ribble buses replaced charabancs, but otherwise the core provision resumed after 1918 and continued until the outbreak of the Second World War, never to resume. Whilst this enterprise involved little investment in the railway it involved considerable investment by the Coniston and Furness Railways in the form of two steam vessels to ply the length of Coniston Water. The first was the Steam Yacht Gondola, launched in 1859, joined by Lady of the Lake in 1908. Lady of the Lake was scrapped in 1950 but Gondola has made a remarkable revival. She was still plying the lake in 2016. One aim in building the line was to carry copper ore from the mines above Coniston; ¬£20,000 of the ¬£45,000 risk capital raised by the technically independent Coniston Railway came from the copper mine owners and lessees. In the event the mine had passed its zenith when the line opened. What few records survive show that the copper tonnage carried was much less than the slate tonnage and both were on an altogether smaller scale than iron ore traffic in the area outside the line. The line's 1877 working timetable shows just one daily goods train and no mineral trains, though goods traffic was supplemented before the First World War by the routine running of mixed trains. One goods train per day became three per week in LMS days, remaining so until the line closed to all traffic in 1962. Demolition and afterlife The branch was lifted between April and November 1963, with most reusable materials being salvaged. Coniston station's footbridge was donated to the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway but the building was abandoned and left to decay until December 1968 when it was demolished by North Lonsdale Rural District Council's Roads Department. The site was later used for light industry and housing. See alsoList of non-ecclesiastical works by E. G.

He ruled the present-day Gujarat and surrounding areas, from his capital Anahilapataka (modern Patan). Karna succeeded his father Bhima I, who had invaded the Paramara kingdom of Malwa at the time of Bhoja's death. Karna was forced to retreat from Malwa by Bhoja's brother Udayaditya. He annexed Lata to the Chaulukya territory by defeating a Kalachuri general, but lost it within a few years. He also suffered a defeat against the Chahamanas of Naddula, who raided the Chaulukya capital during his reign. Karna is credited with defeating a Bhil chief of Ashapalli, and laying the foundation of the Karnavati city, identified with the modern Ahmedabad in western India. Karna married Mayanalladevi, who was the mother of his son and successor Jayasimha Siddharaja.  Early life  Karna was born to the Chaulukya monarch Bhima I and Queen Udayamati. According to the 12th century Jain chronicler Hemachandra, Bhima had three sons: Mularaja, Kshemaraja, and Karna. Mularaja died during Bhima's lifetime. Kshemaraja, the elder surviving son, renounced his rights to the throne, and retired to Dadhisthali as an ascetic. Bhima then placed Karna on the throne and retired. After becoming the king, Karna sent Kshemaraja's son Devaprasada to Dadisthali to take care of his father. The veracity of Hemachandra is doubtful, and is not corroborated by any historical evidence. The 14th century chronicler Merutunga states that Bhima's three sons were Mularaja, Karna and Haripala. Of these, Haripala was born of a concubine named Bakuladevi. According to historian A. K. Majumdar, Merutunga's account appears to be more satisfactory, since voluntary rejections of thrones were very rare. Karna may have banished his half-brother and nephew to eliminate any rival claimants to the throne. Hemachandra was a royal courtier of Karna's son Jayasimha Siddharaja as well Kumarapala (a descendant of Kshemaraja/Haripala). Therefore, he probably invented a fictional narrative to avoid mentioning Bhima's illegitimate son as an ancestor of his patron. This theory is corroborated by the fact that Jayasimha Siddharaja hated Kumarapala. Karna bore the title Trailokyamalla.  Military career  = Paramaras of Malwa = Karna was a contemporary of his Kalachuri namesake Karna (also known as Lakshmi-Karna). Karna's father Bhima I had formed an alliance with the Lakshmi-Karna to defeat the Paramaras of Malwa. The Paramara king Bhoja died as the alliance attacked Malwa, and a war of succession broke out between the Paramara relatives Jayasimha I and Udayaditya. Lakshmi-Karna seems to have occupied Malwa for sometime, but he soon suffered a series defeats against other neighbouring kings, and Bhima broke away from him. Udayaditya ultimately ascended the Paramara throne in Malwa. The Chaulukya inscriptions and chronicles claim that Karna defeated the new Paramara king. An inscription from Kumarapala's reign states that Karna defeated the Malwa monarch at the Sudakupa pass. The Gujarat chronicler Arisimha claims that Karna brought a statue of Nilakantha to Gujarat as a result of his victory against the Malwa ruler. Another Gujarat poet Someshvara claims that Karna overran Malwa, and the Paramara priest magically invoked an evil spirit to defeat him. However, Karna's priest Ama (who was an ancestor of Someshvara), turned this evil spirit against the Paramara priest, who was killed as a result. The non-Chaulukya records, on the other hand, suggest that Udayaditya defeated Karna. According to the Paramara inscriptions, Udayaditya defeated three kings to ascend the Paramara throne. One of these three kings was Karna, who is identified with the Chaulukya king. Chahamana chronicle Prithviraja Vijaya states that the Chahamana king Vigraharaja III gave a horse named Saranga to Udayaditya, with whose help Udayaditya defeated Karna. The text specifically mentions Karna as \\"Gurjara\\", that is the ruler of the Gurjara region. The Jainad inscription of Udayaditya's son Jagaddeva also mentions that he subdued Karna, and made the wives of the Gurjara warriors cry. These evidences indicate that the Paramara claims of victory over Karna pertain to the Chaulukya Karna (and not the Kalachuri Karna). These opposing claims indicate that Karna defeated Udayaditya at first, but then Udayaditya was able to defeat him and ascend the throne of Malwa with Chahamana support. Udayaditya's son Jagaddeva seems to have accompanied his father in the battle against Karna. = Kalachuris of Tripuri = After the death of the Paramara king Bhoja, the Kalachuris of Tripuri briefly occupied Malwa. The Kalachuri general Vapullaka also conquered the Lata region (present-day south Gujarat), which was located between the Chaulukya and the Paramara kingdoms. By 1074 CE, Lata was under Chaulukya control, as attested by one of Karna's Navsari inscription. Thus, it appears that Karna expelled the Kalachuris from Lata, and annexed the region to the Chaulukya kingdom. Karna's victory appears to have been achieved during the reign of the Kalachuri king Yashah-Karna, as suggested by a verse of the Gujarat poet Someshvara. This verse talks about how the rivalry between the legendary heroes Karna and Arjuna resulted in Arjuna's yashah (fame) being driven away. It appears that Karna lost Lata to one Trivikramapala within three years, but the region was recaptured by his son Jayasimha Siddharaja. = Other campaigns = The Chahamanas of Naddula invaded the Chaulukya kingdom during Karna's reign. According to their Sundha Hill inscription, the Chahamana ruler Prithvipala defeated Karna, and his successor Jojalladeva occupied the Chaulukya capital Anahilapataka by force. It is possible that the Naddula Chahamanas raided the Chaulukya capital while Karna was busy at another place. According to a Ras-Mala account based on the writings of the 14th century chronicler Merutunga, Karna defeated the Bhils and the Kolis. The two tribes lived between the Rann of Kutch and the Sabarmati River, and plundered the Chaulukya territories. As a result, Karna led a series of expeditions against them. In one such campaign, he defeated a Bhil chief named Asha (ƒÄ≈õƒÅ), who lived at Ashapalli. According to Merutunga, Karna established the city of Karnavati after this victory. Karnavati is identified with modern Ahmedabad by some, but this is not certain. Bilhana's poem Karna-Sundari, which presents Karna as a hero, claims that he conquered Sindh. But this claim is historically inaccurate. Two relatively late texts suggest that Karna was defeated by the Chahamana king Durlabharaja III. The 14th century text Prabandha Kosha claims that Durlabha defeated the Gurjara king, brought him to the Chahamana capital Ajmer in chains and forced him to sell yogurt in a market. The 15th century Hammira Mahakavya claims that Karna was killed in a battle against Durlabha. However, this claim is historically inaccurate: Durlabha died around 1070 CE, while Karna lived until 1092 CE. Moreover, the earlier Chahamana records (such as Prithviraja Vijaya) do not mention any such conflict. It is possible that Durlabha achieved a minor military success against Karna, which was magnified into a major victory by the later panegyrists.  Personal life  Karna married Mayanalla, a daughter of the Kadamba king Jayakeshi I (r. c. 1050‚Äì1080). The various legends provide contradictory accounts of how this marriage happened. According to Hemachandra's 12th century Dvyashraya, Mayanalla was an extremely beautiful Kadamba princess. She once saw Karna's painting by a Buddhist artist. Enamoured by Karna's looks, she rejected all other suitors, and resolved to marry him. With the approval of her father Jayakeshi, she sent an artist to Karna's court with her own portrait. The Kadamba king also sent gifts for Karna, including an elephant. When Karna went out in the garden to check out the gifted elephant, he found the princess waiting for him. He verified her identity by asking certain questions, and then married her. According to Merutunga's 14th century Prabandha-Chintamani, Mayanalla-devi was an ugly princess of Karnata. One day, she remembered her past life. In that past life, she was a devout Shaivite, who had planned to visit the Somanath temple in Gujarat. However, she was stopped at Bahuloda for being unable to pay a pilgrim tax imposed by the rulers of Gujarat. When Mayanalla recalled this incident from her past life, she decided to marry the king of Gujarat and waive this unfair tax. At her insistence, her father Jayakeshi sent a marriage proposal to Karna, but Karna rejected the ugly princess. Mayanalla then came to Karna's court with her eight female companions, and threatened to commit suicide. Karna still refused to marry her, but unable to witness their deaths, Karna's mother Udayamati declared that she would die with the girls. As a result, Karna had to relent. He married Mayanalla, but kept neglecting her. Ultimately, she was able to win him over with help of a minister. Later, she convinced their son Jayasimha Siddharaja to waive the pilgrim tax. This is also attested by another chronicler. The Kashmiri poet Bilhana also appears to allude to this incident. He stayed at Karna's court for sometime, and composed the poetic drama Karna-Sundari, which presents Karna as a hero. According to this work, Karna dreamt of the princess (called Karnasundari, or \\"Karna's beautiful woman\\"), and decided to marry her. His jealous queen attempted to get him married to a boy disguised in Karnasundari's dress. However, Karna's clever minister foiled her plan by replacing the boy with the real Karnasundari. Although Bilhana was a contemporary of Karna, his account is the least accurate one, because it is intended to be a drama. Nevertheless, his account is helpful in estimating the date of this marriage. Bilhana probably left Karna's court somewhere between 1072 and 1078 CE. Assuming that Karnasundari is same as Mayanalla, Karna's marriage to her would have taken place sometime before this. It is difficult to determine whether Mayanalla was beautiful (as claimed by Hemachandra and Bilhana), or ugly (as claimed by Merutunga). Both Hemachandra and Bilhana wrote under Chaulukya patronage, so they had a vested interest in portraying Karna's queen in a positive light. Merutunga was not under any such pressure, but his account is fanciful and full of historical inaccuracies. For example, he claims that Jayakeshi's father was Shubhakeshi (it was actually Shashthi II). Merutunga further provides an absurd account of how Shubhakeshi chose to die with a tree in a wildfire, because he was grateful to the tree for having given him shade during a journey.

According to the 14th century chronicler Merutunga, he built a temple dedicated to the goddess Kochharba at Ashapalli after defeating its Bhil chief Asha. He also established the Karnavati city nearby, where he commissioned the Karneshvara and Jayantidevi temples. He also built the Karnasagara tank at Modhera and Karnavati. In his capital Anahilapataka (now Patan), he erected the Karnameru temple. He is also ascribed a vapi at Bhadravati (Bhadreshwar). According to Hemachandra, Karna repaired a temple of the goddess Lakshmi, and prayed her for a son; as a result of the Lakshmi's blessings, Jayasimha Siddharaja was born to him. His minister Shantu built Shantu Vasatika at Karnavati, Patan, Vanka and Nihala. His another minister Munjala built Munjala Vasati at Patan somewhere before 1900 CE. Saliga Jinalaya or Sagal Vasatika was built in Khambhat before 1094 CE. None of these temples survives. According to Bhaktamara-stotra-vritti, Shreshthi Chanaka built Adinath temple at Patan. Minister Dhavala, nephew of Vimala, constructed Revanta-prasada. Vayatiya Vasati at Ashapalli probably constructed in early years of Karna, existed before Udayana arrived there. Udayana-vihaea in Karnavati was completed in 1093 CE. The temple is discussed in Mahendrasuri's Vadasthala and its rejoiner Prabodhyavadasthala by Jinapatisuri as it had raised controversies in 1192 regarding its sanctity due to its consecration by a Chaityavasi abbot. Based on style-critical analysis, the rangamandapa and torana at Sun Temple, Modhera is ascribed the early years of Karna's reign. The extant temples built during this period include the Brahma temple at Khedbrahma, the Limboji Mata temple at Delmal, Nilkantha Mahadev temple at Sunak, the completely ruined Vishnu Temple on the bank of lake at Ganja, Dugdheshwara Mahadev temple at Madrodpur in Kheralu Taluka of Mehsana district. Shantinatha Jain temple of the group of temples at Kumbhariya belongs to this period. Lakulisha Temple at Pavagadh is styalistically attributed to this period. Karna was also tolerant towards Jainism, as evident from Rajashekhara's 15th century commentary on Sridhara's Nyaya-Kandali. One legend claims that as Karna became a disciple of Vardhamana Suri, but this is historically inaccurate since Vardhamana Suri had starved himself to death at an earlier date. In popular culture The story of Karandev (Karna), Minaldevi (Mayanalla) and their son Siddhraj (Jayasimha Siddharaja) is depicted in the Gujarati historical fiction Patan ni Prabhuta (The Glory of Patan) by Kanhaiyalal Munshi.

Population: History Nikolo-Medvedsky Monastery in Novaya Ladoga (1911 photo) The Nikolo-Medvedsky (St. Nicholas) Monastery stood on the site of the modern town since the 15th century, but the nearby sloboda was long overshadowed by the first Russian capital, Staraya Ladoga, located just a few miles upstream. In 1702‚Äì1704, during the Great Northern War, Peter the Great established a shipyard there, fortified the monastery, and ordered the population of Staraya Ladoga to relocate to the nearby village. Town rights were granted to it in 1704. The newly founded town grew in importance in connection with construction of the Ladoga Canal and Volga-Baltic Waterway in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1719, Novaya Ladoga was included to St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1773 Novoladozhsky Uyezd, with its seat in Novaya Ladoga, was established. In 1776, the area was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty and in 1781, it was moved back into St. Petersburg Governorate. On December 9, 1922, the administrative center of the uyezd was moved to the selo of Gostinopolye, which was renamed Volkhov and was granted town status. The uyezd was renamed Volkhovsky. In 1924, the changes were rolled back, the administrative center moved to Novaya Ladoga, and Volkhov was demoted to a selo (which was eventually renamed Gostinopolye). The name of the uyezd, however, remained Volkhovsky. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Volkhovsky District, with the administrative center in the urban-type settlement of Zvanka, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On March 20, 1946, Novoladozhsky District with the administrative center located in Novaya Ladoga was split off Volkhovsky District. On February 1, 1963, Novoladozhsky District was abolished and merged into Volkhovsky District. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated within Volkhovsky District as Novoladozhskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.Oblast Law #32-oz As a municipal division, Novoladozhskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Volkhovsky Municipal District as Novoladozhskoye Urban Settlement.Law #56-oz Economy =Industry= Industrial facilities in Novaya Ladoga include shipyards and food industry enterprises. =Transportation= Old Ladoga Canal in Novaya Ladoga The M18 Highway, connecting St. Petersburg and Murmansk, passes close to Novaya Ladoga. In Kiselnya, close to Novaya Ladoga, a highway heading to Vologda via Tikhvin and Cherepovets branches off. The town is also connected by a road to Volkhov, with a regular bus traffic. The Volkhov River is navigable within the district; however, there is no passenger navigation. In the beginning of the 19th century, a system of canals bypassing Lake Ladoga were built, which at the time were a part of Mariinsky Water System, connecting the Neva River and the Volga River. In particular, the Syas Canal connects the Syas and the Volkhov. The New Ladoga Canal connects the Volkhov and the Neva. It replaced the Old Ladoga Canal, built by Peter the Great, which thus became disused and decayed. The canals collectively are known as the Ladoga Canal. Culture and recreation The trading arcades The district contains seven cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally five objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are the trading arcades, the Nikolo- Medvedsky Monastery, the monument erected to commemorate the opening of the Ladoga Canal, as well as two buildings related to the activities of Alexander Suvorov, who was a regiment commander in Novaya Ladoga, and the building hosted the headquarters of the Ladoga Military Flotilla during World War II.

The vessel was converted to a museum ship in 1989 and located in Paris. Description Designated \\"hunter submarines\\" () by the French Navy the Ar√©thuse class were designed as attack submarines specifically for operations in the Mediterranean Sea. The design retained a small silhouette and great manoeverability. They had a standard displacement of , surfaced and submerged. Argonaute is long with a beam of and a draught of . The Ar√©thuse class were the first French submarines to use a diesel-electric propulsion system and were powered by two 12-cylinder SEMT Pielstick diesel engines driving one shaft rated at surfaced. They also mounted two electric generators that produced connected to one electric motor for use while submerged rated at . The generators were placed on spring suspensions and the motor was attached directly to the shaft creating a near-silent operational environment while submerged. Argonaute had a maximum speed of surfaced and submerged. Argonaute was armed with four torpedo tubes in the bow for four torpedoes. The submarine carried four reloads. The class was designed primarily for anti-submarine warfare. Argonaute was initially equipped with DUUA I sonar. The Ar√©thuse- class submarines had a complement of 40 including 6 officers. By 1981, Argonautes sonar had been upgraded to one active DUUA II sonar, one passive DUUA II sonar, one passive ranging DUUX 2 sonar. The submarine had a diving depth down to roughly . Service history Argonaute, were ordered as part of the 1953 construction programme. The submarine was constructed at the Arsenal de Cherbourg in Cherbourg, France and was laid down in March 1955. The submarine was launched on 29 June 1957 and commissioned on 11 February 1959. Argonaute operated exclusively in the Mediterranean Sea as a deterrent against threats to commercial shipping between France and its colonies in North Africa. Argonaute was taken out of service and placed in reserve in 1982. Museum ship In 1982, the Association of Friends of the Maritime Museum for the Atlantic () selected Argonaute to save from scrapping. The Minister of Defence, Charles Hernu, agreed to save the submarine in 1984 after it was to become part of a permanent exhibition devoted to history of submarines and the technologies used in their construction at Cit√© des sciences et de l'industrie in La Villette Park, Paris. Argonaute, in reserve since 1982, was transported in 1989 on a barge, itself pulled by a tug, which arrived in Le Havre three weeks later via Gibraltar. The barge then went up the Seine to Gennevilliers where a dozen float balloons were added to raise the draught of the barge. Then the barge passed through the seven locks of the Saint-Denis Canal. Once at the quay on the Canal de l'Ourcq, Argonaute was lifted from the water by cranes and transported by trailer to its current site. Argonaute opened to the public in 1991, outside the Cit√© des sciences et de l'industrie, 30 Avenue Corentin Cariou, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. In 2018, the permanent exhibition underwent an overhaul to include information about the future of the oceans.

BB&CI; completed the work in 1864. The first suburban railway in India was started by BB&CI;, operating between Virar and Churchgate (later extended to Colaba), a railway station in Bombay Backbay in April 1867. The railway was divided into two main systems, broad (5 ft. 6 in.) and metre gauge. There was also a comparatively small mileage of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge line worked by the BB&CI; on behalf of the Indian States. In 1947 the mileage of the respective portions was stated to be: broad gauge, 1,198 miles, with a further 69 miles worked for Indian States; metre gauge, 1,879 miles, with a further 106 miles worked for Indian States; narrow- gauge, 152 miles, worked for Indian States and various companies. Quadruple track mileage was 22 and double-track 250, the remainder of the system being single-track, whilst running powers were exercised over 147 miles (including the important section from Muttra Junction to Delhi, owned by the Great Indian Peninsular Railway).Article by H.C. Towers in The Railway Magazine, vol. 93, no. 568, March and April, 1947 The main headquarters of the BB&CI; Railway was located at Churchgate, Bombay and the headquarters and workshops for the metre gauge tracks and services was located in Ajmer.  Description of systems  The broad-gauge main line ran northwards from Bombay to Baroda, where it bifurcated, the north-east main line continuing towards Delhi, and the north- west main line to the industrial city of Ahmedabad and onwards to Viramgam and Kharagoda. The north-east main line passed through Godhra, Ratlam, Kotah and Bayana (from where a branch line ran to Agra Fort), to Muttra Junction, where it joined the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, over which it had running powers for 90 miles into Delhi. The metre-gauge system was originally the Rajputana Malwa State Railway. It began at Ahmedabad and ran northwards through Baroda State and Rajputana via Abu, Ajmer, Jaipur and Rewari to Delhi. There were branches from Rewari to Bhatinda and Fazilka, from Ajmer to Ratlam, Indore and Khandwa, and from Achnera to Cawnpore.Towers, ibid.  Organisation  The original Bombay, Baroda & Central India Railway Company was purchased by the Government of India in 1905, but continued to be worked by a company with a board of directors in London until 1 January 1942, on which date the working was taken over by the government and it became part of the Indian State Railway system, directly under the Railway Board.Towers, ibid.  Construction and Opening  The section from Churchgate to Ahmedabad was opened in stages between 1860 and 1870. The original Bombay terminus was at Grant Road, subsequently extended to Churchgate in 1870 and to Colaba, at the southern tip of the island of Bombay, in 1873. After the new Bombay Central station was opened in 1930, the line between Churchgate and Colaba was closed and removed. The section from Godhra to Nagda was opened in 1896 and extended to Baroda. Nagda to Muttra Junction was opened in 1909, making possible through broad-gauge running between Bombay and Delhi. The metre-gauge system was originally the Rajputana Malwa State Railway and was taken over subsequently by the BB&CI.; The metre-gauge main line from Delhi to Jaipur was completed in 1874, extended to Ajmer in 1875 and to Ahmedabad in 1881.Towers, ibid. The branch from Rewari to Bhatinda and Fazilka was begun in 1881 by the Ferozepore & Rewari Railway, but the section between Bhatinda and Ferozepore was subsequently built to the broad-gauge and passed to the GIPR.  Electrification  The Colaba-Borivali section (37.8 km) was electrified on 5 January 1928 on the 1.5 kV DC system. The two tracks between Colaba and Grant Road stations were electrified, while four tracks between Grant Road and Bandra railway stations were electrified. Only two suburban tracks between Bandra and Borivali were electrified in 1928, two main tracks were left for the steam locomotives. In 1933, Colaba railway station and two electrified tracks between Colaba and Churchgate railway stations were dismantled. In 1936, electrification was extended to the two main tracks between Bandra and Borivali railway stations, left earlier and the two main tracks between Borivali and Virar railway stations were also electrified, resulting in completion of the electrification of the Churchgate-Virar section.Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, pp.150-1  Locomotives and Rolling Stock  In 1947, the total numbers of broad-gauge locomotives in service were 363 steam, 10 diesel and 2 electric. There were 1,042 passenger coaches (including 40 electric motor and 120 electric trailer coaches) and 10,584 goods wagons. The equivalent figures for the metre-gauge were 437 locomotives, 1,335 coaches, 3 Sentinel steam coaches, and 9,127 wagons. On the 2 ft. 6 in. gauge there were 20 locomotives, 58 coaches and 259 wagons.All figures quoted by Towers, ibid.  Later developments  In 1949, after independence of India, Gaekwar's Baroda State Railway was merged in to Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway by Government of India. On 5 November 1951 the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway was merged with the Saurashtra Railway, Rajputana Railway, Jaipur State Railway and Cutch State Railway to give rise to the Western Railway.

History =1940s and 1950s= The first Sportsgirl store opened in 1948 as an alternative to its sister label Sportscraft on Swanston Street, Melbourne. The store was owned and operated by the Bardas family, who until then had no retail outlet and had been distributing their Sportscraft clothing label via department stores. In 1956, the rent on their initial property was raised (potentially due to Melbourne being host to the 1956 Summer Olympics). The Bardas family, therefore, decided to move their store to Collins Street. They would eventually purchase this property in 1959, cementing it as the flagship store for the brand as they expanded throughout the metropolitan area. =1960s= In the 1960s, Sportsgirl emerged as a leader in the Australian fashion industry, including opening a Sydney flagship store on Pitt Street, successfully developing a brand image and a store identity that moved fashion retail away from the concept of established department stores to the concept of the lifestyle fashion boutique, using interior design, visual merchandising, graphic design, and advertising to build its fashion brand into one that appealed to the emerging youth market of the 1960s. As well as carefully choosing overseas imports, Sportsgirl sourced its fashion lines from young Australian designers, employing heavy use of print advertising and merchandising display to create a Sportsgirl identity that linked its clothing lines to a set of lifestyle values and accessories. =1970s= In the 1970s, Sportsgirl continued opening stores in locations throughout Australia. It continued its heavy use of mass advertising through print and media advertising that linked fashion with lifestyle images. Sportsgirl adopts the developing methods of mass marketing. It capitalizes on the power of linking fashion with exciting images. Sportsgirl advertising campaigns and its in-store magazines combine attention-grabbing photography with memorable slogans and lifestyle concepts. Sportsgirl uses special events, in-store parades, and promotions to pump excitement into fashion. Internationally acclaimed illustrator Antonio was brought to Australia by Sportsgirl, who used his drawings to promote a parade held in two circus tents. Make-up artists Way Bandy and Regis are brought to Australia to give public demonstrations of the latest fashion looks. Sportsgirl blazes through as one of the first fashion retailers to sell homewares and body and beauty products. =1980s= By the 1980s, Sportsgirl had over 100 stores throughout Australia. Frontline (not to be confused with the television series of the same name) was launched as Sportsgirl's very own magazine. The Melbourne and Sydney flagship stores opened their own in-store cafes. Healthworks cafes opened in Melbourne and Sydney flagship stores. Sportsgirl picked up on the concept of Lifestyle and had in-store cafes long before other retailers. Flagship stores included an in-store travel club. Sportsgirl cosmetics and perfumes are launched. Sportsgirl stocks fledgling Australian designers and labels. Many of them go on to become fashion industry stars including Prue Acton, Trent Nathan, Norma Tullo, Simona, and Country Road. Many Sportsgirl employees go on to make their own mark within the industry, such as Craig Kimberley, founder of Just Jeans. A department within Sportsgirl called Bigi the hottest in young fashion, especially in evening wear. Bigi was inspired by a line Bergdorf Goodman, the famous US department store, carries. Many label subsidiaries to Sportsgirl are launched, including David Lawrence, Elle B, SG Essentials, Metro, Bush Telegraph. The Sportsgirl network is wide in Australia with over 100 stores. =1990s= A Sportsgirl outlet on Murray Street, Hobart CBD. In 1991, Sportsgirl opened ($180 million) Sportsgirl Centre in Collins Street. In Melbourne 1994, a change in the economic climate forces the company to sell the Sportsgirl Centre. David Bardas left the company and it was sold to an alliance of South African company Truworths and Australian Frank Whitford, managing director of Sportsgirl. Stores are opened in New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand. Expansion continues despite difficult retailing conditions. Labels Sportscraft, Sportsgirl, and David Lawrence are split into separate stores, and new store fit-outs are implemented across Australia. Substantial investment is made in developing the profiles of the individual brands. Sportsgirl lures supermodel Claudia Schiffer to appear in the Sportsgirl parade at the Melbourne Fashion Festival. In early 1999, Whitford's offer to buy out Truworths failed and in late 1999 the Sportsgirl Sportscraft Group was sold. =2000s= A Sportsgirl outlet within the Eastland Shopping Centre, Ringwood, in eastern Melbourne. In 2000 and under new management by the Sussan Corporation, Sportsgirl launched a new look for its stores, with the first unveiled at the Chadstone shopping center in Melbourne. Sportsgirl launches its new connection campaign \\"make your own way there\\" ditching the traditional ‚Äòideal women‚Äô image for real and risqu√© images including tattoos, naked women on horseback, and women kissing. A revamped and irreverent Sportsgirl website experience is shared onto the Internet. In 2007, Sportsgirl launched its rewind range. It brought back some of its older pieces from the 1980s, such as the Sportsgirl logo tee, beach towels, and duffel bags. In 2009, Sportsgirl launched the label 'Romance Was Born' in stores featuring music from the Melbourne indie/electro band Neon Knights. In 2012, Sportsgirl displayed the \\"window shop\\", a digital strategy to allow for 24/7 shopping. In this concept, products are displayed on the shopfront's windows, and customers can scan the products QR code with their smartphone or iPad to make an immediate purchase.

Different geographic regions of West Bengal have subtle as well as more pronounced variations between each other, with Darjeeling Himalayan hill region and Duars showing particularly different socio-cultural aspects. West Bengal's capital Kolkata‚Äîas the former capital of India‚Äîwas the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought, and is referred to as the \\"cultural [or literary] capital of India\\". The presence of paras, which are cluster of neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of West Bengal. Typically, each para has its own community club and, on occasion, a playing field. Residents engage in addas, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation. However, with the growth of apartments, expansion of neighbourhoods and rapid urbanization, this culture is on decline. Literature The Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage, shared with neighbouring Bangladesh. West Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the Charyapada, Mangalkavya, Shreekrishna Kirtana, Thakurmar Jhuli, and stories related to Gopal Bhar. In the nineteenth and twentieth century, Bengali literature was modernized in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Coupled with social reforms led by Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, and others, this constituted a major part of the Bengal Renaissance. cited in The middle and latter parts of the 20th century witnessed the arrival of post-modernism, as well as literary movements such as those espoused by the Kallol movement, hungryalists and the little magazines. Theater and films Among other types of theater, West Bengal has a tradition of folk drama known as jatra. Kolkata is the home of the Bengali cinema industry, dubbed \\"Tollywood\\" for Tollygunj, where most of the state's film studios are located.. Its long tradition of art films includes globally acclaimed film directors such as Academy Award-winning director Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha, and contemporary directors such as Aparna Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Goutam Ghose, Koushik Ganguly, Rituparno Ghosh, Anjan Dutt, Nandita Roy, Shiboprosad Mukherjee and Srijit Mukherji. The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata Music The Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has also been influenced by regional music traditions. Other folk music forms include Kabigaan, Gombhira, Bhawaiya, kirtans, and Gajan festival music. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. The state is recognised for its appreciation of rabindrasangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music. Nazrul Geeti is another classical music of Bengal, which is written and composed by poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. He was person in Bengal music who created the first Bengali ghazals. Popular music genres include adhunik songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk‚Äìrock Bengali bands. Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan (\\"songs about life\\"), is based on realism. UNESCO selected The Rural Craft Hub of Bengal to showcase their artwork in Paris in 2015. Attire Though Bengali women traditionally wear the sari and shalwar kameez, Western attire has gained acceptance among younger and professional women. Western-style dress has greater acceptance among men, although the traditional costumes like dhoti, panjabi, kurta, sherwani, pyjama and lungi are seen during weddings and major festivals. Like any other metropolis, Kolkata also has an eclectic mix of western wears with a tinge of ethnic wears. People are found dressed in jeans along with kurtas, or sari along with an overcoat. Festivals and celebrations West Bengal is famous for its culture and festivals are an inevitable part of this culture. People of different religions and communities perform their religious rituals with festivities. Some festivals are celebrated statewide, while others are local in nature. There are also various other village fairs and seasonal tribal festivals. Durga Puja is the biggest and most important festival of West Bengal, and it features colourful pandals, decorative idols of Hindu goddess Durga and her family, lighting decoration and immersion processions. Other major festivals are Kali Puja, Diwali, Holi, Saraswati Puja, Jagaddhatri Puja, Rath Jatra, Kojagori Lakshmi Puja, Vishwakarma Puja, Poush Parbon, Poila Boishakh, Eid, Muharram, Christmas etc. Kolkata Book Fair, Kolkata International Film Festival and Dover Lane Music Festival are major annual cultural events of Kolkata, whereas Poush Mela, Ganga Sagar Mela, Jhapan are some of the major annual fairs of the state.

According to proponents of inflation theory, during the inflationary epoch about 10‚àí32 of a second after the Big Bang, the universe suddenly expanded, and its volume increased by a factor of at least 1078 (an expansion of distance by a factor of at least 1026 in each of the three dimensions), equivalent to expanding an object 1 nanometer (10‚àí9 m, about half the width of a molecule of DNA) in length to one approximately 10.6 light years (about 1017 m or 62 trillion miles) long. A much slower and gradual expansion of space continued after this, until at around 9.8 billion years after the Big Bang (4 billion years ago) it began to gradually expand more quickly, and is still doing so. The metric expansion of space is of a kind completely different from the expansions and explosions seen in daily life. It also seems to be a property of the universe as a whole rather than a phenomenon that applies just to one part of the universe or can be observed from \\"outside\\" of it. Metric expansion is a key feature of Big Bang cosmology, is modeled mathematically with the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker metric and is a generic property of the universe we inhabit. However, the model is valid only on large scales (roughly the scale of galaxy clusters and above), because gravitational attraction binds matter together strongly enough that metric expansion cannot be observed on a smaller scale at this time. As such, the only galaxies receding from one another as a result of metric expansion are those separated by cosmologically relevant scales larger than the length scales associated with the gravitational collapse that are possible in the age of the universe given the matter density and average expansion rate. Physicists have postulated the existence of dark energy, appearing as a cosmological constant in the simplest gravitational models, as a way to explain the acceleration. According to the simplest extrapolation of the currently-favored cosmological model, the Lambda-CDM model, this acceleration becomes more dominant into the future. In June 2016, NASA and ESA scientists reported that the universe was found to be expanding 5% to 9% faster than thought earlier, based on studies using the Hubble Space Telescope. While special relativity prohibits objects from moving faster than light with respect to a local reference frame where spacetime can be treated as flat and unchanging, it does not apply to situations where spacetime curvature or evolution in time become important. These situations are described by general relativity, which allows the separation between two distant objects to increase faster than the speed of light, although the definition of \\"separation\\" is different from that used in an inertial frame. This can be seen when observing distant galaxies more than the Hubble radius away from us (approximately 4.5 gigaparsecs or 14.7 billion light-years); these galaxies have a recession speed that is faster than the speed of light. Light that is emitted today from galaxies beyond the cosmological event horizon, about 5 gigaparsecs or 16 billion light-years, will never reach us, although we can still see the light that these galaxies emitted in the past. Because of the high rate of expansion, it is also possible for a distance between two objects to be greater than the value calculated by multiplying the speed of light by the age of the universe. These details are a frequent source of confusion among amateurs and even professional physicists.Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the universe. astro-ph/0310808 Due to the non-intuitive nature of the subject and what has been described by some as \\"careless\\" choices of wording, certain descriptions of the metric expansion of space and the misconceptions to which such descriptions can lead are an ongoing subject of discussion within the fields of education and communication of scientific concepts. History In 1912, Vesto Slipher discovered that light from remote galaxies was redshifted, which was later interpreted as galaxies receding from the Earth. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann used Einstein field equations to provide theoretical evidence that the universe is expanding. Translated in In 1927, Georges Lema√Ætre independently reached a similar conclusion to Friedmann on a theoretical basis, and also presented the first observational evidence for a linear relationship between distance to galaxies and their recessional velocity.Georges Lema√Ætre, 'Un Univers homog√®ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n√©buleuses extra-galactiques, Annales de la Soci√©t√© Scientifique de Bruxelles, A47, p. 49-59, 1927 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1927ASSB...47...49L Edwin Hubble observationally confirmed Lema√Ætre's findings two years later. Assuming the cosmological principle, these findings would imply that all galaxies are moving away from each other. Based on large quantities of experimental observation and theoretical work, the scientific consensus is that space itself is expanding, and that it expanded very rapidly within the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This kind of expansion is known as \\"metric expansion\\". In mathematics and physics, a \\"metric\\" means a measure of distance, and the term implies that the sense of distance within the universe is itself changing.  Cosmic inflation  The modern explanation for the metric expansion of space was proposed by physicist Alan Guth in 1979 while investigating the problem of why no magnetic monopoles are seen today. Guth found in his investigation that if the universe contained a field that has a positive-energy false vacuum state, then according to general relativity it would generate an exponential expansion of space. It was very quickly realized that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look as it does today, the universe would have to have started from very finely tuned, or \\"special\\" initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation theory largely resolves these problems as well, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of Big Bang theory. According to Roger Penrose, inflation does not solve the main problem it was supposed to solve, namely the incredibly low entropy (with unlikeliness of the state on the order of 1/1010128 ‚Å†) of the early Universe contained in the gravitational conformal degrees of freedom (in contrast to fields degrees of freedom, such like the cosmic microwave background whose smoothness can be explained by inflation). Thus, he puts forward his scenario of the evolution of the Universe: conformal cyclic cosmology. No field responsible for cosmic inflation has been discovered. However such a field, if found in the future, would be scalar. The first similar scalar field proven to exist was only discovered in 2012 - 2013 and is still being researched. So it is not seen as problematic that a field responsible for cosmic inflation and the metric expansion of space has not yet been discovered. The proposed field and its quanta (the subatomic particles related to it) have been named inflaton. If this field did not exist, scientists would have to propose a different explanation for all the observations that strongly suggest a metric expansion of space has occurred, and is still occurring much more slowly today. Overview of metrics and comoving coordinates To understand the metric expansion of the universe, it is helpful to discuss briefly what a metric is, and how metric expansion works. A metric defines the concept of distance, by stating in mathematical terms how distances between two nearby points in space are measured, in terms of the coordinate system. Coordinate systems locate points in a space (of whatever number of dimensions) by assigning unique positions on a grid, known as coordinates, to each point. Latitude and longitude, and x-y graphs are common examples of coordinates. A metric is a formula which describes how a number known as \\"distance\\" is to be measured between two points. It may seem obvious that distance is measured by a straight line, but in many cases it is not. For example, long haul aircraft travel along a curve known as a \\"great circle\\" and not a straight line, because that is a better metric for air travel. (A straight line would go through the earth). Another example is planning a car journey, where one might want the shortest journey in terms of travel time - in that case a straight line is a poor choice of metric because the shortest distance by road is not normally a straight line, and even the path nearest to a straight line will not necessarily be the quickest. A final example is the internet, where even for nearby towns, the quickest route for data can be via major connections that go across the country and back again. In this case the metric used will be the shortest time that data takes to travel between two points on the network. In cosmology, we cannot use a ruler to measure metric expansion, because our ruler's internal forces easily overcome the extremely slow expansion of space, leaving the ruler intact. Also, any objects on or near earth that we might measure are being held together or pushed apart by several forces which are far larger in their effects. So even if we could measure the tiny expansion that is still happening, we would not notice the change on a small scale or in everyday life. On a large intergalactic scale, we can use other tests of distance and these do show that space is expanding, even if a ruler on earth could not measure it. The metric expansion of space is described using the mathematics of metric tensors. The coordinate system we use is called \\"comoving coordinates\\", a type of coordinate system which takes account of time as well as space and the speed of light, and allows us to incorporate the effects of both general and special relativity. =Example: \\"Great Circle\\" metric for Earth's surface= For example, consider the measurement of distance between two places on the surface of the Earth. This is a simple, familiar example of spherical geometry. Because the surface of the Earth is two-dimensional, points on the surface of the Earth can be specified by two coordinates ‚Äì for example, the latitude and longitude. Specification of a metric requires that one first specify the coordinates used. In our simple example of the surface of the Earth, we could choose any kind of coordinate system we wish, for example latitude and longitude, or X-Y-Z Cartesian coordinates. Once we have chosen a specific coordinate system, the numerical values of the coordinates of any two points are uniquely determined, and based upon the properties of the space being discussed, the appropriate metric is mathematically established too. On the curved surface of the Earth, we can see this effect in long-haul airline flights where the distance between two points is measured based upon a great circle, rather than the straight line one might plot on a two-dimensional map of the Earth's surface. In general, such shortest-distance paths are called \\"geodesics\\". In Euclidean geometry, the geodesic is a straight line, while in non-Euclidean geometry such as on the Earth's surface, this is not the case. Indeed, even the shortest-distance great circle path is always longer than the Euclidean straight line path which passes through the interior of the Earth. The difference between the straight line path and the shortest-distance great circle path is due to the curvature of the Earth's surface. While there is always an effect due to this curvature, at short distances the effect is small enough to be unnoticeable. On plane maps, great circles of the Earth are mostly not shown as straight lines. Indeed, there is a seldom-used map projection, namely the gnomonic projection, where all great circles are shown as straight lines, but in this projection, the distance scale varies very much in different areas. There is no map projection in which the distance between any two points on Earth, measured along the great circle geodesics, is directly proportional to their distance on the map; such accuracy is possible only with a globe. =Metric tensors= In differential geometry, the backbone mathematics for general relativity, a metric tensor can be defined which precisely characterizes the space being described by explaining the way distances should be measured in every possible direction. General relativity necessarily invokes a metric in four dimensions (one of time, three of space) because, in general, different reference frames will experience different intervals of time and space depending on the inertial frame. This means that the metric tensor in general relativity relates precisely how two events in spacetime are separated. A metric expansion occurs when the metric tensor changes with time (and, specifically, whenever the spatial part of the metric gets larger as time goes forward). This kind of expansion is different from all kinds of expansions and explosions commonly seen in nature in no small part because times and distances are not the same in all reference frames, but are instead subject to change. A useful visualization is to approach the subject rather than objects in a fixed \\"space\\" moving apart into \\"emptiness\\", as space itself growing between objects without any acceleration of the objects themselves. The space between objects shrinks or grows as the various geodesics converge or diverge. Because this expansion is caused by relative changes in the distance-defining metric, this expansion (and the resultant movement apart of objects) is not restricted by the speed of light upper bound of special relativity. Two reference frames that are globally separated can be moving apart faster than light without violating special relativity, although whenever two reference frames diverge from each other faster than the speed of light, there will be observable effects associated with such situations including the existence of various cosmological horizons. Theory and observations suggest that very early in the history of the universe, there was an inflationary phase where the metric changed very rapidly, and that the remaining time-dependence of this metric is what we observe as the so-called Hubble expansion, the moving apart of all gravitationally unbound objects in the universe. The expanding universe is therefore a fundamental feature of the universe we inhabit ‚Äì a universe fundamentally different from the static universe Albert Einstein first considered when he developed his gravitational theory. =Comoving coordinates= In expanding space, proper distances are dynamical quantities which change with time. An easy way to correct for this is to use comoving coordinates which remove this feature and allow for a characterization of different locations in the universe without having to characterize the physics associated with metric expansion. In comoving coordinates, the distances between all objects are fixed and the instantaneous dynamics of matter and light are determined by the normal physics of gravity and electromagnetic radiation. Any time-evolution however must be accounted for by taking into account the Hubble law expansion in the appropriate equations in addition to any other effects that may be operating (gravity, dark energy, or curvature, for example). Cosmological simulations that run through significant fractions of the universe's history therefore must include such effects in order to make applicable predictions for observational cosmology. Understanding the expansion of the universe =Measurement of expansion and change of rate of expansion= When an object is receding, its light gets stretched (redshifted). When the object is approaching, its light gets compressed (blueshifted). In principle, the expansion of the universe could be measured by taking a standard ruler and measuring the distance between two cosmologically distant points, waiting a certain time, and then measuring the distance again, but in practice, standard rulers are not easy to find on cosmological scales and the timescales over which a measurable expansion would be visible are too great to be observable even by multiple generations of humans. The expansion of space is measured indirectly. The theory of relativity predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the redshift-versus-distance relationship known as Hubble's Law; functional forms for cosmological distance measurements that differ from what would be expected if space were not expanding; and an observable change in the matter and energy density of the universe seen at different lookback times. The first measurement of the expansion of space came with Hubble's realization of the velocity vs. redshift relation. Most recently, by comparing the apparent brightness of distant standard candles to the redshift of their host galaxies, the expansion rate of the universe has been measured to be H0 = . This means that for every million parsecs of distance from the observer, the light received from that distance is cosmologically redshifted by about . On the other hand, by assuming a cosmological model, e.g. Lambda-CDM model, one can infer the Hubble constant from the size of the largest fluctuations seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background. A higher Hubble constant would imply a smaller characteristic size of CMB fluctuations, and vice versa. The Planck collaboration measure the expansion rate this way and determine H0 = . There is a disagreement between the two measurements, the distance ladder being model-independent and the CMB measurement depending on the fitted model, which hints at new physics beyond our standard cosmological models. The Hubble parameter is not thought to be constant through time. There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. It was earlier expected that the Hubble parameter would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the universe. Surprisingly, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be less than zero (actually, consistent with ‚àí1) which implied that today the Hubble parameter is converging to a constant value as time goes on. Some cosmologists have whimsically called the effect associated with the \\"accelerating universe\\" the \\"cosmic jerk\\". The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was given for the discovery of this phenomenon.The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 In October 2018, scientists presented a new third way (two earlier methods, one based on redshifts and another on the cosmic distance ladder, gave results that do not agree), using information from gravitational wave events (especially those involving the merger of neutron stars, like GW170817), of determining the Hubble Constant, essential in establishing the rate of expansion of the universe. =Measuring distances in expanding space= At cosmological scales the present universe is geometrically flat, which is to say that the rules of Euclidean geometry associated with Euclid's fifth postulate hold, though in the past spacetime could have been highly curved. In part to accommodate such different geometries, the expansion of the universe is inherently general relativistic; it cannot be modeled with special relativity alone, though such models exist, they are at fundamental odds with the observed interaction between matter and spacetime seen in our universe. The images to the right show two views of spacetime diagrams that show the large-scale geometry of the universe according to the ŒõCDM cosmological model. Two of the dimensions of space are omitted, leaving one dimension of space (the dimension that grows as the cone gets larger) and one of time (the dimension that proceeds \\"up\\" the cone's surface). The narrow circular end of the diagram corresponds to a cosmological time of 700 million years after the big bang while the wide end is a cosmological time of 18 billion years, where one can see the beginning of the accelerating expansion as a splaying outward of the spacetime, a feature which eventually dominates in this model. The purple grid lines mark off cosmological time at intervals of one billion years from the big bang. The cyan grid lines mark off comoving distance at intervals of one billion light years in the present era (less in the past and more in the future). Note that the circular curling of the surface is an artifact of the embedding with no physical significance and is done purely to make the illustration viewable; space does not actually curl around on itself. (A similar effect can be seen in the tubular shape of the pseudosphere.) The brown line on the diagram is the worldline of the Earth (or, at earlier times, of the matter which condensed to form the Earth). The yellow line is the worldline of the most distant known quasar. The red line is the path of a light beam emitted by the quasar about 13 billion years ago and reaching the Earth in the present day. The orange line shows the present-day distance between the quasar and the Earth, about 28 billion light years, which is, notably, a larger distance than the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light: ct. According to the equivalence principle of general relativity, the rules of special relativity are locally valid in small regions of spacetime that are approximately flat. In particular, light always travels locally at the speed c; in our diagram, this means, according to the convention of constructing spacetime diagrams, that light beams always make an angle of 45¬∞ with the local grid lines. It does not follow, however, that light travels a distance ct in a time t, as the red worldline illustrates. While it always moves locally at c, its time in transit (about 13 billion years) is not related to the distance traveled in any simple way since the universe expands as the light beam traverses space and time. In fact the distance traveled is inherently ambiguous because of the changing scale of the universe. Nevertheless, we can single out two distances which appear to be physically meaningful: the distance between the Earth and the quasar when the light was emitted, and the distance between them in the present era (taking a slice of the cone along the dimension that we've declared to be the spatial dimension). The former distance is about 4 billion light years, much smaller than ct because the universe expanded as the light traveled the distance, the light had to \\"run against the treadmill\\" and therefore went farther than the initial separation between the Earth and the quasar. The latter distance (shown by the orange line) is about 28 billion light years, much larger than ct. If expansion could be instantaneously stopped today, it would take 28 billion years for light to travel between the Earth and the quasar while if the expansion had stopped at the earlier time, it would have taken only 4 billion years. The light took much longer than 4 billion years to reach us though it was emitted from only 4 billion light years away, and, in fact, the light emitted towards the Earth was actually moving away from the Earth when it was first emitted, in the sense that the metric distance to the Earth increased with cosmological time for the first few billion years of its travel time, and also indicating that the expansion of space between the Earth and the quasar at the early time was faster than the speed of light. None of this surprising behavior originates from a special property of metric expansion, but simply from local principles of special relativity integrated over a curved surface. =Topology of expanding space= A graphical representation of the expansion of the universe from the Big Bang to the present day, with the inflationary epoch represented as the dramatic expansion of the metric seen on the left. This visualization can be confusing because it appears as if the universe is expanding into a pre-existing empty space over time. Instead, the expansion created, and continues to create, all of known space and time. Over time, the space that makes up the universe is expanding. The words 'space' and 'universe', sometimes used interchangeably, have distinct meanings in this context. Here 'space' is a mathematical concept that stands for the three-dimensional manifold into which our respective positions are embedded while 'universe' refers to everything that exists including the matter and energy in space, the extra-dimensions that may be wrapped up in various strings, and the time through which various events take place. The expansion of space is in reference to this 3-D manifold only; that is, the description involves no structures such as extra dimensions or an exterior universe. The ultimate topology of space is a posteriori ‚Äì something which in principle must be observed ‚Äì as there are no constraints that can simply be reasoned out (in other words there can not be any a priori constraints) on how the space in which we live is connected or whether it wraps around on itself as a compact space. Though certain cosmological models such as G√∂del's universe even permit bizarre worldlines which intersect with themselves, ultimately the question as to whether we are in something like a \\"Pac-Man universe\\" where if traveling far enough in one direction would allow one to simply end up back in the same place like going all the way around the surface of a balloon (or a planet like the Earth) is an observational question which is constrained as measurable or non-measurable by the universe's global geometry. At present, observations are consistent with the universe being infinite in extent and simply connected, though we are limited in distinguishing between simple and more complicated proposals by cosmological horizons. The universe could be infinite in extent or it could be finite; but the evidence that leads to the inflationary model of the early universe also implies that the \\"total universe\\" is much larger than the observable universe, and so any edges or exotic geometries or topologies would not be directly observable as light has not reached scales on which such aspects of the universe, if they exist, are still allowed. For all intents and purposes, it is safe to assume that the universe is infinite in spatial extent, without edge or strange connectedness. Regardless of the overall shape of the universe, the question of what the universe is expanding into is one which does not require an answer according to the theories which describe the expansion; the way we define space in our universe in no way requires additional exterior space into which it can expand since an expansion of an infinite expanse can happen without changing the infinite extent of the expanse. All that is certain is that the manifold of space in which we live simply has the property that the distances between objects are getting larger as time goes on. This only implies the simple observational consequences associated with the metric expansion explored below. No \\"outside\\" or embedding in hyperspace is required for an expansion to occur. The visualizations often seen of the universe growing as a bubble into nothingness are misleading in that respect. There is no reason to believe there is anything \\"outside\\" of the expanding universe into which the universe expands. Even if the overall spatial extent is infinite and thus the universe cannot get any \\"larger\\", we still say that space is expanding because, locally, the characteristic distance between objects is increasing. As an infinite space grows, it remains infinite. =Density of universe during expansion= Despite being extremely dense when very young and during part of its early expansion - far denser than is usually required to form a black hole - the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This is because commonly-used calculations for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang. =Effects of expansion on small scales= The expansion of space is sometimes described as a force which acts to push objects apart. Though this is an accurate description of the effect of the cosmological constant, it is not an accurate picture of the phenomenon of expansion in general. For much of the universe's history the expansion has been due mainly to inertia. The matter in the very early universe was flying apart for unknown reasons (most likely as a result of cosmic inflation) and has simply continued to do so, though at an ever-decreasing rate due to the attractive effect of gravity. Animation of an expanding raisin bread model. As the bread doubles in width (depth and length), the distances between raisins also double. In addition to slowing the overall expansion, gravity causes local clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. Once objects are formed and bound by gravity, they \\"drop out\\" of the expansion and do not subsequently expand under the influence of the cosmological metric, there being no force compelling them to do so. There is no difference between the inertial expansion of the universe and the inertial separation of nearby objects in a vacuum; the former is simply a large-scale extrapolation of the latter. Once objects are bound by gravity, they no longer recede from each other. Thus, the Andromeda galaxy, which is bound to the Milky Way galaxy, is actually falling towards us and is not expanding away. Within the Local Group, the gravitational interactions have changed the inertial patterns of objects such that there is no cosmological expansion taking place. Once one goes beyond the Local Group, the inertial expansion is measurable, though systematic gravitational effects imply that larger and larger parts of space will eventually fall out of the \\"Hubble Flow\\" and end up as bound, non-expanding objects up to the scales of superclusters of galaxies. We can predict such future events by knowing the precise way the Hubble Flow is changing as well as the masses of the objects to which we are being gravitationally pulled. Currently, the Local Group is being gravitationally pulled towards either the Shapley Supercluster or the \\"Great Attractor\\" with which, if dark energy were not acting, we would eventually merge and no longer see expand away from us after such a time. A consequence of metric expansion being due to inertial motion is that a uniform local \\"explosion\\" of matter into a vacuum can be locally described by the FLRW geometry, the same geometry which describes the expansion of the universe as a whole and was also the basis for the simpler Milne universe which ignores the effects of gravity. In particular, general relativity predicts that light will move at the speed c with respect to the local motion of the exploding matter, a phenomenon analogous to frame dragging. The situation changes somewhat with the introduction of dark energy or a cosmological constant. A cosmological constant due to a vacuum energy density has the effect of adding a repulsive force between objects which is proportional (not inversely proportional) to distance. Unlike inertia it actively \\"pulls\\" on objects which have clumped together under the influence of gravity, and even on individual atoms. However, this does not cause the objects to grow steadily or to disintegrate; unless they are very weakly bound, they will simply settle into an equilibrium state which is slightly (undetectably) larger than it would otherwise have been. As the universe expands and the matter in it thins, the gravitational attraction decreases (since it is proportional to the density), while the cosmological repulsion increases; thus the ultimate fate of the ŒõCDM universe is a near vacuum expanding at an ever-increasing rate under the influence of the cosmological constant. However, the only locally visible effect of the accelerating expansion is the disappearance (by runaway redshift) of distant galaxies; gravitationally bound objects like the Milky Way do not expand and the Andromeda galaxy is moving fast enough towards us that it will still merge with the Milky Way in 3 billion years time, and it is also likely that the merged supergalaxy that forms will eventually fall in and merge with the nearby Virgo Cluster. However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility. =Metric expansion and speed of light= At the end of the early universe's inflationary period, all the matter and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field). While special relativity prohibits objects from moving faster than light with respect to a local reference frame where spacetime can be treated as flat and unchanging, it does not apply to situations where spacetime curvature or evolution in time become important. These situations are described by general relativity, which allows the separation between two distant objects to increase faster than the speed of light, although the definition of \\"distance\\" here is somewhat different from that used in an inertial frame. The definition of distance used here is the summation or integration of local comoving distances, all done at constant local proper time. For example, galaxies that are more than the Hubble radius, approximately 4.5 gigaparsecs or 14.7 billion light-years, away from us have a recession speed that is faster than the speed of light. Visibility of these objects depends on the exact expansion history of the universe. Light that is emitted today from galaxies beyond the cosmological event horizon, about 5 gigaparsecs or 16 billion light-years, will never reach us, although we can still see the light that these galaxies emitted in the past. =Scale factor= At a fundamental level, the expansion of the universe is a property of spatial measurement on the largest measurable scales of our universe. The distances between cosmologically relevant points increases as time passes leading to observable effects outlined below. This feature of the universe can be characterized by a single parameter that is called the scale factor which is a function of time and a single value for all of space at any instant (if the scale factor were a function of space, this would violate the cosmological principle). By convention, the scale factor is set to be unity at the present time and, because the universe is expanding, is smaller in the past and larger in the future. Extrapolating back in time with certain cosmological models will yield a moment when the scale factor was zero; our current understanding of cosmology sets this time at 13.799 ¬± 0.021 billion years ago. If the universe continues to expand forever, the scale factor will approach infinity in the future. In principle, there is no reason that the expansion of the universe must be monotonic and there are models where at some time in the future the scale factor decreases with an attendant contraction of space rather than an expansion. =Other conceptual models of expansion= The expansion of space is often illustrated with conceptual models which show only the size of space at a particular time, leaving the dimension of time implicit. In the \\"ant on a rubber rope model\\" one imagines an ant (idealized as pointlike) crawling at a constant speed on a perfectly elastic rope which is constantly stretching. If we stretch the rope in accordance with the ŒõCDM scale factor and think of the ant's speed as the speed of light, then this analogy is numerically accurate ‚Äì the ant's position over time will match the path of the red line on the embedding diagram above. In the \\"rubber sheet model\\" one replaces the rope with a flat two-dimensional rubber sheet which expands uniformly in all directions. The addition of a second spatial dimension raises the possibility of showing local perturbations of the spatial geometry by local curvature in the sheet. In the \\"balloon model\\" the flat sheet is replaced by a spherical balloon which is inflated from an initial size of zero (representing the big bang). A balloon has positive Gaussian curvature while observations suggest that the real universe is spatially flat, but this inconsistency can be eliminated by making the balloon very large so that it is locally flat to within the limits of observation. This analogy is potentially confusing since it wrongly suggests that the big bang took place at the center of the balloon. In fact points off the surface of the balloon have no meaning, even if they were occupied by the balloon at an earlier time. In the \\"raisin bread model\\" one imagines a loaf of raisin bread expanding in the oven. The loaf (space) expands as a whole, but the raisins (gravitationally bound objects) do not expand; they merely grow farther away from each other. Theoretical basis and first evidence The expansion of the universe proceeds in all directions as determined by the Hubble constant. However, the Hubble constant can change in the past and in the future, dependent on the observed value of density parameters (Œ©). Before the discovery of dark energy, it was believed that the universe was matter- dominated, and so Œ© on this graph corresponds to the ratio of the matter density to the critical density (\\\\Omega_m). =Hubble's law= Technically, the metric expansion of space is a feature of many solutions to the Einstein field equations of general relativity, and distance is measured using the Lorentz interval. This explains observations which indicate that galaxies that are more distant from us are receding faster than galaxies that are closer to us (see Hubble's law). =Cosmological constant and the Friedmann equations= The first general relativistic models predicted that a universe which was dynamical and contained ordinary gravitational matter would contract rather than expand. Einstein's first proposal for a solution to this problem involved adding a cosmological constant into his theories to balance out the contraction, in order to obtain a static universe solution. But in 1922 Alexander Friedmann derived a set of equations known as the Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might expand and presenting the expansion speed in this case.Friedman, A: √úber die Kr√ºmmung des Raumes, Z. Phys. 10 (1922), 377‚Äì386. (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 1991‚Äì2000.) The observations of Edwin Hubble in 1929 suggested that distant galaxies were all apparently moving away from us, so that many scientists came to accept that the universe was expanding. =Hubble's concerns over the rate of expansion= While the metric expansion of space appeared to be implied by Hubble's 1929 observations, Hubble disagreed with the expanding-universe interpretation of the data: Hubble's skepticism about the universe being too small, dense, and young turned out to be based on an observational error. Later investigations appeared to show that Hubble had confused distant H II regions for Cepheid variables and the Cepheid variables themselves had been inappropriately lumped together with low-luminosity RR Lyrae stars causing calibration errors that led to a value of the Hubble Constant of approximately 500 km/s/Mpc instead of the true value of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. The higher value meant that an expanding universe would have an age of 2 billion years (younger than the Age of the Earth) and extrapolating the observed number density of galaxies to a rapidly expanding universe implied a mass density that was too high by a similar factor, enough to force the universe into a peculiar closed geometry which also implied an impending Big Crunch that would occur on a similar time-scale. After fixing these errors in the 1950s, the new lower values for the Hubble Constant accorded with the expectations of an older universe and the density parameter was found to be fairly close to a geometrically flat universe. However, recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies revealed a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant, implying a universe that seems expanding too fast compared to previous measurements. In 2001, Wendy Freedman determined space to expand at 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec - roughly 3.3 million light years - meaning that for every 3.3 million light years further away from the earth you are, the matter where you are, is moving away from earth 72 kilometers a second faster. In the summer of 2016, another measurement reported a value of 73 for the constant, thereby contradicting 2013 measurements from the European Planck mission of slower expansion value of 67. The discrepancy opened new questions concerning the nature of dark energy, or of neutrinos. =Inflation as an explanation for the expansion= Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case, but with the development of models of cosmic inflation, the expansion of the universe became a general feature resulting from vacuum decay. Accordingly, the question \\"why is the universe expanding?\\" is now answered by understanding the details of the inflation decay process which occurred in the first 10‚àí32 seconds of the existence of our universe.Interview with Alan Guth; THE INFLATIONARY UNIVERSE, [11.19.02] by Edge.org. During inflation, the metric changed exponentially, causing any volume of space that was smaller than an atom to grow to around 100 million light years across in a time scale similar to the time when inflation occurred (10‚àí32 seconds). =Measuring distance in a metric space= The diagram depicts the expansion of the universe and the relative observer phenomenon. The blue galaxies have expanded further apart than the white galaxies. When choosing an arbitrary reference point such as the gold galaxy or the red galaxy, the increased distance to other galaxies the further away they are appear the same. This phenomenon of expansion indicates two factors: there is no centralized point in the universe, and that the Milky Way Galaxy is not the center of the universe. The appearance of centrality is due to an observer bias that is equivalent no matter what location an observer sits. In expanding space, distance is a dynamic quantity which changes with time. There are several different ways of defining distance in cosmology, known as distance measures, but a common method used amongst modern astronomers is comoving distance. The metric only defines the distance between nearby (so-called \\"local\\") points. In order to define the distance between arbitrarily distant points, one must specify both the points and a specific curve (known as a \\"spacetime interval\\") connecting them. The distance between the points can then be found by finding the length of this connecting curve through the three dimensions of space. Comoving distance defines this connecting curve to be a curve of constant cosmological time. Operationally, comoving distances cannot be directly measured by a single Earth-bound observer. To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of standard candles, or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the Lambda-CDM model. It is, indeed, by making such observations that it was determined that there is no evidence for any 'slowing down' of the expansion in the current epoch. Observational evidence Theoretical cosmologists developing models of the universe have drawn upon a small number of reasonable assumptions in their work. These workings have led to models in which the metric expansion of space is a likely feature of the universe. Chief among the underlying principles that result in models including metric expansion as a feature are: * the Cosmological Principle which demands that the universe looks the same way in all directions (isotropic) and has roughly the same smooth mixture of material (homogeneous). * the Copernican Principle which demands that no place in the universe is preferred (that is, the universe has no \\"starting point\\"). Scientists have tested carefully whether these assumptions are valid and borne out by observation. Observational cosmologists have discovered evidence ‚Äì very strong in some cases ‚Äì that supports these assumptions, and as a result, metric expansion of space is considered by cosmologists to be an observed feature on the basis that although we cannot see it directly, scientists have tested the properties of the universe and observation provides compelling confirmation. Sources of this confidence and confirmation include: * Hubble demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us, as predicted by a universal expansion.Hubble, Edwin, \\"A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae\\" (1929) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168-173 (Full article, PDF) Using the redshift of their electromagnetic spectra to determine the distance and speed of remote objects in space, he showed that all objects are moving away from us, and that their speed is proportional to their distance, a feature of metric expansion. Further studies have since shown the expansion to be highly isotropic and homogeneous, that is, it does not seem to have a special point as a \\"center\\", but appears universal and independent of any fixed central point. * In studies of large-scale structure of the cosmos taken from redshift surveys a so-called \\"End of Greatness\\" was discovered at the largest scales of the universe. Until these scales were surveyed, the universe appeared \\"lumpy\\" with clumps of galaxy clusters, superclusters and filaments which were anything but isotropic and homogeneous. This lumpiness disappears into a smooth distribution of galaxies at the largest scales. * The isotropic distribution across the sky of distant gamma-ray bursts and supernovae is another confirmation of the Cosmological Principle. * The Copernican Principle was not truly tested on a cosmological scale until measurements of the effects of the cosmic microwave background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems were made. A group of astronomers at the European Southern Observatory noticed, by measuring the temperature of a distant intergalactic cloud in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background, that the radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times.Astronomers reported their measurement in a paper published in the December 2000 issue of Nature titled The microwave background temperature at the redshift of 2.33771 which can be read here . A press release from the European Southern Observatory explains the findings to the public. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is strong and direct observational evidence for metric expansion. Taken together, these phenomena overwhelmingly support models that rely on space expanding through a change in metric. It was not until the discovery in the year 2000 of direct observational evidence for the changing temperature of the cosmic microwave background that more bizarre constructions could be ruled out. Until that time, it was based purely on an assumption that the universe did not behave as one with the Milky Way sitting at the middle of a fixed-metric with a universal explosion of galaxies in all directions (as seen in, for example, an early model proposed by Milne). Yet before this evidence, many rejected the Milne viewpoint based on the mediocrity principle. More direct results of the expansion, such as change of redshift, distance, flux, angular position and the angular size of astronomical objects, have not been detected yet due to smallness of these effects. Change of the redshift or the flux could be observed by Square Kilometre Array or Extremely Large Telescope in the mid-2030s.Direct detection of the cosmic expansion: the redshift drift and the flux drift See alsoComoving and proper distances Notes Printed references Eddington, Arthur.

Then, after having been headquarters of Ras Kassa Haile Darge and Ras Seyoum Mengesha, it was definitely reoccupied by the Italians on 28 February 1936. A rock-hewn church served as the shelter of Ras Kassa. In 1938, there were shops and restaurants in Abiy Addi, a telephone and telegraph office, a health post and a school. There was also an important market. At May Lomin, there were gardens with bananas, coffee and lemons. view on May Lomin With only minimal forces the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) had captured the lightly defended Abiy Addi in 1976 and controlled it for almost a year before being forced out of the town by superior Derg Forces. The Red Terror was particularly brutal in this town, undoubtedly because of the TPLF's support in this area. During a market day in July 1977, the Derg executed 178 people in the town square, claiming that they were thieves. Eyewitnesses report that most of the victims were peasants, many of whom had travelled from the neighboring woreda of Adet to buy salt because of shortages at home. In the following years, Abiy Addi exchanged hands between the TPLF and the Derg was bombed by the Derg thirteen times, 340 houses were burnt or destroyed, and over 400 of the town's inhabitants were killed or wounded. This violence caused many people to leave the area, some for Mekele, and others as far as the liberated territories around Shiraro where even merchants took up farming. On 1 March 1985 Abiy Addi was bombed on a market day. In 1988, the TPLF took definite control of Abiy Addi, and held it to the conclusion of the Ethiopian Civil War.

After Educational shut down its Hollywood studio, Lamont was hired by Columbia Pictures to work with such stars as Charley Chase and The Three Stooges, but his stay was short (\\"I had an intense hatred for [Columbia president] Harry Cohn,\\" said Lamont to authors Ted Okuda and Edward Watz). Lamont then freelanced at various studios (and produced a few features himself) before joining Universal Pictures in 1942. Lamont always had a tremendous rapport with juvenile performers, and Universal entrusted him with a series of musical-comedy vehicles for the studio's teenage singing star Gloria Jean. Lamont emphasized the comic elements of the films, with Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan contributing their talents, and the teen musicals were very popular with wartime audiences. Lamont's experience with limited budgets served him well at Universal, and soon he was promoted to the studio's more important productions. By 1950 he was established as one of Universal's most efficient directors. So it was with surprise and reluctance that Lamont received his new assignment: Abbott and Costello movies. These comedy features were moneymakers for the studio but had no prestige at all, and Lamont bristled at what seemed to be a backward career move. His Universal bosses explained their need for a good comedy director who could do the job indefinitely, and Lamont came to realize that \\"Abbott and Costello were my future.\\" Lamont remained with the team until the studio cut them loose in 1955. Lamont also directed Universal's successful Ma and Pa Kettle comedies; his last film was the final Francis the Talking Mule comedy, Francis in the Haunted House (1956). Death Lamont died of pneumonia in 1993 at age 98.

History It opened in 1941 as part of RAF Fighter Command's 12 Group.Willis S & B R Holliss (1987) Military Airfields in the British Isles 1939-1945 (Omnibus Edition), Woolnough Bookbinding Ltd, Northants, 283 pp, During its life, the base has been known as: * RAF Llanbedr until 1957 * RAE Llanbedr until 1992 * T&EE; Llanbedr (Test & Evaluation Establishment) until 1995. * DTEO Llanbedr (Defence Test & Evaluation Organisation) until 1997 * DERA Llanbedr until 2001, when most of DERA became QinetiQ. The site was (from Spring 1942) an operational base for Towed Target (and in 1943, became the home of the RAF's No. 12 Fighter Gunnery School), and later, Target Drone services to the UK Armed Forces. Target provision services were typically to the Cardigan Bay Ranges (UK Danger Area EGD201, under the control of Aberporth) but Llanbedr targets also worked other UK ranges, including the Royal Artillery range off the Hebrides and occasionally overseas. During the Second World War, RAF Llanbedr was home to thirty-two different RAF Squadrons on rotation who flew a variety of aircraft (Spitfire, Mustang, Typhoon, Anson, Lysander and Martinet). The longest serving Squadron was No. 631 Squadron (RAF) who arrived at Llanbedr in May 1945 from RAF Towyn and stayed until February 1949. The Squadron was re- numbered as No. 20 Squadron RAF. The following units were here at some point: =Post RAF= From 1957, civilianisation of the base services (typically airfield operation) began with Short Brothers holding a series of contracts until 1979, when Airwork Services took over and held them until 1991. In 1991, contracts and scope of work changed again and FR Serco took over its running. Secondarily, it served as a Royal Air Force V bomber dispersal airfield, more recently used for military weapons training. The site closed in October 2004. Navigational and ATC equipment was removed by the military and the site put up for sale. In May 2014 the airport re-opened, catering for the needs of general aviation activities in the area. =Recent events= In recent years, the site has been used for agricultural purposes under the terms of an agreement with the Welsh Government, the current site owners. It was reported in February 2008 that Welsh Ministers had awarded preferred bidder status for a 125-year lease to the operators of Kemble Airport near Cirencester. In May 2008, the Snowdonia Society, the Brecon Beacons Park Society and the Friends of Pembrokeshire National Park formed an alliance against the development of a new civilian airport at the site without a full public debate \\"best achieved by making an application for planning permission\\". This campaign has been opposed by members of the local population who are in favour of the reuse and redevelopment of the site. A paper-based petition in favour of Kemble's plans for the airfield attracted over a thousand signatures, while an e-petition from the Snowdonia Society received 156. In December 2008, the Welsh Government gave the go-head for Kemble to take over the airfield, subject to Kemble obtaining the \\"relevant permissions and consents.\\" In November 2009, the Snowdonia National Park Authority took external legal advice and refused to issue certificates of lawful use to Kemble. In August 2011, a certificate was granted to Llanbedr Airfield Estates for use of the airport to test and develop unmanned aerial vehicles. In August 2012, permission was granted to turn the airfield into a yard for the dismantling of airliners. In January 2013 the Welsh Government included the site in the Snowdonia Enterprise Zone. In June 2014 Fly Llanbedr Limited were awarded their licence to run a flight training and air experience operation from Llanbedr Airfield. In July 2014 it was named as one of 8 possible locations for the UK spaceport the British government is looking to establish by 2018. The shortlist was reduced to 6 airports in March 2015, with Llanbedr still a candidate. In June 2015 one of the hangars at Llanbedr Airfield was used for the Red Bull Air Race Barnstorming stunt, where Red Bull Air Race pilots Paul Bonhomme and Steve Jones flew two modified Xtreme Air Sbach XA41's in formation through the hangar itself. In September 2015 the London Gliding Club based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire held an expedition to the airfield in order to take advantage of the unique soaring opportunities that the Site has to offer, which are often not accessible to soaring gliders originating from inland. In three weeks the club achieved 254 movements, with 436 flying hours recorded. In September 2016 the London Gliding Club based in Dunstable, Bedfordshire held another expedition to the airfield. In three weeks the club achieved 262 movements, with 455 flying hours recorded. In October 2018 FlySnowdonia started operating as a flying school from the airfield operating two Robin DR400 aircraft. The airfield is also open to visiting pilots wanting to land but prior permission is required and more information can be found on the FlySnowdonia website.

Korem is located in the endoreic basin of the Afar Triangle. The streams near Korem do not reach the ocean. Hashenge Lake is located six kilometers to the north of Korem. The town of Korem is surrounded by Ofla woreda.  History  = 20th century = The telegraph line the Italians constructed between 1902 and 1904 from Asmara south to Addis Ababa passed through the town, and had an office in Korem. Near the town on 9 October 1909, Abraha Araya, governor of Enderta, made a surprise attack at dawn on Dejazmach Abate Bwalu, the new governor of Tigray. Abreha had declared that he would not submit to the Dejazmach.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 10 January 2008) During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Italians are said to have attacked Ethiopian soldiers near the town with shells releasing mustard gas, with instances of Italians using chemical weapons use at Korem recorded for March 16-18, and April 4-7, 1936. More certain are the reports that three planes of Ethiopian Red Cross, sitting on the airstrip at Korem, were destroyed b18y Italian fighters. In 1937, during the Italian occupation, the Arbegnoch sacked Korem, which was being held by the Italians.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), p. 184 Minister of War Ras Abebe Aregai, made Korem his headquarters during the 1943 Woyane rebellion in Tigray. The main road northwards was finally cleared on 6 October. Korem was the location of one of the early refugee camps of the 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia, housing 35,500 children in April 1983. On 21 April, the TPLF raided the town, seizing humanitarian supplies and taking seven relief workers hostage, who included two British citizens from the Save the Children Fund. The hostages were released unharmed seven weeks later near the Sudan border, but Save the Children suspended operations in Korem until September of that year. From July 1983 up to March 1984 the monthly death toll in the Korem camp stayed under 100; then it shot up until October 1984, when the daily death toll topped 100 a day. What food aid there was in Korem in October 1984 was from the European Commission. Along with the camp at Atsbi, conditions in Korem were shown on BBC television on 23 and 24 October. UN Secretary-General P√©rez de Cu√©llar and his wife visited the relief center in the following month. Although international assistance greatly improved conditions in the camp, they remained grim for the inmates, who were treated as prisoners. In January 1986, an estimated 12,000 of the camp population had fled into the surrounding hills for fear of being registered for involuntary resettlement. EPRDF forces captured Maychew and Korem 8 September 1989, afterwards continuing their advance south along the main highway.  Demographics  Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 16,856, of whom 7,532 are men and 9,324 women. 92.12% of the population said they were Orthodox Christians, and 7.65% were Muslim.Census 2007 Tables: Tigray Region , Tables 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4.

It is narrow and rectangular, bordered on the east by Dr Ivan Ribar street and the neighborhood of Blokovi, and on the west by the mostly uninhabited field of Jasenovo. On the south it borders the embankment on the Sava river.  History  As one of the last neighborhoods built in Novi Beograd before the collapse of the Serbian economy in the early 1990s, it initially was known only by its name. Later block numbers were assigned to it (as for most of Novi Beograd) so that the southern part of the neighborhood is now Block 71 and the northern part is Block 72, so far the two highest numbers of all the blocks. On 25 June 2014, the municipal assembly of New Belgrade voted to establish the new local community, Dr Ivan Ribar.

It was created by Capcom in cooperation with Visual Science Laboratory, and distributed by Digital Amuse. Biohazard 4D-Executer was directed by Koichi Ohata, and written by Daisuke Okamoto, who was supervised by the game series developers. A limited release, the 20-minute film has been an attraction in Japanese theme parks since November 2000, and can be seen in movie theaters and smaller booths. The story centers on the mission of a military squad sent to the zombie-infested Raccoon City to locate the whereabouts of Dr. Cameron, a female scientist conducting research on a new type of virus. Plot The film is set in the Midwestern American Raccoon City, whose citizens have been transformed into zombies after becoming infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. A military squad ‚Äì consisting of leader Claus (Masaki Aizawa) and his men Roger (Hiroto Torihata), Ed (Hideto Ebihara), Robert (Tadasuke Omizu) and Norman (Yoshiyuki Kaneko) ‚Äì is sent into the city by the company. Members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service, a group specialized in containing biohazard outbreaks caused by Umbrella, their objective is to rescue Dr. Cameron (Yurika Hino), a female scientist researching a new virus. The squad tracks a signal from her ID card, and is drawn to a warehouse, where Robert is killed during a surprise attack from an unidentified monster. The team blows the creature to pieces, but is unaware of its ability to transfer its mind to other life forms. The squad leaves to chase Dr. Cameron's now-moving signal to a manhole, and the monster follows them in the body of a crow. Norman and Roger accompany Claus into the sewers, while Ed stands guard on the street. Underground, the team finds Dr. Cameron's equipment, and is attacked by a dog. After shooting the dog, they see the doctor's ID card attached to it. Roger, who is a higher-up within Umbrella, reveals to the others that the true purpose of their mission was not to rescue Dr. Cameron, but to collect her research data regarding a new virus capable of regenerating genes. She was infected with her creation, and mutated into the monster that the squad had fought at the warehouse. While Claus, Norman and Roger return to the surface, Ed is killed by the crow, and transforms into a creature similar to the one in the warehouse. This new monster kills Norman, but Claus and Roger barely escape in a humvee, using a machine gun attached to the vehicle to destroy it. As the two men drive out of the city, Claus asks about the virus. Roger explains how it fuses with genes, enabling Dr. Cameron to regenerate her body in other life forms, and thus making her nearly immortal. Roger then impales Claus with tentacles, pinning him to the seat. At this point, Roger is revealed to have two faces, the second one being Dr. Cameron's. The researcher explains that she was watching them in the body of the dog while they were in the warehouse, and that she realized that Umbrella was pursuing her research data. Dr. Cameron tells Claus that he and his team turned out to be perfect guinea pigs for the virus she had created, and that she will continue her experiments, trying to return herself to a human form. Using tentacles, she rips Claus' face apart. Production and release The concept for Biohazard 4D-Executer was originally conceived by anime director Yasuhiro Imagawa, who proposed his idea of the film to Capcom, the game company responsible for the Resident Evil series. The project was announced to the public in late October 1999, under the tentative title Biohazard 4D-Horror. In the early stages of development, Imagawa was responsible for the planning and the screenplay, and he collaborated on the film with director of photography Shinji Higuchi. The final script was written by Daisuke Okamoto, under the supervision of Capcom's screenwriting subsidiary Flagship. Former Capcom Production Studio 2 game designer and producer Keiji Inafune and Flagship co-founder Noboru Sugimura served as executive supervisors. Inafune referred to the story as a \\"gaiden\\" ‚Äì or side-story ‚Äì for fans of the Resident Evil series. The film marked director Koichi Ohata's first experience with computer-generated imagery (CGI), after his previous work on original video animations such as MD Geist, Cybernetics Guardian and Genocyber. The CGI rendering was handled by the company Visual Science Laboratory, with the creature designs provided by 3D artist Gouta Nanami. Due to the strong graphic violence depicted, shorter versions of the 20-minute film were created, from which certain scenes were cut. Biohazard 4D-Executer is presented in 5.1 surround sound, and features music composed and orchestrated by Yoshihiro Ike. The film was produced with a budget of 150 million yen (approx. US$1.4 million in October 1999), and saw a first screening at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival on October 27, 2000. A widespread release in Japanese theme park theaters followed in November 2000. The film is shown in movie theaters for a large audience, and in single booths for a small number of viewers. For a more immersive presentation of the attraction, distributor Digital Amuse designed special cylindrical seats named \\"gimmick chairs\\", which can shake viewers and blow air on their necks.

Ahead of the 2007 elections, Macri and L√≥pez Murphy have been in discussions with Jorge Sobisch, governor of Neuqu√©n Province and likely presidential candidate in 2007, to create a nationwide centre-right political force. L√≥pez Murphy has fallen out with Sobisch. Macri withdrew his support to Sobisch after the scandal of the death of the teacher Fuentealba during a demonstration in Neuquen. On 2 April 2008, Commitment to Change replaced its name to Republican Proposal.Cambio de Nombre (in Spanish) A year later, Recreate for Growth was absorbed by Republican Proposal.

It is the site of an important fortress with beginnings dating to the Christian period. During the 19th-century (Turkiyya) the town expanded much beyond the fortress to become one of the places with something like urban institutions in Northern Sudan, although it is now largely depopulated. The town of Al-Khandaq, which was once a thriving river port, was the residence of wealthy merchants who built two- storey houses of mud brick, with many rooms, as well as one-storey dwellings. These have been deserted since the early 1970s, when the trade declined. There are two mosques currently in use: al-Hassanab and al-Khatibiya. Public buildings include the police station (established in 1902), the rest house (established in 1905) and vestiges from the indigo industry. The fort, known as ‚ÄúQaila Qaila‚Äù which means the Red Fort, dominates the town, with its south- west tower visible from both north and south, while its western wall overlooks the area with the remains of the south-western and interval towers. The fort is in desperate need of support, especially the towers. Al-Khandaq is situated about 423 km north of Khartoum on the left bank of the Nile. The town and its environs, Wad Nimeiri, Magasir Island, Kabtod and Hannek-Koya, include houses, palaces, qubbas, cemeteries and khawas of Islamic date. Al-Khandag was a primary port on the river between the 17th and 20th centuries connecting western Sudan with the river. It was described by the early travellers as one of the best-built towns in Nubia and was the residence of several rich merchants who resided in unique two-storey mud brick houses. The village was constructed on top of a medieval Christian fortress, but rapidly expanded beyond it. The site began to decline during the 1940s as the port faced increasing competition from the railway and road traffic as goods carriers. https://books.google.se/books?id=C9J7DwAAQBAJ&lpg;=PA448&ots;=X55WJMR4So&dq;=khandaq%20sudan&hl;=sv&pg;=PA448#v=onepage&q;=khandaq%20sudan&f;=false Edited by Mohamed Kamal M.Salih (Sweden) Category:Populated places in Sudan ","title":"El Khandaq"},{"id":"5985416","text":"Satellite photo of the Sahara. The Great Green Wall or Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel () is Africa's flagship initiative to combat the increasing desertification. Led by the African Union, the initiative aims to transform the lives of millions of people by creating a mosaic of green and productive landscapes across North Africa. From the initial idea of a line of trees from east to west bordering the Saharan Desert, the vision of a Great Green Wall has evolved into that of a mosaic of interventions addressing the challenges facing the people in the Sahel and the Sahara.[1] As a programming tool for rural development, the overall goal of this partnership is to strengthen regional resilience and natural systems with sound ecosystem management, protection of rural heritage, and improved living conditions. The project is a response to the combined effect of natural resources degradation and drought in rural areas.[2] It is a partnership that supports communities working towards sustainable management and use of forests, rangelands and other natural resources. It seeks to help communities mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as improve food security.[3] The population of the Sahel is expected to double by 2039, adding urgency to the project. History In 1950s the British explorer Richard St. Barbe Baker made an expedition in the Sahara. During St. Barbe's expedition he proposed a \\"Green front\\" to act as a tree buffer to contain the expanding desert. The idea re- emerged in 2002, at the special summit in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. It was approved by the Conference of Leaders and Heads of States members of the Community of Sahel-Saharan States during their seventh ordinary session held in Ouagadougou in the capital of Burkina Faso on 1‚Äì2 June 2005. The African Union endorsed it in 2007 as the ‚ÄòGreat Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative‚Äô (GGWSSI). Lessons learnt from the Algerian Green Dam and the Green Wall of China led to an integrated multi-sectoral approach. Originally a tree planting initiative, the project evolved into a development programming tool. In 2007, CHSG directed the project to tackle the social, economic and environmental impacts of land degradation and desertification. The countries Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Chad thereafter created the Panafrican Agency of the Great Green Wall (PAGGW). A harmonised regional strategy was adopted in September 2012 by the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN). According to AMCEN, the Great Green Wall is a flagship program that will contribute to the goal of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, or RIO+20, of \\"a land degradation neutral world\\". In 2014, the European Union and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in collaboration with African and other regional partners, launched the Action Against Desertification program to build on the GGWSSI. Nigeria created an interim agency to support GGW development. Drylands Monitoring Week (2015) assessed the state of dryland measurement and initiated collaboration toward large- scale, comprehensive monitoring. Planning (including choices of vegetation and work with local populations) and plantings/land restoration followed (including in Ethiopia, Senegal, Nigeria and Sudan). By 2016, about 15 per cent of the targeted acreage had been planted. In 2016, 21 countries had projects related to the GGW, including farmer-supported natural regeneration. Bare land restoration has been successfully demonstrated in Burkina Faso, although security is an issue in the face of terrorist activity. Partners The Initiative brings together more than 20 countries, including Algeria, Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, The Gambia and Tunisia. Regional and international partners include: * African Forest Forum (AFF) * African Union Commission (AUC) * Association for the promotion of education and training abroad (APEFE) * Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) * Community of Sahel- Saharan States (CEN-SAD) * Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) * European Union (EU) * Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) * Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (GM-UNCCD) * Intergovernmental Authority on Development in Eastern Africa (IGAD) * MDG Center for West and Central Africa (MDG-WCA) * Pan African Farmers Organization (PAFO) * Panafrican Agency of the Great Green Wall (PAGGW) * Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) * Sahara and Sahel Observatory (OSS) * Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD-Secretariat) * United Nations Development Programme‚ÄìDrylands, Development Center (UNDP-DDC) * United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) * United Nations Environment Programme‚ÄìWorld Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC) * Walloon Region of Belgium, Wallonie-Bruxelles International * World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) * World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) * The World Bank Major principles The project encompasses the Saharan strip, north and south borders, including Saharan oases and enclaves, such as Cape Verde. The GGWSSI intends to strengthen existing mechanisms (such as Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program, Environmental Program (CAADP) of NEPAD, regional, sub-regional, and national action programmes to combat desertification) to improve their efficiency through synergy and coordination activities. The Regional Harmonised Strategy emphasizes partnerships between stakeholders, integration into existing programmes, sharing of lessons learnt (especially through South-South cooperation and technology transfer), local participation and ownership of actions and developing more integrated and global planning. The $8-billion project intends to restore 100 million hectares (250 million acres; 1 million km¬≤) of degraded land by 2030, which would create 350,000 rural jobs and absorb 250 million tonnes (250 million long tons; 280 million short tons) of from the atmosphere. Implementation The eco-friendly search engine Ecosia has since 2014 started to partner up with the local population in Burkina Faso. In 2017 it has spread its campaign to Ethiopia and the following year to Senegal as well. According to Ecosia, it has planted over 16,940,947 trees and were restored in Burkina Faso; in Senegal it planted over 1,424,748 and restored and planted over 3,963,273 trees and restored in Ethiopia as of 2 July 2020. Though no other source for this can be found. In September 2017, the BBC reported that progress was best in Senegal. As of March 2019, 15 per cent of the wall is complete with significant gains made in Nigeria, Senegal and Ethiopia. In Senegal, over 11 million trees had been planted. Nigeria has restored 4.9 million ha (12 million acres; 49,000 km¬≤) of degraded land and Ethiopia has reclaimed 15 million ha (37 million acres; 150,000 km¬≤). In September 2020 it was reported that the Great Green Wall had only covered 4% of the planned area, with only 4m hectares planted. Ethiopia has had the most success with 5.5bn seedlings planted, but Chad has only planted 1.1m. Doubt was raised over the survival rate of the 12m trees planted in Senegal.

Due to different transliterations from the Arabic, the name components are also spelled in various combinations Dem, Dehm, Deym, Dam, Daym or Daim, and Zubair, Zubayr, Zoubair, Zoubeir, Zoubayr, Zobeir, Ziber, Zebehr, or Zubier, respectively. The historical remains of the slave camp have been designated a potential UNESCO World Heritage Centre site. In the collective memory of South Sudanese people, the very name Deim Zubeir rings as a synonym for millennia of slavery, at least since Pharaonic times.

History  = Domination by Dar Fur Sultanate (18th to mid-19th century) = 1818 map of \\"Abyssinia & Nubia\\", speaking of \\"independent negroes\\"Zande with shields & harp, 1879Little is known about historical developments at the location before the second half of the 19th century. Even its original name is not clear: according to the pioneering scholar of Sudan history Richard Leslie Hill, it was called ‚ÄúBayyu‚Äù, which is the same name as reportedly remembered by Zubeir Rahma. In slight contrast, Gerasimos Makri writes that the old name was \\"BƒÅya\\" and Douglas H. Johnson mentions it as \\"Gbaya\\". Edward Thomas elaborates that \\"Gbaya\\" is another name for \\"Kresh\\", which is in turn the \\"name for several groups with origin stories in Western Bahr al-Ghazal and present-day CAR.\\" Zande throwing knives, 1879 Portrait of a Zande warrior, 1879 Historiography has established though, that at least since the 18th century people in the Western part of the Bahr El Ghazal river system area were constantly on the move because of external pressures. Social groups were rather small and shifted frequently to avoid attacks from powerful neighbours who already possessed European weapons and forcefully expanded the trans-Saharan and Nilotic trading networks into the hinterlands for the exploitation of copper, ivory, ostrich feathers and slaves. From the northern side, this pressure increased since the early 17th century with the rise of the Dar Fur Sultanate, as it established a patron- client relationship over the lowlands which became known as Dar Fertit. While \\"Dar\\" means \\"home of\\", \\"Fertit\\" does not describe any ethnic group, but was at the time a pejorative \\"catch-all word for non-Fur, non-Arab, non-Dinka and non-Luo groups of Western Bahr El Ghazal\\". Darfur historian Rex Sean O'Fahey describes the dynamic frontiers as follows: > \\"it was not so much a place but rather a state of mind. As the slave raiders > moved southwards, so Dar Fartit moved south.\\" From the south-western side, meanwhile, the people in Dar Fertit came under pressure from systematic raidings by Zande chieftains and kings. = Turkiya (1821-1884/5) = Illustration of slave raiding in Sudan from a missionary bookAl-Zubeir Rahma Mansur The Sudanese historian Ahmed Sikainga describes the impact, which the Egyptian-Ottoman conquest of the Funj Kingdom in 1821 had on the lands of Dar Fertit, as follows: > \\"It represented the first large-scale efforts to draw the Nilotic regions > into the expanding capitalist economy. Following the opening of the White > Nile waters for navigation in the early 1840s, bands of European, Levantine, > and northern Sudanese traders began to rush to the South. Eager to > appropriate the resources of these virgin lands, these traders dominated the > region by combining military power, political alliances, slave > incorporation, and the judicious organization known as the zariba system. An > Arabic word meaning 'thorned enclosure', the zariba in the Sudanese context > referred to the small fortified settlements that were erstablished by the > traders.\\" A female slave from Bahr El Ghazal photographed in 1882 in Khartoum The Northern Sudanese merchant Al-Zubeir Rahma Mansur first came to Bahr El Ghazal in 1856 with a cousin on a mission for the major trader Ali Amuriyy, since the Egyptian government had been monopolising trade in Northern Sudan, which encouraged commercial expansion beyond the state control into the South. Zachary Berman argues that Zubeir was an imperialist \\"buccaneer\\" following the market as an archetypical agent, \\"however unconsciously, of broader global market forces expressing themselves in Bahr al-Ghazal\\", namely Great Britain and France through Egypt. At first he went for ivory, ostrich feathers and gum arabic, which were greatly demanded luxury goods in Europe. However, like other merchants, he found that profits were not sufficient for the required capital of his own company and hence ventured into slave trading. In 1865, Zubeir‚Äôs army of slaves killed a local king called Adoo Shukoo and took control of his small territory, transforming the merchant into a monarch. Johnson stresses the strategic importance of the location ‚Äúwhere the north- south caravan route from Dar Fartit to Zandeland joined the east-west route to the Nile via Wau, Meshra el-Rek, Rumbek, and Shambe‚Äù. Lawrence Mire also argues that this critical location allowed him to have wider influence than other traders. While slave-raiding had been practised by Southern warlords before, the trade was taken under Zubeir to unprecedented large-scale levels. According to another pioneer of Sudan academia, Richard Gray, \\"by 1867 it was reliably estimated that 1800 slaves a year were being despatched northwards by Zubair\\". It is widely assumed that in what is now South Sudan altogether as many as 400,000 people were enslaved in just fourteen years. Many thousands are assumed to have been killed as they resisted. Deim Zubeir became, \\"as it were, the metropolis and the clearing house of the slave industry in that part of the world.\\" Zubeir himself later claimed in a number of interviews that the establishment of his rule was a civilising mission in the name of Islam and that locals flocked to him for life service because of the stable conditions he provided in contrast to their previous poverty and insecurity. He also argued that European colonialism in the name of abolitionism was just another form of slavery.Georg SchweinfurthBazinger slave soldiers In 1871, at the height of his power, when Zubeir controlled much of the Bahr el Ghazal region as well as what are today parts of Chad and the CAR, he was visited at Deim Zubeir by the pioneering botanist and ethnologist Georg Schweinfurth, who was the first European to see the place. A blog series by the Smithsonian Libraries summarises the impressions of the Baltic German scholar and abolitionist, who went on to become a leading proponent for colonial ambitions of the German Empire, as follows: > ‚ÄúHe found it to be a small town of many thousands of people, including > Zubayr‚Äôs army, government officials, and traders and their armies, all with > their wives, concubines, children, personal slaves and their families, plus > a group of religious authorities (ulema). To survive, this parasitic > community raided surrounding villages, stealing cattle and food crops and > taking slaves not only for service in the zariba but also to work the > traders‚Äô own farms back in northern Sudan and, of course, to sell to foreign > markets. Schweinfurth reported seeing four classes of slaves, all subjected > to 'unbelievable degradation and cruelty': adult men, who served as > soldiers; boys ages seven to ten, who carried their guns and ammunition; > women, 'passed like dollars from hand to hand' as wives, concubines, and > household servants; and both men and women to do field work and care for > animals. He also reported that Zubayr‚Äôs court was 'little less than > princely.' ‚Äù thumbleft Illustration of Gessi's troops attacking Deim Suleiman Romolo GessiIn 1873, the Ottoman rulers of Sudan acknowledged Zubeir‚Äôs power and granted him the title of governor over Bahr El Ghazal. One year later, he conquered the Darfur sultanate with his army of bazinger slave soldiers. As Zachary Berman concludes, Deim Zubeir was \\"simultaneously imperial and imperialized, an empire unto himself as well as part of overlapping overarching powers.\\" At this point, the Khedive ruler in Cairo moved against Zubeir's ambitions and had him detained indefinitely from 1876 on. Instead, Zubeir's son Suleiman took over and renamed Deim Zubeir into Deim Suleiman (also transliterated into various spellings like Dem Soliman, Daym Sulayman etc.). Suleiman took advantage of the discontent that had grown amongst Northern Sudanese traders because of high taxes and the anti-slavery efforts imposed by the government in Khartoum and started a rebellion in 1877.Illustration of Suleiman's executionRichard BuchtaSuleiman's revolt was, however, short-lived. In 1878 and 1879 his forces were defeated by an Egyptian army under the Italian Romolo Gessi. The support of local Southern allies and their proxy forces led by the Zande king Tombura and Golo chief Kayongo played a key role in the war. Suleiman surrendered, but was executed regardless. Gessi moved into his former residence and set up headquarters there. One of his first steps was to disarm many of his own troops, who - by his own account - \\"were no less brutal and savage than Suleiman‚Äôs troops.‚Äù Wilhelm Junker In November 1879, the Austrian photographer, writer and scientist Richard Buchta visited Gessi, who retained the name Deim Suleiman. In a letter to Schweinfurth he wrote that Gessi, with the support of local Southern fighters whom he had armed as proxies, \\"did not just chase away the slave-traders, but actually annihilated them. Without any mercy, hundreds of Jellaba were chased into the bushes like wild beasts and butchered to death.\\"alt= The Russian- German explorer Wilhelm Junker, who visited Deim Suleiman shortly after Buchta, noted that: > \\"Soliman Bey Ziber had undoubtedly greatly strengthened the place, > especially in recent times. Around the whole zeriba runs a double and treble > palisade, 26 feet high; within this enclosure the several courts are > separated by matting almost hard as boards, and behind them are grouped the > high and spacious dwellings sur-mounted by conic roofs. Soliman's residence, > now occupied by Gessi, was built in the style of a two-storeyed house in > Khartum; there were also several other strong brick structures, besides > magazines well suited for their purpose.\\" left With regard to demographics, Junker observed: \\"so great a mixture of tribes has resulted from the Arab rule, that it is no longer possible to lay down accurate frontiers between the several populations.\\" Salim Charles Wilson in 1901 The most prominent slave, who was freed during Gessi's war against Suleiman, became Hatashil Masha Kathish. While this is how he himself wrote his birth-name, other sources spell it as Hatashil Macar Aciethiec or Atobhil Macar Kathiec. He was born around 1859 as the son of a Gok Dinka chief in today's Cuiebet and captured in 1876 by slavers, who renamed him \\"Salim\\". In 1880, he met the Church Missionary Society missionaries Charles T. Wilson and Robert Felkin in Deim Suleiman, became the servant of Wilson and joined him on his way back to England. There he was baptised in 1882 under the name Salim Charles Wilson and later started doing missionary work in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, becoming known as \\"The Black Evangelist of the North\\". Deim Suleiman remained the official capital of Bahr El Ghazal and housed many shops with its craftsmen being famous for their skills, though Wau became the greater commercial centre. According to Father Stefano Santandrea of the Verona Fathers, the first buildings of burnt-bricks in the province were erected under the rule of Gessi as well as the first school, \\"to which 17 chiefs were already sending their children. They were receiving instruction (in Arabic) together with over 100 children of the local troops\\". Gessi declared his expectation to draw government clerks from the indigenous graduates after a few years. Santandrea also reports that \\"a splendid new mosque was being built, and Gessi won many hearts by this act\\". It was the first mosque ever in all of Bahr El Ghazal. Gessi's successor as Ottoman governor (Bey), the Englishman Frank Miller Lupton, revived the official name Deim Zubeir instead of Deim Suleiman after his arrival there in December 1881. However, according to a British ornithologist, locals called the town \\"Juku\\".alt= = Mahdiya (1884/5-1898) = leftIn early 1884, a joint campaign by Mahdist rebels led by Emir Karam Allah Kurkusawi, a former merchant, and local Southern forces defeated the Turkish-Egyptian rule in Bahr El Ghazal, almost one year before the fall of Khartoum. According to the Austrian Rudolf Carl von Slatin Pasha, one of Kurkusawi's brothers had served as a commander under Lupton Bey and therefore managed to convince most of the Ottoman officers and troops to defect. In April 1884, having fought for eighteen months against the Islamist insurgents, Lupton was compelled to surrender to Kurkusawi in Deim Zubeir. After this victory Kurkusawi soon engaged in fighting against local Southern groups. However, he was recalled, following the death of the Mahdist leader Muhammad Ahmad in June 1885, and Bahr El Ghazal got abandoned by Ahmad's successors. Thus, the settlement was largely left to itself for almost one decade and \\"reduced to an ill-presided collection of tumbledown buildings of raw bricks\\", but was then all the more re-elevated to the global stage of imperialist competition around the \\"Scramble for Africa\\":  Belgian Colonial Expeditions (1892-1894)  Leopold II The grave of Felix Foulon at the cemetery of Saint-Gilles, leftAccording to Belgian records, it was a request in 1892 from Faki Ahmed, the Sultan of Wadai, for assistance against the Mahdist forces, which provided the occasion for the colonial strategists in Brussels to intervene for their \\"intention\\" to expand the Congo Free State up to Deim Zubeir, with the support of proxy troops from their Zande allies, who had started pushing into Western Bahr El Ghazal already two years earlier. In 1892, an expedition under Felix Foulon marched towards Deim Zubeir and signed treaties with a number of local chiefs. According to some sources, he did reach Deim Zubeir, but other accounts claim that he did not. A second mission under Xavier-Ernest Donckier de Donceel marched towards Deim Zubeir in April 1894, but retreated from there under pressure from Mahdist forces. A few months later, in August 1894, Belgium's King Leopold II ceded all territorial claims over Bahr El Ghazal to France. During the withdrawal, the Belgian officer Florent Colmant \\"wanted to satisfy a long-cherished wish of seeing with his own eyes Deim Zubeir\\", reached the place with some 80 troops on 24 December and left the next day: > \\"he only saw half-ruined houses of sunbaked bricks.\\"  French Colonial Expeditions (1897-1900)  alt=leftTwo years later, French military missions of Senegalese troops under Victor Liotard penetrated into Bahr-al-Ghazal from what is now the CAR, and took possession of Deim Zubeir in April 1897. Santandrea noted with reference to the account of one member of the French mission that they found \\"an abandoned place, where one does not even see ruins, except traces of a trench (ditch) about 100 metres by side\\". The colonial officer Adolphe Louis Cureau founded a new post and renamed Deim Zubeir into Fort Dupleix. His successor Liotard had a new fortified building erected. This was done with regard to the strategic importance of the location as a potential key hub for the expeditionary force of General Jean-Baptiste Marchand in its quest to expand France's control of territory up to the Nile. Following the Fashoda incident and the Franco- Egyptian treaty of 1899 which ceded Bahr El Ghazal to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the French forces left the post in 1900. = Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (1899-1955) = Zubeir Rahma in 1896 during his Cairo exile View of Deim Zubeir, 1902 (Slatin collection, Sudan Archive Durham SAD.A32/78) In 1900, an Anglo-Egyptian \\"reoccupation\\" force of Egyptian and Sudanese soldiers entered Bahr El Ghazal. Most of them had reportedly been recruited from the defeated Mahdist army and \\"were chiefly ex-slave natives of the Province\\", which caused some unease amongst the population. Postcard from circa 1906, caption: 'Birri Pool, Near Dem-Zubeir\\" The first British officer to conduct a patrol to Deim Zubeir was Major William Boulnois in early 1901. His mission found that > \\"the shrunken remnant of the population, constantly raided not only by the > Azande but by other groups, had in despair given up all attempt either to > keep livestock or to cultivate. Forced down to the level of primitive > 'hunters and collectors', they now existed 'chiefly on the natural resources > of the forest - roots, seeds, wild honey, fruit and wild beasts'.\\" David Comyn One year later, Captain Arthur Murray Pirie officially \\"occupied\\" the place for the annexation of Bahr El Ghazal, but was soon recalled for a punitive expedition. The first inspector to head the post was an Egyptian officer, who was soon succeeded by the Scottish Lieutenant David Comyn. According to Santandrea, Comyn \\"found only one building worth mentioning, namely the newly erected fort of the French\\". However, Comyn writes in his memoirs that he also saw \\"the charred remains of the stockade\\" of Sulaiman's fortifications. Even a decade later, one of Comyn's successors wrote that \\"the burnt stumps of his stockade, and the mud walls of his houses\\" were still visible. 1917 map of Deim Zubeir area Soon after his arrival Comyn ordered the construction of a new fort \\"to take the place of the one of green brick built by the French\\", since the competition with the Congo Free State for control of Southern Sudan was not over yet. From 1902 on, negotiations were conducted between London and Brussels, accompanied \\"by provocative incidents\\": 1909 map of the Lado Enclave In this context, Belgium's King Leopold II ordered a \\"scientific\\" mission to Bahr El Ghazal under Charles Lemaire and Louis Royaux in 1902. Its vanguard led by Captain Andr√© Landeghem reached Deim Zubeir in February 1903, but the Condominium government of Sudan prevented the expedition from moving on to the copper-rich area of Hofrat en Nahas and Landeghem aborted the mission. Leopold gave up his claims to the Southern Sudan only in 1906, in return for keeping a part of it as the Lado Enclave for the duration of his reign. Zubeir Rahma on his deathbed in 1913 in his native Northern Sudanese village of Geili, almost half a century after he set up his slaving regime in Bahr El Ghazal and named its capital after himself In 1903, Deim Zubeir became the capital of the Western District of Bahr al-Ghazal. In 1905, Comyn was assisted by a Syrian medical doctor, an Egyptian police officer and a scribe. The number of ‚Äúirregular troops\\" at the time was around 120, recruited mainly from the local population. Comyn himself claimed that under his command Deim Zubeir became a \\"pioneer of red-brick buildings in Southern Sudan\\". According to South Sudan historians M.W. Daly and √òystein H. Rolandsen, \\"immediate profits were realized from confiscation and sale of the zaribas' stored ivory.\\" Franz Xaver Geyer A doctoral thesis by a South Sudanese historian found that the introduction of tax collecting under Comyn in 1904 was particularly unpopular, since harsher conditions were applied than in neighbouring districts. Locals who could not pay taxes were forced to do road construction work instead. Daly concludes that \\"the most noticeable effect of 'administration' of this type was the recalcitrance of those administered.\\" In his memoirs, Comyn defended himself against his contemporary critics as follows: \\"The hardship and discontent which arose was, I am sure, due to the fact that, in the neighbouring district of Wau, everything that was refused at Dem Zubier ‚Äî i.e. rifles, ammunition, spirits, money, &c.; ‚Äî was freely scattered.\\" Daniele Comboni According to some sources, the administrative headquarters of the Western District of Bahr al-Ghazal were moved from Deim Zubeir to Raja in 1906, according to others in 1907 or early 1908, against the opposition of local leaders in Raja. Deim Zubeir residents at the time included a substantial number of ex-soldiers and former slaves, who had lost their ethnic ties and converted to Islam with Arabic as lingua franca. Refugees from French Equatorial Africa (FEA) settled in Deim Zubeir during this time as well, but were displaced by the British-led colonial administration back to FEA in 1912. Living conditions at the time were particularly hard, since the area of Deim Zubeir was heavily infested with tsetse flies, which transmits the sleeping sickness. At the same time, slave trade did continue in Bahr El Ghazal, since it was - according to British records - \\"the only trade which has any money in it in these parts, except perhaps ivory\\" and for some years no anti-slavery posts were set up because of \\"financial reasons.\\" However, it is not definitely clear whether Deim Zubeir and surrounding areas were still part of it. In any case, there was some presence of Greek merchants in Deim Zubeir, as trade was dominated by the Greeks in Sudan.The emblem of the Comboniansleft In 1923, the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus - also known as the Verona Fathers - moved to realise \\"a long-dreamed plan of expansion in the west\\" by preparing the grounds for the founding of a mission station in Deim Zubeir. Already in 1905, their German Bishop Franz Xaver Geyer had visited the town on his tour to make an assessment of missionary potentials. 18 years later, Provincial Superior Father Angelo Arpe sent a Southern Sudanese catechist, Baptist Mufighi, to Deim Zubeir: > \\"This was a major step for the Verona Fathers. In early times, the mission > had been very hesitant about doing evangelistic work among Muslims. Mufighi > began a school in Deim Zubeir but faced much opposition from the strong > Muslim community there. When Baptist gathered children for his school, > Tabaan, the man in charge of the Muslim school, ordered Baptist's school to > be closed, and all the children sent home. Mufighi refused. He declared that > he must be arrested first, and so presented himself to Major [Mervyn] > Wheatley, the District Commissioner. Wheatley ruled that the new school > should be allowed.\\" The government approval to found a missionary station on the Southern fringe of the widely islamised North-Western Bahr El Ghazal has been considered by Lilian Passmore Sanderson as reflecting \\"the hardening of official policy against Islam in the South.\\" And she stresses that > \\"Ten years earlier, permission would almost certainly have been refused on > the ground that Deim Zubeir was too sensitive an area for a mission > station.\\" For the first years, Mufighi was visited several times a year by Arpe and Father Giuseppe Pagliani at the nascent station. The mission was then officially founded in March 1926 by the fathers Luigi Bernhardt and Giacomo Gubert, who settled in a government compound. In December of that year they were joined by Pagliani, who stayed for altogether more than a decade and \\"- according to many - left a piece of his heart there.\\" The post was dedicated to \\"Our Lady of Mercy\\", the sanctuary of Savona. In this context, Bernhardt noted that - unlike in other missions - there was a great influx of women. Hence, the station was extended by a mission of the Comboni Sisters in 1936. One of the sisters recalled it as \\"a beautiful mission, in lovely scenery, nature seems to make everything flourish: we had good, abundant harvests, plants fruits, flowers, colours etc.\\" In 1953, there were four Comboni sisters from Italy in Deim Zubeir. The preeminent scholar of anthropology and linguistics in the area became Comboni Father Stefano Santandrea, who served in the Deim Zubeir mission from 1948 to 1955 after twenty years in Wau. While travelling outside the station by bicycle, especially to tend to people with lepers, he researched and published numerous articles in academic journals as well as a multitude of monographic books, most prominently his attempt of \\"A Tribal History of the Western Bahr El Ghazal\\". In the early 1950s, Santandrea counted a population of some 500 in the settlement and its neighbourhood with a variety of ethnic affiliations that merged through common inter-marriage. As Sikainga puts it: \\"In this frontier zone, ethnic label fluctuated in response to changing social and political circumstances.\\" Likewise, O'Fahey stresses with special regard to the Dar Fertit area that \\"the simplistic perception of the Sudan as a static mosaic of tribes each immutably living within its own little world is a travesty of the dynamic reality.\\" The British governor of Bahr El Ghazal, Thomas Richard Hornby Owen, observed during a visit to Deim Zubeir in the early 1950s \\"increased drunkenness, particularly among government officials and employees\\". One of the pioneers of modern civilian politics in Southern Sudan, Faustino Roro, was born in Deim Zubeir in 1923. During the early 1940s he co-founded the Southern Sudan Social and Political Association, based in Juba. During his studies of political science in the early 1950s at the American University in Cairo he wrote a number of articles on Southern Sudan for the Egyptian Gazette and is therefore also regarded as a pioneer of South(ern) Sudanese journalism. According to South Sudanese historian Kuyok Abol Kuyok, he played a decisive role as a member of Buth Diu's Liberal Party in drafting principles for demanding Federalism, which has been a key issue ever since. In contrast, also one of the modern pioneers of non-civilian politics in South(ern) Sudan originated from Deim Zubeir: Camillo Kamin Sharf al-Din, a 23-year-old soldier from Deim Zubeir who was one of the mutineers in the Eastern Equatorian town of Torit in August 1955. After the bloody revolt, he fled to Kenya and then Uganda. = Sudan Independence (1956-2011) = Ibrahim Abboud When Sudan gained its independence on 1 January 1956 from the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, the ruling Northern parties in Khartoum harboured deep suspicions against the Christian missionaries in Southern Sudan as foreign agents. Such nationalist and legalistic arguments - rather than religious ones - were used by the government of Abdallah Khalil for its 1957 decision to nationalise all missionary schools, including the Comboni school in Deim Zubeir. Father Santandrea later denied accusations of having excluded Muslim pupils from its elementary school. One of the regular attendees, he emphasized, was a grandson of Dar al-Kuti's Sultan Muhammad al- Sanusi of Ndele, \\"the last of the great slave merchants in Central Africa.\\" Those policies became much more repressive during the military regime of General Ibrahim Abboud, which came to power in late 1958 and pursued a strategy of Arabisation and Islamisation in the South. The army rulers expelled most missionaries in 1962 and 1963 from the Southern Sudanese region and so the Comboni mission in Deim Zubeir was hit as well: apparently only one priest and one sister remained there, Father Angelo Matordes, the superior of the mission, as well as Sister Prassede Zamperini.  Anyanya-Insurrection (1963-1972)  At the same time - in 1963 - the Anyanya rebel movement was founded, though consisting for its first years of rather loosely connected groups. Camillo Kamin Sharf al-Din - the veteran of the 1955 Torit mutiny, who hailed from Deim Zubeir - joined the unsurgents right at the beginning. Other individuals from Fertit communities in the greater Deim Zubeir area joined as well and engaged in attacking army convoys. Also, a leading member in exile of Father Saturnino Lohure's secessionist Sudan African Closed District National Union (SACDNU) - Alexis Mbale - originated from a village close to Deim Zubeir and had been educated at the Comboni mission school there. These affiliations may have been amongst the reasons why government forces in Deim Zubeir suspected collaboration between residents and the insurgents: In 1964, the New York Times reported that the government in Khartoum had received an ‚Äúofficial report‚Äù about a Deim Zubeir resident who had been arrested and executed without trial or investigation over allegations of giving food to rebels. The Scottish journalist Cecil Eprile wrote in a book that the dead body of Albino Bambala, a schoolteacher in Deim Zubeir, showed marks of brutal torture, according to relatives who buried him in February 1964. Bambala‚Äôs name is included in the online project ‚ÄúSouth Sudan: Remembering the Ones We Lost‚Äù. Army patrol in Southern Sudan In a similar incident, church circles reported that at the same time the catechist Baptist Mufighi, who had laid the foundations for the establishment of the Comboni mission, was tortured and killed by \\"Security\\" Police for suspected support of the Anyanya rebels. According to these reports, public commemorations were banned and his family prevented from burying the body. The mission was closed a few days later in the wake of the general expulsions of the last missionaries. In October 1964, the president of the Sudan African National Union, Joseph Oduhu, reported that the Catholic church in Deim Zubeir had been looted by soldiers of the Sudanese Armed Forces. He also accused an Army Captain of raping a schoolmistress. Another Catholic clergyman, Father Barnaba Deng, who had served in Deim Zubeir during the early 1960s and was supportive of the rebellion, got killed in August 1965. The Sudanese Ministry of the Interior later published a \\"Blue Book\\" on the expulsion of the missionaries, which contained correspondence of the Belanda guerilla leader Alfons Dinia with the mission in Deim Zubeir. Dinia operated some 50 miles south-east of the town and was allegedly visited by a member of the station. Sanderson concedes that the letters appear authentic, but she concludes: > \\"The documents do not of course afford any evidence whatever for assistance > to the guerillas by the VFM as an organisation. Indeed, all the evidence > suggests that the Mission was very anxious to avoid comprising itself in > this way, and that it was Mission policy 'to decline every request coming > from doubtful sources'. But it would not be easy, either practically, > humanly or even theologically, for missionaries and priests abrupty to break > off all relations with members of their flock who koined the resistance. And > if a missionary received a plea for help from a parishioner-turned-guerilla > (as many undoubtedly did), was he morally bound to do his strict legal duty > by reporting the circumstances to the nearest police post?\\" According to the Catholic Diocese of Wau, most residents of Deim Zubeir fled in 1965 year to Tambura, near the border with the CAR, and the mission was abandoned. While there were also reports that Anyanya insurgents committed atrocities against recalcitrant civilians as well, it is not known whether such indiscriminate action took place in the Deim Zubeir area, too. The South Sudanese historian Scopas Poggo found through interviews with former Anyanya officers that unity among the rebel forces in Bahr al-Ghazal was only achieved in June 1967 under the command of Philip Nanga Mariik.  Addis Ababa Agreement (1972-1983)  After the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement between the regime of Jafaar Nimeri in Khartoum and the Anyanya rebels, refugees in the neighbouring CAR and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) soon moved back. However, new tensions also soon arose, since Fertit leaders argued that Dinka elites received disproportionate numbers of government jobs.Flag of the Bahr El Ghazal regionThe Comboni missionaries returned to Deim Zubeir as well, though it is unclear when exactly. In 1978, Father Peter Nenebubu was a Parish Priest for Deim Zubeir. At the same time, demands grew louder to rename the town. Most prominently, in 1979 the pioneering Southern Sudanese journalist Atem Yaak protested in an article: > ‚Äúthe real problem with the map [...] is why certain names should continue to > appear in modern maps of the Sudan. I am referring in particular to Deim > Zubair and Said Bundas. The names which make the paper, on which they are > written stink, should be erased from the map of the Sudan.‚Äù  SPLA-Insurrection (1983-2005)  Soon after the 1983 mutiny of Bor, the area of Deim Zubeir was once again affected by war. According to tribal leaders, civilians in Deim Zubeir and surrounding villages suffered from attacks by the insurgent Sudan People‚Äô Liberation Army (SPLA) in 1985 and 1986. Johnson reasons that those raids ‚Äúon Fertit areas were part of a strategy in the mid-1980s to attack civilian populations seen as hostile, which was partially due to the inability of the guerrillas to hold territory‚Äù. Moreover, SPLA assaults on the neighbouring town of Raja around Christmas-time in 1987 and on settlements along the road between Wau and Deim Zubeir caused mass displacement of civilians. SPLA fighters In reaction, this led to the formation of counterinsurgent tribal militias in Deim Zubeir. The Dutch scholar Daniel Blocq, who was a UN military observer in Wau after 2005, argues \\"that the emergence of the Fertit militia was principally a grassroots phenomenon stemming from local tensions and conflicts\\", before such groups were co-opted and armed by the military intelligence of successive regimes in Khartoum for counterinsurgency. According to Samson Wassara, a leading South Sudanese scholar of political science, it was a militia with the euphemistic name National Peace Forces that operated in the area throughout the war. Like the SPLA, this group - also known as Salam Forces or Jaesh As-Salam - was accused by human rights activists like Amnesty International of killing hundreds of civilians. Despite the war and the large distance, Comboni Father Salvatore Pacifico as the Parish Priest of Raga still used to come to Deim Zubeir in the mid-1980s, according to Father Lwanga Cornelio, who was born and raised there. \\"New Sudan\\" In November 1990, the BBC reported that Fertit militia forces defected from the government to the SPLA and \\"overran\\" Deim Zubeir town. Blocq stresses that the tribal and sub-tribal lines were blurred and Fertit combatants could be found on both sides. In June 2001 the SPLA overwhelmed Deim Zubeir, which as a garrison town was a considerable loss for the government in Khartoum. The rebels claimed to have killed 400 government soldiers. The BBC Monitoring Service at the time noted reports that the SPLA also ‚Äúbombed a military camp for the displaced in Deim Zubeir‚Äù. The offensive prompted a mass exodus of the civilian population, including families of soldiers, from Deim Zubeir and surrounding areas heading north and north-west into government-controlled areas. About 30,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) fled towards Timsahah and about 8,000 towards Ed Daein. After their military victory, the rebels also announced that they had renamed the town into ‚ÄúDeim New Sudan‚Äù after the vision of SPLA leader John Garang for a Sudan of unity in diversity. When the Khartoum government prepared for a counter- offensive to recapture Deim Zubeir, ‚Äúthe SPLA allegedly warned a security official with UN Operation Lifeline Sudan that the SPLA had used antipersonnel mines in October 2001 to defend the airstrip at Deim Zubeir‚Äù. In November 2001 the government army took over Deim Zubeir again, with support from one of its Southern proxy militia, the South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF). Subsequently, those pro-Khartoum forces engaged in a military campaign to expel the SPLA from the wider area, which resulted once more in mass displacement of civilians not only to northern Bahr el Ghazal, but also to Western Equatoria.  Comprehensive Peace Agreement (2005-2011)  In the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between Khartoum and the SPLA, Deim Zubeir was designated as one of the five assembly places of the Sudanese Armed Forces in Bahr El Ghazal. According to the Catholic \\"Voice of Hope\\" radio station in Wau, the Salam Forces military of Major-General Eltom Elnur Daldoum, who has a Misseriya background and operated in the Deim Zubeir area, joined the Sudan Armed Forces and became part of the Joint Integrated Units in Wau during the interim period. The number of his fighters was estimated at 400. Displaced people very soon started to return to Deim Zubeir as to the whole region, especially since the road to Wau was de-mined. In August 2005, a group of some 5,000 IDPs arrived after a 350-km journey from Western Equatoria at an interim camp in Bile, near Deim Zubeir. Their return was assisted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with support from the World Food Programme, OCHA, UNICEF, World Vision, MSF Spain - and the Comboni missionaries. Land allocation for the returnees did, however, not take place in the following years. Flag of Western Bahr el Ghazal state In 2008, the 5th Sudan Population and Housing Census counted a total population of 8,474 in the Uyujuku Payam, which comprised the administrative Boma sub-units of Yabulu, Kuru, Sopoi and Uyujuku with Deim Zubeir town. The figures revealed a remarkable gender gap: 4,765 (56.23%) were male, whereas only 3,709 (43.73%) were female. 67.1% of the male and 71.7% of the female residents were under 30 years old. In Uyujuku Boma itself, 3,025 residents were counted. A 2009 field-study by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that some Deim Zubeir residents > ‚Äúwere mostly concerned with wanting the town‚Äôs original tribal name ‚ÄòUyuku‚Äô > back. At the same time, some residents wanted to join Aroyo County near > Aweil in Northern Bahr el-Ghazal while others wanted to stay with Western > Bahr el Gezal because they speak a similar language (Luer).‚Äù A 2003 field-study of linguistics found that the Northern Lwoo language Thuri \\"is spoken by some 6000 individuals in small pockets in western Bahr el- Ghazal, around the towns of Deim Zubeir and Bora.\\" On 31 January 2010, Bishop Rudolf Deng of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wau reopened Deim Zubeir parish. In the January 2011 referendum on the secession of Southern Sudan from Sudan, 1,100 voters in Deim Zubeir cast their ballot. 1,084 (98.91%) voted in favour of separation and 12 (1.09%) for unity with Northern Sudan with 4 invalid votes, according to official results. According to the figures of the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC), 1,113 persons had been registered as voters beforehand, which means that the voter turnout was officially around 97.35%. In March 2011, shortly before the independence of South Sudan it was announced that the Western Bahr el Ghazal State Government had launched a Television station in ‚ÄúUyujuku (Dem - Zubeir)‚Äù. Uyujuku is the Kresh name for the town of Deim Zubeir. The Comboni missionaries use the wording ‚ÄúUyu-Juku (formerly called Deim Zubeir)‚Äù. The SSRC spelled the name \\"Ujuku\\", while the LSE-paper spells it \\"Uyuku\\". According to a British paper from 1884, locals then used to call it \\"Juku\\". As there have been persistent calls by South Sudanese intellectuals to rename Deim Zubeir, it remains unclear whether the name has been officially changed at all. = South Sudan Independence (since 2011) = In August 2011, just weeks after South Sudan became an independent state, it was reported that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) had abducted a school teacher in Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku. In mid-2012, a team of ten missionaries from a Texas-based evangelical organisation visited Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku and recorded 2,700 \\"Indicated Decisions For Christ\\", mainly from \\"animists\\" and Muslims. In September 2012, the Catholic \\"Voice of Hope\\" radio station in Wau reported that General Daldoum's Salam Forces militia, which had been formed in the 1980s and formally joined the Khartoum government's Sudan Armed Forces in the Joint Integrated Units after the 2005 CPA (see 1.5.3 and 1.5.4 ), joined the SPLA Division Five in Wau. A 2013 IOM survey found that Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku was covered by mobile phone networks. Major livelihoods were fishing as well as farming of Sorghum, Sesame, Groundnuts, and Cassava. However, on average there was only about one teacher per 60 students. In October of the same year, the Catholic Radio Network reported that in Deim Zubeir Payam children in \\"almost every household\\" were affected by epilepsy. In addition, 120 cases of Malaria were registered from July to September, \\"leaving many children dead\\".  Violent SPLA-power struggle (since 2013)  Soon after armed conflict between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and militias of his political opponents broke out in South Sudan at the end of 2013, Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku and the neighbouring areas were once more affected by war. In 2014, groups from Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku quickly joined opposition cells in Bahr El Ghazal \\"under the auspices of the Fertit Lions\\". In early 2015, it was reported that youth rioters broke into World Food Programme (WFP) stores in the town and stole bags of food after protests against the rations they were receiving. A 2016 UNDP survey also mentions armed conflicts between agriculturalists and nomadic pastoralists in Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku. In April 2016, President Kiir issued an order that divided Raga county, which Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku had been a part of, into three counties. Uyujuku has since become the administrative headquarter of Kuru county. Two months later, Lol State governor Rizik Hassan Zacharia appointed Lt. Col. Arkangelo Vestus Nimour as county commissioner. At the same time, Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku apparently once again also became a strategic hub for Sudanese militias, namely the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) from Darfur. In May 2016, Sudan Tribune reported that JEM units backed by troops from the government in Juba had clashed with opposition forces and captured their military base. The specialised news website also quoted a military intelligence officer in Wau as accusing \\"local people in the area of collaborating with armed groups by not giving them any information about their hideouts.\\" In June 2016, the Sudanese government claimed that 11 detainees had managed to escape from a JEM camp in Deim Zubeir area, after it had been destroyed by South Sudanese rebels. Both the South Sudanese government and JEM have repeatedly denied such claims, but the final report of the Panel of Experts on the Sudan from December 2016 stated to the United Nations Security Council that ‚Äúsome sources informed the Panel of the existence of JEM bases in the Raja area and in Deim Zubeir.‚Äù Many more IDPs arrived in Deim Zubeir / Uyujuku from Raja after clashes in June 2016 and April 2017. In August 2017, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that the population of Deim Zubeir was 54,000 people and included 18,000 displaced who had fled not only from Raja, but also from Korogana and Sopo. In April 2018, more clashes took place \\"around\\" Deim Zubeir between government troops based in the town and rebel forces of former Vice- President Riek Machar. Both sides traded blame for the fighting and reported conflicting numbers of casualties. According to a report by the UN Security Council, the government forces were supported by JEM fighters and the clashes resulted in further civilian displacement.  Potential UNESCO World Heritage site  alt= On 3 October 2017, the government of South Sudan submitted the name of the historical site of the slave camp to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre to be included on its first ever Tentative List of potential World Heritage sites. The UNESCO report detailed the following: > \\"Zubeir Rahma constructed a trench and a fortification where slaves were > kept awaiting to be transported to various destinations along the Nile > northwards. The trench was built underground almost four meters deep and > three kilometres long; wood and mud were used in the construction. The > trench contains rooms used as prisons to confine the slaves, and on its edge > is a tree renowned as a hanging place for slaves who attempted to escape > from their captors. [..] Today, the Deim Zubeir slave trench is located by > the present day main road from Wau to Raja in Wau County. It is not well > maintained and needs urgent safeguarding to preserve its importance as a > cultural heritage site. The tree that was notorious as the site of slave > hangings remains next to the trench.\\" left In its statement on authenticity and integrity, UNESCO added: > \\"The chiefs of the community in the Payam are also involved in collecting > information and data about the site, including how it was affiliated with > the former inhabitants‚Äô lifestyles and cultures. However, additional support > is needed from historians and anthropologists to look into the shape and > content of the trench, which is currently underground and unexcavated.\\" Historical items from Deim Zubeir are scattered across European museums. Artefacts taken as a trophy by Romolo Gessi were sold by his widow to the Museum of Ethnography and Prehistory in Rome. Parts of the collection were later transferred to other museums in Italy. In June 2019, UNESCO supported a field-mission to Deim Zubeir of South Sudanese expert Elfatih Atem, who is also director of a national non-governmental organisation, the Likikiri Collective, which has specialised in conducting oral history research. Atem worked > \\"to collect material evidence, photos of the landscape and narratives of > slave trade and legacy of slavery at the site as part of South Sudan‚Äôs > efforts to justify its potential criteria for World Heritage listing. During > his consultations, he raised awareness of the World Heritage Convention as > well as the responsibilities and opportunities linked with World Heritage > status.

The company had multi-locational manufacturing facilities, and a broad product portfolio under an umbrella brand ‚Äì Nirma. Nirma successfully countered competition from HUL and carved a niche for itself in the lower-end of the detergents and toilet soap market. However, Nirma realised that it would have to launch products for the upper end of the market to retain its middle class consumers who would graduate to the upper end. The company launched toilet soaps for the premium segment. However, analysts felt that Nirma would not be able to repeat its success story in the premium segment. In 2000, Nirma had a 15% share in the toilet soap segment and more than 30% share in the detergent market. Aided by growth in volumes and commissioning of backward integration projects, Nirma's turnover for the year ended March 2000 increased by 17% over the previous fiscal, to ‚Çπ1,217 crores.

The new yellow powder was priced at ‚Çπ3.50 per kg, at a time when HUL's Surf was priced at ‚Çπ13. Soon, there was a huge demand for Nirma in Ruppur (Gujarat), Patel's hometown. He started packing the formulation in a 10x10ft room in his house. Patel named the powder as Nirma, after his daughter Nirupama. Patel was able to sell about 15-20 packets a day on his way to the office on bicycle, some 15 km away. By 1985, Nirma washing powder had become one of the most popular, household detergents in many parts of the country. By 1999, Nirma was a major consumer brand, offering a range of detergents, soaps and personal care products. Nirma's success in the highly competitive soap and detergent market was attributed to its brand promotion efforts, which was complemented by its distribution reach and market penetration. Nirma's network consisted of about 400 distributors and over 20 lakh retail outlets across the country. This huge network enabled Nirma to make its products available to the smallest village. In November, 2007, Nirma purchased American raw materials company Searles Valley Minerals Inc., making it among the top seven soda ash manufacturers in the world.

New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2014. 136. Along with manigramam and ainurruvar (the Ayyavole Five Hundred), the anjuvannam merchant guild played a major role in the commercial activities of the region. Unlike manigiramam, which was also operating in Indian hinterland, the presence of anjuvannam is found only in coastal towns. The guild of anjuvannam was organised by West Asian traders that included Jewish, Syrian Christian, Muslim and Zoroastrian Parsi merchants operating in south India (mostly Indian Ocean trade). Historian Y. Subbarayalu had defined the anjuvannam guild as a \\"body of West Asian traders\\". The merchants generally operated in the trading ports of Konkan, Malabar Coast and Coromandel Coast of south India (and even in South East Asia including Java). In some ports this guild obtained royal charters, which permitted the special immunities and privileges within those cities. Anjuvannam finds mention in number of south Indian inscriptions, most notably in Quilon Syrian copper plates (c. 849 CE) and in Jewish copper plates of Cochin (c. 1000 CE).Narayanan, M. G. S. PerumƒÅ·∏∑s of Kerala. Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 278, 437 and 451. The increased association of the guild with the Jewish traders of Malabar Coast is visible in the latter inscription. The earliest concrete epigraphical evidence of anjuvannam is the Quilon Syrian copper plates (c. 849 CE). The guild was active on the Kerala coast in the 9th century CE. From the early 10th century, ainurruvar (the Ayyavole Five Hundred) guild spread throughout south India bringing under its umbrella most of the pre-existing guilds. Both anjuvannam and manigiramam were incorporated into the Five Hundred. In and after 12th century, the Five Hundred acted as an umbrella organisation to cover all the other smaller merchant guilds. During the 11th - 13th centuries anjuvannam was mostly composed of Muslim traders on both the west and east coasts of India. A person in the Anjuvannam community is known as an \\"anjuvannan\\". Etymology An explanation traces the origin of the name anjuvannam to the Avestic word hanjumana and Persian word anjuman/an«∞oman that refers to an organisation or association of people. *The term hanjama or hanjamana is found Telugu and Kannada records. \\"Hanjamana\\" is the title used in inscription from the Konkan coast. *According to an earlier explanation, the title Anjuvannam derives from the Hindu varna system as any person not belonging to one of the four varnas was referred to as an anjuvannan.

Their first EP Loudhailer Songs and d√©but album I am John's Pancreas brought them to the attention of BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, for whom they recorded four sessions. Their career was brought to a halt with the death of guitarist Rick Aitken in 1989. Founder member and songwriter Vince Hunt revived the band with a new line-up for a series of UK-wide dates in 2014 marking the 25th anniversary of Aitken's death, and the band continues to play live. Career A Witness were formed in 1982 in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England, by Rick Aitken (guitar), Vince Hunt (bass) and a drum machine, in 1986 replaced by Alan Brown (of Big Flame fame). Keith Curtis (vocals) and Noel Kilbride (guitar) joined the group in 1983. Initially signing to the Ron Johnson label, debut EP Loudhailer Songs put them at the forefront of a wave of Beefheart-influenced bands that emerged in the mid-1980s, and won praise from the NME. A review of the EP in Sounds described it as \\"pop music perfectly perverted\\".Mr. Spencer (1985) \\"Singles\\", Sounds, 14 December 1985, p. 22 They gained further attention due to the inclusion of the track \\"Sharpened Sticks\\" on the NME's C86 cassette in the following year. Debut album I Am John's Pancreas followed in October 1986, entering the NME charts and reaching a position of number 18. After a tour of Germany and Holland with Ron Johnson labelmates Big Flame, A Witness recruited multi-instrumentalist Alan Brown on drums to replace the drum machine. He also contributed arrangement and songwriting ideas, including co-writing final single '(I Love You) Mr Disposable Razors'. With Brown on drums A Witness released a further two 12\\" singles on Ron Johnson (one each in 1987 and 1988) before its collapse. Communion issued the US-only Sacred Cow Heart compilation in 1988. When Brown moved on to launch his solo project The Great Leap Forward, he was replaced on the drum stool by Triss King, a gifted drummer who had worked with quirky Hebden Bridge-based outfit Bogshed. King recorded the studio versions of the band's final single '(I Love You) Mr Disposable Razors' and played on the final A Witness gigs when the band were rehearsing mostly in Liverpool, where he lived. However the group was shattered by the death of guitarist Rick Aitken aged 33 in a climbing accident in Scotland in October 1989, just before a UK tour supporting The Wedding Present that would have re- established their profile. Stunned by Aitken's death, the band retired rather than continue. The third and fourth A Witness BBC radio sessions for John Peel were collected on an album (The Peel Sessions), and a single \\"I Love You Mr. Disposable Razors\\" which had been due for release at the time of Aitken's death was delayed so it could be dedicated to him. The single was issued in November 1989 on the Vinyl Drip label. The Imaginary compilation series Through the Looking Glass 1966 included their cover version of The Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and Through The Looking Glass 1967 compilation (1990) included their cover of The Doors' track \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\". Post break-up Keith Curtis went on to play guitar for John Robb's Membranes and bass in Goldblade. Vince Hunt recorded three critically acclaimed soundscape albums as Pure Sound; Pure Sound (Yukon (2006), Submarine (2007), and Acts of New Noise (2008), then converted the band into a live unit featuring Harry Stafford (keyboards, Inca Babies), Rob Haynes (drums, Goldblade) and Boz Hayward (guitar, HoundGod). The band released a fourth album in June 2010 called 'Life Under Glass'. Hunt was also a founder member of Marshall Smith in 1997, with Alan Brown from Big Flame and former Pram drummer Daren Garratt, recording a debut album 'Colours'. Hunt joined the Inca Babies in 2009 replacing the late Bill Marten and played on the albums 'Death Message Blues' (2010), 'Deep Dark Blue' (2012) and 'The Stereo Plan' (2014). In 2016 he joined Martin Bramah's Blue Orchids performing live and making his recording debut on two songs on the B-side of the 'Skull Jam' 10\\" single released in 2017. Interest in A Witness has never waned, and a retrospective, Threaphurst Lane, was issued on Overground Records in 2002, while 2006 saw the reissue of I Am John's Pancreas for the first time on CD on Hunt's own Euphonium label, home to his various musical interests. Paris concert footage In September 2011, footage of A Witness in concert in Paris recorded twenty five years earlier was uploaded to YouTube. The concert ‚Äì from December 1986 ‚Äì featured five tracks, two from the album I Am John's Pancreas. \\"Sharpened Sticks\\" was included on the NME's collection C-86 and \\"The Loudhailer Song\\" was part of a collection of tracks from the period included in a compilation Death To Trad Rock, accompanying John Robb's 2010 book. The three other tracks ‚Äì \\"Nodding Dog Moustache\\", \\"Faglane Morris Wind\\" and \\"Raw Patch\\" ‚Äì formed the bulk of the following A Witness 12\\" single One Foot in the Groove, their 1988 final release with Ron Johnson.  The Oberhausen tapes  A chance meeting between German A Witness fan Wolfgang Kunst and bassist Vince Hunt at an Inca Babies gig at the 12-Bar venue in London in 2011 led to previously unknown footage of A Witness emerging. Kunst had been in the audience for a concert featuring A Witness and Big Flame at the Oberhausen Old Daddy venue on 9 September 1986 and later ordered from the local record shop a VHS copy of a video featuring four new UK bands: A Witness, Big Flame, Age of Chance and The Wedding Present. In a subsequent conversation in 2012, he offered to send the VHS to Hunt, who had it digitised and uploaded to YouTube in January 2013. The footage features six songs from the album I Am John's Pancreas which was released on Ron Johnson Records just weeks after the show. The songs are \\"Smelt Like a Pedestrian\\", \\"O'Grady's Dream\\", \\"The Loudhailer Song\\", \\"Sharpened Sticks\\", \\"Red Snake\\" and \\"Hard Day's Love\\". There are also performances of \\"Camera\\" and \\"Lucky in London\\" (from the November 1984 EP Loudhailer Songs, their first release for the Ron Johnson label). This was the first live footage to emerge of \\"Lucky in London\\", \\"O'Grady's Dream\\", \\"Red Snake\\" and \\"Hard Day's Love\\", some of the group's best-known songs. The line- up of the band for this show is Rick Aitken (guitar), Vince Hunt (bass) and Keith Curtis (vocals) with a Drumatix 606 drum machine. Hunt later sold the Drumatix 606 to John Robb, who owned it as of December 2012.  Reformation with new line-up  To mark the 25th anniversary of the death of guitarist Rick Aitken, founder member Vince Hunt assembled a new line-up of the band to perform some live dates. One-time drummer Alan Brown replaced Aitken and singer Simon 'Crayola' Williams (of the group Sarandon) took over vocal duties from Keith Curtis. Goldblade and Inca Babies drummer Rob Haynes joined the line-up with Vince Hunt remaining on bass. The band's first live show was in London in April 2014 with art punk veterans The Cravats.

In a tribute following his death in 2016, President Michael D. Higgins said Justice Hardiman \\"was one of the great legal minds of his generation\\", who was \\"always committed to the ideals of public service\\". He was described as a \\"colossus of the legal world\\" by Chief Justice Susan Denham. One commentator wrote that \\"Hardiman‚Äôs greatest contribution ...was the steadfast defence of civil liberties and individual rights\\" and that \\"He was a champion of defendants' rights and a bulwark against any attempt by An Garda S√≠och√°na to abuse its powers\\". Hardiman received the rare honour of being appointed directly from the Bar to the Ireland's highest court. Prior to his elevation to the Supreme Court in 2000, he had a successful practice as a barrister, focusing on criminal law and defamation, after being called to the Irish bar in 1974. Birth and education Adrian Hardiman was born on 21 May 1951, in Coolock, Dublin. His father was a teacher and President of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI). He was educated at Belvedere College, Dublin, and University College Dublin, where he studied history, and the King's Inns. He was president of the Student Representative Council at UCD and Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society (UCD) and won The Irish Times National Debating Championship in 1973. Family Hardiman was married to Judge Yvonne Murphy, from County Donegal, a judge of the Circuit Court between 1998 and 2012, who conducted important inquiries relating to sex abuse including the Murphy Report and the Cloyne Report. She has been chair of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby homes. Justice Hardiman and Judge Murphy had three sons, one of whom, Eoin, is a barrister and has been a member of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee; Hugh, who was a personal assistant to Michael McDowell, when McDowell was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Daniel, a Doctor.https://www.independent.ie/irish- news/news/prodigious-talent-recalled-as-judge-hardiman-is-laid-to- rest-34530813.html Political career He joined Fianna F√°il while a student in University College Dublin,(article copy is held at IrishSalem.com) and stood (unsuccessfully) for the party in the local elections in D√∫n Laoghaire in 1985. In 1985, he became a founder member of the Progressive Democrats, but left the party when he was appointed to the Supreme Court. He remained very friendly with the former party leader and ex-T√°naiste, Michael McDowell, who was a close friend at college, a fellow founding member of the party, and best man at his wedding. Legal philosophy Politically, Hardiman supported the liberal side in Ireland's debates over abortion, being active in the \\"anti- amendment\\" campaign during the 1982 Abortion Referendum and later represented the Well Woman Centre in the early 1990s. After his death, he was described by Joan Burton as a liberal on social issues.Tributes paid to Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman after sudden death But he could be an outspoken opponent of Political Correctness, such as when he rejected the Equality Authority's attempt to force Portmarnock Golf Club to accept women as full members. He also believed that certain decisions, such as those involving public spending, were better left to elected politicians rather than unelected judges, regardless of how unpopular that might sometimes be in the media (which he tended to hold in low esteem) and among what he described as the \\"chattering classes\\". One commentator wrote that \\"Hardiman‚Äôs greatest contribution ...was the steadfast defence of civil liberties and individual rights\\" and that \\"He was a champion of defendants' rights and a bulwark against any attempt by an Garda S√≠och√°na to abuse its powers\\". His concern for individual rights was not confined to Ireland: in February 2016, he criticized what he described as the radical undermining of the presumption of innocence, especially in sex cases, by the methods used in the UK's Operation Yewtree inquiry into historical sex allegations against celebrities, and he also criticized \\"experienced lawyer\\" and then US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for allegedly declaring in January that \\"every accuser was to be believed, only to amend her view when asked if it applied to women who had made allegations against her husband\\", former US President Bill Clinton. Key judgments Hardiman wrote a number of important judgments since joining the Court. He also presided (as does each Supreme Court judge on a rotating basis) over the Court of Criminal Appeal. The following is a selection of judgments delivered by Justice Hardiman, in reverse chronological order: ;2007 * O'Callaghan -v- Judge Mahon: dissent; holding that Tribunal of Inquiry should be prevented from further inquiring into the applicants; cites R -v- Lynch (1829) ‚Äì the Doneraile Conspiracy case ‚Äì in which by skilful cross-examination Daniel O'Connell secured acquittals on capital charges; concluded that the contrary approach \\"would represent a very marked coarsening of our standards of procedural fairness.\\" * Shortt -v- The Commissioner of An Garda S√≠och√°na: one of two judgments, in which the Court more than doubled (‚Ç¨1.9m to ‚Ç¨4.7m) the damages granted to a man wrongfully imprisoned for over two years after two members of the Garda S√≠och√°na concocted evidence against him * P.H. -v- D.P.P. ;2006 * D.P.P. -v- Anthony Barnes: discusses and restates the criminal law of self-defence in the case of burglary * McK. -v- Homan * N -v- Health Service Executive: one of five judgments given by the Court; this case concerned the circumstances in which a parent may exercise the right provided for in Irish law to rescind initial consent to adoption. * A. -v- The Governor of Arbour Hill Prison: one of five judgments; the case concerned a \\"collateral\\" challenge by a prisoner to the lawfulness of his detention following the judgment in C.C. -v- Ireland (see immediately below). * C.C. -v- Ireland: striking down as unconstitutional part of the law on statutory rape, due to the absence in any circumstances of a defence of honest mistake as to age. ;2005 * O'Callaghan -v- The Hon. Mr. Justice Mahon ;2003 * Gough -v- Neary * Lobe -v- Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform: one of seven judgments in a case concerning whether the State could deport the parents of Irish citizens who were still minors; the Court by a majority (5‚Äì2) dismissed the appeal and allowed the deportation of the family. ;2002 * Dunne -v- D.P.P.: one of a series of cases, beginning with Braddish v D.P.P., in which the Court considered the contours of the Garda S√≠och√°na's duty to seek out and preserve evidence relevant to a criminal trial. * Ardagh -v-. Maguire: this case concerned the procedures to be applied by a parliamentary inquiry into an incident in which members of the Garda S√≠och√°na shot dead a civilian, John Carthy. ;2001 * DPP -v-. Davis: on causation, and the relationship which must be shown between the injuries caused by the defendant and the death of the victim. Death Hardiman died on 7 March 2016 at the age of 64. The eulogy at his funeral, which took place in the Church of the Holy Name in Ranelagh, was delivered by Michael McDowell. He said: \\"The fates have robbed us of someone who simultaneously excelled in his many different personae as husband, father, grandfather, an original thinker, an advocate and, for so many who are here, simply that of a loyal friend.\\" President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina, US Ambassador Kevin O'Malley and Chief Justice Ms Justice Susan Denham all paid their respects. Ex-TDs Lucinda Creighton, Mary Harney, Des O'Malley and Pat Rabbitte were also among those who signed a book of condolence, with Taoiseach Enda Kenny represented by his aide-de-camp. Upon his death, his colleague Justices of the Supreme Court released an extensive statement acknowledging Hardiman's contributions to the court system and to the country.

History The Northern Stelae Park in Axum in 2002, with King Ezana's Stela at the centre and the Great Stela lying broken. (The Obelisk of Axum was returned later.) This monument, properly termed a stela (' or ' in the local Afroasiatic language) was carved and erected in the 4th century by subjects of the Kingdom of Aksum, an ancient civilization centered in the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands. The stelae are thought to be \\"markers\\" for underground burial chambers. The largest grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors; nobility would have smaller, less decorated stelae. King Ezana's Stela is likely to be the last example of this practice, which was abandoned after the Axumites adopted Christianity under King Ezana. Ezana was the first monarch of Axum to embrace the faith, following the teachings and examples of his childhood tutor, Frumentius. King Ezana's Stela is also the only one of the three major \\"royal\\" obelisks (the others being the Great Stela and the Obelisk of Axum) that was never broken.

Finished in 1968, it was considered an \\"architectural wonder\\" at the time. It contained a popular cinema \\"Fontana\\", which was closed in 1991.

Fontana is well-connected to the other parts of Belgrade as over ten lines of public transportation pass through the neighborhood. In March 2008, city government announced complete reconstruction of Block 1, including the old shopping complex \\"Fontana\\", which at time of construction was unofficial center of Novi Beograd. Reconstruction should be finished by the end of 2008, and it should include building of a public underground garage, renovation of the children playgrounds, green areas, fountain and ground level of \\"Fontana\\" center.

Serial Thriller (co-written by Divinyls' front woman Chrissy Amphlett) debuted on the ARIA chart in July at No.44 but fell out of the Top 100 the following week, the song had an electro-rock beat, contrasting Brielle's older material. The single's B-side, a DNA remix of forthcoming album track Oxygen, became an instant cult classic across Australia and New Zealand. On Chrissy Amphlett: \\"Chrissy is such a powerful and unashamedly truthful performer ‚Äì I have taken so much inspiration from her ‚Äì read her biography, if it does not inspire you to be true to yourself then nothing will.\\" The follow-up single Take It Off was released in March 2007 and peaked at #11 on the ARIA Club Chart after remix treatment by US house producer Andy Caldwell. It also gained national airplay as part of the Nova network's Unsigned initiative and in radio ads for the Leukemia Foundation's World's Greatest Shave campaign. Take It Off soared to the top of the Canadian BPM:TV Charts where it remained in the Top 10 for a number of weeks. Brielle became the first celebrity fashion ambassador for Supre's Fashion Rocks campaign, an initiative to fuse fashion, celebrity and music. Brielle featured heavily on Supre's promotional material including websites, brochures, internal TV network and in-store media and Brielle's favourite clothing items were marked with special \\"Brielle's fave\\" swingtags. Though an album, Other Side, was planned, it was not released at this time and promotional copies have become a highly sought-after item by dance music fans on illegal download sites because many of the tracks gained popularity and support during Brielle's extensive club tour. Initial previews of the album called it \\"...an Australian classic in waiting...\\" and \\"...a divine slice of Australian dance-pop...\\" The latter half of 2007 saw Brielle continuing her many charity commitments including a tour of the Solomon Islands to entertain Australian troops stationed overseas before returning to Sydney to record her first acoustic EP. On her Tour De Force: \\"I couldn't even begin to explain what an amazing experience this was... It was breathtaking... I felt incredibly honoured being able to share even just this short period of time with both the police, soldiers and the islanders... When you hear others say that this experience will change your life, you don't believe it until it happens to you and I am lost for words knowing that i was able to experience this while being surrounded by such wonderful and inspiring people...\\" Crossing The Line was released in September 2007 at Brielle's acoustic showcase hosted by The Vanguard (Newtown, Sydney) and features acoustic versions of Serial Thriller, the cult favourite Oxygen, unreleased album tracks Cybersexual and Mine plus new tracks written especially for the EP (Crossing The Line, Bang Bang). Brielle's acoustic rendition of Oxygen garnered particular attention due to its dramatic vocals and atmospheric production. In early 2008, Brielle was asked once again to perform a tour of duty and entertain Australian troops - this time in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tour was filmed by crews from Australian Story and aired on ABC1 as a two-part documentary telling the brave story of the performers and the heroic troops currently serving in these countries. Brielle is currently working the Australian live music scene and has many regular gigs (including The Vanguard, Newtown, Sydney and The Brass Monkey, Cronulla, Sydney) and can be regularly seen at industry events, both on the red carpet and supporting her fellow musicians.

It theatrically premiered on 3 March 2007. The film consists of three segments: \\"Cherry Blossom\\", \\"Cosmonaut\\", and \\"5 Centimeters per Second\\", each following a period in Takaki T≈çno's life and his relationships with the girls around him. The film was awarded Best Animated Feature Film at the 2007 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. It received a novelization in November 2007, and a manga adaption illustrated by Seike Yukiko in 2010. Plot The story is set in Japan, beginning in the 1990s up until the present day (2008), with each act centered on a boy named Takaki T≈çno. In 1991, Takaki T≈çno quickly befriends Akari Shinohara when she transfers to his elementary school in Tokyo. They grow closer to each other due to similar interests and attitudes; for instance, they both prefer to stay inside during recess due to their seasonal allergies. As a result, they form a strong bond; they speak to each other using their given names without any form of honorifics, which is a sign of deep friendship and familiarity in Japan. The room in Iwafune Station Upon graduating from elementary school in 1994, Akari moves to the nearby prefecture of Tochigi, due to her parents' jobs. The two keep in contact by writing letters but eventually begin to drift apart. When Takaki learns that his family will be moving to Kagoshima on the other side of the country the following year in 1995, he decides to personally go see Akari one last time since they will be too far apart to visit each other after moving. He also prepares a letter for Akari to confess his feelings for her. However, Takaki loses the letter during the journey and a severe snowstorm continuously delays his train for several hours. As the two finally meet and share their first kiss, Takaki realizes they will never be together again. Stranded in a shed due to the snowstorm, they fall asleep after talking late into the night. Takaki departs from the train station the next morning, and the two promise to continue writing to each other. As the train rolls away, Takaki decides that the loss of his letter is not important anymore after the kiss, while Akari silently looks at her own letter addressed to Takaki, which she decided not to give him. The high school in Tanegashima In 1999, Takaki is now in the third year of senior high in Tanegashima, where the Tanegashima Space Center is located. Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has been in love with him ever since meeting him in middle school but has never had the courage to confess her feelings. She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant of Kanae's feelings and only treats her as a good friend. Kanae observes that Takaki is always writing emails to someone or staring off into the distance as if searching for something far away. It is later shown Takaki's emails are not being sent to anyone, and he, in fact, deletes them after he finishes writing them. He also has recurring dreams which feature Akari. After a failed attempt to tell Takaki she loves him, Kanae realizes he is looking for something far beyond what she can offer and decides not to say anything, though she believes she will always love him. With such thoughts, she cries herself to sleep. It is 2008. Takaki is now a programmer in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Akari is preparing to marry another man. Takaki still longs for Akari to the detriment of his lifestyle. He receives a call from his current girlfriend but does not answer, signifying the relationship's end. Depressed, Takaki quits his job, unable to cope with his feelings for Akari. Akari goes through a box of her old possessions and finds the letter she had written to Takaki many years ago. Takaki finds himself in a convenience store reading a magazine about the decade long journey of the rocket launched in the 2nd act. Takaki and Akari begin a dual narration, both recalling a recent dream. In this dream, they relive their last meeting in the snow-filled Iwafune and remember the wish to someday watch the cherry blossoms together again. The train crossing in Tokyo One day while walking down the same road they had when they were children, Takaki and Akari appear to pass and recognize each other at the train crossing, the same place they had promised to watch the cherry blossoms together thirteen years ago, just before Akari moved to Tochigi. On opposite sides of the tracks, they stop and begin to look back, but passing trains cut off their view. Takaki waits for the trains to pass and finds that Akari is gone. After a moment, he smiles to himself and continues walking as the cherry blossoms stir in the train's wake. Characters ; : :Takaki is the central character of the film. Because of his parents' jobs, he is forced to move a lot. He and Akari become close friends, but when Akari moves away, they end up attending different junior high schools. In the second arc, he is shown to be an apt ky≈´d≈ç practitioner and a member of his school's ky≈´d≈ç club. ; : :Takaki's best friend and love interest in elementary school. Like Takaki, she and her family move a lot. After elementary school, she moves to Iwafune. Apparently she suggests living with her aunt in Tokyo in order to stay with Takaki, but her parents forbid this. For a while, she and Takaki keep in touch via post. ; : :A classmate of Takaki in high school. She has been in love with Takaki since he began attending her junior high school, but cannot express her feelings to him. Kanae loves to surf and rides a moped to school. She doesn't know what she wants to do with her future. Her older sister is a teacher at her high school. In the manga, she is seen working as a nurse after the events depicted in the film.  Production  Makoto Shinkai had expressed that, unlike his past works, there would be no fantasy or science fiction elements in this film. Instead, the feature film would attempt to present the real world from a different perspective. Shinkai's film gives a realistic view of the struggles many people have to face: time, space, people, and love. The title 5 Centimeters per Second comes from the speed at which cherry blossoms petals fall, petals being a metaphorical representation of humans, reminiscent of the slowness of life and how people often start together but slowly drift into their separate ways. The movie marks the first time Shinkai has worked closely with a full staff of animators and artists. =Staff=Director, Writer and Original Creator: Makoto Shinkai *Character Design and Chief Animation Director: Takayo Nishimura *Background Art: Takumi Tanji, Ryoko Majima *Music: Tenmon *Production and Distribution: CoMix Wave, Inc.

The film was Japan's fourth most popular Blu-ray film in 2008. Mania.com lists 5 Centimeters per Second as the best anime not by Hayao Miyazaki. The Japan Timess Mark Schilling commends Shinkai saying that he is better than Miyazaki \\"at piercing the veil of the everyday to reveal a poignant, evanescent beauty most of us notice only in rare moments.\\" Anime News Network's Bamboo Dong commends the anime for its \\"heartbreakingly gorgeous\\" piano score composed by Tenmon, which \\"contributes to the dreamlike quality that the film has\\". She also comments that film \\"never comes out and tells you what the characters are feeling. It never follows a strict storyline, but between the interactions on the screen and well-timed shots of lonely landscapes, everything is as clear as night and day\\". Mania.com's Chris Beveridge criticises the anime for its aliasing as well as it \\"seems to get a fairly low bitrate during a lot of it which leads to some noisy and overly grainy feeling areas. The film has so many lush colors to it that a lot of them start to show too much noise at times which is almost as distracting as the aliasing.\\" Theron Martin reviewing for Anime News Network commends \\"The production [which] also excels in its use of sound effects, especially in the bow-shooting scenes in Part 2\\".

He lives and works in Venice, California.Christine Lennon (June 19, 2014), Glen Luchford Opens the Rose Hotel in Venice, Calif. Wall Street Journal. A self-taught photographer, Brighton-born Luchford left school at 15 and moved to London, where he worked at a hair salon. He was one of the youngest photographers to work for The Face Magazine aged just 20. Luchford first signed with New York based agency Art + Commerce at the age of 24. He was one of the first photographers to collaborate with model Kate Moss. In 1997, he signed exclusively to Prada, and has since shot advertising campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Chlo√©, Lanvin, Calvin Klein, and Gucci. He has collaborated extensively with British artist Jenny Saville with shows at the Gagosian Gallery. Luchford's work has also been showed and featured in the permanent collection of MoMA, Victoria and Albert Museum, The Getty Museum, and the Hermitage Museum. His editorial work has been featured in magazines such as The Face, Arena, i-D, and British, French, American, Italian Vogue magazines, Harper's Bazaar, and Self Service Magazine. Luchford's style is influenced by his love of cinema. His signature look is to work with cinematic lighting, both on location and in studio. Luchford was the first to bring this aesthetic into fashion photography. In 2001, Luchford directed the film Here to Where, about a filmmaker wanting to make a film about a man stranded at an airport. Nominated for the Michael Powell award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the film is considered to be an inspiration for Steven Spielberg's The Terminal. In 2009 Luchford completed his first solo monograph with Steidl/Dangin. In the same year, Luchford joined one of the leading artist management agencies Art Partner. Luchford has published six books, Jenny Saville & Glen Luchford: Closed Contact, Gagosian Gallery (2002), Glen Luchford (2009), Damaged Negatives (2013), Glen Luchford: Pictorialism (2014), which chronicles thirty-three years of his career and features both his earliest photographs and his most well-known ones. His latest book, The Agony and the Ecstasy, was published in 2018. Most recently, Luchford collaborated with Alessandro Michele on the re-branding of Gucci after Michele's appointment as the brand's Creative Director in 2015. He photographed the designer‚Äôs first campaigns, and created a brand new image of Gucci with Michele. His cinematic approach on the images took Gucci away from the sexualised campaigns of Michele‚Äôs predecessor Frida Giannini and the Tom Ford era. He photographed Gucci's campaigns until Spring Summer 2020. Outside of his photography and film work, Luchford has launched multiple businesses; in 2014 he bought and renovated The Rose Hotel in Venice, California, which he then sold in September 2019. Additionally, he owns a post production company called Venice Post.

Browne with Don Turnbull. The module details a mysterious abandoned mansion at the edge of a town called Saltmarsh, and the secrets contained therein. The adventure is set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh received positive reviews from critics. Plot summary The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh can be played by five to ten characters of 1st-3rd levels. The module includes optional pre-generated first level characters for use by the players. The scenario is the first of the Underwater (U) series of modules set in Saltmarsh, and details a ghostly ship and the haunted mansion of an evil alchemist. The module sleeve contains the following description: The module is divided into two parts, The Haunted House and Sea Ghost, which are intended to be played consecutively. The first part is set in the town of Saltmarsh and deals with unraveling the secret of the haunted house that lies on the edge of town. The abandoned, dilapidated mansion of an evil alchemist has been the subject of rumors about hauntings and treasure. The second part of the module follows on from the first, expanding on the concept. (preview) Publication history The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh is the first installment in a series of three modules designed and developed in the United Kingdom, for beginning adventures with AD&D; rules. The adventure was written by David J. Browne with Don Turnbull, and published in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder. The publication contains large-scale maps, a full background story, and detailed encounter descriptions for the players and Dungeon Master (DM). The module serves as the introduction to an underwater campaign set in the town of Saltmarsh, which the DM can design from the guidelines provided. The next two modules, Danger at Dunwater and The Final Enemy, continue on from this adventure. Reception The module was positively reviewed in Issue No. 35 of White Dwarf magazine by Jim Bambra, who scored it 9 out of 10 and described it as entertaining and interesting. Bambra criticized how the first-level characters provided with the module come equipped with magic items: \\"I fail to see how this can be justified, as the module is not difficult enough to warrant the bestowal of magic before play even begins. Magic items should be found by players as treasure and not come as handouts from the DM.\\" Bambra noted that the adventure's main thrust engages the players' problem solving skills, forcing them to piece clues together, and that the encounters in the adventure should present no problems to an intelligent party. Overall, he felt that \\"TSR (UK) are to be congratulated on their first module, the series should prove to be interesting and entertaining.\\" The module was ranked the 27th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. Freelance gaming author James Maliszewski calls it \\"one of the best low-level modules ever written for Dungeons & Dragons\\" and \\"a superb example of adventure design\\". He listed the positive elements of the module as \\"the very matter-of-fact way it portrays a fantasy world\\" and the new spin it gives to \\"the standard low-level D&D; tropes\\". Ken Denmead of Wired listed the module as one of the \\"Top 10 D&D; Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend\\". According to Denmead, this was \\"the Scooby Doo episode of D&D; modules. Instead of a good old dungeon crawl, players got to explore a big old spooky house, and deal with all sorts of annoying wandering monsters, as well as traps and illusions.\\" References ;Reviews: *Different Worlds No. 20 (1982) *Fantasy Gamer No. 2 (1983) External linksReview at RPGnet Category:Greyhawk modules ","title":"The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh"},{"id":"5985627","title":"Gameboys"},{"id":"5985640","text":"Gaius Livius Marcus Aemiliani f.

He was then elected consul for 147 BC, alongside Scipio Aemilianus, who was possibly his first cousin.Broughton, pg. 463; Boren, pg. 29 As the Third Punic War was raging, there was enormous concern in Rome about who was going to be assigned the command of the Roman forces against Carthage. Drusus, as was the custom, requested that lots be drawn to assign the provinces to the respective consuls. This was vetoed by one of the plebeian tribunes, who proposed that the assignment of the provinces be put before the concilium Plebis.

Drusus composed works of great use to students of law, and was cited by subsequent writers on the law.

Gladwin Harold Sterling Gladwin (1883‚Äì1983Haury, E. W., and J. J. Reid, 'Harold Sterling Gladwin, 1883-1983'. Kiva 50 (1985), pp. 271-283) was an American archaeologist, anthropologist, and stockbroker born in New York City. Introduction Harold Sterling Gladwin was an early twentieth century archaeologist that specialized in Southwestern archaeology of the United States. He also was known for his famed excavations at Snaketown, Arizona, in which he accomplished several publications on this topic; his theories on migration to the New World from Asia also gained attention. Background Born in New York City in 1883, Harold worked in the city as a stockbroker from 1908 to 1922, his first successful career. However, in 1922 Sterling decided to move west to California, and there he began work at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, taking a special interest in the mutations of butterflies. Harold's interest in insects was soon replaced with an interest in American archaeology and, by 1924, he had become friends with A.V. Kidder, the noted archaeologist of the Southwestern United States; from this point on, Gladwin's work was in archaeology.Murray, Tim. ‚ÄúHarold Sterling Gladwin.\\" Encyclopedia of Archaeology. ABC CLIO, Santa Barbara, California; 2001: p.588. Early work Taking special interest in pottery shards and other refuse, Gladwin began to piece together theories on Hohokam culture as he excavated Casa Grande in 1927 in Arizona. Finding that the local Hohokam red-on-buff pottery artifacts were mixed with polychromes of the Salado Culture, Gladwin wondered how and why the two distinctive pottery types were together with no evidence for conflict between the Hohokam cultures of the Gila Basin and the Salado cultures of the Tonto Basin. Gladwin's excavations in southern Arizona helped to renew an interest in this area that had been nearly forgotten since Frank Cushing had done his own excavations there in the late nineteenth century. In 1928, Harold and his future wife, Winifred, founded the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation over the remains of a pueblo that the two had excavated together. As work in the area grew, the Gladwins began to move around the Southwest in search of clues about the origins of the prehistoric inhabitants. The Arizona State Museum Library & Archives holds the records to the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation. The finding aid for this collection is located on Arizona Archives Online. New Method devised Casas Grandes olla, donated by Gladwin to MIA From the Gila Pueblo, the Gladwins conducted research on Southwestern prehistory for over twenty years before donating the facility to the University of Arizona in 1951.Murray, Tim. ‚ÄúHarold Sterling Gladwin.‚Äù Encyclopedia of Archaeology. ABC CLIO, Santa Barbara, California; 2001: p.588. In the years while they conducted their research, Harold Gladwin and his wife traveled throughout the Southwest conducting numerous excavations at sites such as: Snaketown, near Phoenix, Casa Grande, Flagstaff, Chaco Canyon, and various places throughout Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas.Murray, Tim. ‚ÄúHarold Sterling Gladwin.‚Äù Encyclopedia of Archaeology. ABC CLIO, Santa Barbara, California; 2001: p.588. Through their numerous excavations, the two came up with a new ‚Äúmethod for designation of cultures,‚Äù which included taking a look at the current linguistic ‚Äústocks‚Äù of the area and, through a system of roots stems, branches, phases, and terms, putting these ‚Äústocks‚Äù into a context of patterns of the Southwestern region. The Snaketown excavations Arguably Gladwin's most famous excavations took place outside Phoenix at a place called Snaketown, which delved into the Hohokam culture. After having a chance meeting with the descendants of this culture in 1927, Gladwin wanted to find the roots of these people that the Pima referred to as Hohokam, or ‚Äúthose who had gone.‚Äù Finding that these people had left little behind in terms of their modes of travel and pathways, Gladwin found difficulty in locating clues to their culture while he was in the Gila Basin. After visiting numerous prehistoric sites (in his own words, thousands of sitesGladwin, Harold S. and Winifred. ‚ÄúA Method for Designation of Cultures and Their Variation.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Lancaster Press, Inc., Lancaster, PA; 1934: pp. 1-10.), Gladwin and his colleagues decided upon Snaketown as their focal point for excavations into this culture. The team decided that this site would be the most rewarding, for it had been relatively untouched by others, especially looters. The excavation began in 1934, and the first results were published four years later. In the first publication, Gladwin and his team took a special interest in the various types of pottery, figurines, stone tools, and shells, and the reference to each time period that they could identify.Gladwin, Harold S. and Winifred; Haury; and Sayles. ‚ÄúExcavations at Snaketown: Material Culture.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1938: pp. 1-11. This site remained a focus for Gladwin for years to come, and he reevaluated his results and republished his works on this site many times in order to better comprehend and better inform the archaeological community of its importance. Taking into account the rapid increase of information about Southwestern cultures and the increase in accuracy of dating methods, Gladwin admitted that he and his team originally had made some judgments and suppositions incompatible with the current criteria of now eleven years later. This publication exemplifies Gladwin's commitment to the field of archaeology, for in his publications he typically admitted where he had gone wrong, and where he needed to keep an open mind in his work. It was through his constant revisions and republications that Gladwin was able to help decipher the lost culture of the Hohokam.Gladwin, Harold Sterling. ‚ÄúExcavations at Snaketown: Reviews and Conclusions.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1948: pp. 1-5. The Snaketown excavations are now protected by the Hohokam Pima National Monument. Most of the archaeological excavations were backfilled to protect the site for future research. A scale model of the original Snaketown community is held at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, while artifacts from excavations are housed in the Arizona State Museum in Tucson. Publications and excavations Gladwin kept publishing on various important archaeological topics throughout his life, up until 1975. Some of his most read works include: Tree Ring Analysis,Gladwin, Harold Sterling. ‚ÄúTree Ring Analysis: Problems of Dating.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1946: pp.1-21.Gladwin, Harold Sterling. ‚ÄúTree Ring Analysis: Tree-rings and Droughts.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1952: pp 1-33.

Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1945: pp. 1-152. Of these publications, Tree Ring Analysis was revised and republished many times by Gladwin, as he would argue with the methods of other archaeologists, or learn more detail into the art of tree ring dating. Particularly in his 1946 publication on the problems of tree ring dating, Gladwin used his own data from the Gila Basin to dispute dates that A.E. Douglass had prescribed to certain archaeological evidence. While Gladwin consistently sought out information that prescribed to his own view of dendrochronology, to this day, he is seen as somewhat of a novice on the topic. Nonetheless, in his publications, Gladwin takes a careful consideration of the methods employed by him and others, as to bring special attention to the critical thinking that one must undertake as an archaeologist.Gladwin, Harold Sterling. ‚ÄúTree Ring Analysis: Problems of Dating.‚Äù Medallion Papers. Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona; 1946: pp.1-21. One of Gladwin's most famous publications was Men out of Asia. In this novel-like publication, Gladwin describes his view on anthropology, and proposes a theory on the origins of peoples in the Americas, as a result of ‚Äúmultitudinous migrations.‚Äù This book is filled with cartoon-like representations of what Gladwin thought the first occupants of North America and their descendants looked like. This publication gives insight into Gladwin's own humor and the love he had for this subject material.Gladwin, Harold Sterling. Men Out of Asia. Whittlesey House, New York City; 1947: pp. vii-361. Conclusion Harold Sterling Gladwin and his wife Winifred spent the better portion of their lives in a commitment to archaeology and its ever-changing ways. From his early publications, to their revisions, Gladwin was ever critical of his own and his colleagues findings and speculations. From their work throughout the Southwestern United States, the Gladwins introduced new information and archaeological techniques into the scientific community that may have gone undiscovered for years.

In 1926 he co-founded, later served as a vice-chairman and during 1932-34 as a chairman of the international standards organization ISA (later ISO) in Basel, Switzerland. List had initiated work on conversion tables between metric system and Imperial units. His was successful in effort to standardize voltages for transmission lines in Czechoslovakia in 1919 (220/380V for low voltage and 22kV/100kV for high-voltage lines) and power plug sockets. Importance List had helped to establish very high level of technical standardisation in Czechoslovakia and this level was kept even over communist era. He was interested and participated in wide array of activities, in spite of chronic health problems. Today, a building in technological park and a student dormitory in Brno are named after List.

He was praetor in 176 BC. He did not go to his province of Sardinia because he did not want to upset the success that the propraetor, Titus Aebutius, was enjoying.

He was consul for the year 173 BC, together with Lucius Postumius Albinus.Livy, xli.28. Popillius went to his province and started fighting a tribe of Ligurians in Northern Italy, the Statellati. He fought a bloody battle at the town of Carystum, which came to a conclusion when Popillius sent in the cavalry that broke through the Ligurian lines. The cavalry then slew many of the men trying to flee to the city. The Romans killed 10,000 Ligurians and took 700 prisoner while losing 3,000 themselves.Livy, xlii.7. The remaining Ligurians, thinking that Popillius would be lenient, surrendered themselves. Popillius, however, destroyed their town and sold them and their property. The Senate was outraged when it heard of the treatment shown to a people who had not taken up arms against Rome and were attacked without provocation. The Senate demanded that Popillius restore the Ligurians to their homes and property.Livy, xlii.8 Popillius was himself outraged and refused to obey the Senate's commands. He returned to Rome and attacked the Senate for their actions. He claimed that it should have given him a thanksgiving instead of ordering him to return his spoils to his victims. Many senators again attacked him and his actions so Popillius returned to his province having failed to gain the support of the Senate.Livy, xlii.9. The following year, Popillius continued his aggressions against the Statellati killing 6,000 more in battle. His actions caused the rest of the Ligurians to rise up in arms. In response the Senate passed a decree that anyone hindering the return of the Statellati to their freedom would face trial. Popillius refused to return to Rome until a tribune of the plebs promised to bring him to trial in absentia. Popillius was tried, but the trial came to nothing due to the influence of his brother, the consul for the year, and other Popillii.Livy, xlii.21-22.

The group's membership was mainly from the Women's Freedom League, a group made up of suffragettes. Many of its members were also pacifists. The Women's Peace Council was founded in 1915 because the leaders of the Women's Freedom League believed that the British government's anti-war efforts were insufficient in ending conflict during World War I and they wanted to bring about negotiated peace. The newly-formed Women's Peace Council is a rebirth of the Women's Peace Council from World War I, but it is now a global organization dedicated to peace and well-being, led by women. Their Facebook page describes the purpose of the group as follows: \\"The Women‚Äôs Peace Council will bring together people from different backgrounds to imagine a world without fear and hatred.\\" The co-founders of the newly-formed Council are Tezikiah Gabriel, Jayne Hillman, and Deborah Greene. The Charter Members include Dimah Mahmoud, Rosa Davis, Kath Knight, Tracy Chapman, and Jennifer Carolyn King.  Current-Day Activism  3 June 2019: The Women's Peace Council organized the \\"People's Banquet,\\" or \\"Peace banquet,\\" held in Parliament Square in London, to protest the visit of President Trump and his participation in the state banquet. This event was a partnership between the Women's Peace Council and ActionAid UK. Those participating were asked to wear blue and bring white flowers to represent peace. Speakers, singers, and other performers were part of the event, including a feminist fortune-teller.  Notable Members  Charlotte Despard: Women's Peace Council member and notable British suffragette. Despard was one of the original organizers for the Women's Freedom League and one of the organizers of the Women's Peace Crusade in 1916. Despard was also the 1918 Labour Party candidate in Battersea in the election after World War I, but she lost the election due to her unpopular pacifist, anti-war political views. She then went on to become the secretary for the Friends of Soviet Russia organization in 1930. Helen Crawfurd: Member of the Women's Peace Council and one of the organizers of the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League in 1915. She was also one of the organizers for the Women's Peace Crusade in 1916. In 1920 she was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and in 1927 she helped establish the League Against Imperialism. Teresa Billington-Greig: A member of the Women's Freedom League who went on to join the Women's Peace Council. She was appointed organizer of the Independent Labour Party in Manchester in 1904 and spent much of her life fighting for the rights of working-class women. Margaret Grace Bondfield: Member of the Women's Peace Council and Britain's first female cabinet minister; she served as the Minister of Labor in a government lead by the Labour Party. Bondfield dedicated her life to working to improve conditions and salaries for working women and campaigning for women's right to vote. In 1906, she helped to found the Women's Labour League and held positions in the Adult Suffrage Society, the National Union of Shop Assistants, and the Women's Labor League.  Timeline  1907 ‚Äì Official members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), which is a UK based organization, questioned Emmeline Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst, the leaders of WSPU. Members felt as though their leading members had too much influence over the organization. Months later in a September conference, Emmeline Pankhurst made it clear she'd continue being in charge of WSPU. Also in 1907 ‚Äì Close to 80 members left the WSPU and formed the Women's Freedom League (WFL), which was also a militant organization. 1914 ‚Äì By this point there were about 4,000 members within the WFL, most pacifists, and so they turned down any chance to be involved in British Army's recruitment campaign. The WFL organization as a whole felt as though the government was not doing enough to bring the war to an end. It is because of this that they then supported the Women's Peace Crusade's campaign for negotiated peace. 4 August 1914 ‚Äì It was two days after the British government declared war on Germany that the National Union of Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) declared no political activity would be permitted until the conflict was over. 1915 - Those within the Women's Freedom League founded the Women's Peace Council for a negotiated peace.

The lady was a vampiric spirit before she passed away and was devoured by her grandchild. They say Badmaarag has two souls, while others say she doesn't have any. She struggled to transform into a vampire. She noticed physical difference when she started puberty. Deja-vu visions were noticeable. She gave up her humanity and said her vows in between two trees \\"From this day i shall be human no more. With this apple in my hand, i represent my soul. With this figure on the apple, i represent my humanity in me. With this dirt under me, i represent my vampires. Hear me clearly, when the time comes, on the last day i shall be a vampire! Once the apple is decomposed, the human in me shall be long gone! My soul shall never return as it will be replaced by a demon. I shall never be the same again as i will be a vampire. I now bury the apple, the tree shall not be lonely as i will visit.\\" She promised to take care of the tree till the last day of her humanity and said the vows \\"Oh! My child, you are lonely here! Fear not as i shall keep thee company, will visit you till the last day of thy humanity. Oh! My child, you are sick! Fear not as i shall aid you, will bring you water till the last day of thy humanity. Oh! My child, you need sun! Fear not as i shall be your light, will light your way till the last day of thy humanity. You have my words, rest now as i will protect you.\\" With these vows she decided to visit the tree till the last day of her humanity. The day came quickly as the apple was too small. Her biggest mistake was breaking her promise to take care of the tree. She is now known as the New Vampire Queen as some say she carries Lilith's soul energy. Beware! She looks younger than her age! Do not let her fool you! Do not go to her house! Do not stay alone with her in the same room! Do not disrespect her! Do not go on her bad side!

It was introduced in 1945 as a two-cylinder rebuild (with diagram 100A boiler) of the three-cylinder LNER Class B17. Ten were rebuilt from Class B17 but no more were rebuilt because of the success of the LNER Thompson Class B1. Numbering The LNER renumbered its locomotive stock during the period that these locomotives were being rebuilt, so some were renumbered at the time that they were rebuilt, some before rebuilding, and some after rebuilding. The renumbering plan for class B2 was the same as for class B17: in each case the first two digits were altered from 28 to 16. Thus 2803 became 1603 at rebuilding in October 1946; 2807 had already become 1607 (December 1946) prior to rebuilding in May 1947; and 2814 (rebuilt November 1946) became 1614 in December 1946. Between 1948 and 1950, British Railways increased these numbers by 60000; no. 61644 was so renumbered at the time of its rebuilding in March 1949.

No. 1671, based at Cambridge, was the official Royal engine, used to haul specials to and from , which was the nearest station to Sandringham; for this purpose it was renamed Royal Sovereign in April 1946. When this locomotive was unavailable, no. 61617 Ford Castle was the designated reserve, and it was the latter which was one of the locomotives used to haul the funeral train of King George VI on 11 February 1952. This locomotive was used from Wolferton as far as ; the train was hauled from there to King's Cross by BR standard class 7 70000 Britannia. The second renaming occurred after the withdrawal of 61671 in September 1958: in October, the name Royal Sovereign was transferred to no. 61632, which then became the official Royal engine.

Family He was apparently the son of Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 196 BC), censor in 189 BC and the grandson of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the five-times consul. Career In 169 BC, he served as a praetor, being assigned to Hither and Farther Spain.Livy, XLIII.14-15 In 155 BC, he celebrated a triumph against the Apuani. In 152 BC he assumed his third Consulship and replaced the previous Consul, Quintus Fulvius Nobilior, in his command against the Celtiberians in Spain.Appian, Roman History, Book 6 'The Wars in Spain,' s.48 Having arrived with reinforcements, he negotiated the surrender of Ocilis and defeated the Nergobriges, before they and the other Celtiberian tribes of the Arevaci, the Belli, and the Titthi, sued for peace with Rome. Marcellus sent ambassadors back to the Senate in Rome, urging them to accept the peace proposals and end the long war in Spain. The Senate however, refused and began gathering a new army to be again sent to Spain the following year, appointing Lucius Licinius Lucullus, Consul-Elect for 151 BC, to replace Marcellus once his term as Consul expired.Appian, Roman History, Book 6 'The Wars in Spain,' s.49 Upon learning of this, Marcellus nevertheless remained resolved to make peace in Spain and end the war before Lucullus' arrival. However, the Arevaci then attacked Nergobriga, the city of the Nergobriges, and broke the truce agreed with Marcellus. In retaliation, the Romans marched to besiege the Arevaci capital of Numantia; however, before the assault could begin, the Numantines re-opened negotiations for peace and, in a conference with Marcellus, the Numantine leader, Litenno, offered to make peace with Rome on behalf of the Arevaci, Belli and Titthi. Delighted, Marcellus accepted the offer and, the tribes having handed over the required hostages and money as guarantees that they would not break their promise, concluded the war in Spain before Lucullus and his army arrived.Appian, Roman History, Book 6 'The Wars in Spain,' s.50 City founder He founded Corduba (Cordoba) sometime in the 160s or 150s.

Accessed 2017-02-07. http://www.stat.fi/tup/julkaisut/tiedostot/julkaisuluettelo/yyti_stv_201600_2016_16179_net.pdf The archipelago is connected to Turku archipelago in the east (Finnish: Turunmaan saaristo, Swedish: √Öbolands sk√§rg√•rd) ‚Äî the archipelago adjacent to the southwest coast of Finland. The islands' landmass occupies a total land area of , and a total area, including inland water and sea areas, of . Its highest point is Orrdalsklint in Saltvik at 129.1 m above sea level. √Öland has nearly 400 lakes of over 0.25 hectare. The surface of the islands are generally rocky, with red and pink granite peppered with quartz crystals predominating. The soil is thin, stripped away by retreating glaciers at the end of the most recent ice age. Despite this, the presence of shell beds around the coasts of many of the islands has noticeably increased the fertility of the soil. The coast of √Öland is deeply indented by bays and fjords, which form excellent sheltered harbours for vessels of draught not exceeding 19 ft. The most notable harbour is at Yttern√§s. The large islands of Ecker√∂, Lemland, and Lumparland are separated from √Öland and each other by narrow shallow straits. The islands of F√∂lgl√∂, V√•rd√∂, and the archipelago of Geta are more massive, with steep cliffs and a less indented coastline. Many small lakes exist on the larger islands. Ninety per cent of the population live on Fasta √Öland (the Main Island), also the site of the capital town of Mariehamn. Fasta √Öland is the largest island in the archipelago, although its exact size is in some dispute owing to its irregular shape and coastline. Estimates range from 740 square kilometres to 879 square kilometres to over 1,010 square kilometres, depending on what is included or excluded. Flora and fauna The mildness of the climate and the richness of the soil tend to the growth of a more luxuriant vegetation than on the mainland of Finland. Pines and firs, birch, aspen, elm, ash, and lime grow, and oaks occur in small woods all over √Öland. Traditionally, timber was exported for shipbuilding, and local clay was used in the tile and brickworks on √Öland. Flocks of seabirds live on the rocky islets. Traditionally, migratory birds were hunted by the inhabitants, but the native sea-birds were protected, and their eggs used as food. The islets of L√•gsk√§r, Kl√•fsk√§r and Signilsk√§r were the traditional home to colonies of eider-duck, whose down was collected from the nests after the young had left, for export.  Mapping  A transnational Euroregion encompasses √Öland and nearby coastal archipelagoes (sk√§rg√•rdar). During the √Öland crisis, the parties sought support from different maps of the islands. On the Swedish map, the most densely populated main island dominated, and many skerries were left out. On the Finnish map, a lot of smaller islands or skerries were, for technical reasons, given a slightly exaggerated size. The Swedish map made the islands appear to be closer to the mainland of Sweden than to Finland; the Finnish map stressed the continuity of the archipelago between the main island and mainland Finland, while a greater gap appeared between the islands and the archipelago on the Swedish side. Although both Finns and Swedes argued for their respective interpretations, in retrospect it is hard to say that one is more correct than the other. One consequence is the oft-repeated number of \\"over 6,000\\" skerries, that was given authority by the outcome of the arbitration.

The name \\"Lyse\\" is derived from Lysefjorden near which the building stood. The abbey lies at the southern base of the Lyshornet mountain. Pre-Reformation Lyse Abbey was founded in 1146 by Sigurd, Bishop of the Ancient Diocese of Bergen, on farmland that he owned, as the Christianisation of Norway was nearing completion. The first monks were brought from Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire, England. This was the first Cistercian monastery in Norway and was modelled on others built in England and France. As with all Cistercians, the monks took a vow of poverty. Renouncing all sources of income except from farming, they developed considerable skill in farming operations and management. Over time, this led to the abbey acquiring many other farms in the area, making it ever more rich and powerful. In all, the monastery had about 50 other farms in Os with at least as many more in other areas. After the Reformation The abbey was dissolved in 1536 when Christian III of Denmark decreed Lutheranism to be the state religion of Norway. The abbey's possessions were confiscated, becoming the property of the king. Soapstone made up much of the building material. Over the next two centuries, the stones of the monastery structures were gradually removed and contributed to buildings such as the Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen, and Kronborg Castle in Helsing√∏r in Denmark. The monastery today The ruins of the buildings were excavated in 1822 and 1838 and restored around 1930. The ruins are protected as a national monument and archaeological work to preserve and record the site continues. The monastery is a well-visited tourist site with good nature walks nearby. It is common for couples today to be married at the ruins, or at least to have wedding photographs taken there.

He writes under a pen name in which his first name Yoshihiro is spelled out in hiragana („Çà„Åó„Å≤„Çç). Takahashi was born September 18, 1953, in Higashinaruse, Akita. He was very interested in drawing coming of age related themes, and, in the 1960s, started publishing small comics in several newspapers and magazines. His first manga was Shitamachi Benkei, but his breakthrough came in 1984 when he published the popular manga Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin, also known as Silver Fang, or Silver Fang Legend Gin, the story about a dog who goes in search of other dogs to fight a bear named Akakabuto. He got the idea in 1980 when he read an article about domestic dogs that ran away from their owners and lived as wild dogs in the mountains. The pure idea fascinated him, which led him to create the manga about the puppy. In 1987, the series won the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen manga. Takahashi started to publish the sequel, Ginga Densetsu Weed, in 1999 and it soon became a hit as well as an anime which aired on September 17, 2005. He has been touted as the first manga artist to draw manga featuring a puppy as hero.Ginga Legend Weed vol. 1, published by ComicsOne, the text inside the back cover Takahashi was the guest of honour at the Finnish role-playing and anime fan convention Tracon in Tampere on September 3 and 4 2011.

Early life and career Royal studied at St. Mary's Jesuit college in Montreal. His early publishing career included a term as editor of Montreal's Minerve from 1857 to 1859. He then founded and published other Montreal-based publications such as L'Ordre (1859‚Äì1860), La Revue Canadienne (1864) and Le Nouveau Monde (1867, editor-in-chief). Soon after moving to Manitoba, Royal founded Le Metis and operated that publication from 1871 to 1882 after which its new owner changed its title to Le Manitoba. His legal career began in Lower Canada where he was called to that province's bar in 1864. He joined the Manitoba bar in 1871 after moving to that province. In 1880, Royal left legal practice. Political career In the 1870 Manitoba provincial elections, he was acclaimed to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the riding St Fran√ßois Xavier West, and in 1871 he was unanimously chosen speaker. From 1874 to 1876, he was the Provincial Secretary and Minister of Public Works. From 1876 to 1878, he was the Attorney General. In 1878, he was the Minister of Public Works. In an 1879 by-election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the Manitoba riding of Provencher. A Conservative, he was re-elected in 1882 and 1887. Royal was appointed to, and served as a member on the Temporary North-West Council, the first legislature of the Northwest Territories from 1872 to 1876. He would later serve as the Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories from 1888 to 1893. Later life In December 1894, Royal returned to La Minerve where he became editor- in-chief.

He was the son of the famous general Marcus Claudius Marcellus (killed 208 BC), and possibly father of the three-time consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC). Marcellus first appears in Livy's history when his father, then curule aedile, brought an action before the senate against his colleague Scantinius Capitolinus who had made improper advances to the young and beautiful boy. The younger Marcellus, despite his evident embarrassment, convinced the senate of the man's guilt and his father was recompensed with some articles of silver which he dedicated to a temple. Marcellus would have been at least seven, and probably over 13 at the time of the incident (c. 226 BC). The relation of this case to the Lex Scantinia is vexed, since a Roman law was named after its proposer, and never a defendant.Elaine Fantham, \\"Stuprum: Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome,\\" in Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), pp. 137‚Äì138; Eva Cantarella, Bisexuality in the Ancient World (Yale University Press, 1992), pp. 110‚Äì111. Like his coevals, Marcellus fought in the Second Punic War, probably accompanying his father on various military campaigns, including the famous campaign against Syracuse. He was military tribune under his father, when the two consuls were ambushed in 208 BC resulting in his father's death and the other consul's severe injury. Marcellus himself was badly wounded; his father's body was subsequently returned by Hannibal to the son. In 204 BC Marcellus was a tribune of the plebs, appointed to lead a commission (also including Cato) to investigate charges made against Scipio Africanus. The charges were dismissed, and it is unclear what relationship, if any, existed between the two men. (Marcellus's father and Scipio's uncle had been co-consuls in 222 BC).

Robert at home Robert's estate was inherited by his nephew Jean Stewart and an inventory was made of Robert's goods in the Ch√¢teaux of Aubigny, La Verrerie and du Crotet in 1544, including Robert's tapestries, books, silver and weapons. Robert had two silk and leather purses made in the Scottish fashion, a Spanish guitar, and Turkish carpets. The inventory also includes a scarlet and a shot satin farthingale. Tapestry subjects at Aubigny included seven \\"park\\" and seven hunting scenes, the Nine Worthies, Nebuchadnezzar in nine scenes, seven Sibyls, single pieces of verdure and Hercules, and a set of seven new tapestries of birds and wild beasts. There were three old sets tapestries. Famous people were embroidered on six hangings of green damask, two of these had a single figure, another pair showed a couple, while two showed four characters. These hangings were augmented with more green damask to complete a room. There were several other hangings worked with a needle. The inventory is significant because it details in which rooms these tapestries and other furnishings were used.Elizabeth Bonner, Documents sur Robert Stuart Seigneur d'Aubigny (1508-1544) Guerrier et courtisan au service de Louis XII et de Fran√ßois Ier (Paris, 2011), 1-26.

They are sometimes known as Asian toads, metacarpal-tubercled toads, or slender litter frogs, although many species-specific common names do not follow these conventions, and many species do not have common names. They are widely distributed in southeastern and eastern Asia, from southern China and northeastern India to the Malay Peninsula and Borneo. Leptolalax are typically small and have a cryptic colour pattern and no obvious morphological characters useful in systematic studies. Consequently, both molecular genetic analyses and analysis of advertisement calls by male frogs have been important in identifying new species. Fujian Asian Toad Two subgenera are recognized: Leptolalax and Lalos (the latter was first named as Lalax, but the name was already occupied). Lalos has a more northern distribution and only includes species from the continental Asia, whereas Leptolalax includes all the species from Borneo (Leptolalax arayai, Leptolalax dringi, Leptolalax fritinniens, Leptolalax gracilis, Leptolalax hamidi, Leptolalax maurus, Leptolalax sabahmontanus, Leptolalax marmoratus and Leptolalax pictusA Field Guide to the Frogs of Borneo, Third Edition) as well as few continental species (Leptolalax croceus, Leptolalax melicus) and Leptolalax kajangensis from Tioman Island, at least provisionally. Most Leptolalax species have been reported from very small areas and only a few species have large areas of occurrence. Whether this distinction is real or the widespread species represent cryptic species complexes remains to be confirmed. Species In 2016, 50 species were known in the genus.

Regulus agreed to accompany the consuls of 216 BC, Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, along with the other surviving former consul of 217 BC, Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, when an army of 80,000 Romans and allies was amassed together to smash the Carthaginian army under Hannibal. The historian Polybius records that both he and Servilius died fighting bravely at the Battle of Cannae. However, there was a Marcus Atilius Regulus who was Praetor Urbanus (and later also Peregrinus), but it is thought that this person is actually a textual mis-reading of the name Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. It is unlikely that the aged, former consul would become a Praetor again three years after Cannae. His younger brother Gaius was killed fighting the Gauls at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, while his father, Marcus Atilius Regulus, who was executed by Carthage, was a consul twice during the First Punic War.

In particular, the focus of the working group is long-term measurement on wide-area, global Internet. This group also collaborates with other working groups on measurement, and has been working on building a public traffic trace repository. Challenges include: * collecting packet traces from the WIDE backbone network (sampling method, automation, high-speed packet capturing) * creating a large set of publicly available traces by removing or scrambling sensitive information (development of tools and scrambling method) * development of tools to analyze and visualize packet traces Through these measurement activities, it intends to contribute to various aspects of Internet operations including stable operation of major internet infrastructures such as DNS and routing, design of flexible and efficient network topology, and deployment of IPv6. International collaboration with the following organizations: * CAIDA * University of Waikato * ICANN RSSAC * ISC OARC * USC/ISI * INRIA * CNRS * AI3 partners History Started : 2002/10/21 The MAWI Working Group Traffic Archive has trans-Pacific packet traces from 1999-2003, with each day's statistics giving the protocol breakdown and the ten biggest flows. Including outliers like June 18, 2000 , when 57% of the packets were from DNS traffic.

Its powerful abbots governed Tibet during the 13th and the 14th centuries under the overlordship of the Mongol Yuan dynasty after the downfall of the Tibetan Empire until they were eclipsed by the rise of the new Kagyu and Gelug schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Its Mongolian architecture is quite different from that of temples in Lhasa and Yarlung. The only surviving ancient building is the Lhakang Chempo or Sibgon Trulpa. Originally a cave in the mountainside, it was built in 1268 by dpon-chen Sakya Sangpo in 1268 and restored in the 16th century.

RBI is a decision-making methodology for optimizing inspection plans. The RBI concept lies in that the risk of failure can be assessed in relation to a level that is acceptable, and inspection and repair used to ensure that the level of risk is below that acceptance limit. It examines the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and business risk of ‚Äòactive‚Äô and ‚Äòpotential‚Äô Damage Mechanisms (DMs) to assess and rank failure probability and consequence. This ranking is used to optimize inspection intervals based on site-acceptable risk levels and operating limits, while mitigating risks as appropriate. RBI analysis can be qualitative, quantitative or semi-quantitative in nature. Probability of Failure (PoF) is estimated on the basis of the types of degradation mechanisms operating in the component. It is calculated as the area of overlap between the distributions of the degradation rate for each degradation mechanism (based on uncertainties in rate) with the distribution of the resistance of the component to failure. Consequence of Failure (CoF) is defined for all consequences that are of importance , such as safety, economy and environment. Consequence of failure is evaluated as the outcome of a failure based on the assumption that such a failure will occur. Accuracy is a function of analysis methodology, data quality and consistency of execution. Precision is a function of the selected metrics and computational methods. Risk presented as a single numeric value (as in a quantitative analysis) does not guarantee greater accuracy compared to a risk matrix (as in a qualitative analysis), because of uncertainty that is inherent with probabilities and consequences. RBI is most often used in engineering industries and is predominant in the oil and gas industry. Assessed risk levels are used to develop a prioritized inspection plan. It is related to (or sometimes a part of) Risk Based Asset Management (RBAM), Risk Based Integrity Management (RBIM) and Risk Based Management (RBM). Generally, RBI is part of Risk and Reliability Management (RRM). The basis of most RBI programs is the Corrosion Circuit, in which each circuit can be compared for relative risk levels to aid in inspection and maintenance planning. Inspections typically employ non-destructive testing (NDT).  Prioritization  Items with high probability and high consequence (i.e. high risk) are given a higher priority for inspection than items that are high probability but for which failure has low consequences. This strategy allows for a rational investment of inspection resources.  Objectives  RBI assists a company to select cost effective and appropriate maintenance and inspection tasks and techniques, to minimize efforts and cost, to shift from a reactive to a proactive maintenance regime, to produce an auditable system, to give an agreed ‚Äúoperating window‚Äù, and to implement a risk management tool. The purposes of RBI include: # To improve risk management results # To provide a holistic, interdependent approach for managing risks # To apply a strategy of doing what is needed for safeguarding integrity and improving reliability and availability of the asset by planning and executing those inspections that are needed # To reduce inspections and shutdowns and provide longer run length without compromising safety or reliability # To safeguard integrity # To reduce the risk of failures # To increase plant availability and reduce unplanned outages # To provide a flexible technique able to continuously improve and adopt to changing risks # To ensure inspection techniques and methods consider potential failure modes  Standards  International engineering standards and recommended practices outline requirements, methodologies and the implementation of RBI. * EN 16991: Risk-based inspection framework * API 580: Risk-Based Inspection - Recommended Practice (Third edition, February 2016) * API 581: Risk Based Inspection Methodology - Recommended Practice (Third edition, April 2016) * ASME PCC-3: Inspection Planning Using Risk-Based Methods * DNV-RP G101: Risk Based Inspection Of Offshore Topsides Static Mechanical Equipment * EEMUA 159: Chapter 17 - RBI methodology for aboveground storage tanks * EPRI TR-112657: Revised Risk- Informed Inservice Inspection Evaluation * NCHRP Report 782: Proposed Guideline for Reliability-Based Bridge Inspection Practices See also Reliability engineering * Piping corrosion circuit  References  (1) Chapter 008, Risk-Based Inspection Technique by Mohamed El-Reedy (Author) Publisher: Gulf Professional Publishing (17 July 2012) ASIN: B00DGSWO4S * (2) A.

The work is divided into six movements and uses Jozef Janowski's (1865‚Äì1935) Polish translation of the Marian hymn, Stabat Mater. Szymanowski's first composition on a liturgical text, Stabat Mater was written during his late period of 1922‚Äì1937, characterized by his use of Polish melodies and rhythms. Following a trip to Zakopane in 1922, Szymanowski wrote of Polish folk music: \\"[it] is enlivening by its proximity to Nature, by its force, by its directness of feeling, by its undisturbed racial purity.\\"Leon Pommers, \\"Polish Aspects of Karol Szymanowski's Style\\" (Masters thesis, Queens College of the City University of New York, 1968), 30 Szymanowski's pairing of Polish musical elements with a liturgical text in Stabat Mater is unique.

However, later that year thoughts on such a composition were revived when Warsaw industrialist Bronis≈Çaw Krystall commissioned Szymanowski for a work in memory of his late wife. In addition, circumstances in the composer's personal life also served as an inspiration for the work.Zielinski, 9. Upon the death of his niece, Alusia Bartoszewicz√≥wna, in January 1925, the composer spent time consoling his sister in her loss, subsequently choosing to set the Stabat Mater text, with its profound reflection on the \\"grieving mother.\\" External circumstances also served as motivation for the work, including financial need, although there is no evidence of the composer receiving compensation for this work.Belland, Douglas Keith.

Kornel Micha≈Çowski indicates the composer's initial attraction to the Polish translation was a result of its \\"unusually primitive, almost 'folk- like' simplicity and naivety.\\".Zielinski, 10. While the score includes Latin translations, the score notes that it should always be performed in Polish when performed in Poland. For a full English translation and commentary on the Polish text and translation, see: Belland, Douglas Keith. An examination of the Persichetti, Poulenc, and Szymanowski Stabat Mater settings with pertinent information on the text. Dissertation: University of Cincinnati, 1992.  Study of Early Music  Coinciding with his composition of Stabat Mater, was Szymanowski's study of early music ‚Äì encompassing \\"pre-Palestrinian\\" and Palestrinian periods, as well as a study of old-Polish religious music.Zielinski, 14. Devices used indicating this influence include: parallel movement between voices, modal pitch organization, and strongly patterned rhythms such as ostinati. Also incorporated into the work are melodic elements of two Polish Hymns: ≈öwiƒôty Bo≈ºe [Holy God] and Gorzkie ≈ºale [Bitter Sorrows]..\\"Zielinski, 15.  Nationalism and folk music  Influenced by composers such as Stravinsky and Bart√≥k, Szymanowski began to incorporate folk music into his composition during his Nationalist period of 1922‚Äì1937. In the years preceding the composition of the Stabat Mater, the composer kept a notebook of highlanders' melodies that he encountered in his visits to the Tatra Mountains, which were later incorporated into his compositions. For example, his use of the Podhalean mode, an ancient Polish folk mode characterized by its raised fourth scale degree (Lydian), can be seen in Stabat Mater.\\"Zielinski, 19.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Reynolds used the slogan from Winston's introduction in 1954 until 1972. It is one of the best-known American tobacco advertising campaigns. In 1999, Advertising Age included the \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\" jingle in its list of the 10 best radio and television jingles in the United States during the 20th century. Advertising agency William Esty Co. deliberately, and ungrammatically, used \\"like\\" rather than \\"as\\" in the slogan and jingle. Esty executives Wendell Adams and Arline Lunny were in charge of the overall campaign. Lunny produced and directed most of the campaign's content during its early years. Although Adams was a classically trained musician, Margaret Johnson (a singer, pianist, and model) ghost wrote the jingle; Johnson and her husband, Travis Johnson, recorded it with their group, the Song Spinners. The slogan has become a piece of Americana, even for those too young to remember the campaign when it occurred. The slogan was included in the 1988 edition of Simpson's Contemporary Quotations. In a departure for the time, the advertising campaign targeted distinct niche groups within the broader market of smokers, such as American Jews and African Americans. This color advertisement depicts a black man and woman with Winston cigarettes.  Beginnings  Future R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company president Bowman Gray Jr. was in charge of marketing Winstons, which were a new addition to the R.J. Reynolds line in 1954. Gray listened to advertising employees from the William Esty Co., and the slogan \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette ought to\\" was considered, then replaced by the more succinct \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.\\" The first print ad appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in September 1954, with an ad in Life following the next month.Examples of the \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\" marketing campaign, various magazines, 1955-1969. In 1955, Winston would take over as the sponsor of Walter Cronkite's news show, as well as Garry Moore's variety show; it was at this time that the first television advertisements aired.  Radio and television  Fred (right) and Wilma Flintstone (left). This particular still is from the end-of-show sponsor bumper that aired at the end of every episode while Winston was the show's primary sponsor, until the second season. In the radio and television advertisements, the slogan is presented in a singsong fashion with a noticeable two-beat clap near the end, so the jingle would sound like Win-ston tastes good like a (clap clap) cigarette should. The \\"clap\\" noise was sometimes substituted for actors in the commercials knocking twice against a truck carrying Winston cigarettes, or an actor flicking his lighter twice to the same conceit. Winston cigarettes were sponsors of such television series as The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones. The former series would show stars Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, and Nancy Kulp extolling the virtues of Winstons while smoking them and reciting the jingle. The latter series would later come under fire for advertising cigarettes on an animated series watched by many children, but Winston pulled their involvement with the series after the Pebbles Flintstone character was born in 1963.  Grammar controversy  During the campaign's long run in the media, many criticized the slogan as grammatically incorrect and that it should say, \\"Winston tastes good as a cigarette should.\\" Ogden Nash, in The New Yorker, published a poem that ran \\"Like goes Madison Avenue, like so goes the nation.\\" Walter Cronkite, then hosting The Morning Show, refused to say the line as written, and an announcer was used instead. Malcolm Gladwell, in The Tipping Point, says that this \\"ungrammatical and somehow provocative use of 'like' instead of 'as' created a minor sensation\\" in 1954 and implies that the phrase itself was responsible for vaulting the brand to second place in the U.S. market. Winston overtook Pall Mall cigarettes as the #1 cigarette in the United States in 1966, while the advertising campaign continued to make an impression on the mass media. In the fall of 1961, a small furor enveloped the literary and journalistic communities in the United States when Merriam-Webster published its Third New International Dictionary. In the dictionary, the editors refused to condemn the use of \\"like\\" as a conjunction, and cited \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\" as an example of popular colloquial use. After publication of Webster's Third, The New York Times called the edition \\"bolshevik,\\" and the Chicago Daily News wrote that the transgression signified \\"a general decay in values.\\" When the players in The Beverly Hillbillies spoke the line, they stretched the grammatical boundaries further: : Jed: Winston tastes good... : Granny: Like a cigarette had ought-a! In 1970 and 1971, Winston sought to revamp its image and chose to respond to many grammarians' qualms with the slogan, \\"What do you want, good grammar or good taste?\\" Mad magazine published a parody of this on the back cover of its January 1971 issue; set in a cemetery, it featured four tombstones with epitaphs written in the past tense (\\"Winston tasted good like a cigarette should've\\" \\"You mean 'as a cigarette should've'\\" \\"What did you want, good grammar or good taste?\\" \\"I wanted to live a lot longer than this!\\"). With the new slogan in wide use, \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\" was retired permanently in 1972. In 1981, actor James Garner claimed responsibility for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which casts doubt on Garner's claim.  Parodies  The jingle was often parodied. The first line was typically, Winston tastes bad like the one I just had. The second line was commonly some variation on No filter, no flavor, it tastes like toilet paper, or, No filter, no taste, just a fifty- cent waste.

It has been developed in the United States for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This group of tests relies on antibody conjugation reactions to form colored complexes in the presence of specific biological fluids. Most tests are also designed so that only specific human fluids will end in a positive result. To perform a test, the sample in question is mixed with a buffer specific to the RSID test. The sample is then deposited onto the sample window where it is pulled through the test and control regions by a paper wick via passive diffusion. The RSID unit is impregnated with fluid-specific antibodies conjugated to colored complexes that will re-dissolve and diffuse at this time. If the fluid in question is present in the questioned sample, antibodies at the test line will react to the colored antibody complexes and form a colored line. If no fluid is present, or if the sample is not human, this line will not appear. A line will form at the control region regardless of if the sample contains body fluid or not, as it acts as an internal control.\\"Rapid Stain Identification of Human Saliva (RSID -Saliva).\\" Independent Forensics, Nov. 2016, ifi- test.com/documents/short-incub-SALIVA-Universal-Buffer-11-2016.pdf\\"Rapid Stain Identification of Human Blood (RSID -Blood).\\" Independent Forensics, April 2016, ifi-test.com/documents/BLOOD-Universal-BufferSpinEze062816-.pdf.\\"Rapid Stain Identification of Urine (RSID -Urine).\\" Independent Forensics, Jan. 2018, ifi-test.com/documents/URINE-5-10%20tests-01-2018.pdf\\"Rapid Stain Identification of Human Semen (RSID -Semen).\\" Independent Forensics, Feb. 2016, ifi-test.com/documents/022416-short-incub-SEMEN-Univ-Buffer1.pdf Positive and negative controls are also performed alongside each test to confirm its reliability and functionality.

Rex's lead singer Marc Bolan. It was produced in Manchester by Granada Television for the ITV network. A second series was planned but Bolan died before it could be produced. Produced by Muriel Young and directed by Nicholas Ferguson, it ran for six weekly episodes in the autumn of 1977, before its host died in a car crash on 16 September that year. A pop music show with a very limited budget and markedly low production values, it gave Bolan a chance to showcase punk bands such as Generation X, the Jam, Radio Stars and Eddie and the Hot Rods. T. Rex lip synced at least three songs each week, with Bolan's guitar never appearing to be plugged in, a mixture of new versions of their old hits, and fresh tracks, while the guests were slotted in between. Not all were as notable as those listed above, though they also included Roger Taylor, drummer with the rock band Queen, in a rare solo TV appearance. They were also joined by a dance troupe called Heart Throb. The last episode featured Bolan duetting \\"Sleeping Next To You\\" with his friend David Bowie. Before the song had reached its end, Bolan tripped over a microphone cable and fell off the stage. Bowie is said to have called out \\"Could we have a wooden box for Marc [to stand on]?\\". Following the show Bolan and Bowie co-wrote and recorded a rough outline of a new song, 'Madman'. The new wave band Cuddly Toys found a bootleg tape and recorded it, which became a UK Indie Chart single and featured on their 'Guillotine Theatre' album. The final show was recorded on 7 September 1977, but not broadcast until after Bolan's funeral on 20 September 1977, which was also attended by David Bowie and Rod Stewart, among others. An edited highlights compilation featuring T. Rex performances only was released in the United Kingdom on DVD in 2005, while 2007 saw an uncut DVD release in Japan only.

History The group was founded on 26 April 1935 by 39 inmates. The group declared its adherence to the Communist Party of India. Its founders belonged to a minority tendency with the pro-Marxist section of the Anushilan Samiti. The majority of the nationwide Anushilan Marxist tendency however distrusted the Communist Party and did not join it. The group organised a May Day celebration in 1935. The group edited a hand-written magazine, The Call. Membership The membership of the organization expanded rapidly (different sources talk about 200-500 members). Its members included Shiv Verma (an associate of Bhagat Singh, later Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) leader in Uttar Pradesh), Hare Krishna Konar (later a founding leader of CPI(M)), Biplabi Dhrubesh Chattopadhyay (sentenced to seven years imprisonment in connection with the Dakhineswar Bomb Case), Sudhangshu Basgupta, Ananta Chakravorty (a Jugantar member, sentenced for the Conspiracy and Bomb Case), Nalini Das (a Jugantar member, sentenced for the Mechua Bazar Bomb Case), Fakir Sen and Jibendra Das (an Anushilan revolutionary from Tripura).

The district also serves a small portion of the nearby town of Kilgore. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  Overview  Located in western Gregg County, Sabine ISD has three schools - *Sabine High School (Grades 9-12) *Sabine Middle School (Grades 6-8) *Sabine Elementary School (Grades PK-5) For much of the 1980s and 90's Sabine ISD was split into four campuses, Elementary, Intermediate, Junior High and High School. It is not clear why the split, nor why the district reverted to three campuses during the late 1990s. The current high school was dedicated in 1984. The current junior high, previously the high school, was dedicated in 1969. The junior high campus was constructed after a fire destroyed the former high school. The elementary campus was built originally in the early 20th century with its primary school wing completed in 1980 and the former intermediate school campus completed in 1969 on the site of the former high school which had burned the same year. In December 2014, with a bond passed a year earlier, Sabine Elementary was dedicated at its new location, 645 Access Road Kilgore. It is the only campus within Sabine ISD that is located in Kilgore. Sabine's mascot is the Cardinal. The school's colors are royal blue and cardinal red. Historically the school has emphasized the blue in its uniforms. The band traditionally has worn red jackets over blue trouser's with white highlights on the jacket. The school's athletic program is best known for the success of its boys' and girls' basketball programs. The school won two boys' titles in the 1979‚Äì80 and 1980-81 seasons. The boys' team completed a perfect 34-0 season en route to their second title in 1981. A sign at the towns main intersection of Highway 3053 (Old Highway 135) and FM 1252 commemorates the program's two titles. The team made the 2009 and 2010 playoffs but were eliminated both times in the regional tournament. The girls team advanced as far as the Area Finals in 2009. Sabine gained statewide fame through its basketball program under the leadership of legendary Coach Carl Allen who guided the boys program for many years. Coach Allen retired in the late 1990s with over 700 career wins and two state titles. Allen died in October 2011. Allen, a graduate of East Texas Baptist University in nearby Marshall, TX, remains one of the winningest basketball coaches in Texas high school history. The school district was founded in 1893. In 1965 the district voted to integrate and integration was completed in 1969. The former all black school known as North Chapel was closed after integration was completed. This was completed during the period of the school's greatest athletic success on the gridiron. Since the early 1980s the school's football program has seen little success. The Cardinals last made the playoffs in 1985 under coach Barry Morgan when the team finished the regular season 8-2. The team had no wins in the 2008 and 2011 seasons. The school is served by the Gladewater Post Office and therefore the school is often formally referred to as Gladewater-Sabine. However, this should not be confused with the Gladewater ISD which is located nearby across the mighty Sabine River. Sabine is an independent school district and has been since 1951. The name Sabine was chosen based on a former name for the community in which it is located. Other early names for the community were Goforth and Hogeye, and Reject. Sabine was eventually chosen as the name for the community's first post office.

It was adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The film stars Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Reeve, Madeleine Potter, and Jessica Tandy. The movie received respectable reviews and showings at arthouse theaters in New York, London and other cities. The film received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Redgrave's performance and its costume design. Plot The film is set among the Back Bay uppercrust of the 19th century. Basil Ransom (Christopher Reeve), bored by his opulent lifestyle and his \\"proper\\" friends, is fascinated by his cousin, outspoken suffragette Olive Chancellor (Vanessa Redgrave). Basil and Olive's mutual friend is likeable, gregarious Verena Tannant (Madeleine Potter). Soon a triangle develops, albeit an unorthodox one: Basil and Olive both find themselves pursuing Verena, Basil because he is in love with her, and Olive because she wants to exploit Verena's social connections (although some have thought she was also a lesbian, but did not know for certain) and use Verena's gift for public speaking to promote her own political ideology. Lurking in the background is Verena's true love, poor-but-honest attorney Henry Burrage (John Van Ness Philip).

Biography Lee was born in Whitechapel, London. His father was a singer. He learned the rudiments of the piano from his elder brother, Arthur, who was self-taught and preferred to use the black keys rather than the white.Tony Lee Obituary Henrybebop.co.uk As a consequence, he became fluent in keys such as G flat and B natural, before moving on to more standard keys, leaving him with the ability to transpose effortlessly his entire repertoire into any key. He played as a regular for many years with a trio comprising bassist Tony Archer and drummer Martin Drew or Terry Jenkins at The Bull's Head in Barnes, London, a few miles from his home in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. During a visit by the former Count Basie tenor-saxophonist Billy Mitchell who came to play at the Bull's Head, both Mitchell and Lee got on so well together that the Bull's Dan Fleming organised for both of them to tour in the US in 1984. Fleming said at the time, \\"Lee could bring out the best in everybody and he drew you into the music.\\" Despite his sketchy knowledge of musical theory, he was a complete master of his instrument, and blessed with large hands, (he could stretch an 11th with ease), his solos ranged from effortless large block chords to delicate single note figures, all played in a lyrical style, and swinging like a garden gate. He was arguably the greatest British exponent of the Erroll Garner piano style, though his playing embraced a much wider compass. He appeared on at least two recordings with Seamen - Phil Seamen Now! . . . Live! (1968) and on Phil Seamen Meets Eddie Gomez (1968), a live recording featuring US bassist Eddie G√≥mez. His solo debut, Electric Piano (1971), earned many comparisons to the works of Burt Bacharach. He made at least four other LPs, including Tony Lee Trio (British Jazz Artists Vol. 1), probably the quintessential album of his career (1976), Street of Dreams (1979), Hey There (1992) and The Tony Lee Trio Live at the Station (2002), prior to his death from cancer in 2004. He had a long-lasting association of some 40 years with bassist Tony Archer in the Tony Lee Trio. Lee and Archer also played together in the sextet The Best of British Jazz formed in the early 1970s with Jack Parnell (drums), Kenny Baker (trumpet), Don Lusher (trombone) and Betty Smith (tenor sax). The sextet recorded two albums - The Best of British Jazz and The Very Best of British Jazz. As with many pianists from the 1950s and 1960s Lee was influenced by Errol Garner, Oscar Peterson and Art Tatum. Personal life and death Lee died on 2 March, 2004 in Esher, Surrey. He is survived by his wife Olga and one stepson.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The museum is housed in an 1830 brick-built pumping station which was the first of several similar pumping stations to be built on the Somerset Levels which are prone to flooding. The main attraction is the 1861 Easton and Amos steam engine and pump, the only one still in its original location and in working order. The museum, which is run by a charity, also restores and displays a number of other steam engines and pumps. The steam for the moving exhibits is provided by a Marshall portable boiler. The Westonzoyland Light Railway, a short narrow-gauge railway runs the length of the site and is used to carry wood for the boiler. History The Somerset Moors and Levels, formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape, consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level, with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it. Early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the Romans (although records only date from the 13th century), but were not widespread. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way. In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage. Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around 1129. In 1234, were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and, from the accounts in Glastonbury Abbey's rent books, this had increased to by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. They included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. The light rail track leading to the pump house, with the forge to the right In 1500, there was of floodable land of which only had been reclaimed. In 1597, of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later, near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; and three further reclamations, totalling , had been undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660. In the early 17th century, during the time of King James I, abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor, which the local Lords supported but opposed by the Commoners who would have lost grazing rights. In 1632, Charles I sold the Crown's interest in the scheme, and it was taken over by a consortium that included Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch drainage engineer. However, the work was delayed by the English Civil War and later defeated in Parliament after local opposition. In 1638, it was reported that nearly of Tealham and Tadham Moors were not reclaimed, with a total of being undrained. Between 1785 and 1791, much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed. In 1795, John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes (a local name for drainage channels, pronounced \\"reens\\" in the east and rhyne to the west) between plots, and wrote in his Agriculture of the County of Somerset that had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare, at Nyland, at Blackford, at Mark, in Shapwick and at Westhay. Little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, possibly because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as they were on the Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon at the mouth of the River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The 1861 Easton and Amos engine The first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels was built in 1830 to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery. The success of the drainage system led to the formation of other drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations. The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel (like a water wheel running backwards) but, after 25 years, there were problems pumping the water away because the land had dropped as it dried out despite the wheel being raised in 1843. A better method was sought, and in 1861 the present Easton and Amos pump was installed. The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne (pronounced 'reen') into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, by which time the local drainage system had been linked into King's Sedgemoor Drain, which discharged further down the River Parrett; the water levels dropped and the pump was unable to draw the water from the rhyne. Additionally, the Parrett riverbank has now been raised by some in the vicinity of the pumping station and the opening to the river, from the base of the pump-well, is now bricked up. In 1951 a diesel pump, with a capacity of 50 tons per minute, was installed by the Environment Agency in an adjacent building meaning that the steam pump was no longer needed. The station itself is a Flemish bond brick-built property with a slate hipped roof and chimney rising to in height. A cottage section was added alongside it in the 1860s, to provide accommodation for the station-keeper. Originally given a Grade II listing, the property was upgraded to Grade II* by English Heritage since it is now the only surviving station that still houses a functioning engine. Beside the cottage is a long single-storey building that houses a 1914 Lancashire boiler; this was used to provide steam. Next to it is a forge, where the keeper would have made a number of his own tools. The boiler required constant running and thus consumed a good deal of coal. =Restoration= The Wills brickworks engine In 1976, members of the Somerset Industrial Archaeology Society began restoration of the site. The Westonzoyland Engine Trust achieved charitable status in 1980 and in 1990 bought the site from the owners, Wessex Water. The structure of the engine house has been stabilised and the pump house and chimney rebuilt. A new exhibition hall has also been built. Up until early 2010, the keeper's cottage had been off-limits to visitors. Two of the ground-floor rooms have now been opened: the living-room is furnished in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of display cases, with a view to showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. The upper floors remain closed to visitors. Museum The Marshall boiler At the western end of the site is the pump house. It houses the 1861 engine which was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a twin-cylinder, vertical condensing engine, driving a centrifugal pump developed by John Appold. A similar engine was on display at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100 tons of water per minute, to a height of . The engine was originally powered by Cornish boilers, but these were replaced in with 1914 Lancashire boiler, with two fire tubes, made by Fred Danks. The boiler is beyond economic restoration. In addition to the Easton and Amos pump, a collection of steam and diesel engines with connections either to the area or to pumping have been assembled on site and regular steam days are held. The oldest item dates from the early 19th century, through to several Victorian engines and onward to the 20th century. These are housed in several different buildings and areas: the exhibition hall, the courtyard, the \\"wiggly shed\\", the pump room and the engine house itself. Most of the machines are in running order, although some are still awaiting restoration. Steam is provided by an elderly Marshall portable boiler ‚Äì essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being passed on to the Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump. The light railway, inclined plane and exhibition hall, with the pump house and chimney in the distance. Engines by a range of other manufacturers are on display. These include 'quick revolution' engines by Belliss and Morcom, Robey & Co., Easton and Johnson and Sissons. There are horizontal engines by W. and F. Wills and by J. Culverwell, of Bridgwater. The Culverwell machine is a horizontal single cylinder steam engine originally used in Holt's Brewery at Burnham-on-Sea, while the Wills engine was used in a brickworks. Additional exhibits include two small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, and a small 'Wessex' steam turbine milk bottle washer. A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater. Westonzoyland Light Railway is a short narrow-gauge railway running alongside the pumping station. It was constructed after the closure of the pumping station to move heavy machinery around the site and is used to transport timber from the wood pile to the boiler. The engines used are a Simplex diesel locomotive, built in 1968, which was previously at the Minworth Sewage Treatment Works in Sutton Coldfield and a 1949 Lister rail-truck previously used by the Eclipse Peat Company at Ashcott. A steam winch built by John Lynch of Sunderland is used to move one of the trucks up an inclined plane to demonstrate how this would have been done in goods yards and docks.

The island is situated approximately south southeast of South East Cape and is contained within the Southwest National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site. An erosional remnant of the Tasmanian mainland, the island is approximately long, wide, with an elevation of above sea level. The island is estimated to have separated from the Tasmanian mainland at least 15,000 years ago. Features and location Pedra Branca is known for its inaccessibility, rich marine wildlife, wet and windy weather, interesting geology and large waves. With an area of , the island is small enough to provide an example of an outcrop that lies on the border between being a rock or islet and an island. The geology features three breccia cones of dolerite and sandstone. =Flora and fauna= The only plant species found on the island is the succulent Sarcocornia quinqueflora. Recorded breeding seabird species include fairy prion, Pacific gull, silver gull, kelp gull, black-faced cormorant, Australasian gannet, and shy albatross. Australian fur seals use the island as a regular haul-out site while New Zealand fur seals visit occasionally. Remarkably, the tiny, windswept island is the only known habitat of a species of lizard, the Pedra Branca skink, Niveoscincus palfreymani. An estimated 400 individuals survive, but the species is listed as vulnerable. Important Bird Area Together with the nearby Eddystone and Sidmouth Rock the island constitutes the Pedra Branca Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports over 1% of the world populations of shy albatrosses and Australasian gannets. History Abel Tasman led the first known European expedition to sight Tasmania. His journal entry for 29 November 1642 records that he observed a rock which was similar to a rock named Pedra Branca off China, presumably referring to the Pedra Branca in the South China Sea. The journal places Pedra Branca \\"about four [Dutch] miles\\" from the mainland of Tasmania; a Dutch mile from this period was about , thus 4 such Dutch miles would be , which is close to the actual distance of Pedra Branca from South East Cape. =Shipwreck= On 7 February 1973 Nisshin Maru No. 8, a Japanese steel fishing vessel of led by Captain Nakayama, on its way to Hobart for a mechanical inspection, hit Pedra Branca and sank in deep water within a few minutes. In the ensuing confusion only one of the crew of 22, engineer Yoshiichi Meguro, managed to clamber onto the rocks and escape drowning. The fishing vessel Walrus rescued the survivor. The Nisshin Maru No. 8 disaster led to considerable improvements in communications between the various authorities that should have been able to mount a rescue operation many hours before this one was commenced. These included direct links between Japanese fishing boats and Australian shore stations, and correcting the inability of fishing vessels to directly contact warships and military aircraft, as they were unable to contact the Hobart emergency radio station which did not operate at night. Weather Weather conditions in the area can be extreme, and Pedra Branca is occasionally swept by freak waves. On 15 April 2003, oceanographer Hamish Saunders drowned after being washed off Pedra Branca. The Tasmanian Coroner's report includes testimony from three witnesses who described how Saunders was swept away when a \\"wave hit the island resulting in heavy spray coming up to and over the level\\". Waves were measured that day at up to by the Cape Sorell Waverider Buoy, some away. Etymology Pedra Branca is Portuguese for \\"white rock\\". According to historian Kenneth McIntyre, Pedra Branca is one of only two Australian places with a name of Portuguese origin, the other being the Houtman Abrolhos islands in Western Australia. Surfing Pedra Branca is home to a big wave surf break at a reef approximately 40 km offshore. Marty Paradisis was the first person to surf it. later, In 2008 Ross Clarke-Jones and Tom Carroll joined local surfers Marti Paradisis and brothers James and Tyler Hollmer-Cross to shoot a story about it which was featured on 60 Minutes. On 1 January 2016, a picture of Pedra Branca with seals and birds chasing fish, was the worldwide feature photograph for National Geographic. The picture was taken in late 2015 by Andy Chisholm who was among a group of surfers who had gone to surf and photograph the big waves. Another surfer, James Hollmer-Cross, was wiped out by a wave, broke his leg in two places, perforated an ear drum, tore a knee ligament and suffered a compression fracture in his shin bone.Pedra Branca feeding frenzy puts Tasmanian photographer Andy Chisholm in global spotlight, ABC News Online, 5 January 2015 See also List of islands of Tasmania References Category:South West Tasmania Category:Protected areas of Tasmania Category:Southern Tasmania Category:Important Bird Areas of Tasmania Category:Islands of South West Tasmania Category:Maritime history of the Dutch East India Company ","title":"Pedra Branca (Tasmania)"},{"id":"5986249","text":"Plaster's Green Meadows () is a 4.3 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest near the village of Nempnett Thrubwell, Bath and North East Somerset, notified in 1989. This is an area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog‚Äôs-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog‚Äôs-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer‚Äôs Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper- saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil‚Äôs-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady‚Äôs Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre).

In the 1930s and 1940s, a rebuilt Beomeosa temple became center for the monks' underground resistance to Japanese occupation.Fighting Monks' new master shares martial arts style with the world LA Times, 26/Dec/2011 However, the martial art of Sunmudo had been neglected since the 19th century. At Beomeosa temple located in Busan, Monk Yang-ik revived the art by systematizing the techniques. Monk Jeogun worked on its popularization during the 1970s. These days training is offered to non-Buddhists and laypersons at Golgulsa temple in Korea, and other places around the world as well.

Its sound is a major departure from his debut record, Song Cycle (1967), featuring all cover versions of previously written songs. The album mostly features songs popularized by early Calypso musicians, as well as songs by Allen Toussaint (\\"Occapella\\" and \\"Riverboat\\"), Little Feat (\\"Sailin' Shoes\\"), John Philip Sousa (\\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\") and one song of unknown origin (\\"Be Careful\\"). The title of the album is derived from the poem \\"I Am Waiting\\" by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Background Most of the album's songs were originally written by early Calypso musicians between the 1920s and 1940s, but had fallen into the public domain by the time Discover America was recorded in 1972. As such, nearly all of the songs are listed as \\"Public domain; arranged & adapted by Van Dyke Parks.\\" Lyrical themes run a wide range of American history, from John Paul Jones, to early 20th-century musicians Bing Crosby and The Mills Brothers, actor Jack Palance, and political figures Franklin Roosevelt and J. Edgar Hoover. Parks would continue his study of Calypso and Caribbean music on his third album, Clang of the Yankee Reaper, released in 1975. Throughout the 1970s, Parks acted as producer on Calypso albums for other artists, including The Esso Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band's Esso in 1971, and The Mighty Sparrow's 1974 album, Hot and Sweet. Song information The first track on Discover America, \\"Jack Palance\\", is a one-minute clip of The Mighty Sparrow's actual version of the song. Parks did not cover any Mighty Sparrow songs on the album, but would later produce Sparrow's 1974 Warner Bros. release, Hot and Sweet; Parks would later re- release Hot and Sweet on his own record label, Bananastan in 2011. \\"Introduction\\" is credited to Samuel Alter, and features an unknown man (likely either Alter or Parks) speaking into a tape recorder about Parnassus, Pennsylvania, Mount Olympus, and Daylight Saving Time.AllMusic review: \\"Discover America.\\" The third track is Parks' cover of \\"Bing Crosby\\", written by Roaring Lion. \\"Steelband Music\\" prominently features The Esso Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band on vocals and steel drums; \\"Steelband Music\\"'s original writer is unknown, and it may be a traditional Calypso song.AllMusic review: \\"Steelband Music.\\" \\"The Four Mills Brothers\\" was written by The Lion (also known as Roaring Lion), and it speaks about the history and fame of jazz vocal group The Mills Brothers. The song's chorus is lifted from that of 1915 song \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\", a song covered in the 1930s by The Mills Brothers. \\"Be Careful\\" has been described by AllMusic as \\"a piece of advice from a father to a son when the offspring is approaching the age when love is being considered. A brilliant, almost chamber string arrangement carries the overall melody, yet this is combined with the Trinidad steel band music that Van Dyke Parks was fully and happily involved in at the time.\\"AllMusic review: \\"Be Careful.\\" AllMusic credits the song to Leo Robin, but this is an error. The author is currently unknown. \\"John Jones\\" was performed by Trojan Records artist Rudy Mills in the late 1960s. \\"FDR in Trinidad\\" was written by Attila the Hun, and speaks about United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 visit to Trinidad.AllMusic review: \\"FDR in Trinidad.\\" \\"FDR in Trinidad\\" also features performances by members of the band Little Feat. A Rykodisc version of Discover America contains a bonus track, a cover of Joseph Spence's \\"Out on the Rolling Sea (Where Jesus Speaks to Me)\\". Influence Many songs on the album have been sampled during live shows by the Australian plunderphonics artists The Avalanches. Even citing Van Dyke Parks as an inspiration for both of their albums.

Copyrights and legalities Nearly all tracks on Discover America are listed on the album sleeve as being \\"Public domain, arranged & adapted by Van Dyke Parks\\". However, many of the songs' original artists were still alive in 1972, but were not given writing credits on the album. At the time, The United States' Copyright Act of 1909 allowed for a copyright term of 28 years, followed by an optional one-time renewal for a second 28-year term. As such, the longest copyright allowed was 56 years from the original creation date. The Copyright Act of 1976, signed into law only four years after Discover America was recorded, greatly changed copyright laws in the US, extending the copyright of the artist to either 75 years or the life of the author plus an additional 50 years.

He was a part-time driver on the Busch Series from 1997‚Äì1999. Before competing in the Busch Series, Foster was an avid competitor at Florida tracks, winning more than 200 races by the age of 15. He then competed in the NASCAR Goody's Dash Series in 1996, winning once and clinching the series' Rookie of the Year award while finishing 7th in series points. His season got off to a wild start at Daytona though; while running 2nd, a tire blew on his car, sending him spinning before his car went airborne on the tri-oval for several feet before landing back on the track. He walked away okay, but the accident marked the last straw by Goody's Dash officials regarding airborne crashes as they mandated the roof flaps on all the cars, just like in NASCAR's top tier series, starting the next year in 1997, however airborne crashes and flips were still very common throughout the rest of the series' existence. Foster made his Busch series debut the next year in 1997, running the #11 Key Motorsports Chevy at Rockingham. He started 36th and only managed to finish 35th. However, he was able to complete the race. Foster gradually improved as he would end up making ten starts in all in the season. His best run was a 16th at New Hampshire International Speedway and started 13th at Charlotte. However, inconsistently weighed the team down and Foster was ultimately released. He did not finish in five of ten starts and managed only 51st in points. He did not race further in the season. Foster ran five races in 1998, all for Washington-Erving Motorsports. He struggled in his starts, only finishing one race. That race, at Nashville, was his best finish of the year with a 25th. Foster's qualifying was significantly improved, however. He started 11th at Bristol and 9th at Texas, his first career top-10 start. However, the poor results led to Foster's unemployment once again. Foster then had another wild accident to begin his 1999 season. During his brief comeback to the Goody's Dash series in the Discount Auto Parts 200 at Daytona, Foster went on his side after making contact in a three wide situation with Derrick Kelly and Scott Krehling in a big accident that also saw Brent Moore go upside down on the backstretch for several feet. Once again, he emerged from the wreck without injury. That wreck was one of many big accidents in a race won by Christian Elder, in which another massive accident occurred on the tri-oval on lap 11 involving injuries between Scott Weaver and George Crenshaw, but both were overshadowed by the biggest accident of the race with 6 to go when Danny Bagwell went for a horrific barrel roll in between the exit of turn 4 and the tri-oval in what many call the worst accident in Goody's Dash series history. Bagwell was also okay. Later that year, Foster ran his final career Busch series race, driving for Blaise Alexander's #20 at Myrtle Beach Speedway. He started the race in 15th, but once again could not finish the race. He was 34th after overheating and it would prove to be the end of Foster's NASCAR career.

In 1262 William Boscher had held land in Bashley from Christchurch Manor, and in 1315 Robert Boscher died possessed of Bashley Manor. The priory still owned part of the original estate in 1384, when it received a grant of free warren there. This land seems to have been absorbed into their manor of Somerford; it is included in an account of the manor in 1628, and sixty years later there is mention of a copse at Bashley belonging to the manor. Bashley Common was inclosed in 1817. Ossemsley Manor changed hands a few times during the 19th century before being rebuilt in 1908 for Sir Alfred Cooper (1846-1915).

He was a prolific portrait painter, renowned for his commissioned portraits of London's high society and British aristocracy, notable portraits include Robert Baden-Powell (1929), Queen Mary (1930 and 1932), King George VI (1937), Winston Churchill (1939), Vivien Leigh (1941) and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1958).  Personal life  David Jagger was born in Kilnhurst, near Rotherham, in 1891. He was the son of colliery manager Enoch Jagger and his wife Mary Sargeant. He had two older siblings, a sister Edith (1881‚Äì1977) and brother Charles (1885‚Äì1934). Edith became a painter of still lives, and co-founded the charitable organisation, Painted Fabrics Ltd in 1917 and Charles became a celebrated sculptor. David Jagger studied at the Sheffield School of Art, briefly studying at the same time with both his elder sister and brother. An accomplished draughtsman and skilled illustrator he became a medal-winning student in mural design and painting. After his art education finished, he moved to London. Initially he obtained employment in a commercial art studio and produced portraits in the evening. He became a leading exhibitor with several societies including the Royal Institute of Oil Painters (R.O.I.) and Royal Society of Portrait Painters (R.P.). He regularly exhibited at the Summer Exhibition at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists (R.B.A.). His paintings brought him both critical and commercial success, which enabled him to set up his own professional portrait studio in Chelsea, south-west London. After the Great War finished, he met and fell in love with Katherine Gardiner, she immediately became his muse and features in many key work from the period. The couple married in 1921. Throughout the 1930s his austere and highly finished portraits were in great demanded by London's elite, for which there was often a waiting list. A major solo exhibition David Jagger was held at the J. Leger Galleries in London (1935). The display was an informal retrospective and featured sixty-six paintings. The exhibition received glowing reviews and was extended due to popular demand. In 1939, he arranged and promoted a touring exhibition, The Art of the Jagger Family, which included work by all three Jagger siblings.  Key Works  thumb Jagger's most reproduced work is the portrait of Robert Baden-Powell, as presented to Lord Baden-Powell during the Coming of Age Jamboree on 10 August 1929. Innumerable copies of this portrait have been created, and are displayed on Scouting premises worldwide. The original is on display at Baden- Powell House London, the former headquarters of The Scout Association. A reproduction is in the Office of the Secretary General of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in Geneva, Switzerland. Jagger produced portraits of many successful and illustrious people, many of the most successful were first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London between 1917 and 1958. Other interesting early works include the artist Robert Fowler (1916), physician Dr. Thomas Forrest Cotton (1926), and Sheffield benefactor and business man J.G. Graves (1920). He produced eighteen military portraits, including an intimate study of his brother, Charles Sargeant Jagger (1917) entitled 'Portrait of an Army Officer'. He also painted many anonymous sitters, such as Portrait of an Officer of the RAF (1941), The Silk Scarf (1926), Negro Profile (1935), and Olga (1936). His most successful works were portraits of women, ranging from Lady Millicent Taylour (1918) through to Mrs Thelma Bader, wife of Wing Commander Douglas Bader (1942). His final decade was filled with predominately male commissioned portraits, culminating in his final canvas, an unfinished portrait of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1958) Throughout his career Jagger also painted landscapes for his own amusement, most of which were never exhibited. He produced landscape paintings in Ireland, France, Spain and Italy. Closer to home, his favoured views were picturesque scenes in Derbyshire, Dorset and Sussex.  Reassessment  As a principal portraitist working in London during the inter-war years Jagger's work has undergone a reappraisal in recent years. This ongoing re-evaluation of contemporary British artists working in the first half of the twentieth century has led to several notable canvases by David Jagger appearing at auction in London. David Jagger's life and work is the subject of a forthcoming publication, 'The Art of the Jagger Family' by Timothy Dickson and a separate catalogue raisonn√® is also in preparation (Winter 2017).Official website  See also  Baden-Powell House * Don Potter *Yorkshire Art Journal David Jagger, York, 2014 - Historical Feature  References  Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:1891 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Kilnhurst Category:Alumni of Sheffield Hallam University Category:English portrait painters ","title":"David Jagger"},{"id":"5986359","text":"Shannon Brown may refer to: * Shannon Brown, American basketball player * Shannon Brown (musician), American country music artist * Shannon Brown (New Zealand musician), bass player and vocalist for the New Zealand band 48May ","title":"Shannon Brown (disambiguation)"},{"id":"5986363","text":"Spring Hill Independent School District is a public school district based in Longview, Texas (USA).

It consists of two segments, the first as a connected conflict of the Thirty Years War, ended by the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the second continuing until the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees. The war is generally viewed by historians as inconclusive. Major areas of conflict included Northern Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, Catalonia, and the Rhineland. In addition, Spain backed the 1648 to 1653 French civil war known as the Fronde, while France supported revolts against Spanish rule in Portugal, Catalonia and Naples. Their contest for influence included taking opposing sides in unrelated conflicts like the 1639 to 1642 Piedmontese Civil War. France avoided direct confrontation with the Habsburgs until May 1635, when it declared war on Spain, and entered the Thirty Years War through alliances with Sweden and the Dutch Republic. After Westphalia in 1648, the Dutch and Emperor Ferdinand left the war, leaving only Spain and France. The outbreak of the Fronde, combined with the neutrality of the powerful Dutch navy, allowed Spain to regain some of its losses between 1650 and 1652, but the war quickly became a stalemate. In 1657, France allied with the English Commonwealth, which had been at war with Spain since December 1654. An Anglo- French land and sea offensive in Flanders led to victory at the Battle of the Dunes in June 1658, and the capture of Dunkirk. While Spain remained strong enough to prevent France from fully exploiting this success, attacks by the English navy had severely damaged their economy; both sides were financially exhausted and made peace in November 1659. Although relatively minor, French territorial gains strengthened its borders, while Louis XIV of France married Maria Theresa of Spain, eldest daughter of Philip IV. Spain remained a vast global empire, but the war is seen as marking the loss of its position as the dominant European state, and the rise of France. Strategic overview France expansion, 1552 to 1798 17th century Europe was dominated by the struggle between the Bourbon kings of France, and their Habsburg rivals in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Until the mid 20th century, the Thirty Years War was primarily seen as a German religious conflict; in 1938, historian CV Wedgwood argued it formed part of a wider, ongoing European struggle, with the Habsburg-Bourbon conflict at its centre. Modern historians sometimes refer to the Franco-Spanish War as a 'declared war', which represents only one phase of an ongoing contest, with many different locations and participants. During the 1620s, France was threatened internally by a series of Huguenot rebellions, and externally by Habsburg possessions on their borders in the Spanish Netherlands, Franche-Comt√©, Alsace, Roussillon and Lorraine (see Map). Prior to 1635, they indirectly sought to weaken both branches of the Habsburgs wherever possible by financing their opponents, including the Dutch, clients in Northern Italy and the Grisons, the Ottomans, the Venetian Republic, Transylvania, and Sweden. After 1635, this changed to direct intervention through anti-Habsburg alliances with the Dutch and Swedish, while supporting insurgents in Portugal, Catalonia and Naples For their part, the Habsburgs provided support for the Huguenots, and numerous conspiracies led by the feudal lords who resented their loss of power under Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin. The most significant included the 1632 Montmorency plot, the 1641 Princes des Paix rising, and Cinq-Mars in 1642. Spain also financed the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the Fronde. Wider co-operation between the Habsburgs was limited, since their objectives did not always align; Spain was a global maritime power, Austria primarily a European land power, focused on the Empire, which contained over 1,800 members, most extremely small. Although a Habsburg had been Holy Roman Emperor since 1440, their control over the Empire was weakened by the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, and this continued in the period leading up to 1620. Reversing this was a key factor behind Austrian involvement in the Thirty Years War; the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia accepted this had failed. France faced the same issue of diverging objectives with its allies. The war coincided with the period of economic supremacy known as the Dutch Golden Age, and by 1640, many Dutch statesmen viewed French ambitions in the Spanish Netherlands as a threat. Unlike France, Swedish war aims were restricted to Germany, and in 1641, they considered a separate peace with Ferdinand. Much of the fighting took place around the Spanish Road, an overland supply route connecting Spanish possessions in Northern Italy to Flanders. Rarely used for moving soldiers post-1601, it remained vital for trade, and went through areas like Alsace essential to French security. In Northern Italy, Savoy and the Spanish-held Duchy of Milan were strategically important, since they provided access to the vulnerable southern borders of France, and Habsburg territories in Austria. Richelieu aimed to end Spanish dominance in these areas, an objective largely achieved by the time he died in 1642. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, water was the primary means of bulk transportation, and campaigns focused on control of rivers and ports. Armies relied on foraging, while feeding the draught animals essential for transport and cavalry restricted campaigning in the winter. By the 1630s, the countryside had been devastated by years of constant warfare, which limited the size of armies, and the ability to conduct operations. Sickness killed far more soldiers than battle; The French army of 27,000 that invaded Flanders in May 1635 was reduced by desertion and disease to under 17,000 by early July. Background Philip IV of Spain, ruler from 1621 to 1665 The Thirty Years War began in 1618 when the Protestant-dominated Bohemian Estates offered the Crown of Bohemia to Frederick of the Palatinate, rather than the conservative Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II. Most of the Holy Roman Empire remained neutral, viewing it as an inheritance dispute, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. However, when Frederick refused to admit defeat, Imperial forces invaded the Palatinate and forced him into exile; removal of a hereditary prince changed the nature and extent of the war. Accompanied by a renewed Counter-Reformation, this threatened Protestant states within the Empire. It also drew in external powers who held Imperial territories; Nassau- Dillenburg was a hereditary possession of the Dutch Prince of Orange, while Christian IV of Denmark was also Duke of Holstein. With France facing Spanish- financed Huguenot rebellions from 1622 to 1630, and proxy wars in Italy from 1628 to 1631, this provided opportunities to weaken the Habsburgs, but avoid direct conflict. France supported the Dutch Republic in their war with Spain, as well as funding first Danish, then Swedish intervention in the Empire. In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Pomerania; partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, he also sought control of the Baltic trade, which provided much of Sweden's income. These economic drivers meant Swedish intervention continued after his death in 1632, but led to conflict with Saxony, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark-Norway. Defeat at N√∂rdlingen in September 1634 forced the Swedes to retreat, while most of their German allies made peace with Ferdinand in the 1635 Treaty of Prague. Louis XIII, French ruler from 1610 to 1643 The other major European conflict of the period was the 1568 to 1648 Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch Republic, suspended in 1609 by the Twelve Years' Truce. The Spanish strongly objected to its commercial provisions and when Philip IV became king in 1621, he resumed the war. The cost proved extremely high, increased after 1628 by a proxy war with France over the Mantuan succession. While the Spanish Empire reached its maximum extent under Philip's rule, its complexity and size made it increasingly difficult to govern, or enact essential reforms. In 1628, the Dutch captured the Spanish treasure fleet, which they used to finance the 1629 capture of 's-Hertogenbosch. The powerful Amsterdam mercantile lobby saw this as an opportunity to end the war; negotiations ended without result in 1633, but strengthened the peace party. The Peace of Prague led to rumours of a proposed Austro-Spanish offensive in the Netherlands, leading Louis XIII and Richelieu to decide on direct intervention. In early 1635, they signed an agreement with Bernard of Saxe-Weimar to provide 16,000 troops for a campaign in Alsace and the Rhineland, an anti-Spain alliance with the Dutch, and the Treaty of Compi√®gne with Sweden. Phase I; 1635 to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia In May, a French army of 27,000 advanced into the Spanish Netherlands, defeating a smaller Spanish force at Les Avins, before linking up with the Dutch. Outnumbered, the Cardinal-Infante retreated to Leuven; by the time the siege began on 24 June, desertions reduced the French to under 17,000. They withdrew in early July, the Dutch doing the same after the loss of Schenkenschans on 28 July. The States General of the Netherlands opposed further large scale land operations, and instead prioritised attacks on Spanish trade. In 1636, a Spanish offensive reached Corbie in Northern France; although it caused panic in Paris, lack of supplies forced them to retreat, and it was not repeated. Philip focused on recovering territories in the Low Countries, while repulsing Franco-Savoyard attacks in Lombardy. As agreed at Compi√®gne in 1635, the French replaced Swedish garrisons in Alsace; prior to his death in 1639, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar won a series of victories in the Rhineland, notably the capture of Breisach in December 1638. By severing the Spanish Road, it forced Spain to reinforce their armies in Flanders by sea, which was dominated by the Dutch navy; in 1639, they destroyed a large supply convoy at the Downs. They also attacked Portuguese possessions in Africa and the Americas, then part of the Spanish Empire; Madrid's inability to prevent this caused increasing unrest in Portugal. War damage to the economy and increases in taxes led to protests throughout Spanish territories in the 1630s; in 1640, these erupted into open revolts in Portugal and Catalonia. In 1641, the Catalan Courts recognised Louis XIII as Count of Barcelona, and ruler of the Principality of Catalonia. However, they soon found the new administration differed little from the old, turning the war into a three sided contest between the Franco-Catalan elite, the rural peasantry, and the Spanish. Louis XIII died on 14 May 1643, and was succeeded by his five year old son, Louis XIV, whose mother, Anne of Austria, took control of the Regency Council that ruled in his name. Five days later, Cond√©, then known as the duc d'Enghien, defeated the Spanish Army of Flanders at Rocroi; while less decisive than often thought, the loss of this highly experienced unit ended Spanish dominance of the European battlefield. It gave Cond√©, a member of the royal family, and effective ruler of large parts of eastern France, leverage in his struggle with Anne, and Cardinal Mazarin. Despite limited success in Northern France and the Spanish Netherlands, including victory at Lens in August 1648, France was unable to knock Spain out of the war. In Germany, Imperial victories at Tuttlingen and Mergentheim were offset by French success at N√∂rdlingen and Zusmarshausen. In Italy, French-backed Savoyard offensives against the Spanish-ruled Duchy of Milan achieved little, due to lack of resources and the disruption caused by the 1639 to 1642 Piedmontese Civil War. Victory at Orbetello in June 1646, and the recapture of Naples in 1647 left Spain firmly in control of this region. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War and recognised Dutch independence, ending the drain on Spanish resources. Under the October 1648 Treaty of M√ºnster, France gained strategic locations in Alsace and Lorraine, as well as Pinerolo, which controlled access to Alpine passes in Northern Italy. However, the peace excluded Italy, Imperial territories in the Low Countries, and French-occupied Lorraine; although Emperor Ferdinand agreed to remain neutral, fighting continued. Phase II; 1648 to 1659 By 1648, both sides were under increasing financial strain, forcing Philip to prioritise Catalonia, although he could not avoid declaring bankruptcy in 1647 and 1653. His position seemed desperate; in addition to an empty treasury, much of Flanders had been overrun, the key port of Dunkirk lost, and many of his best soldiers died at Rocroi. However, the situation quickly improved after the Peace of Westphalia ended the war with the Dutch, and political conflict and economic stress led to the French civil war known as the Fronde. Philip initially fought on hoping for improved peace terms to those on offer, but as the situation in France deteriorated, the Spanish made substantial gains in the Netherlands, including the recapture of Ypres. In 1650, the Neapolitan Revolt was crushed, while by the end of the year the Catalan rebels controlled Barcelona. With the end of the Fronde, Mazarin forced Cond√© into exile in the Spanish Netherlands, where he signed an alliance with Philip. He was replaced by Turenne, also a talented commander, but far less powerful politically. Spain recaptured Barcelona in October 1652, and although fighting continued in Roussillon, by 1653 the front had stabilised along the modern Pyrenees border. After the Fronde ended in 1653, France resumed its attempts to capture Milan, which provided access to the vulnerable southern border of Habsburg territories in Austria. Despite support from Savoy, the Duke of Modena and Portugal, they failed to achieve this. By now, the two antagonists were exhausted, and neither could establish dominance over the other. From 1654 to 1656, French victories at Arras, Landrecies and Saint-Ghislain were offset by Spanish success at Pavia, in Lombardy, and Valenciennes. Under pressure from Pope Alexander VII, Mazarin offered peace terms, but refused to accept Spain's insistence Cond√© must be restored to his French titles and lands. Philip viewed this as a personal obligation, and with the war apparently going his way, rejected talks. Prior to the 1660s, France lacked a powerful navy of its own, and instead relied on the Dutch, who ceased to provide this after 1648. Since 1654, Spain had been involved in a naval conflict with the English Commonwealth, and in 1657, Mazarin negotiated an Anglo-French alliance. France was required to end its backing for the exiled Charles II, some of whose supporters joined the Spanish as a result. 1658 featured an Anglo-French offensive in North Flanders, the main objective being Dunkirk, a centre for Spanish privateer attacks on English shipping. After the loss of Dunkirk in June, Spain requested a truce, which Mazarin initially refused. However, Cromwell's death led to political chaos in England, while French allies Savoy and Modena ended the war in Northern Italy by agreeing a truce with the Spanish commander, Caracena. Treaty of the Pyrenees and marriage contract Cond√©; exiled in 1651, his restoration was a major obstacle to peace On 8 May 1659, France and Spain began negotiating terms; the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658 weakened England, which was allowed to observe, but excluded from the talks. Although the Anglo-Spanish War was suspended after the 1660 restoration of Charles II, it did not formally end until the 1667 Treaty of Madrid. Under the Treaty of the Pyrenees, signed on November 5, 1659, France gained Artois and Hainaut along its border with the Spanish Netherlands, as well as Roussillon, or Northern Catalonia. These were more significant than often assumed; in combination with the 1648 Treaty of M√ºnster, France strengthened its borders in the east and south-west, while in 1662, Charles II sold Dunkirk to France. Acquisition of Roussillon established the Franco-Spanish border along the Pyrenees, but divided the historic Principality of Catalonia, an event still commemorated each year by French Catalan-speakers in Perpignan. France withdrew support from Afonso VI of Portugal, while Louis XIV renounced his claim to be Count of Barcelona, and king of Catalonia. Cond√© regained his possessions and titles, as did many of his followers, such as the Comte de Montal, but his political power was broken, and he did not hold military command again until 1667. An integral part of the peace negotiations was the marriage contract between Louis and Maria Theresa, which he used to justify the 1666 to 1667 War of Devolution, and formed the basis of French claims over the next 50 years. The marriage was more significant than intended, since it was agreed shortly after Philip's second wife, Mariana of Austria, gave birth to a second son, both of whom died young. Philip died in 1665, leaving his four year old son Charles as king, once described as \\"always on the verge of death, but repeatedly baffling Christendom by continuing to live.\\" Aftermath and historical assessment Maria Theresa, whose marriage to Louis XIV was part of the peace negotiations While the war has been retrospectively viewed as the beginning of the decline of Spain, this was not interpreted as such at the time. Although France made crucial strategic gains around its borders, modern assessments suggest a more balanced outcome. \\"The (1659 treaty) was a peace of equals. Spanish losses were not great, and France returned some territory and strongholds. With hindsight, historians have regarded the treaty as a symbol of the 'decline of Spain' and the 'ascendancy of France'; at that time, however, (it) appeared a far from decisive verdict on the international hierarchy\\". \\"Spain maintained her supremacy in Europe until 1659, and was the greatest imperial power for years after that. Although (its) economic and military power suffered an abrupt decline in the half century after (1659), (it) was a major participant in the European coalitions against Louis XIV, and the peace congresses at Nijmegen in 1678, and Ryswick in 1697\\". David Parrott, Professor of Early Modern History at New College, Oxford suggests that both the Peaces of Westphalia and the Pyrenees reflected mutual exhaustion and stalemate, not a military diktat imposed by victorious powers. Elsewhere, he labels the war \\"25 years of indecisive, over-ambitious and, on occasions, truly disastrous conflict\\". The near equality between the European powers in this period meant the 1635-1659 conflict, like other wars, was inconclusive, Spain and France effectively settling for a draw. Rob Stradling, an expert in Spanish history, and formerly Professor of History at Cardiff University, argues that had France not moderated its demands in 1659, the war would have been continued interminably.

It is an Italian National monument. According to a memorial stone within the building, on which is inscribed a \\"brief\\" by Pope Gregory XIII, Villa Grazioli was completed in 1580 by Cardinal Carafa to designs by architect Domenico Fontana. After Cardinal Carafa's death in 1582, the Villa became owned by Cardinal Ottavio Acquaviva of Aragon and his brother. After Cardinal Acquaviva's death in 1612, the Villa and its furnishings were purchased by Scipione Borghese, who sold it in 1613 to Cardinal Taverna. One year later, Prince Michele Peretti purchased the Villa, who lived in it with his brother Cardinal Alessandro Damasconi Peretti Montalto, whose name appears in the engravings by Matteo Greuter of Frascati's landscape. The Villa then passed by inheritance to the Savelli family and in 1683 passed to Olivo or Livio Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano and Ceri (at which time it was known as Villa Bracciano). In 1713 Baldassare Erba inherited the title and the property; between 1723 and 1743, or possibly in 1776, he had the building thoroughly restructured in both form and size. Although it has been claimed that Alphonse Donatien Francois, the Marquis de Sade, was witness to this renewal, this could not have happened between 1723 and 1743, as de Sade was born in 1740; the date of 1766 does, however, align with de Sade's time in Italy. In 1833 the Collegio Propaganda Fide bought the Villa in 1833; they sold it 10 years later to Duke Pio Grazioli, whose family kept the property for more than a century. In 1943 and 1944, during World War II, the surrounding area was heavily bombed, and the Villa was occupied by squatters, then left in a state of great disrepair. However, in 1987 the Company Villa Grazioli purchased the building and began a thorough restoration of the Villa's architecture, decorations, and park. It has subsequently reopened as a four-star hotel (Park Hotel Villa Grazioli). The Villa is notable for its internal decoration, which has taken place in three periods, corresponding to families who owned the building. In the first period, around 1590, Ottavio Acquaviva commissioned the decoration of the rooms on the main floor, which were completed by 1612. These rooms are now believed to be the work of Agostino Ciampelli (1565‚Äì1630), who depicted the villa with paintings of rural life and rustic scenes. The second period corresponds to ownership by the Montalto family. Cardinal Alessandro Montalto commissioned the central panel of the room's vault, which portrays the biblical theme of Eliah and Elyseus in a fresco by painters from the Bologna school. The third period dates to the Odescalchi period; most notably, the first-floor gallery, now known as \\"Pannini Gallery\\", was created by Giovanni Paolo Panini. An inventory of the Villa, dated 1743, describes this gallery and names Pannini as its painter.

It lies just inside the New Forest. The name Bramshaw means Bramble Wood. Until 1895, Bramshaw was divided into two parts, one half in Wiltshire, and one half in Hampshire. The village of Bramshaw is stretched out for several miles along the B3079 road, with the church to the north, the hamlet of Brook to the south and Stock's Cross at its centre. Overview Bramshaw is a village and civil parish in the New Forest National Park. It includes large tracts of land owned by the National Trust, and Crown Land administered by the Forestry Commission.Welcome to Bramshaw ‚Äì Bramshaw Parish Council It is located some 10 miles west of Southampton. The parish contains the hamlets of Brook and Fritham. Bramshaw Commons, owned by the National Trust, comprise some of manorial wastes and commons.Points of Interest ‚Äì Bramshaw Parish Council It is some of the best surviving example of lowland heath in Europe, still managed by the common grazing of ponies, pigs, donkeys, cattle and sheep. The parish also contains the highest point in the New Forest at Pipers Wait, some 129 metres above mean sea level. The site of a 14th-century Royal Hunting Lodge (\\"Studley Castle\\"), a Scheduled Monument, can be seen nearby. The site of a former stocks and gallows can be seen at Stocks Cross, at the intersection of Furzley Lane and the B3079. The gallows were still in use in 1831, when records show that they were repaired. The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Telegraph Hill, near Bramshaw. It was an optical shutter signal station used as a communication link for the Admiralty during the Napoleonic Wars. History Pigs grazing on the road at Bramshaw Stock's Cross ‚Äì site of a former stocks and gallows Telegraph Hill, site of a former Admiralty signal station Bramshaw appears twice in the Domesday Book for Wiltshire, when the lands were held by Wulfnoth and a certain Edmund. Odo of Bayeux was overlord of these lands in Bramshaw at the time of the Survey. The name Bramshaw probably derives from an Old English word for \\"bramble bush wood.\\"Old Hampshire Gazetteer ‚Äì Bramshaw It may be that it is Bramshaw being referred to in 1418 in a legal record, (appearing as Bremelelsthaw).Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/aCP40no629fronts/IMG_0385.htm; second entry; residence of the second defendant John Porter The manor of Bramshaw, together with that of Britford, appears to have been granted by one of the Norman kings to the family of de Lacy sometime during the 12th century.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Pages 623‚Äì626 In the 15th century it was sold to Robert Lord Hungerford. It switched hands during the Wars of the Roses, but in 1485 it was back in the hands of Hungerford family, being awarded to Mary Hungerford, wife of Sir Edward Hastings. Their grandson, the third Earl, sold the manor of Bramshaw (which from this time seems to have been also known as \\"Moore Closes\\") in 1561. It was sold several times in the next 150 years, until it was purchased in 1713 by Richard Paulet, in whose family the manor remained until 1887. Saint Peter's church belonged at an early date to the Premonstratensian priory of Britford. In 1158, however, Henry II granted the church to Salisbury cathedral, when it was appropriated to the resident canons, and from that date the patronage was in the hands of the Dean and chapter of Salisbury. The current church dates from the 13th century, albeit with many later additions. The earliest part of the church is the west end of the nave, which is of mid-13th-century date, and there is a cambered beam roof of late 15th century date. Much of rest of the church, including the chancel and vestry, are of 19th century construction. Bramshaw was partly in Wiltshire and partly in Hampshire until the \\"County of Southampton Act 1894\\" placed it all into Hampshire. The county boundary ran through the churchyard,History of the Area ‚Äì Bramshaw Parish Council and through the church, which had its nave in Wiltshire and its chancel in Hampshire. There were separate parish councils, one for Bramshaw (Hampshire) and one for Bramshaw (Wiltshire), which survived as Bramshaw (West) and Bramshaw (East) until 1932 when they were unified. Bramshaw village school was founded in 1812 and closed in July 1977.Merson, Elizabeth, Once there was ... a Village School, Southampton; Paul Cave Publications, 1979. Through those 165 years it served the children of Bramshaw and nearby hamlets in the New Forest, Brook, Fritham and Furzley. Children passed through Bramshaw School, usually on their way to labouring and servant jobs in the forest and on the estates. The school began life as a Boys' School, registered as a National School in 1812 with the Girls' and Infants' School being registered in 1819. At that time it was described as 'privately owned', only being registered as a Public Elementary School in 1851 when it began to be supported with government funding. George Eyre (1772-1837), owner of the local Warrens Estate.British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56897. founded the school, 'demonstrating a paternalistic attitude to the labourers and their children, while providing a picturesque addition to the village scene'.Merson, 1979, p.8. The school remained connected to the Eyre family until the death of the then Mrs Eyre in 1933.Merson, 1979, p.86 After the 1944 Education Act introduced the eleven plus examination, older boys and girls moved to a new Secondary Modern School at Bartley, leaving two classes of 5 to 7 and 7 to 11 year-olds.

He was born Bernhard Eskeles, the posthumous son of Rabbi Issachar Berush Eskeles,JewishEncyclopedia.com - ESKELES, ISSACHAR BERUSH: son of the Polish- Moravian Rabbi Gabriel Eskeles. At an early age he went to Amsterdam, where he entered a commercial house, of which he became manager at the age of 17, but met with reverses, and lost the fortune which his father had left to him. In 1774 he returned to Vienna, married Caecilie (Zipperche) Itzig (1760‚Äì1836), a daughter of Daniel Itzig of Berlin, and joined in partnership and entered the business of his brother-in-law Nathan Arnstein, with whom he established the banking-house of Arnstein and Eskeles, which came into great prominence during the Congress of Vienna. They were patrons of Mozart and also of Ignaz Moscheles who gave piano lessons to Caecilie. At this period Eskeles's drawing-room was the rendezvous of men like Talleyrand, Wellington, Castlereagh, Hardenberg, and Theodor K√∂rner. Eskeles's name is often mentioned in the memoirs of this time. His advice in financial matters was frequently sought by Emperors Joseph II, and later by Francis II and I, who entrusted him with many important missions to foreign countries. He was sent to Paris and Holland in 1810. Eskeles was the founder of the Austrian National Bank (1816), and its director for 23 years. He was raised to the Austrian nobility in 1797, and became a knight in 1811, and a baron in 1822. Eskeles took little interest in Jewish affairs, and during his short term of office as representative of the Jewish community new and vexatious measures were introduced which, according to his contemporaries, he might have prevented had he used his influence. He was, however, the founder of several charitable institutions. He also established, with an initial contribution of 50,000 gulden, a fund for the maintenance of poor students. His two children, a son, Denis, Baron de Eskeles (1803-1876), and a daughter, Maria Anna (Marianne) Cecilia Bernhardine Freiin von Eskeles, Countess of Wimpffen, wife of Franz Graf von Wimpffen, deserted Judaism. Denis, who succeeded his father in the management of the banking-house, married Wilhelmina, Baroness Brentano-Cimaroli, and by his death the male line of the house became extinct.

Work at Efteling  After graduation in 1963, Van de Ven applied for a job at Efteling in 1965. Anton Pieck, leading designer at the time, only asked him one question: \\"Do you master perspective?\\" Ton bent the truth a little to say that he did. He then started to work with Pieck on various aspects of the park, gradually developing his own style, which never conflicted with the existing styles in the park. Van de Ven's first project was to work with Pieck on the Indian Waterlilies. After a few sketches Pieck was convinced that he could fully trust the park in the hands of Van de Ven. When Pieck retired in 1975, Ton became the creative director of the park. Van de Ven's first \\"own\\" ride was the Haunted Castle (\\"Spookslot\\") in 1978, the first big attraction in the park. He created many of the current Efteling landmarks, of which Fata Morgana and Dreamflight are considered to be his masterpieces. In 2002 Van de Ven retired from the park, and he could concentrate on his hobby - creating large paintings and sculptures of women.

In Germany, there are about 15 described species. There is at least one in the United States. They favor dry climates. The species in this genus have been traditionally grouped into sibling species complexes (groups) based on morphological characters, but, as morphology-based taxonomy can be unreliable, alternative methods have also been employed to identify species correctly. For example, differences in observed courtship and copulation behaviour have proved to be a useful tool for species identification and delimitation, particularly in cryptic species. Molecular techniques have also been applied to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between some species. References (2008): The world spider catalog, version 8.5.
