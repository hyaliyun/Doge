An SDP infrastructure is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure. The SDP architecture partitions the security infrastructure into three interconnected layers. The Enforcement Layer inspects traffic and enforces protection within well-defined network segments. The Control Layer generates security policies and deploys those protections to enforcement points. The Management Layer orchestrates the infrastructure and integrates security with business processes. The SDP architecture supports traditional network security and access control policy requirements, as well as the threat prevention required for enterprises implementing technologies such as mobile computing and software-defined Networking (SDN). Enforcement Layer The Enforcement Layer of SDP enables organizations to design segmented networks, implement physical and virtual security enforcement points based upon that segmentation, and execute the protection logic for the prescribed network segments. SDP incorporates the principal of segmentation into the Enforcement Layer. Segmentation divides a network into compartments that have different security characteristics. Based upon segment requirements, security controls are established for threat containment and recovery. Enforcement points, or platforms for executing protections, must then be implemented at the boundaries of the segments to enforce the defined protection logic. Enforcement points may be implemented as network security gateways, host-based software, mobile device applications, or virtual machines in the cloud. Control Layer The Control Layer is the core of the SDP architecture. Its role is to generate protections and deploy them for execution at the appropriate enforcement points within the Enforcement Layer. To develop the appropriate protections, the Control Layer relies upon repositories of data that include knowledge of the organization and its information systems (Access Control), knowledge of data assets and their classifications (data protection) and knowledge of threats (threat prevention). Security Solutions commonly implemented within the Control layer include firewall, anti-virus, application control, threat emulation, anti-bot, anti-spam and email security, data loss prevention (DLP), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Through systematic mapping of these protective controls to the associated risk for each segment and its assets within the Enforcement Layer, organizations can deliver multi- layer protection against attacks. Management Layer The Management Layer serves as the interface between network administrators and the other two layers of the SDP infrastructure. This layer supports the enterprise segmentation and enables the definition of access and data control policies and the activation of threat prevention separately. The Management Layer also provides the ability to delegate management to specific administrators who can work with them simultaneously. The Management Layer provides visibility into what is happening in the network, supports proactive incident response, and provides the intelligence required to tailor security controls for the organization.

Tropic of Orange. Minneapolis: Coffee House Press, 1997. Published in 1997, the novel is generally considered a work of magic realism but can also be considered science fiction, postcolonial literature, speculative fiction, postmodern literature, world literature, or literature of transnationalism.Kim, Dorothy. \\"Karen Tei Yamashita's Tropic of Orange: Postcolonial Discourse and (Re)Visions of America at the Century's Edge.\\" Ed. Koski, Lena M. American Studies at the Millennium: Ethnicity, Culture & Literature. Turku, Finnland: Turku University Press. 2001. 211-230. Plot Tropic of Orange revolves around seven distinct, yet interrelated characters and story lines (listed in bold below). The story covers the span of seven days, with each day getting its own unit, and with each character getting one chapter for each day. In Los Angeles, Japanese-American television news executive, Emi, and her lover, Latino journalist Gabriel Balboa, are chasing newsworthy stories of local disaster, including an apocalyptic standstill on the Harbor Freeway and the creation of a new urban social order by homeless population moving into the abandoned cars. One of Gabriel's most reliable sources is Buzzworm, an African American man who roams LA streets dispensing advice and help. Buzzworm gives Gabriel a few newsworthy tips, such as the mysterious package arriving at the L.A. airport and the presence of Manzanar Murakami, a Sansei and former doctor who conducts freeway traffic from an overpass as if they were symphonies. Gabriel also owns a home near Mazatl√°n, Mexico, which is being tended by Mexican-American Rafaela Cortes during her separation from husband Bobby Ngu. Gabriel's Mexican home is the site of early anomalies that become increasingly visible and widespread as the novel progresses, including a special orange that falls from Rafaela's favorite tree at the home. This orange is picked up by the mystical Arcangel, who carries the fruit across the U.S.-Mexico border and, with it, the Tropic of Cancer. Rafaela also overhears a conversation between two men that makes her fear for the safety of herself and her son, Sol. Meanwhile, Bobby, who has been trying to locate Rafaela and Sol, is mysteriously informed of the arrival of a young Chinese girl who may or may not be a cousin of his. In addition to the mystical orange, the plot includes illegal human organ harvesting in Mexico, a shipment of poisoned oranges from Brazil, a wrestling match between \\"SuperNAFTA\\" and \\"El Gran Mojado\\", a mystical symphony that connects everyone in L.A., and moments in which time and space become distorted. Major themes Central to the importance of Tropic of Orange is its work in decentering normative narratives of race and space in Los Angeles and its cultural texts. Asian American literary scholar Ruth Hsu argues that the images of the novel \\"decenter[s] the dominant Anglo-Euro-American narratives about Los Angeles, the ones that empower and maintain the dominant image of white and Western superiority. And the novel does so by appropriating and redeploying the hegemonic tropes of cartography and geography in ways that map Western colonialism and the buried sites (longitude and latitude figured in the parole of history) of prehistoric rivers, flora, and fauna, and 'native' resistance as well as the ongoing transgressions of African Americans, Asian migrants, Latino/as, just to name a few of the other who have and are inhabiting the geography‚Äîin the deep sense‚Äîof Los Angeles.\\"Hsu, Ruth Y. \\"The Cartography of Justice and Truthful Refractions in Karen Tei Yamashita's Tropic of Orange. Ed. Shirley Lim, et al. Transnational Asian American Literature: Sites and Transits. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2006. Scholars of third-world women's writing and Chicana/o studies have written about Tropic of Orange as a text that incorporates elements of Chicanismo as it deals with issues of contested geopolitical borders. This has been related to the study of migration and ethnic exclusion, but also in drawing connections to diasporic politics beyond single ethnic, racial, or national groups. Claudia Sadowski-Smith writes, \\"Yamashita employ[s] the same precolonial myths to simultaneously stress transnational and cross-cultural groups who populate the borderlands.\\" Sadowski-Smith, Claudia. \\"The U.S.-Mexico Borderlands Write Back: Cross-Cultural Transnationalism in Contemporary U.S. Women of Color Fiction.\\" Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory.

Literary significance and reception Tropic of Orange has been generally well-received and praised for its ambition and scope, but criticized for its explicit politics. For example, Janet Kaye for the New York Times, writes that the novel is \\"fiercely satirical\\" but \\"disappoints as it heads for the home stretch, when her playful seriousness too often gives way to pedantic polemics.\\"Kaye, Janet. \\"Tropic of Orange by Karen Tei Yamashita.\\" New York Times Books. 4 January 1998.

As a child, she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in Kandahar, Afghan. Her work is considered to challenge traditional Muslim culture like the burqa. According to Suliman, \\"The burqa is a way of controlling, but in the name of respect. Every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa. It is honor, culture, and religion. Really, it just controls the woman and keeps her inside.\\" Malina's work has gained the attention of the Taliban and traditional Muslims, resulting in having received threats from the Taliban towards Suliman and her family. Not only does Malina worry about the Taliban, but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art. Writing art that that displays the human body like Malina's motif, the skeleton in a burqa, is seen as idol worship. To the Taliban and other traditional Muslims, Malina's artwork is un- Islamic and Suliman's parents were embarrassed. Because of this her parents went the distance and locked Malina in their house for nearly a year, which had the opposite effect they were hoping for. Malina claimed that, ‚ÄúToday, whatever I am doing for art, it‚Äôs all because of that one year in which I was staying in a home.‚Äù Suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world. In December 2019, Malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in Rome but it was cancelled.  Education  Suliman studied Realism Art in Pakistan, without the knowledge of her father, and eventually received her bachelors at the Art Council Karachi of Fine Arts but her studies were cut short when her parents asked her to return home. She was kept at home for year without access to internet. While she was at Kabul, she joined the Berang Arts Association where she picked up graffiti through workshops. In 2013, an attack on her father pushed the family to move to Mumbai, India. There, she studied at the Sir J.J School of Art. In 2014, She relocated to the Netherlands where she started her M.A at the Dutch Art Institute.  Career  Malina had an interest in art since childhood. She described her interest as art attracting her instinctively so she could feel it inside her. While Malina was home for the ten months, she felt she lost her identity, and it had a large impact. It wasn't until her sister's husband took her to an exhibit that she found her identity again. \\"I started shouting and crying, and I felt like I was back, and I existed again.\\"-Malina Suliman. It was then that began to do art despite the knowledge that she would receive resistance from her family and from other people. Her writing the graffiti attracted comments from passerbys. She would also get assaulted by people throwing rocks, who followed her if she tried to relocate. The Taliban was the most vocal against her work. They have said that Suliman's work is idol-worshipping and anti-Islam. This resulted in violent actions taken against Suliman and her family. Once Malina started holding her exhibits, she received threats warning her not to attend her own exhibits. In one exhibit in Kandahar, she attracted the attention of the Governor, Tooryalai Wesa, who praised her work hoping that \\"more women would do the same.\\" Suliman's art earned her an invitation to President Hamid Karzai's palace to showcase her work in a private viewing. She also joined a local art group, the Kandahar Fine Arts Association, to bring an art scene that would be alive in her deeply conservative hometown. The group was all male and relatively small but has gained many female artists since. In 2015, Malina participated in a painting and sculpture exhibition at the French Cultural Center in Kabul. The same year, Suliman's work was the focus of a solo exhibition at the Art Represent gallery in Bethnal Green, London. The show, entitled 'Beyond the Veil: A Decontextualization', saw the installation of a number of burqas, each inscribed with the wishes and aspirations of Afghan citizens in a traditional form of calligraphy. A movie released in 2016 called 'Tasting the Moon' featuring Malina Suliman, Shamsia Hassani, and Nabila Horakhsh. The movie is about First Generation of Afghan Female Contemporary Artists and contains a trilogy of impressionistic dream sequences inspired by re-occurring metaphors in each artist's work.  Art  Malina's art didn't become political until she moved back to Afghanistan. After seeing the discrimination she and other women faced, Suliman's art sought to advocate for women's rights in Afghanistan. Her most famous graffiti art is the image of a skeleton wearing a blue burqa. Suliman always felt like the burqa controlled her as child. To Malina, the skeleton is a self portrait that means a lack of identity for women in Afghanistan, inequality because women are treated as second class citizens in Afghan, and oppression for the women who are killed asking for rights. One of her more morbid and darker works includes a gruesome scene in the aftermath of a suicide bombing. Malina depicts the reaction of people in a statement during an interview. ‚ÄúMany people had never seen an art installation... Some were offended and others were hurt because they‚Äôd experienced it before.\\" Suliman's work is very personal as well. She experienced a suicide bombing at an exhibit but made it out safely without any injuries. Skeleton in a Burqa Malina also faces the reality of being a controversial figure in Afghanistan, knowing that she could be killed for her art. Not only does her art covers the political and war scene of Afghan but she also covers her life and parents in an artwork titled \\"Today's Life\\". This painting depicts a fetus in a womb that is suspended from tree being pulled in different directions. For Malina, her fate had already been decided before she was born. ‚ÄúBefore a child is born, the parents are already thinking that a son can support them and a daughter can be married off to a wealthy suitor. They don‚Äôt stop to think what the child may want.\\" For Malina, her art is a form of resistance against the Taliban and traditional rules. Although the spotlight on her is dangerous in Afghanistan, Malina wants to challenge politics, culture, and women's rights. Malina said in an interview, \\"I felt like OK, if I don‚Äôt say something, who will?\\" For this reason, Malina uses graffiti, to \\"give voice to the walls\\" in Afghanistan.

The project consists of a network of footpaths that provide access to the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, the Acropolis of Athens and the Philopappos Hill from Dionysiou Areopagitou Street and Apostolou Pavlou Street. It included the renovation of the chapel of Saint Demetrios Loumbardiaris and its churchyard. General idea The general idea of the plan was laid out in marking the paths and selecting a series of points related to orientation and views. This was done by Pikionis's intuition. Pikionis wanted to provide a sequence of emotions such as surprise, admiration and curiosity to the visitor before he could reach the Acropolis or Philopappos Hill. Classical and traditional architecture as well as Japanese influences were merged and created a contemporary design that embraces and idealizes Greek tradition. Materials Pikionis collected marble and clay shards left over from the demolished buildings of nineteenth-century Athens and composed them into a collage in the paths. These pieces were put together with new marble stones and concrete elements into ornaments and fragments referring to the past and based on traditional elements. All patterns and shapes of paving, gutters, steps and seats merge naturally into an art piece. Improvised construction The project was done with Pikionis's intuition and aesthetic sensibility about the site. A general idea was laid out; however, the design was never specified in detail. Everything was adapted in situ during the construction which was carried out by small construction teams that Pikionis supervised and guided through suggestions, examples and dialogue. He quoted: ‚ÄúThe common architectural supervision would be totally inadequate and the architect should build the work himself through the hands of his craftsmen‚Äù. By supporting craftsmen's creativity he achieved a perfect result between his guidance and the workers' execution: ‚ÄúTry it as you know; you have your own way. I only gave an idea. I am sure you can set it up better‚Äù. His thinking is in a way close to Le Corbusier's during his brutalism period, when he considered incidental imperfection done by workers a beautiful part of the finished project. Criticism As Pikionis relied solely on his intuition and artistic sensitivity and not on any historical or archeological research during the project, he was criticized after the completion of the project. For Pikionis's defense professor Charalambos Bouras said: ‚ÄúPikionis approaches the ancients by deviating from history. He is to establish his personal relationship with the object‚Äù.

Life  He belonged to a noble but poor family that originally came from Fulda and was barely more than a child when he began studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, under Hubert Maurer. He came under the influence of the Nazarene movement, however, and moved away from the Academic painting style. In 1812, he took a trip to Venice to visit his sister, then went on to Ferrara, which is the place where he may have contracted the tuberculosis that would cause his early death. When he returned from Italy, he settled in Klagenfurt, where the Prince-bishop of Gurk, , became his patron and appointed him Court Painter. In 1814, he was able to undertake another, extensive tour of Italy, during which he was admitted to see Pope Pius VII and received the Supreme Order of Christ for painting the Pope's portrait. After that, his friends jokingly referred to him as \\"Raffaelino\\" (Little Raphael). In 1816, he returned to Klagenfurt and fell seriously ill. He moved to Vienna in 1819 and took a last trip to Italy from 1820 to 1821. Back in Vienna he was rejected by his long-time love, Caecilia Bontzak, who felt ignored, and his illness worsened rapidly. He died just a few months after his 26th birthday. References  Further reading  Michael Krapf, Johann Evangelist Scheffer von Leonhardshoff 1795-1822. Ein Mitglied des Lukasbundes in Wien.

It was first published on March 18, 2002, through Clarion Books. The book is set in Korea during World War II, when Japan conquered Korea and was trying to destroy Korean culture. The story is told from the perspectives of two Korean siblings, Tae-Yul and Sun-hee.  Summary This story takes place in Korea during the 1940s. This book is told through the different perspectives of Sun-Hee, and her brother Tae-Yul. They, along with all Korean citizens, are forced to adopt new names in Japanese to reflect the new law put out by the Japanese government. Sun-hee's family chooses the last name of \\"Kaneyama\\" for the family because, when translated, it means geumsan, a county in South Korea. For their first names, each family member picks a random letter in the Japanese alphabet that will be the first letter of their name. Sun-hee chose the letter K and Tae-Yul chose N, so their names became Kaneyama Keoko and Kaneyama Nobuo. As the book progresses the story switches between Sun-hee/Keoko's time in school with her friend Tomo and interest in Japanese kanji, and Tae-Yul/Nobuo's interest in machinery. Due to Japan attacking Korea, food is scarce, and Sun-hee and Tae-Yul's family members often fight with each other. Things grow tenser after the United States enters the war, giving Tae-Yul his first glimpse of an airplane, which prompts him to fantasize about flying one himself. Life for the siblings is relatively dull except for the occasional news given out by the neighborhood block leader. During this time all citizens are ordered to stop their activities and head out to the streets to listen to the news, which was given to the block leaders by government officials. One night Sun-hee is sent to deliver her uncle his dinner, as he has been spending more and more time at his job in a printing shop. On her way there she is stopped by her friend Tomo, who gives her a vague warning that she takes to mean that her uncle is in danger. Sun-hee's uncle runs off after hearing the warning and Tae-yul's narration reveals that their uncle had been printing newspapers for the resistance. However, Sun-hee soon finds that Tomo's warning did not indicate that the government was aware of his activities with the resistance, but that they were going to take all metal items (including the printing press) and donate them to the military. This means that her uncle's escape was for no reason, which became more tragic once his flight is announced by one of the neighborhood block leaders. As the days progress, the siblings hear more news about kamikaze pilots, which fascinates Tae-Yul. Eventually, Tae-Yul is approached by the police, who want him to arrange a meeting with his uncle. This puts Tae-Yul under a lot of pressure since accepting it would end with his uncle's arrest and refusing it would put him at the mercy of the government. He ends up enlisting in the Imperial Japanese Army as it would allow him to leave the country without having to accept or decline the police's request. While Tae-Yul is in training, he overhears two Japanese officers joking and sneering about Koreans in relation to a volunteer mission, as they viewed them as too worthless and cowardly to volunteer. Because of this, Tae-Yul immediately volunteers, only to discover that it is for a kamikaze mission. Tae-yul is put through rudimentary flight training that is cut short due to a lack of Japanese soldiers. Tae-Yul secretly plans a way to escape the certain death that would come from his mission. He is spared from this fate when the day for the mission arrives as the weather makes it impossible for the pilots to successfully fly. Tae-Yul and the others return to base where they are arrested. Months later the block leaders announce that Japan had lost the war to the United States. Tae-yul returns home, where he confesses to his family that his plan was that when the time came, he would take out another kamikaze pilot instead of aiming at the American ships. Home and together again, Sun- hee teaches her brother the Korean alphabet, which she learned from their father after Korea was freed. Reception Critical reception has been positive, and When My Name Was Keoko has received a review from the School Library Journal and two reviews from the Horn Book Guide. AudioFile praised the book's story while criticizing that the audiobook narration was \\"at times flat and without emotion\\". Publishers Weekly gave When My Name Was Keoko a starred review and wrote \\"Through the use of the shifting narrators, Park subtly points up the differences between male and female roles in Korean society and telling details provide a clear picture of the siblings and their world.\\" Kliatt and Reading Time both praised the work and Kliatt commented that it would be of good use in classrooms, especially those focused in literary, history, or had \\"students of Korean roots and good students who like substance in their stories.\\" =Awards= CCBC Newbery Award Discussion *Honor Book, CCBC Printz Award Discussion  References   American children's novels  Children's historical novels Novels set during World War II 2002 American novels  Novels set in Korea  Novels by Linda Sue Park 2002 children's books ","title":"When My Name Was Keoko"},{"id":"42925637","text":"Leribe Airport is an airport serving Hlotse, the camptown (capital) of the Leribe District of Lesotho.

The film stars Vinay, Madhurima and Preethi Christina Paul in the lead roles. The music was composed by Vishnu Mohan. The film was released on 6 March 2015. Plot The movie starts off with Kumaran (Thambi Ramaiah) telling his wife that he is going to a temple. Actually, he spends two days of each month with women he meets on the Internet. His old- fashioned wife does not suspect anything. While Kumaran is driving, he finds Abhishek (Vinay) unconscious on the road. Abhishek then tells his story to Kumaran on how he ended up on the road. Abhishek is a disheveled photographer who meets up with his friend, who is a florist. There, he sees Julie (Preethi Christina), who is shopping and is in a hurry. She asks Abhishek to drive her around for the day for $500. He agrees and borrows his friend's car for the day. At the end of the day, Julie invites him, a man she has no clue about, into her house and asks him to make coffee. While he is making coffee, she gets dressed and asks him to zip her dress up for her. It is revealed that Julie wants to be a model for Vogue magazine and was meant to be meeting a famous fashion photographer for an opportunity. She then instructs Abhishek to drive to the photographer's house. Once they reach their destination, Abhishek reveals that he is the well-known photographer that she was going to see. They fall in love. A montage song shows them travelling together all over New Zealand. Julie's parents find out, and as they do not approve of their relationship, they decide to get her married by force. Meanwhile, Abhishek's childhood friend Sherin (Madhurima) sees a picture in an art gallery and tells the manager about Abhishek, his friends, and her childhood. Sherin spots a heartbroken and drunk Abhishek in a bar and escorts him to a hotel. There are some awkward circumstances between them, but Abhishek tells her full story once he is sober. Sherin talks about her dead brother's murder that happened in their \\"secret place\\" and pretends to help Abhishek get Julie back. However, Sherin is convinced that Abhishek murdered her brother because he was the last person to see him at the secret place and wants to avenge him. The story cuts back to the present day, where Kumaran is seen together in bed with a woman and leaves hurriedly when her husband returns. Sherin and Abhishek try to find Julie, but they are in no hurry. Sherin then meets Julie and tells Abishek to forget her.

It was released on May 28, 2014. The album is a mixture of original and cover songs using both contemporary and classical Persian poetry. At times, Namjoo attempts to juxtapose or fuse Persian and popular western styles of music, particularly in \\"Roo Dast\\" (Eric Clapton's acoustic \\"Layla\\") and \\"Golmammad\\" (Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"). Some suggest that \\"Golmammad\\" is an homage to Gol Mohammad, the hero of the story of Kelidar, written by the notable Iranian writer, Mahmoud Dolatabadi. However, in interviews, Namjoo has stated that \\"Golmammad\\" has been based on a traditional song from Sabzevar and that he didn't have the hero of Kelidar in mind at the time of writing it. The song \\"Adam-e Pooch\\" is a cover version of \\"Nahang\\" (The Whale) by the late Ebrahim Monsefi, an Iranian musician and singer from Bandar Abbas, Iran. Namjoo dedicated the album to his brother, Mahmoud Namjoo: To his art filled with respect for life.  Title  The title of the album suggests the possibility of drawing inspiration and strength from an ordinary object like a tangerine. The song \\"Narengi\\" (Persian for tangerine) makes a reference to the album name and morphs its way from a traditional Sufi song rooted in the Magham music of Torbat-e Jam (Namjoo's birthplace) crying \\"O God, Help me, Sheikh Ahmad-e Jami, Help me,\\" to Namjoo's own words praising a tagerine.

Namjoo's lyric refers to Reza Khan as an \\"opium addict, with a bad temper who killed his enemies and brought modernity to Iran.\\" This angered the Iranian pro-monarchists who flooded Namjoo's Facebook page with obscenities against Namjoo. The song, however, is more about how a dictator imposed a notion of modernity on a society that was unprepared to absorb it. In a sense, it's primarily a critique of the society and culture in Iran, rather than Reza Khan.

In 1825, he became a \\"pensioner\\" of the Academy, on condition that he continue to study and improve. He received a gold medal and a stipend for a study trip outside of Russia in 1830, as recognition for his painting \\"Socrates, Before his Death, Talking with Students About the Immortality of the Soul\\". He visited Dresden and Rome, copying frescoes and paintings, notably those of Raphael, as well as producing his own. In 1836, his work \\"Fortune and the Beggar\\" brought him the title of Academician. In 1842, for his painting of Christian martyrs in the Colosseum, he was named a Professor (2nd Degree). Ten years later, he was promoted to Professor (1st Degree) and was awarded the title of Distinguished Professor in 1865. Although he was an excellent craftsman, his chief contribution to Russian art was his diligent teaching. He sought out young artists, who in turn favored his classes when requesting apprenticeships. In addition to his paintings, he created frescoes and decorative works. One of his most prominent is \\"Joseph Meeting his Brothers in Egypt\\", in the attic of Saint Isaac's Cathedral. He also performed the drawings and composition for the depiction of the Trinitarian God on the ceiling of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, although the actual work was executed by Ivan Makarov, Ivan Kramskoi, Nikolay Koshelev and .

History The Addenbrooke‚Äôs Cognitive Examination was originally developed as a theoretically motivated extension of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) which attempted to address the neuropsychological omissions and improve the screening performance of the latter. The ACE encompassed tests of five cognitive domains: attention/orientation, memory, language, verbal fluency, and visuospatial skills. It is scored out of 100, with a higher score denoting better cognitive function. At the recommended cut-off scores of 88 and 83, the ACE was reported to have good sensitivity and specificity for identifying different forms of dementia and other impairments of memory and judgement (0.93 and 0.71; 0.82 and 0.96, respectively). The ACE also incorporated the MMSE, such that this score (out of 30) might also be generated. The ACE-R was a development of the earlier ACE which also incorporated the MMSE, but had clearly defined subdomain scores. The ACE-III was developed to improve the performance of certain parts of the test and also to avoid a potential copyright violation by replacing the elements shared with the MMSE. Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III The current version of the test is the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III). This consists of 19 activities which test five cognitive domains: attention, memory, fluency, language and visuospatial processing. =Attention= Attention is tested by asking the patient for the date including the season and the current location; repeating back three simple words; and serial subtraction. An example is something like \\"subtract seven from 100 and then continue subtracting seven away from each new number.\\" =Memory= Memory is tested by asking the patient to recall the three words previously repeated; memorising and recalling a fictional name and address; and recalling widely known historical facts. The memory section is split into five sections scattered throughout the tests. https://www.helpguide.org/articles/alzheimers-dementia-aging/age- related-memory-loss.htm Smith, Melinda; Robinson, Lawrence; Segel, Roberts. (July 2019). Age-Related Memory loss. HelpGuide. =Fluency= Fluency is tested by asking the patient to say as many words as they can think of starting with a specified letter within one minute; and naming as many animals as they can think of in one minute. An example of this would be the tester asking the test taker to list every word they can think of that starts with the letter C. =Language= Language is tested by asking the patient to complete a set of sequenced physical commands using a pencil and piece of paper such as \\"place the paper on top of the pencil\\"; to write two grammatically-complete sentences; to repeat several polysyllabic words and two short proverbs; to name the objects shown in 12 line drawings, and answer contextual questions about some of the objects; and to read aloud five commonly-mispronounced words. Language involves ascribing meaning to words and statements so this section consists of simple directions that may involve movements, such as the example of placing the paper on top of the pencil, to see how well they apply meaning. Because language is valuable and important to functioning in society, this section is the longest consisting of seven separate parts. =Visuospatial= Visuospatial skills are used almost daily to remember directions, addresses, and layout of familiar places.https://www.neuronup.com/en/areas/functions/visuospatial. Neuron Up. (2012). Visuospatial Skills. Neuron Up. Visuospatial abilities are tested by asking the patient to copy two diagrams; to draw a clock face with the hands set at a specified time; to count sets of dots; and to recognize four letters which are partially obscured. =Scoring= The results of each activity are scored to give a total score out of 100 (18 points for attention, 26 for memory, 14 for fluency, 26 for language, 16 for visuospatial processing). The score needs to be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall history and examination, but a score of 88 and above is considered normal; below 83 is abnormal; and between 83 and 87 is inconclusive. =Validity= In the initial validation study the cohort examined (n = 86; AD 28, FTD 33, controls 25) found the ACE-III to be acceptable and relatively quick to administer (15 min). The ACE-III and ACE-R were highly correlated (r = 0.99), and at the previously recommended cut-off scores (88 and 82) the ACE-III was both highly sensitive and specific (at 88/100: 1.00 and 0.96 respectively; at 82/100: 0.93 and 1.00 respectively). At the cut-off of 88, Elamin and colleagues found the ACE-III distinguished early-onset dementia from healthy controls with high sensitivity (0.915) and specificity (0.964), and also from subjective memory impairment with high sensitivity (0.915) and specificity (0.867). The ACE-III has been validated against standard neuropsychological tests and has been shown to be a valid cognitive screening tool for dementia syndromes. Based on the results of a 2019 Cochrane meta-analysis of available studies the ACE-III should only be used as a adjunct to a full clinical assessment and not alone for the screening of dementia or mild cognitive impairment in patients presenting with or at risk for cognitive decline. Translations and localised versions The ACE-III questionnaire has been translated into 19 languages. The English-language version has been localised for users in Australia, India, The United States, The United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Mini-ACE In 2014, a shorter version of the ACE-III, the Mini-ACE (M-ACE), was developed and validated. It comprises tests of attention, memory (7-item name and address), letter fluency, clock drawing, and memory recall, and takes under five minutes to administer. The M-ACE is scored out of 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive function, and has two recommended cut-off scores (25 and 21). The higher cut-off score has both high specificity and sensitivity and is at least five times more likely to have come from a dementia patient than without. A score of 21 or less is almost certainly diagnostic of a dementia syndrome regardless of the clinical setting. It has been found to be superior to the MMSE in diagnostic utility. Based on the results of a 2019 Cochrane meta-analysis of available studies the Mini-ACE should only be used as a adjunct to a full clinical assessment and not alone for the screening of dementia or mild cognitive impairment in patients presenting with or at risk for cognitive decline.

The station is located on the Randers-Aalborg Line from Randers to Aalborg and is the southern terminus of the Aalborg Commuter Rail service. It opened in 1869. The train services are currently operated by the railway companies DSB and Nordjyske Jernbaner.  History  Platforms of Sk√∏rping station The station opened in 1869 with the opening of the Randers-Aalborg railway line from Randers to Aalborg. It survived a series of station closures in the 1970s. In 2003 it became the southern terminus of the new Aalborg Commuter Rail service.  Operations  The train services are operated by the railway companies DSB and Nordjyske Jernbaner. The station offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen and Aalborg, regional train services to Aarhus and Aalborg as well as commuter train services to Aalborg. In literature Danish writer Herman Bang's novel Ved Vejen was inspired by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Sk√∏rping Station. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her pale face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: \\"For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing ‚Äî longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines ‚Äî just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with the same look over Egnens Lyng ‚Äî over the dreary plain.\\" Bang started writing the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Sk√∏rping Station: \\"It was in one of those windows behind the flowers that I saw her face, a face which I had not been able to erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, I felt like drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover illustration for this book.\\"Johannes Fibiger, \\"Hvordan Bang blev forfatter\\", Forfatterweb.

Berkeley Mews is a small street in London. Background \\"Berkeley Mews\\" was recorded during the sessions for The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, despite not appearing on any lineups of the album. However, Reprise planned to release an album called Four More Respected Gentlemen in America at the same time that Village Green Preservation Society was to release in the UK. Later, once Reprise decided that the 15-track version of Village Green Preservation Society was suitable for American release, the Four More Respected Gentlemen album was shelved, leaving \\"Berkeley Mews\\" unreleased. An acetate from March 1968 was later discovered, with a pairing of \\"Rosemary Rose\\" (another shelved track from The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society) and \\"Berkeley Mews\\" on it. This could have possibly been an early proposed single. In 1969, the song was released for the first time on a U.S. compilation album, Then, Now, and Inbetween. A year later, the track saw release in the U.K. as the B-side of their immensely popular single, \\"Lola\\" although a Dave Davies-penned track, \\"Mindless Child of Motherhood\\", was the American B-side. The \\"Lola\\" single hit #2 in Britain. Upon purchasing the \\"Lola\\" single, Pete Quaife (who had quit the band by the single's release date) was shocked to hear \\"Berkeley Mews\\" on the flipside. \\"I thought, is that me? Wait a minute - it is me!\\" Quaife said. Music and lyrics The song, like most Kinks songs, is sung by Ray Davies. The piano, played by session man Nicky Hopkins, is played in a honky-tonk fashion. The track features brass at the end, quite unusual for a The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society-era track. The lyrics talk about a man who believed he had found an \\"intellect\\" in Berkeley Mews, only to discover that this person \\"drowned [his] conversation with champagne\\" and \\"left [him] reeling.\\" He ends by saying, \\"You know that you left me broken hearted in Berkeley Mews.\\" Other appearances \\"Berkeley Mews\\" made an appearance on the 1972 album The Kink Kronikles, as well as the album Picture Book.

He became a city governor and armed many local Muslims and organized them as militia during the war.  During World War II  In December 1941 Zvizdiƒá refused to allow Partisans to capture Sjenica because he was afraid that Chetniks, German and Italian forces would attack Partisans in Sjenica and kill many of its population as well. He explained to Partisans that he had around 5,000 members of Muslim militia under his command and that he will used them against Partisans or Chetniks if they try to capture Sjenica. According to historian ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Zvizdiƒá was actually concerned that his lucrative contracts to supply Italian and German army with livestock would be cancelled if Partisans capture the city. On 22 December 1941 forces of Muslim militia from Prijepolje, commanded by Paƒçariz, and from Sjenica commanded by Zvizdiƒá successfully repelled the attack of Partisans who tried to capture Sjenica. They were supported by one company from Tutin, commanded by D≈æemail Koniƒçanin, who joined them based on invitation of Zvizdiƒá. At the beginning of February 1942 detachments of Muslim militia from Sjenica under command of Zvizdiƒá, together with Prijepolje, Brodarevo and Komaran militia detachments in cooperation with Chetniks under command of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá and with Italian forces, were planned to attack Partisans who were retreating through Sand≈æak after their defeat in U≈æice. When Paƒçariz realized that Partisans managed to defeat Chetniks, he did not dare to attack Partisans, but decided to move his forces to Sjenica to help Zvizdiƒá in case Partisans decide to attack the town again. Zvizdiƒá was very influential not only in Sjenica and Tutin, but also in wider region. He thought that it is useful to visit Chetnik headquarter and to negotiate with Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá. On 27 June Zvizdiƒá and other Muslim and Albanian leaders (including Aƒáif Had≈æiahmetoviƒá, Xhafer Deva, Ferhat Bey Draga and Ahmet Daca) negotiated with representatives of Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá. The negotiations ended with agreement on cooperation in the joint struggle against Communists. Milorad Ekmeƒçiƒá refer to Zvizdiƒá as Muslim Chetnik leader.

The film also has Oviya, Meera Nandan, and Samuthirakani in supporting roles. The film, produced by Raadhika, commenced shoot from May 2014 and released on 20 February 2015. Plot The movie begins with an investigation of a girl who has been dead along with a small vessel. That small vessel is actually a weapon as it contains explosive chemicals (a bomb named \\"Ophalaska\\") with its changing colours. Now comes the quarreling between two gangs, in which one gang is headed by Sarveshwaran (R. Sarathkumar). He lives in Kumbakonam along with his men. Another scene opens in Pollachi, where Surya (R.

When he magnifies that, he sees a Chinese script along with some Tamil words. Sarveshwaran starts talking to the portrait of his mother, who is no longer alive. He then reveals his childhood story. Sarveshwaran is the son of a handicapped woman who is a florist. He sees so many kids wearing wristwatches, buying lollipops, etc. He asks his mother for money so that he can also do the same things as what the kids do regularly. He is the student of a corporation school. He also asks his mother to get him admitted in a government school so that he can learn to speak English. His mother pleads to the principal of the government school to enroll him in that school. The principal denies it, and he accidentally pushes his mother from the balcony, resulting in her death. Sarveshwaran kills the principal the same way the principal killed Sarveshwaran's mother. Now comes the present, in which Sarveshwaran assures his mother that he will earn a lot of money.

He is best known for his works in series that highlight the process and unique labors of everyday society.  Early life and education  Gustave Blache III was born in San Bernardino, California in 1977. In 1983 he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. While in elementary school, Blache was invited to study twice a week at the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA). Drawing pictures of plaster casts and painting copies of Old Masters provided an early understanding of the Old Masters who influence his work today. Blache attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (N.O.C.C.A.), a selective visual and performing arts high school with notable alumni such as jazz musicians Branford, Winton and Jason Marsalis and actor Wendell Pierce. From 1994-1998, he attended the School of Visual Arts in Savannah, Georgia, a satellite campus of New York‚Äôs School of Visual Arts. Upon receiving his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts (Savannah), Blache moved to New York to attend the School of Visual Arts main campus, where he earned an MFA in May 2000.  Career  In Savannah, Blache gained recognition for his life-size figurative paintings. This led to him receiving several commissions, reviews, and a book cover. Savannah author Aberjhani featured Blache‚Äôs painting, The Art Spirit, as the original cover for his book, I Made My Boy Out of Poetry. The Art Spirit paid homage to one of Blache's influences, artist Robert Henri. The painting contains the book written by Robert Henri entitled The Art Spirit in the bottom right corner which is left untethered by a belt that is used to tie other books beneath into a bundle. In 2007, Blache appeared in the documentary film Colored Frames that recounts the influences, inspirations and experiences of African-American artists in the art world over the past 50 years. Colored Frames also featured artists Benny Andrews and Ed Clark along with influential artdealers and scholars June Kelly, Danny Simmons and Mary Schmidt Campbell. Blache‚Äôs painting \\"Between the Head and the Hand\\" was selected for the DVD cover. Gustave Blache III, Self Portrait with Checkered Scarf, 2008, oil on wood, 9.5 x 7.75 inches, National Museum of African American History and Culture, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. Blache's solo exhibition at Cole Pratt Gallery in 2008 entitled, In Shadow, featured ten self-portraits which isolated shadowed sections of his face in an effort to articulate the range of color that the shadow possesses. The George and Leah McKenna Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana acquired two self-portraits from this exhibition, Self- Portrait in Shadow and Self-Portrait Standing at Easel. In 2013 the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture acquired Self Portrait with Checkered Scarf. ‚ÄúThe painting is part of a series created by Blache to study the effects of color, light, and shadow on the human face,‚Äù says NMAAHC Curator, Tuliza Fleming. ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Blache‚Äôs self- portrait helps fulfill our goal of owning and exhibition a stylistically, regionally, and culturally diverse array of contemporary art by African- American artists.‚Äù After featuring the young artists in group exhibitions alongside Edgar Degas, Mary Cassatt, James McNeil Whistler and other heralded 19th Century artists,[3] Island Weiss Gallery in New York hosted the 24 year olds first solo exhibition.[4] That same summer Woodward Gallery‚Äôs Paper 5 exhibition displayed Blache‚Äôs work alongside paintings by Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Jean Michel Basquiat, and other notable Post-War artists.[5] = Visual Journalism = Blache is largely credited for combining traditional painting methods of portraiture with journalism in a brand of art which he affectionately terms, Visual Journalism. His documentary style format uses a series of paintings, dedicated to one subject, to tell the story of an overlooked individual or process. Labor is usually at the center of Blache‚Äôs series‚Äô. His method of work was on display in his 2017 exhibition, A Work in Process, at the Louisiana Arts and Science Museum in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Curator Elizabeth Weinstein assembled over 60 of Blache‚Äôs paintings from public and private collections across the country to showcase all of Blache‚Äôs depiction of laborers. Those series‚Äô included The Curtain Cleaners, The Mop Makers, Leah Chase: Paintings by Gustave Blache III, and Simon Parkes Art Conservation (SPAC). In 2013 the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture acquired Self Portrait with Checkered Scarf.[6] ‚ÄúThe painting is part of a series created by Blache to study the effects of color, light, and shadow on the human face,‚Äù says NMAAHC Curator, Tuliza Fleming. ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Blache‚Äôs self-portrait helps fulfill our goal of owning and exhibition a stylistically, regionally, and culturally diverse array of contemporary art by African-American artists.‚Äù[3] = The Gustave Blache Art Scholarship = In 2018 Gustave established the Gustave Blache Art Scholarship with The School of Visual Arts and the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities. The scholarship covers half the tuition for two students from Louisiana chosen to attend the School of Visual Arts in New York City. The scholarship is an extension of a Blache‚Äôs commitment to community and education. = Leah Chase = Gustave Blache III, Cutting Squash, 2010, oil on wood, 8 x 10.25 inches, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. From April 24, 2012 to September 16, 2012, the New Orleans Museum of Art exhibited Blache's most notable series up to date, Leah Chase: Paintings by Gustave Blache III. The exhibition documented national culinary star chef Leah Chase in the kitchen and the dining room in one of New Orleans‚Äô most famous restaurants, Dooky Chase Restaurant. Gustave Blache III, Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch), 2010, oil on wood, 8.25 x 3.5 inches, National Museum of African American History and Culture, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC Blache was introduced to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. ‚ÄúAsked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. ‚ÄúI told him, ‚ÄòYou could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,‚Äô‚Äù she said. The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. ‚ÄúWe are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,‚Äù National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. ‚ÄúIt is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,‚Äù . . . ‚ÄúBut in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.‚Äù This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache to be included in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Chef Leah Chase (left) and Artist Gustave Blache III (right) standing in front of the painting Stirring Pot (Close Up) from the New Orleans Museum of Art exhibition Leah Chase: Paintings by Gustave Blache III. = Leah Chase: Exhibition Catalogue = The catalogue for the exhibition Leah Chase: Paintings by Gustave Blache III was published by Hudson Hills Press in the Fall of 2012. The foreword to the catalogue was written by Miranda Lash, PhD, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art of the New Orleans Museum of Art. In her comments, Lash likens Blache‚Äôs work to the American realists of the early twentieth century, stating, ‚ÄúAlthough Blache in the past has been called a \\"contemporary impressionist,\\" it might be more accurate to compare his work to that of these American realist painters from the early twentieth century. Henri and Sloan's interest in depicting the labor and beauty of modern life...\\" The introduction to the catalogue was provided by Michael Quick, PhD. Quick writes, \\"Blache's figure painting definitely is painting. I say that because of the freedom of his skillful brushwork, best seen in figures.\\" In addition to cataloging the complete Leah Chase series of paintings, the catalogue also includes several essays, written by A.P. Tureaud, Jr., E. John Bullard, Director Emeritus of the New Orleans Museum of Art, and Richard Anthony Lewis, PhD, Curator of Visual Arts, Louisiana State Museum. These essays offer critical discussion of the Leah Chase Paintings. In his essay, Richard Anthon Lewis, PhD writes, \\"The combination of Blache's artistic style with an established and honored subject in Leah Chase is a contemporary extension of both classical French and American Realism.\\" Lewis‚Äôs statement on style mirror the comments made by Miranda Lash, classifying Blache‚Äôs work in the American Realist style while also concurring with earlier critics regarding the similarities between Blache‚Äôs style and that of the Classical French. John Bullard drew stylistic connections between Blache and French artist √âdouard Vuillard, stating ‚ÄúHis [Blache‚Äôs] paintings, done in small, intimate size and reminiscent of the French artist Edouard Vuillard, are highly detailed and richly colored.\\"  Exhibitions  = Solo exhibitions = 2017- A Work in Process, Survey Exhibition, Louisiana Arts and Science Museum, Baton Rouge, LA * 2012 Leah Chase: Paintings by Gustave Blache III, One-man exhibition, New Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans, LA\\"LEAH CHASE PAINTINGS BY GUSTAVE BLACHE III\\".

He is best known as a member of the bands Pond and Tame Impala, and as the frontman for The Growl.  Early life  Born in East Fremantle, Avery moved around north of Perth for a number of years; living in the town of Broome until the age of 6, when his parents split up. At 7 years old, he temporarily settled in Como, and attended Collier Primary School. He claims he never fit in at school, and \\"wasn't really good at anything besides choir\\". Avery then moved on to live in his grandmother's house in Leeming with his mother, and brother Eliott. From an early age, Avery aspired to be a professional Australian rules footballer and play for the West Coast Eagles in the AFL. He began playing guitar aged sixteen and writing songs at seventeen; and as a child occasionally played piano. In his youth, Avery listened extensively to gospel, blues and soul music, particularly musicians Skip James and Son House.  Career  Avery initially started off as a member in the band, Red Shoes Boy, and played drums for singer Abbe May, but gradually moved off to form The Growl. From guidance off a friend, he eventually bonded with Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker, and moved in with him. He would then become a part of the Perth music scene; becoming a founding member of Pond, alongside Jay Watson, Jamie Terry and Joe Ryan. Avery would then go on to live with fellow band member and friend Nick Allbrook and create the duo Allbrook/Avery. As well as playing in Allbrook/Avery and Pond, Avery formed and fronted Fremantle based garage rock band, The Growl, recruiting fellow musicians Clinton Oliver, Marc Earley, Michael Jelinek, Samuel Kuzich and James Ireland. They released their Clever Lever EP in 2011, with their debut What Would Christ Do?? released shortly after in 2013. They also supported Tame Impala around America in 2012 and 2013 and supported English musician Jake Bugg in 2014. In May 2013, it was revealed that Allbrook would leave Tame Impala to pursue other projects. Following the departure, it was confirmed that Avery would replace Allbrook, ultimately becoming a part of the band's new line up. Not long after joining Tame Impala, he and Parker founded the psychedelic funk band, AAA Aardvark Getdown Services (originally named Kevin Spacey). The formation came about as a fundraiser for another Perth based musician and friend, Felicity Groom, who, whilst heavily pregnant had her car stolen. Avery was featured on bass, along with Parker on drums and fellow musician Cam Parkin on keys. On 21 December 2013, they played a second set under the name The Golden Triangle Municipal Funk Band, with Ben Whitt (former frontman of The Chemist) on guitar and vocals, Avery on bass and Parker on drums. On 22 February 2014 it was announced that AAA Aardvark Getdown Services would play a gig alongside Pond, Peter Bibby, The Silents and Felicity Groom, organised by Fremantle-based record label, Spinning Top. In 2012 it was revealed that Avery and Allbrook had collaborated with London- based shoegaze band, The Horrors, to record new material for Allbrook/Avery (following their debut Big 'Art, released in 2011). They recorded two LP's in a basement in London with four-fifths of The Horrors' line up. The first record released will be Sunroom, following that will be Wedding Songs. The bands initially came into contact when Allbrook/Avery supported The Horrors on their Australian tour in Laneway 2012. Other musicians such as Jerome Watson from The History of Apple Pie, Holly Warren from Novella and Jason Holt from Spectrum contributed to the record. There is currently no release date. Pond's sixth album, Man It Feels Like Space Again, was released in January 2015. The record was mixed by Kevin Parker in his Perth studio. Avery spent the majority of 2016 touring with The Last Shadow Puppets on their Everything You've Come To Expect tour. After contributing backing vocals to Arctic Monkeys' 2018 album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, Avery joined them on tour as both supporting act and multi-instrumentalist in the band's newly-expanded live line-up. = Solo work = On 10 March 2017, Avery released a solo album entitled Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams. On announcing the album Avery stated \\"I wanted to make something that sounded like the old records I love‚ÄîJohnny Hartman, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Sarah Vaughan, Etta James‚Äîthe big band stuff with less metaphorical lyrics.\\" Pitchfork reviewed the album and stated \\"Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams is a focused record with several wonderful songs. It's not novel, nor does it attempt to be, just like those old 45s it so fondly recalls.\\" The Skinny stated the album is \\"blatantly wearing its influences on its sleeve but heartfelt as all hell.\\" Vendor Culture stated that Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams is \\"an album that's searingly candid but a gritty, cinematic dream nonetheless.\\" Personal life In 2018, Avery married model Alyssa Miller. On 29 November 2018 Miller confirmed via her Instagram account the couple had separated.

Waissel was from 1573 headmaster of a school at Schippenbeil near K√∂nigsberg; he published in that year a volume of lute arrangements of vocal pieces, and in 1592 he issued a collection of German dances for lute, which signaled the decline of German lute tablature as it yielded prominence to the so-called French system. Waissel's output comprises three books of solo lute music in all, and one collection of duets. It is unlikely though that any of the pieces in these collections are his own compositions. Waissel's chief importance arguably lies in his expansion of the passamezzo/saltarello pairing into full suites that in form, if not title, comprise some of the earliest true dance suites. Besides his publications of lute tabulatures, he also published a collection of biblical tales in 1596, and a chronicle of East Prussia in 1599. His son, also named Matth√§us, became a musician too. In 1598 he was instrumentalist at Riga, and from 1616 to 1619 he was a member of the K√∂nigsberg court chapel.

The statute was intended to promote greater uniformity in certain areas of federal jurisdiction and relieve the pressure on the dockets of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals for the regional circuits.History of the Federal Judiciary, Landmark Judicial Legislation. History In 1971, a committee appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger proposed the creation a National Court of Appeals that would decide cases and screen petitions for appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The 1975 report of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System proposed a like-named court that would determine national law and resolve inter-circuit conflicts by deciding certain categories of cases referred to it by the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. Congress rejected both proposals for a national court of appeals, but the studies drew attention to the problems associated with the lack of uniform rulings in specialized areas of jurisdiction. A proposal drafted by the Department of Justice led President Jimmy Carter to request in 1979 that Congress establish a court of appeals for a Federal Circuit, to be on the same jurisdictional level as the other U.S. courts of appeals. The proposed court would combine the functions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals with those of the U.S. Court of Claims, and the president also urged Congress to consider vesting the proposed court with the jurisdiction to promote uniformity and predictability in federal tax cases. The House and Senate failed to complete consideration of the bill before the end of Carter's term. The legislation was reintroduced in 1981, based on an endorsement by the Judicial Conference of the United States and support from business leaders. Effect The act established the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which became the only U.S. court of appeals defined exclusively by its jurisdiction rather than geographical boundaries. This new court assumed the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Claims. The new court was authorized to hear appeals from several federal administrative boards as well. Congress abolished the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the U.S. Court of Claims, reassigning the twelve judges of those courts to serve on the Federal Circuit court. The act of 1982 also established a U.S. Claims Court (now the U.S. Court of Federal Claims), and reassigned the sitting trial judges of the U.S. Court of Claims to the new claims court. Congress extended the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit to the review of appeals from the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Merit Systems Protection Board, the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals, and certain administrative decisions of the secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce, as well as all appeals related to patents. Congress rejected the controversial proposals to grant the Federal Circuit court jurisdiction over appeals of tax and environmental cases. References Further readingEllen E. Sward & Rodney F.

The route is long and runs east‚Äìwest through Viken and Vestland counties over the vast Hardangervidda plateau. The road begins at the European route E16 highway just south of Heradsbygda in Ringerike municipality and runs through the Sogna river valley to the village of Sokna (this part is called the Soknedalsveien). It then continues further on to Hamremoen and up along the east side of the lake Kr√∏deren to Gulsvik where it crosses the river and then follows the Hallingdalen valley through Fl√•, Nesbyen, Gol, Torpo, √Öl, Hol, and Geilo (this part is called the Hallingdalsveien). From there, the road begins its path across the Hardangervidda plateau via Ustaoset and Haugast√∏l, passing the V√∏ringsfossen waterfall while descending down into the M√•b√∏dalen valley in Eidfjord. The road follows the Eid Fjord for a ways before crossing the fjord via the Hardanger Bridge (opened in 2013 - there was a ferry here prior to that time). The road continues through the Vallavik Tunnel before reaching its terminus at the village of Granvin in Voss Municipality. The portion of the road from Haugest√∏l to Eidfjord (over the Hardangervidda plateau) is designated a National Tourist Route. Improvements In June 2014, a long stretch of new road was opened in Ringerike-Krodsherad. Compared to the old road, it includes some long tunnels, is less curvaceous, and shortens the journey between Sokna to √òrgenvika. The Hardanger Bridge (opened in 2013) also shortened the travel time, making road 7 the clearly fastest option for travelling Oslo‚ÄìBergen by road. There are also some unofficial proposals to build a long tunnel under the Hardangervidda plateau, because this stretch is often closed due to snow storms in the winter.

He has degrees in physics and theoretical physics from London University and Imperial College of Science and Technology, and in computer science from the University of Cambridge, where he did his postgraduate research in the resolution of time-based three-dimensional matrices of second-order partial differential equation sets. Whilst still at university, he had also performed early work for British Steel in the use of very high frequency oscillators in the measurement of surface roughness in a continuous strip steel rolling mill in order to enable high quality enameling. He is an Associate of the Royal College of Science. He joined International Computers Limited in 1968 and became Head of Software Engineering.In 1977 he joined Bell-Northern Research in Ottawa and Palo Alto California and became Director of Advanced Development. In 1981 he joined the ranks of the early-80s hitech entrepreneurs and became the co-founder and President of Orcatech, one of the world's first intelligent graphics workstation companies. He went on to become the founding Chief Executive of the Strathclyde Institute in Glasgow, Scotland, Senior Director of Scottish Enterprise and Chief Executive for the economic development agency for Norfolk and Waveney. Before moving back to Canada, he spent three years as Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Industrial Society, later to become the Work Foundation think tank. He has Canadian and British citizenships. ICL CADES Pearson started his career at International Computers Limited. He was involved in the early development work of the VME/B operating system for ICL‚Äôs 2900 Series.

Bell-Northern Research Laboratories At the end of 1977, Pearson moved to Bell-Northern Research Laboratories in Ottawa, Canada, and became Director of the laboratory's Advanced Development teams in Palo Alto, Raleigh NC and Ottawa. Whilst at BNR his primary focus was on leading research programmes working on heuristic design and development technologies for Northern Telecom digital communications products.D.J.Pearson \\"The use and abuse of a software engineering system\\" National Computer Conference 1979Don Leavitt \\"Development method review held useful\\" Computerworld June 1979A.Bobas and J.Valahora \\"A design automation system for printed circuit board assemblies\\" Proceedings of the 14th Design Automation Conference, 1977 His key research programmes included artificial intelligence techniques applied to dense electronic designs, a virtual graphics machine global standard, software engineering techniques for high-performance Digital Multiplex System products, and computer-aided design strategies for locally intelligent products. During this time he was a science and technology adviser to the Canadian government and served as a member of the Science and Engineering Research Council for Canada. Orcatech Inc In 1981, with a small number of BNR colleagues, Pearson left to found Orcatech Inc., one of the first companies specialising in the design and development of raster-based high resolution intelligent graphics workstations for the computer-aided engineering market.David Thomas \\"Knights of the New Technology: The Inside Story of Canada's Computer Elite\\" Longmans 1983 In the early 1980s, the availability of bit-slice and 16-bit microprocessors started to revolutionise personal computing and high resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation or PC rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers. Pearson and his colleagues recognized the opportunity these microprocessors offered to graphics technology over the old technologies of storage tube and refresh vector graphics arrangements. Orcatech was at the leading edge of what is now recognized as modern high resolution computer graphics. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector and included General Motors, Nortel, Boeing and Lockheed as clients. After developing a portfolio of successful workstation products and a rich portfolio of blue-chip clients, Orcatech went public, 20 months after its formation, on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1983 at a valuation of over $100m, at that time one of the highest valued young technology companies ever to go public on the TSX. The Strathclyde Institute In 1986 Pearson moved back to the UK to become the first Chief Executive of the Strathclyde Institute, a research and consultancy company focusing on computer-based manufacturing systems and based in Glasgow, Scotland.\\"CIM Institute at Strathclyde\\" Electronics and Power, Vol 33 Issue 5 May 1987\\"Institute for Computer Integrated Manufacture\\" University of Strathclyde Archives 2012 In establishing the Institute, Pearson's partners were the University of Strathclyde, under its charismatic and supportive Principal, Sir Graham Hills, the Scottish Development Agency, Hewlett Packard, Group Bull and Honeywell. During his six years as Chief Executive, the Institute advised some of the world‚Äôs leading companies in the computer-based production of computers, jet engine manufacture, automotive assembly, food and beverage processing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. He was also the author of one of the definitive guides to Computer Integrated Manufacturing, published by the Financial Times.David Pearson \\"Computer Integrated Manufacturing for the Engineering Industry\\" Financial Times Business Information Books Ltd., 1990 Concurrently, Pearson was also Professor in Management at Strathclyde University in Glasgow and a government adviser on company startup policy, seed funding and operations. Economic development In 1993 Pearson became Senior Director of Scottish Enterprise, the national body responsible for the economic development of Scotland, where he introduced and developed its focus on new business startups. After three years with Scottish Enterprise, Pearson took over as Chief Executive of the failing Norfolk and Waveney Enterprise Partnership, the economic development agency for East Anglia, which was successfully turned around and transformed.A.Newmann \\"Business United: A profile of David Pearson\\" Business Plus, April 1997 Pearson also served as a member of the University of East Anglia Senate during this period. At the beginning of 2000, he was appointed Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Industrial Society, one of the world's oldest and most respected economic think tanks, later to become The Work Foundation, where he advised the private and public sectors on corporate governance, compliance, growth and employment futures. Whilst in London he was a frequent figure at the Royal Automobile Club on Pall Mall, where he stayed, dined and entertained clients. He retired in February 2003, after restructuring the organization, selling loss-making activities and adding 23 million pounds to the balance sheet.George Trefgarne \\"Work Foundation Chief Quits\\" Daily Telegraph 18 February 2003 On retiring from the Work Foundation, he moved to Pender Harbour, British Columbia, Canada, where he served the local boating community as Canadian Power and Sail Squadron Training Officer and Squadron Commander for a number of years.

In the 1950s-1960s, Hudson went to skid row, to convince men to volunteer for his study. More than 1,200 men were promised a clean bed, three free square meals a day and free medical care if they were found to have prostate cancer. Hudson's early experience with seeing patients dying at a tuberculosis hospital he was working at led him to develop an interest in prostate cancer. His discovery about the lack of information regarding treatment for the disease and medical training for rectal exams needed to diagnose the disease drove him to pursue research in prostate cancer. At the beginning of the experiment, Hudson and his colleague selected 141 patients having symptoms and signs for urinary obstruction. However, as the experiment progressed, patients were selected randomly. They were not informed that the biopsies searching for cancer had possible side effects, i.e., rectal tearing and impotence. According to Robert Aronowitz, before the biopsy, the patients underwent a physical examination including blood and urine assays, x-rays of the abdomen, massage of the prostate for cytology and intravenous pyelograms. For the biopsy, a part of the prostate measuring 2.5 √ó 1.0 √ó 0.5 centimeters was removed; one half was sent to a pathology laboratory to get tested while the other half was retained for permanent preparation. If the results showed cancer, a perineal prostatectomy and orchiectomy was performed on the men, followed by diethylstilbestrol treatment. The homeless were targeted for these biopsies because they were painful and untested, and less vulnerable populations would not volunteer.  Background  Before securing a lead research position at Columbia University, Hudson received surgical training in the United States Navy and obtained a research position in urology at Johns Hopkins University under William Scott. Over time, Hudson's desire to learn more about prostate cancer led him to pursue a research position at Columbia University; where he led various research projects and was given ownership of various labs. In addition to his academic accomplishments, Hudson was appointed head of urology at Francis Delafield Hospital. Hudson's intent with the Skid Row cancer experiment was to figure out whether or not prostate cancer was terminal and how soon it could be diagnosed. He continued working in the urological field after leaving Columbia and also became involved in \\"tobacco research, laboratory science‚Ä¶[and] other major preventative research.\\" In addition, the efficacy of Hudson's treatment for what he deemed \\"early\\" cancers using methods such as radical surgery, castration, and diethylstilbestrol therapy was still unknown at that time. However, despite this, Hudson's studies were still cited in many urological journals and textbooks in the late 1950s and 60s as a new way to inspect the prostate. Only in a comment by the National Institutes of Health in a response to one of Hudson's requests for funding do they consider malpractice, asking for documentation of his compliance Public Health Service policy. Hudson has practiced in South Pasadena, Florida, Columbia University, New York City, and the Francis Delafield Hospital, in New York City. Hudson died in 2017 at age 99.  Consequences  The ultimate goal of Hudson's research included finding a viable way to use open perineal biopsy (OPB) to diagnose prostate cancer at an early stage. He wanted to see the biological history of the disease and prove that the best way to treat it was to attack any signs of the cancer before it became a serious issue. However, the Bowery Series lacked a control group of patients who were not biopsied, so he was unable to compare data with his experimentation group. He lacked any proof or evidence that the people treated were able to live longer, and were actually subjected to further health risks. Thus, the Bowery Series yielded little effective data, and the patients suffered from side effects of the OPB. Although he was unable to accomplish his goals, Hudson set the precedent for future studies in a push for the screen-and-treat movement. Before the Bowery Series, prostate cancer could only be detected at its latest stages when it was already too late to save the patient's life. However, recent advancements have enabled medical professionals to diagnose the cancer in earlier stages. Over the course of a decade starting in 1951, Hudson recruited over 1200 subjects from the Bowery flophouses in the \\"Skid Row\\" of New York. Many of the recruits were 'down and out' men who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness. To motivate enrollment into the study food, bedding, and medical care were offered but the risks involved with the open perineal biopsy procedures were not fully explained to the patients, and many of them suffered long term health consequences. Hudson claimed that the procedure, involving excising a 2.5x1x.5 cm core of posterior prostate caused no harm, however an independent research team proved otherwise, reporting post-op incidence of impotence, rectal laceration, and a diminishing sexual function in 24 patients. The assertion that the biopsies caused no harm was again refuted in an interview by one of his residents who claimed that impotence was a common result. The results of the study were published periodically as case series. In the preliminary case series, the symptoms of a 100-person cohort that tested positive for cancer was described. Hudson implemented radical treatments to this cohort that were ambitiously beyond the standard of care with little scientific backing of efficacy. In addition to the surgical castration of these 100 men, he treated them with estrogen hormone therapy, which was later proven to be ineffective and detrimental. The hormone therapy put the patients at risk for heart disease and stroke and caused a loss in muscle tone and overall stamina. In a summarizing study, Hudson reported that out of 686 patients tested, the mortality rate for men with negative biopsies was 20% and the mortality rate for men with positive biopsies followed by rigorous treatment was 30%. Hudson did not publish results for a control group or a group with biopsies done without hormone treatment so the value of these results are unclear. Ethics The ethical integrity of the tactics that Hudson used to recruit volunteers for his experiment has been questioned. Some of his methods exploited the fact that his volunteers were mostly homeless men. For example, Hudson would offer his volunteers compensation in the form of meal tickets and temporary shelter in a hospital room. Then, in order to ensure participation, authorities would only present the meal ticket to a volunteer once he showed up for the study. Because they were homeless, the volunteers saw these rewards as very attractive. Additionally, their lack of education made it more likely for the Bowery men to volunteer for Hudson's experiments, as they could not fully understand what they were signing up for. In particular, at the time of the experiment, the method of open perineal biopsy was new and largely untested, and it would have been unlikely for someone to voluntarily undergo the procedure. Moreover, the volunteers were very ill-informed. They were not provided with clearly written papers about the dangers of the biopsies, such as rectal tearing. Even though the perineal biopsy approach seemed to have its benefits, its potential risk for rectal perforation was quite high. In an interview, Hudson defended his experiment's ethics. He said he felt no regret, saying the volunteers seemed to him to be fully aware of the aspects involved in the study. Also, they did not receive any monetary incentives from him to participate, which, otherwise, he thought, would \\"constitute coercion\\". Once becoming aware of Hudson's practices, an editor of the journal Cancer wrote him a letter asking what protection he had from the university's legal department. Hudson subsequently stopped publishing the results of his research.

California Bar Admission On September 4, 2013, the Supreme Court of California heard oral argument on the In re Garcia admission matter. During arguments on the matter, it became apparent that the court would be unable to grant Garcia's petition for bar admission unless legislative action allowed them to do so. Justice Marvin R. Baxter asked why nobody had reached out to the California State Legislature, noting, \\"I would imagine there would be a great deal of support for something like this.\\" Garcia then began lobbying members of the legislature until a bill was finally introduced recommending applicants be allowed to practice law if they have met all other bar requirements in spite of having been brought into the country unlawfully by their parents. The court testified in a hearing of the legislature recommending that immigrants who were brought here illegally as minors should be allowed to obtain law licenses, and the legislature passed said legislation just three days later. Governor Jerry Brown signed the legislation on October 5, 2013, and the bill went into effect January 1, 2014. In a January 2, 2014, by unanimous decision consistent with the new legislation, the court instructed the State Bar, an arm of the court, to admit Garcia, rejecting arguments of the United States Department of Justice and others that federal law precluded his admission due to his undocumented status. According to the court's decision, section 1621 of Title 8 of the United States Code \\"generally restricts an undocumented immigrant's eligibility to obtain a professional license, but that also contains a subsection expressly authorizing a state to render an undocumented immigrant eligible to obtain such a professional license through the enactment of a state law meeting specified requirements.\\" After Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill No. 1159 on September 28, 2014, requiring \\"all 40 licensing boards under the California Department of Consumer Affairs to consider applicants regardless of immigration status by 2016,\\" Garcia was cited as being part of the inspiration for the bill.  Early life  Garcia was born in Michoac√°n, Mexico, to parents Salvador Covarrubias and Albertina Garcia, who brought him to the United States illegally at 17 months of age. When he was nine years old, Garcia's family moved from the United States back to Mexico, with him in tow. When he was 17, Garcia's father moved his family again, bringing Garcia into the United States illegally a second time, where he has remained ever since. Garcia applied for legal residency on November 18, 1994, but his application remained pending for nearly 19 years. Garcia is the second-oldest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters.  Education  Garcia graduated from Durham High School (California) before going on to obtain an AA in Social and Behavioral Sciences and an AS in Business Administration from Butte College; and completing the Paralegal Certificate Program from California State University, Chico. On May 9, 2009 after years of attending law school at night so he could work during the day, Garcia received a Juris Doctorate from Cal Northern School of Law. In July of that same year, Garcia passed the California Bar Exam on his first attempt.  Career  = Litigation attorney = After learning the Supreme Court of California ruled he could be a lawyer, Garcia told the New York Times, \\"I can open my own law firm, and that's exactly what I intend to do.\\" On February 3, 2014, Garcia opened The Law Offices of Sergio C. Garcia headquartered in Chico, California. Garcia announced, via Facebook, his intention to open a second law office in Los Angeles in June 2014. = Lecturer, motivational speaker, guest appearances = As an inspirational speaker and nationally recognized lawyer, Garcia has delivered many keynote addresses and lectures, and participated in panels at venues including Sierra College, the Bickel & Brewer Latino Institute for Human Rights at New York University School of Law, La Raza Centro Legal's 41st Anniversary Celebration, and Napa Valley College's fourth annual Dreamer's Conference. In early 2014, Saint Mary's Hall, a private college preparatory school in San Antonio, Texas, invited Garcia to be a speaker at their model United Nations conference. However, the school rescinded the invitation to Garcia when he refused to certify that he was a citizen by signing a W-9 form. Before the incident, Saint Mary's Hall had described Garcia as an \\"experienced and exciting keynote speaker\\", as well as expressing how unfortunate that he had been waiting for a visa for 19 years. Garcia has a national segment on MundoFox every Friday. On June 10, 2014, TED published a Garcia talk called \\"Fighting for Justice, Changing Lives: Sergio Garcia at TEDxBoyleHeights.\\" On March 28, 2015, Garcia was the guest speaker at the Tehama County Democratic Dinner, where he told attendees, \\"I would not be here without the many good Democrats of California, and they are my family.\\" Garcia was scheduled to be awarded the 2015 Phillip Burton Immigration and Civil Rights Award on May 28, 2015. = Author = In 2006, Garcia published a self-help book on romance called Love, Sex and Romance, the proceeds from which he used to pay his law school tuition. Following his August 2012 appearance at a press conference and guest of honor at California's Capitol Hill, Garcia authored \\"So√±ando de Este a Oeste...,\\" an essay appearing in Spanish on Huffington Post. Garcia coauthored an article appearing in the February 2013 issue of Los Angeles Lawyer titled \\"Waiting to Become an Attorney after Passing the Bar\\", encouraging young attorneys to learn how to assist undocumented youths under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which would protect undocumented youth from deportation while providing them with a work permit. \\"One way is to become trained to help applicants to apply for deferred action so that they may obtain some interim status in the United States,\\" wrote Garcia and coauthor. = Sergio C. Garcia Foundation = Along with money he raises through fundraising, Garcia shares his speaking engagement fees with students struggling financially through scholarships granted by the Sergio C. Garcia Foundation. As of March 18, 2014, the foundation had raised $55,000.  References  External links In re Sergio C. Garcia on Admission - S202512.

The ECOESC service region consists of Tuscarawas (567.58 sq mi), Carroll (394.67 sq mi), Harrison (403.53 sq mi) and Belmont (537.35 sq mi) Counties. This is over 1,900 square miles, making the ECOESC service regions one of the largest in the state. The ESC serves eight local school districts, four exempted village school districts, six city school districts, two vocational career centers, and two Board of DDs serving 28,085 students and 2,054 teachers across its service area. The Ohio General Assembly created educational service centers in 1914 as county boards of education. State law changed boards of education to educational service centers in 1995. The East Central Ohio ESC is directed by a governing board elected by the voters of the eight local school districts served by the ESC. Since educational service centers have no legal taxing or bonding authority, they must depend on revenues from member districts, from the state as prescribed in law, through contracted services to districts, and from competition for grants and state funding. State funding to ESCs consists of two major categories: unit funding for gifted and preschool handicapped units and a per pupil allocation.

Bristol Revunions, or more commonly Revunions, is a sketch comedy society formed by students at the University of Bristol. Founded in the early 1950s, the group has produced many well-known alumni and continues to write and perform sketch material both within Bristol and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. History The earliest reference to Revunions dates back to 2 July 1953, although it is likely that the society existed before this date, making it the oldest performing arts society within the University of Bristol. Originally a dramatic society that performed a comedy revue on an annual basis, Revunions moved closer to its present-day status as a sketch comedy society within its first thirty years of existence. This progress was abruptly halted in the mid-1980s when the group faced bankruptcy, following the speculative disappearance of its treasurer to Paraguay along with the society's funds. As a result, the society entered a hiatus that was not ended until 2008, when the group was resurrected. Since then, the group has taken a series of shows to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and performs its material throughout the greater Bristol area, often performing with the sister society Bristol Improv. =Somewhat Notable Alumni=David Bamber *Robert Carsen *Allan Corduner *Sue Jones-Davies *Jamie Demetriou *Natasia Demetriou *Greg Doran *Nicholas Farrell *Linda Gillard *Julia Hills *Chris Langham *Norman Lloyd-Edwards *Charlotte Ritchie *Mat Ewins *Colin Sell *Alastair Stewart OBE *Ellie White *Kathryn Wolfe Structure Revunions is run by an annually-elected committee, led by a President.

It is available on all Mexican cable and satellite systems, as well as over-the- air in Mexico City on digital television station XHHCU-TDT channel 45. Created in 1998 under the LVII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, the Canal del Congreso broadcasts its congressional programming as well as other politically-oriented programs. It has studio facilities in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and it is governed by a bicameral commission (Spanish: Comisi√≥n Bicameral del Canal de Television del Congreso de la Uni√≥n). In 2000, it began full-time transmissions on cable systems, expanding to satellite in 2001. At the beginning of the LVIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, the Bicameral Commission worked to achieve a milestone for the channel: the Comisi√≥n Federal de Telecomunicaciones, then the television regulator in the country, required all cable systems to carry it. On March 10, 2010, Cofetel awarded it a concession to start XHHCU-TDT, a digital-only station broadcasting from Cerro del Chiquihuite, to carry the Canal del Congreso signal over the air in Mexico City. Channel 45 went on air on June 24, 2010. In 2013, the channel's director general, Leticia Salas Torres, stated that she wishes to expand Canal del Congreso's over-the-air reach outside Mexico City.\\"El Canal del Congreso busca transmisi√≥n abierta,\\" Notimex, 24 March 2013: The first step in this process was Canal del Congreso's addition to ten transmitters of the Sistema P√∫blico de Radiodifusi√≥n del Estado Mexicano (SPR) in 2016.

In 1996, Publicover designed the first trampoline safety net enclosure to become commercially successful. These enclosures protect trampoliners from falling off the trampoline. Childhood Publicover is a fourth-generation inventor and entrepreneur born in 1958 in Los Gatos, California. He went to school in San Jose, California, where he graduated from Blackford High School in 1977. Education and early career Publicover attended the University of California at Davis where he majored in Economics. He married Valerie A. DePiazza in August 1984. In April 1988, he founded American Builders & Craftsman Inc., a professional homebuilding and commercial construction firm in Saratoga, California. Inventor In 1995 Publicover's children, along with friends, were jumping on his trampoline when a young neighbor fell off, hurting herself. After that he began building prototypes of his enclosure design. Publicover went on to design and patent a trampoline enclosure that is sold as standard equipment with millions of trampolines each year. By July 1997, Publicover's family-run company, JumpSport, had Hedstrom of Bedford, Pennsylvania, manufacturing their trampoline enclosures, but few sales were achieved during the winter holiday season. This was attributed to the enclosure costing slightly more than the trampoline together with the lack of retail distribution. After burning through most of their assets and remortgaging their home, they decided to make one final effort by attending the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association Super Show in Atlanta and taking out a full-page ad in Disney Magazine. At the Super Show, Costco agreed to test the product in 22 stores, where the product sold well. Costco took the product into all of its stores nationwide. Soon after JumpSport expanded to other retailers. In 1998 Publicover developed two more trampoline safety inventions. After Publicover suffered a minor leg break while testing another manufacturer's trampoline with his kids, he focused on improving the shock-absorption characteristics of the trampoline bed, patenting the StageBounce and DoubleBounce systems. Between 1998 and 2000 his company introduced four trampolines based on these safety features. In 2000, Publicover raised capital from Silicon Valley's Band of Angels. As of May 2014, Publicover has been granted 24 patents. He also has more published patent filings, some of which were still being prosecuted. Patent litigation Publicover initially sold 200 units to Sam's Club for a market test. The sales led to a verbal order for 6,000 units that fell through. Instead, Sam's Club switched to selling competitor Jump King trampoline enclosures that were later deemed unsafe by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2005. Publicover says that more low-quality knock-offs quickly flooded the market. In 2001 Publicover sued Wal-Mart, Hedstrom, Jump King, and several other infringing companies. Publicover ended up winning a seven-figure settlement from Hedstrom and JumpKing and while Wal-Mart was not found liable, they were banned from selling the copycat products. In 2007, JumpSport's 15-employee business had $13 million in sales and in 2008 Publicover claimed over $50 million of lost sales due to patent infringement. Legacy From 1998 to 2006, enclosures gained broad acceptance in the marketplace and were being sold together with more than 80% of all trampolines. In that same period, U.S. sales of trampolines doubled from around 550,000 to 1,200,000 while total annual reported trampoline injuries began to decline. Personal life As of 2014, Publicover lives in Saratoga, California, with his wife, Valerie DePiazza Publicover. They have one son and two daughters.

The song was written by Ray Davies. Lyrics In \\"Two Sisters\\", the singer compares sisters Sybilla and Priscilla. Sybilla is a swinging, single \\"wayward lass\\", while Priscilla is a married housewife. Priscilla is tired of facing \\"the drudgery of being wed\\", with her being said to be \\"so jealous of her sister.\\" The singer compares how \\"Sybilla looked into her mirror; Priscilla looked into the washing machine\\" and how \\"Sybilla looked into the wardrobe; Priscilla looked into the frying pan.\\" Priscilla then \\"threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again [and threw away] her women's weekly magazines just to be free again and put the children in the nursery just to be free again.\\" However, upon seeing her children, she \\"decided she was better off\\" than her wild sister. She's \\"no longer jealous of her sister.\\" The two characters in the lyrics of \\"Two Sisters\\" (Sybilla and Priscilla) were inspired by Ray Davies and his brother, Dave Davies. Ray was more introverted (and was the only one of the two married) while Dave was a party animal who was very outgoing. This clash of personalities was often the cause of many band in-fights, which would come out in their songs (ex. \\"Dandy\\", which is often thought to be about Dave). Music \\"Two Sisters\\", sung by Ray Davies, is notable for its use of harpsichord (which was also used in the song \\"Village Green\\", a song recorded around the same time, but saved for The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society). It was also the first time strings were used in a Kinks track. Release and reception \\"Two Sisters\\" saw release in May 1967, on both the French EP, \\"Mister Pleasant\\", and as the American B-side of \\"Waterloo Sunset\\". Later that year, it appeared on the album Something Else by the Kinks. The track has since appeared on Picture Book. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the track was \\"allegorical\\" and a \\"stunner\\". Although never a regular part of their live set, the group did perform the song (live vocals over backing track) on the BBC2 TV show Colour Me Pop in July 1968.

In 1914 she began to exhibit in the annual Spring Exhibition at the Association and continued to paint throughout the war. She was a member of the Beaver Hall Group. She exhibited regularly with the group and in 1926 the National Gallery of Canada purchased one of her works. She joined the Canadian Group of Painters in 1939 and was a member of the Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal. Her work was exhibited in the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, Wembley, England in 1924 and 1925, at the 1939 New York World's Fair and at the 400th Anniversary Exhibition in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1954.

It is also a parish church of the Diocese of Steubenville. History The first Mass celebrated in what is now Marietta was celebrated by the Rev. Joseph de Bonnecamp, S.J. who was the chaplain to a French expedition from Quebec. The Mass was celebrated at the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio Rivers. There were few Catholics in the early years of the town. By the 1830s a priest would occasionally visit from Wheeling. Bishop John B. Purcell of the Diocese of Cincinnati bought land in Marietta in 1837 and sent a resident priest the following year to establish the parish. A building on the property was used by the parish for worship until 1853 when the first church building was built. The building was inundated by floods in 1884, 1891, 1895 and 1898. The property for the present church was acquired in 1900 after the 1,000-member parish determined it needed to move to higher ground. The house on the site was moved to the north side of the property and is still in use as the rectory. Cleveland architect Emile M. Uhlrich designed the church in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The ground was broken on July 1, 1903 and Bishop James J. Hartley of the Diocese of Columbus, which St. Mary's became a part of in 1868, laid the cornerstone on June 12, 1904. The building was enclosed in 1905 and work halted until 1907 while subscriptions were paid off and new funds were raised. The church was consecrated by Bishop Hartley on December 12, 1909. The stained glass windows were created in Munich, Germany. In 1945 St. Mary's transferred to the newly established Diocese of Steubenville. Pope Francis decreed on June 13, 2013 that St. Mary's Church was elevated to the status of a minor basilica. It was solemnized by Bishop Jeffrey M. Monforton on November 5, 2013.

There are several versions of the story, as is the case with most lost mine legends; perhaps the best known is the one with Tom Schofield, a railroad worker, decided to do some prospecting in his time off. According to this version, while prospecting in the Clipper Mountains, northwest of Essex (in San Bernardino county), he found an old stone house. As the house appeared to be long abandoned, he continued on. Several miles further in his travels he found a spring. Near the spring he spotted an old trail. Following the trail, it led him up over a hill where he spotted a huge boulder that was split in two. The path went through this split boulder, and into what he believed was an ancient Spanish camp. While looking through the deserted camp, he found pieces of ore and an old rusted Dutch oven, the latter of which he tripped over in his search. As he tripped, he caused the Dutch oven to tip, spilling out handfuls of gold nuggets. Schofield filled his pockets with as much gold as he could carry and went back to \\"civilization\\" where he celebrated his good fortune in the old-fashioned way. The upshot of the story is, Schofield, on having celebrated up all of his gold, returned to the Clipper mountains to get more gold and could not find the mine again. He could not even find the trail.

He was then drafted third overall by the Toronto Argonauts and signed with the team on May 27, 2014. He played Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) football with the Manitoba Bisons.  Professional career  = Toronto Argonauts = In his first three seasons, Coombs was mostly used as a backup or rotational player behind starting tailback Curtis Steele and later Brandon Whitaker. In Coombs' fourth season in the league, and first under new head coach Marc Trestman, his role in the offense expanded greatly; averaging 5.2 receptions per game. On August 22, mid-way through the season, it was announced that Coombs would have to undergo shoulder surgery. At the time, Trestman said he was hopeful Coombs could return to action before the end of the season. Indeed he did, as he played in the last game of the regular season on November 4, 2017, recording two catches for 31 yards. In the East Final against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Coombs had a team-leading nine receptions for 77 yards and one carry for three yards. He dressed in the 105th Grey Cup game, but did not record any stats as his team went on to win the Grey Cup championship over the Calgary Stampeders. Coombs began the 2018 Toronto Argonauts season on the one- game injured list before being transferred to the six-game injured list as he recovered from an ankle injury. Coombs played in only two games in 2018 as he struggled to stay healthy. Following the season, he was re-signed by the Argos to a one-year contract.

The film consists of closeup interviews with soldiers in a platoon stationed at outpost Restrepo, during and after their deployment. Most of the reviews of the documentary have been favorable. Background The documentary uses film footage shot between 2007 and 2008 by photojournalist Tim Hetherington, who died in 2011 while reporting on the Libyan Civil War. Hetherington spent approximately 10 months with 'Battle' Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, U.S. Army at Restrepo outpost. The 2010 documentary Restrepo was nominated for an Academy Award. After the documentary Restrepo was made, there was still a considerable amount of film left over. About a year later Sebastian Junger started to work on Korengal, but it was difficult to do without Hetherington. Junger's aim was to create a follow-up documentary that delved deeper into the individual soldier's experiences and emotions of combat. It is intended to differ from its predecessor, Restrepo‚Äîwhich was intended to make the viewer feel what it was like to be in combat‚Äîby deconstructing what war does to the individual soldier. Junger wanted to express the complexity of the experiences of combat for soldiers: Plot The documentary takes place between 2007 and 2008 in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. The film consists mainly of interviews with men in a platoon stationed at outpost Restrepo. Forty-two soldiers died in Korengal Valley before the United States pulled out in April 2010. Unlike Restrepo, which was a film mostly about battle, Korengal examines the military life and experiences of those same men. The men are filmed in extreme closeup as they are interviewed; they express the most intense fear and exhilaration they ever experienced while in combat. They express bonds between each other that go beyond the intensity of their own family ties. One soldier states that he would gladly die for one of his fellow soldiers. Whereas Restrepo showed the \\"high\\" of combat, Korengal expresses more bitterness. Many of the soldiers interviewed after their deployment missed the camaraderie of the other men, missed the adrenaline of war, and the excitement of \\"cheating death.\\" One soldier expressed this simply as \\"I'd go back there if I could.\\" Reception Most reviews have been favorable with an 86% rating reported by Rotten Tomatoes. David Denby in The New Yorker describes the film together with Restrepo \\"As a record of the war, the two films are imperishable.\\" Justin Chang in Variety describes the film as \\"a worthy companion piece to Restrepo with this more reflective dispatch from the front lines of Afghanistan.\\" A few critiques, such as Ed Gonzalez in Slant Magazine, have found the documentary meandering. Gonzalez writes the movie is \\"an alternately gripping and dully meandering patchwork of these soldiers' simultaneously chill and quite literally maddening stay in the Korengal that pointedly shuns big-picture philosophizing.\\" References External links Official Website  War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) films 2014 documentary films American documentary films American films Documentary films about the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Kunar Province Films set in the Korangal Valley Films about the United States Army ","title":"Korengal"},{"id":"42926756","text":"Eklutna Annie is the informal name given to an unidentified murder victim discovered in 1980 in Eklutna, Anchorage, Alaska. An autopsy report concluded that she had been killed by a stab wound to the back. She was murdered by Robert Hansen, a serial killer who was responsible for murdering as many as 20 other women. Later in the year, the remains of topless dancer Joanne Messina were found in the same area. \\"Horseshoe Harriet\\", another unidentified woman, is believed to have also been one of Hansen's victims. Discovery and examination The skeletalized remains of Eklutna Annie were discovered buried in a shallow grave, alongside a series of power lines, on July 21, 1980. She wore several articles of clothing, including a knitted sleeveless shirt, a leather coat containing matches in a pocket, and knee-high boots. The victim was also wearing several pieces of jewelry: * An apparently handmade metal bracelet containing three turquoise stones * A copper necklace containing shell beads * A pendant heart Jewelry worn by Eklutna Annie. * A metal wristwatch consisting of circular links with a brown watch face * A ring carved from shell * Metal earrings Eklutna Annie was most likely white, but may have had a degree of Native American heritage. Her hair color ranged from light brown to strawberry-blond. Investigation Robert Hansen, a serial killer who resided in the area, admitted in 1984 that he was responsible for the victim's death. He claimed that she was either a dancer from a local bar or a prostitute, and that she was his first murder victim, adding that she had been murdered in the fall or early winter of 1979. Hansen admitted that he had stabbed this decedent as she attempted to escape from his vehicle, when he tried to transport her to his residence, Hansen said he believed she was from Kodiak, Alaska, and that immediately prior to his murdering her, as the woman struggled against his efforts to overpower her, she had hysterically screamed, \\"You're going to kill me!\\" Eklutna Annie is still unidentified, despite the fact that her face has been reconstructed in both 3-D and 2-D. Several missing women are believed to have also been murdered by Hansen. Roxane Easland, Karen Evan, Megan Emerick, and Teresa Davis have been ruled out as possible identities of Eklutna Annie's. Hansen was sentenced to 461 years in prison without the possibility of parole for her murder and three others. He died in prison in August 2014. In September 2020, a revised rendering of the victim was released by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The organization had previously released a digital reconstruction, and a clay bust had been created in the past. Aftermath The remains of Eklutna Annie are interred at the Anchorage Memorial Park Cemetery, under a marker reading \\"Jane Doe / Died 1980\\".

Francisco Coronel Navarro (b. 1941) is a Mexican artisan who work in lacquer ware and the revival of using gold leaf in this craft earned him the National Prize for Arts and Sciences in Mexico, among other recognitions. He was born in a very poor family in Olinal√°, Guerrero, a town noted for its history with gold and lacquer work. Beginning at age seven, he created lacquer pieces for sale, reintroducing gold leaf into his works in the 1970s. His work has been exhibited in Mexico and the United States, with two pieces made as gifts for Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II. Craft traditions of Olinal√° Coronel Navarro was born in Olinal√° in the Mexican state of Guerrero. Located in the La Monta√±a region of the state, northeast of the state capital, the town has been noted for its handcrafts since before the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, when artisans of the area paid tribute to the Aztecs making gilded gourd pieces. This tradition continued into the colonial period when lacquer techniques were added along with European taste for floral designs as well as influence from lacquered products imported on the Manila galleon . Career Coronel Navarro, nicknamed Chico, was born in a very poor family and for this reason did not go to school. Instead, when he was seven, he began working, learning lacquer and gold leaf techniques from his grandfather and parents to make items to sell at fairs in nearby towns such as Tlapa de Comonfort, Tepalzcingo, Tejalpa and Petalcingo. The artisan has exhibited his work in Mexico City, at venues such as the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares and at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington DC. He has created works for corporations such as Banamex and two of his pieces were created to be used as gifts to Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II. He has won over thirty major awards including the 2007 National Prize for Arts and Sciences, received from Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n. He used the 450,000 peso prize money from this award to expand his workshop and buy supplies. Coronel Navarro has also actively taught the next generations of craftspeople in his home state, including all eight of his children, five of whom make a living like their father. Artistry The artisan won the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for reviving the use of gold and silver leaf in Mexican lacquer ware in the 1970s. Before this time, such work had been abandoned because of its cost on both money and time. Although he creates trays and other smaller items, he specializes in larger pieces such as folding screen and especially boxes and chests. He is the only artisan in the town that takes individual orders. For smaller pieces he uses a soft local wood called copal, but the larger pieces are made by local carpenters of lin√°loe (Bursera linanoe), pine and ayacahuite. He also makes a kind of sewing chest, using a kind of large dried gourd. The lacquer process begins with sanding the piece well, then adding a coat of varnish made from chia seed and mineral oils, making his own chia seed oil using traditional methods. Then the piece is burnished completely with a smooth stone. Colors are made with minerals, anilines and other materials obtained locally. After the lacquering and decorating is complete, the drying process can take up to a month. Colors are added one by one and allowed to dry before the next is added. He does not use stencils nor repeats designs exactly, creating his works spontaneously, using brushes made from bird feathers or cat hair because they allow for fine lines. When gold or silver leaf is used, it is applied in fine sheets and then burnished and can be used as the background and painted over. The decoration commonly contains images of flowers, plants and animals.

Mussel Watch consults with experts to determine appropriate contaminants to monitor; these include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). As of 2008, Mussel Watch monitors approximately 140 analytes.Kimbrough, K. L., W. E. Johnson, G. G. Lauenstein, J. D. Christensen and D. A. Apeti, \\"An Assessment of Two Decades of Contaminant Monitoring in the Nation‚Äôs Coastal Zone\\", Silver Spring, MD. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NCCOS 74., 2008 In addition to the effects of contaminants, Mussel Watch is able to assess the effects of natural disasters, such as the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, and environmental disasters, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.Gunnar Lauenstein, \\"NOAA Flexes Mussels for Tracking Pollution\\", NOAA Office of Response & Restoration, January 11, 2012 Data collected by Mussel Watch can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of coastal remediation. The Mussel Watch Program utilized its 20 years of monitoring data to effectively analyze the impacts of Hurricane Katrina and has affected regulatory decisions based on the data it has collected on bivalve parasites.  History  NOAA describes the goal of Mussel Watch as ‚Äúto support ecosystem-based management through an integrated nationwide program of environmental monitoring, assessment and research to describe the status and trends of our nation‚Äôs estuaries and coasts.\\" Mussel Watch is a program that monitors the health of bivalves for contaminants along the coasts of the United States. This program was launched in 1986 and since then is the longest government-run monitoring program that has national influence. It was made in response to a legislative mandate to preserve the marine environment. In 2008 they released an assessment of their data from 1986 through 2005. In this report, concentrations of many different metals and organic pollutants are shown over the two decades of data collection. Using this set of data, trends can be identified for different coastal areas. Starting in 2000, the scientists that NOAA sent out to collect the mussels changed companies and the Mussel Watch program began employing citizen scientists to collect the mussels; this approach saved a good deal of money for the program. This can be seen on the local level in Washington State where The Snohomish County‚Äôs Natural Marine Resources Committee coordinated with the Mussel Watch program in 2007 to employ citizens to collect samples from the nearshore water Snohomish County.Kathleen Hermann, ‚ÄúSnohomish County Mussel Watch Program‚Äù, ‚Äò‚ÄôMarine Resources Committee of Snohomish County‚Äô‚Äô, 2011 In 2010 and 2012 Western Washington University students assisted Whatcom County Public Works. Mussel Watch originally monitored areas known for contamination where data would be easily found and monitored for trends in the toxicity data. Now the focus is to shift to areas of concern directed by organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Instead of focusing just on trends in the data Mussel Watch is looking to see if a given policy has actually made a positive impact on a specific environment.Gunnar Lauenstein, \\"Pollution: Changes Over Time\\" , ‚Äò‚ÄôCenter for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment‚Äô‚Äô, February 16, 2012  Structure  = National level = Mussel Watch uses a combination of national oversight from NOAA with a network of regional and local groups to monitor coastal health throughout the United States. NOAA and its National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) has a staff of scientists throughout the United States and partners with other Federal, State, non-governmental organization, and private sector partners throughout the world to work together towards achieving the goals of the Mussel Watch Program. Contamination in one coastal region can lead to effects in areas thousands of miles away and having a nationwide monitoring program enables NOAA to track these effects. A performance based quality assurance process (QA) is used by the Mussel Watch Program to maintain data quality. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) assist analytic laboratories in exercises to ensure that data collected from all labs have comparable accuracy and precision. The QA process reduces intralaboratory and interlaboratory variation.G. G. Lauenstein, A. Y. Cantillo and S. S.

The result of this pilot project was a significant reduction in labor time of professional staff in the field due to the assistance and proper training of citizen scientist volunteers. Proper training of volunteers is necessary to maintain consistent and accurate collection methods.Amy Johnson, \\"Mussel Watch Program Manual\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôSnohomish County Marine Resources Committee‚Äô‚Äô, 2008  Program design  = Contaminants of interest = More than 140 chemical contaminants (analytes) are monitored by the Mussel Watch Program. The EPA lists many of these analytes as Priority Pollutants under the Clean Water Act. They have been chosen based on their bioavailability, possible uptake and storage into animal tissues, toxicity to aquatic life, and potential harm to humans.  Metals  Metals measured in the Mussel Watch Program include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, silicon, silver, thallium, tin, and zinc. These metals come from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Different bivalve species have different bioaccumulation abilities for trace metals, and as a result oysters will accumulate about 10 times more zinc and copper than mussels. Mussels will accumulate about 3 times more lead than oysters. A report over a 20-year period released by the Mussel Watch Program in 2008 found that higher metal concentrations are found in urbanized and industrialized regions, and there is no significant difference in metal concentrations between the East Coast, the West Coast, and the Great Lakes regions. There is an increase in metal concentrations nationwide over time.  Organics  As of 2008, the organic contaminants monitored by Mussel Watch included 51 PCB congeners (out of a possible 209), 65 PAHs, DDT, butyltin, chlordane, and dieldrin. A complete list is available at http://NSandT.noaa.gov. Most of the organic contaminants monitored by Mussel Watch have an anthropogenic source, with PAHs being an exception as they are derived from both natural processes and anthropogenic sources. PCB congeners were selected based on a list of criteria including that the chosen congeners are already being measured by other scientific organizations. Organic contaminants can be compared across all sites and all species used by Mussel Watch. The same 20-year report discussed in ‚ÄúMetals‚Äù found that, similar to metals, elevated levels of organic contaminants are also found in urbanized and industrialized regions. Organic contaminants were found at every site. = Histopathology = ‚ÄúThe histopathology component of the Mussel Watch Program, quantifies the stage of gamete development, and the prevalence of nearly 70 diseases and parasites found in mussels and oysters. Trends in histopathology data may help to assess the effects of global warming.‚Äù = Sampling design =  Location  In 1986 the Mussel Watch Program only sampled 145 sites, but as of 2008 that amount has grown to approximately 300 active monitoring sites in the continental U.S., Alaska, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Many of these sites coincide with the 1976-1978 EPA Mussel Watch sites, and new sites have been chosen after consulting with state officials and academic professionals about ideal placement. Criteria for site selection includes; * Indigenous populations of mussels must be present * Shellfish beds must be large enough for repeat sampling * Must be natural substrate * Avoid point-source pollution * Select areas not authorized for shellfish harvesting for consumption The Mussel Watch Program does not use caged mussels, instead it uses naturally occurring bivalves. Sites were distributed 10‚Äì100 km apart to better represent large coastal areas which enable NOAA to more accurately construct a nationwide assessment. As a result, Mussel Watch can be used to ‚Äú‚Äúmonitor spatial distributions and temporal trends of chemical concentrations in coastal and estuarine regions of the US.‚Äù  Species  There is not a single species of mussel or oyster that is common to all US coastal regions, so the species for a given site are chosen based on their abundance and ease of collection. ‚ÄúMussels (Mytilus species) are collected from the North Atlantic and Pacific coasts, oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from the mid-Atlantic (Delaware Bay) southward and along the Gulf Coast, and zebra mussels (Dreissena species), an invasive species, are collected from sites in the Great Lakes.‚Äù  Collection  The majority of field collection and laboratory work is conducted by non-NOAA contract laboratories. At least once annually between November and March volunteers at each Mussel Watch site collect two groups of 50-100 bivalves. The samples must be collected within three weeks of the date the site was first sampled. This means that if a sample was first taken on April 15, 1987, then all future samples in subsequent years must be taken within three weeks of April 15. One group is used for testing organic contaminants while the other group is used for trace elements (metals). Sediment from a site exposed to the same water mass as the corresponding bivalve site and no more than 2 km away is collected concurrently with the bivalves. Sediment criteria measured includes total organic and carbonate carbon, moisture content, particle size, concentration of Clostridium perfringens, and concentration of Coprostanol (this was no longer measured after 1989). Different methods of bivalve collection are used depending on the site characteristics. A bivalve dredge is used in water deeper than 2 m, stainless steel tongs are used in 2-2.5 m deep water with a soft bottom, stainless steel pitch forks or quahog rakes are used in water less than 1 m deep, and collection by hand is done at some shoreline sites. The bivalves are then cleaned, packed in iced containers, and shipped to the appropriate analytical laboratory within two days of collection.  Analysis  NOAA awarded TDI-Brooks International with a five-year contract to analyze sediment and bivalve tissue chemistry from September 21, 2009 to September 20, 2014. TDI-Brooks has also conducted the testing for the previous ten years from 1999-2009. TDI-Brooks and their affiliate B&B; Laboratories conducts the organic chemical analysis, Rutgers University is subcontracted to conduct the histopathology analysis, and Texas A&M; is subcontracted to conduct the metal and nutrient analysis.\\"TDI-Brooks Awarded National Status and Trends (NS&T;) Program, Mussel Watch and Bioeffects Programs Analytical Chemistry\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôTDI- Brooks International‚Äô‚Äô, 2009 Due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the resources at these labs were shifted towards chemical analyses of the high- priority samples for the Gulf of Mexico. This caused significant delays, in some cases of more than a year, of analysis results for the Mussel Watch Program.Ruth M. Sofield, \\"Scientific Applications ‚Äì Mussel Watch: A Citizen Science Project\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôEnvironmental Sciences Department, Huxley College of the Environment at WWU‚Äô‚Äô, 2012  Projects and publications  = Past projects = National Tissue and Sediment Sample Archive: Many of NOAA's projects incorporate different programs to obtain the desired information. The National Status and Trends program of NOAA's started using mussel, oyster, and zebra mussel samples collected under the Mussel Watch Program in 1985 as a means to start specimen banking. This bank of samples allows NOAA to take a snapshot of certain contaminants of interest at any point in time allowing, through the use of analytical techniques, the tissue concentrations of the desired compound. This allows regulators to better understand the history of a certain compound.John Kucklick et al., \\"ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIMEN BANKING: A TOOL FOR DETECTING COASTAL CHANGE\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôNational Institute of Standards and Technology‚Äô‚Äô, July 22‚Äì26, 2007 Another project that took advantage of the Mussel Watch program was the assessment of coastal waters impacted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. By examining shallow waters for concentrations of DDT, conventional chlorinated pesticides, PCBs, PAHs, and metals after the hurricane NOAA scientists were able to compare results with the past 20 years of monitoring data from the same area. This consistent and historical record of contaminants from the Mussel Watch program proved effective in analyzing the impacts of Hurricane Katrina.NCCOS, \\" INTERAGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF HURRICANE KATRINA\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôNational Centers for Coastal Ocean Science‚Äô‚Äô Pathology of parasites in bivalves, using oysters and mussels collected via the Mussel Watch program tissue samples were investigated for parasites. The change in abundance of parasites geographically and over time can be a good indicator of exposure to a contaminant.Yungkul Kim and Eric Powell, \\"Distribution of Parasites and Pathologies in Sentinel Bivalves: NOAA Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôJournal of Shellfish Research‚Äù Vol. 26, No. 4, 1115-1151, 2007 The results of these pathology screenings have been used to show levels of contamination and have affected regulatory decisions.J. P. Bignell et al., \\" Mussel histopathology: effects of season, disease and species \\", ‚Äò‚ÄôAquatic Biology‚Äô‚Äô Vol 2, 1-15, 2008  Notable publications  Mussel Watch publishes reports approximately every 2 years concerning most sites and regions. Some compilations and other notable publications historically produced include: * An Assessment of Two Decades of Contaminant Monitoring in the Nation's Coastal Zone * Current Use Pesticides (1994‚Äì97) * Radionuclide Concentrations in Bivalves (1990) * An Assessment of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) in Sediments and Bivalves of the U.S Coastal Zone * A complete list of projects and publications can be found at: NCCOS Mussel Watch Contaminant Monitoring Arguably the most important publication to come from the Mussel Watch program is ‚ÄúAn Assessment of Two Decades of Contaminant Monitoring in the Nation's Coastal Zone‚Äù. This publication was intended for use by academics, concerned citizens, and governmental and other regulatory agencies. This report includes trends and relative levels of 140 different chemicals at 300 sampling sites across the US and Puerto Rico. Spanning the years of 1986-2006 this report has served to inform policy makers and interested individuals outside of regulatory agencies. Another notable publication is the report titled, An Assessment of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) in Sediments and Bivalves of the U.S. Coastal Zone. This report investigated the relatively new class of compounds known as Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) which act as flame retardants. These are found in many consumer plastics, textiles, electronics, and furniture cushion material. This report showed the relative levels of contamination geographically and linked high levels of PBDE to areas of high human population density. This has been significant due to the potential threat these compounds pose for global distribution.Gunnar Lauenstein, \\" An Assessment of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) in Sediments and Bivalves of the U.S. Coastal Zone \\", ‚Äò‚ÄôCenter for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment‚Äô‚Äô, August 18, 2011 = Current projects = Great Lakes Mussel Watch Supports the President‚Äôs Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is one of the many ongoing projects by Mussel Watch. This project, receiving attention and funding from the President's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), is a typical example of the types of projects Mussel Watch is being used for. Looking at Areas of Concern (AOC) in the US Great Lakes, Mussel Watch has increased sampling sizes and rates as well as updated techniques including doing caged mussel testing when shellfish beds are not available.Ed Johnson and Kimani Kimbrough, \\"Great Lakes Mussel Watch Supports the President‚Äôs Great Lakes Restoration Initiative\\",‚Äô‚ÄôCenter for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment‚Äô‚Äô, March 27, 2014 By looking at both sediment and mussel tissue concentrations researches have been able to better identify remediation efforts at Great Lake AOC. Like many other current Mussel Watch projects, the GLRI is using both historical data from Mussel Watch as well as increasingly more temporally and spatially prioritized data leading to more robust data sets far more applicable to specific AOC.  Significance  Mussels are the organism of choice for monitoring contaminant levels in the coastal regions for a number of reasons. Most mussels are generally sessile and cannot move to another location if their environment has become contaminated; this makes them good measures of environmental pollution. Mussels do not readily metabolize some of the organics that vertebrates do, making them a better choice when tracking substances such as PAHs. In addition, most mussels are filter feeders and filter water through their bodies to feed. This filtration makes them prime targets for picking up contaminants in the water. Mussels can provide information on if a system is recovering and if a remediation or cleanup effort is effective. In a successful remediation effort a decline of contaminants in the organisms is expected. An example of this is in Lavaca Bay, Texas, which is a site that has been contaminated due to chronic mercury releases from a nearby facility. By monitoring the mercury levels in oysters over several years it was discovered that the mercury content in the bay was decreasing.NOAA, \\"NOAA Mussel Watch: Indicators of Successful Restoration\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôNOAA's State of the Coast.‚Äô‚Äô, February 7, 2012 Due to the nature of their filter feeding, bivalves allow Mussel Watch to tracks changes in contamination levels in the environment by monitoring bivalve tissue concentrations. This is important because it can show whether a policy that is meant to protect and clean the environment or an ecosystem is actually working. Mussel Watch can be used to evaluate current policies to determine what, if any, changes need to be made to ensure that there is an improvement in environmental health.

The soundtrack was released on Aditya Music label on 30 May 2014, for which a promotional event was held at a hotel in Hyderabad on the same day. The soundtrack received positive response from critics. The Times of India wrote: \\"Music director Achu has dished out a peppy album for this romantic entertainer borrowing varied music elements like classic rock, blues, electronic dance music and desi beats.\\" IndiaGlitz stated, \\"Ra Ra Krishnayya by a less known music director like Achu does deliver goods. Although the tunes are not imaginative, the musician makes the package attractive with his creative inputs. The selection of the singers is good, especially Shreya Ghoshal and Achu himself. The lyricists are there to give the songs the much needed icing on the cake.\\" Milliblog wrote: \\"Mixed bag, but the good ones showcase immense promise for this composer!\\". Production =Development= Krishna Vamsi's prot√©g√© Mahesh, who was a friend to Sundeep Kishan, narrated the film's story even before the actor's moderately successful film Routine Love Story. But the project's confirmation happened after his 2013 release Venkatadri Express. The project was titled as Ra Ra Krishnayya and said to be produced by Vamsi Krishna Srinivas on the SVK Cinema banner, known for his previous film Solo directed by Parasuram and was launched at Film Nagar in Hyderabad on 11 August 2013. While the story, screenplay and direction were handled by Mahesh, Arjun Chelluri was recruited as the executive producer. It was later reported that Achu Rajamani would compose the music, Sriram would handle the cinematography, Marthand K Venkatesh would be the editor of the film, while Ramanjaneyulu would be the art director of the film. =Casting= Sundeep Kishan and Regina Cassandra were a part of the principal cast even before the commencement of the project in its development stages marking the couple's second film after Routine Love Story, which was released in 2011. The film was supposed to be Sundeep Kishan's first attempt at a pure love story, though he had done a few romantic comedies in the past. On 12 February 2014 it was confirmed that Jagapathi Babu would play the role of Sundeep's elder brother in the film while Kalyani, Tanikella Bharani, Chalapathi Rao, and Kasi Viswanath would play other crucial roles. In the end of May 2014, it was reported that Sundeep and Regina would share a sensuous kiss in the film. The reports were confirmed when the film's trailer featured a glimpse of a deep kiss between the leads. =Filming= During the launch of the movie on 11 August 2013, it was reported that the first shooting schedule would begin on 12 August and would continue till 26 August in Hyderabad, followed by the second schedule from 10 to 25 September in Kerala where some talkie part and two songs with the hero and heroine would be shot. It was then estimated that the entire shooting would be wrapped up with the third and final schedule in October 2013. However, in mid-October 2013, during the shoot at a Temple in Alapuzha at Kerala, the cast and crew of the film, including the director and Sundeep's manager, were attacked by Kerala RSS workers. The unit was attacked as they hired local people to act in a Telugu film and Sundeep's 57-year-old manager who attained permission was a Muslim. The shooting then continued at a rapid pace and at the end of February 2014, it was reported that the film's shoot was complete except for two songs and the climax scenes, which would be shot in the schedule commencing in March 2014. The kerala Schedule was handled by known line producer Appu Ajmal. Then, a song on the lead pair was shot at Hyderabad. After much silent shooting, at the end of April 2014 a song was shot on Sundeep and Regina near the beach road in Vishakhapatnam, and Regina wrapped up her part in the film on 29 April 2014. In the May, it was confirmed that the film's shooting and post-production activities were completed, aiming for a June 2014 release. Release After the end of the shoot in May 2014, the filmmakers declared that the film would be released in June 2014. On 4 June 2014, CineGalaxy issued a press release stating that they had acquired the overseas theatrical screening and distribution rights for the film, and that the film was tentatively scheduled for release on 20 June 2014. However, by the end of June, it was confirmed that the film had been scheduled for worldwide theatrical release on 4 July 2014.

Seath was a prominent figure in the Montreal art scene for sixty years and her artistic work included being a painter, printmaker (etching), commercial artist, and art instructor at the all-girls private school, The Study, in Montreal. Seath‚Äôs oil and watercolour paintings were primarily still life and landscape, exploring colour and adding abstract elements to everyday scenes. With her father‚Äôs failing business, chronic health issues and later separation from her mother, Seath joined the workforce right after high school to help support her mother and four siblings. She spent two decades as a commercial illustrator for various newspapers, the Montreal Witness and later the Montreal Star, constantly improving with supportive mentors at the companies. Seath achieved success within her illustrative career and financially she was able to afford art classes at the Art Association of Montreal and sketching trips of the Quebec countryside with Maurice Cullen. She began instructing art as a teacher at The Study which she continued for forty-five years. Her teaching methods were creative unlike the conformism of Victorian times. Being up to date with new trends, Seath encouraged creativity and exploration believing that, \\"The aims of Art education are to help children to see, to feel and to express beauty with clean, spontaneous feeling. It should given them the ability to use the experience of everyday life creatively, in order that they may gain increased intelligence through the use of their hands . . . Nearly all children have something to say through drawing, and training in Art results in refinement of thought, eye and hand.\\". Seath was a founding member of the Beaver Hall Group and was also a member of the Canadian Group of Painters in which she entered art into local and international exhibitions such as in Baltimore, Maryland (1931), Yale University, Cambridge, and Massachusetts. Her work was also exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, England in 1924 and 1925, at the 1939 New York World's Fair and at the exhibition A Century of Canadian Art at the Tate in London, England.  Early Personal Life  The daughter of Norman Alexander Seath and Lizetta Annie Foulds, Seath was born to a Scottish-Presbyterian family in Montreal on February 5, 1879. Her father had an unsuccessful business in importing leather goods, and also struggled with chronic illness; evidence suggests he was an alcoholic which led to the separation of her parents when she was a teenager. After Seath's parents separated she helped her mother raise her four siblings. To help support her family when she finished high school in 1896, she joined the workforce at the age of 17 and went straight to work at the Montreal Star where she was inspired by the head of the art department, who at the time was well-known cartoonist Arthur G. Racey. In 1901, Seath moved to the art staff on the Montreal Star where the dean of Canadian illustrators, Henri Julien, was another influence on the young artist who described him as supportive and helpful \\"with his splendid knowledge and talents.\\". Seath spent three years studying drawing with Edmond Dyonnet at the Conseil and lithography with J. A. Harris at the Board of Arts and Manufactures of Montreal during the late 1890s. Her drawing skills improved and her illustrations became a regular addition to the Weekly Star. In 1903, Seath was the first and only female contributor to the AAM exhibition organized by the Newspaper Artists‚Äô Association which shows her acclaim in a primarily male world of newspaper illustration. The Art Association of Montreal published a registry of local Canadian artists on June 29, 1903 noting that Seath was the youngest of the artists to be working in black and white. In Seath‚Äôs time working as a successful commercial artist she was able to afford art classes at William Brymner‚Äôs Art Association of Montreal. Brymner brought light and colour to Seath‚Äôs artwork which had primarily been in black and white. She pursued the use of bold colours when she embarked on open air sketching trips with Maurice Cullen into the Quebec countryside in 1911. Seath furthered her training at the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown under Charles Hawthorne. Seath pursued art from beyond her illustration work for newspapers and started to exhibit her work of etchings, watercolours, and oil paintings. Artistic career =Early training= Seath began her training in textile design at the Conseil des Arts et Manufactures, in the late 1890s. There, she took drawing and lithography classes, under Edmond Dyonnet and Robert Harris, respectively. At seventeen, she found work as a commercial illustrator for the Montreal Witness, and later joined the art staff at the Montreal Star in 1901. With the influence and encouragement of her mentors, the Montreal Witness‚Äôs caricaturist, Arthur G. Racey and political cartoonist, Henri Julien, within two years of working at the Montreal Star, Seath‚Äôs illustrations experienced a rapid improvement. Bolstered by her success in her chosen profession, Seath attended William Brymner and Maurice Cullen‚Äôs summer plein air sketching classes at the Art Association of Montreal. Later, she continued her studies under Charles Hawthorne, an American painter and renowned figure, at his school the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Since 1903, Seath proved to possess a strong, emotional affinity toward nature and everyday objects. Thus, she often painted still lifes and landscapes, documenting the domestic, rural, and urban life around her. Seath worked in a variety of media, such as charcoal, gouache, oil paint, pastel, watercolour, graphite, pen and ink. Post Impressionism and Fauvism influenced her style, and she took particular interest in abstraction and realism. This is evident in her still lifes and cityscapes, most of which favour a vibrant, yet earthy, colour palette with distinctive, curvilinear forms. In 1905, Seath submitted some of her oil paintings to the Art Association of Montreal‚Äôs spring exhibition. The following year, she participated in the annual exhibition at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1917, Seath‚Äîhaving worked a cumulative twenty years as a newspaper illustrator for the Montreal Witness, the Star, the Weekly Star, and latterly the Family Herald‚Äîwas invited to teach at the Montreal all-girls private school, The Study, by her friend and school founder, Margaret Gascoigne. At The Study, Seath taught with a passion that belied her shy, retiring disposition. Disregarding the traditional Victorian values and attitudes embraced at the time, Seath‚Äôs strong personality and progressive teaching methods sought to liberate the imagination, intuition, and spontaneity of an entire generation of young followers. =Mid-career and the Beaver Hall Group= Around 1920, Seath joined a diverse coterie of artists, known as the Beaver Hall Hill Group. Contrary to the patriarchal Group of Seven, the Beaver Hall Hill Group welcomed both male and female artists, held exhibitions of their combined work, and granted them access to other social events. Although the works they produced expressed each artist‚Äôs individual style and perspective, as a whole they presented a unified vision in their colour and mood. Insufficient funds eventually led to the group‚Äôs dissolution; however, many of its female members remained in close contact with each other soon afterwards. Notwithstanding her teaching responsibilities, Seath continued to find time to participate and exhibit her work. During the 1920s and 1930s, she‚Äîalong with Beaver Hall colleagues Sarah Robertson, Kathleen Morris, and Annne Savage‚Äîdesigned a series of Christmas cards inspired by Canadian artists for Rous and Mann. In 1925, she created woodcut illustrations for Gascoigne‚Äôs Chansons of Old French Canada. Due to the Great Depression, Seath, along with many other Beaver Hall artists, sought additional means to supplement their waning income. During those financially turbulent years, Seath‚Äîhaving already experienced multiple wage cuts‚Äîgrew anxious about her tenure at The Study. Consequently, in 1937, she in conjunction with Anne Savage organized Saturday morning modelling classes for children at the Art Association of Montreal. In 1939, Seath was elected a member of the Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal, an honour that was bestowed again the following year by the Federation of Canadian Artists. Although Seath was gradually gaining recognition for her skills, she‚Äîlike many aspiring female artists of this period‚Äîstill struggled to exhibit her work in galleries. Despite the disbandment of the Beaver Hall Hill Group, many of its members continued to identify and organize group exhibitions under the association‚Äôs name. Seath soon realized that by forming a unified alliance, the women painters stood a greater chance of attracting art curators and collectors to view their works. Therefore, in 1940, with the Beaver Hall painters‚Äô support of each other, Seath joined a four-woman show with Prudence Heward, Sarah Robertson, and Anne Savage at the Art Gallery of Toronto. She took part in several more group exhibitions, one in 1944 (December 4-30) at the Art Association of Montreal, another in 1945 at the Willistead Art Gallery (today, Art Gallery of Windsor), as well as a daunting six-woman show in 1950 (May 3-24) at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Gallery XII. =Later career and life= In her latter years, Seath, with her duties to The Study and her responsibilities caring for her ailing mother, gradually withdrew from the art community. Endorsed by the Canadian Group of Painters, the artist often held exhibitions in her home. After she retired from The Study at the age of eighty-three, Seath continued to experiment with different styles and techniques until her death in 1963. Collections Her work is included in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

He served as President of the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad. Early years Cattell was born on June 16, 1863, at Princeton, New Jersey, the son of Anna Ashburner and Thomas Ware Cattell. His boyhood and youthful days were spent in Lincoln, Pennsylvania, where his father held an honored position with the University. In 1880, Cattell entered the Pardee Scientific Department of Lafayette College and completed the four-year course there, having been graduated in 1884 with the degree of Civil Engineer. Career Immediately after his graduation he began the active practice of his profession and during the next five years was engaged in making surveys and valuations of the railroad and canal property in the State for the State Board of Railroad Assessors of New Jersey. During this period he also served the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company on preliminary and location surveys in Kansas and Indian Territory. Returning East in 1889, he served, until 1897, with the Long Island Rail Road as Assistant Chief Engineer in charge of the Construction Department, which detail included the practical reconstruction of the road and the design and construction of bridges, buildings, docks, piers, and terminals incident to the reconstruction and extensions. Severing his connection with the Long Island Railroad in 1897, Cattell opened an office as Consulting Engineer in New York City and until 1905 was engaged in the general practice of his profession, serving during that time as Consulting Engineer for the Brooklyn Park Department for bridge construction; the Ohio Southern Railroad for bridges and general improvement; and the Manhattan Beach Company for the installation of electric light, power, and refrigerating plant, electric railroad, marine bulkheads, and shore protection. During this time he was associated with prominent New York engineers in the valuation of many manufacturing plants, and made reports covering important existing and projected railways as well as terminals. He also reported on extensive irrigation projects since constructed by the United States Reclamation Service, and on a number of water supply and power projects in various parts of the United States. He prepared estimates for bids for various concerns on extensive improvements, such as the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Railroad; the portion of the New York City Subway's IRT Lexington Avenue Line/IRT Eastern Parkway Line from Brooklyn Bridge ‚Äì City Hall station at New York City Hall to Atlantic Avenue station at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, including the Joralemon Street Tunnel under the East River; and finally, the track elevation of the New York Central Railroad at Schenectady, New York; and assisted in the examination of the new filtration plants, pumping stations, and aqueduct tunnel of the Philadelphia Water-Works. Many other services were performed by Cattell while he was engaged in the practice of his profession as Consulting Engineer in New York City, and the foregoing only illustrates the nature and scope of his work up to the time that he became associated with the firm of E. H. Rollins and Sons, of San Francisco, California, which firm he served as Consulting Engineer from 1905 to 1908, making examinations and reports, for bond purposes, on various steam and electric railroads, among the latter being the Western Pacific Railroad. It was during these years that he served as President of the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Electric Railway. From 1908 to 1917, Oattell was engaged in general practice in San Francisco, with offices in the Foxcroft Building. He made a reconnaissance survey and report on the Valdez-Yukon Railroad project in Alaska, valuations of the Oakland Water-Works System, Oakland, Cal., the Oakland Traction System, and the Los Angeles City Railway System, as well as other valuations covering railways, power, and gas plants. His particular interest in water-front and harbor improvements caused him to be retained by the San Francisco-Oakland Terminal Railways to report on its Terminal Pier with special reference to the effects of salt water on concrete piers, and, later, as Consulting Engineer for the same Company, in connection with the terminal and harbor developments. It was during these years that he made a reconnaissance survey for the United States Forest Service of a railway line along the Klamath River, California; served as Consulting Engineer for the Peoples Water Company, Oakland, California, and for the Los Angeles Railway Corporation, with special reference to valuation matters. He made a valuation of the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company, Honolulu, Hawaii, and a valuation of the properties of the Oahu Railway and Land Company, also in Hawaii. Perhaps his best known work was in connection with the Committee of Management of the International Engineering Congress, for which he acted as Secretary-Treasurer from March 1913, to the practical close of the work of the Committee in the fall of 1916. During this period, Cattell gave a large part of his time to the duties devolving on him in this connection, and during 1915‚Äì16 he devoted himself almost entirely to this work. Being responsible for the organization and general management of the office of the Congress during these years, he gave his best thought and energy to the manifold requirements of the work, with special reference to all matters connected with general organization, with publicity, and with the collection and handling of funds. The publications of the Congress include a volume of general proceedings, with a history of the organization and development of the Congress from its initial inception to its final distribution of printed volumes of proceedings. This volume was prepared almost entirely by Cattell and furnishes in clear and condensed form a most interesting and valuable record of this great undertaking. It is not too much to say that the high mark of achievement set by this Congress was due in large degree to the excellent judgment and unremitting zeal with which Cattell undertook and carried through the duties of Secretary-Treasurer of the Committee of Management of the Congress. With the first call of the Government for the formation of an Engineer Officers' Reserve Corps early in 1917, Cattell enrolled and was commissioned a Major of Engineers on March 1, 1917. This was followed by the entrance of the United States in the World War, and Major Cattell was ordered to report for duty at Camp Lee, Virginia, on January 5, 1918. Early in the summer of 1918, he was transferred from the Training Camp to the Office of the Chief of Engineers, at Washington, D. C., to organize the Section of Historical and Statistical Data. Under his able guidance the Section collected and put into permanent form all historical and statistical information concerning every unit of engineers, from the date its organization was first proposed in the memoranda of General Pershing or the General Staff, through its authorization, mobilization, training, and shipment overseas, to the date on which it was finally mustered out. The data thus collected should be invaluable as a guide in the organization of American engineering forces should history ever repeat itself. With the retirement of Major Cattell, on September 30, 1919, from the United States Army, ill health overtook him, and he did not again take up the active practice of the profession of civil engineering. He spent some months in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and returned to California in January 1920, where he resided in Alhambra until his death, after a long illness, on October 10, 1920. Personal life In 1889, Cattell was married, at Lincoln, Pennsylvania, to Jennie Woodhull. They had three children, Gilbert Woodhull, Anna Ashburner, and Dorothy. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and the Masons. Among the professional societies he belonged to were: the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Consulting Engineers, the Pacific Association of Consulting Engineers, the American Water Works Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain), and the American Railway Engineering Association. Cattell was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers on October 7, 1896, and served as a Director from 1912 to 1914.

The once thriving community is located on U.S. Route 59 (US 59) southwest of Wharton near Wharton Regional Airport. Mackay began as a railroad stop near a large ranch in 1881 and saw an influx of immigrants beginning in 1907. The community had its own post office from 1921 to 1937 but most of the buildings were gone by 1990. There were two businesses and a grain silo at the site in 2014. Geography Mackay is on US 59 a distance of to the southwest of Wharton at the intersection of County Road 467. The entrance to Wharton Regional Airport is on US 59 farther to the southwest. In 2014 there were four structures in the area, a gun store, a small house, a grain silo and a combination filling station and restaurant. Bosque Creek flows southeast through the area before emptying into the Colorado River south of Wharton. History The old Mackay post office booth is an exhibit in the Wharton Museum. Mackay began as a station on the New York, Texas and Mexican Railroad in 1881. It was named after Nevada silver magnate John William Mackay, one of the railroad's investors. The station was located on property owned by Abel Head \\"Shanghai\\" Pierce whose nearby ranch was managed by his nephew A. P. Borden. A post office operated for several months in 1885 before being closed. The United States Department of Agriculture set up an experimental tea and camphor farm in 1907. Russian and Chinese workers were imported to work on the farm and Borden built homes for them near his company store. In 1912, he erected a school for the immigrant children which was later donated to the county as a common-school district. At the insistence of his wife, Borden built a church in nearby Pierce where she taught Sunday School. Postal service was restored to the community in 1921 with Borden as the postmaster. In 1922 Borden retired from managing the Pierce Ranch to run his own farm from a large house in Mackay. Borden died in 1934 and the property was sold to Johnny B. Ferguson, an oil wildcatter. Mail service stopped in 1937 and the 1940 census recorded 20 residents in Mackay. Ferguson found oil on the ranch in 1949 and operated his company out of Borden's old store. In 1953 Mackay's school became part of the Wharton Independent School District. Ferguson became famous for owning thoroughbreds Top Deck and Go Man Go. In 1967, Wharton bought from Ferguson for an airport. Ferguson died in 1978. Two years later the airport expanded to . By 1990 most of the buildings had disappeared.

Background  Qian Hongzuo was born in 928. He was the sixth son of father Qian Chuanguan (King Wenmu), who was then was still serving under his father (Qian Hongzun's grandfather), Wuyue's first king Qian Liu (King Wusu), as the acting military governor (Jiedushi) of Wuyue's two main circuits, Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered at Wuyue's capital Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang)) and Zhendong (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). His mother was Qian Chuanguan's concubine Lady Xu Xinyue. While he was ranked as Qian Chuanguan's sixth son, traditional histories heavily implied that he was the second-born in terms of Qian Chuanguan's biological sons, as they emphasized that Qian Chuanguan and his wife Lady Ma were sonless and that, therefore, Qian Chuanguan was sonless into his 30s because Qian Liu had forbidden officials from taking concubines, until Lady Ma personally pleaded for an exemption for Qian Chuanguan due to that reason ‚Äî and listing Qian Chuanguan's fifth son Qian Hongzun and Qian Hongzuo among the biological sons born from Qian Chuanguan's concubines, while omitting their older brothers Qian Hongzhuan (), Qian Hongxuan (), Qian Hongyou (), and Qian Hong'an (), although only Qian Hongyou was explicitly stated to be an adoptive son.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 83. After Qian Chuanguan succeeded to the throne after Qian Liu's death in 932 (and changed his name to Qian Yuanguan),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Qian Hongzun was initially designated the heir apparent. As his sons grew older, Qian Yuanguan built a mansion of the heir apparent for Qian Hongzun. Shortly before Qian Hongzun was to move into the mansion, there was a time when Qian Hongzuo and Qian Hongzun were gambling with each other, and Qian Hongzun made a comment in jest, \\"The Lord King is building an office for me. I am willing to gamble you for it.\\" When they then played dice, however, Qian Hongzuo won, causing Qian Hongzun to lose his composure. Qian Hongzuo, without losing composure as well, stated, \\"When you, fifth brother, enter the headquarters, I, Hongzuo, will receive the seal of a general.\\" He bowed to Qian Hongzun, but Qian Hongzun was not pleased and left immediately. Qian Hongzun died in 940. Qian Hongzuo was thereafter made the deputy military governors of Zhenhai and Zhendong, effectively being designated the heir. In 941, Qian Yuanguan was deathly ill. After a conversation with his officer Zhang De'an () in which he toyed with the idea of passing the throne to an older member of his clan because of Qian Hongzuo's youth, he ultimately decided on entrusting Qian Hongzuo to Zhang. He died shortly after. As there were rumors that another officer, Dai Yun (), whose wife was a relative to Qian Hongyou's wet nurse, was planning on supporting Qian Hongyou to succeed Qian Yuanguan, Zhang initially kept Qian Yuanguan's death a secret; rather, he had his soldiers ambush, arrest, and kill Dai, and then had Qian Hongyou demoted to commoner rank and changed in name back to his birth name of Sun. Zhang then led the other officials and officers in announcing Qian Yuanguan's will, naming Qian Hongzuo the military governor of Zhenhai and Zhendong. Qian Hongzuo shortly after took the position, apparently, not only of military governor, but also king.  Reign  At the start of his reign, Qian Hongzuo designated the chancellor Cao Zhongda as regent. Shortly after, when the soldiers complained about unevenness of rewards to them, the officers were unable to quell their discontent, requiring Cao to personally speak to them and comfort them before the discontent faded. As king, Qian Hongzuo was said to be mild-tempered and respectful, studious, diligent, and capable of discovering hidden evils. Once, upon hearing that the state had 10 years worth of excess food storage, he decided to exempt the people of taxes for three years. Around the new year 942, Shi Jingtang the emperor of Later Jin, to whom he was formally a vassal, formally created him the King of Wuyue, the military governor of Zhenhai and Zhendong, and honorary chancellor with the title of Zhongshu Ling (). By fall 943, however, the commander of the headquarter corps, Kan Fan (), was said to be so dominant at Qian's court such that, even though Zhang De'an and another officer, Li Wenqing (), tried to counterbalance his power, they could not do so, and Zhang and Li ended up being sent out to be prefects of Chu (ËôïÂ∑û, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang) and Mu (Áù¶Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou), respectively, such that Kan and Hu Jinsi became particularly dominant after that. Later in the year, Qian married the daughter of the senior general Yang Renquan as his wife.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. (He had a prior wife, a Lady Du, but she appeared to have died before his becoming king. Consort Yuan herself, though, apparently did not live a long time after the marriage, although when she died is unclear.) By 944, Wuyue's southern neighbor Min was deeply caught in civil war, with the general Zhu Wenjin (having earlier assassinated the emperor Wang Yanxi and taken control of the capital Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian)) claiming the title of Emperor of Min, battling Wang Yanxi's brother Wang Yanzheng (in control of Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), who claimed the title of Emperor of Yin. Zhu sought aid from Wuyue and sent brother(s) and son(s) to serve as hostages in that effort, but there was no record of any responses by Qian. After Zhu was later assassinated, Wang Yanzheng briefly took control of all of the Min realm and reclaimed the title of Emperor of Min, but soon the general Li Renda led a revolt against him at Fu. Li Renda established friendly relations with Wuyue, as Wang Yanzheng later also attempted to do in seeking aid from Wuyue when Jian Prefecture came under the attack of Min's (and Wuyue's) northwestern neighbor Southern Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. Before Wuyue could intervene at all, however, Jian fell to Southern Tang, ending Min, and Southern Tang, at least nominally, took over all of the former Min realm, although Li Renda, while formally a Southern Tang vassal, continued to control Fu and the surrounding area.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. By late 945, Qian was said to have trusted the wicked officer Cheng Zhaoyue (), who had previously been a wealthy merchant who was able to become an officer by ingratiating Kan and Du Zhaoda (), a nephew to the deceased Lady Du. Kan became irritated at the close association between Qian and Cheng, and when Cheng tried to appease Kan by apologizing to him, Kan made him more fearful by stating, \\"I wanted to kill you at first. Now that you are showing remorse, I will not do so.\\" Cheng thereafter conspired with Hu, and had Qian issue orders making Kan and Hu the prefects of Ming (ÊòéÂ∑û, in modern Ningbo, Zhejiang) and Hu (ÊπñÂ∑û, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang) respectively. Kan initially wanted to refuse the order, but Hu persuaded him to accept. Cheng then falsely accused Kan and Du of wanting to support Qian's cousin Qian Renjun () to be the new king, and Qian Hongzuo then put Kan and Du to death and put Qian Renjun under house arrest. Cheng used this opportunity to accuse many officers of being in league with Kan and Du, and it was said that some 100 were either killed or exiled. By 946, Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing, unable to get Li Renda to yield actual control of the Fu region by himself, sent the official Chen Jue to Fu to try to persuade Li Renda to do so. When Li Renda refused, Chen, initially without Li Jing's orders, launched an army and attacked Fu. Li Renda requested aid from Wuyue, and while most officials and generals at Qian Hongzuo's court opposed intervention, Qian himself decided that he needed to aid Li Renda, and sent the generals Zhang Yun () and Zhao Chengtai () with 30,000 men to aid Li Renda. Initially, the joint forces of Wuyue and Li Renda were unable to stop the Southern Tang attack, and Fu appeared in danger of falling. In spring 947, Qian, working with the officers Shuiqiu Zhaoquan () and Chu Wen (), ambushed and killed Cheng (whose power he had become apprehensive about). He then released Qian Renjun from house arrest.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. In summer 947, Qian sent another detachment, commanded by Yu An (), to aid Fu, but initially was unable to land. The Southern Tang general Feng Yanlu, believing that allowing the Wuyue army to land would allow them to be conclusively destroyed, decided to allow them to do so. Once the Wuyue army landed, however, they aggressively attacked the Southern Tang sieging army, and the Southern Tang forces collapsed. The siege was lifted, and Zhang and Yu thereafter returned to Wuyue. Qian Hongzuo sent the general Bao Xiurang () to command a Wuyue detachment to be stationed at Fu. Simultaneously, he made his younger brother Qian Hongzong chancellor ‚Äî which, in light of later events, appeared to be intending to designate Qian Hongzong as heir. (By this point, Later Jin had fallen to the Khitan Liao state, and Qian Hongzuo had apparently formally submitted to Liao's Emperor Taizong as a vassal, although he also apparently submitted to the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan, who then established Later Han in rivalry to Liao, as well.) Qian Hongzuo died in fall 947. He left a will designating Qian Hongzong as the military governor of Zhenhai and Zhendong, and Qian Hongzong thereafter took over control of the state.

The Windows 10 Mobile and Microsoft Windows versions are no longer supported. It is the sequel to Dots. It was released for iOS platforms on May 29, 2014, and became available for Android on November 12, 2014. Gameplay Unlike Dots, Two Dots has power-ups, objectives and a campaign (series of levels), while lacking online multi- player capability. At the start of the game, only level one is unlocked; each subsequent level is unlocked only when the previous level is beaten. Levels are grouped into \\"worlds\\", with the first ten levels assigned to one world, and after that every 25 levels grouped into a world. Worlds differ in gameplay elements, obstacles and objectives. In the earliest levels of the game, objectives include sinking anchors and breaking ice; the objective is to accomplish a target number of each, for example to sink a specified number of anchors. As each world is completed, the player receives a postcard for that world. The game now also features a weekly \\"Treasure Hunt\\" mode, where players compete worldwide to be the first to complete a sequence of seven levels. A new world is added with each major game update, currently on a release schedule of roughly once every three weeks. As of October 16, 2020 there are 3025 levels. At the start of each level, the objectives are displayed; furthermore, the player must complete them within a specified number of moves. At the start of a level, a set of dots is \\"dropped\\" from the top of the in- game area. The player must connect at least two dots of the same color in order to make a move. They can be connected horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally. The connected dots are removed from the game area; dots directly above those will then drop down until they hit other dots or the floor beneath. When a player connects a grouping of at least four same-colored dots to form a complete circuit, all of the dots in the game area with that same color will disappear, and any dot(s) fully inside the circuit will become \\"bomb(s)\\" which will explode in all eight directions once those dots drop down. If there are no two adjacent same color dots to connect, the dots are automatically scrambled so that the player can make a valid move, similar to other games. If it is difficult to clear the stage, you can use items such as shufflers, erasers, targets, and color boosters to get help. If you want an item, you can get a free item by looking at the advertisement provided by the game, or you can pay for the item and buy it. Reception Two Dots received fairly positive reviews from critics on GameRankings and Metascore. While it was praised for its simple design and a variety of obstacles and level layouts, it was also criticized for its slow life-regenerating system. The player begins with five lives, and it takes 20 minutes for a single life to regenerate, with up to a total of one hour and forty minutes required to regenerate the maximum of five lives. It was also pointed out that some levels are nearly impossible to beat, draining a player's lives quickly and prompting the player to make in-app purchases of extra lives or booster packs. Two Dots was given the people's voice for best game on handheld devices for the 2015 Webby Awards.Webby Awards 2015 At the 2018 Webby Awards, it was nominated for \\"Best Visual Design\\", while it won the People's Voice Award for \\"Puzzle\\".Webby Awards 2018 References IOS games Android (operating system) games 2014 video games Puzzle video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Two Dots"},{"id":"42927240","title":"2006‚Äì07 St. John's Red Storm men's basketball team"},{"id":"42927244","text":"Banner Township is a township in Saline County, Arkansas, United States.

Smith Jr. (born February 5, 1954) is a scientist, researcher, professor, founder and CEO of OyaGen. Smith has written over 100 publications on his research in RNA editing, AIDS, oncology, and immunodeficiency, among others. Early life Harold Smith was born in Germany to an Austrian mother and American father who was stationed in Austria with the military at the end of World War II. In 6th grade, Smith and his family moved from Frankfurt, Germany to Massachusetts where he completed his high school education. Education Smith received his Bachelor of Arts in Biology in 1975 and his Master of Science in Veterinary Pharmacology and Physiology in 1978 at Purdue University. He then went to the State University at Buffalo where he obtained his Masters of Arts in Molecular Biology in 1980 and his PhD in Molecular Biology in 1982. He carried out postdoctoral studies at SUNY Buffalo and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Career After completing his postdoctoral position with Dr. Susan Berget at Baylor College of Medicine in Biochemistry in 1986, Smith became an assistant professor at the University of Rochester. Between 1991-1994, Smith discovered the molecular mechanism by which proteins recognize messenger RNA and participate in site-specific assembly of enzyme complexes to orchestrate the modification of select cytidines to uridines in a process known as C to U RNA Editing. This work has served as the foundation for numerous findings concerning RNA sequence modifying mechanisms and DNA mutating mechanisms that determine cell and protein diversification and was cited for its groundbreaking ideas in an article written by L. Chan for Scientific American. In 1992, he was given an associate professorship with a limited tenure, which became fully tenured in 1996. In that time, he was also the director of graduate studies in the Department of Pathology. In 1994, Smith organized an Albany Research Conference which was the first international meeting focused on RNA editing and in 1997, Smith organized and chaired the first Gordon Conference for RNA Editing. From 1997-1998 he served as the director of Medical School Biochemistry in Cell Structure and Function, and subsequently as director of Molecules to Cells in the Double Helix Medical School Curriculum. In 2001, Smith became a full professor. He received more than $8 million in total funding over the following 12 years from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies. Harold Smith founded OyaGen, Inc. in 2003. OyaGen is a biopharmaceutical company which develops therapies to fight viral illness through editing enzymes, with a focus on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Founded with a seed fund by the University of Rochester and the Trillium Group, Smith has successfully brought in $6.5 million in Angel investment and $2.1 million in total federal grant support for OyaGen. In 2005, the company began preclinical trials on a drug that OyaGen believes will protect the body's natural A3G, which functions as an editing enzyme in mutating HIV DNA during its replication in such a way that the virus can no longer code for itself. In 2008, he edited a book for Wiley and Sons on RNA and DNA Editing that brought together the next generation of scientists working in the field to comment on their work and the future of the field. That same year, Smith, through the University of Rochester Medical Center, received a $100 thousand grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to aid in research for curing infectious diseases, such as HIV. The New York State Common Retirement Fund invested in OyaGen in 2006 and again in 2010. In February 2013, Cannabis Science, Inc. added Smith to its scientific advisory board. He was added to IGXBio's Scientific Advisory Board in 2014, as well as the Education Board at the American Health Council in August 2016. He continues as a professor at the University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, teaching biochemistry and biophysics.

Officially, Arkin (2005) says that there are three types of code name: * Nicknames ‚Äì a combination of two separate unassociated and unclassified words (e.g. Polo and Step) assigned to represent a specific program, special access program, exercise, or activity. * Code words ‚Äì a single classified word (e.g. BYEMAN) which identifies a specific special access program or portion. A list of several such code words can be seen at Byeman Control System. * Exercise terms ‚Äì a combination of two words, normally unclassified, used exclusively to designate an exercise or test In 1975, the Joint Chiefs of Staff introduced the Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System (NICKA) which automated the assignment of names. NICKA gives each DOD organisation a series of two-letter alphabetic sequences, requiring each 'first word' or a nickname to begin with a letter pair.

It saw the deployment of 5th Airborne Brigade to North Carolina in the largest Anglo- American exercise for twenty-three years. Relieved from the back-to-back commitment of aircraft carriers to the Adriatic in support of UNPROFOR, the Royal Navy sent a large force, headed by a Carrier Task Group with HMS Invincible flying the flag of Rear Admiral Alan West, Commander UK Task Group; HMS Fearless and an amphibious group; and a mine countermeasures group headed by HMS Hecla.John Roberts, Safeguarding the Nation: The Story of the Modern Royal Navy (Pen and Sword, 2009). U.S. Atlantic Command, headquartered at Norfolk, Virginia, directed the exercise. The aim of the operation was to practise a joint UK force in combined manoeuver in an overseas theatre. The exercise provided the first opportunity to test the new UK Permanent Joint Headquarters, which provided the core of the British Joint Headquarters in support of the exercise Joint Commander. The exercise also was designed to test the new UK Joint Rapid Deployment Force which was established on 1 August 1996.

Most of the operation took place at night, to avoid observation of the operation by the Okinawans, who resented the presence of chemical munitions on the island. The Chemical weapons were brought from Okinawa under Operation Red Hat with the re- deployment of the 267th Chemical Company and consisted of rockets, mines, artillery projectiles, and bulk 1-ton containers filled with Sarin, Agent VX, vomiting agent, and blister agent such as mustard gas. Chemical agents were stored in the high security Red Hat Storage Area (RHSA) which included hardened igloos in the weapon storage area, the Red Hat building (#850), two Red Hat hazardous waste warehouses (#851 and #852), an open storage area, and security entrances and guard towers.

The company was founded in 2003 by Harold Smith, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of Rochester. OyaGen was founded on research conducted by Smith and Hui Zang, an HIV researcher at Thomas Jefferson University. Research OyaGen's research has focused on developing drug-based treatments for HIV and the company has three lead HIV drugs based upon editing enzymes in preclinical development. The company is exploring ways to prevent HIV from disabling the production of APOBEC3G (A3G), a naturally occurring editing enzyme that stops HIV from replicating. A3G combats HIV infection by interacting with and mutating the virus' RNA. The mutations genetically damage the virus protein and render HIV unable to replicate which halts the spread of the virus. In laboratory testing, OyaGen was able to use drug therapy to shield A3G from HIV, which allowed A3G to function normally and halt the spread of the virus. The company is also researching drugs that protect A3G from viral infectivity factor (ViF). ViF is a protein created by HIV that \\"tricks\\" the body into destroying A3G by binding to it. Interfering with ViF's ability to bind to A3G can effectively block HIV replication. OyaGen is researching several compounds that prevent ViF from disabling A3G, including A3G agonists, ViF destabilizers and ViF dimerization antagonists. Funding The company received seed funding from Trillium Group's University Technology Fund and the University of Rochester Medical Center. It has also received funding from the New York State Retirement Common Fund's Private Equity Program. The New York State Retirement Common Fund has invested approximately $1.4 million in the company since 2006.

It represented a range of production and trades workers in the printing industry. History The PIEUA was formed on 6 December 1916 through the merger of several state-based affiliates of the Australasian Typographical Union - the New South Wales Typographical Association, the Queensland Typographical Association, the West Australian Typographical Industrial Union and the South Australian Typographical Association. The impetus for amalgamation was a desire to seek an award under the federal arbitration system, which was achieved in the following year. In its early years the PIEUA primarily represented compositors - skilled tradesmen responsible for typesetting, who formed an 'aristocracy of labour' within the printing industry. Soon after its formation, however, the PIEUA began expanding its industrial remit to cover a broader range of workers. In NSW the Printing Trade Women and Girls' Union was absorbed in May 1917 (on the proviso that they would not 'accept employment in the sections of the Industry now covered by male labor'), while members of the moribund Cardboard Boxmakers' Union voted to merge with the PIEUA in 1919. In 1888 the Western Australian Typographical Society formed. This union changed its name in 1900 to the Western Australian Typographical Industrial Union of Workers and became the Western Australian branch of the Printing Industries Employees Union of Australia in 1916. The formation of the Victorian branch of the PIEUA only occurred in 1921 due to disputes between the small craft unions in the printing trade. The Victorian Typographical Society merged to become part of the PIEUA Victorian branch. The Australian Bookbinders & Paper Rulers' Association is believed to have formed around 1878, and merged to become part of the PIEUA Victorian branch. The Ballarat Typographical Society formed in 1857. It was a small and conservative group, which avoided amalgamations until it merged to become part of the PIEUA Victorian branch. The PIEUA merged with the Amalgamated Printing Trades Employees' Union of Australia in 1966 to form the Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU).

Biography  The fourth child and only daughter of Montague John Morris and Eliza Howard Bell, she was born in Montreal, Quebec and was educated there, going on to study for ten years (1907‚Äì1917) at the Art Association of Montreal with William Brymner. She also spent two summers under Maurice Cullen at his outdoor sketching classes.http://www.heffel.com/Artist/Buy/Canadian/Kathleen_Morris.aspx Her father died in 1914, the same year she began to exhibit with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Art Association of Montreal. In the early 1920s she joined the Beaver Hall Group and in 1921 she began to show with the Ontario Society of Artists. In 1922 Morris went to live with her mother in Ottawa, Ontario. Eliza Bell was a strong woman with feminist opinions, and encouraged her daughter's involvement in art. Support such as this was significant, as it was a struggle for women at the time to cross the conventional social boundary lines and succeed as an artist. Her mother's cousin, portrait painter Robert Harris also took an active interest in her career.Barbara Meadowcroft, Painting Friends: The Beaver Hall Women Painters, 1999 The Beaver Hall Group officially dissolved in 1922, but she still participated in their exhibitions while living in Ottawa. She returned to the Montreal area in 1929 and lived there for the remainder of her life. Morris became a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts that same year. She took inspiration from the work of James Wilson Morrice while Morrice was also interested in her; he purchased one of her paintings from Watson Art Galleries in Montreal. Her work has been favourably compared to that of A. Y. JacksonEvening Telegram (Toronto) December 8, 1928. p.32. and in 1930 she won Honourable mention at the Second Willingdon Arts Competition, placing second to Frederick Varley.National Gallery of Canada.

Morris suffered from a congenital disorder of the nervous system which challenged her physically but could not suppress her joy for life. The current medical term is Cerebral palsy. She never married and after the death of her mother in 1948 she lived with her brother Harold. In 1978 she suffered a stroke and could no longer paint.Prakash, A.K., Independent Spirit. 2008. She died in Rawdon, Quebec at the age of 93. Her obituary asked for donations in memoriam to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\\"Obituaries: Morris, Kathleen Moir, R.C.A.\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto) December 27, 1986: D8.  Style and work  Village Street Scene, 1920 Morris painted scenes of urban and pre-industrial rural Quebec not in support of a French Canadian identity but to suggest that the \\"primitive\\" could provide a sanctuary from modern life.Tippett, By a Lady, 68,81 From the first, deeply textured, strokes of her early works, to the gentle swoops of colour and line in her later landscapes, Morris exhibited a unique style that set her apart from her contemporaries. She painted from sketches, in which she simplified the forms and applied colour in bold, thick patches. Her subject matter reflected her kinship with her surroundings and an appreciation of the simple life. She also felt deeply for the animal world, voicing her concerns publicly to protest the annual seal hunt. Throughout her life, she spent two months of every summer in Marshall's Bay near Arnprior, Ontario, at a small secluded cottage that had been in the family for over a hundred years. There she would paint the fields and sunsets or indulge in her love for animals by painting cows and sheep. However, since exhibitors preferred her town rather than her country scenes, most of her time was spent developing her winter sketches into larger canvases. Morris's paintings can be compared to the work of Les Nabis, a group of mainly French painters active in the 1890s, whose works were influenced by Paul Gauguin‚Äôs expressive use of colour and rhythmic pattern. Like them, Morris translated her surroundings in an intuitive manner, guided by colour more than form, the latter at the service of the former. They resonate with courage, both personal and artistic, and place her in the same category as David Milne. They hover on that edge between reality and the unseen, allowing the eye to complete the image, allowing the one looking into the picture to see into the heart of the artist. Morris painted that way she was, unassuming and yet very present. In his assessment of the Beaver Hall Group exhibition at the 1937 Royal Institute Galleries in London, W.G. Constable singled out Morris as an outstanding example of the second generation of Impressionists. Although few of her paintings are dated and titles are often used more than once, her paintings are nostalgic reminders of a former time. = Recognition = In 1923 the Montreal newspaper La Presse began to take notice of her work.Art Association of Montreal Annual Spring Exhibition: (Montreal, March 16, 1923) Albert Laberge. \\"Visite au salon de peintres Canadiens.

Marikina Heights is one of the barangays of Marikina measuring some 184.16 hectares. Once a privately owned hacienda, it is now populated by 35,416 people according to the 2010 National Census. History Before becoming a barangay in 1978 by the Presidential Decree 1489, Marikina Heights started out as a grazing and pasture land for carabaos, cows, goats and horses. Because it was owned by the Tuason family, the Marikina Dairy Farm was established in what was now known as C&P; Mall, Palmera Homes and the Tanseco Residence. A monument is placed at the Evolution Park in Marikina Heights commemorating Filipino soldiers in the Korean War. During the Japanese occupation, Marikina Heights became a vital military location as the Imperial soldiers dug through parts of the area leading to Paliparan, Sto. Nino and Concepcion where the airfields are situated. One of the said tunnels lies underneath the Police sub-station along Bayan-Bayanan Avenue. When the combined Filipino and American troops retaken in Marikina Heights was defeat by the Japanese during the Allied liberation and ended in World War II. Due to the land's terrain which resembles the highlands of South Korea, the area also became a training ground for Filipino soldiers prior to their deployment in the Korean War, thus earning the nickname \\"Mari-Korea\\". The late 1950s witnessed the growth of the area as the Tuasons decided to develop their landholdings into the Marikina Heights subdivision. Finally, on April 2, 1978, President Marcos signed the Presidential Decree 1489, declaring Marikina Heights as another barangay in Marikina's growing populace. Present Day Marikina Heights is now a lush barangay with many trees and maintained parks. Marikina's best exclusive schools are in this barangay; St. Scholastica's Academy Marikina (for girls) and Marist School (for boys). Ayala Malls Marikina, opened in 2017, is located here.

Previously, she had been in commission in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1963 to 1970 as USC&GS; Whiting (CSS 29). In 2005 the ship was transferred to Mexico, and she was commissioned in the Mexican Navy as ARM R√≠o Tuxpan (BI-12), Mexico's first dedicated hydrographic survey ship. Construction and commissioning NOAAS Whiting (S 329)Whiting was built at a cost of $2,300,000 (USD) as a \\"coastal survey ship\\" (CSS) for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Marietta Manufacturing Company at Point Pleasant, West Virginia.NOAA History: Coast and Geodetic Survey Ships: Whiting She was launched on 20 November 1962 and delivered in July 1963.Appendix E, pp. 12-16.Ships of the NOAA Fleet, Rockville, Maryland: United States Department of Commerce, June 1989Polmar, Norman, The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, Seventeenth Edition, Naval Institute Press: Annapolis, Maryland, 2001, , p. 614. The Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned her on 8 July 1963 in a ceremony at New Orleans, Louisiana,Invitation to commissioning ceremony of USC&GS; Ship WHITING on July 8, 1963 as USC&GS; Whiting (CSS 29), the first and only Coast and Geodetic Survey ship of the name. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey and other United States Government agencies merged to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, Whiting became a part of the NOAA fleet as NOAAS Whiting (S 329),researchvessels.org NOAA Ship WHITING - S329 thus far the only NOAA ship to bear the name. Capabilities Whiting had a two-drum bathythermograph winch with a maximum pull of 1,000 pounds (454 kg). The lower drum had 3/16-inch (4.75-mm) wire rope, while the upper drum had 13,123 feet (4,000 meters) of 1/4-inch (6.4-mm) wire rope. She had a 27-foot (8.2-meter) telescoping boom with a lifting capacity of 2,500 pounds (1,134 kg) and a 27-foot (8.2-meter) articulating boom with a lifting capacity of 2,768 pounds (1,256 kg), as well as a 16-foot A-frame with a maximum load of 6250 pounds (2,835 kg) and a working load of 5000 pounds (2,268 kg). For acoustic hydrography and bathymetry, Whiting had 12-Khz deep-water echosounder, a 100-kHz shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, a 24- and 100-kHz hydrographic survey sounder, and the Intermediate Depth Swath Survey System (IDSSS), which is a 36-kHz sidescan sonar. In 1989 she underwent a major upgrade involving the installation of Hydrochart II, which employed a Microvax computer system to acquire and process hydrographic data. Hydrochart II gave her the capability to generate bottom contour charts with a swath width of approximately two-and-a-half times the water depth, ranging from 10 to 1000 meters (32.8 to 3,280 feet), in real time. Whiting had an ice-strengthened steel hull. Whiting carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled diesel- powered Jensen survey launches. For utility and rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with gasoline-powered outboard motors, a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat. At the time of her decommissioning, Whiting was the most technologically advanced hydrographic survey platform in the world. She and her survey launches were outfitted with modern multibeam echosounders and sidescan sonars, allowing efficient and rapid hydrographic surveys. The data storage for survey data was close to 2 terabytes, and nine workstations allowed survey personnel to process the data with state-of-the-art software and create three-dimensional models of the ocean floor, side-scan mosaics, and imagery of historical wrecks.greenenvironmentnews.com NOAA News: \\"N.O.A.A. Ship Whiting Decommissioned after 39 Years of Service,\\" May 2, 2003. Operational career Whiting conducted hydrographic and bathymetric surveys involving nautical charting and ocean mapping, primarily along the United States East Coast and United States Gulf Coast and off territories of the United States in the Caribbean.NOAA Marine Operations Center: NOAA Ship Whiting She also imaged historical wrecks like that of the United States Navy monitor and was used for oceanography, fisheries research, and homeland security surveys. During her 39-year career, her operations took her from as far north as Duluth, Minnesota, to as far south as Honduras in Central America. =John F. Kennedy, Jr., crash= After receiving word that the Piper Saratoga II HP flown by John F. Kennedy, Jr. had disappeared during a flight on the evening of 16 July 1999 and was feared to have crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, Whiting, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Gerd F. Glang, interrupted her survey operations in the Delaware Bay on 18 July to make a 24-hour voyage at about 12 knots (14 mph; 22 km/hr) to the search area and participate in the search for the aircraft and its passengers. Arriving on the scene on the morning of 19 July 1999, Whiting joined the NOAA survey ship NOAAS Rude (S 590), which had been searching for the wreckage of the aircraft since 17 July using sidescan sonar and multibeam sonar. Whiting brought a more advanced sidescan sonar ‚Äì only recently installed aboard the ship ‚Äì to the effort that allowed a higher resolution and a higher search speed. While Whiting searched one area in dense fog, dodging lobster pots, Rude found and marked a high-confidence target in another area that appeared to be the missing Saratoga and radioed the United States Navy rescue and salvage ship about the discovery; Whiting then searched the same area to gain higher-resolution images of the target. Late on 20 July, U.S. Navy divers from Grasp confirmed that the target was the missing aircraft. Whiting and Rude competed their survey of the crash area on 21 July 1999, then assisted the United States Coast Guard in maintaining security in the area. Later on 21 July, the two ships were released from duty in the crash area, and Whiting set course for Washington, D.C., to take part in the assumption-of- command ceremony for incoming NOAA Corps Director Rear Admiral Evelyn J. Fields at the Washington Navy Yard on 27 July.Steelhammer, Rick, It Happened in West Virginia: Remarkable Events That Shaped History, First Edition, Guilford, Connecticut: Globe Pequot Press, 2013. .noaa.gov Disaster Response: NOAA Ships, Planes, and Officers Offer Valuable Capabilities: JFK, Jr. Airplane Crash: July 16, 1999Konop, Dane, \\"A Behind the Scenes Look: NOAA Ships Survey, Locate JFK Jr. Plane,\\" history.noaa.gov, undated.

The U.S. Coast Guard requested her support in the search for the downed aircraft, and she soon got underway for Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, where she replenished her supplies and refueled before proceeding to the crash area.Anonymous, \\"NOAA SHIP WHITING TO JOIN EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 990 SEARCH\\", NOAA News, November 1, 1999. Arriving on the scene early on 2 November,Anonymous, \\"NOAA SHIP WHITING BEGINS ITS SEARCH FOR EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 990\\", NOAA News, November 2, 1999. she put her sidescan sonar to use and discovered the debris field of the crash on the ocean bottom on her first surveying pass, only 12 hours after arriving. After only a day of search operations, however, a gale with 50-knot (58-mph; 93-km/hr) winds and 20-foot (6-meter) seas forced Whiting and U.S. Navy survey ships in the area to return early on 3 November to Newport, where Whiting's crew compared their survey data with data collected by U.S. Navy ships.Anonymous, \\"BAD WEATHER HAMPERS NOAA SHIP WHITING EGYPTAIR SEARCH\\", NOAA News, November 3, 1999. A break in the weather allowed Whiting to return on 5 November to continue her bottom-mapping operations; although she had to suspend mapping operations briefly when the towfish containing her sidescan sonar became entangled in a lobster pot and was damaged, her crew was able to improvise a night repair in difficult weather conditions and put the sonar back into service.Anonymous, \\"NOAA SHIP WHITING CONTINUES TO SEARCH FOR EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 990\\", NOAA News, November 5, 1999. Whitings bottom map combined with charts provided by NOAA's Office of Coast Survey allowed the U.S. Navy rescue and salvage ship to anchor safely over the debris field without disturbing the wreckage. Having completed her Egyptair Flight 990 work and turned over continued mapping and search operations to U.S. Navy remotely operated vehicles, Whiting departed Naval Station Newport on 11 November 1999 to return to her home port at Norfolk, Virginia.Anonymous, \\"NOAA COMPLETES ITS MISSION IN EGYPTAIR 990 INVESTIGATION\\", NOAA News, November 16, 1999.Chartuk, Robert, \\"NOAA Team Responds to Egyptair Crash,\\" NOAA Report, January 2000, pp. 3, 6.noaa.gov NOAA News: \\"NOAA COMPLETES ITS MISSION IN EGYPTAIR 990 INVESTIGATION,\\" November 16, 1999.Disaster Response: NOAA Ships, Planes, and Officers Offer Valuable Capabilities: Egypt Air Flight 990 Plane Crash: October 31, 1999 Whiting's first sonar image of the wreck of the U.S. Navy submarine on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, made in late July 2001 when Whiting discovered the wreck's exact location for the first time. =USS S-5= In July 2001, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration asked Whiting to search for the wreck of the U.S. Navy submarine , which sank 15 nautical miles (28 km) off Cape May, New Jersey, in September 1920. Whiting, which had just completed a summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 to search for the wreck. Whiting's survey department approached the project as it would any typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags ‚Äì obstructions on the ocean bottom that snarl fishing nets and gear ‚Äì that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided Whiting with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, Whiting moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, Whiting found the wreck of S-5 directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. Whiting then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene. NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS Whiting gathered to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.Weirich, Jeremy B., LTJG, \\"How the NOAA Ship Whiting Found the USS S-Five,\\" oceanexplorer.noaa.gov, undated. =Decommissioning= Whiting made her final cruise in NOAA service in 2002, when she deployed to the United States Virgin Islands, the Gulf of Mexico, and the southeast coast of the United States in support of homeland security and nautical charting. She returned in November 2002, bringing an end to 39 years of service. Finding the aging Whiting no longer economical to operate, NOAA decommissioned her on 2 May 2003. NOAA replaced her with the survey ship NOAAS Thomas Jefferson (S 222).Wertheim, p. 1008. Elizabeth River at Town Point Park in Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 April 2005, the day of her transfer to Mexico and commissioning into Mexican Navy service.

Biography Dean was born Viola Blanche Evans in 1892 to John James and Catherine Evans, the youngest of their twelve children. She was raised on her parents' farm in Clay County, Alabama, where she first developed an interest in wildlife. She attended Lineville High School and, after graduating in 1908, began teaching at Hatchett Creek Presbyterian Church. After deciding to become a teacher, Dean studied education at Jacksonville State University and later at Valparaiso University. In 1924, following her graduation from the University of Alabama with a degree in chemistry, she became a biology teacher at Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, Alabama. She remained there until 1957, spending a total of almost 30 years teaching in the public school system. She married William Dean in 1939, but they divorced less than a year later; Dean decided to keep her husband's surname. Dean became a passionate naturalist and conservationist after teaching. One of her projects in the 1940s was the campaign to have the U.S. government to declare Alabama's Clear Creek Falls a national park, although the campaign failed and the falls were ultimately incorporated into Lewis Smith Lake. In the 1950s‚Äì60s, she helped to found the Alabama Ornithological Society, the Alabama Environmental Council, and the Alabama Conservation Council (then known as the Alabama Conservancy). Additionally, she was involved in the Birmingham Audubon Society, the Alabama Academy of Science, the National Association of Biology Teachers, the American Fern Society, and Delta Kappa Gamma. She established an Outdoor Nature Camp in 1951, which she directed annually for thirteen years to educate teachers and other adults about Alabama's natural history. In 1967, after assisting the Alabama Environmental Council in designating Alabama's first national forest, William B. Bankhead National Forest, she was awarded a prize from the National Audubon Society for conservation education; she was the first person from Alabama to receive such an award. Dean was inspired to write several books on Alabama's zoology and botany by her frustration with the lack of books available on the subject. She self-published Let's Learn the Birds of Alabama in 1957, Trees and Shrubs in the Heart of Dixie in 1961, Let's Learn the Ferns of Alabama in 1964, and Wildflowers of Alabama and Adjoining States in 1973. Dean died in 1974, aged 88, from complications caused by a major stroke. Legacy In 1975, Dean won the Alabama Library Association's first posthumous Annual Author Award for her non-fiction books. The Alabama Wildflower Society later established the Blanche E. Dean Scholarship Fund and named its Birmingham chapter after Dean. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.

Microtox utilizes a bioluminescent bacteria (Allivibrio fischeri) to determine the toxicity of a particular substance and/or substrate. During cellular metabolism, these bacteria naturally emit light as a part of cellular respiration, which can be measured as luminescence. When exposed to toxic substances, a decrease in luminescence can be observed and percent change in luminescence can be directly correlated to toxicity. Allivibrio fischeri were specifically chosen, as these bacteria could be preserved by freeze-drying to increase shelf life and use. Both solid phase (soils and sediment) and aqueous acute toxicity testing (described below) can be conducted using this technology.  Materials  = Analysers = The _Microtox Model 500_ is a laboratory-based photometer that measures acute toxicity.

November 1992. Retrieved 28 May 2014.  Methods  = Preparation of Samples = Microtox can be applied to a variety of matrices including drinking water, stormwater runoff, effluent, industrial discharges, soils and sediments. Most samples do not require special preparation before testing besides adjusting the salinity to 2%. However, samples that have certain characteristics, such as high turbidity levels, may require special preparation. If samples require a salinity adjustment to lower the salinity, this can be accomplished by adding an appropriate amount of Microtox Osmotic Adjusting Solution to dilute the sample. For example, adding 0.1 mL of MOAS to 1 mL of sample would result in a dilution of 90.9% of the original concentration. If a greater salinity is required, this can be accomplished by dissolving solid sodium chloride in the sample to achieve a final salinity of 2% for the protection of Allivibrio fischeri. Highly turbid samples that contain particulate matter will be required to settle before the test can be conducted. Particulate matter in the sample can interfere with bioluminescence by absorbing light and give misleading test results. Interference of luminescence can also occur with samples which are highly colored (particularly red, brown or black). It may be necessary to centrifuge samples to obtain an acceptable clarity for the test. If samples contain chlorine, this may alter the toxicity to Allivibrio fischeri and also give misleading results. The samples can be de-chlorinated using a sodium thiosulphate and deionized water solution that does not affect test results. Ideally, the pH of samples should not be modified since it is preferable to test each sample at the original pH level. However, if it is necessary to adjust the pH this should be done by adding either sodium hydroxide solution or hydrochloric acid to the sample. Unlike water samples, soil and sediment samples are not homogenous.‚ÄúSolid-Phase Test (SPT)‚Äù Azur Environmental. 1998. Retrieved 28 May 2014. As a result, it is difficult to obtain representative samples from such matrices. Toxic substances are likely to bind to particulate matter, and the extent to which toxic materials bind depends on the composition of the particles. For example, smaller particles such as clay tend to tightly bind to chemicals, acting like ion exchange resins. Microtox tests for sediment and soil differ in the way the matrix is prepared for contact with Allivibrio fischeri. To obtain a representative soil or sediment sample, it is necessary to conduct an elutriate test. Sediment elutriates can be prepared through extraction with either distilled water, saline water, or an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, or hexane. To run an elutriate test a soil sample is mixed with an extractant for a period of time, then allowed to settle and a sample is taken from the extract. If particulate matter is in the sample that was collected, it may be necessary to centrifuge the sample for optimal clarity. Additionally, the pore water of sediments can be collected by centrifugation and tested without extraction. = Procedures = There are five major Microtox tests including the Basic Test, the 100% Test, the Solid Phase Test, the Comparison Test, and the Inhibition Test. Of these five tests, three are used for sediment and soil testing including the Basic Test, the 100% Test and the Solid-Phase Test. All of these versions follow the same general method of reconstituting the Allivibrio fischeri reagent in the Reconstitution Solution. Corrections are made for salinity and particulate matter, then the bacteria are exposed to the sample solution depending on the methods of the particular test. The light output of the bacteria is measured using a photometer after five and 15 minutes from exposing the bacteria to the samples. The light measured directly correlates to the toxicity of the sample, producing data that allows for the calculation of EC50 or IC50s, or other ECxx and ICxx values.Microtox Acute Toxicity Basic Test Procedures Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014. _Acute Toxicity Basic Test_ is a procedure that measures the relative acute toxicity of a sample. This test is the best protocol for testing samples of unknown toxicity, a high level of toxicity, or when the test results are required to provide the highest confidence and precision. This test consists of two controls and eight sample dilutions in duplicate. _Acute Toxicity 100% Test_ is a procedure that tests the sample at 100% sample concentration and as a result includes adding reagent solution directly to the sample.Microtox Acute Toxicity 100% Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014. This test is used for samples that are expected to have a low level of toxicity and is generally used as an environmental screening tool. Compared to the Basic Test it is more sensitive to operator technique, and as a result may be less precise. _Acute Toxicity Solid-Phase Test_ is a procedure that allows the test organism to come in direct contact with the solid sample as particulate in an aqueous suspension. Normally, this test provides results indicating equal or higher toxicity when compared to eluate or pore water tests of the same sample.Microtox Acute Toxicity Solid-Phase Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014. This is due to either equal or increased bioavailability resulting from direct contact. This test is subject to several sources of interference of luminescence including loss of bacteria from effects other than toxicity such as filtration of the sample; absorption of light due to color; and scattering of light due to turbidity. Corrections can be made by testing a sample of similar particle composition that is known to not be toxic. This test consists of two controls and 13 sample dilutions in duplicate. The Solid-Phase Test exposes the bacteria in such a way that is not always possible with pore water and elutriate. _Acute Toxicity Comparison & Inhibition Tests_ are the best procedures for testing samples with a low level of toxicity when an ECxx can not be determined using the Basic Test.Microtox Acute Toxicity Comparison & Inhibition Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014. These protocols are recommended for testing waste water treatment plant effluent, stormwater runoff, drinking water, pore water, and eluate. These tests use multiple replicates of a sample at a single concentration. Similar to the Basic Test, the Comparison Test protocol uses zero time light readings used for correcting the timed light level readings. The Inhibition Test procedure does not use zero time light readings and therefore, can not use a correction factor for the timed light level readings. Both of these tests consists of five controls and five replicates of the sample at a single concentration. = Microtox Omni Software = The Microtox Omni Software was developed by Azur Environmental and allows users of the Microtox Model 500 Analyser to run tests, visualize data, calculate statistics and generate reports.‚ÄúAzur Environmental MicrotoxOmni Software for Windows 95/98/NT‚Äù Azur Environmental. 1999.

Common applications are for testing the toxicity of both marine and freshwater, as well as sediments for pesticides and other inorganic and organic chemicals. _Drinking Water:_ Microtox is used to test drinking water sources in many areas where either accidental or deliberate contamination is possible. Toxic contaminants in drinking water are indicated by a change in the color or intensity of light, or by a change in the rate of oxygen use. _Lakes and Rivers:_ Microtox is used to test the toxicity of lake and river sediments contaminated by metals or nonspecific contaminants. The Solid-Phase test is used for sediments, while either the Basic test or the 100% test is used for pore water. _Sediment testing:_ Microtox is used to test and evaluate the toxicity of various marine and freshwater sediments contaminated by metals and organics. Aqueous extracts of contaminated soils, drilling muds, and sludge. Microtox data may be used to establish apparent effects threshold (AET), sediment quality standards and used for NPDES permits, as well as Superfund cleanup levels. _Industrial:_ This bioassay is used in the assessment of the toxicity of complex industrial effluent sources. It is a cost-effective way for monitoring and testing large numbers of samples. Microtox can also be applied as an early warning system (EWS) and aid in detecting the presence of toxic materials, as well as predict the outcomes of other bioassays and tests.Qureshi AA, Bulich AA, Isenberg DL. 1998. ‚ÄúMicrotox Toxicity Test Systems - Where They Stand Today‚Äù.

Concerns have also been expressed regarding the use of sediment extracts and not the sediment itself. It is possible that only water- soluble contaminants will be tested for, and therefore may not be representative of the full range of contaminants present in the sediment. Extracts may also remove contaminants that are not bioavailable. This could lead to an over or under estimation of contaminants and their biological effects.

After she graduated from high school in 1891, her family moved to Cripple Creek, Colorado after gold had been discovered there. Although she originally wanted to work as a telegraph operator, she was encouraged by her father to attend medical school at the University of Michigan. Anderson became a licensed physician after graduating from medical school in 1897. She returned to Cripple Creek before moving around Colorado in attempt to practice in Denver, Greeley and Eaton, but found it difficult to find work. She was briefly engaged but was left at the altar by her fianc√© in 1900. In 1904, she was appointed Coroner of Grand County, Colorado, during which time she investigated many of the deaths involved in the construction of the Moffat Tunnel railroad. After contracting tuberculosis in 1907, Anderson relocated to Fraser, Colorado, where residents affectionately nicknamed her \\"Doc Susie\\"; for 49 years, she was the only physician in Fraser. She tended to a range of patients and medical conditions including childbirth, skiing injuries, and particularly pneumonia during the 1918 flu pandemic. Although most of her work involved making house calls to patients, Anderson never owned a horse or car, and she was usually paid in food or firewood rather than money.

The location was chosen to minimise travel, as it is within two hours' flight of the team's group games, and is a short trip to the airport. It also allowed acclimatisation to the weather, as well as good security. After the World Cup the resort was opened to the public. According to a Harvard Business School Study Jan 5, 2016 the team base camp \\"Campo Bahia\\" was a significant contribution to the victory of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In 2013, the DFB identified Campo Bahia, a resort site under development by private investors, led by a German businessman. Spanning 15,000 square meters along the beach, the site comprised 14 two-story villas and a total of 64 residential units, with each villa housing six players. Along with the 23-player squad, the resort would also house the team staff of 39. The site included an outdoor swimming pool, a spa, a lounge and dining area, a fitness center, smaller informal areas to gather, and an auditorium for team meetings. A new media center and football pitch with a goalkeeper training facility was built within walking distance. Bierhoff saw the project as an ideal way of building team spirit. Given its stage of construction, as the first ‚Äúrenters‚Äù of the site, the DFB was able to provide input on some of the site's features. One observer explained, ‚ÄúThe base was a very important point in the planning of the tournament for Germany. [. . .] The idea of living together [was] very good for team spirit. You have your own space but the players are always bumping into each other around the resort. It‚Äôs different to a hotel where you just have a room. [It was] the perfect place to rest and calm down. Getting the right home base was always a huge thing for Oliver Bierhoff.‚Äù He recalled his aim with the site: I vividly remember the harsh criticism people voiced when we announced that we'd set up camp in the state of Bahia, near Porto Seguro. The main ‚Äúaccusation‚Äù was we would have a whole complex built from scratch, just for us, and we never really managed to squash these rumors. The truth is, we didn't just want to organize the umpteenth training camp. It had to be something special. And so it came that this very compact place somehow created a special atmosphere, with all of us running into each other several times a day, with groups of six players each sharing a house. And let's not forget the ferry! On the day we arrived we took an age-old ferry to cross an estuary. I could see in the players‚Äô faces it was dawning on them there was something new happening. That ferry ride ended up having symbolic value‚Äîcoming home to Santo Andre. When we returned home, everyone knew that our work had been done. Leaving it, we all knew that we had a tough day ahead of us. Germany's National Team Office Manager Georg Behlau, explained: The Campo Bahia complex had quiet zones and operative centers. The house in the middle was where players, coaches, and backroom staff met for meals, with tables and benches placed outdoors. In their respective villas, the players had to organize themselves and even do some of the chores, which obviously differed considerably from the typical five-star hotel service. Shouldering this kind of responsibility prevents you from getting into a rut, from succumbing to monotony. Also, over the last few years, we‚Äôve extended the travel options for the players‚Äô friends and family. Their partners, children, parents, and friends came to visit at Campo Bahia, and that created a great kind of family atmosphere. I think the players could use their time off in the best possible way. While L√∂w and Bierhoff were initially worried by the resort's small size, the team's psychologist believed that forcing players to live together in close proximity would ultimately build a stronger team spirit. Upon this recommendation, players were assigned to four bungalows, and housemates were deliberately chosen to prevent the formation of cliques. For example, two players for the Bundesliga club Bayern Munich were grouped with a member of rival clubs Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04. Additionally, room televisions were limited to Germany's two main public broadcasting channels, encouraging players to relax outdoors and engage in social activities. German players noted that the openness of the resort and its central complex allowed players to interact regularly, spend time with one another, and grow closer. One player said, ‚ÄúWe are incredibly happy that we have had these facilities. We have developed a team spirit that has been very good for us. It‚Äôs been perfect.‚Äù58 Bierhoff added, ‚ÄúWorking. Relaxing. Spending time together. And leaving people enough breathing space. Campo Bahia was perfect and met many of the requirements of a modern working environment.‚Äù References External linksOfficial website Buildings and structures completed in 2014 Germany at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Seaside resorts in Brazil Sports venues in Bahia 2014 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Campo Bahia"},{"id":"42928568","text":"Han shi waizhuan (), translated as Exoteric traditions of the Han version of the Songs, Illustrations of the Didactic Application of the Classic of Songs, or \\"The Outer Commentary to the Book of Songs by Master Han\\", is a book written in the Eastern Han dynasty, attributed to Han Ying ( fl. 150 BCE).

Soltan was shot, imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life in prison after protesting against the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In protest of his unjust detainment by the Egyptian authorities, Soltan entered into an open- ended hunger-strike on 26 January 2014. The hunger-strike was supported by a world-wide campaign effort that led to his freedom. The U.S. government intervened at the highest levels and successfully facilitated his release and return to the United States on 31 May 2015. His hunger-strike lasted 489 days.\\"Mohamed Soltan, U.S. Citizen Imprisoned in Egypt, Is Released\\" aljazeera online, 31 May 2015 Since his release, Soltan has dedicated his life to advocate for freedom, democracy and social justice. On June 6, 2020, Soltan filed a lawsuit against the former prime minister of Egypt, Hazem el-Beblawi, under the Torture Victims Protection Act. Personal life Soltan is an Egyptian-American human rights advocate. He was born in Egypt and moved to the US in the mid-1990s at the age of 7 where he lived in several cities (Boston, Kansas City, Detroit, Columbus). Soltan played junior varsity and varsity basketball in high school, and was active in his local community. From a young age, he took initiatives to helping people, and frequently volunteered in local soup kitchens. Soltan is the second oldest of five children, and his mother and father are middle school sweethearts from a small village in Egypt. He grew up in a loving and supportive household that always emphasized independence and creativity. His father, Salah Soltan, is a prominent scholar of Islamic jurisprudence, who taught at many distinguished Islamic educational institutions, and has authored over 80 books on varying issues from the obligation to vote in the US, to married life in the West and women's inheritance in Islam. His father is ideologically affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, but Mohamed and his family have confirmed that he is not a member of that group or have any other affiliations in Egypt. Arab Spring Soltan took an open-ended break from his school when the 2011 revolution broke out and went to Egypt to join the youth's revolution for freedom. He and his friends at Ohio State University created shirts for the youth coalition to wear in the entrances of Tahrir Square. Soltan joined the sit-in in Tahrir and was on the frontline at the presidential palace in Egypt when President Mubarak was forced to step down. Weeks after, Soltan returned to the US and toured university campuses to speak about his experience during the revolution. Return to Egypt After graduating from Ohio State University with a bachelors of science degree in economics in 2012, Soltan moved back to Egypt, to aid his ill mother who was receiving treatment for cancer. He worked as a business development manager for an Egyptian petroleum service company. During that time, his father served as the Deputy Minister of Islamic Endowment in the 2012 Morsi administration. Rabaa Square Soltan has been making international headlines since August 2013, when he was swept up in the crackdown on pro-Morsi demonstrators protesting the 3 July 2013 Military Coup de'√©tat. In protest of the return of military rule, Soltan joined the Rab‚Äôaa Al-Adawiya sit-ins, where he served as a de facto citizen-journalist and often coordinated with foreign journalists and the protestors. As a result, he became a first hand witness to the violent dispersal of the sit-in, where he sustained a gunshot wound in the arm by snipers while live-tweeting what later came to be known as the bloodiest massacre in Egypt's recent history. Arrest Soltan was subsequently arrested, along with three journalists by Egyptian security forces on 25 August 2013 shortly afterward, while recovering at his family home in the suburbs of Cairo. He disappeared for two days, and was blindfolded, beaten, and interrogated by state security officers about his father's whereabouts. During the first months of his imprisonment, he was tortured, beaten on his broken arm and was deliberately denied medical attention. Soltan wrote a letter to his mother, letter to President Obama, and a letter home describing the circumstances in which he was living. Hunger strike Months into his imprisonment, Soltan began an open-ended hunger strike that lasted 489 days to protest his unjust imprisonment and the inhumane detention conditions. On 30 May 2015, shortly after an Egyptian judge sentenced him to life in prison along with 37 others, including 13 journalists, the United States government spoke out against the sentencing and the White House condemned Soltan's sentencing, and demanded his immediate release. According to a Guardian report citing an independent medical report facilitated by the US embassy, Soltan had lost at least a third of his bodyweight and was unable to stand unassisted on his 100th day of hunger strike in jail. On 27 May 2014, a video showing Soltan was released by CNN's Christiane Amanpour in which Soltan asks President Obama and the international community for help. #FreeSoltan Campaign Soltan's hunger-strike was supported by a world-wide campaign effort, both locally in Egypt and Internationally in the US and Europe. The campaign was managed by Soltan's older sister and consisted of family, friends, lawyers, human rights defenders from across the world. The campaign focused on managing messaging, channeling it effectively in legal and governmental circles. The campaign succeeding in rallying thousands of people from all walks of life behind Soltan's plight. The #FreeSoltan campaign has accused the U.S. government of not doing enough to push Egyptian authorities to resolve or drop his case, which they say is politically motivated. Supporters of Soltan have also called the charges against him to be politically motivated. The hunger strike by Soltan has sparked criticism of the Egyptian authorities on social media and led to mass petitions and demonstrations to highlight his imprisonment. A US embassy official has said embassy representatives have visited Soltan several times at the Tora prison outside Cairo and have been present at Soltan's hearings. The campaign became the complementing component in the formula that eventually led to Soltan's freedom. Advocacy Following his release, Soltan has briefed many senior government officials. He testified in congress to the Lantos Commission on Human Rights. Soltan also briefed non-governmental organizations, human rights organizations and other advocacy groups to discuss the gross human rights violations he had faced in prison and that many continue to face.

The obverse depicts the head of Roma, while the reverse depicts Gaius Marius as triumphator in a chariot; the young man on horseback is probably his son. Marius was awarded this triumph for his victory over the Teutoni. The gens Fundania was a plebeian family at Ancient Rome, which first appears in history in the second half of the third century BC. Although members of this gens occur well into imperial times, and Gaius Fundanius Fundulus obtained the consulship in BC 243, the Fundanii were never amongst the more important families of the Roman state.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 189 (\\"Fundania Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Fundanius is derived from the surname Fundanus, originally designating a resident of Fundi, a city of southern Latium, which was granted civitas sine suffragio at the close of the Latin War in 338 BC. The ancestors of the Fundanii probably came to Rome from Fundi, perhaps soon after the conclusion of the Latin War.Chase, p. 118. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Fundanii were Gaius and Marcus. Other praenomina appear occasionally, including Quintus among the earliest of the Fundanii, and Lucius in imperial times. All of these were very common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The only cognomen used by the Fundanii under the Republic is Fundulus, a sausage, belonging to a large class of surnames derived from the names of familiar objects and animals.Chase, pp. 112, 113. Lamia, a surname of Lucius Fundanius Aelianus, consul in AD 116, was inherited from the Aelia gens, where it was a regular cognomen.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

As consul, Fundanius went into Sicily to oppose Hamilcar Barca during the First Punic War. After first refusing Hamilcar's request for a truce for the interment of the dead, Fundanius relented and asked Hamilcar for the same terms, which the Carthaginian granted.Livy, xxiv. 16.Gellius, x. 6.Diodorus Siculus, Fragmenta Vaticana, p. 53. * Marcus Fundanius Fundulus, plebeian aedile in 213 BC, together with his colleague, Lucius Villius Tappulus, accused certain Roman matrons before the comitia tributa of a disorderly life, and procured their banishment.Livy, xxv. 2. =Others= Marcus Fundanius, tribune of the plebs in BC 195, together with his colleague, Lucius Valerius, proposed the abolition of the lex Oppia, a sumptuary law restricting the dress and manners of Roman women.

The covering map is indicated by the vertex colors. In graph theory, a planar cover of a finite graph G is a finite covering graph of G that is itself a planar graph. Every graph that can be embedded into the projective plane has a planar cover; an unsolved conjecture of Seiya Negami states that these are the only graphs with planar covers., p. 1 The existence of a planar cover is a minor-closed graph property,, Proposition 1, p. 2 and so can be characterized by finitely many forbidden minors, but the exact set of forbidden minors is not known. For the same reason, there exists a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a given graph has a planar cover, but an explicit description of this algorithm is not known. Definition A covering map from one graph C to another graph H may be described by a function f from the vertices of C onto the vertices of H that, for each vertex v of C, gives a bijection between the neighbors of v and the neighbors of f(v)., Definition, p. 2 If H is a connected graph, each vertex of H must have the same number of pre-images in C; this number is called the ply of the map, and C is called a covering graph of G. If C and H are both finite, and C is a planar graph, then C is called a planar cover of H. Examples Identifying pairs of opposite vertices of the dodecahedron gives a covering map to the Petersen graph The graph of the dodecahedron has a symmetry that maps each vertex to the antipodal vertex. The set of antipodal pairs of vertices and their adjacencies can itself be viewed as a graph, the Petersen graph. The dodecahedron forms a planar cover of this nonplanar graph.: \\"This construction is illustrated in Figure 1, where the dodecahedron is shown to be a planar double cover of the Petersen graph.\\" As this example shows, not every graph with a planar cover is itself planar. However, when a planar graph covers a non-planar one, the ply must be an even number.; . The dodecagonal prism can form a 2-ply cover of the hexagonal prism, a 3-ply cover of the cube, or a 4-ply cover of the triangular prism. The graph of a k-gonal prism has 2k vertices, and is planar with two k-gon faces and k quadrilateral faces. If k = ab, with a ‚â• 2 and b ‚â• 3, then it has an a-ply covering map to a b-fonal prism, in which two vertices of the k-prism are mapped to the same vertex of the b-prism if they both belong to the same k-gonal face and the distance from one to the other is a multiple of b. For instance, the dodecagonal prism can form a 2-ply cover of the hexagonal prism, a 3-ply cover of the cube, or a 4-ply cover of the triangular prism. These examples show that a graph may have many different planar covers, and may be the planar cover for many other graphs. Additionally they show that the ply of a planar cover may be arbitrarily large. They are not the only covers involving prisms: for instance, the hexagonal prism can also cover a non-planar graph, the utility graph K3,3, by identifying antipodal pairs of vertices. Cover- preserving operations If a graph H has a planar cover, so does every graph minor of H. A minor G of H may be formed by deleting edges and vertices from H, and by contracting edges of H. The covering graph C can be transformed in the same way: for each deleted edge or vertex in H, delete its preimage in C, and for each contracted edge or vertex in H, contract its preimage in C. The result of applying these operations to C is a minor of C that covers G. Since every minor of a planar graph is itself planar, this gives a planar cover of the minor G. Because the graphs with planar covers are closed under the operation of taking minors, it follows from the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem that they may be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors. A graph is a forbidden minor for this property if it has no planar cover, but all of its minors do have planar covers. This characterization can be used to prove the existence of a polynomial time algorithm that tests for the existence of a planar cover, by searching for each of the forbidden minors and returning that a planar cover exists only if this search fails to find any of them. However, because the exact set of forbidden minors for this property is not known, this proof of existence is non-constructive, and does not lead to an explicit description of the set of forbidden minors or of the algorithm based on them.; . The non-constructivity of algorithmically testing the existence of k-fold planar covers is given explicitly as an example by Fellows and Koblitz. Another graph operation that preserves the existence of a planar cover is the Y-Œî transform, which replaces any degree-three vertex of a graph H by a triangle connecting its three neighbors. However, the reverse of this transformation, a Œî-Y transform, does not necessarily preserve planar covers. Additionally, a disjoint union of two graphs that have covers will also have a cover, formed as the disjoint union of the covering graphs. If the two covers have the same ply as each other, then this will also be the ply of their union. Negami's conjecture If a graph H has an embedding into the projective plane, then it necessarily has a planar cover, given by the preimage of H in the orientable double cover of the projective plane, which is a sphere. proved, conversely, that if a connected graph H has a two-ply planar cover then H must have an embedding into the projective plane.; , Theorem 2, p. 2 The assumption that H is connected is necessary here, because a disjoint union of projective-planar graphs may not itself be projective-planarFor instance, the two Kuratowski graphs are projective-planar but any union of two of them is not . but will still have a planar cover, the disjoint union of the orientable double covers. A regular cover of a graph H is one that comes from a group of symmetries of its covering graph: the preimages of each vertex in H are an orbit of the group. proved that every connected graph with a planar regular cover can be embedded into the projective plane.; , Theorem 3, p. 3 Based on these two results, he conjectured that in fact every connected graph with a planar cover is projective.; , Conjecture 4, p. 4 As of 2013, this conjecture remains unsolved. It is also known as Negami's \\"1-2-‚àû conjecture\\", because it can be reformulated as stating that the minimum ply of a planar cover, if it exists, must be either 1 or 2. K1,2,2,2, the only possible minimal counterexample to Negami's conjecture Like the graphs with planar covers, the graphs with projective plane embeddings can be characterized by forbidden minors. In this case the exact set of forbidden minors is known: there are 35 of them. 32 of these are connected, and one of these 32 graphs necessarily appears as a minor in any connected non-projective-planar graph., p. 4; the list of forbidden projective-planar minors is from . instead stated the corresponding observation for the 103 irreducible non-projective-planar graphs given by . Since Negami made his conjecture, it has been proven that 31 of these 32 forbidden minors either do not have planar covers, or can be reduced by Y-Œî transforms to a simpler graph on this list.; ; ; ; , pp. 4‚Äì6 The one remaining graph for which this has not yet been done is K1,2,2,2, a seven-vertex apex graph that forms the skeleton of a four-dimensional octahedral pyramid. If K1,2,2,2 could be shown not to have any planar covers, this would complete a proof of the conjecture. On the other hand, if the conjecture is false, K1,2,2,2 would necessarily be its smallest counterexample., pp. 6‚Äì9 A related conjecture by Michael Fellows, now solved, concerns planar emulators, a generalization of planar covers that maps graph neighborhoods surjectively rather than bijectively.; ; , Definition, p. 9 The graphs with planar emulators, like those with planar covers, are closed under minors and Y-Œî transforms., Proposition 13, p. 9\\\\. Hlinƒõn√Ω credits this to Fellows and writes that its proof is nontrivial. In 1988, independently of Negami, Fellows conjectured that the graphs with planar emulators are exactly the graphs that can be embedded into the projective plane., Conjecture 14, p. 9 The conjecture is true for regular emulators, coming from automomorphisms of the underlying covering graph, by a result analogous to the result of for regular planar covers.. However, several of the 32 connected forbidden minors for projective-planar graphs turn out to have planar emulators., pp. 9‚Äì10; ; Therefore, Fellows' conjecture is false. Finding a full set of forbidden minors for the existence of planar emulators remains an open problem., p. 10 Notes References =Secondary sources about Negami's conjecture=.

They pledged construction effort to the Japanese government and work began in October 1937. As of March 1940, 32 piers had been completed. However, construction was suspended after the outbreak of war against the United States on 7 December 1941. The Japanese government then moved the materials for the bridge to Hainan, Republic of China. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the Xiluo Bridge Reconstruction Committee was established in 1948. On 26 January 1950, personnel from Taiwan Provincial Government, legislators, engineers of Economic Cooperation Administration, Council for United States (US) Aids conducted a site survey. In 1951, the US Government spent US$1.3 million for the steel material and the Taiwan Provincial Government also provided NT$6 million for the project. The Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corporation and the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs were in charge of the bridge erection and painting projects respectively. The construction of the bridge resumed on 28 May 1952 and completed on 25 December the same year. The inauguration ceremony of the bridge was held on 24 January 1953.

The Redlegs stood third with two games remaining but lost a decisive match to Subiaco, who played open-age finals for the first time in a decade, in spite of being very weak in attack and the failure of their protest against Townsend. Swan Districts, a finalist in 1945, fell to second-last and began its bleakest period on record: until Haydn Bunton, Jr. joined the club in 1961 Swans were never to win more than seven games in a season and did not finish above any rival except Subiaco or Claremont. The Swans did, however, win their first title of any kind in the lower grade. Despite the return of Bernie Naylor, who went far beyond his 1941 promise with 131 goals, South Fremantle fell to fourth owing to injuries and business commitments ‚Äì one of which caused their coach to resign while their form was at its best.

Having directed a few films earlier, Chopra formed his own production house B.R. Films in 1955 and Ek Hi Raasta was the first film produced under this banner. The film was remade in Telugu as Kumkuma Rekha (1960) and in Tamil as Pudhiya Pathai also released in 1960.  Plot  The film starts with the portrayal of happily married couple, Amar (Sunil Dutt) and Malti (Meena Kumari) who have a son named Raja (Daisy Irani). Amar and Malti are both orphans and hence are sympathetic towards orphans generally. Prakash (Ashok Kumar) is a rich bachelor businessman for whom Amar works. While working in Prakash's factory, Amar catches another worker Munshi (Jeevan) stealing money from the factory locker. To take revenge for his humiliation at the hands of Amar, Munshi murders him.

History Airwolf was founded in May 2012 by Erick Wolf, a patent attorney with a mechanical engineering degree, and his wife Eva. The inspiration for the company reportedly came from a 3D printer that Erick, also a garage mechanic, bought just before Christmas 2011. After encountering difficulty with his goal of getting the printer to print replacement parts for itself, he spent several days working on the printer before determining that it wasn't able to complete the task. The printer was eventually scrapped for parts, and Erick instead began building his own printer, which was named the Airwolf 3D. The original Airwolf printer (v.4) was derived from the Prusa Mendel and Mecano Air designs, hence the name \\"Airwolf.\\" The company started shipping fully assembled 3D printers in June 2012 from their garage in Newport Beach, California. The first printer was sold to Lars Brubaker and Kevin Pope of MatterHackers. MatterHackers went on to develop MatterControl, 3D printing software that works with many 3D printers and is offered in a customized version for Airwolf 3D. Airwolf's technicians use 3D printers to replicate more 3D printers nearly 24/7 at the company's headquarters in Costa Mesa, California.

As the word \\"Hottentot\\" is an offensive term for the Khoisan people, there are calls to re-evaluate the English name of this bird. Fynbos buttonquail would be a suitable alternative name for this habitat specialist. Range The species is endemic to South Africa and is found along the south coast from Cape town to Algoa Bay in Eastern Cape province. There are no subspecies. Population A 1994 survey resulted in an estimate of c.310-420 birds in of montane fynbos habitat in Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. The lack of records suggest that this may be an overestimate, and extrapolation of a much lower density estimate from a 1990 study would result in a total population across the Western Cape of just 400 birds (Lee 2013). The total population is therefore uncertain, but given the lack of recent records is assumed to be very small.

India discussed Musan Cho Oh Hyun and Ethics Education. He revealed that Musan Cho Oh Hyun‚Äôs approach to ethics education is humanistic. His teachings import the carriage of leading a life worthy of a human being. While embodying the transcendental ethics of Seon Buddhism, Musan teaches that in order to lead a truly human life, it is paramount for all mortals to respect the collective rules of communities. In his exposition of the Buddhist ethics, Musan shows a supple understanding that goes beyond Sila and Vinaya, the rules of daily Buddhist lives.

The work was written from 1889 to 1890.  Background  The creative life of Franck is broadly divided into three periods. During the first period (1841‚Äì1858), when his ambitious father forced him to be active as a virtuoso pianist, Franck wrote works for chamber music, including four piano trios numbered as the composer's Opp. 1 and 2. Franck received advice from Franz Liszt, who commented, about 40 years later, on hearing an organ performance by Franck at Sainte-Clotilde, Paris, \\"How could I ever forget the composer of those trios?\\" However, during the second period (1858‚Äì1876), when Franck dedicated himself to the organ, he did not compose any notable works for this genre. Franck‚Äôs masterpieces, including the Piano Quintet F minor (1879), the Violin Sonata A major (1886), and this quartet, were written in the third period (1876‚Äì1890). Since his next chamber work, the second violin sonata, was unfinished at the time of his death in 1890, this string quartet is his last completed chamber work. Franck started a sketch of this work at the beginning of 1889. He commenced with the first movement, and, through at least three different versions, completed the final version of it on October 29. After quickly finishing the second movement by November 9, he completed the entire work on January 15, 1890. Vincent d'Indy, one of Franck's celebrated pupils, noted (in the detailed analysis he includes in his biography of the master) that Franck had already considered writing a string quartet as early as the 1870s. It was in the 1870s that the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, which Franck joined as one of the founding members, was established in order to promote the French classical music tradition instead of stage music; it dominated the country's music scene at that time under influential musicians including Jacques Offenbach. Although Franck abandoned his string quartet, he resumed in 1888, and, as d'Indy recalled, he learned the scores of string quartets by Beethoven and Schubert on his piano for intensive study. Many elements of Franck's string quartet are considered to stem from Beethoven's later works, but traces of Beethoven are not superficially visible. The String Quartet was Franck‚Äôs first public success during his life. Franck, known as a late- flowering composer, had attracted little attention from audiences. Even the Symphony D minor and the Pr√©lude, Aria et Final, whose reputation is well established today, were disastrously premiered. However, he never pandered to the French public taste of the day and never ceased pursuing his ideal of music, gradually attracting interest from the public as well as professionals through masterpieces such as his violin sonata. Finally, on 19 April 1890, in the concert of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique at Salle Pleyel, the premiere of this work was received with thunderous applause. This was just seven months before his death. The score of this work was published in 1892, and the edition by Hamelle, Paris, was widely used in 1906.  Structure  This work consists of four movements, which are tightly united by cyclic form. A complete performance lasts approximately 50 minutes. = First movement = Poco lento - Allegro 4/4 D major This movement, written in unusual sonata form combined with ternary form, begins with a large introduction, which d'Indy calls the Lied (song) and also L'id√©e m√®re (fundamental or generative idea). The first violin plays the main theme of the introduction over the harmonic accompaniment of strings (Excerpt 1). This subject will appear in this and later movements as the first cyclic theme. The introduction comprises Excerpt 1 and Excerpt 2, which is played quietly in contrast. A stepwise-falling dotted rhythm, suggested at the very end of the introduction, leads into the main part of sonata form in D minor starting with exposition of first subject (Excerpt 3). Excerpt 4, played by cello during an energetic transition, will play an important role in the finale as the second cyclic theme. Excerpt 4 is also played by violin. The passionate climax is smoothly connected to the exposition of the second subject, in F major, which appeared in dialogue between the first violin and viola (Excerpt 5). The next climax calms down with a codetta using Excerpt 3, which closes the exposition. In the development section, Poco Lento, the viola starts a fugue based on Excerpt 1, followed by second violin, cello, and then first violin. A conventional development of the first subject (Excerpt 3), again Allegro, comes after the emotional end of the fugue. The development also includes Excerpts 4, 5 and many other materials. The reappearance of the first subject in D minor proclaims the opening of the recapitulation, followed by Excerpt 4. The second subject begins in B major, but, just four bars later, modulates into D major, which leads to the reappearance of the introductory Lied (Poco Lento), in the same tonality. Echoes of Excerpt 3, following Excerpt 1 and 2, conclude the movement. = Second movement = Scherzo: Vivace 3/8 F-sharp minor The second movement is coloured by Mendelssohnian lightness. Impressive ascending repeated notes, as shown in Excerpt 6, open the movement‚Äôs F-sharp minor scherzo. Effective frequent tacet insertions are observed here. Another main subject, Excerpt 7, is played by first violin in contrasting fluent manner. The D minor trio, based on Excerpt 8, is also interrupted by whole rests elongated with fermata. In the middle of the trio, the cello covertly plays Excerpt 1. Afterwards, the Scherzo returns (Excerpt 6), now with pizzicato bars plugging the original silent bars, and is soon bridged to Excerpt 7. The movement ends with a quiet pizzicato coda featuring Excerpt 8. This is the shortest and most immediately accessible of the quartet's movements: imitated for example by Frank Bridge in the second of his three Novelletten just a few years later (1904). = Third movement = Larghetto 3/4 B major The structure of the third movement is close to ternary form. The lyrical opening theme, Excerpt 9, is supposed to have originated from Excerpts 1 and 4. The first part of this movement is in ternary form itself, and Excerpt 9 reappears after the exposition of Excerpt 10. In the second part of this movement, a passionate melody is exhibited by the first violin over the accompaniment of extended arpeggios (Excerpt 11). That melody has already appeared in the middle voice during the exposition of Excerpt 10. Repeated modulation prevents an obvious determination of tonality, though the key signature is C major. After the climax of the middle part, Excerpt 9 is recapitulated in ppp. This third part is not a simple reemerging of the first part; it is rather shortened and it includes elements of the second part in Poco Animato. Finally, Excerpt 10 quietly closes the movement. = Fourth movement = Finale: Allegro molto 2/2 D major The finale is in extended sonata form. It begins with a strong declamatory unison phrase (Excerpt 12), whose argument continues like a 'window frame' between the panes of the main subjects from the previous three movements: Excerpt 9 from the third movement, Excerpt 6 from the second movement, and Excerpt 1 from the first movement. This 'summary' is similar to the finale from Beethoven's ninth symphony; Franck himself had used the same method in his organ piece Grande Pi√®ce Symphonique. Since the three main subjects contrast strongly (in different ways) with their frame, one might also think of the second movement of Beethoven's 4th piano concerto with its dialogue between 'angry' orchestra and 'pacifying' piano, which had previously inspired the opening of Franck's 'Symphonic Variations' for piano and orchestra. After the introduction, the main subjects are exposed. The first subject (Excerpt 13), exposed on viola, is induced from Excerpt 1. Following a brief conclusion with a fragment of Excerpt 12, a series of second subjects appear: Excerpt 14, which is a transformation of Excerpt 4; Excerpt 15, played with rigorous accompaniment of Excerpt 12; and the encouraging Excerpt 16. In the development, Franck combines the major subjects in counterpoint. Excerpt 1 is added and Excerpt 12 repeatedly appears to change the atmosphere. Although the beginning of the recapitulation is not clear, the second reappearance of the first subject, at approximately bar 500, is followed by the second subjects. At the end of the recapitulation, Excerpt 6 suddenly emerges from silence. This marks the advent of the coda, where Excerpt 6 dominates in counterpoint with Excerpt 13. At the final climax, Excerpt 9 is sung dramatically in augmentation. Contained emotion after the climax turns into Excerpt 12, in Presto, which rushes into the conclusion.

It was built during the 1930s along Escolta Street, part of the city's primary commercial district, together with the Lyric Theater. It was designed with a double-balcony by National Artist Juan Nakpil and was considered a rare feat during that era.  Architecture  A decorative located over the main building entrance, was intentionally designed to be different from the rest of the building. The tower facade is symmetrically composed with lines offsetting each other to emphasize the strong and rigid geometric forms; this is most especially shown at the top, with recessed tiers resembling a ziggurat and the geometric details at the top corners. At the center of this is an art deco grillework that is made up of squares and circles surrounded by two pilasters on both sides. Both of the vertical surfaces have low-relief figures depicting two Filipina muses which are portrayed wearing native dress or 'traje de mestizas' and local fauna which include carabao head. This was done by Francesco Riccardo Monti, also known for his works in some of the famous buildings in Metro Manila. Strong lines and soft curves outline the pleats of the gowns worn by the muses. To represent its use as a theater, both muses each hold a mask and a lyre, associated with theater arts and music, respectively. The external elements found in the building relate to the function of the structure as a cinema and the Art Deco style with its strong geometric forms. Crowning the top of the central tower is the world \\"Capitol,\\" the name of the structure in concrete. Due to natural and human-caused damage, only the I and T remain. The national flower, sampaguita was the underlying motif of the interior spaces shown in wrought-iron grills on the stairs, the lobby, the foyer and the proscenium arch. Also found in its lobby is a mural entitled \\"Rising Philippines\\" done by Victorio C. Edades, Carlos V. Francisco and Galo B. Ocampo. The theme also is evident in the proscenium arch, featuring sampaguita flowers in bloom finished in white seashell. Four concentric circles of short bamboo nodes and internodes radiate from the sampaguita flowers. The theater accommodates 1,100 seats in its air- conditioned double-balcony interior.  Damage and decay  The theater closed because of the declining theater business in Manila. The beginning of the Light Rail Transit (LRT) construction caused the theater-goers to choose cinema theaters inside the newly opened air-conditioned malls.  Demolition  The theater was being demolished on June 2020 to make way a new high-rise buidling.

Under communist rule Poland officially had close to full employment, although hidden unemployment existed. After Poland's transition to a market economy the unemployment rate sharply increased, peaking at above 16% in 1993, then dropped afterwards, but remained well above pre-1993 levels.Unemployment rate 1990‚Äì2016 (en) Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS) Retrieved 27 February 2016. Another period of high unemployment occurred in the early 2000s when the rate reached 20%. As Poland entered the European Union (EU) and its job market in 2004, the high unemployment set off a wave of emigration, and as a result domestic unemployment started a downward trend Dekada cz≈Çonkostwa Polski w UE ‚Äì korzy≈õci czy straty dla polskiego rynku pracy?

Recent years have seen an increase in the unemployment rate from below 8% to above 10% (Eurostat) or from below 10% to 13% (GUS). The rate began dropping again in late 2013. Polish government (GUS) reported 9.6% registered unemployment in November 2015, while European Union's Eurostat gave 7.2%. According to Eurostat data, since 2008, unemployment in Poland has been constantly below the EU average. Significant regional differences in the unemployment rate exist across Poland. Definition and measurement Unemployment rates in Poland and EU28 and EU18 (Eurostat) Unemployment rates are reported by the Polish Central Statistical Office, and the European Union's Eurostat office.For methodology of Eurostat, see . For GUS, see . The difference in the reported statistics is due to adjustments that Eurostat makes to make the unemployment rate comparable across countries in Europe. The unemployment rate as reported by GUS is defined as percent of those without work out of the economically active population. To be counted as unemployed a person has to fulfill four criteria: 1) be between 17 and 74 years of age, 2) be out of work, 3) have actively sought unemployment in the past four weeks, and 4) were ready to take employment within a short period if offered. Additionally, the rate counts as unemployed those who have been hired for a job but have not yet started active work. Eurostat uses the same harmonized definition of unemployment for all countries in the EU, based on the definition of the International Labour Organization.Europe in figures ‚Äî Eurostat yearbook 2010, PDF file. This definition is similar to the one used by GUS but considers people between 15 and 74, rather than 17 and 74, years of age, and counts the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. History Unemployment rate in Poland from January 2003 to January 2019 (GUS) Unemployment originated in Poland in the late 19th century, and appeared as a result of industrialization. In Russian-ruled Congress Poland, the 1904 onset of war with Japan caused a depression that deepened with the following year's revolution. Meanwhile, efforts by the government to shift industry to Russia proper led to long-term industrial recession. Massive unemployment of factory workers ensued, in turn prompting both urban and rural Poles to emigrate. In the Second Polish Republic (1918‚Äì1939), unemployment was among the worst problems of the economy, particularly during the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1934). The number of registered unemployed jumped from 185,000 in 1928 to 466,000 in 1936; in 1932, there were 240,000 unemployed industrial workers, or one-third of the total in that field. Not only industrial workers but also members of the intelligentsia were affected. Official statistics for the period only account for non-farm wage and salary earners who registered as unemployed with a labor exchange. Thus, government data account for just part of the actual number of jobless. One scholar calculated a non-farm wage-earner unemployment rate of 13% for 1929 and 25% for 1931, estimating a \\"substantially higher\\" figure for 1938, given natural increase in the urban population and migration from rural areas. The Polish People's Republic (1945-1989) was officially characterized by nearly full employment, not accounting for unofficial hidden unemployment. Following Poland's transformation from a communist to capitalist economy after the Revolutions of 1989, unemployment sharply increased from the officially reported 0% to 6.5% in 1990, peaking at 16.4% at 1993, and then decreasing to about 10.3% in 1997. The unemployment rate then begun rising again until 2002, reaching a zenith of almost 20% around that time. As Poland entered European Union in 2004 and its job market, mass emigration due to unemployment took place lowering the figure. It has dropped to 8.9% in September 2008, but then started rising again, reaching about 13% in the years 2012‚Äì2014. The unemployment raise in the late 2000s and early 2010s has been attributed to the global recession in that period. As of February 2019, Poland's unemployment rate has been reported as 6,1% (GUS)https://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/5473/2/79/1/bezrobotni_zarejestrowani_i_stopa_bezrobocia._stan_w_koncu_lutego_2019_r..xlsx and 3,4% (European Central Bank, Eurostat)http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=132.STS.M.PL.S.UNEH.RTT000.4.000, and has been steadily decreasing over the years from the previous high of c. 20% in the early 2000s. Mainly from 2015 onwards, the improved economy and drastic drop in joblessness statewide, causes a serious problem of a labour shortage. The labor force shortage has become a permanent problem in Poland, and it‚Äôs increasingly weighing on the future performance of the Polish economy.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-26/incredible- shrinking-workforce-adds-strain-to-polish-labor-pinch Due to significant worker shortages, in cooperation with a private companies, the Polish government allows for convicted prisoners to be employed.https://www.ft.com/content/c4c4a146-974d-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229 Since 2015, around two million Ukrainians were granted Polish work permits.https://www.neweurope.eu/article/labour-market-shortages-take-their- toll-on-central-eastern-european- economies/https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-two-faced-immigration- strategy-ukraine-migrants/ Regional distribution Unemployment rate in major Polish cities and metropolitan areas for 2016 One of the characteristics of Poland's unemployment is difference between regions, with the eastern regions being seen as usually worse affected. However, data do not show a clear correlation with the Poland A and B (\\"rich west\\" vs \\"poor east\\") division. In May 2019, the highest unemployment rates were reported by the northeast Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (9.2%), northcentral Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship (8.1%) and southeast Podkarpackie Voivodeship (8.1%). Lowest unemployment rate was reported by the central-west Greater Poland Voivodeship (2.9%), the southern Silesian Voivodeship (4.0%) and Lesser Poland Voivodeship (4.4%). The 2019 statistics show the lowest recorded statewide, regional unemployment since 1990.https://www.forbes.pl/gospodarka/bezrobocie- w-maju-spadlo-do-54-proc-dane-gus/6gcryd8 Reasons and consequences The global Great Recession following in the wake of the international financial crisis of 2008 has contributed to the rise of unemployment in Poland. Domestically, one of the elements behind high unemployment are inefficient labor laws making job creation difficult, and unduly protecting senior employees (aged over 56). Entrenched structural unemployment is especially problematic in Poland, with 46% of the jobless being long term unemployed as of 2013. A 2011 report reported a 3.6% figure for the long-term unemployment for that year's total unemployment rate of 3.6% Another problem is related to certain forms of temporary contracts, known as \\"junk contracts\\" () which allow employees to bypass labor laws, offer substandard wages, and little or no stability or social security. In 2010 it was estimated that as many as 27% of those employed in Poland may be working on short-term \\"junk contracts\\". Unemployment in Poland is higher among the youth. It has risen to over 25% in 2011 and as of March 2014 is at 26.3%, and is higher than the OECD average of 16.3%. One of the consequences of unemployment being particularly high among the young has been a relatively high rate of youth emigration to other European countries, estimated in 2014 as 2 million (out of Poland's approximately 40 million population). Unemployment remains one of the most serious issues facing the Polish economy. The unemployed are a group at particular risk of being affected by poverty (see poverty in Poland). According to the OECD, during the 2007-2011 global financial crisis the unemployment rate in Poland decreased by almost 3%, with long term unemployment falling by 1% (for 2007-2012). 18% of workers in Poland stated that they worked in a \\"poor working environment\\", a percentage which was a bit below the European average. \\"How's life in Poland\\" OECD, oecd.org. High unemployment and significant risk of becoming unemployed are quoted by OECD as one of the reasons for Poland having one of the worst working conditions among OECD countries, placing it only ahead of Turkey and Mexico.Warunki pracy w Polsce jednymi z najgorszych w≈õr√≥d rozwiniƒôtych pa≈Ñstw Wprost 2014-10-23 In terms of unemployment risk among OECD countries, Poland was comparable to the United States, and ahead of Turkey, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, Ireland, Greece and Spain, but below most northwestern European countries, as well as Australia, Japan and South Korea.OECD Employment Outlook, pg 95. Unemployment benefits To get unemployment benefits in Poland, one has to register with the appropriate government office and demonstrate \\"the lack of the possibility to be employed or to be professionally activated within the field of activities proposed by the said office, have worked for a total of at least 365 days in the period of 18 months before registering with the said government office.\\" In March 2014 it was reported that 13.6% of the registered unemployed were eligible for the unemployment benefits.

Bases  The main starting point for ascents is the village of Hinterhornbach in a side valley of the Tyrolean Lechtal. From there it is roughly 2¬Ω hours to the Kaufbeurer Haus, a self-service hut belonging to the DAV. The hut is regularly manned at weekends from Pentecost to early October but is otherwise only open to members of the Alpine Club with a key.  Ascent  There is no simple way leading to the summit of the Urbeleskarspitze. The two usable routes from the Kaufbeurer Haus require sure-footedness, a head for heights and Alpine experience and climbing preparedness. The only partially marked normal route is graded as UIAA II+ and takes just under 2 hours through steep schrofen terrain over the northwest flank to reach the top. An alternative climb existed over the north ar√™te. It was a UIAA grade II and ran through broken rock, also taking 2 hours to reach the summit of the Urbeleskarspitze.

It is an artificial lake, inaugurated in 1987 with the construction of Rajjaprabha Dam by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) as a source of electricity. Rajjaprabha Dam Rajjaprabha Dam, meaning 'light of the kingdom', got its name in May 1987 from the king at the opening ceremony on the king's 60th birthday. Before that day it was called the \\"Cheow Lan Project\\". It was designed as a multi-purpose project for power generation, flood control, irrigation, and fishery. In 1982, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) started construction of the dam by diverting the Klong Saeng River. It took about one year to completely flood the basin. To flood this large area, 385 families of Ban Chiew Lan village were resettled. Rubber and other farming opportunities such as poultry, fruit orchards, vegetable farming, and reservoir fisheries were introduced together with the needed training programs and credit facilities to sustain farmers' incomes. Each family received 19 rai (7.2 acres) of rubber plantation as well as one rai (0.39 acres) for their dwelling. As part of the compensation, the resettled people received 1,000 baht monthly per family. Resettlement drove the creation of basic public infrastructure, water supply systems, and public buildings such as schools, police station, medical center, and community hall‚Äîall built by the Thai government. A resettlement of animals took place by boat and helicopter to prevent them from drowning or starving on new created islands. In 18 months 1,364 animals of 116 species were rescued, but 44 died soon after. Many fish species died due to the stagnant water conditions. Tourism The national park area is inhabited by a range of mammals such as tigers, elephants, tapirs and many monkey species. Birds such as hornbills, banded pittas, and great argus are as well forest residents. Less commonly seen reptiles include the king cobra, reticulated python, and flying lizards. The reservoir area includes the Khlong Saeng, Khlong Nakha and Kaeng Krung wildlife sanctuaries where rare animals can be found. West of Khao Sok National Park lies Sri Phang Nga National Park which extends the preservation area to 4,000 square kilometers.

Russische Kunst Heute, Cologne 2004 . Their motifs are mostly festivities, pageants, parties, and social and political events.. In a 2013/14 series they covered the carnival in Brasil (\\"Samb√≥dromo\\"). Technically R√∂mer + R√∂mer set out from self-taken photographs which are subjected to image processing, the computer taking the traditional role of the sketchbook. The pictorial idea finds its artistic form in paintings showing a pixel-structure. The pixels, however, are different from digital pixels as they possess inner structures. This way R√∂mer + R√∂mer's art is related to Pointillism, and one may also see references to stipple engraving. The motifs are distributed over planes of colour and fragmented into thousands of painted dots, which, seen from a certain distance, merge in the eye of the beholder to form a focussed image. The closer one comes to the canvas, the more the figures and objects dissolve into an abstract and dynamic interplay of colours.Cfr.

A normal route or normal way (; ) is the most frequently used route for ascending and descending a mountain peak. It is usually the simplest route.The Mountain Encyclopedia\\" by Frederic Hartemann and Robert Hauptman (2005). Accessed on 1 Jun 2014. In the Alps, routes are classed in the following ways, based on their waymarking, construction and upkeep: *Footpaths (Fu√üwege) *Hiking trails (Wanderwege) *Mountain trails (Bergwege) *Alpine routes (Alpine Routen) *Climbing routes (Kletterrouten) and High Alpine routes (Hochalpine Routen) in combined rock and ice terrain, (UIAA) graded by difficulty Sometimes the normal route is not the easiest ascent to the summit, but just the one that is most used. There may be technically easier variations. This is especially the case on the Watzmannfrau, the Hochkalter and also Mount Everest. There may be many reasons these easier options are less well-used: * the simplest route is less well known than the normal route (Watzmannfrau). * the technically easiest route is more arduous than another (e.g. due to rubble) and is therefore mainly used on the descent (Hochkalter). * the technically easiest route carries a much higher risk of e.g. rockfalls or avalanche and is therefore avoided in favour of a more difficult route (Watzespitze). * the technically easier route requires a complicated or long approach march, or all access may be banned via one country (Mount Everest). The term tourist route may sometimes be applied (irrespective of the level of difficulty of ascent) by those wishing to suggest that other routes up a mountain are somehow more \\"worthy\\". This belittling of the \\"normal route\\" therefore maintains a distinction between those perceiving themselves as serious mountaineers who disparage the incursion of tourist climbers into their domain (hence the term the \\"Yak Route\\" on Mount Everest).

She grew up in Stewart County, Georgia and married Jonathan Windsor in 1845; after Windsor's death six years later, she married John Pryor Durham, a physician, in 1854. Cassandra Durham would often accompany her second husband when he tended to patients, and together they had four children. After her husband died in 1869, she sent her children to live with relatives and moved to Macon, Georgia to attend its Reform Medical College. After graduating from the Reform Medical College, Durham became the first woman in the state of Georgia to have earned a degree in medicine. She moved to Americus, Georgia and took up eclectic medicine, gathering and preparing medicinal herbs herself. In 1871, a local newspaper in Americus referred to her as a \\"Doctress in Medicine\\" and \\"a professional acquisition to the city\\". She practiced in Americus for over 15 years, and although some male doctors objected to her practice, she built a successful patient base in and around Americus. A local journalist wrote at the time that Durham \\"has as good a knowledge of medicine as most of the gentlemen who practice. She commands the respect of every gentleman and lady of this section and is doing good business.\\" Durham died suddenly in 1885 when she developed acute apoplexy while treating a patient. Legacy After Durham's death, four successive generations of her family continued the practice of medicine. She was inducted into the list of Georgia Women of Achievement in 1993.

The TJC is currently one of the largest Christian groups in China and Taiwan, as well as one of the largest independent churches in the world. History The TJC emerged independently alongside other indigenous Christian groups of that period such as the Little Flock, the Jesus Family and The Christian Tabernacle. Established in 1917, the church‚Äôs early adherents in Hebei and Shandong were influenced by certain charismatic practices of the Apostolic Faith Mission in China, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, especially faith healing, baptism of the Holy Spirit, footwashing, and Sabbath keeping. The TJC was founded by Paul Wei (Wei Enbo, 1877-1919) in 1917. quoted in Refugee Review Tribunal A former member of the Beijing branch of the London Missionary Society led by British missionary Samuel Evans Meech (1845‚Äì1937), Wei became a Pentecostal under the influence of Norwegian missionary to China, Bernt Berntsen. In 1917, he left Berntsen‚Äôs group and claimed that a vision had directed him to found his own church. Wei predicted that the world will end in 1921 or 1922. He died of tuberculosis on September 10, 1919, and the failure of his prophecy did not prevent the further growth of the TJC.Melissa Wei-Tsing Inouye, China and the True Jesus: Charisma and Organization in a Chinese Christian Church, New York: Oxford University Press, 2018, 86‚Äì118. The TJC‚Äôs early leaders included Zhang Lingsheng (1863‚Äî?), who convinced Wei that the church should maintain a seventh-day Sabbath, and Barnabas Zhang (1882‚Äì1961), who eventually left the group in 1929 and established a rival movement in Hong Kong. In Mainland China, Wei‚Äôs son, Wei Wenxiang (È≠èÊñáÁ••, Isaac Wei, È≠è‰ª•Êíí, ca. 1900-?), emerged as the main leader of the TJC. He also presided over TJC‚Äôs international expansion to various countries and the establishment of an effective bureaucracy.Inouye (2018), 157‚Äì185. By 1949, the membership grew to around 120,000 in seven hundred churches. In 1951, Isaac Wei was arrested and ‚Äúdisappeared.‚Äù How and when he died is unknown. Li Zhengcheng (ÊùéÊ≠£Ë™†, ca.1920-1990) replaced Isaac Wei as the main leader of the TJC and lead it into joining the Three-Self Patriotic Movement as the government had requested. Scholar Melissa Inouye reports that, fearing persecution, the leaders mourned the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 claiming that he was now in Heaven. One even stated that ‚ÄúComrade Stalin has saved many tens of thousands of people, more than Jesus.‚Äù Persecution, however, came, both before and during the Cultural Revolution Li Zhengcheng spent more than twenty years in jail. Because of the developments in China, the TJC abroad proclaimed its autonomy, with headquarters first in Taiwan and from 1985 in the U.S. The Chinese branch was however reconstituted, as part of the Three-Self Church, after the Cultural Revolution and the reforms of Deng Xiaoping and still has a substantial following in China.Inouye (2018), 187‚Äì259. Today there are officially 1.5 million members in fifty eight countries. Current organization =Mainland China= In mainland China most of the True Jesus Church congregations are members of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and usually meet on Saturdays in TSPM church buildings as separate sabbatarian sub-congregations. However, since TJC practices such as healing and tongues are \\"frowned upon\\" in the TSPM other congregations are independent Chinese house churches. =Taiwan and the United States= Outside China member churches of the TJC look to the central synod of the TJC in California. In 1967 TJC church leaders from outside mainland China met for the first World Delegates Conference in Taiwan, and an international headquarters was established in Taichung, Taiwan, where a seminary was opened. The headquarters was subsequently moved to California in 1985. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, True Jesus Church congregations were established as a result of immigration patterns in the 1960s and 1970s, coming largely from Malaysia and Hong Kong, the latter especially from Ap Chau. This would result in a number of congregations being established throughout the country, particularly in Northern England and Scotland, such as Leicester, Newcastle, Sunderland, Elgin, Edinburgh and Cardiff. Beliefs { # Jesus Christ, the Word who became flesh, died on the cross for the redemption of sinners, resurrected on the third day, and ascended to heaven. He is the only Savior of mankind, the Creator of the heavens and earth, and the only true God. # The Holy Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is inspired by God, the only scriptural truth, and the standard for Christian living. # The True Jesus Church, established by Lord Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit during the time of the 'latter rain', is the restored true church of the apostolic time. # Water baptism is the sacrament for the remission of sins for regeneration. The baptism must take place in natural living water, such as the river, sea, or spring. The Baptist, who already has had received baptism of water and the Holy Spirit, conducts the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The person being baptised must be completely immersed in water with head bowed and face downward. # Receiving the Holy Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues, is the guarantee of inheritance of the kingdom of heaven. # The sacrament of footwashing enables one to have a part with the Lord Jesus. It also serves as a constant reminder that one should have love, holiness, humility, forgiveness, and service. Every person who has received water baptism must have his/her feet washed in the name of Jesus Christ. Mutual footwashing may be practiced whenever is appropriate. # The Holy Communion is the sacrament to commemorate the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. It enables members to partake of the flesh and blood of our Lord and to be in communion with Him so that they can have eternal life and be raised on the last day. This sacrament shall be held as often as possible. Only one unleavened bread and grape juice shall be used. # The Sabbath day, the seventh day of the week (Saturday), is a holy day, blessed and sanctified by God. It is to be observed under the Lord's grace for the commemoration of God's creation and salvation, and with the hope of eternal rest in the life to come. # Salvation is given by the grace of God through faith. Believers must rely on the Holy Spirit to pursue holiness, to honor God, and to love humanity. # The Lord's Second Coming will take place on the last day when He descends from heaven to judge the world: the righteous will receive eternal life, while the wicked will be eternally condemned. } =Practices= The church practices baptism via full body immersion for both adults and infants, with holy communion. Speaking in tongues is practiced and usually occurs while in prayer. The church believes that the sacraments must fulfil three requirements according to the Scripture. Firstly, they must have been performed by Jesus Christ himself as an example. Secondly, the sacraments must be directly related to one's salvation, eternal life, entering the Heavenly Kingdom, and having a part with Jesus. Lastly, they must be of the sacraments which Jesus Christ instructed the disciples to perform as well. There are ten articles of faith that the True Jesus Church holds in order to worship God correctly. According to them, one must speak in tongues as evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. The mode of baptism also determines salvation. The correct mode should be with the head facing down (in the manner of Jesus' death) and only in natural (\\"living\\") water.

Geography  The Hornbach chain branches at the √ñfnerspitze from the main line of the Allg√§u Alps and runs in a gentle arc from north to east. In the far west, it branches at the Hornbachspitze and a side ridge runs southwards in which the most important peak of the whole chain, the Gro√üer Krottenkopf (2,656 m) is located. The mountain is also the highest in the whole of the Allg√§u Alps. In the west the range is bounded along this side branch by a line that reaches from Holzgau in the south, runs along the H√∂henbachtal and Rossgumpental valleys to the √ñfnerkar in the north. The boundaries of the main ridge of the Hornbach chain are formed in the north by the Hornbachtal valley with its settlement of Hinterhornbach, in the south by the Lechtal from Holzgau to Vorderhornbach, where it unites with the Hornbachtal.

Career outside cricket Hammond was a grandson of Charles Hammond (1749‚Äì1837) who founded a bank in Newmarket (taken over by Barclays Bank in 1905). He was educated at Uppingham School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. On graduation, he was ordained as a Church of England priest and from 1867 to his death he was the rector of Herringswell in Suffolk. Shortly after his installation at Herringswell, and soon after a minor church renovation at St Ethelbert's Church, which was of 11th century origin, the thatched roof of the church caught fire during a Sunday morning service and the entire building was destroyed apart from the outer walls and the tower; contemporary reports note that the rector supervised the rescue of the church organ which he had himself donated. Hammond organised the rebuilding and engaged the services of the distinguished London architect Arthur Blomfield.

She was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with no prospect of parole after being convicted of killing two men, Kenneth Countie and Michael DeLoge, in Epping, New Hampshire. At the time of the crimes, LaBarre lived in Epping, New Hampshire (Rockingham County) on a farm. She regularly enticed younger men to her farm, where she would torture and control them. At her trial she claimed she was an angel, sent by God to punish pedophiles. She accused the two men she killed of being pedophiles. Biography LaBarre was born Sheila Kaye Bailey in Alabama in 1958. She has a sister, Lynn Noojin. She graduated from Fort Payne High School in 1976. After marrying Ronnie Jennings, she was known as Sheila Bailey Jennings. She wanted to divorce Ronnie but he refused to divorce her for some time. In the early 1980s, LaBarre was held in a psychiatric facility after attempting suicide; at the facility she was sexually assaulted by an orderly. She married John Baxter in January 1981. LaBarre moved from Fort Payne to Epping, New Hampshire in 1987 after answering a personal ad placed by Wilfred \\"Bill\\" LaBarre, a chiropractor. She never legally married Bill LaBarre, but took his last name (\\"Sheila LaBarre\\") and they lived together from 1987 until his death at age 74 in 2000. Bill LaBarre had been married twice before. However, LaBarre married a Jamaican citizen named Wayne Ennis in York, Maine, on August 22, 1995. LaBarre divorced Ennis in 1996. In April 1997, Sheila LaBarre got a restraining order against Ennis after he had repeatedly assaulted her. After Bill's death, Sheila LaBarre inherited his farm. She said she was his common- law wife. His children from a previous relationship attempted to contest the will to get money and property, but were informed they had a 50/50 chance of success and would have to pay $50,000 upfront. After LaBarre's arrest there was speculation that she may have killed Bill, an allegation which LaBarre has denied. Crimes =Kenny Countie= Kenny Countie met LaBarre via a personal ad in 2006 when he was 24. He moved in with her shortly after meeting her. Countie was described as having a low IQ and \\"child like\\" trust. LaBarre made a recording of him vomiting whilst she accused him of being a pedophile. She stabbed him to death and then burnt his body. The police were able to identify his DNA from his army records. Countie's mother subsequently accused the Epping Police Department of negligence. Prior to his death, he had been seen in a Walmart store, bruised and burned, in a wheelchair. Her lawsuit against the two police officers who had seen him in the store was rejected in 2010. =Michael Deloge= Deloge was LaBarre's boyfriend, who lived with her at her farm. He was last seen alive in 2005. A bone, a spent shell casing and his birth certificate were found in the septic tank of the farm in 2008. It is unknown how he died. His mother informed the police that she was worried LaBarre was trying to kill him. =Arrest= An arrest warrant was issued on April 1, 2006 for Shelia LaBarre, for charges of first degree murder. She was arrested on April 2, and the police conducted a three-week search of her farm, which led to the discovery of three human toes which forensic analysis determined did not belong to either Kenny Countie or Michael Deloge. =Trial= The jury visited LaBarre's farm and the Walmart where she was seen with Countie. LaBarre attended too, wearing a stun belt. LaBarre pleaded not guilty to murdering Countie and Deloge on the grounds of insanity. Her defense attorney described her as a \\"deeply, deeply sick individual\\". At trial in May 2008, psychiatrists testified that LaBarre was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. James Brackett testified in court that he was in an abusive relationship with LaBarre for six years. LaBarre's ex- husband Wayne Ennis claimed that she had asked him to kill Wilfred. Wilfred LaBarre's daughter Laura Melisi claimed that LaBarre had threatened to shoot people. She stated she always disliked Sheila LaBarre, and had warned her father against pursuing a relationship. Her plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was rejected by the jury. They found her guilty and LaBarre was sentenced to life in prison without parole in June 2008. Her appeal in 2010 was rejected. LaBarre is currently serving her sentence at Homestead Correctional Institution, in Florida City, Florida.

Such situations place demands on a person's coordination and reserves of strength as well as requiring sufficient appreciation of the terrain. A person who is sure-footed is thus unlikely to slip or stumble.Soanes, Catherine and Stevenson, Angus (ed.) (2005). Oxford Dictionary of English, 2nd Ed., revised, Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, p. 1775. . On many hiking trails and mountain tours, sure-footedness is assumed to be a prerequisite without ever being defined. The term is frequently used in the literature presumably to ensure that the reader is made sufficiently aware that, under certain circumstances, one false step may lead to serious consequences.  Required attributes  Although there is no standard definition of sure-footedness,Was ist Trittsicherheit?\\" by Csaba Szepfalusi, Edelweiss Zeitung, Issue 4, 2003, pp 6-7 at www.oeav-events.at. Retrieved 1 Jun 2014. the following is a list of attributes that, as a rule, constitute what is generally meant: * Possession of sufficient coordination to progress over uneven ground as intended, without losing one's balance. That also includes being able to compensate for small slips when moving forward, without any serious consequences. * Correct assessment of the ground, both in terms of usable footholds or steps and also the level of grip they afford. One must be able to do this on all types of terrain, including scree, rock, schrofen, bare earth or firn, and also in wet conditions. * An ability to recognise those parts of the route which need to be negotiated with particular care due to the risk of falling. * Proper assessment of one's own level of coordination and ability, even when tired, in order to adjust one's rate of progress accordingly. Experience has shown that sure-footedness decreases in the afternoon due to physical and mental fatigue.  Limitation  A crossing of the west flank of the Heiligkreuzkofel requires sure-footedness in several places The requirement for sure-footedness is usually only mentioned when speaking about routes on which no special climbing ability is required. It is also not necessarily the case that someone with climbing experience is automatically sure-footed. Nor does sure-footedness imply a head for heights, something that is often stated as a requirement for using mountain paths. In this context, a head for heights means having the ability to negotiate exposed sections of a route without feeling unduly frightened. However, it is no accident that both requirements are often referred to together because, on exposed routes, the consequences of falling are likely to be serious.  Training  Sure-footedness is something that one can be trained in to a certain extent, especially through regular, strenuous exercise in steep, rough terrain that is not exposed. In the early phases hiking sticks can be helpful. However, too great a reliance on them can be detrimental to sure-footedness when crossing terrain where they are of no use‚Äîas for example on protected rock sections. On the other hand, hiking poles can be invaluable, especially for older hikers, and those with knee problems, and as well provide added security where a stumble might be hazardous, on uneven ground or an exposed path.  Animal sure-footedness  Alpine ibex standing on cliff in winter. The term sure-footedness is also used to describe animals that operate in difficult terrain and is seen as a characteristic, especially of goats and certain breeds of horse. Occasionally animals such as dogs are described as sure-footed. Yaks are used on climbing and trekking expeditions in the Himalayas because of their ability both as pack animals and sure-footedness.

The Bank is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is regulated by Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority as a bank and authorised deposit-taking institution, and is a member of the Customer Owned Banking Association (COBA). In 2013, the Bank was named Building Society of the Year for customer satisfaction by Roy Morgan Research, as judged by more than 50,000 consumers and 22,000 business decision-makers. This was followed up by wins in the Roy Morgan Research Bank of the Year category in 2016 & 2017\\\\.  History  In 1924, Mr FW Lean and Mr KA Mathieson Snr formed the Newcastle and Hunter River Public Service Starr- Bowkett Building Cooperative Society Ltd, a Starr-Bowkett society, in response to unemployment and economic depression in Newcastle, New South Wales. By providing interest-free home loans to members, the society provided an opportunity for home ownership at a time when low wages and high rent otherwise made it impossible for many. The Bank began as a building society, the Greater Newcastle Cooperative Permanent Building and Investment Society, which opened its first office in Newcastle, New South Wales in 1945. In 1946, it had assets of ¬£11,000. In 1968, the Society expanded outside the Hunter, opening its first Central Coast branch in Gosford. The Society‚Äôs first Sydney branch opened in 1972 in Penrith, and the first Illawarra branch at Warrawong opened in 1973. In 1980 the Society expanded north to the New South Wales North Coast, establishing branches at Ballina and Coffs Harbour. In 2003, the Society established its first Gold Coast branch at Robina. The Society has merged with a number of building societies over the years. In 1998, it merged with the Mitchell Building Society of Central Western NSW, and in 2011 it merged with ABS Building Society of Armidale. As of 2014 its assets were over A$5 billion. In May 2016, after receiving approval from its regulator APRA, the Society changed its name to Greater Bank. The ownership structure did not change, remaining as a mutual bank owned by customers, rather than shareholders. Operations Directors: * Wayne Russell - Chairman * Scott Robinson - Deputy Chairman * Roger Cracknell * Malcolm McDonald * Jayne Drinkwater * Russell Ware Management: * Scott Morgan - CEO  Advertising  In 2010, Australian marketing guru John Dwyer tempted actor Jerry Seinfeld out of retirement, to be spokesman for the Bank. Seinfeld had only ever lent his name to two marketing campaigns; American Express and Microsoft. Seinfeld starred in the company‚Äôs advertising campaigns for three years. The comedian‚Äôs tenure as spokesperson for the Bank marked a rise in brand awareness both locally and nationally.  Charity  The Bank established The Greater Charitable Foundation in 2011. The Foundation partners with Australian-based charitable organisations throughout the Bank‚Äôs area of operations with a goal of improving life outcomes and supporting families and communities. The Foundation was established with an initial allocation of $1 million by the Bank on behalf of its members and staff. The Bank continues to fund the Foundation from its profits on an ongoing basis, and the Foundation is governed by an independent Board of Directors.

Legend has it that a farm worker plowing the field heard a sound of his plow hitting metal, releasing a flow of blood. He ran away and narrated the incident to the landlord. The Landlord inspected the place, was convinced of the peasant's story, and brought in an astrologer. After conducting the prasanam, the astrologer concluded that the idol was the swaymbhu idol of the Bagavathy, making the venue extremely sacred. The landlord constructed a temple where the idol was found. The temple sreekovil is roof less and its idol is below the Asoka tree. Older residents say that this Asoka tree remains exactly the same size as it was in their own childhood.  Temple Festivals  Patham Padhiyam popularly known as Chanthatam is the major temple festival.

Chang, was a Chinese entrepreneur, film director, and film producer, who is considered a founding father of Chinese cinema. He and Zheng Zhengqiu made the first Chinese feature film, The Difficult Couple, in 1913, and cofounded the Mingxing (Star) Film Company in 1922, which became the largest film production company in China under Zhang's leadership. Zhang directed about 150 films in his career, including Laborer's Love (1922), the earliest complete Chinese film that has survived; Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923), one of the first Chinese box-office hits; The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928), the first martial arts film; and Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (1931), China's first sound film. After the destruction of Mingxing's studio by Japanese bombing during the 1937 Battle of Shanghai, Zhang Shichuan made films for the China United Film Production Company (Zhonglian) in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, which led to accusations of treason after the surrender of Japan in 1945. He never recovered from the humiliation, and died in 1953 or 1954. Early life Zhang Shichuan was born Zhang Weitong (Âº†‰ºüÈÄö) in Beilun, Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Shichuan was his courtesy name, originally written with the different characters . His father Zhang Heju (Âº†ÂíåÂ∑®) was a small merchant dealing with silkworms. His father died when Zhang was 16 years old, and he had to quit school and move to Shanghai to live with his maternal uncle Jing Runsan (ÁªèÊ∂¶‰∏â), a successful comprador. In Shanghai, he worked at the American-owned Huayang Company by day and studied English at night. Early ventures In 1913, Yashell and Suffert, two Americans in Shanghai who had acquired the Asia Film Company, asked Zhang to be their consultant. Despite his lack of experience in filmmaking, Zhang took over the company's work responsibilities. He sought help from Zheng Zhengqiu, a well-known playwright, and the two cofounded the Xinmin (Êñ∞Ê∞ë) Film Company to make film for the Asia Company. Soon they made China's first feature film, The Difficult Couple, in 1913. However, Xinmin and Asia went out of business when their supply of German film stock was cut off after the outbreak of World War I. When his uncle died, Zhang was asked by his aunt to manage the family's New World amusement park. In 1916, Zhang formed Huanxian (Fantasy) Film Company, when American film stock became available in Shanghai, and made the film Victims of Opium, adapted from a stage play. But the company soon folded, and he returned to manage the amusement park, which was sold in 1920. Mingxing Film Company In 1922, Zhang and his old partner Zheng Zhengqiu, together with Zhou Jianyun (Âë®Ââë‰∫ë), Zheng Zhegu (ÈÉëÈπßÈ∏™), and Ren Jinping (‰ªªÁüúËêç), founded the Mingxing (Star) Film Company. As a Western- influenced businessman, Zhang's main priority was profit, which differed from that of Zheng Zhengqiu, a playwright from an aristocratic family who emphasized cinema's role in social reform and moral enlightenment. The company's earliest films, such as The King of Comedy Visits Shanghai (1922), were mainly entertainment-oriented, but Zhang also directed Zheng's moralistic films such as Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923), which was a box-office success. When Zhang Shichuan's The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928) became a phenomenal hit, he produced as many as 17 sequels in the next three years. The film marked the beginning of the hugely popular martial arts film genre, and many competing studios rushed to make similar films. In 1928, Mingxing became a limited shareholding company, and registered with the government to sell stocks to the public. For its entire existence of 17 years, Zhang served as the company's general manager and director. Under his leadership, it became China's largest film production company. In cooperation with Hong Shen, Zhang directed Sing-Song Girl Red Peony in 1931, the first Chinese sound film (though it was sound-on-disc, not sound-on-film). In the early 1930s, Japan's invasion of Manchuria and attack of Shanghai produced a sense of national crisis in China. Mingxing made a leftist turn under Zhang's management. He hired a number of leftist writers, who wrote scripts for such films as The Tenderness Market (1933) and Lucky Money (1937). In August 1937, the Battle of Shanghai erupted, and the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanghai (except the foreign concessions) after months of fighting. The Mingxing Studio was destroyed by Japanese bombing in the battle. Zhang salvaged some equipment and joined the Guohua Film Company, but was never able to revive Mingxing. Japanese occupation and aftermath With the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese took over the Shanghai International Settlement, which had been under British and American control, and combined Shanghai's remaining film studios into the Zhonglian (China United) Film Production Company. Zhang worked for the Japanese-controlled company as a branch manager and director. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Zhang was accused of treason for having worked for the Japanese, but was not officially indicted. He briefly worked in Hong Kong for the Great China Film Company, and in Shanghai for the Datong Film Company, but never recovered from the humiliating label of traitor. He died in Shanghai in 1953 or 1954, aged 64. Legacy Zhang Shichuan is considered one of the founding fathers of Chinese cinema. He directed about 150 films in his career, including The Difficult Couple (1913), the first Chinese feature film; Laborer's Love (1922), the earliest complete Chinese film that has survived; Orphan Rescues Grandfather (1923), one of the first Chinese box-office hits; The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928), the earliest martial arts film which started an enormously popular genre; and Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (1931), China's first sound film. Under Zhang's leadership, Mingxing was the largest and most influential film studio in China. Many highly influential directors and writers, including Hong Shen, Cheng Bugao, Xia Yan, Ouyang Yuqian, Shen Xiling, Cai Chusheng, and Yang Hansheng, began or developed their careers at Mingxing.

While his actual accomplishments as a kick boxer have been questioned by the media in Uganda, with accusations ranging from rigged events to outright fraud, Golola has, nevertheless, been credited with popularizing the sport of kickboxing in Uganda (a discipline which previously generated minimal fan interest in Uganda) and has managed to build up a large fan following in Uganda. His 2011 fight against Abdul Qadir Rahim managed to attract the largest attendance in Uganda outside of Ugandan national football team matches and Golola has perhaps the largest fan following in Uganda outside of the national football team. Golola has one of the largest online fan bases of anyone in Uganda. His fans have created various memes associated with Golola and even their own parody version of Downfall starring Golola. He was also given the lead role in the Ugandan movie Christmas in Kampala.

All bar the Gypsy Jokers originated in WA. In 1989 these four gangs combined forces to violently eject the New Zealand-based street gang, the Mongrel Mob which was attempting to establish itself in Perth. Events escalated over a five-day period where Selwyn Wharepapa, one of the leaders of the Perth Mongrel Mob, was injured in the bombing of the Mongrel Mob's metalwork shop with two kilograms of gelignite and the Mongrel Mob retaliated with attempted explosion at a tattoo shop linked with the Gypsy Jokers. The following night police raided three homes, arresting seven people, including Wharepapa in possession of firearms, baseball bats and drugs.

The church is administered by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin of the Philippine Ecclesiastical Province and under the Vicariate of San Pedro Bautista of the Diocese of Cubao. The original church was located in Intramuros until it was destroyed during the Second World War. The altar image of Our Lady of Lourdes dating from 1894 was hidden and spared during the bombing. The present church was completed and inaugurated in 1951. In 1997, it was declared as a national shrine by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. Dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, the church celebrates its feast on February 11. Pope Francis granted a decree of Canonical coronation towards the image in 22 August 2020.  History  Eleven missionaries from Spain arrived in Manila on 13 May 1886 and stayed with the Franciscans in Intramuros. Six of the friars left while the remaining five continued to provide the spiritual needs of the area until they built the first Capuchin house in Gen Luna Street in Intramuros, Manila, opening it to the public on 8 May 1892. Father Berardo de Cieza requested Manuel Flores to sculpt a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes later that year. A second image was sculpted by the same person with the guidance of Father Antonio of Valencia. In September 1897, Architect Federico Soler started the enlargement of the chapel with help from donations from a Mr Moron. The new church dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes was inaugurated on 3 February 1910. When the Second World War erupted, the image of Our Lady of Lourdes was kept in the sacristy of San Agustin Church (Manila). It was found intact after the war and was transferred to the chapel of the University of Santo Tomas and later moved to Santa Teresita Chapel in Mayon Street, Quezon City. The Capuchins were able to obtain official authorization from the government on 9 February 1946 to the restore the church of Lourdes but decided to build a bigger church on an acquired 10,500 square meter lot located in Retiro Street, Quezon City. The construction of the new church started on 30 January 1950 by Engineer Marquez under the supervision of Father Bienvenido of Arbeiza as Custos. On 10 February 1951, the image of Our Lady of Lourdes was transferred to the new church from the temporary shelter in Mayon Street. The church was inaugurated on 15 August 1951, by the Archbishop of Manila, Monsignor Reyes who officiated at the mass which was attended by many important people including the President of the Philippine Senate, Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco who represented the Spanish Embassy and Miss Gullon, daughter of the Ambassador. On 24 January 1997, the church was declared National Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.

Then, suddenly, a young woman called Subiksha (Andrea Jeremiah) blocks his path and proposes to him and disappears. He takes it as a joke and goes away, but during the following week, he starts to wonder about her and questions himself on whether she told the truth. Because of this, he starts to wait in the subway every day. Subiksha does not come, but on the other hand, she visits his workplace in and his friend's room, where he stays. Unfortunately, both times, he does not make it in time to meet her. Finally when he meets her, she tells him that they have already met at a party where their mutual friend asks her to drop him at his place as he is very drunk. However, Vinod does not remember this incident. When he replies to her proposal, she rejects him by stating that she just messed with him for his behavior on the night when she dropped him at home, though he continues to pursue her. Subiksha puts a condition that if Vinod fought with Ashwin Ranjith (Aaran Chaudhary), a boxing champion, she would return his love. He agrees to fight him not only to win her love but also because of an incident that happened because of Ashwin which has caused him to stay away from his father Raghuraman (Azhagam Perumal). In a flashback, it is revealed that Vinod loved his father dearly and was at a shopping mall happily spending time with his family, but Ashwin unknowingly sits on some hot dogs. Because of this, Ashwin publicly insults Raghuraman. After this incident, Vinod stays away from Raghuraman. Raghuraman, who is Subiksha's colleague, narrates this incident to her, which causes Vinod to defeat Ashwin in the end.

Release =Critical reception= Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, stated, \\"(the) first half (of the film) is practically empty ‚Äî we have to wait for the second half for things to get going.

Rediff gave the same rating and wrote, \\"Valiyavan fails to impress, it is unworthy of the director who gave us the brilliant Engaeyum Eppothum\\". Sify wrote, \\"Valiyavan is a mixed bag. The first half is terrible with no story, and it is the last 30 minutes which has some meat in it. (The) script and presentation is a big letdown\\".

It was at one time owned by the well known colonial period furniture craftsman Thomas Elfe, whence its name. The eighteenth century house has been completely restored.  Description  The property originally consisted of two buildings, one along the street front and the other on the back part of the property. It is believed that the rear structure was Elfe's shop and that his home was the separate structure in front. Elfe, considered to be the best Charleston furniture craftsman in the eighteenth century,designed this single family house that he had built in 1760. It is a colonial Georgian style house. The over-all dimensions of the two story house are 16 feet, 5 3/4 inches by 30 feet, 2 1/4 inches. It is two bays by three bays. The main entrance to the house faces west, the street entrance for parking faces south. The frame house is faced with clapboards that are 9.5 inches wide and exposed 7.75 inches, tapering from three-quarters of an inch to half an inch in thickness. The clapboards are not original to the house and are replacement material of nineteenth century. The house consists of two bedrooms and three bathrooms.54-Queen-St-Charleston-SC-29401 Its size is 1670 square feet (260 square meters). The house suffered little damage in the 1886 Charleston earthquake. The reason surmised for this is that it is built with large heavy beams (3.5 inches X 5 inches) that are mortised and joined together with wooden pegs. It also did not sustain any major damage from Hurricane Hugo, which went through the area in 1989. The Thomas Elfe house is the oldest restored historical residence in Charleston that is open to the public for visiting tours. There are older house structures in Charleston, but they are either private residences or businesses. The guided candlelit tours sometimes feature music of the eighteenth century. The house interior is decorated to represent the period of Elfe's lifetime. The house has been featured in a program for House and Garden TV and has been written about in national magazines, like Early American Life Magazine. It is within walking distance of the renowned French Huguenot Church and Dock Street Theatre in Charleston's French Quarter. The house foundation has brick piers, and the property lot perimeter is partially surrounded by a brick wall. In the back yard are crape myrtles and a large old live oak tree. The two-story structure has four rooms. It was moved to the back of the lot by thirty feet and restored in 1968 from a badly deteriorated condition due to lack of maintenance. The house is now a touring museum open to the public. The interior represents Elfe's influence with such things as architectural features to make the rooms look bigger than they really are. The house has two brick chimneys. There is cypress cabinetry on the fireplace walls. The chimney alcoves have built-in closets and many rooms have china cabinets decorated with antiques. The house features nine-over-nine sashed windows, meaning nine panes of glass per window sash. This feature is well known for older Charleston historic homes. Elfe sold the house in 1763 to Richard Hart, a chairmaker. There have been many owners from that time to present. The house was restored by the then present owner of the time in 1967 - 1969 to represent the eighteenth century as Elfe would have lived in it. The property last sold in 2003 for a million dollars.

History It was originally called \\"The Feathers\\", but was renamed after Swan & Edgar, a former department store at Piccadilly Circus, about two miles away. It was a pub from 1899 until it closed in 2013. It was known for its unusual interior, having varnished books as wall cover and Scrabble tiles as bathroom flooring. In July 2013, the freehold and the pub were offered for sale at a guide price of ¬£650,000. The property attracted 90 viewings and 28 offers, and its estimated selling price was about ¬£900,000. In April 2014, Westminster Council received an application from the developers, seeking permission for a change of use into residential property. The application was refused in 2015. Description According to a description of the interior by the Evening Standard, \\"The bar in the diminutive ground floor is made from books stuck together into a curved wall and varnished. A plank of wood seals the top.\\" In keeping with the book theme, the pub hosted book signings, poetry readings, quizzes and society meetings, often using the upstairs room. Campaign A campaign, \\"Save The Linhope Street Local\\", was formed by local people eager to stop the redevelopment and have the pub designated as an Asset of Community Value. Local residents demonstrated on 7 April 2014, in support for this campaign. The Campaign for Real Ale's John Cryne said that the conversion of pubs is often into just single residences, and that this is what is proposed for the Swan & Edgar, but it does not help to solve London‚Äôs housing problems. \\"They are for millionaires ...

Early life Bristow was the third surviving son of Robert Bristow (1662‚Äì1706), MP of Micheldever, Hampshire, and his wife Katherine Woolley, daughter of Robert Woolley, vintner, of London. He became a leading merchant in trade with Portugal, and a prominent figure in the South Sea Company, of which he was a director from 1730 and then deputy governor from 1733. In 1733, he married Anne Judith Foisin, the daughter of Paul Foisin, an East India merchant in Paris. Career Quidenham Hall was acquired by Bristow some time after 1740 Bristow was returned by his brother-in-law, John Hobart, 1st Earl of Buckinghamshire, as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bere Alston at the 1734 British general election. He voted consistently with the Government. In 1739, on the outbreak of war with Spain, he and his partner Peter Burrell, were granted contracts for remitting money for the forces in Gibraltar, Minorca and Jamaica. The Jamaica contract was on very favourable terms and allegations arose that Walpole had made a bad bargain for the public. At the 1741 British general election he was returned as MP for St Ives. After the fall of Walpole in 1742, a secret committee was set up by the Commons to inquire into the Jamaica contract and endorsed the charges against him, but no action was taken. Bristow helped finance the continental war and, in 1744, was among the underwriters of a government loan, with a share ¬£150,000. In 1744 he was also appointed a trustee for a loan of ¬£200,000 to the King of Sardinia. In 1744, he was involved in raising supplies for the war. He was returned as MP for St Ives again at the 1747 British general election. In 1753 he was a financier who lent Danzig ¬£90,000. At the 1754 British general election, Bristow was returned as MP for Bere Alston again. He suffered great losses in the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, which led to financial difficulties for him from then on. In November he and his partners were asked by the Treasury to procure provisions for Portugal, and in December Bristow and Burrell were appointed to provide money for the relief of those distressed in Portugal, and were to be paid ¬£100,000 to cover costs. He became sub-governor of the South Sea Company in 1756. At the 1761 British general election, he was returned as MP for Arundel on the government interest. By this time he was owing the government considerable sums, but argued that his estate in Norfolk would provide more than enough to cover the amount, and he was owed large sums in Portugal. He went to Portugal and probably stayed there as he was absent for much of the parliament. He did not stand at the 1768 British general election. Death and legacy Bristow died in Portugal on 14 November 1768 leaving four sons and eleven daughters. His daughter Caroline married William Henry Lyttleton, MP. His daughter, Frances, married Richard Neave later Governor of the Bank of England. Another daughter, Harriot Elizabeth Slessor, who married an army officer stationed in Portugal, is an ancestor of actress Olivia Colman.The Genealogist - Who Do You Think You Are - Olivia Colman Bristow had acquired Quidenham Hall after 1740 and added an East Wing in Palladian style and a West portico supported by large Doric columns.

Biography  Elfe was born in 1719 in London, England. He was an accomplished and prolific furniture and cabinet craftsman of the American colonial period. Elfe, a contemporary of Thomas Chippendale, was considered Charleston's best furniture craftsman of the eighteenth century. His working career spanned almost thirty years from about 1746 to 1775. At one point in his career his personal worth was a fortune of over 6,200 English pounds. Local Charleston historian and one time director of the Charleston Museum, E. Milby Burton (1889‚Äì1977), attributed Elfe as the craftsman of some of the finest nationally acclaimed furniture produced. Burton's research of Charleston furniture craftsmen revealed Elfe as the most successful and famous furniture craftsman in the eighteenth century. \\"Thomas Elfe was Charleston's most famous and successful cabinetmaker, and his surviving pieces are among the most valuable of American antiques.\\" Elfe immigrated from England in the 1740s and first went to Virginia. From there right around 1746 he moved to Charleston. In 1747 he ran an ad in the South Carolina Gazette for a pair of gilted large carved scones; \\"To be Raffled for, On Tuesday the 6th of October in the Evening, at the House of Mr. Thomas Blyth in Broad-street a pair of large Gilt Sconces, valued at 150¬£ Currency. The said Sconces and the Conditions of the Raffle may be seen at Mr. Thomas Elfe's Cabinet-maker, near Doctor Martini's.\\" The ¬£150 value would be several thousand dollars in the twentieth century. In the mid-eighteenth century \\"Charles Town\\" was an economic booming city, the average resident citizens being several times wealthier on the whole than those of New York or Philadelphia. Providing furniture to these wealthy Charlestonians was a lucrative business for the local wood craftsmen and cabinetmakers. The people of Charleston considered themselves as English citizens that just happened to be living in the American colony of South Carolina and did everything possible to follow the footsteps of London society, like acquiring fine furniture. The wealthy Charlestonians loved London style furnishings and would purchase most anything along these fashions that was hand made by local woodworkers. This booming economy made Elfe's woodworking shop successful and profitable. An Elfe's business account book of transactions survives and is held by the Charleston Library Society. This accounting book covering several accounts shows that between 1768 and 1775 Elfe with several employees hand-made over fifteen-hundred furniture pieces including fine detailed cabinets. These records show that he sold about seventeen pieces of furniture per month on average. Elfe's work was influenced by Thomas Chippendale (1718‚Äì1779). Their lives had many parallels. Both were born in England at about the same time. Both apprenticed in the 1730s. Elfe apprenticed under his uncle. Chippendale apprenticed under his father. Elfe married in 1748, as did Chippendale, and both were eventually widowed. Both were eventually remarried and had a second wife. Both had a son named Thomas who took over their furniture business. Both lived during the tempestuous times leading to the American Revolution without being personally affected. Both had large furniture shops with many employees. Both died within four years of one another. Elfe was also a close friend of Charleston joiner and carver Thomas Watson. He learned many of Watson's woodworking skills. When Watson died in 1747, he left Elfe his estate and personal belongings.  Personal life  Elfe was first married to Mary Hancock, a widow, in June 1748. She died a few months later before the year ended. He didn't get married again until the end of 1755, when he married Rachel Prideau. His marriage to Rachel produced several children. Their names were William, Elizabeth, Hannah, George, Thomas, and Benjamin.  Works and locations  Elfe's innovative furniture designs consisted of stacking chests, double chests of drawers, and built-in cabinets. The style types represented Georgian, English Rococo, and Gothic. His furniture also featured Chinese and French styles. Elfe's furniture pieces can be found at South Carolina Governor's Mansion in Columbia. They are also at the Charleston Museum in South Carolina, the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum in Virginia, the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts in North Carolina, and the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware. File:36 Meeting Street.jpg36 Meeting Street, Charleston. The drawing room mantel is attributed to Thomas Elfe which still exists.  Death and Will  Elfe's Will of 7 July 1775 Elfe died on 28 November 1775. His will designated his son Thomas, the only cabinetmaker, to receive his business equipment and associated property. Three Negro cabinet- makers are listed in Elfe's will that he owned as property. Elfe would send his Negro cabinet-makers to various jobs to take down old furniture and set up new furniture or to make minor furniture repairs.  Properties  Elfe was a real estate entrepreneur and made a lot of money buying, selling, and renting properties in the Charleston area. He owned various properties from time to time that he used as his own residence or as a vacation retreat or as a furniture shop. It can not be pinpointed exactly where his major furniture shop was as there were different location descriptions. One description for his furniture shop from the South Carolina Gazette on 28 September 1747 was \\"near Doct. Martin's\\" ‚Äì a location that is not known. Another location for his furniture shop was given in 1748 as \\"at the corner opposite Mr. Eycott's\\" ‚Äì another unknown location. Elfe owned a property at Broad and Friend (now Legare). He advertised in the South Carolina Gazette in 1766 this property to rent. The ad said the main house was three stories high and each story had three rooms. There was a separate \\"chair-house\\" on the property, which was a shop where Elfe built chairs. A well known property that Elfe designed and built in 1760 as his personal home is at 54 Queen Street in Charleston, South Carolina.

Both an artist and a teacher, she received her formal art training at the Art Association of Montreal (AAM), where she studied under Alberta Cleland, William Brymner, and Maurice Cullen. Nora Collyer was the youngest of the ten women artists who today are commonly referred to as the Beaver Hall Group. Aside from being an artist and a teacher, she was also a volunteer for the Children's Memorial Hospital of Montreal. Collyer's work was exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, England, in 1924 and 1925, as well as at the 1939 New York World's Fair.  Early life and education  Collyer was born in Montreal, Quebec on June 7, 1898. Her father, Alfred Collyer (1872‚Äì1946), left England at the age of sixteen, and after graduating from McGill University he joined the General Electric Company of Canada. Around the time of Nora's birth, the family moved to Tupper Street in Westmount, a suburb of Montreal, where they lived until 1916. In her youth, Collyer attended Trafalgar School for Girls from 1910 until her graduation in 1917. Collyer, an only child until the age of twelve, and very shy, benefited from the small classes and intimate atmosphere of a private school. Two girls whom she'd met there, Margaret Taylor and Jane Speir, became her lifelong friends. Collyer, along with other artists Anne Savage, Sarah Robertson, Mabel Lockerby, and Kathleen Morris, received virtually all their professional training at the Art Association of Montreal (AAM). Collyer studied for nine years at the AAM with Alberta Cleland, William Brymner, and Maurice Cullen. Brymner, who was a director for thirty-five years, had previously trained in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian and organized the Montreal school on the Parisian model. Brymner's emphasis on the importance of self-expression and enthusiasm for new developments became greatly evident in Collyer's work.  Joining the Beaver Hall Group  Collyer became a member of the Beaver Hall Hill Group at the time of its Montreal establishment in the fall of 1920. Anne Savage and Collyer were the only Beaver Hall women who completed their secondary education. The President and co-founder, A. Y. Jackson, provided an important link between the Group of Seven and the Beaver Hall Group. He encouraged the women to free themselves of their old-fashioned academic training and to disregard female stereotypes. Nora and her female colleagues took this advice; they broke with Victorian convention despite social standards of the time.  The Beaver Hall Group  The Beaver Hall Group was one of Canada's most iconic unstructured artistic associations. The group only survived for a year and a half, but the friendships and alliances formed continued through the next two decades. The group held four exhibitions during its short existence, and at least one other show was held in the group's ‚Äúclub rooms,‚Äù from 22 November to 4 December 1920. Collyer left AAM in May 1921, and later shared a studio with Anne Savage. In 1924 the artists could no longer afford their studios; however, the surviving women members Mabel May, Lilias Newton, Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, Sarah Robertson, and Nora Collyer formed a network which expanded to include Prudence Heward, Kathleen Morris, and Ethel Seath.  Style and technique  Afternoon, the Village of Cap-√†-l'Aigle Overlooking the St. Lawrence River, 1950 The sketching trips Collyer took as a student with Maurice Cullen resulted in a harmonious and rhythmic technique. Collyer's work was known for its shapes, rich colours, and soft rhythms. Her paintings were rarely figurative and did not focus on people; her favourite subjects were flowers, the forest, riverscapes, nature, old houses, villages, and churches, as in Afternoon, the Village of Cap-√†-l'Aigle Overlooking the St. Lawrence River, 1950. Although Nora was aware of social problems and volunteered in hospitals, these concerns were not depicted in any of her paintings, and she did not use her painting as a direct vehicle for social commentary. Rather, her paintings focused on picturesque subjects, such as Mount Royal and the old Martello Towers of Quebec. Anne Savage had claimed that Collyer's work had a \\"freshness and vitality\\" that convey a lively sensitivity to both the rural and urban environments. Nora Collyer composed her images carefully, creating an interplay between the diagonals of the flowering trees, the triangular messes of land, and the horizontal bands of blue rivers, brown trees and mauve-blue hills. In addition, she would also make buildings such as a church or a barn as the focal point of the composition, as in Village Church In Summer (unknown date)  Teaching career  With a shining reference from William Brymner (a mentor at AAM), Collyer began her teaching career in September 1925. Although she had no previous training in teaching, she was appointed art mistress at Trafalgar School, with an annual salary of $800. After five years, her teaching career was brought to an abrupt halt due to the passing of her mother, Gertrude Palmer Collyer, on September 20, 1930. Collyer felt obligated to return home to manage the household for her father and brother. Inspired by her mother's volunteer work with the Anglican Church, Nora began to teach art at the Children's Memorial Hospital and other institutions. Some years later after her father's death in 1946, she became even more active as a teacher; organizing classes for children and adults in her own home. Kathleen Morris's niece, Susan Kilburn, attended one of Collyer's children's classes in the late 1940s and in 1953 took private lessons at Collyer's duplex on Elm Avenue. One of Collyer's preferred teaching techniques was to set up a still life for her student to paint, using it to demonstrate the use of contrast in painting.  Later years  Collyer kept up relationships with her friends from Trafalgar School, but her closest friend was Margaret Reid, who supplied the social ease in which she lacked. After her father's death in 1946, Collyer took an apartment at 3400 Ridgewood where she was later joined by Reid. Four years later, the two women bought a lot overlooking Lake Memphremagog where they built a summer cottage they called Strawberry Hill. Collyer would spend the summer there sketching and gardening and Margaret would visit on weekends. They had this cottage until 1967. Collyer and Reid moved into a duplex in Westmount in 1953, where Collyer used her sitting room for teaching. Reid had a family history with Alzheimer's disease, and in later years began to show symptoms of the disease. Collyer took care of her as long as she could, but finally had to put her in a nursing home. Collyer lived in the duplex until she died on June 11, 1979, just twelve days after her friend.

Biography The name Smendes is a hellenization of the Egyptian name Nesbanebdjed (\\"He of the ram, lord of Mendes\\"), while the ordinal number distinguishes him from the founder of the 21st Dynasty Smendes I, and from the earlier, namesake High Priest of Amun, Smendes II. A scarcely attested High Priest, he is mainly known for some Nile Level Texts at Karnak where he is called High Priest of Amun and son of king Osorkon: No. 17 (dating to a Year 8 of a deliberately omitted king), No. 18 (Year 13 or 14, king omitted) and No. 19 (Year lost, king omitted).Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 96; 157. Despite the lack of a conclusive record, it is almost certain that the \\"king Osorkon\\" father of Smendes III is Osorkon I: if so, Smendes also was the brother of his two predecessors Iuwelot and Shoshenq C and of the contemporary king Takelot I. Relying on the fact that the previous Nile Level (No. 16) was ordered by Iuwelot and dated in Year 5 of a nameless king who could only be Takelot I, it was concluded that the three levels ordered by Smendes were referring to the same pharaoh. About his life and the events occurred under his mandate almost nothing is known; as shown before, he continued the practice begun by his predecessor of omitting the name of Takelot I from the Nile levels,Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 96. possibly because of a presumed dynastic quarrel occurred in Upper Egypt after the death of Osorkon I.Gerard Broekman, \\"The Nile Level Records of the Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Dynasties in Karnak\\", Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 88 (2002), pp. 170‚Äì173. A scribe's palette now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (47.123a‚ÄìgPalette inscribed for Smendes, High Priest of Amun, at the MMA) inscribed for a High Priest of Amun Smendes, more likely belongs to him rather than Smendes II.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 504. A bronze kneeling statuette of a High Priest of Amun Smendes exhibited at the Mus√©e royal de Mariemont (ref. B242) cannot be securely attributed to one rather to another of the two namesake priests.Claire Derriks, Choix d'≈ìuvres 50, √âgypte. Mariemont, 1990, n.26 His succession is uncertain. According to Kenneth Kitchen,Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 159. towards the end of the reign of Takelot I, Smendes III was succeeded by Harsiese A, a son of his brother Shoshenq C, which in addition to High priest of Amun proclaimed itself an independent sovereign in Thebes. This hypothesis was rejected by Karl Jansen-WinkelnKarl Jansen-Winkeln, ‚ÄúHistorische Probleme Der 3. Zwischenzeit,‚Äù in JEA 81(1995), pp. 129‚Äì149. who proved that Harsiese A never was High Priest of Amun, hence that Smendes' successor should be looked in other people, perhaps in Nimlot C.

Criticism from a number of media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups highlighted problems such as Qatar's limited football history, the high expected cost, the local climate, and Qatar's human rights record. There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives. Several FIFA members have since gone on record saying that the decision to award the tournament to Qatar was a \\"mistake\\" which includes Theo Zwanziger and ex-president Sepp Blatter. Human rights issues =Migrant workers, slavery allegations and deaths= One of the most touched-on issues of the Qatar World Cup was the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure. Human Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation allege that the Kafala system leaves migrant workers vulnerable to systematic abuse. Workers may not change jobs or even leave the country without their sponsor's permission. In November 2013, Amnesty International reported \\"serious exploitation\\", including workers having to sign false statements that they had received their wages in order to regain their passports. After visiting a labour camp, Sharan Burrows of the ITUC described the workers as \\"basically slaves\\" and added that \\"If two years on [since the award of the 2022 World Cup] the [Qatari] Government has not done the fundamentals, they have no commitment to human rights\\". The Qatar 2022 Committee said: \\"Our commitment is to change working conditions in order to ensure a lasting legacy of improved worker welfare. We are aware this cannot be done overnight. But the 2022 FIFA World Cup is acting as a catalyst for improvements in this regard\\". Even though in May 2014 Qatar promised reforms to help protect migrant laborers, one year later, little progress has been made. Even if reforms Qatar has promised are implemented, employers will still have considerable power over workers. For example, a proposed requirement that wages must be paid into a designated bank account will not cover laborers paid in cash.\\"Still Slaving Away\\". The Economist. 6 June 2015: 38-39. Print. The Nepalese ambassador to Qatar, Maya Kumari Sharma, said that Qatar had become \\"an open jail\\" for workers from her homeland. A September 2013 report by The Guardian said a number of Nepalese workers have faced poor conditions as companies handling construction for 2022 World Cup infrastructure forced workers to stay by denying them promised salaries and withholding necessary worker ID permits, rendering them illegal aliens. The Guardian wrote that their investigation \\"found evidence to suggest that thousands of Nepalese, who make up the single largest group of labourers in Qatar, face exploitation and abuses that amount to modern-day slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organization, during a building binge paving the way for 2022\\". Nepalese workers in Qatar have been dying at a rate of one per day. A video report accompanying The Guardian's article showed men living in labour camps with unsanitary and dilapidated conditions. Workers told The Guardian they were promised high salaries before coming to Qatar and then their contracts were destroyed upon their arrival to Qatar. Some said they had not been paid in months, but the construction companies denied them their worker IDs or passports, rendering them trapped. Workers described having to beg for food and being beaten. They could try to escape, but if caught without proper papers, they would be arrested. =LGBT fans= The status of homosexuality as illegal in Qatar and punishable by death attracted attention in the media. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially said: \\"I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities\\"; he later added that: \\"we [FIFA] don't want any discrimination. What we want to do is open this game to everybody, and to open it to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022\\". After rumors and allegations that Qatar would introduce \\"medical screening tests\\" to \\"detect\\" and ban homosexuals from entering the country, LGBT activist Peter Tatchell said \\"FIFA now has no option but to cancel the World Cup in Qatar\\". However, no such screening test exists. It was later revealed that this proposal came from Kuwait and not Qatar. Climate As the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than . Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \\"affect performance levels from a health point of view\\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \\"recovery times between games would be longer\\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \\"more mistakes would be made\\". Additionally, one of the doctors said that \\"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\\".Foreign Bodies, pp98-100, Qatar Today, November 2010. http://www.issuu.com/oryxmags/docs/qt_november_2010 The inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was \\"high risk\\" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one. =Provisions inside stadiums= Qatar bid's chief executive, Hassan al-Thawadi said \\"Heat is not and will not be an issue\\". Also, John Smallwood, an award-winning sports columnist for the Daily News, stated that the Qatar 2022 Bid's official site explains: > Each of the five stadiums will harness the power of the sun's rays to > provide a cool environment for players and fans by converting solar energy > into electricity that will then be used to cool both fans and players at the > stadiums. When games are not taking place, the solar installations at the > stadiums will export energy onto the power grid. During matches, the > stadiums will draw energy from the grid. This is the basis for the stadiums‚Äô > carbon-neutrality. Along with the stadiums, we plan to make the cooling > technologies we‚Äôve developed available to other countries in hot climates, > so that they too can host major sporting events. =Winter World Cup= The notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter has said the tournament won't take place in January or February, because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the football players in the tournament are predominantly Christian). The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues. FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \\"blatant mistake\\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanagable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues. In October 2013, a taskforce was commissioned to consider alternative dates, and report after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In early 2014, FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke appeared to preempt this, saying: \\"Frankly, I think it will happen between November 15 and the end of December because that is when the weather is more favourable. It‚Äôs more like springtime in Europe\\". This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice President Jim Boyce responded in saying that \\"it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned. It was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015\\". Another option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe. Franz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: \\"One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable there\\". \\"Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East\\". At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible, but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June‚ÄìJuly games would be for the host association to propose. Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery. The notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President Michel Platini's indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly. Platini's vote for the summer 2022 World Cup went to Qatar. FIFA President Sepp Blatter also said that despite air-conditioned stadiums the event was more than the games itself and involved other cultural events. In this regard, he questioned if fans and players could take part in the summer temperatures. In addition to objections by European leagues, Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the A-League and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme. In September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The Fox Broadcasting Company who had paid $425 million for the right to broadcast both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the USA, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's NFL season, which takes place in the winter. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation. On 12 February 2015, FIFA awarded Fox the rights to the 2026 World Cup, without opening it up for bidding with ESPN, NBC, and other interested American broadcasters. Richard Sandomir of The New York Times reported that FIFA did so to avoid Fox from suing in U.S. courts, which under the American legal system could force FIFA to open up their books and expose any possible corruption. As BBC sports editor Dan Roan observed, \\"It does not seem to matter to FIFA that rival networks ESPN and NBC may have wanted to bid, or that more money could have been generated for the good of the sport had a proper auction been held. As ever, it seemed, FIFA was looking after itself\\". On 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event is scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators have noted the clash with the Christmas season is likely to cause disruption, whilst there is concern for how short the tournament is intended to be. The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations will also be moved from January to June to avoid African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country Guinea starts about that time. Transportation At the opening of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP), The International Association of Public Transport in Qatar, Jassim bin Saif Al Sulaiti, Minister of transport, said: \\"Qatar is currently working on the development of advanced transport infrastructure in the country which will not only help us to prepare for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but will be a legacy for our people and our country\\". Also, he said \\"the Doha Metro network with four integrated lines would cover 233 km and 96 stations. In the first phase, the network would run a length of and would include 38 stations by 2019. There would be a light rail transport network in Lusail, the Lusail LRT, with 32 km of tracks and 35 stations. The project is connected to Doha Metro\\". =Roads and highways= According to a staff writer for BQ in 2014, \\"Qatar currently has about 2,500 km of highways and the set plan is for by 2020, in addition to public transport bus lines\\". The writer quoted Jassim bin Saif Al Sulaiti, Minister of transport, who said \\"local roads now extend to an area covering and the set plan is to increase this area to cover 2020. We currently have 160 bridges connecting roads and it is expected that the number of bridges would reach 200 by 2020, in addition to increasing the number of tunnels from the current one to 32 in the future\\". =Public transport= According to a staff writer for BQ, \\"work is underway to improve the public bus service and infrastructure and a plan of action has been drawn up covering a period of five years\\". The writer quoted Jassim bin Saif Al Sulaiti, Minister of transport, who said \\"Qatar has allocated QR 5 billion over the next five years to develop the current fleet of 400 buses in the public transport company to a network of 2,000 buses\\". Cost By some estimates, the World Cup is going to cost Qatar approximately ¬£138 billion (US$220 billion). This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Dr. Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that ¬£107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further ¬£31 billion on transport infrastructure. Ritter said ¬£30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with ¬£48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans. A further ¬£28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament. According to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch; the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organizers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned. A report released on 9 December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that Qatar's neighbours could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to incorporate the people of the region during the tournament. Cultural and political issues =Qatar and football= At the time of being awarded the tournament, Qatar were ranked 113 in the world, and had never qualified for the World Cup before. The furthest the team had ever progressed in the AFC Asian Cup was to the quarter- finals in 2000 (repeated in 2011, as hosts). The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting (won once again in 2014, in Saudi Arabia). Qatar will be the smallest country to host the World Cup (smaller than 1954 hosts Switzerland) and, as of 2010, had a permanent population of less than one million people, less than the 1.7 million population of Uruguay in 1930, when they hosted the tournament. These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts. The Qatar Football Association has also been known to naturalize players from foreign nations for its own team. Examples include Sebasti√°n Soria, Luiz J√∫nior and Emerson Sheik. The Qatar FA has previously attempted to offer incentives to uncapped players of other nations to switch allegiance to the Gulf state. These have included the German-based Brazilian trio of A√≠lton, Ded√© and Leandro in 2004 ‚Äì none of whom have ever played in or have other connections to Qatar ‚Äì to help their team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. FIFA blocked the moves and as a result, tightened eligibility requirements for national teams. Qatar also hires migrant workers to fill their empty stadiums in the Qatar Stars League, paying them one dollar an hour to \\"sit in the stadiums and pretend to have fun\\". =Alcohol= Hassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event. Specific fan-zones will be established where alcohol can be bought. Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia. =Israeli qualification= The head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar's not recognising the state of Israel. Corruption controversies There have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee. =2011= In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice- President Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing. A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar.Sports Illustrated, \\"Sorry Soccer\\", 23 May 2011, p. 16. She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them. She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction. FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction.Qatar World Cup whistleblower retracts her claims of Fifa bribes. The Guardian. 10 July 2011. Retrieved 12 October 2012. =2014‚Äì15= In March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million. The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S. FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid. On 1 June 2014, The Sunday Times claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5 million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges. Later in June 2014, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy. In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \\"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\\". =2019= In January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote. According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of J√©r√¥me Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption. The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterized the bonus as \\"production contributions\\" which were \\"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\\". According to leaked documents obtained by The Sunday Times, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police. FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to The Sunday Times in an email and wrote \\"allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. FIFA is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.\\" A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not \\"respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.\\" Damian Collins, a British Member of Parliament (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract \\"appears to be in clear breach of the rules\\". Former UEFA president Michel Platini was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. He was detained at the Anti- Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris. The arrest represents the first substantial public move in an investigation into the Qatar decision opened two years ago by France‚Äôs Parquet National Financier, which is responsible for law enforcement against serious financial crime. Support of terrorism by Qatar In reaction to the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis over the support of terrorism by the Qatari Government, the president of the German Football Association, Reinhard Grindel stated in June 2017, that \\"the football associations of the world should conclude that major tournaments cannot be held in countries which actively support terrorism\\", and that the German Football Association will talk with UEFA and the German Government in order to evaluate whether to boycott the tournament in Qatar in 2022.

Its official name was Reunion of Friends of the Republic (R√©union des Amis de la R√©publique). It was composed of former terrorists and inconditional Jacobins coming from the petite bourgeoisie.Membership was 50 French livres which excluded common people The club met on the Montagne Sainte-Genevi√®ve, in the former royal Abbey of St Genevieve, near the Panth√©on, now Lyc√©e Henri-IV. Among the founders was Ren√© Lebois, printer and journalist of the Orateur pl√©b√©ien, maybe a Barras agent. The club was attended by those who wanted to redirect the Directory policy toward the left in the way of the defeat of the 13 Vend√©miaire royalist insurrection. However the polit√écs of the club were initially rather moderate and respectful of legality in refusing to receive the ineligible National Convention members. But the club soon attracted a number of former Montagnards, including Jean- Pierre-Andr√© Amar and Pierre Joseph Duhem, former members of the Committee of General Security, Pierre-Antoine Antonelle, Sylvain Mar√©chal, Restif de La Bretonne, Jean-Nicolas Pache, and Robert Lindet, as well as Philippe Buonarroti, a Babeuf friend, who moved the club in the direction of radical republicanism. Membership in the club grew rapidly: from 934 members the 29 November 1795, its meetings attracted about 2400 people in February 1796. Several members of the club, defeated in the National Convention election, as well as terrorists like Augustin Darth√©, former prosecutor for the Revolutionary Tribunal, nurtured the ambition of transforming the club. They wanted the government to give up the Constitution of the Year III of 1795 to go back to the more radical Constitution of 1793. Although not member of the club, Gracchus Babeuf was one of the key speakers and developed his equality doctrine viewed as essential elements for communism. Fearing that the club might disturb law and public order and even its own legitimacy, the Directory ordered its dissolution, and on 27 February 1796 the G√©n√©ral Bonaparte, commanding the Army of the Interior, carried out the orders. The leaders of the Club would subsequently form the core of Babeuf's Conspiracy of the Equals.

As a member of the Beaver Hall Group, Coonan mostly did figure paintings. Influenced by William Brymner and James Wilson Morrice in early years and later on by European impressionism, Coonan‚Äôs works had the features of both impressionist and modern styles. Through her faithful depiction of nature and people, she significantly influenced the development of modernism and impressionism in Canada.  Early life  The daughter of William Coonan, a machinist for the Grand Trunk Railway, and Mary Anne Fullerton, she was born in the Pointe- Saint-Charles neighbourhood of Montreal and was educated at the nearby St. Ann's Academy for Girls. Emily was encouraged to study art early on when she was enrolled in art classes at the Conseil des Arts & Manufactures around 1898, with the instructors Edmund Dyonnet, Joseph Charles Franchere, Joseph Saint-Charles, and Charles Gill. She then studied at the Art Association of Montreal with William Brymner between 1905‚Äì1901. Brymner was the primary instructor for the members of the Beaver Hall Group, which Coonan took part, and he was especially open to her exploration into the styles of impressionism and post-expressionism, while also supporting her development of a more modernist style.  Artistic career  In 1907, once enrolled into the Art Association of Montreal, Coonan started exhibiting her work in the institute, where she would continue to show her work until 1933. Her first award-winning piece, Eva and Daisy (1907), was a figure study of Coonan‚Äôs sisters, which won her first place in the annual Art Association of Montreal student show of 1907. In 1913, the National Gallery of Canada awarded her with their first travelling bursary, which was a prize that was given to the art student that exemplified the most potential to study and practice in Europe. Due to the onset of the First World War, Coonan‚Äôs trip was postponed to 1920. During her stay abroad, she started to demonstrate her stylized version of European modernism within her works and began creating predominantly landscape paintings. Once she returned to Canada in 1921, she became a member of the Beaver Hall Group. Unlike the other members of the Beaver Hall Group who were members of Montreal's Protestant upper class, Coonan was a devout Roman Catholic from a working-class background. As a member of the Beaver Hall Studios, Coonan participated in a few of the four shows that the group put on before the group went their separate ways in 1922. Coonan gained international acclaim as her piece Girl in Dotted Dress (1923) was selected to show in the British Empire Exhibition in England. She took inspiration from the French impressionists and James Wilson Morrice. After her instructor, Brymner, died, Coonan created and exhibited fewer works, opting out of participating in the Royal Canadian Academy‚Äôs spring exhibition and then only taking part in three more spring shows in her life. Although she continued to paint later in life, Coonan stopped participating in public exhibitions after 1933.  Late life  Coonan did not stop painting altogether after 1933, but she ceased to produce for the public sphere. Due to harsh criticism for her progressive style and the death of Brymner, her mentor, and then her father, Coonan painted only for her family and friends for the remainder of her life. Although Coonan never married and preferred to live and work in solitude, the majority of her works represented her close ones. Coonan lived in her childhood home until 1966. She died in 1971 at the age of 86 while living with her niece Patricia Coonan in Montreal.  Works  Coonan's works are included in the collection of the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec and the National Gallery of Canada.

Biography  He was born to a poor family and was apprenticed to a house painter at an early age. At the age of nineteen, he went to Antwerp, seeking an apprenticeship with a decorative painter to improve his chances of earning a good living. While there, he also took drawing classes in the evening at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Eventually, he found a position with the Belgian landscape painter, Theodoor Verstraete.Brief biography @ the De Valk Lexicon. He had his first successful showing at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (1885). He remained in Belgium as a freelance painter and won a medal at the Seconde Exposition Internationale d'Anvers in 1894 for his painting of a wheatfield in Flanders. He married shortly thereafter, dividing his time between Paris and Barbizon; concentrating on landscapes and still-lifes after the style of the old Dutch Masters. That same painting received a gold medal at the Salon two years later. In 1895 he returned to the Netherlands and settled in Blaricum. He was not as successful there, however, and his request for membership at the Pulchri Studio was denied. Despite being married, his life took on a Bohemian quality. He began doing interiors with figures, which became popular in the United States. Shortly after 1900, he spent time in Italy to recover from surgery. After that, his work became more Impressionistic and often included flowers. In 1905, he moved to Katwijk aan Zee and began painting beach scenes. A few years later, he moved to Laren and lived there until his sudden death during a taxi ride home from Baarn.  Personal life  Pieters married Marie Eugenie van den Bossche (1855‚Äì1940), daughter of Jules van den Bossche and Badima on 15 October 1895 in Haarlem.

Background There are differing accounts regarding Nizam Bai's origins. English traveller Jack Hogg described her as \\"a dancing-girl in the house of a Nawab.\\" Alternatively, author Muni Lal found it more likely that she belonged to a noble family from Hyderabad. He stated that her father, Fatehyawar Jang, fought for Aurangzeb in the Mughal wars against the Deccan sultanates. Nizam Bai's marriage was supposedly done in recognition of this service. Life Nizam Bai was married at the age of seventeen to Aurangzeb's son Prince Muazzam (the later Emperor Bahadur Shah I) on March 12, 1660. The couple's son, the eventual Emperor Jahandar Shah, was born little over a year afterwards. She reportedly had great influence over her husband at one stage, though involved herself little in political matters. Much of her interests were instead focused on the arts, religion and charity, with a large portion of her incomes being used to provide dowries for disadvantaged girls.

Waarp R66 has more specific capacities to handle secure and production contexts. From file transfer aspect, Waarp R66 ensures delivery guarantee and resuming interrupted transfers. Those transfers, synchronous or asynchronous, in push or pull, are based on transfer rules ensuring right and partner authentication control. Transfer trigger could be done through daemons (directory spooling), command line calls or through one of the various available API (Java, Thrift, REST HTTP(s)). From production aspect, Waarp R66 proposed local administration interface (HTTPS) or central ones (GUI). It optimizes the usage of the network (using multiplexing, bandwidth throttling, proxy support, Keep-alive and timeout, ...) or the usage of other resources (cpu and memory). It allows a high availability installation and the support of horizontal scalability with a high parallel transfer capability (in theory up to 2^64). From security aspect, Waarp R66 allows to secure exchange through low to high authentication mechanism of partners, a black list, tentative of intrusion detection, DMZ configuration support and restricted access definition for partners. From business needs adaptation aspect, Waarp R66 supports several task types (tasks are executed before or after a transfer or an error) as file management (copy, delete, tar/zip, charset transcoding, ...), transfer management (re-transfer or reschedule) and external task execution (script or Java).

It is centered at the junction of New Hampshire Route 153 and Mountain Laurel Road, which was historically the major north-south route in Carroll County. The district consists mainly of residential properties dating from the 18th to early 20th centuries, and also includes the 1836 town hall (supplanted in 1895 by the current town hall in Sanbornville), public library¬∏ Grange Hall, and a one-room schoolhouse that now houses the local historical society. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The junction around which the village grew was created in 1778, when the road branching northeast was laid out in the direction of Parsonsfield, Maine. Most of the houses in the district date roughly from this time to the 1820s, and are either vernacular or Federal in style. The notable exceptions are \\"Westlook\\", a Colonial Revival house built in 1929, and the Jackson Horne House, built in 1875 and remodeled in 1865. The oldest house in the district is believed to be \\"The Anchorage\\", a vernacular Cape style house that appears to date to the 1770s. The Old Town Hall was built in 1836, and hosted the town's meetings until 1895, when the new town hall was built. It has since been leased to the Congregational Church, which uses it for social service functions. The Lovell Grange Hall was built in 1918 for a chapter organized in 1892. It is a rectangular wood frame clapboarded structure mounted on concrete piers. The old portion of Wakefield Library building began as a lawyer's office in the 1860s, and was acquired by the town in 1895 as a gift from Seth Low. The newer portion, also donated by Low, was built in 1902-03. The Colonial Revival Congregational Church was built in 1958, replacing an 1831 church that burned in 1956; it is not historically significant.

In 2014 he established himself as one of the best colts of his generation in Europe by winning the Dante Stakes and the Prix du Jockey Club before defeating the dual Derby winner Australia in the Irish Champion Stakes. At the end of the year he was rated level with Australia and Kingman as the best three-year-old colt in the world. He has continued to compete in Group races until 2017 but did not recapture the form shown in his three-year-old season. Background The Grey Gatsby is a grey colt bred in Ireland by M Parrish. He was one of the first crop of foals of Mastercraftsman, which also included graded winners Kingston Hill, Amazing Maria and Craftsman. As a two-year-old Mastercraftsman won the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and National Stakes and was crowned Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt in 2008. As a three-year-old Mastercraftsman went on to record victories in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes before being retired to stud. The Grey Gatsby was purchased for ‚Ç¨120,000 in May 2013 and was sent into training with Kevin Ryan at his stables near Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= The Grey Gatsby began his career winning a maiden race over six furlongs at York. Despite showing signs of inexperience he won by three quarters of a length. In his next two starts, in the Group 3 Acomb Stakes and Group 2 Champagne Stakes he was runner up. In October he was entered into the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy but could only manage seventh place behind fellow Mastercraftsman colt Kingston Hill. =2014: three-year-old season= The Grey Gatsby's first start in 2014 was over a mile in the Craven Stakes where he finished two lengths behind the then unbeaten Toormore. Both horses went on to compete in the first classic of that season the 2000 Guineas. The Grey Gatsby went off as a 66/1 outsider in the Newmarket classic and finished in 10th place behind the winner Night of Thunder. His next start was in the Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, traditionally a trial for The Derby. Godolphin's colt True Story, who was entered for the Derby, started as odds-on favourite for the race on ground officially good to soft. The Grey Gatsby, ridden by Ryan Moore for the first time, drifted right in the final furlongs but still went on to win. A stewards enquiry was held but the result stood. Ryan shared plans to run the colt in the Prix du Jockey Club rather than the English Derby. The trainer later said he felt the colt \\"Didn't get the credit he deserved after the Dante Stakes\\" with his win overshadowed by the poor performance of True Story. On 1 June, the colt contested the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly. Ridden again by Ryan Moore, he was a relative outsider with French trained horse Prince of Gibraltar starting as favourite. Despite the horse sweating up badly and a poor start Moore was able to get the colt into the lead in the final furlongs and stay there to win by three lengths and in a record time. He was the first British-trained winner since 2005. He returned to France in July for the Grand Prix de Paris, but failed to reproduce his Chantilly form, finishing sixth behind the Andr√© Fabre-trained Galante. The Grey Gatsby was matched against older horses for the first time in the International Stakes at York in August. He was restrained at the back of the field by his rider Richard Hughes before moving up to challenge in the straight. He finished second, beaten two lengths by The Derby winner Australia, with Telescope and Mukhadram in third and fourth. Leopardstown On 13 September, The Grey Gatsby (ridden by Moore) faced Australia again in the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. He was made the 7/1 second favourite behind the Derby winner in a field which also included Mukhadram, Al Kazeem and Trading Leather. Moore held the colt up at the back of the field and was still in last place on the turn into the straight. Australia took the lead with a quarter of mile left to run, but The Grey Gatsby produced a sustained run on the outside to catch the Derby winner in the final strides and win by a neck. Commenting on the colt's late challenge Moore said \\"I was confident that I‚Äôd pass five of [the horses in front]. I just wasn‚Äôt quite so confident about the sixth (Australia)\\" whilst Ryan said; \\"He's a great horse and it was a fantastic ride. Now the horse will get the credit that he deserves. He hasn‚Äôt had it yet\\". The Grey Gatsby was expected to end the season in the Champion Stakes in October, but was withdrawn six days before the race as Ryan felt the colt would be unsuited by the softening ground. =2015: four-year-old season= The Grey Gatsby at YorkFor his first appearance as a four-year-old, The Grey Gatsby was sent to Dubai to contest the Dubai Turf over nine furlongs at Meydan Racecourse on 28 March. He started the 6/4 favourite but finished second behind the French five-year-old Solow. On his return to Europe he started favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh but finished fourth of the six runners behind Al Kazeem. At Royal Ascot in June the colt started the 9/2 second favourite behind Free Eagle in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, a race which also attracted Spielberg from Japan and Ectot from France. After racing on the inside just behind the leaders he was repeatedly denied a clear run in the straight and failed by a short head to catch Free Eagle after finishing strongly. Despite his defeat, the Racing Post rated The Grey Gatsby's run as the best performance of the five-day meeting. On 4 July, The Grey Gatsby was matched against The Derby winner Golden Horn in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. After tracking the Derby winner until the turn into the straight Spencer moved up alongside Golden Horn but was outpaced in the final furlong and finished second, three and a half lengths behind the winner, but four and a half lengths clear of the other runners. In August, he faced Golden Horn again in the International Stakes and started 5/1 third favourite behind the Derby winner and the improving three-year-old Time Test. He was held up at the rear of the field by Spencer before making progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished third to the 50/1 outsider Arabian Queen, who defeated Golden Horn by a neck. In September ran against Golden Horn for the third time as he attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Irish Champion Stakes. He was held up at the rear of the field but made little progress in the straight and finished sixth of the seven runners. =2016: five-year-old season= The Grey Gatsby stayed in training as a five-year-old but struggled to recapture his best form. He finished fourth to My Dream Boat in the Prince of Wales's Stakes and was then beaten by Big Orange when favourite for the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July. He ran sixth behind Postponed in a strong renewal of the International Stakes and then finished last of the sixteen runners in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In the Champion Stakes at Ascot on 14 October he produced an improved effort, briefly taking the lead in the straight before finishing fifth behind Almanzor, Found, Jack Hobbs and My Dream Boat. =2017: six-year-old season= In January 2017 The Grey Gatsby was transferred to the stable of Dermot Weld in Ireland. He failed to recapture his form, finishing no better than fourth in six races, and was retired at the end of the year. Assessment and awards In the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, The Grey Gatsby was rated the third-best horse to race anywhere in the world in 2014 behind the Japanese horses Just A Way and Epiphaneia and level with Able Friend, Australia, Kingman and Variety Club. He was the joint top-rated horse in the Intermediate distance division and the joint top-rated three-year-old.

The family's origins date back to the year 1135, when Wolfkerus de Branka attested a charter regarding an endowment to Admont Abbey, thus making it one of the oldest families in Austria still present today. In addition to the Styrian mainline, other branches existed in Salzburg, Carinthia, Lower Austria and Bavaria.Werner Hammerl, Pranckh In later parts of history, the family rose from Knights to Reichsfreiherren (Barons of the Holy Roman Empire) and Reichsgrafen (Imperial Counts of the Holy Roman Empire).Obituary of Siegmund Freiherr von Pranckh in Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft f√ºr Salzburger Landeskunde (MGSLK) XXVIII, 1888, 436 Edition 28, 1888, pp. 436Dr. Bernhard Peter, Abtei SeckauCount Friedrich Lanjus von Wellenburg, Die bl√ºhenden Geschlechter des √∂sterreichischen Uradels (PDF; 1,5 MB), pp. 43 Many of their names can be found in high court and state offices of the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Branches of the family exist to this day in Austria, Germany, France and the United States.  History  = Origins and Styrian line = The family traces its origins back to Feistritz bei Knittelfeld in Styria, where it first appeared in documents dated 1135, when Wolfkerus de Branka testified an endowment made by his brother Pilgrim von Feistritz to the Benedictine Abbey of Admont.Urkundenbuch des Herzogtums Steyermark II, 1 They were knights of the free nobles of Feistritz-Traisen, which subsequently, under Adalram von Waldeck, a descendant of the Aribonids, founded the Augustinian Abbey of Seckau in 1140, which explains the family's close relationship with Seckau. After their principals had become extinct, they became ministeriales of the territorial lords and provosts of Seckau, among them Arnold, Ortolf, who decreed renovations and new constructions of the Abbey, as well as Ulrich II. von Pranckh. The family crypt was located in Seckau as well, where to this day the red marble tombs of the nobles Johannes Pranckhher von Pranckh and Ernst Pranckhher of Pranckh are preserved. The continuous succession of the family begins in 1242 with Ulrich von Pranckh. In 1298 the marriage between Friedrich von Pranckh and heiress Anna von Pux, descendant of the Saint Countess Hemma von Gurk was officiated. Anna von Pux brought her coat of arms, estates in Styria and Carinthia and the future ruling seat of the family, the castle of Pux, located at the upper bank of the Mur near Teufenbach.Foundation Seeau, Pranckh zu Pux However, the ruling seat was not moved to Pux until 1425. A different part of the family remained in St. Marein, which saw increased invasions of the Turks during these times ‚Äì they however did not dare to attack the castle of Pranckh. In 1459, Ernst Pranckhher Knight von Pranckh zu Katsch awarded the Benedictine Admont of Abbey the right to collect tithe and the Zehenthof zu Petersdorf in St. Peter am Kammersberg to further underline the family's relation with the Abbey. Furthermore, the family maintained close relations with the Benedictine Abbey of G√∂ss by for instance providing abbesses.G√∂ss Abbey in Wikipedia = Lower Austrian line = The Lower Austrian line of the family was established by Ernst von Pranckh zu Bockfliess, governor of the lower quarter under the Manhartsberg (Weinviertel). Descendants include Eustachius von Pranckh zu Rickersdorf, who acquired the Veste Hof located at the river banks of the March. His son Friedrich von Pranckh later moved the castle to the higher situated location Hofberg and thus laid the foundation of Schloss Hof, later owned by Prince Eugene of Savoy.Marktgemeinde Engelhartstetten, Schlo√ühof As the oldest owners of Engelhartstetten, the community where Schloss Hof is located, two mutually crenellated red crossbars of the Lords of Pranckh are shown in the municipal coat of arms.Federal Chancellery  Legal Information, √ºber die Verleihung eines Wappens ... f√ºr die Town Engelhartstetten = Salzburg line = The progenitor of the thriving line is Ulrich von Pranckh (‚Ä† 1416/1420), from whom onwards descending lines are fully established. Closer progenitor is Rupprecht von Pranckh (‚Ä† 1575). His son Roman founded the Salzburg line of the family by marrying Anna Susanna von √úberacker, who belonged to Bavarian Uradel. In 1628, Emperor Ferdinand II elevated Johann Christoph Knight von Pranckh, member of the imperial war council and seneschal, Lord of Pux, Poppendorf, Rhine Valley and Frondsberg, together with all blood relatives, to hereditary Barons of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsfreiherrenstand), and raised to Salzburg state estates in 1651. In 1719, the brothers Ferdinand Josef and Georg Wilhelm, Lord of Sch√∂nau, Hallenau and Zinzendorf were raised to Imperial Counts of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsgrafenstand) by Emperor Charles VI. At the beginning of the 19th century, however, the counts‚Äô line became extinct. In 1765 Leopold Count von Pranckh, colonel and commander of the praiseworthy 2nd Bavarian district regiment, became Lord and Landmann of Salzburg.Salzburgwiki, Pranckh = Bavarian line = Siegmund Amadeus Freiherr von Pranckh (* 1768), descendant from the Salzburg branch of the family, following services in the Prince- Archbishopric of Salzburg and Austrian military, relocated his seat to Bavaria where he was appointed royal treasurer and lieutenant colonel. His son Siegmund (* 1821) became the royal Bavarian Minister of War and General and initiated the extensive army reform of 1868. He was also significantly involved in the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles in 1870 and was granted an endowment of 100,000 crowns from the war compensation awards for his achievements. In 1873 he returned to Styria to take over the allodial entailed rule Pux from Ludwig (‚Ä† 1880), the last descendant of the Styrian line at the time.  Estates and rulership  The reach of the family Pranckh primarily covered the upper valley of the Mur.

There were two periods when it was an independent lake, not associated with a larger body of water in the Huron basin. The first Lake Saginaw was a contemporary of the last stages of Lake Maumee. When the ice border opened allowing these two lakes to become one, it entered the period of Lake Arkona. Then, the ice advanced, closing the link forming the second Lake Saginaw. This was during the time of Lake Whittlesey. When the ice margin retreated northward for the last time, it became the western bay of Lake Wayne and then of Lake Warren and Lake Lundy.Chapter XV, Glacial Lake Saginaw; Frank B. Taylor; The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 During its periods as an independent lake, its outlet was west through Grand River channel. First Lake Saginaw Lake Saginaw began after the building of the Flint moraine and the creation of the Imlay channel (from Flint to Maple Rapids) from glacial runoff. When the ice sheet had retreated into the Saginaw basin, exposing land, water began to accumulate and the First Lake Saginaw was formed.Publication 9. Geological Series 7; Surface Geology and Agricultural Conditions of the Southern Peninsula of Michigan; Frank Leverett with a Chapter on Climate by C. F. Schneider; Michigan Geological and Biological Survey Lansing Michigan; 1911 The outlet of the lake was through Grand River to Lake Chicago, which as served the run-off from the glacier. Well-defined beaches surround the outlet at an altitude above sea level, To the north and west, they are higher because of isostatic rebound once the glaciers weight had been removed. The bed of the lake is nearly equally divided between a sandy and a clayey soil. Sand due to lake waves and currents is restricted to the border of the lake, while glacial outwash may be present where there was a considerable depth of water, =Lakes Saginaw and Arkona= When the ice barrier withdrew from the \\"thumb,\\" a strait was opened across its northern low part and the waters on both sides merged at one level, making Lake Arkona and adding to it the area of Lake Saginaw. In this change Lake Saginaw, with its undisturbed outlet, became the controlling factor. The new lake became merely a greatly enlarged Lake Saginaw, using the same outlet and retaining the same shorelines. The Arkona beaches began to be formed. The first one merged with the existing second beach of Lake Saginaw to form a single shore.,Michigan: Bull. Geo. Soc. America, vol. 8, 1896, pp. 53-54. thus the second Saginaw beach merged into the first beach of Lake Arkona. Second Lake Saginaw Second Lake Saginaw - Map of Glacial Lakes Duluth, Chicago, and Lundy (USGS 1915)The ice front advanced from its position as the barrier of Lake Arkona it closed the strait around the \\"thumb\\" and raised the waters east of it about 44 feet, thus inaugurating Lake Whittlesey. The change, however, caused no notable alteration in the discharge from Lake Saginaw, because from its beginning to the time of Lake Arkona Lake Maumee discharged into it, and after Lake Arkona ceased Lake Whittlesey discharged into it. Hence, the volume of water passing out of Lake Saginaw was not affected by the changes. During the time of Lake Whittlesey, therefore, Lake Saginaw had a second period of independent existence with its area almost at a maximum. It seems certain that the lower Arkona ridge of the Saginaw basin was made chiefly by the waves of Lake Arkona, and it seems equally sure that during the time of Lake Whittlesey the waves of Lake Saginaw beat upon this same beach, although nothing clearly establishing this relation has been observed. In the absence of positive evidence one way or the other, these inferences seem natural and necessary. The Later Lake Saginaw extended about to the limits of the First Lake Saginaw on the west and south, for its outlet was through the same channel, along Grand River to Lake Chicago, and at but a few feet lower level. The limits on the northeast or ice-ward side were at the Port Huron moraine, and are thus more definitely fixed than the limits of the Earlier Lake Saginaw. The lake extended up the Cass river valley about to Cass City and up the Tittabawassee valley at least to northeastern Gladwin and possibly into southeastern Ogemaw county. =Lakes Saginaw and Wayne= When the waters fell from Lake Whittlesey they were lowered about 80 feet, not to the Warren beach, as one might suppose, but to the Wayne beach and perhaps later to a lower level. The Wayne beach lies about 20 feet below the Warren and shows modification bj^ submergence after it was made, in this respect resembling the Arkona beaches. There is much reason for thinking that this lake fell to still lower levels before its end. No proof of this has been found, but its outlet was near Syracuse, N. Y., where the situation favored large changes of lake level with relatively small oscillations of the ice front. While Lake Saginaw formed a part of Lake Wayne it abandoned the Grand River channel, its water standing a little below the head of that outlet. =Lakes Saginaw and Warren= When the ice barrier advanced into Lake Wayne, the water rose to the level of the Warren beach. Once again the Grand River became the outlet. Lake Warren has been the name given to this state, with shorelines or lower than the Arkona ridges. =Lakes Saginaw and Lundy (Lake Dana & Lake Elkton)= Lake Lundy followed Lake Warren when a new outlet to the east opened in the Mohawk River Valley. The Grand River outlet was again abandoned for the final time. Lake Saginaw had ended with the onset of the Lake Warren stage. But the opening of a lower outlet along the Mohawk, ended the chance for another independent lake to arise in Saginaw Bay. Grand River Channel The Grand River channel was in use a much longer time than any other channel in Michigan. It began to carry the lake waters when the outlet of Lake Maumee first opened near Imlay, before the beginning of Lake Saginaw. Later it received the discharge from Lake Maumee through the first Lake Saginaw. Next it received the overflow of the merged Lakes Arkona and Saginaw. Later it received the waters of Lake Whittlesey and Saginaw. Only when the ice retreated from the Port Huron morainic system and Lake Saginaw merged again eastward and became part of Lake Wayne was the Grand River channel temporarily abandoned. Through all previous changes, apparently without break or intermission from the first opening of the Imlay outlet, it had carried the overflow. Later the ice advanced, closing the eastern outlet past Syracuse creating Lake Warren, which discharged through the Grand River channel. The Warren beaches lie or above the broad, swampy, dune-covered divide at the head of the channel north of Bannister.

Often, the judges also assumed a political role, being appointed to preside over municipal councils (c√¢maras) in order to provide some central control. History The office arose in Portugal in 1327, under King Afonso IV, as a type of itinerant magistrate, appointed by the Crown. His main function was to ensure compliance with the Law on behalf of the King. The authority of the was far superior to that of ordinary local judges. The appointment of a was justified by the need for a truly free, impartial judge, brought in from outside of the town to guarantee fair trials judge. The position could not be exercised at the place of origin or habitual residence of the magistrate, nor were they allowed other links with the local population such as marriage or close friendship . As part of the process of formation of the structure of the Portuguese State, the Crown invested in the strength of the municipalities and local authorities, in order to weaken the hold of feudal lords. The final consolidation of the office was carried out by King John III in 1532 who undertook a major centralization programme. By 1580, when the Iberian Union emerged with the reign of Philip I of Portugal (Philip II of Spain), there were more than fifty Portuguese municipalities governed by . The office was also later created in the Portuguese Overseas territories, specially in Brazil. In the areas of difficult access and administration of Brazil, the office of was used as a means of control to prevent the adoption of measures conflicting with the interests of the Crown. After the Restoration of the Independence, the Kingdom of Portugal concentrated all its effort in consolidating the newly recovered power, looking not to start unnecessary conflicts and Brazilian municipalities maintained their autonomy until the last years of the seventeenth century. The first in Brazil was appointed in 1696 in Salvador, beginning a transition phase that would last for over a hundred years.

History Kohler Foundation was founded in 1940 by Evangeline Kohler, Marie Christine Kohler, Lillie B. Kohler, Herbert V. Kohler, Sr. and O.A. Kroos. The original stated purpose of the foundation was for programs involving the aged, orphans, infirm, students, victims of floods, famine, epidemics, tornado and other national emergencies. When Marie Kohler died in 1943, her will specified that the major portion of her estate went to the Kohler Foundation. Building projects Marie Christine Kohler was instrumental in construction of the Waelderhaus in the Village of Kohler. It was designed by Austrian architect Kaspar Albrecht and was designed a tribute to the tradition of Bregenzerwald (forest of Bregenz) Province of Vorarlberg, Austria. The name Waelderhaus means forest house. The building was dedicated to the use of the girl scouts and the Kohler Woman's Club upon completion in 1931. The building is currently managed by the Kohler Foundation and is open for tours and is available for events. In 1950, the foundation purchased the Wade House in Greenbush, Wisconsin for the purposes of restoration and preservation. After the restoration was completed, the house was turned over to State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Kohler Memorial The foundation was a major sponsor of the construction of the Kohler Memorial addition to the Kohler public school which opened in 1957. The foundation contributed $300,000. The other major contributors to the project were a trust from the late Governor Kohler worth $500,000, The Village of Kohler, and the Joint School District No. 2. The building cost $1,500,000 to construct and consisted of a grand theater, gymnasium, indoor-outdoor swimming pool, and a youth center. After it was opened, the events for the Distinguished Guest Series were moved to the theater in the building. Also in 1957, The hospital in Plymouth, Wisconsin completed an addition to which the Foundation contributed $60,000 towards construction of the east wing which was named The Kohler Wing. In 1966, the Kohler Foundation gifted the Kohler homestead on New York Avenue in Sheboygan, to the Sheboygan Arts Foundation, Inc. for the establishment of a community arts center. The arts center was named the John Michael Kohler Arts Center. In 1980, the foundation purchased the Painted Forest building in Valton, Wisconsin. The building had been constructed by Modern Woodmen of America in the late 1800s. In 1898 to 1899 the entire interior had been painted in folk art by itinerant artist Ernest H≈±peden. The foundation restored the building and entrusted it to Sauk County, Wisconsin with the Historical Society of the Upper Baraboo Valley acting as custodians. Sauk County returned the site to the foundation in 2001. Additional infrastructure work was completed at the site and in 2004, the Kohler Foundation gifted the Painted Forest to Edgewood College. The foundation also constructed an art studio and study center in Valton and dedicated it to Edgewood in 2005. Arts In 1944 the Kohler Woman's Club established the Distinguished Guest Series, sponsoring concerts, plays and speakers, such as the Salzburg Marionettes, the Robert Shaw Chorale, and the singer William Warfield. In May, 1953, it was announced that the Kohler Foundation would join the Kohler Women's Club as a co-sponsor of the series. This change followed the death of Ruth DeYoung-Kohler in March, 1953. The series continues to run and the 2013‚Äì2014 season is its 70th year. In 1970 the Kohler Foundation, along with the Kohler Company and the estate of Herbert V. Kohler, Sr., contributed funds for the founding of the Kohler Art Library in the newly constructed Elvehjem Art Center at the University of Wisconsin. The total construction cost of the art center was $3.5 million. The art library is still housed in the art center along with Chazen Museum of Art. In 1998, the foundation acquired the home of Loy Allen Bowlin who was known as The Original Rhinestone Cowboy and dismantled and donated it to the John Michael Kohler Art Center where it was reconstructed and is preserved as a folk art treasure. Scholarships The Kohler family has a history of funding college scholarship dating to 1927 when the Kohler Family Scholarships were established. An amount of $10,000 in each of two endowment funds, one for boys and one for girls. The initial amount of the scholarship was a total of no more than $500 to each recipient. This fund was administered by the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. The endowment was increased in 1943 by an additional $10,000 by the estate of Marie Kolher. The funds in the scholarship endowments are periodically increased by the Kohler Foundation. In 1955, the Kohler Foundation began financing a resident graduate fellowship program called the Marie Christine Kohler Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin. The students in the program were housed in the former governor's mansion known as the Knapp House. The program was housed there until 2012. The foundation continues to support the graduate fellowships at university's Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID). The fund is currently known as the Marie Christine Kohler Fellows @ WID. Fellows receive an annual stipend of $3,000.  Other funding  The Foundation and the Kohler family has also supported the efforts of the International Crane Foundation by funding education and research and aiding with transportation. In 1978, the Patrick and Anna M. Cudahy Fund and Kohler Foundation, Inc. supported a full-time educator. Funding was also given for crane habitat studies in China. In the late 1990s members of the family began transporting Siberian crane eggs between Asia and Baraboo with company jets and continued to do so for a number of years.

The left pattern is produced by head/tail breaks, while the right one by natural breaks, also known as Jenks natural breaks optimization. Head/tail breaks is a clustering algorithm scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution such as power laws and lognormal distributions. The heavy-tailed distribution can be simply referred to the scaling pattern of far more small things than large ones, or alternatively numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest. The classification is done through dividing things into large (or called the head) and small (or called the tail) things around the arithmetic mean or average, and then recursively going on for the division process for the large things or the head until the notion of far more small things than large ones is no longer valid, or with more or less similar things left only.Jiang, Bin (2013). \\"Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution\\", The Professional Geographer, 65 (3), 482 ‚Äì 494. Head/tail breaks is not just for classification, but also for visualization of big data by keeping the head, since the head is self-similar to the whole. Head/tail breaks can be applied not only to vector data such as points, lines and polygons, but also to raster data like digital elevation model (DEM). Motivation The head/tail breaks is mainly motivated by inability of conventional classification methods such as equal intervals, quantiles, geometric progressions, standard deviation, and natural breaks - commonly known as Jenks natural breaks optimization or k-means clustering for revealing the underlying scaling pattern of far more small things than large ones. Note that the notion of far more small things than large one is not only referred to geometric property, but also to topological and semantic properties. In this connection, the notion should be interpreted as far more unpopular (or less-connected) things than popular (or well-connected) ones, or far more meaningless things than meaningful ones. Head/tail breaks uses the mean or average as a method to separate between smaller and larger things. Head/tail breaks do not characterize with average values, like with the previously mentioned classical methods (k-means clustering, natural breaks), but uses them only to differentiate. This allows scale-free things, like fractals, to be analysed regardless of lacking meaningful averages. This opens new avenues of analyzing data besides the widely known methods which are characterizing data through their mean values. Method Given some variable X that demonstrates a heavy-tailed distribution, there are far more small x than large ones. Take the average of all xi, and obtain the first mean m1. Then calculate the second mean for those xi greater than m1, and obtain m2. In the same recursive way, we can get m3 depending on whether the ending condition of no longer far more small x than large ones is met. For simplicity, we assume there are three means, m1, m2, and m3. This classification leads to four classes: [minimum, m1], (m1, m2], (m2, m3], (m3, maximum]. In general, it can be represented as a recursive function as follows: Recursive function Head/tail Breaks: Rank the input data values from the biggest to the smallest; Compute the mean value of the data Break the data (around the mean) into the head and the tail; // the head for data values greater the mean // the tail for data values less the mean while (length(head)/length(data) <=40%): Head/tail Breaks(head); End Function The resulting number of classes is referred to as ht-index, an alternative index to fractal dimension for characterizing complexity of fractals or geographic features: the higher the ht-index, the more complex the fractals.Jiang, Bin and Yin Junjun (2014). \\"Ht-index for quantifying the fractal or scaling structure of geographic features\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 104(3), 530‚Äì541. = Threshold or its sensitivity = The criterion to stop the iterative classification process using the head/tail breaks method is that the remaining data (i.e., the head part) are not heavy- tailed, or simply, the head part is no longer a minority (i.e., the proportion of the head part is no longer less than a threshold such as 40%). This threshold is suggested to be 40% by Jiang et al. (2013), just as the codes above (i.e., (length/head)/length(data) ‚â§ 40%). This process is called head/tail breaks 1.0. But sometimes a larger threshold, for example 50% or more, can be used, as Jiang and Yin (2014) noted in another article: \\"this condition can be relaxed for many geographic features, such as 50 percent or even more\\". However, all heads' percentage on average must be smaller than 40% (or 41, 42%), indicating far more small things than large ones. Many real- world data cannot be fit into a perfect long tailed distribution, therefore its threshold can be relaxed structurally. In head/tail breaks 2.0 the threshold only applies to the overall heads' percentage.Jiang, B. (2019). A recursive definition of goodness of space for bridging the concepts of space and place for sustainability. Sustainability, 11(15), 4091. https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.01073.pdf This means that the percentages of all heads related to the tails should be around 40% on average. Individual classes can have any percentage spit around the average, as long as this averages out as a whole. For example, if there is data distributed in such a way that it has a clearly defined head and tail during the first and second iteration (length(head)/(length(data)<20%) but a much less well defined long tailed distribution for the third iteration (60% in the head), head/tail breaks 2.0 allows the iteration to continue into the fourth iteration which can be distributed 30% head - 70% tail again and so on. As long as the overall threshold is not surpassed the head/tail breaks classification holds. = Rank-size plot and RA index = A good tool to display the scaling pattern, or the heavy-tailed distribution, is the rank-size plot, which is a scatter plot to display a set of values according to their ranks. With this tool, a new index termed as the ratio of areas (RA) in a rank-size plot was defined to characterize the scaling pattern. The RA index has been successfully used in the estimation of traffic conditions. However, the RA index can only be used as a complementary method to the ht-index, because it is ineffective to capture the scaling structure of geographic features. = Other Indices based on the head/tail breaks = In addition to the ht-index, the following indices are also derived with the head/tail breaks. * CRG-index. It is developed as a more sensitive ht-index to capture the slight changes of geographic features. In contrast to the ht-index, which is an integer, CRG-index is a real number. * Unified metrics. Two unified metrics (UM1 and UM2) were proposed in an AAAG paper for characterizing the fractal nature of geographic features. One can be used to answer the question of ‚ÄúI know there are far more small things than large ones, but how small (or large) are these small (or large) things?‚Äù, whereas the other one to answer ‚ÄúI know there are far more small things than large ones, but how many more?‚Äù * Fht-index: It is a fractional ht-index, which is able to capture fractional hierarchy. The fht-index might be of help for creating an intermediate scale between two consecutive map scales, leading to so called continuous map scales. Applications Instead of more or less similar things, there are far more small things than large ones surrounding us. Given the ubiquity of the scaling pattern, head/tail breaks is found to be of use to statistical mapping, map generalization, cognitive mapping and even perception of beauty .Jiang, Bin, Liu, Xintao and Jia, Tao (2013). \\"Scaling of geographic space as a universal rule for map generalization\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 103(4), 844 ‚Äì 855.Jiang, Bin (2013b). \\"The image of the city out of the underlying scaling of city artifacts or locations\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 103(6), 1552-1566.Jiang, Bin and Sui, Daniel (2014). \\"A new kind of beauty out of the underlying scaling of geographic space\\", The Professional Geographer, 66(4), 676‚Äì686 It helps visualize big data, since big data are likely to show the scaling property of far more small things than large ones. The visualization strategy is to recursively drop out the tail parts until the head parts are clear or visible enough.Jiang, Bin (2015). \\"Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics\\", Cities, 43, 69 - 77. In addition, it helps delineate cities or natural cities to be more precise from various geographic information such as street networks, social media geolocation data, and nighttime images. = Characterizing the imbalance = As the head/tail breaks method can be used iteratively to obtain head parts of a data set, this method actually captures the underlying hierarchy of the data set. For example, if we divide the array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) with the head/tail breaks method, we can get two head parts, i.e., the first head part (19, 8, 7, 6) and the second head part (19). These two head parts as well as the original array form a three-level hierarchy: the 1st level (19), the 2nd level (19, 8, 7, 6), and the 3rd level (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0). The number of levels of the above-mentioned hierarchy is actually a characterization of the imbalance of the example array, and this number of levels has been termed as the ht-index. With the ht-index, we are able to compare degrees of imbalance of two data sets. For example, the ht-index of the example array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) is 3, and the ht-index of another array (19, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8) is 2. Therefore, the degree of imbalance of the former array is higher than that of the latter array. The left panel pattern contains 50,000 natural cities, which can be put into 7 hierarchical levels. It looks like a hair ball. Instead of showing all the 7 hierarchical levels, we show 4 top levels, by dropping out 3 low levels. Now with the right panel, the scaling pattern of far more small cities than large ones emerges. It is important to note that the right pattern (or the remaining part after dropping out the tails) is self-similar to the whole (or the left pattern). Thus the right pattern reflects the underlying structure of the left one, and enables us to see the whole. The scaling pattern of US terrain surface is distorted by the natural breaks, but revealed by the head/tail breaks. = Delineating natural cities = The term ‚Äònatural cities‚Äô refers to the human settlements or human activities in general on Earth's surface that are naturally or objectively defined and delineated from massive geographic information based on head/tail division rule, a non- recursive form of head/tail breaks.Jiang, Bin and Miao, Yufan (2015). \\"The evolution of natural cities from the perspective of location-based social media\\", The Professional Geographer, 67(2), 295 - 306.Long, Ying (2016). \\"Redefining Chinese city system with emerging new data\\", Applied Geography, 75, 36 - 48. Such geographic information could be from various sources, such as massive street junctions and street ends, a massive number of street blocks, nighttime imagery and social media users‚Äô locations etc. Distinctive from conventional cities, the adjective ‚Äònatural‚Äô could be explained not only by the sources of natural cities, but also by the approach to derive them. Natural cities are derived from a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive number of units extracted from geographic information. Those units vary according to different kinds of geographic information, for example the units could be area units for the street blocks and pixel values for the nighttime images. A natural cities model has been created using ArcGIS model builder,Ren, Zheng (2016). \\"Natural cities model in ArcGIS\\", http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=47b1d6fdd1984a6fae916af389cdc57d. it follows the same process of deriving natural cities from location-based social media, namely, building up huge triangular irregular network (TIN) based on the point features (street nodes in this case) and regarding the triangles which are smaller than a mean value as the natural cities. These natural cities can also be created from other open access information like OpenStreetMap and further be used as an alternative delineation of administrative boundaries. Scaling law can also at the same time correctly be identified and the administrative borders can be created to respect this by the delineation of the natural cities. = Color rendering DEM = Current color renderings for DEM or density map are essentially based on conventional classifications such as natural breaks or equal intervals, so they disproportionately exaggerate high elevations or high densities. As a matter of fact, there are not so many high elevations or high-density locations.Jiang, Bin (2015). \\"Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity\\", GeoJournal, 80(1), 1-13. It was found that coloring based head/tail breaks is more favorable than those by other classifications Wu, Jou-Hsuan (2015). \\"Examining the new kind of beauty using the human being as a measuring instrument\\", http://www.diva- portal.org/smash/get/diva2:805296/FULLTEXT01.pdf. = Further applications = Other applications of Head/tail breaks: * Serving as a method for efficiently estimating the absolute bolzman entropy of numerical raster data * Quantifying the multiscale representation of a polyline *Increasing computational efficiency in flow data analysis by emphasising the head part of the flow dataset *Temporal analysis of urban expansion related to the thermal environment *Image analysis where anisotropy is measured in point patterns extracted with a digital pulse transform with the use of head/tail breaks *Visualizing and analyzing spatial patterns in bilateral trade *To identify urban function graphs, note that this paper applies head/tail breaks on a gaussian kernel density estimation which reduces the accuracy of the head/tail breaks method. Essentially a natural cities approach is taken but the initial data chosen to perform head/tail breaks on has been reduced beforehand. For a better representation of urban function graphs head/tail breaks may be applied as the first step in delineating these areas. *Analyzing structures or hotspots naturally occurring within data to highlight areas of interest (Based on natural cities). (Over)Tourism analysis based on short term rentals (like AirBnB) by creating hotspots out of the distribution of rented out apartments. *Head/tail breaks can serve as a main indicator that phenomena are distributed long tailed and that paretian thinking should favor gaussian thinking in geographic spaces. For example within biodiversity and pedodiversity studies where there seem to be fractal relationships such as taxa-area relationships. Complementary to this the polygons of soil and vegetation maps also show scaling within their structures. This can be identified and highlighted by using head/tail breaks.

She was educated at the High School of Dundee until the family migrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1889, where she then attended Brunswick Ladies College. Her father encouraged his children to pursue tertiary education, and in 1891 both she and her sister Jane enrolled at the medical school of the University of Melbourne. She graduated from the University , with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery with honours in 1895. Career The following year, she and Alfreda Gamble were appointed resident medical officers at Melbourne Hospital, making them the first two women to fill such a role at the hospital and against considerable opposition from the hospital staff. She later became the first female anaesthetist in the state of Victoria, serving as an honorary anaesthetist at the Royal Women's Hospital during 1900-1917. During World War I, Greig volunteered to work as a medical officer at a military hospital in Melbourne, but was told that there was \\"no necessity for lady doctors in the military hospitals\\"; instead, she was recruited to examine nurses for military service. For many years, Greig ran a private practice in Fitzroy, Victoria and worked as a consultant from Collins Street, Melbourne. She was one of the founding members of the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women and Children and was an honorary medical staff member there for 54 years. When a new pathology wing was constructed at the hospital in 1937, it was named after Greig.

Location  Balnearium lithotrophicum was recently found in the Suiyo Seamount and isolated as its own species. Suiyo Seamount is found off the east coast of Japan in an underwater volcano. This underwater volcano vent release gases and heat into the deep ocean at 1,418 m deep. These vents create new ecosystems where little other life live. There are many microbes that thrive in these extreme conditions known as thermophiles. The Balnearium lithotrophicum lives near the vent but not directly on it. At the source of the vent temperatures can be up to 290 ¬∞C but where the Balnearium lithotrophicum thrives, temperatures are around 70‚Äì75 ¬∞C. This classifies Balnearium lithotrophicum as a thermophile because it thrives in relatively extreme heat and pressure conditions.  Environment  At this depth, there is no light and little oxygen, so Balnearium lithotrophicum is an obligate anaerobe bacterium. An obligate anaerobe is a bacterium that cannot survive in the presence of oxygen that is found in the atmosphere. Balnearium lithotrophicum is identified as a chemolithoautotroph, ‚Äúeater of rock‚Äù, that reduces strictly inorganic compounds in order to survive. It gets its energy from metabolizing hydrogen from the black smoker chimney. The carbon source it uses to survive comes from the carbon dioxide in the water. Balnearium lithotrophicum can live in a pH between 5.0 and 7.0 but prefers 5.4. In addition, for growth the NaCl amount in the water should be between 0.8 and 5.6 percent. Ammonium is the main nitrogen source of Balnearium lithotrophicum. The genomic DNA had 34.6 mol% of C+G bases.  Classification  The appearance of the Balnearium lithotrophicum is a short rod that is narrower in the middle. These organisms have been known to exist in this submarine ecosystem; however, Balnearium lithotrophicum was only recently separated from similar extremophiles. The close relatives it was divided from include Thermovibrio ruber and Desulfurobacterium thermolithotrophum. They share many features but were separated based on certain physiological characteristics that Balnearium lithotrophicum maintains.

Its lowbrow, populist films appealed to local audiences and were highly successful in Argentina and throughout Latin America. It was the main competitor to Argentina Sono Film in the 1940s. After World War II (1939‚Äì45) Lumiton faced increased government regulation, rising costs and loss of audiences to more sophisticated Hollywood productions. The company was forced to close in 1952. Foundation The four founders of LOR Radio Argentina, who went on to found Lumiton Lumiton was founded in the town of Munro, Buenos Aires, with an initial capital of 300,000 pesos. The name \\"Lumiton\\" is made from the words for \\"light\\" and \\"sound\\". The full name was \\"Sociedad An√≥nima Radio Cinematogr√°fica Lumiton\\" (Lumiton Radio Cinematography Company Ltd.) The founders had earlier pioneered radio broadcast in Argentina, and were now pioneering sound films. They had made one of the first radio broadcasts in the world in August 1920 from the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires. They were C√©sar Jos√© Guerrico, Enrique T. Susini, Luis Romero Carranza and Miguel Mujica. The first Lumiton studio was built with a modern laboratory and technical facilities on property owned by Isabel Zeller de Lehan. A complete crew was hired in the United States. This included the director of photography John Alton, and the sound designer Lazlo Kish. The state was not involved in the film industry, either directly or through subsidies. Without the same bargaining power as the big Hollywood studios, the local studios could not demand a share of receipts from the distributors, but had to sell their films for a flat rate and therefore had to keep costs and capital expenditures to the minimum. In the early years, Lumiton's audience was struggling with the effect of the Great Depression of the 1930, but the cheap and lighthearted productions perhaps helped people escape from their problems. There are distinct regional dialects in Latin America. Castilian Spanish is often not easy for local people to understand. Subtitling would not work with the audiences of the 1930s, many of whom were semi-literate. This created demand for locally produced sound films. Lumiton employed local actors experienced in radio or popular theater. Although locally made films were not as technically slick as those from Hollywood, films with local actors, themes and settings appealed to local audiences. Lumiton became known for its lowbrow tango films. Carlos Gardel (1890‚Äì1935) made tango popular throughout Latin America, and this created a large export market for Lumiton's films. Growth poster for Los tres berretines (1933), the studio's first film Lumitron began operation on 17 December 1932, producing several test short films. The logo and opening sequence of each film featured a huge gong sounded by Michael Borowsky, the main dancer of the Teatro Col√≥n. Lumiton's first feature was Los tres berretines (The Three Hobbies, 1933) directed by Enrique T. Susini and starring the local actors Luis Sandrini and Luisa Vehil. Alton was not credited but may have played and important role in direction and cinematography. Los tres berretines was released on 19 May 1933. The film cost 18,000 pesos and earned over one million. The film depicted a family whose members were obsessed with the three national \\"berretines\\" (interests or hobbies) of tango, football and cinema. Sandrini's performance made him the first local cinema star. Poster for Los martes, orqu√≠deas (1941) In 1935 the director Manuel Romero joined the studio. He made one of Lumitron's great successes, the musical Noches de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Nights, 1935), with Tita Merello and Fernando Ochoa. He also directed the musical El caballo del pueblo (The Favorite). His next film for Lumiton, La muchachada de a bordo (Boys on Board, 1936), was a major popular success. Romero made populist genre films for Lumiton including the film noir Fuera de la ley (Outside the Law, 1938), the romantic comedy La rubia del camino (The Blonde on the Road, 1938) and Mujeres que trabajan (Women Who Work, 1938). Mujeres que trabajan included Nin√≠ Marshall in her first film role. It was unusual in depicting women in the workplace, but otherwise was a conventional romantic melodrama. Marshall emerged as a strong and original comedian, and starred in a series of Lumiton films in the years that followed. Romero was the main film director for Lumiton until 1943, and directed over half the studio's films. Formerly a tango lyricist and musical variety show director, he turned out cheerful and predictable comedies aimed at working class audiences. Romero always treated the working poor as a dignified community deserving respect. The critics looked down on his work, with its melodramatic plots and happy endings, but the films had great appeal to his audience. These successful films, and those of other Argentine studios in the √©poca de oro (golden age) spurred Hollywood to produce Spanish-language films for the Latin American market, but without much success. La chismosa (The Gossip, 1937), directed by Enrique Susini, was the first film made in Latin America to earn an honorable mention at a European film festival, in Venice. Margarita, Armando y su padre (1939), directed by Francisco M√∫gica, was also mentioned in Venice. The Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences, founded in 1941, gave its first awards the next year. Lumiton won the prize for best picture with Los martes, orqu√≠deas, a comedy. The writers, Sixto Pondal R√≠os and Carlos A. Olivari, and the lead actress, Mirtha Legrand, were also recognized. By 1942 the film industry in Argentina was the most technically advanced in South America. Lumiton and other majors such as Argentina Sono Film and Artistas Argentinos Asociados were at their peak. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Argentina was careful not to upset the Axis powers, and banned or forced changes to some American films. Banned films included The Invaders (1941), Secret Agent of Japan (1942) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943). In response the United States banned the export of unexposed film to Argentina, despite lack of evidence that the privately held studios were producing films or newsreels sympathetic to the Axis. Since supplies could not be obtained from Germany, the film industry suffered. Lumiton and Argentina Sono Film were the only studios with enough stock to last a year, and film makers had to rely on expensive black market supplies from Brazil or Chile. Last years Former Lumiton film studios, now a museum, in 2009 The focus by Lumiton and other Argentine studios on populist local themes was in contrast to the more sophisticated offerings from Hollywood, and appealed more to working-class people than to the elite. However, the studios avoided depicting real social issues and struggles. For two decades Lumiton made films that were shown throughout Latin America with great success, but by the 1950s local cinema was losing audiences to foreign productions with more modern and relevant subjects. Ra√∫l Apold, Juan Per√≥n's undersecretary of culture, implemented an authoritarian regime of film censorship. The industry was suffering from declining demand, rising costs and shortages of raw material. Apold added burdensome regulation. By the early 1950s Lumiton was in severe financial difficulties. The studio's last completed film was the feature Reportaje en el infierno, made by Rom√°n Vi√±oly Barreto in 1951‚Äì52, and only released in 1959. On 5 May 1952 Lucas Demare began shooting Un guapo del 900, but when it was in its second week of filming Lumiton filed for bankruptcy. A museum was built in 2004 to house memorabilia of the film company in the former studios in Munro, in the municipality of Vicente L√≥pez. It holds cameras, sets, pictures and posters.

Management of EMI In early 1954, he was approached by Sir Edward de Stein to join the board of EMI, and he became its chairman on his fiftieth birthday later in the year. At the time, EMI was losing some ¬£0.5 million per year and was on the verge of bankruptcy. \\"Q&A; Session: Sir Joseph Lockwood\\", Billboard, 26 December 1974, p.51. Retrieved 1 June 2014 He instigated a run-down of the gramophone and radio manufacturing side of the company, giving it a greater focus on industrial electronic equipment through a partnership with Thorn Electrical Industries. He also started to oversee substantial growth in EMI's involvement in the record industry, buying and developing the American Capitol company in the late 1950s,Stuart Shea and Robert Rodriguez, Fab Four FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Beatles ... and More!, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007, pp.340-341 and appointing George Martin to take charge of the Parlophone label. Philip Norman, Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation, Simon and Schuster, 2011 edition By 1960, EMI's annual profits were some ¬£5 million. Joseph Lockwood was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1960 New Year Honours list. He prioritised the production and sale of popular records, rather than classical records aimed at a prestige market. He also changed marketing and distribution arrangements; previously, only a small handful of record shops in Britain had been permitted to sell EMI records, and Lockwood pioneered new ways of ensuring the rapid distribution of hit records to shops. By 1973, EMI was reported to be the largest record company in the world. Lockwood also led the involvement of EMI in the British film industry. Lockwood was regarded as close to the Beatles, who generated a large share of EMI's profits during the 1960s. It has been suggested that his relationship with the group was eased because both he and the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein were both Jewish and gay. Lockwood occasionally intervened personally in areas of dispute, for example to insist on the release of the \\"Penny Lane\\" / \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" single, and in ensuring that the Beatles rather than EMI would be held legally responsible if there were objections from celebrities pictured on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper album. He was seen as willing to overlook \\"eccentricities\\" such as their drug use, saying \\"I never pursued it... largely because they were so successful\\". However, he refused to allow EMI to distribute the Two Virgins album because of its controversial sleeve design. Later years and death Lockwood retired as chairman of EMI in 1974. He died at his home in Buckinghamshire in 1991 at the age of 86.

Druga godba () is one of the most important music festivals in Central Europe. Its concept, variety of new approaches and enthusiasm for less well-known music from across the globe is unique to this part of the world.  History  Druga godba Festival was established in 1984 in Ljubljana. Its programme was primarily concerned with different kinds of varieties in music: alternative rock, rock in opposition, adventurous new jazz, improvised music and experimental music, as well as rediscovered Slovenian folk music. Druga godba was the first festival in the former Yugoslavia to introduce popular musics and styles from the Third World, including reggae and various styles of African music. In 1990 the Druga Godba organisation became a member of the European Forum of Worldwide Music Festivals (EFWMF). This is a network of 43 festivals and 13 associate council members from 20 European countries, and incorporates a wide range of European world music festivals of the very highest quality. Druga godba won a ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç Award in 2006 for an original festival concept. In May 2008 Druga godba worked with the Slovenian Tourist Board on a campaign to promote Slovenia in the United States. Two special musical events were organised in New York City in collaboration with National Geographic Traveler ‚Äì the first in Joe‚Äôs Pub, the legendary jazz venue, which played host to the group Godalika and guests, as well as Fake Orchestra, and the second at the Town Hall, with a concert which featured Laibach, Bratko Bibiƒç and Guy Klucevsek, Vasko Atanasovski, Marc Ribot and Greg Cohen, Brina, Zlatko Kauƒçiƒç, Silence and Katalena. Every year since 2011, Druga godba has been selected as one of the 25 best international festivals in the world by the British world music magazine Songlines.

It was written and directed by Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell and produced by Galyn Susman. Michael Giacchino composed the music for the special. Most of the regular cast from the Toy Story series reprised their roles, including Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Kristen Schaal as Trixie, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and Joan Cusack as Jessie, with Kevin McKidd and Emma Hudak joining as new characters Reptillus Maximus and Angel Kitty, respectively. The special was Rickles' final project that he completed before his death on April 6, 2017, and was the last Toy Story production for five years until the release of Toy Story 4 on June 21, 2019. The film received critical acclaim. Plot During a post- Christmas playdate, Trixie is sad that Bonnie never depicts her as a dinosaur when they play. Bonnie later takes Trixie, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, and aphorism-spouting Christmas ornament Angel Kitty to her best friend Mason's house for a play date. Bonnie ends up tossing the toys into Mason's playroom to join Mason in playing with his video game console. Bonnie's toys discover the playroom is dominated by \\"Battlesaurs\\", a huge dinosaur-themed playset that Mason received for Christmas, led by warrior Reptillus Maximus and The Cleric. Trixie is delighted to interact with them as a dinosaur. She and Rex are armed as warriors, unaware that Woody and Buzz have been taken prisoners. Reptillus and Trixie quickly grow close, but it is soon revealed that the Battlesaurs have not yet been played with, and therefore do not know that they are toys. To Trixie's horror, Mason's other toys are violently attacked in an arena. Woody and Buzz are then brought in to fight, but Trixie defends them. The Cleric denounces Trixie for bearing Bonnie's name on her foot; she flees to get Bonnie's help, and Reptillus is sent after her. She shows him his own toy package, which enrages him. In the arena, the Cleric takes control of Rex's robotic armaments and forces him to seize Woody and Buzz. They realize the Cleric is aware of Mason and their status as toys; with Mason preoccupied by the video game, the Cleric maintains authoritarian control over the Battlesaurs, and apparently, the playroom. The Cleric intends to destroy Woody, Buzz, and Angel Kitty by tossing them in the air vent. In Mason's bedroom, Reptillus confronts Trixie as she is about to deactivate the video game. She convinces him that \\"surrendering\\" to a child for playtime will broaden his horizons, and he reluctantly turns the game off. Mason finds Reptillus, and Bonnie begins playing with him, which convinces Mason to do the same. The children return to the playroom just in time to unknowingly save Woody and Buzz, and they play with the Battlesaurs and other toys in a variety of non-combat settings. Reptillus calls the experience \\"glorious\\". Back in Bonnie's room, Trixie tells the other toys that she is \\"Bonnie's dinosaur\\", and is happy in every role Bonnie has for her. Angel Kitty gives one last moral and inexplicably vanishes. During the credits, Reptillus happily bears Mason's name on his hand and looks forward to seeing Trixie at Mason and Bonnie's next playdate, already scheduled for the following week. Cast Kristen Schaal as Trixie a toy Triceratops * Tom Hanks as Woody, a cowboy doll * Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, a toy Space Ranger * Kevin McKidd as Reptillus Maximus, a dinosaur action figure * Emily Hahn as Bonnie * Wallace Shawn as Rex, a toy Tyrannosaurus rex * Steve Purcell as The Cleric, the leader of the Battlesaurs * Jonathan Kydd as Ray-gon * R.C.

The special took three years to make, with two years spent on story development. The team took time to design the Battlesaurs as if they were a real cartoon and toy line. The story was made in three acts. In the UK, Toy Story That Time Forgot was broadcast by Sky Movies and aired on December 6, 2014, four days after the US' air date. The TV special was also broadcast on Channel 4 and then later sister channel E4 in 2017. Marketing The first look poster for Toy Story That Time Forgot, created by comics artist Mike Mignola, was released at Comic Con 2014. Home media Toy Story That Time Forgot was released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 3, 2015. Bundled with the physical copies is a fake intro to the Battlesaurs cartoon, animated by the Japanese production company Studio Trigger.  Reception  The special received 6.79 million viewers, and received acclaim from critics. On Disney Channel, it received 3.27 million viewers, making it the most-watched broadcast on the network that night. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics have given the special a positive review based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.92/10. At Metacritic, the special has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". IGN said, \\"Toy Story That Time Forgot may not have time for the addicting sentiment that we've grown accustomed to with these characters, but it's still a lot of fun.\\" CinemaBlend rated it 4.5 out of 5, saying \\"Delivering the humor, heart and toy-filled adventure that we've come to expect from the Toy Story franchise, Toy Story That Time Forgot is another wonderful, entertaining and playful installment to the franchise, and well worth a watch for kids and kids-at-heart.\\" References External links  2010s American animated films American films 2014 television films 2014 television specials American Broadcasting Company television specials American animated short films American television films Christmas television specials Dinosaur films 2014 computer-animated films Films scored by Michael Giacchino Disney television specials Toy Story 2010s American television specials 2010s Christmas films 2014 short films ","title":"Toy Story That Time Forgot"},{"id":"42933436","text":"Uusi Lahti is a free newspaper published in Lahti, Finland, and distributed in Lahti and nearby communities.

In 1959, he broke away from a career as a commercial illustrator, which began in 1933, to pursue Impressionist painting. He was a prolific painter, often compared stylistically to Monet, and art critics agreed Thompson was a master of color and light. \\"Thompson's great appreciation for nature is observed in his landscapes that represent a point in time that has both a sense of history and eternity. The artist found beauty all around him; It was as nearby as his favorite fishing hole or a neighbor's backyard. In these simple yet intimate places, Thompson reminded others to take time to stop and take another look.\\" Early years Thompson was born at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois. Richard's father, Abijah Snyder Thompson, was an illustrator and commercial art director for Montgomery Ward in Chicago. At a young age Thompson was introduced to many of his father‚Äôs colleagues, sparking an early interest in the arts. He started to draw pencil sketches at age eight after watching his father draw at home in the evening. Richard's father also shared with his son his love for fishing and nature. When it was seasonable, they would travel from Chicago to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on weekend fishing trips. The nature scenes he observed on these excursions became subjects for his sketches. At age ten, Richard awoke a couple of hours before his parents on Christmas morning to find a gift with his name under the Christmas tree. Upon opening, he found it to be his own paint box together with canvas board, brushes, and paints. He set up a still life with an apple, orange, and a piece of drapery fabric from his mother‚Äôs sewing room. He painted for about two hours, and when his parents awoke they saw Richard‚Äôs first finished painting. They were so proud of his achievement that it served to intensify his desire to paint. His mother, Vera Thompson, was interested in the arts and music and encouraged Richard as a vocalist. He had already started to develop a career as a boy soprano by age ten and sang on the Blue Network on NBC's The National Farm and Home Hour radio program. Opportunities for further vocal training arose, but with his changing voice and his interest in art, Thompson made a decision to pursue art rather than music. Education Thompson's mother was instrumental in furthering his art interests, taking him to the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where she introduced him to Carl Werntz, the school owner and director. After Werntz looked at sketches by Richard, he was invited to enter day school. However, he was only fifteen and already had a diversified but tightly scheduled boyhood. He was looking forward to attending high school and playing football and could only consider art school on Saturdays. Before making the decision he wrote to two American Impressionist painters he admired, Edward Redfield and George Gardner Symons, who became known as leaders of the Impressionist clan. Both wrote back giving him encouragement and advice. Unlike his father, Richard did not yearn to be an illustrator or art director. His desire was to pursue the fine arts he had seen in Chicago exhibitions. He and his father spent a great deal of time talking about paintings and artists and attending every exhibit that came to Chicago. One exhibition of Aldro Hibbard at the Carson Pirie Scott & Co. department store stood out in his mind and had enormous impact on his career. The public also appreciated the exhibition, as it sold out in two days. In 1929, the stock market crashed on Wall Street, leading to a worldwide economic depression. The Depression drastically changed the art world and put an abrupt end to the Impressionist movement to make way for a new direction called Modernism. In 1930, Thompson, age 16, entered both Oak Park High School and art school at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, attending on Saturdays during the school year and day classes during the summer. Painter Frederick Milton Grant, who was a student of William Merritt Chase, was a mentor to Richard. He was surrounded by members of the Hoosier Group, a group of Impressionist painters who painted the Indiana landscape. He watched Carl Krafft, John Spellman, Jess Hobby, and Charles Dahlgren paint canvas after canvas. Richard often visited Hobby in his Oak Park studio and learned additional painting techniques not taught by Grant. In 1932, Thompson, age 18, entered art school for a two-year term at the American Academy of Art in Chicago. There were 21 instructors and 400 students. The academy had a reputation for training competent illustrators and designers. He was most inspired by two of them ‚Äì Edmund Kellogg and Frederick Milton Grant. Thompson now saw his future career path temporarily shift to illustrator during the Depression economy. Commercial illustrator In 1933, after graduating from Oak Park High School, Richard‚Äôs first job was with Esquire as a commercial artist. At night he was a student of Louis Ritman at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. At work he was learning the routine required of a commercial artist and at school he was learning both commercial and easel painting techniques. He knew the desire to launch a fine arts career would have to wait. The next twenty-six years, 1933-1959, would be the duration of his commercial art career in illustration. He joined with a layout man, Walter Wenzel, and together they freelanced as commercial artists. Thompson‚Äôs next job was with a large studio in Chicago, Vogue-Wright Studios. In addition to freelancing in the ad business, he taught at the American Academy of Art in 1935-37. During this period, in 1936, Thompson met the woman with whom he would share his life and career. In 1937, after dating for one year, Mary Munn and Richard married. They had three sons, Richard Earl Jr., Thomas Daniel, and Robert Bruce, who all became integral to supporting and inspiring their father‚Äôs career as a fine art American Impressionist. Chicago was filled with illustrators, and the advertising business was a competitive, stress-filled life with sixteen-hour workdays. However, Thompson felt it was important to maintain the life he and his family enjoyed living in Wisconsin, so he commuted 150 miles by train daily. Thompson worked in the studio of Haddon Sundblom creating ad campaigns for Coca-Cola that graced the back covers of The Saturday Evening Post. Thompson painted much of the original material, and Sundblom put on the finish. Thompson remembers Sundblom as a great talent and continued to work for him during the war years until 1944. In the mid-forties and fifties, Thompson owned and operated his own studio and advertising business in Chicago. He went back to freelancing with friend and fellow artist, Jim Sigmund. The twosome created hundreds of trade ads. During this time Thompson was commissioned by the United States Treasury Department to paint war bond posters. He worked on large advertising and promotional campaigns for Coca- Cola, Anheuser-Busch, Standard Oil, Miller Brewing Company, and many other firms until 1959. During this time he kept a watchful eye on the American art scene, never giving up his desire to become a fine art painter. Fine art painter In 1959, illustrations in commercial art were being replaced by photography. Thompson now had reason to become a fine arts painter. At forty- five he gave up a handsome salary and commercial art career to pursue what he had set out to do when he was fifteen years old ‚Äì paint. Talent, courage, inspiration, and family support enabled him to make his final break from commercial art. The next seventeen years, 1960-1977, were spent traveling, painting, and establishing representation in galleries throughout the United States. Richard and his wife Mary traveled by car to Arizona and he would set up an easel on the side of the road to paint in plein air style. Travel also included a trip to Portugal, Spain, and France in 1970 with his youngest son Bruce, who is a photographer. Richard's desire was to experience the light quality and essence of the countryside painted by the great European Impressionists he admired. Richard and Bruce visited the Louvre in Paris and the Prado in Madrid. As a result of the trip, a show was produced and well received by the public at a one-man exhibition at Veldman Art Gallery in Milwaukee. Two years later, in 1972, father and son traveled to Israel and France to gather new material for future paintings. Another new body of paintings was produced from the second trip. Trips within the U.S. included the vividly colored New England states in the fall and the beautiful spring budding of the Southeast. Impressionism had fallen out of popularity, so Thompson needed to convince his prospective dealers that his work would sell. He was confident his work had merit and strove to express himself artistically by relying on years of extensive training. He continued to work hard, even experimenting with painting styles other than Impressionism, but he was not satisfied. The art he had loved as a boy was in his heart and soul. He knew nothing else would have sincerity. In 1977, since he was successfully showing and selling his paintings in eight notable U.S. galleries, he felt he couldn‚Äôt spread himself much thinner. He seemed to be spending more time framing, crating, and shipping than painting. The market for his paintings had grown every year, and he wondered how could he keep up with the demand. He found himself at a crossroads and contemplated his next move. Thompson‚Äôs oldest son Richard Jr. offered his expertise in sales. His solution to the dilemma facing his father was to establish a business plan and start his own gallery. The Richard Thompson Gallery at 80 Maiden Lane in San Francisco, California, was opened in an upscale shopping district of the city. Richard Jr. was the director. Achievements The grand opening exhibit of Richard Thompson Gallery was on November 19, 1977. In February 1978 Thompson was interviewed by Hugh Downs on the National Public Television program ‚ÄúOver Easy.‚Äù Thompson‚Äôs career catapulted. Paintings sales in the new gallery were brisk, and Thompson enjoyed a lifestyle that allowed him freedom to paint. In July 1979 a feature article in The Milwaukee Journal, written by art critic James Auer, gave Thompson the title of ‚ÄúWisconsin‚Äôs Monet.‚Äù He admitted he was influenced by the great Impressionist Claude Monet. Thompson also felt much more could be explored after the era of Impressionism ended. This is where he felt he was the continuing link and could further the work started by the early Impressionists. He was devoted to colors created by the sun. ‚ÄúColor is then unlimited, as the sun is ever changing,‚Äù he said. A biography titled Richard Earl Thompson, American Impressionist: A Prophetic Odyssey in Paint was published in 1982 and written by art historian Patricia Jobe Pierce. During the summer of 1990 a film crew visited his summer home in northern Wisconsin to film his life, loves, painting, and philosophy. Unfortunately, he did not live to see the film because he died from pancreatic cancer on August 6, 1991. The film is titled American Impressionist, Richard Earl Thompson from the Holiday Video Library, a division of Finley Holiday Films. Thompson produced more than 1,525 numbered paintings in his fine arts career. He had numerous reviews, and his works adorned many covers of accredited magazines such as Reader‚Äôs Digest, American Art Review, Southwest Art, Western Art Digest, Midwest Art, International Fine Art Collector, and Country Gentleman. Thompson's paintings were chosen for eight covers on The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) magazine, with comprehensive articles included for each. He was a regular on the covers of Yankee Magazine and Fortune‚Äôs Almanac. Thompson had eighteen one-man exhibits and was collected in private and corporate collections worldwide. Among them are The Lewer Agency, Kansas City, Missouri; Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Naval Art Collection, Pentagon, Washington, D.C.; R.W. Norton Art Gallery, Shreveport, Louisiana;, Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, Wausau, Wisconsin; and The Southland Corporation, Dallas, Texas. His work was exhibited in three museums ‚Äì Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, Wisconsin, the Norton Art Museum & Gallery, Shreveport, Louisiana and Charles Allis Art Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. President John F. Kennedy's tragic event in 1963, marked 50 years in 2013. Charlie Scheips, the author of the \\"Art Set\\" column of the New York Social Diary, wrote a retrospect to 1963 and the turbulent times that forever changed our country and the impact it made on the art world. Artist Richard Earl Thompson was included in his article which can be seen below in External links. His thirty years as an American Impressionist painter were his happiest. Thompson remained an avid fisherman throughout his life and enjoyed classical music and good cigars, especially while painting. He maintained homes on waterfronts throughout his lifetime. One was a summer home on Big Round Lake near Hayward, Wisconsin in the northern part of the state, and the other was a winter retreat in the Florida Keys on the Gulf of Mexico, both equipped with painting studios designed by son and architect, Dan Thompson .

In late May 2014 riots broke out in a successful attempt to stop an eviction. The building was partially demolished and rebuilt by the local community. Eviction attempt In May 2014, negotiations took place between the owners of the building, Barcelona's public transport operator Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona and the squatters. After the negotiations failed, the building was evicted on May 26 and demolition works commenced. As a result, Barcelona experienced riots and protests during the following nights. The protests also spread to the cities of Madrid, Mallorca and Valencia. The government sent an additional 200 police officers to Barcelona to help in dealing with the protests. In a successful attempt to stop the demolition, protesters built barricades and set the excavator on fire. Reconstruction The building was resquatted and a community-based reconstruction program begun. The local government announced on May 30 that the building would not be demolished. Can Vies launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund the rebuilding costs, which were estimated at ‚Ç¨70,000. In the end, ‚Ç¨90,000 was quickly raised.
