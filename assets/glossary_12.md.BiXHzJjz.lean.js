History The Apostolic Church ‚Äì Ghana is a denomination emanated from the Pentecostal Movement which started from the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival. It practices self-governing and claims to own local churches in every District in Ghana and Foreign Mission Fields with its headquarters in Accra, Ghana. The church is firmly identified as a Pentecostal, Trinitarian, Evangelical and Bible-believing church with the aim of bringing the good news of Jesus Christ as savior and Lord to all people. It is further dedicated to teaching and living with the power of the Holy Spirit. The church accept everyone irrespective of who they are and disciple them to accomplish God‚Äôs purpose for them. Welsh Revival In 1904-1905, Wales experienced an outbreak of Revival. Pentecostal groups sprung up with a clear believe in the five fold ministry (Ephesians 4:11) and the operation of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit as recorded in 1 Corinthians 12:1-11. The Apostolic doctrine became phenomenal in the young fellowship. Daniel Powell and Jones Williams were ordained apostle and a prophet in the church... The Gold Coast, modern Ghana, was no exception to the spread of Pentecostalism. Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria was thus introduced to a group of Christians at a small town in the Eastern Region of Ghana called Asamankese. The Birth of Ghanaian Pentecostalism The group led by Peter Anim Newman, then requested the Apostolic Church in Bradford, England, to send a delegation to visit them. Pastor George Perfect was sent to Asamankese in 1935. Pastor Peter Newman Anim was ordained a pastor eventually after the fellowship accepted to follow the core belief of the Apostolic Church Bradford. Pastor James and Mrs. Sophia McKeown were sent as first resident Missionary. Due to a doctrinal difference between James McKoewn and some of members of divine healing, the group split with Pastor Anim Newman leading a faction of the Church to form Christ Apostolic Church Ghana in 1938. The spread of the church The church headquarters was moved to Cape Coast in 1941 and Pastor McKeown was Superintendent Missionary. Pastors R.S. Asomaning, J.A.C.Anaman, J.A. Bimpong, D.K. Boateng, S.K. Frimpong and others supported him. Pastors Lartey Adotey, A.S. Mallet, C.K. Diaba and Elder Q.A.L. Quarshie pioneered the establishment of a branch in Accra in 1944. The Accra branch under the leadership of the late Pastor Anaman expanded so quickly that in 1984 the headquarters of the Church was moved to Accra. Pastor C. B. Sercombe,Pastor Adams Mckeown, Pastor Albert Seaborne and Pastor S. M. Hammond were all sent out by the Apostolic Church UK to strengthen the church. Others Missionaries like Pastors H. L. Copp, C.H. Rosser in 1962, F. Johnson, Pastor P.W. Cawthorne in 1971 and E. H. Williams also were later sent to assist. In 1953 some of the membership followed Pastor James McKeown to form the Gold Coast Apostolic Church, which subsequently became the Church of Pentecost in 1962. The further claims that the Divine Healers Church, The Apostolic Reformed Church and The New Covenant Apostolic were all formed out of The Apostolic Church Ghana. The church in Ghana claim to have establish one thousand five hundred local Churches in Ghana. Very instrumental in establishing mission fields in Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, La Cote D‚ÄôIvoire, and the United States of America. From 1982 through 1985 Apostle A. Ofori-Addo served as the first Ghanaian Field chairman of the church. In 1985, the Church in Ghana attained Autonomy, and Apostle A. Ofori-Addo became the first President. The Current State of The Apostolic Church - Ghana and Leaders Currently, the number of Administrative Areas has increased from 36 in 2011 to 50 in 2014, with a commensurate increment in the numbers of Districts, Ministers and members. The financial capacity has been strengthened, and new Units set up have improved the Church‚Äôs administrative acumen. Construction works on the third phase of the Apostolic Resource Conference and Retreat Centre at Frafraha in the Greater Accra region is currently on course, with intensive training programmes being held for Ministers and members alike to boost their capacity. There is a National Executive which ensures that the decisions and policies of the National Council are implemented.

The series was conceived as a non-dialogue comedy, which the series' creators and writers say, \\"captures the madcap yet charming antics of the Oddbods, who celebrate success where they find it and take failure in their stride.

He is talented in art and remembering people's birthdays, however he wishes that he can act in a more relaxed manner. * Newt (pink; voiced by Nadia Ramlee): She is addicted to candy and her friends are inspired by her pleasant interaction towards others, although she can be arrogant. She is inquisitive as she always hangs out with her friends and takes selfies. * Zee (green; voiced by Jeremy Linn) He always takes naps, even while eating.

Her active and very public promotion of Sorbian culture was seen as part of a separatist threat at a time when the German government was pursuing the objective of moving Germany away from its traditional federalism, towards a more centralised structure. Krautz died in the women's prison in Cottbus, and has become celebrated as a victim of Nazi persecution.  Life  Pauline Rehnus (in Sorbian Pawlina Renusojc) was born, the eldest of her parents' five recorded children, in Dahlitz, a village a short distance outside Cottbus on its western side. Christian Rehnus, her father was a carpenter. She attended school in nearby Kolkwitz, which at this time still meant learning in both German and Sorbian. Her father had grown up as one of fourteen children of an farm worker and here parents were not wealthy, and after leaving school she remained with her family in order to help look after her younger siblings, while taking work in a Cottbus textile factory. In 1920 she married Reinhold Krautz who also worked in textiles. The marriage opened the way for Pauline to embark on an apprenticeship in dressmaking, which she successfully concluded with a \\"Masters\\" qualification. In 1926 Pauline Krautz (in Sorbian Pawlina Krawkowa) opened a shop in Cottbus specialising in Wendish Folk costume, arts and embroidery. However, public fashion and government views were aligned during this period in regarding traditional folk costume as \\"quirky\\" at best, and the young girls for whom the dresses were designed were reluctant to wear them. Demand was correspondingly weak and she therefore diversified, starting to produce and sell dolls in folk costume. These turned out to be extremely popular with customers, both locally and across the border in Czechoslovakia. From 1932 Krautz was displaying her dolls at a succession of exhibitions in places such as Bautzen, Dresden, Hirschberg, Saarbr√ºcken, Prague and Frankfurt. In 1936 she was able to send a large consignment of her costume dolls to Berlin in connection with the Olympic Games. However, the Nazi government which had taken power in 1933 was far more determined than its predecessor to exterminate Sorbian separatism, and the authorities became progressively more active in their hostility to a small business that based its success on the celebration of Sorbian identity. The fact that the dolls were popular in Slavic countries outside Germany, and that Krautz regularly visited Czechoslovakia with two of her sisters in connections with the flourishing business, raised her profile in the eyes of the authorities. She was criticised in the local press and questioned by the local Nazi administrator, but she was disinclined to keep her head down in response to government pressure. In April 1938 Krautz was stopped in the street by a Gestapo agent. The authorities were changing the names of the villages in the area from Sorbian to German equivalents, raising indignation locally. Krautz's opinions on the matter may already have been widely known locally, and she now asked her Gestapo interlocutor how Hitler's supposed support for the people could be reconciled with changing the names of all their villages. She was arrested the next day and taken into investigative custody. Krautz spent eleven months detained in the women's prison in Cottbus, during which time her interrogators accused her of \\"unpatriotic attacks on the state and on the party\\" (\\"heimt√ºckischer Angriffe auf Staat und Partei\\") while using all possible means to browbeat her and blackmail her into confessing that she was a spy working on behalf of the Czechoslovak intelligence services. After eleven months they released her, citing lack of evidence and she returned to her parents' house to recuperate. At the time of her release she was required to surrender, in writing, all her legal rights, to set aside any claims against the state. Manufacturing more costume dolls became impossible because no business in Cottbus would sell her the necessary raw materials and in any case no business in the Spreewald region would buy from her any more. Pauline Krautz died on 16 September 1941. With her last breath she asked that the sermon at her funeral should be delivered in the Wendish (i.e. Sorbian) language, but this wish could not be met: two Gestapo agents attended her funeral. On the 120th anniversary of her birth, on 18 December 2010, a memorial tablet (Stolperstein) was unveiled to Pauline Krautz at Cottbus, outside the site of her shop in the Sandow Street (\\"Sandower Stra√üe\\"). The event was followed by a celebration of her life at the city hall.

He is also the author of several books on I Ching and Feng Shui and a painter. Life Chang Yi-Jui was born on 2 February 1944 in Zhongliao Township, Nantou County, Taiwan. For the first thirty-eight years of his life, he was not particularly interested in religion, although he developed an early interest in the traditional Chinese I Ching and Feng Shui. In 1963, he graduated at the Land Survey Department of Kuang-Hwa Senior Industrial Vocational High School in Taichung City, Taiwan. He remained in the School as a teacher of Engineering Measurement. He was also the founder of Zhong Xin Measuring Ltd., known as the first company of land surveying in Taiwan. His business career came to an unexpected halt in 1982, when Chang fell seriously ill. He attributed his seemingly miraculous recovery to a divine intervention, and decided from then on to consecrate his life to religion. He claimed to have received revelations from Guiguzi, a name indicating a book of military strategy written between the late Warring States period and the end of the Han Dynasty and by extension its real or mythological author, later deified in Chinese folk religion. Chang then went to a pilgrimage to Mount Dawu, in Taitung County, Taiwan, accompanied by some friends. On the mountain, he claimed to have received a new revelation. He reported that the Jade Emperor, a popular character in Chinese folk religion, admonished him ‚Äúnever to be selfish‚Äù and to ‚Äúencourage people for self-cultivation. In 1983, Chang started putting his vow to devote his life to religion into practice. He opened a family hall called Yi Yao She in Taichung City, where he started teaching I Ching and offering divination services to the followers he had gathered. One year later, Yi Yao She was renamed Shennong Temple and Chang claimed to have received the Buddhist name and title ‚ÄúGrand Master Hun Yuan‚Äù by divine revelation. He claimed to be mystically united with the Bodhisattva Wang Chan Lao Zu, who had once incarnated on Earth as Guiguzi, and to receive regular revelations from him. In 1987, the Martial law in Taiwan was lifted, and Grand Master Hun Yuan was allowed to expand its activities and eventually to legally register a movement known as Weixin Shengjiao, or Weixinism, literally ‚ÄúSacred Teachings of the Heart (or Mind) Only.‚Äù The movement opened its new and larger headquarters in 1987 in Nantou County, where the Hsien Fo Temple was inaugurated. Eventually, it was followed by 42 branch temples, where religious rituals are performed and courses of I Ching and Feng Shui are offered on a regular basis. In 1993, Hun Yuan hold what he called the 99 Days Chanting Ceremony and taught his first research classes on I Ching and Feng Shui. The book Feng Shui World View, published in 1995, made Hun Yuan known to a larger public in Taiwan. In the same year, the convention ‚ÄúPropagating the Dharma of Feng Shui for the Home‚Äù at Linkou Stadium, Taipei, drew a crowd of 36,000. Weixinism Hun Yuan is primarily known as the founder and leader of Weixinism or Weixin Shengjiao, a Taiwanese new religion with a presence among the Chinese diaspora in other countries and with some Western followers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Spain; its global membership is \\"about 300,000, with a larger audience estimated by Taiwan's Ministry of Internal Affairs at 1,000,000\\". Weixin Shengjiao has been described as an institutionalization of traditional Chinese folk religion, centered on the worship of Guiguzi and of the Three Chinese Ancestors, the Yellow Emperor, Yandi and Chiyou, and on the divulgation of I Ching and Feng Shui as systems of practical and not only philosophical wisdom. The canon of Weixin Shengjiao includes scriptures of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, as well as the large corpus of revelations Hun Yuan claims to receive from Guiguzi, collected in the sixteen volumes of the Apocalypse Sutra. All the speeches and writings, and in fact all the daily utterances, of Hun Yuan, are collected in the Weixin Dao Zang, which, by 2017, had reached the extraordinary size of more than 18,000 volumes. In addition, Hun Yuan is the author of several volumes popularizing I Ching and Feng Shui. One, collecting his Yang House Feng Shui Lectures, was translated into English in 2016 with the title Gui Gu Zi Heart Dharma in Taiwan: Yang House Feng Shui Lectures. Education Facilities In 1996, Hun Yuan founded a continuing education facility known as I Ching University, while the parallel institution Weixin College served as an academic facility for the study of I Ching and Feng Shui and was accredited as a university by the Ministry of Education (Taiwan) in 2013.Ministry of Education (Taiwan) (2013). Issue no.:Ëá∫ÊïôÈ´ò(‰∏â)Â≠óÁ¨¨1020165539Ëôü. 6 November 2013. In 2015, I Ching University stated that, from its foundation, it had completed twenty-three year-long courses, and the number of its students had exceeded sixty thousand. In 2016, I Ching University started acknowledging ‚Äúpingxin virtuous fellows,‚Äù i.e. students who had studied there for 24 years. Television programs In 1997, Hun Yuan started what would become a long career as teacher of I Ching and Feng Shui via television. He became a familiar face for Taiwanese TV viewers, and in 1998 presented his ideas overseas through his first international tour. Humanitarian Activities In 1996, Hun Yuan founded the ‚ÄúPure Land in This World Chinese Merit Foundation.‚Äù Its original aim was to propagate I Ching and Feng Shui. In 1999, however, the devastating 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake struck Taiwan. Hun Yuan mobilized the members of the Foundation and sent them to the afflicted areas. They taught how to rebuild anti-seismic public buildings and homes by using the principles of Feng Shui, but also provided help to affected families. The movement reported that the number of Taiwanese families that received help from the Foundation exceeded three thousand. In 2012, the name of the Foundation was changed to ‚ÄúWeixin Shengjiao Merit Foundation.‚Äù According to the movement, the current number of members is around sixty thousand. Relations between Taiwan and China In 2001, with the stated aim of improving the relationships between Taiwan and China, Hun Yuan organized in Taipei what became the first of a series of annual conferences on Guiguzi, featuring scholars from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and reached an agreement with the authorities of the Chinese province of Henan to build there a Town of Chinese Culture, or City of Eight Trigrams (a name derived from the I Ching), featuring several temples. In 2003, Hun Yuan established the Gui Gu Zi Academic and Research Association, whose stated aim is to trace the origins and foundations of Chinese culture. In particular, the Association compiled a list of 15,615 Chinese family clan names, 917 names of emperors who ruled in China,and 3,762 wars which plagued Chinese history. For Hun Yuan, collecting these names does not serve a purely scholarly purpose but also a religious one. In 2004, he organized in the Linkou Stadium, Taipei, the first ‚ÄúUnified Ancestor Worship Ceremony for Chinese in the 21st Century,‚Äù honoring all the ancestors of the Chinese peoples, particularly those who had died in different wars. Crowds in excess of 30,000 attend these ceremonies held each year on January 1; presidents of the republic of Taiwan and other senior political leaders have also participated in the events. In 2012, Wu Ching-ji, then Taiwan's Minister of the Education, announced during a conference on Feng Shui that Hun Yuan had been nominated as a candidate for the 2013 Nobel Peace PrizeSee video at http://hunyuan.tw/?disp=wisdom&m;=1&s;=23&n;=68&p;=9739. Wu‚Äôs announcement is from minutes 6'18\\" to 7'05‚Äù. (which was finally awarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons). Artistic Production Hun Yuan, The Stable Nation of the Golden Dragon Hun Yuan is also a prolific painter. Although rooted in the tradition of Chinese calligraphy and ink wash painting, his large works, often depicting dragons, are realized in a distinctive style. He often demonstrates publicly how they are produced in a few seconds with a single brush stroke applying black ink to Xuan paper. All branch temples of Weixin Shengjiao store paintings by Hun Yuan, but the largest collection is now at Weixin Museum, a museum that is part of Weixin Shengjiao's headquarters in Nantou County. Critics, and the movement itself, regard as most significant the 108 pieces of dragon-shaped ruyi (\\"auspicious,\\" literally ‚Äúeverything goes as one wishes‚Äù) calligraphy, including the frequently reproduced The Stable Nation of the Golden Dragon. Hun Yuan has also produced designs for building and gardens. The movement reported that the landscape design of the Hsien Fo Temple was based on a project by Hun Yuan, who insisted that the layout of the buildings should correspond with the shape of the nearby mountains to create a feeling of harmonious unity, based on both Feng Shui and Zen.See ‚ÄúÁ¶™Ê©üÂ±±‰ªô‰ΩõÂØ∫ÂÖ®ÁêÉË≥áË®äÁ∂≤ (The official website of Chan Chi Shan Hsien Fo Temple).‚Äù According to the movement, Hun Yuan also supplied designs for the two Eight Trigrams Holy Cities that Weixin Shengjiao is building in Henan, China and in Nantou County, Taiwan.

Vault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, that detail activities and capabilities of the United States' Central Intelligence Agency to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dated from 2013‚Äì2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A CIA internal audit identified 91 malware tools out of more than 500 tools in use in 2016 being compromised by the release.  History  In February 2017, WikiLeaks began teasing the release of \\"Vault 7\\" with a series of cryptic messages on Twitter, according to media reports. Later on in February, WikiLeaks released classified documents describing how the CIA monitored the 2012 French presidential election. The press release for the leak stated that it was published \\"as context for its forthcoming CIA Vault 7 series.\\" In March 2017, US intelligence and law enforcement officials said to the international wire agency Reuters that they have been aware of the CIA security breach, which led to Vault 7, since late-2016. Two officials said they were focusing on \\"contractors\\" as the possible source of the leaks.Reuters: U.S intel, law enforcement officials aware of CIA breach since late last year, 8 March 2017 In 2017, federal law enforcement identified CIA software engineer Joshua Adam Schulte as a suspected source of Vault 7.  Publications  = Part 1 - \\"Year Zero\\"= The first batch of documents named \\"Year Zero\\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which already contains more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release. WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \\"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \\"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\\" since these tools raise questions that \\"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\\" WikiLeaks redacted names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, while attempting to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \\"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series. The CIA released a statement saying, \\"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\\" In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed to, disagreed with, or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw.Chris Evans, Ben Hawkes: Feedback and data-driven updates to Google‚Äôs disclosure policy, Google's Project Zero blog, 13 February 2015 According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \\"Google and some other companies\\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \\"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\\".Sam Varghese: Vault 7: Plans to expose firms that do not patch flaws, iTWire, 20 March 2017Assange chastises companies that haven't responded to CIA vulnerability offers, The Hill, 20 March 2017 = Part 2 - \\"Dark Matter\\"= On 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 2 \\"Dark Matter\\". The publication included documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs. = Part 3 - \\"Marble\\"= On 31 March 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 3 \\"Marble\\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti- virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects. = Part 4 - \\"Grasshopper\\"= On 7 April 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 4 dubbed \\"Grasshopper\\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS. = Part 5 - \\"HIVE\\"= On 14 April 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 5, titled \\"HIVE\\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \\"Embedded Development Branch\\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains through a masking interface known as \\"Switchblade\\". Also called Listening Post (LP) and Command and Control (C2). = Part 6 - \\"Weeping Angel\\"= On 21 April 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 6, code-named \\"Weeping Angel\\", a hacking tool co- developed by the CIA and MI5 used to exploit a series of smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware and coordinated their work in Joint Development Workshops. As of this part 6 publication, \\"Weeping Angel\\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside \\"Sonic Screwdriver\\" in \\"Dark Matter\\". = Part 7 - \\"Scribbles\\"= On 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 7 \\"Scribbles\\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \\"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work!) [and d]ocuments that are not [locked], encrypted, or password-protected\\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is overridden only when a user enables editing. = Part 8 - \\"Archimedes\\"= On 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 8 \\"Archimedes\\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \\"Fulcrum\\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA. = Part 9 - \\"AfterMidnight\\" and \\"Assassin\\"= On 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 9 \\"AfterMidnight\\" and \\"Assassin\\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time. = Part 10 - \\"Athena\\"= On 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 10 \\"Athena\\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \\"Athena\\" malware and its secondary malware named \\"Hera\\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Also both Athena and Hera affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks has not provided any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not. = Part 11 - \\"Pandemic\\"= On 1 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 11 \\"Pandemic\\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \\"Pandemic\\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \\"Pandemic\\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \\"Pandemic\\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network. = Part 12 - \\"Cherry Blossom\\"= On 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 12 \\"Cherry Blossom\\". = Part 13 - \\"Brutal Kangaroo\\"= On 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 13 \\"Brutal Kangaroo\\". = Part 14 - \\"Elsa\\"= On 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 14 \\"Elsa\\". = Part 15 - \\"OutlawCountry\\"= On 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 15 \\"OutlawCountry\\". = Part 16 - \\"BothanSpy\\"= On 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 16 \\"BothanSpy\\". = Part 17 - \\"Highrise\\"= On 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 17 \\"Highrise\\". = Part 18 - \\"UCL / Raytheon\\"= UCL / Raytheon - 19 July 2017 = Part 19 - \\"Imperial\\"= Imperial - 27 July 2017 = Part 20 - \\"Dumbo\\"= Dumbo - 3 August 2017 = Part 21 - \\"CouchPotato\\"= CouchPotato - 10 August 2017 = Part 22 - \\"ExpressLane\\"= WikiLeaks publishes secret documents from the \\"ExpressLane\\" project of the CIA. These documents show one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against liaison services‚Äîwhich includes among many others the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The OTS (Office of Technical Services), a branch within the CIA, has a biometric collection system that is provided to liaison services around the world‚Äîwith the expectation for sharing of the biometric takes collected on the systems. But this 'voluntary sharing' obviously does not work or is considered insufficient by the CIA, because ExpressLane is a covert information collection tool that is used by the CIA to secretly exfiltrate data collections from such systems provided to liaison services. ExpressLane is installed and run with the cover of upgrading the biometric software by OTS agents that visit the liaison sites. Liaison officers overseeing this procedure will remain unsuspicious, as the data exfiltration disguises behind a Windows installation splash screen. The core components of the OTS system are based on products from Cross Match, a US company specializing in biometric software for law enforcement and the Intelligence Community. The company hit the headlines in 2011 when it was reported that the US military used a Cross Match product to identify Osama bin Laden during the assassination operation in Pakistan.- 24 August 2017 = Part 23 - \\"Angelfire\\"= Angelfire - 31 August 2017 = Part 24 - \\"Protego\\"= Protego - 7 September 2017  Authenticity  When asked about their authenticity, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Hayden replied that the organization does \\"not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.\\" However, speaking on condition of anonymity, current and former intelligence officials said that the documents appear to be genuine. Edward Snowden tweeted shortly after the documents' release that they looked authentic. Robert M. Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas and Director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), likened the Vault 7 to NSA hacking tools disclosed in 2016 by a group calling itself The Shadow Brokers. On 15 March 2017, President Donald Trump stated during an interview that \\"the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken\\". The following day in a statement, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a news release, \\"In his effort to once again blame Obama, the President appeared to have discussed something that, if true and accurate, would otherwise be considered classified information.\\" Schiff also said that the president has the power to declassify whatever he wants.  Organization of cyber warfare  WikiLeaks said that the documents came from \\"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products. The cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \\"Longhorn,\\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \\"Longhorn\\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries. =Frankfurt base= The first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \\"Year Zero\\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany. The chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \\"Year Zero\\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.German Foreign Minister Gabriel fears new arms race with Russia, Deutsche Welle, 9 March 2017  UMBRAGE  The documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \\"Umbrage Component Library\\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to PC World, some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. PC World commented that the practice of planting \\"false flags\\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags. According to a study by Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \\"extremely public\\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \\"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\\" =False flag theories= On the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \\"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\\" and tweeted, \\"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \\"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\\" Cybersecurity writers, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen wrote, \\"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\\"  Marble framework  The documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. As part of the program, foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks.Jacques Cheminat: Marble Framework: le double jeu perfide des hackers de la CIA, silicon.fr, 31 March 2017Stefania Maurizi: WikiLeaks, cos√¨ la Cia depista i raid nei computer: svelato il 'Marble Framework', La Repubblica, 31 March 2017Jean-Marc Manach: WikiLeaks joue √† cache-cache avec la CIA, Lib√©ration, 31 March 2017 According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016. In its release, WikiLeaks described the primary purpose of \\"Marble\\" as to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation.Sam Varghese: WikiLeaks releases third tranche of CIA files, iTWire', 1 April 2017 The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian. These were the languages of the US's main cyber-adversaries ‚Äì China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.John Leyden: WikiLeaks exposes CIA anti-forensics tool that makes Uncle Sam seem fluent in enemy tongues, The Register, 31 March 2017 Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling The Hill its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs. Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation. Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \\"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\\"The Washington Post: WikiLeaks‚Äô latest release of CIA cyber-tools could blow the cover on agency hacking operations, The Washington Post, 31 March 2017Wikileaks releases code that could unmask CIA hacking operations, Ars Technica, 2 April 2017  Compromised technology and software  = CDs/DVDs = HammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that Trojans 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero.

The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc. = Apple products = After WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \\"Year Zero\\", Apple stated that \\"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\\" and that the company will \\"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\\" On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \\"Dark Matter\\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing on Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware, meaning that the attack code would persist even if the device was rebooted.Releases Dark Matter, WikiLeaks, 23 March 2017WikiLeaks CIA files: New 'Dark Matter' release details how US 'hacked into Apple products', The Independent, 23 March 2017 The \\"Dark Matter\\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring that based on an \\"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \\"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\\". = Cisco = WikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \\"CIA was secretly exploiting\\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents.https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/843573087950069764http://www.securityweek.com/cisco- finds-zero-day-vulnerability-vault-7-leak The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.Joseph Menn: A scramble at Cisco exposes uncomfortable truths about U.S. cyber defense, Reuters, 29. March 2017 On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network. Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice. = Smartphones/tablets = The electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.  Messaging services  According to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \\"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets. = Vehicle control systems = One document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \\"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings. = Windows = The documents refer to a \\"Windows FAX DLL injection\\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.  Commentary  On 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden commented on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \\"developing vulnerabilities in US products\\" and \\"then intentionally keeping the holes open\\", which he considers highly reckless. On 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes: On 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to Forbes, wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts. On 8 March 2017, Some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden. On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney called it \\"critical\\" to understand that \\"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \\"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\\". On 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \\"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\\" \\"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \\"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\\" \\"The freedom to have a private conversation ‚Äì free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening ‚Äì is central to a free society\\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth Amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.Olivia Solon: With the latest WikiLeaks revelations about the CIA ‚Äì is privacy really dead?, The Guardian, 8 March 2017 On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote \\"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, while they failed to inform Microsoft in a timely fashion about their security breach, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period and caused widespread damage.

It is located in the center of Unjha, Mehsana district, Gujarat, India, where thousands of visitors visit every day. It is about 2100 years old but it was rebuilt around a century ago with the aid of the people living there.  Umiya Maa Temples in United States  They are spreading their faith abroad as well. Patidars who are settled in the United States came together and build their Kuldevi a temple. The first Umiya Mata temple that was built in the United States was in Macon, a city in the southeastern American state of Georgia. Currently, two new temples are being built in New Jersey and Boston. All of these temples were built from the donation made by the Patidars. Since Umiya Maa is kuldevi of the Patel community, building more temples will strengthen the relationship between the Patel community. The Patidar brings Umiya maa chariot from Gujarat, state in India so everyone in abroad can have a chance to take the blessings and it gives all the members of Patel Community to connect socially.  Festival Celebrations  Umiya Mataji Sanstha Chicago Midwest (UMSCM) celebrates Holi festival in Joliet. More than 500 people joins to celebrate Holi every year. This festival signifies the victory of good over evil. This festival celebration is split into two events ‚Äì Holika Dahan and color Holi. In Holika Dahan, wood and cow dungs are burned in a symbolic pyre to signify good defeating evil. The next morning, people gather in open space at the temple to take part in Rangwali Holi, where people put colored powders (gulal) and colored water, on each other in celebration of spring. At the temple in Chicago, snacks and dinner are served in the free event as children and families participate in this event. In addition, the devotees also pray, dance, and sing devotional songs.  Influence on Politics  As the election comes near, the politicians start campaigning. In India, politicians target the individual's belief and religion. The politicians go to Umiya Maa Temple to start campaigning to show the citizens of India how much they care about their religion. Politicians also try to woo religious leaders to gain the support of their millions of followers. In Gujarat, Umiya Maa Temple is used to gain votes and trust of Patels. In order to get votes from the Patel community, the politicians need blessing from this Temple. For instance, two years ago, congress vice president Rahul Gandhi visited the Umiya Mata temple in Unjha town of Mehsana district and offered prayers ahead of his rally. He went to temple first and performed aarti at Umiya temple in Unjha. Gandhi's visit to Umiya Mata temple at Unjha, holds significance in the wake of the tension by Patel community for reservation under Other Backward Class (OBC) category.  Umiya Dham Ahmedabad Kadva Patidar community, the major contributor of Umiya Temple in Unjha, also developed Umiya Dham. Umiya Dham is going to be located in Ahmadabad. It is likely to be inaugurated on January 30 or during the first week of February. This project nearly costs Rs 1,000 crore. There is going to be stone laying ceremony where millions devotees are going to attend. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to lay the foundation of the Umiya Dham. Along with Ma Umiya Temple, the project will have a Non- resident of India (NRI) guest house, a convention hall, boys/girls hostel, senior citizen care facilities, medical facilities, recreational/sports facilities, and career development facilities.

Early life Born into a Catholic family at Bellamour, near Rugeley, Staffordshire, he was the second son of Edward Blount (1769‚Äì1843) and his wife, Frances (died 1859), daughter of Francis Wright of Fitzwalters, Essex. He had four brothers, none of whom married, the eldest being Walter Blount the herald. He was sent young to Rugeley Grammar School, where the local Anglican vicar was master, which at home he studied French with Father Malvoisin, an √©migr√© Catholic priest. In 1819, he went to St Mary's College, Oscott, and stayed until 1827. After a short time in the London office of the Provincial Bank of Ireland, he moved to the home office. Through his father he moved as a young man in Whig society, and sometimes attended breakfast parties at Holland House. In the autumn of 1829, Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville, British ambassador in Paris, appointed him attach√© to the embassy; next year he was transferred to the consulate at Rome. At Rome he met Cardinal Weld and Cardinal Wiseman; and at the palace of Queen Hortense he first met her son, the future Napoleon III. In 1831 he left Rome to join the Paris banking firm of Callaghan & Co. With his father's help, he soon started the bank of Edward Blount, P√®re et Fils, at No. 7 Rue Laffitte. The business proved successful, and he afterwards joined Charles Laffitte, nephew of Jacques Laffitte, in forming Charles Laffitte, Blount & Co., Rue Basse du Rempart. Financing French railways Blount concentrated on the promotion of railway enterprises in France, where in 1836 there was just one short line, between Strassburg and B√¢le. In 1838 a French government bill for the construction of seven major trunk-lines under the control of the state was defeated, and the way thrown open to private enterprise. Blount offered Jules Armand Dufaure, then minister of public works, to construct a jointly-financed line from Paris to Rouen; the proposal was accepted, and a company, the Chemin de fer de l'Ouest, was formed by Blount, who became chairman. Backers included James Rothschild and Lord Overstone, and the directors were half French and half English. The law authorising Blount's firm to construct the railway from Paris was signed by King Louis Philippe on 15 July 1840, and the line, designed by Joseph Locke with Thomas Brassey as contractor, was opened on 9 May 1843. William Barber Buddicom, the locomotive manager of the London and North Western Railway at Liverpool, brought 50 English drivers to France, Blount himself learned engine-driving, and the line prospered from the first. Blount remained chairman for thirty years. With his partner, Laffitte, Blount next constructed in 1845 the line from Amiens to Boulogne by way of Abbeville and Neufch√¢tel- Hardelot. Subsequently (1852‚Äì53) he was administrator of the lines from Lyon to Avignon, and between Lyon, M√¢con and Geneva. He invested also in other European railways and projects. Third bank Blount helped Louis Philippe's family escape the French Revolution of 1848. His bank failed, and while the creditors were eventually paid in full, he had to retire to St. Germains and retrench. With the aid of Brassey and other wealthy friends he started in the autumn of 1852 a third banking business, Edward Blount & Company at No. 7 Rue de la Paix. The venture prospered. Blount acted as banker to the Papal government. After the unification of Italy of 1859, and the annexation of the Papal States to the new kingdom, he took on the transfer of the financial liabilities of the Papal States to the new Italian government, and the conversion of the papal debt. On the outbreak of revolution in Paris on 4 September 1870, and the foundation of the French Third Republic, Blount wound up the affairs of his bank and transferred the business to the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of Paris, of which he became president. The siege of Paris When the Prussian forces threatened Paris, Blount sent his wife and family to England, but remained with his son Aston through the siege of Paris. Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons the British ambassador, left for Tours on 17 November and Blount took charge of British interests, being formally appointed British consul on 24 January 1871. During the siege he with Richard Wallace and Alan Herbert distributed relief aid from United Kingdom. Blount dined with Otto von Bismarck at Versailles after the fall of the city, and left for London at the end of March 1871. Convinced that the British should have come to the rescue of France, he spoke his mind to W. E. Gladstone, the prime minister. Later life For his services, Blount was made CB on 13 March 1871, becoming KCB (civil) on 2 June 1878. He was also a commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur. In 1894 Blount resigned the chairmanship of the Chemin de fer de l'Ouest, at a time of xenophobia; his fellow directors elected him honorary president. He maintained a position in English and French society in Paris, and was for many years president of the British chamber of commerce there. His financial interests extended beyond France. He was a director among other ventures of the General Credit and Finance Company (afterwards the Union Discount Company of London) and of the London Joint Stock Bank. Devoted to horse racing, Blount followed the stable of the Comte de Lagrange, and was a member of the French Jockey Club. The Comte died in 1883, and he then kept a small stable of his own. In June 1901 Blount retired from the presidency of his banking concern, the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of Paris; leaving France, he was made honorary president. He then settled at his Sussex home, Imberhorne, East Grinstead. He died at East Grinstead on 15 March 1905, aged 96, and was buried in the family vault at the cemetery of St. Francis, Crawley, Sussex. He built a Catholic school near Birmingham, and a church at East Grinstead. Works Blount dictated his memoirs to a neighbour, Stuart J. Reid, who published them in 1902. Blount was a surrealist amateur photomontagist. He created an album with hundreds of photo-montages which might be very revealing to a psychoanalyst. Family On 18 November 1834, Blount married Gertrude Frances, third daughter of William Charles Jerningham. She died on 9 November 1907. Of their two sons and three daughters, he was survived only by his younger son, Henry Edmund Blount.

Hollingsworth was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but moved to Greenville, South Carolina, as a small child. During the last decade of the 19th century, Hollingsworth's grandfather, Pinckney Carson Hollingsworth, traveled between textile mills repairing carding machines, a business inherited by Hollingsworth's father, John D. Hollingsworth Sr. (1878-1942), and one in which Hollingsworth Jr. participated from an early age. Hollingsworth graduated from Greenville High School and spent one lackluster year as a student at Furman University. But following his father's death in 1942, he and his mother inherited the business.Irvine T. Welling Jr., \\"John D. Hollingsworth Jr. and My Experiences Working with Him,\\" Proceedings and Papers of the Greenville County Historical Society, 2006-2014, 13 (2015), 23-33. In January 1944, Hollingsworth received his first patent for \\"an invention that allowed textile machinery to better process synthetic fibers.\\" Shortly thereafter he was both drafted into the U.S. Navy and married his bookkeeper, Ella Mae Bennett, who managed the business in his absence. In the 1950s, Hollingsworth perfected metallic card clothing, revolutionizing the textile carding process. He also purchased and rebuilt used cards for sale.Welling, 24. Ella Hollingsworth played a significant role in managing her husband's business for more than fifteen years. Mary Jane Hollingsworth Crolley, Machinations (Simpsonville, SC: privately published, 1988). Though Hollingsworth products and his reputation for excellent service soon made him a wealthy, internationally significant manufacturer of textile machinery, he could be a slapdash businessman. In 1964, a newly hired accountant was horrified to discover that although Hollingsworth's company had annual sales of about $9 million, the business was not incorporated and Hollingsworth had kept no accounting books.Welling, 25. \\"There were stacks of cancelled checks wrapped with different colored ribbon to signify the type of expenses.\\" Hollingsworth was also overly enamored of innovative textile machinery and made many uneconomical purchases.Welling, 26. Nevertheless, Hollingsworth used his wealth to invest in land, spending forty years amassing 42,000 acres.Hollingsworth Funds website. \\"\\"Whenever he purchased additional property, he would immediately plant pine trees if the property was not already wooded. In addition to his love of the trees, it qualified the property for agricultural use at lower property tax rates.\\" Welling, 26.

Hollingsworth regularly kept large amounts of cash in his office. For many years thereafter, Hollingsworth lived in eccentric simplicity, making his home in an Airstream trailer behind his plant and driving a Volkswagen Rabbit. Yet he was generous to his employees and kept a warehouse full of boxed toys.Welling, 31. Hollingsworth also collected old coins and guns, antique cars, and pewter plates.

Inflamed tissue  Inflamed tissue has a lower pH value (~5‚Äì7) than non-inflamed tissue (7.4). Through computer simulation, scientists found a way to make the fentanyl analog only affect inflamed tissue via the addition of fluorine to the chemical structure.

As a result, NFEPP has the potential to reduce opioid addiction and dependency, as there is no effect on users who are not actually suffering from pain, as the chemical does not interact with non-inflamed brain tissue.

Bito came out of retirement and returned to Stardom in April 2016, and returned to the ring in June of that year, before retiring again in December 2017.  Professional wrestling career  =World Wonder Ring Stardom (2010-2012)= Bito entered Stardom's professional wrestling dojo in 2010 with a background in karate and handball.

In November, Bito teamed with Yuzuki Aikawa, her main rival, to take part in the tournament to crown the first ever winners of the Goddess of Stardom Championship. In the final, Bito and Aikawa defeated Yoshiko and Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo to become the inaugural champions. Bito and Aikawa held on to the championships throughout the rest of 2011 and into 2012. In August 2012, Bito challenged Aikawa for the Wonder of Stardom Championship, where she was unsuccessful. This would turn out to be Bito's last match before announcing her retirement in November of that year, citing neck and back injuries as her reason and subsequently vacating the Goddess of Stardom Championship. = Return to Stardom (2016-2017) = After a near four-year absence from professional wrestling, Bito announced her return to the ring in April 2016, and made her official in-ring return on June 16 at Korakuen Hall, losing to Kairi Hojo.

Subsequent litigation established that the institution had always been in full capital compliance, a fact to which the FDIC stipulated in 2011, after 21 years of legal challenges by Franklin's shareholders. Also, the FDIC refused to open its books to a bankruptcy judge and never demonstrated that the seizure resulted in a loss to the American taxpayers. It is widely believed that Franklin's assets, which had a book value of more than $380 million when seized, were ultimately sold by the government to private investors at a significant profit. Franklin Savings was founded in 1889. In 1972, Ernest Fleischer, became its largest shareholder. In 1981, a new business plan was developed for the thrift with the help of economics professor Wayne Angell who would go on to become a Federal Reserve Board governor, and its assets grew from $200 million to $11 billion. The thrift bought a large amount of mortgage-backed securities and had dealings in financial futures and interest rate swaps as part of a sophisticated risk hedging program that would come to be regarded in following years as state of the art. Franklin pioneered the practice of putting its portfolio through stress tests long before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 would require such a practice of the nation's largest banks. They had various complex securities that included deep discounted securities, long call and put options and strips (both interest only and principal only) all of which were used for interest rate and prepayment risk hedging practices, not for speculation. They had also purchased junk bonds. The thrift had few traditional home mortgage loans on its books. The thrift's liabilities consisted primarily of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and repurchase agreements. In addition, over 70% of its deposits were obtained through brokers or telephone marketing programs, a method for raising deposits which U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Board President, found at trial to be less expensive and more reliable than traditional deposits, despite Office of Thrift Supervision regulators' unsupported claims to the contrary.742 F. Supp. 1089 (1990) FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION and Franklin Savings Corporation, Plaintiffs, v. DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION, Defendant. Civ. A. No. 90-4054-S. United States District Court, D. Kansas. September 5, 1990 The thrift also bought the stock brokerage firms of L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., Stern Brothers & Company, and Underwood, Neuhaus & Company. Franklin Savings was seized by the government in February 1990. At the time it had assets of $9.3 billion and deposits of $4.6 billion. Franklin filed a lawsuit disputing the seizure, and Judge Saffels in Topeka, Kansas ruled that the seizure was illegal. He found there was no basis in fact or law for the seizure, that it was arbitrary and capricious, and that, \\"there has been no allegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct by Franklin's management or directors. Essentially, this case boils down to a dispute over accounting practices.\\" (Entire ruling attached.) Judge Saffels found that Franklin was in full capital compliance with a regulatory GAAP net worth of $388,519,213 and an economic value of no less than that. However, the government appealed and the lower court's decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Limiting its scope of review to the record presented by the OTS to justify the seizure, the court concluded that: \\"A review of the administrative file clearly reveals a high-flying, debt-laden, troubled savings and loan. The record reveals the owners diverting millions of dollars into their pockets through large salaries, bonuses and dividends, notwithstanding the losses being incurred by the association. The record reveals a financial institution taking what the director deemed to be unacceptable risks with its depositors' monies. In fact, the record reveals a financial institution both unable and unwilling to comply with the director's requirements relating to safety and soundness concerns.\\" The court arrived at this conclusion after determining that a court's role under FIRREA is limited to determining whether the statutory grounds existed for a seizure. The 10th Circuit concluded that, under FIRREA, the statutory grounds exist if in the Director's \\"opinion\\" they exist. The court went on to apply a dictionary definition of opinion: \\"a belief held with confidence, not substantiated by direct proof or knowledge.\\" The appeal became settled precedent for the post-seizure scope of judicial review for federally insured banks and thrifts after the United States Supreme Court declined to review the case.Court Takes Home-Office Tax Case March 24, New York Times 1992 In addition to losing on appeal before the 10th Circuit, Franklin's shareholders were denied hearings as a matter of law for their claims to recover the value of their holdings on either Takings (Claims Court and Federal Circuit) or Tort (District and 10th Circuit), a fact which raises questions to this day about the lack of due process in Franklin's case. At one point, in an effort to put an end to the shareholders' legal challenges, the RTC/FDIC brought claims for over $200 million against FSA shareholders, directors and officers. But, following a jury trial, the government lost on all 19 separate claims that the Federal District Court Judge had not dismissed as a matter of law. The FDIC, from FSA assets, then paid the defendants $3.5 million to reimburse them for their counsel fees and expenses. In 1993, Federal Bankruptcy Judge John Flannagan ruled (Finding of Fact Number 80 in the Bankruptcy Court's opinion in In re Franklin Savings Corp., 159 B.R. 9, 25 (Bankr.D.Kan. 1993): ‚ÄúAs of January 1, 1990, FSA capital, according to generally accepted accounting principles, was $388,519,213.‚Äù He also noted: \\"FSC has urged the Court to accept the factual findings Judge Saffels made in Franklin Sav. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 742 F.Supp. 1089 (D.Kan.1990), as legally binding factual findings in this case. This Court finds it unnecessary to address that request since it has made its own independent findings of fact based on the evidence presented on the record made here.\\" In 2004, Federal Bankruptcy Court Judge John Lungstrum, in his opinion granting summary judgment in favor of FSC on its objection to the OTS claim in FSC v. OTC, 303 B.R. 488 (D.Kan. 2004), concluded: ‚ÄúIt is undisputed that a capital deficiency did not exist.‚Äù Ultimately, in December 2011 bankruptcy court proceedings, the FDIC agreed that in seizing Franklin the OTS had taken over a solvent and fully capital compliant institution (Stipulation Dkt. #1628 filed 12/21/2011, ¬∂ 4, p. 2 [At the time of the appointment of the Conservator, FSA had a GAAP net worth of $388,519213.]).

The initiative was placed on the ballot by UNITE HERE Local 8, a union that represents workers in the hospitality industry. Supporters of the measure see it as bringing a measure of justice to exploited workers. Opponents say the new law is unfair to guests, too expensive to implement, and unfairly advantages unions. Legislative history Initiative Measure 124 was sponsored by UNITE HERE Local 8. Stefan Moritz, a union official, filed the initial text of the initiative with Seattle's city clerk on April 5, 2016. The union began collecting signatures to get the measure on the November ballot in May 2016. The final text of the initiative was filed on May 6. The union submitted its petition signatures on June 22 and King County Elections issued a Letter of Sufficiency on July 15. The final text of the ballot title was issued on July 28. The measure passed on November 8, 2016 and became a city ordinance with full effect on November 30 after a proclamation by Mayor Ed Murray. Provisions The initiative requires hotels with 60 or more rooms to issue \\"panic buttons\\" to employees that work alone in guest rooms. Hotels are required to keep lists of guests accused of assault or harassment for five years from the date of the last accusation involving any given guest. All relevant documents must be retained for the same period. Any guest accused of assault, sexual assault, or sexual harassment must be banned from the hotel for a minimum of three years. A mere accusation is sufficient to require a ban. No investigation is required. There is no provision for appeals. Workers must be given paid time to make a police report and be given the option to work in a different area of the hotel. Police may only be contacted with the permission of the worker. Hotels are required to warn guests about these rules with a placard written in a large font placed on the interior side of their room doors. Under the initiative, when a hotel is sold the new owners are required to offer employees of the previous owner work before hiring replacement staff. This requirement applies from the day of sale until six months after the hotel is open to the public while under the management of the new employer. If during the first 90 days of operations the new owner finds that it needs fewer workers, staff must be retained by order of seniority. During this 90 day period staff may not be otherwise dismissed except for cause. Workers must be provided with a written performance evaluation at the end of this period; these records must be retained for at least three years. Conspicuous public notice of change of ownership, including contact information for the new owners, must be posted within five days after a sale is agreed to and must remain posted for six months after the hotel has been open to the public under new management. This provision applies to hotels with 60 rooms or more. The initiative requires large hotels to limit the workload of cleaning staff to 5,000 square feet per eight-hour shift and regulates the handling of cleaning chemicals. Cleaners assigned space over this limit would be paid at time-and-a-half wage. This provision applies to hotels with 100 rooms or more. The initiative requires large hotels that don't offer health benefits to pay staff a monthly stipend to help them buy insurance. Qualifying workers would receive an amount based on their income, family size, the federal poverty line, and the lowest premium offered on the Washington Health Benefits Exchange for a gold-level policy. This provision applies to hotels with 100 or more rooms. Workers can enforce these rights by filing a complaint with the City of Seattle or filing suit in King County Superior Court. Penalties issued against hotels go to the complainant, affected workers, and the city Office of Civil Rights. The measure prohibits employer retaliation for exercising any of these rights. The law has a rebuttable presumption that any adverse action taken against an employee within 90 days of exercising any of these rights is an act of illegal retaliation. =Union-shop exemption= Except for the provisions relating to assault, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, every part of this measure can be waived in a union-shop through collective bargaining. Debate =Opposition= The Seattle Times editorial board opposed the initiative. They wrote, \\"If the safety of Seattle hotel employees is a problem, the laws that protect them should be strengthened. Seattle ballot Initiative 124 is a sloppy, possibly illegal first draft that should be rejected by voters.\\" =Support= Seattle Weekly endorsed the initiative. They wrote, \\"Critics of the initiative‚Äîlargely hotel-industry representatives‚Äîcall the measure's stipulations overreaching and Draconian. They say many hotels already have these kinds of protections in place. They also point to I-124's union-exemption clause: If workers belong to a union, their hotel will not be subject to some of the measure's stipulations, to allow for freer collective bargaining. We ourselves recognize that the union exemption may be faintly disguised self-interest; employers might find the law onerous, leading them to encourage unionization in hopes of a better deal. But if the byproduct of passing I-124 is a stronger local union, so be it. We believe the result is a step toward justice for a long-exploited class of workers, union-backed or no.\\" Litigation The American Hotel & Lodging Association, its Washington state chapter, and its Seattle chapter all filed suit in Washington state court to block Initiative Measure 124 in December 2016. Their complaint says, \\"The potential for mistakes and abuse is significant, especially because the hotels are allowed no opportunity to determine whether there was actually any wrongdoing, and guests are allowed no opportunity to refute the allegations. The blacklist provision requires hotels to punish people (by placing them on a list and denying some of them accommodations) without any opportunity to investigate the allegations.\\" The suit also claimed that the initiative violated the single subject rule written into the Seattle city charter. The complaint says, \\"Neither the ballot title nor the concise statement express the multiple subjects of Initiative 124 (I-124), particularly those which deal with compensation and fringe benefits, legal standards for discrimination claims, and the novel and disturbing requirement that hotels deny accommodation to certain guests without notice or a chance to respond to allegations.\\" On December 24, 2018, a Washington State Court of Appeals threw out I-124 in its entirety, holding that it unconstitutionally contains multiple unrelated topics. After a King County Superior Court ruled in favor of the initiative, the state Supreme Court last January declined to hear a direct appeal and sent it to the Court of Appeals for further review. The Appeals Court found that I-124 contains multiple separate parts, including: * protecting workers who must enter guests‚Äô hotel rooms from sexual harassment and assault by providing panic buttons and requiring hotels to maintain a list of guests who have been accused of sexual assault or harassment; * requiring hotel employers to provide and use safety devices and safeguards, and prohibiting large hotels from requiring hotel workers to clean more than 5000 square feet per 8-hour day without time-and-a- half pay; * requiring large hotel employers to provide healthcare subsidies to hotel workers or the equivalent of a gold-level healthcare policy; * when a hotel changes ownership, requiring the new owner to hire from the list of employees prior to the sale for the first six months.

In the Lucas‚ÄìWashburn model, the inertia of the fluid is ignored, leading to the assumption that flow is continuous under constant viscous laminar Poiseuille flow conditions without considering effects of mass transport undergoing acceleration occurring at the start of flow and at points of changing internal capillary geometry. The Bosanquet equation is a differential equation that is second-order in the time derivative, similar to Newton's Second Law, and therefore takes into account the fluid inertia. Equations of motion, like the Washburn's equation, that attempt to explain a velocity (instead of acceleration) as proportional to a driving force are often described with the term Aristotelian mechanics.Arthur Stinner, \\"The story of force: from Aristotle to Einstein\\", Phys. Educ. 29. (1994) Definition When using the notation eta for dynamic viscosity, theta for the liquid-solid contact angle, gamma for surface tension , rho for the fluid density, t for time, and r for the cross-sectional radius of the capillary and x for the distance the fluid has advanced, the Bosanquet equation of motion isJoachim Schoelkopf , Patrick A. C. Gane, Cathy J. Ridgway, OMYA AG, Oftringen, Switzerland and G. Peter Matthews, \\"Influence of Inertia on Liquid Absorption into Paper Coating Structures\\", University of Plymouth, UK : frac{d}{dt}left( pi r^2 rho x frac{dx}{dt}right) + 8pi eta x frac{dx}{dt} = 2pi r gamma cos theta, assuming that the motion is completely driven by surface tension, with no applied pressure at either end of the capillary tube. Solution The solution of the Bosanquet equation can be split into two timescales, firstly to account for the initial motion of the fluid by considering a solution in the limit of time approaching 0 giving the form : x^2(t) - x^2(0) = frac{2b}{a}left[ t - frac{1}{a}(1-e^{-at})right] where : a = frac{8eta}{rho r^2} and : b = frac{2gamma cos theta}{rho r}. For the condition of short time this shows a meniscus front position proportional to time rather than the Lucas-Washburn square root of time, and the independence of viscosity demonstrates plug flow. As time increases after the initial time of acceleration, the equation decays to the familiar Lucas- Washburn form dependent on viscosity and the square root of time.

Stipend and support  The Cusanuswerk awards public funds to \\"particularly gifted catholic students of all disciplines.\\" = Application = For admission, candidates have to apply at the organization or suggested for application by university lecturers or high school teachers. The selection is a multi-step procedure. At its end, around one quarter of all applicants will be admitted. Admission depends on three main criteria including academic performance, social engagement and catholic denomination. Admission is possible starting at the entrance to university but also at later stages as long as five semesters of standard study period remain. An annual exhibition is organized for applicants studying arts, displaying works of all nominated applicants. = Financial support = Financial support is subject to the rules by the Federal Ministry of Education. It consists of either a fixed monthly lump-sum or a more generous means-tested scholarship for students in need, similar to the regulations of the BAf√∂G. Doctoral students receive a scholarship independent of their financial background. Additional support is available for study and research stays abroad. = Academic support = The academic support includes regular educational events as well as a spiritual enrichment program. It is expected that support recipients attend an annual summer school organized by the Cusanuswerk. During their studies, Cusanuswerk scholarship holders form groups at the location of their college. An appointed liaison professor provides additional support. All local scholarship groups elect representatives. Representatives of all local groups meet semiannually for a joint assembly (Cusanerkonferenz). Social engagement and the acquisition of international experience are particularly encouraged for scholarship holders.

History  Carabinieri units devoted to the riot control and to tactical tasks experienced several organizational phases, from late 1910s to the present day. While from 1919 until 1963 Carabinieri riot units were under the exclusive control of Carabinieri Legions (inter-provincial commands), since 1963 they have been under an unified command: from 1963 to 2000 the Command was set at the Brigade level, while the present-day Division was established in 2001. = 1919-1923 = The history of the branch of the Carabinieri specifically dedicated to quell massive civil disturbances dates back in 1919, when 18 Carabinieri Autonomous Mobile Battalions (Battaglioni Mobili Autonomi) were established in order to deal with the Biennio Rosso. Before 1919, the operational approach to riot control consisted in drawing Carabinieri from the territorial stations near the event, replacing them with Carabinieri drawn in turn from other Stations. Since 1908 several proposes had been made by Carabinieri officers to form organic Carabinieri units in order to not to divert Carabinieri from the territorial police service and to improve the harmony within the ranks of Carabinieri assigned to public order services.pp. 271‚Äì273 the proposal was suspended due to the outbreak of the World War One.p. 14 At the end of the World War One, the Royal Italian Army was reduced in size and both the Royal Carabinieri and the Royal Guard of Public Security were augmented.p. 268 Following the end of the War, participants to rallies increased in numbers and Army units deployed in internal order services significantly decreased. The Arm of Carabinieri, in order to sustain the increasingly heavy duty, established for the first time outside war several Army-style Battalions.pp. 269‚Äì270 On 7 December 1918, the Carabinieri General Command elaborated a proposal for War Minister Alberico Albricci, assuming the establishment of 15p. 282 to 16p. 16 Mobile Battalions under the relevant Carabinieri Legion. The total strength of the Mobile Battalions was envisioned in 5,000 Carabinieri. According to the proposal, each Battalion should have had 5 trucks with attached drivers and mechanics, two motorcycles for commanders of the detachments and a light car for the commanding Colonel.pp. 280‚Äì282 Under the 1918 proposal, Legions with two Mobile Battalions assigned were to be led by a Brigadier General, with two Colonels, one of which assigned to the task of commanding the Battalioni Group.p. 16 On 13 March 1919, the War Ministry ordered the provisional establishment of 16 Carabinieri Mobile Battalions, whose organization was to be dealt with by the General Command.p. 16 On 30 March 1919, Commandant General Luigi Cauvin issued executive orders for the establishment of the Mobile Battalions of the Royal Carabinieri. According to Article 3 of the executive orders, the Carabinieri Mobile Battalion was organized into:p. 17 * 3 Infantry Companies, (4 Platoons each); * 1 Cyclists Companies (2 Platoons). Each Mobile Battalion was to be led by a Lieutenant Colonel (Mobile Battalions of Alessandria, Genoa, Verona, Trieste, Treviso, Bologna, Ancona, Cagliari, Bari, two of the three Battalions of Rome, one of the two Battalions of Turin, Milan, Naples, Florence and Palermo)p. 19 or by a Major (Mobile Battalions of Udine, Taranto, Catania, one Mobile Battalion in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Naples and Palermo),p. 19 assisted by an Aide ranking Lieutenant, each Company was to be led by a Captain, while Platoons could be led by a Lieutenant, a Second Lieutenant or by a senior Sub- Officer.p. 17 The strength of each Mobile Battalions was to be 782 officers and troops. According to Article 7, Carabinieri of the Mobile Battalions were to be deployed in organic units (Platoon, Company, or the whole Battalion) always under their own subofficers and officers. The training was specifically designed for public order and riot control services.pp. 284‚Äì286 One quarter of the strength of each battalion was to be assigned to the territorial support of the relevant Legion.p. 17 Battalions were to be housed in separate barracks from other Royal Carabinieri and, in case of more than one Battalion assigned to the same city, on the opposite side of the urban centre; at least one officer had to be housed in the barracks.p. 18 After the widespread civil unrest of Spring-Summer 1919,p.105 the Carabinieri accelerated on the establishment of the Mobile Battalions, despite personnel shortages.p.106 On 25 August 1919, another study elaborated by the General Command proposed the establishment of Mobile Battalions as a quick reaction force, also in response to insurrections to be dealt with by the Army; the following day, a memorandum by the General Command advised against the establishment of the military Royal Guard of Public Security, a standing corps with military status dealing exclusively with civil disturbances.p.107 The 1919 proposal envisioned therefore a mechanized unit consisting of Cyclist Companies, special trains (also available for natural disasters), and fast trucks; the training for personnel assigned to the Battalions was designed in order to improve the cohesion and decision.pp. 283‚Äì284 The Royal Decree of 2 October 1919, no. 1802 sanctioned the existing situation, authorizing the establishment of the Carabinieri Mobile Battalions.p. 21 By force of the Royal Decree of 20 April 1920, no. 451, eighteen Autonomous Mobile Battalions were established for a total strength of 12,282 troops.pp. 279‚Äì280 The autonomous mobile Battalions took the name of their seat and were marked with serial number if more than one Battalion were assigned in the same city: Turin (2 Battalions), Alessandria, Genoa, Milan (2 Battalions), Verona, Florence, Bologna, Ancona, Rome (2 Battalions), Naples (2 Battalions), Bari, Palermo, Catania. The 1920 Battalions were organized on: * 3 Carabinieri on foot companies; * 1 Cyclist Carabinieri Company; * 1 Machine-guns Section (2 Sections for seven Mobile Battalions: Torino 1¬∞, Milano 1¬∞, Firenze, Roma 1¬∞, Roma 2¬∞, Roma 3¬∞, Palermo).p. 24 Each Battalion had a total force of 750 men under the command of a lieutenant colonel.pp. 279‚Äì280 Mobile Battalions in Alessandria, Treviso, Cagliari, Catanzaro and Messina were established outside the 1918 plan, due to evolving needs.pp. 280‚Äì282 Two years later, in 1922, six Battalions were disestablished and at the next year the remaining Battalions followed. However, three Battalions subordinated to the local Legion remained in existence: two in Rome and one in Palermo. In December 1922, the Royal Guard of Public Security (a military corps exclusively dedicated to riot control operations) was merged into the Carabinieri.p. 407  Operations  The first period of existence of Mobile Battalions was short but intense. In 1919 the most serious disturbances occurred in Novara, Milan, Brescia, Rome, Piombino, Viareggio, Corenza and Venice, Apulia and Piedmont. The 1st Bersaglieri Regiment mutinied in Ancona in June 1920, but it was brought down by a Carabinieri Battalion. In 1921 serious disturbances erupted in several municipalities of Campania, including Castellamare di Stabia, in the major towns and cities of Tuscany, in Apulia, including Bari, and in Rome. In the same years, the Blackshirts movement clashed with leftist formations and strikes increased. Between 1919 and 1920, the Carabinieri performed 233 public order and riot control operations and suffered 517 casualties (43 dead and 474 wounded). Facing increasingly combative demonstrations, the government authorities left loose rules of engagement to the police forces, with the result of bloody clashes. According to Arnaldo Grilli and Antonio Picci, between 1919 and 1922, Carabinieri Mobile Battalions were awarded with 2 Gold Medals of Military Valour, 55 Silver Medals of Military Valour, 62 Bronze Medals of Military Valour, as well as hundreds of Solemn commendations. = 1940-1963 = In 1940 the new Army organization foresaw four Carabinieri Battalions, while in 1945 12 Battalions (renamed Mobile Battalions) were re- established, in order to deal with the civil unrest following the end of the civil war, alongside with four Mobile Battalions Groups. The 1945-established Mobile Battalions were equipped, supplied and maintained by the relevant Carabinieri Legion. The Mobile Battalions Groups were: * 1st Group (HQ Milan), subordinated to the 1st Carabinieri Division \\"Pastrengo\\" and including Battalions based in Turin, Milan, Genoa and Padua; * 2nd Group (HQ Florence), subordinated to the 2nd Carabinieri Division \\"Podgora\\", including Bologna and Florence Battalions; * 3rd Group (HQ Rome), subordinated to the 2nd Carabinieri Division \\"Podgora\\", including Battalions \\"Lazio\\", \\"Rome\\" and \\"Cagliari\\"; * 4th Group (HQ Naples), subordinated to the 3rd Carabinieri Division \\"Ogaden\\", with Naples, Bari and Palermo Battalions. The Mobile Battalions were provided of new vehicles in order to enable them to deploy rapidly. In the immediate aftermaths of World War Two, both police and Carabinieri were strictly prohibited by armistice clauses to have hand grenades, machine guns, rifles and even handguns.pp. 63‚Äì64 Ferruccio Parri, Prime Minister in 1945, supported the reinforcement of the Carabinieri in order to enable them to counter threats to public order.p. 64,85 In 1945 Carabinieri sustained 29 casualties during public order services.p. 67 In 1949 Minister of Interior Mario Scelba asked the General Command of the Carabinieri and Minister of Defence Randolfo Pacciardi to provide Carabinieri of batons and other riot-specific equipment. Both the General Command and the Defence Minister refused.pp. 144‚Äì146 According to Virgilio Ilari, as of 1949 the Carabinieri mobile forces consisted of 13 Battalions and 34 Trucked Units (Nuclei Autocarrati), with an updated equipment. On 6 August 1956, the blue beret was assigned to mobile units (Mobile Battalions and Trucked Units). On 26 August 1949, the Banditry Repression Forces Command was established under Colonel Ugo Luca.p. 170 Between 1951 and 1963, a new Parachute Carabinieri Battalion was established.p. 183 After the end of the Second World War, in Italy occurred several security crisis: banditism in Sicily and in Sardinia, and civil disturbances across the country.pp. 168‚Äì169 Such disturbances were politically motivated and, as such, differently reported.pp. 61‚Äì63 In the aftermaths of World War Two (between 1946 and 1948), Carabinieri managed to evade the majority of the riot control operations;p. 89,135 nonetheless, during riot control operations carried out from the end of the war to 1948, 101 Carabinieri died, while 757 others were wounded. According to Antonio Sannino, the fact that the Carabinieri remained hostile to Communists' political approaches caused the British support to them.p. 86 Between 1945 and 1948, Carabinieri underwent a massive rearmament in order to deal with institutional duties. In 1945 they had only 5 armoured vehicles and 79 trucks; in 1948 Carabinieri deployed 264 armoured vehicles and 1358 trucks.p. 521 = 1963-2000 = Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo established the XI Mechanized Brigade when he was Carabinieri Commandant-General. Following the 1960 Genoa clashes, a reform project for the Mobile Battalions was envisioned, but later abandoned. Both the organization and the equipment (which included old Sherman tanks) were found to be obsolete either inadequate to emergency tasks.p. 48 On 27 January 1963, Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo formulated a proposal to reorganize riot units. In this proposal, Mobile Battalions were to be available for both wartime and peacetime tasks, with a wartime organization and a reduced peacetime one;pp. 497‚Äì498 the proposal also suggested that mounted Carabinieri were to be concentrated in robust cavalry units.p. 498 On 1 April 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command led by Giovanni De Lorenzo, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The first commander of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was Brigadier General Franco Picchiotti.p. 514 The establishment of the new brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order and riot control. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions' speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. On the other hand, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade had only support tasks, the Interior Ministry retained the power of deployment of Carabinieri Battalions through the General Command and the Brigade Command.p. 521 The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was controversial: some senior officers criticized the decision, deeming that the essential features of the Carabinieri were capillarity and focus on criminal police activity.p. 48 Ferruccio Parri deemed that the establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was purported to form an \\"Army within an Army\\", ready to intervene in the political balance.p. 492 Overall, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles, 130 M47 tanks and a paratroopers battalion. However, the brigade never had responsibility for actual unitary operational command, lacking supports due to a political choice, but exercised the tasks of instruction and preparation for the riot control activities. In the 1963 reorganization, Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks; According original resolutions, Regiments were to have only disciplinary, training and deployment functions, while general management rested within the relevant Legion. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion- level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. Each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a lieutenant colonel or a major and consisted of: * 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon), 2 Rifle Companies (command platoon, 3 rifle platoons, 1 company weapons platoon each); * 1 Mortars Company and 1 Tanks Company (Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons). It was therefore a robust tactical complex. The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the local organization of the Carabinieri they had found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool. Within the VII Battalion, based in Laives, the Counter- terrorism Special Company was established in 1960s to counter South Tyrolean terrorism;p. 187 the security operations were also supported by several Trucked Units. Both VII and XIII Battalions were to be always maintained at their full wartime force. The 1963 reorganization did not mark the end of the organizational shifts. In 1964, 1st Carabinieri Helicopter Section was established. The XI Brigade was subordinated, on 7 March 1965, to the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Special Units, which included not only the XI Mechanized Brigade, but also all other tactical Carabinieri units: the Carabinieri Paratroopers Battalion, the Territorial Squadrons Groups of Milan, Cagliari and Palermo, the Trucked Units, as well as the naval service. Two years later, on 10 March 1967, the post was modified in \\"Inspectorate of Mechanized Units\\", being disbanded in May 1967. In 1968 the blue beret was modified, making it identical in shape to the maroon beret used by paratroopers. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. In 1969, under the command of former partisan Brigadier General Pietro Loretelli,p. 532 Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of Battalion Command Unit, Command and Services Company (Command and Services Platoon, Scouts Platoon, Transmissions Platoon, Tanks Platoon, Transportations Platoon), 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, Mortars Platoons). According General Adamo Markert, as of 1969, the most prepared Carabinieri Battalions were headquartered in Gorizia, Bolzano, and Padua, ready for engagement in war.p. 519 Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade; the 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment was renamed Mounted Carabinieri Regiment. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. In 1977, the three Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and 4th Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment changed its name in Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment, with the Battalions being directly under the Brigade Command. The following year an Inspecting Colonel was appointed, while in 1979 two additional Colonels followed. In 1980, the Inspectorate changed its name to Carabinieri Schools and Special Carabinieri Units Division \\"Palidoro\\". In 1985, the Command was deprived of training component and was reorganized on the XI Brigade (Carabinieri Battalions) and the XII Brigade (specialist units); the brigade was therefore placed under a command called Carabinieri Mobile and Special Units Division \\"Palidoro\\". Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of unit the unit deployed.  Operations  During the Years of Lead and the subsequent period, however, most of the Battalions reduced their military training in order to deal with riot control activities. 7th and 13th Battalions maintained instead their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control. Each infantry company of each Battalion established, in this period, an \\"Intervention Platoon\\", in order to upgrade the responsiveness to serious riots.p. 191 In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the XIII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", IV Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" and VII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services. In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204 During the Years of Lead and the subsequent period, however, most of the Battalions reduced their military training in order to deal with riot control activities. 7th and 13th Battalions maintained instead their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control.

The 1st Carabinieri Group in Milan and the 2nd Carabinieri in Rome were established in the 1990s within the 11th Brigade; these units were renamed, in 1995, respectively Carabinieri Regiment in Milan and Carabinieri Regiment in Rome. In 1996, the 1st Carabinieri Battalion was transformed in the 1st Parachute Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\", although it remained within Paratroopers Brigade Folgore until 2002. = 2001-present day = Protesters burn a Carabinieri vehicle during the 27th G8 summit. In 2001, when the Carabinieri were elevated to the rank of autonomous Armed Force, the 11th Mechanized Brigade was reorganized into the present-day Carabinieri Mobile Units Division. From 2002 to 2013, the headquarters have been based in Treviso; in 2013 they were transferred in Rome. During the first years of existence as Division, the strength was over 6,000 units: 6,712 troops as of 2002, 6,500 troops in 2004.  Operations  The first major engagement of the newly formed Brigade was the 27th G8 summit, a major protest, drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Clashed erupted heavily; 329 people were arrested and over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes. On the occasion, Carabinieri formed the shortly-existed Compagnie di contenimento e intervento risolutivo, units formed with personnel drawn from existing Battalions of the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade (Battalions \\"Lombardia\\", \\"Lazio\\", \\"Toscana\\", \\"Campania\\" and \\"Sicilia\\"), integrated with personnel drawn from the more military-oriented 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade. Critics of the CCIR frequently point out the militarization of police brought by the establishment of such units. On July 20, 23-year-old activist Carlo Giuliani of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a Carabiniere, during clashes with police. On 14 July 2007, 13 Italian Carabineri, GOMPI Mobile and prison police were convicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office and uniform. Other charges included abuse and negligence.  Division commanders  Since its establishment, the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division has been led by eight Major Generals: * Gen. D. Luciano Gottardo (2001-2002); * Gen. D. Michele Franz√© (2005-2006); * Gen. D. Giuseppe Barraco; * Gen. D. Leonardo Leso (2007-2009); * Gen. D. Umberto Pinotti (2009-2011); * Gen. D. Vincenzo Coppola; * Gen. D. Silvio Ghiselli; * Gen. D. Maurizio Detalmo Mezzavilla (2016‚Äìpresent).  Mission  The Carabinieri Mobile Units Division, through its Brigades, is tasked with: * The performance of military duties of the Carabinieri associated with the integrated defence of the national territory and participation in military operations abroad; * The performance of military police tasks against Italian Armed Forces deployed overseas; * The support of the Carabinieri territorial organization in riot control activities and to increase the control of the territory in large urban areas and in the most sensitive areas in terms of public security; * The participation in civil protection operations; * The ensuring reserve of the General Command, a ready and reactive mass maneuvering force to cope with various emergencies. = Military operations abroad = Abroad, Carabinieri guarantee, exclusively, the Military Police in support of Italian contingents and provide MSU (Multinational Specialized Unit) and IPU (Integrated Police Unit) Regiments. The Division provide resources and personnel for several missions abroad. Current missions are carried out on behalf of the United Nations, NATO, European Union and on behalf of other international agreements. UN missions * Cyprus: United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP); * Lebanon: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). NATO missions * Afghanistan: NATO Training Mission - Afghanistan (NTM-A); * Kosovo: Kosovo Force (KFOR).

Tariel enjoyed the support of King Solomon II of Imereti, whom he joined in an uprising against the Imperial Russian encroachment in 1810.  Biography  Manuchar was a son of Katsia II Dadiani by his third wife Anna Tsulukidze. In 1791, King Solomon II of Imereti, who sought to unite all of western Georgia under his authority, deposed Grigol Dadiani and replaced him by his more amenable brother Manuchar. Manuchar's positions was soon tattered by Grigol's continuing efforts to comeback and he had to seek refuge in neighboring Abkhazia. Solomon then briefly installed Tariel as prince-regnant, but Grigol prevailed by 1794. With Solomon's renewed offensive in Mingrelia in 1802, Grigol was once again deposed and replaced by Tariel, but the king's success was short-lived. Grigol was able to resume his tenure and placed, in 1804, Mingrelia under the Russian protection. When Prince Grigol died in October 1804, his young son and successor Levan was placed under regency of the princess dowager Nino. Tariel, like his brother Manuchar, quickly withdraw in opposition to the new government, further exasperated by Nino's efforts to dispossess her opponents of their estates. By January 1810, Tariel and Manuchar had been in an open revolt. Tariel entrenched himself at the castle of Dzhgali. When a combined Mingrelian-Russian force moved against him, Tariel agreed to surrender provided his estates were confirmed to him. Princess Nino reneged on her promise and Tariel fled to Solomon II of Imereti, joining him in resistance to the Russians. After Solomon's defeat, Tariel moved to the highland province of Lechkhumi and, together with the nobleman Beri Gelovani, induced the locals to take to arms, but the disturbances were quickly contained through Nino's diplomacy. Tariel then joined Solomon in his exile in Akhaltsikhe, in the Ottoman territory and subsequently resided with his in- laws in Guria. Eventually, he reconciled with his nephew Levan, who assumed full ruling powers after Nino was sidelined by the Russian authorities from the Mingrelian government. In 1833, Tariel led a mission to bring Levan's defiant nephew, Dimitri Sharvashidze of Samurzakano, to justice, which ended in Dimitri being killed during a skirmish in Chuburkhinji.  Family  Tariel was married to a daughter of Simon II Gurieli. He had six children, whose descendants still survive.

It was first published in paperback on August 9, 2016 through Night Shade Books in the United States and United Kingdom. The work alternately follows two writers both before and after one of them is murdered. Synopsis The book follows two horror writers, Colleen Danzig and Panos Panossian, the latter of whom is strongly disliked in the Lovecraft literary community. Both writers are attending the Summer Tentacular, a Lovecraft themed convention held in Providence, Rhode Island, and sharing a room together. Before the first day of the convention's end, Panossian is brutally murdered, his face peeled off of his body, mimicking an anonymous post left for Panossian on his blog by someone years ago who appears to know a great deal about his past. The novel's chapters alternatively follow both writers. The third-person chapters following Colleen are partially set before Panossian's murder while his chapters are told after his death, as his disembodied consciousness drifts around the convention following participants and thinking about his past. Panossian can feel his nerves dying and his brain shriveling like a ‚Äòsponge in the sun‚Äô, and he spends his time lamenting over not remembering who it was that killed him, trying to figure it out, and letting his mind drift into long monologues about his past and opinions, his thoughts on Lovecraft, and his opinions on the other con-goers. Colleen recklessly searches for the truth and believes that there's a connection between \\"Arkham,\\" the book Panossian was supposed to be selling when he died, and who killed him. The book is rumored to be bound in human skin. She corners Chloe, another one of the authors, in a bathroom where a physical altercation takes place. She then convinces Hiram to give her a ride with partial lies. The truth is that they're following a group of others from the con into the forest, where she believes they're doing something related to the murder. She calls the police and it's revealed that they were just trying to locate the grave of H.P. Lovecraft's long-deceased cat. Colleen is taken in for questioning many times, and is banned from the convention for her assault on Chloe. From the Mortuary, Panossian can hear the interrogations and uses them to further speculate on who may have killed him. After the night in the woods, Colleen finds out that another writer from the con was killed: Charles Cudmore, who she mentally calls \\"asparagus head\\" due to his malformed head and haircut. His death is dissimilar to Panossians, leading Colleen to believe that he was killed because he knew too much. She goes to Norman, another's con-attendee's room to look for more info after finding out that a drag queen named Ms. Phantasia and Chloe have been accused. She doesn't get much from this encounter and ends up having to take part in a group attempt to summon Cthulhu. She is taken into custody once more when the police arrive, and during her subsequent interrogation believes that the police are trying to hint at her to help. She is given an eventful ride back to the hotel for the closing ceremonies. During an odd speech on Christianity, Hiram tries to hint at her to leave but it's too late. Colleen is tackled because it's believed that she's the real killer. She manages to escape and an officer drives her out of state. Whilst at the airport, she is looking into some of the con-goers and their pasts and is struck by inspiration. She returns to Providence. From his position, Panossian hears who murdered him reveal themself, an exchange that is overheard by Colleen and Hiram. The book ends with gunshots and Colleen whispering to an unknown other person that it will be okay as Panossian finally slips away for good. Reception Publishers Weekly and NPR both reviewed the work, the latter of which felt that the book's coverage of a niche fandom harmed more than helped the book because \\"As deep as the book gets, it's equally narrow, and no matter how accessible Mamatas makes his mystery, it's still mired in the in-fighting and minutia of a subculture that few can relate to.\\" Tor.com was critical of I Am Providence, writing \\"Clearly, there are some great ideas in here, but even if you can get past the flat characters and the circumnavigative narrative and the nastiness of the entire enterprise, I Am Providence goes nowhere of note, oh-so-slowly.\\" Locus Online and Fangoria were more favorable towards the work, with Locus Online stating that \\"Mythos fans, mystery fans, and convention-goers (some of us are all three!) will all find plenty to like here.\\" References American mystery novels ","title":"I Am Providence (Mamatas novel)"},{"id":"53413616","text":"Rodrigo C√°rdenas, O.P.

She currently resides in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Her most recent artworks have been short silent films set to music. Atkins's films are either shown alone or within an installation. Early life and education Atkins grew up in rural Manitoba from where she still draws inspiration citing the landscape of her youth as a significant influence. Fiber art was Atkins' area of study when she undertook her undergraduate degree at Alberta College of Art and Design where she graduated with distinction in 2001.  Career  Her work has been exhibited across Canada and the USA. A dreamlike or fairy-tale character is often attributed to Atkins's work. Repeated motifs include loose teeth, the colour red, fields of snow, and bicycles. Women on journeys are equally a recurring theme in her work as are vast landscapes inspired by her experience of the Canadian prairies. Atkins' early short films were shot on Super 8 while the most recent Three Minute Miracle was shot on 16 mm film. Using film as a support and textiles contributes to the many textural references in Atkins's work. The work Three Minute Miracle was largely inspired by different fibre-focused projects she had previously undertaken. Atkins's participated in \\"Oh Canada\\" at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) which showcased over 60 artists, showing her film \\"Three Minute Miracle\\". The aim of the exhibition was to create a dialogue about contemporary art made in Canada. In 2003 she founded the Bike Ballet Club: a cycling trio. She is the co-founder and an active member of the Optronic Eye Film Club. In 2013 she was nominated for the Sobey Award.

The river is approximately long, and includes the tributaries of the Osmington Brook and the Preston River. The River Jordan discharges into the English Channel at Bowleaze Cove, northeast of Weymouth.  Etymology  The river's name is the same derivation as that of the nearby Jordan Hill, most probably from the Old English \\"cerr d≈´n\\" meaning \\"hill at the bend\\" (thus \\"Jordan Hill\\" is tautological). The former spelling of the name, Jordon, includes the later Common Brittonic suffix \\"-don\\", also derived from the Old English \\"d≈´n\\". A second possible origin is that \\"Jordan\\" is derived from \\"Chur d≈´n\\", or \\"hill on the River Chur\\". The Place-names of Dorset (1989) references the 16th century spelling \\"Jordain\\", and suggests that the river (and hill) are either named after the Jo(u)rdan family of Dorset, or simply after the River Jordan in the Middle East. The river is sometimes referred to as the Preston River, after one of the river's two tributaries.  Course  The river is fed by two streams rising in the Dorset Downs; the source of the Preston River is Spring Bottom, approximately north of Sutton Poyntz. The other stream, known as the Osmington Brook, rises further east near Osmington. This area of the Dorset Downs is part of the Wessex Ridgeway; the springs emerge from the upper chalk of the escarpment. From its sources, the river flows into Sutton Poyntz where the two streams converge. The northern branch of the river fed two corn mills‚ÄîSutton Upper Mill (also known as Sutton Poyntz Mill) and Sutton Mill. Upper Mill‚Äîalong with Sutton Poyntz as a whole‚Äîwas the inspiration for the mill and village of Overcombe in Thomas Hardy's The Trumpet-Major. The stream here forms the village duck pond, which was created as the mill race for Sutton Mill. After the streams' confluence, the river flows south into the village of Preston, where a third corn mill was situated. Downstream of the mill, the river is crossed by Roman Bridge. Although the name suggests the bridge is of Roman origin, it is more likely to have been built after the Norman conquest of England‚Äîa hypothesis supported by Charles Warne and Sir Talbot Baker. Continuing south, the river flows to the east of Jordan Hill and bisects the site of Preston Roman Villa‚Äîalthough at the time of the construction of the Romano-British building, the river's course was different. The river discharges into Bowleaze Cove, a small sand and shingle beach on the Jurassic Coast and part of Weymouth Bay. An agreement was made in the 19th century involving the Weymouth Waterworks Company, wherein the upstream course of the river would be diverted via pipes to accommodate pumping facilities. = Crossings =  Osmington Brook  Near its source, the Osmington Brook is bridged at Hall's Farm, and is crossed by an inland section of the South West Coast Path. A number of footpaths cross the brook at Northdown Farm, after which it is crossed by Sutton Road in Sutton Poyntz shortly upstream of the confluence with the Preston River.  Preston River  The first crossing of the Preston River is Mission Hall Lane, which is named after the 19th-century mission hall owned by Salisbury Diocese. Upstream of Sutton Mill, a footbridge crosses the mill race before it is fed under the mill buildings. Downstream of the mill, the river is crossed by Sutton Road and Puddledock Lane, before joining with the Osmington Brook.  History  Evidence exists of Neolithic and Iron Age inhabitation of the land near the river. A Roman villa was built on the banks of the River Jordan, and was in use until the third or fourth century AD‚Äîmuch like the nearby Jordan Hill Roman Temple. It is possible that milling used the river as a source of power as early as the 9th century; the earliest written evidence of the village of Sutton (later named Sutton Poyntz after the 13th-century landowners) was a Saxon charter dating from AD891. The Domesday Survey of 1086 showed that milling was well established in the village by the 11th century, with 12 mills being operational. The river featured in Constable's Weymouth Bay: Bowleaze Cove and Jordon Hill (1816‚Äì17); it is likely that the inspiration from the painting originated with Constable's honeymoon to Osmington in 1816. The canvas is displayed in the National Gallery; Constable painted a similar (but larger) version entitled Osmington Shore which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1819. SS Great Eastern after decommissioning from Weymouth Waterworks The Weymouth Waterworks Company was established in 1797, and in 1856 the company employed Thomas Hawksley to convert Upper Mill on the Jordan in Sutton Poyntz into a pumping station to supply water to Weymouth. Following the fatal explosion of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's SS Great Eastern in 1859, the vessel was towed to the Isle of Portland and Weymouth Waterworks Company purchased the damaged ship's no. 1 funnel, subsequently using it in their filtration system. The funnel was decommissioned in 2004, and Wessex Water donated it to the SS Great Britain Trust in Bristol. = Flooding = The latter half of the 20th century saw extensive flooding of the river at Sutton Poyntz and Preston. Floods occurred in 1955, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1993 and 2003, and the Environment Agency established the River Jordan Flood Alleviation Scheme to investigate methods of flood prevention. At this time, the agency designated the river as a Critical Ordinary Watercourse (COW). Studies concluded that flooding was caused by silting of the river near Preston Mill, the constriction of flow through bridge arches, and obstructions of culverts. It is likely that heavy rainfall exacerbates the flooding, particularly through increased discharge of the Preston Brook.

It was recorded in S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo, Brazil and in Seattle, Washington, United States, with the help of producers Barrett Martin and Jack Endino. Its lyrics deal with themes such as death, faith, absence of God and passions.  Production and recording  Jardim-Pomar took one year to be prepared due to the fact that Reis had full control over everything, forcing him to work according to his financial situation. For him, \\"this time of maturation was very good for the music, because it could develop to places which otherwise it wouldn't\\". He also defined it as his \\"most complete and complex, most toilsome album, but it came out exactly like I wanted it\\". Released in November 2016, it was ready since April. It was produced by Jack Endino (who had already produced his previous album, Sei, and some albums by Tit√£s, Reis' former band) and Barrett Martin, with whom he collaborated in the past. Commenting on their work, Reis said they \\"are friends and work together, but have totally different methods when producing an album. This brought an unique personality to each song, in spite of them being in a group inside the album, something I always seek\\". For Reis, \\"the work is always a frame of the moment we live in. I prepared it in no hurry, in one year, and it is optimistic and excited, even with some lyrics dealing with sober themes.\\" About the lyrical themes, he commented:  Song information  Reis refers to the single \\"S√≥ Posso Dizer\\" as \\"one of those songs that appear to emerge ready as soon as the first verse and melody show up, almost as in a dream. Jack Endino (producer) told me it looks like a song from another time\\". It is featured in two versions: one recorded in Seattle and a slower one recorded in S√£o Paulo nine months later. Reis compares it to the song \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", by George Harrison, released under two different versions in All Things Must Pass (1970). The song was composed after his wife, V√¢nia, 2,5 years before the album release. \\"It is a beautiful song, somehow sad, but it is also a revision of a long love story which is never linear [...] it is about this love that resists detrition, about knowing what one wants, despite everything. The chorus summarizes it well and cites a verse by Lupic√≠nio: 'N√£o consigo dormir sem seus bra√ßos' [I can't sleep without your arms]. It's shards and sections of a relationship which compose a beautiful mosaic.\\" About the song and its versions, he also said: \\"Inimit√°vel\\" talks about tolerance for differences and was written based on Reis's childhood with a deaf brother and a sister with cerebral palsy; both conditions resulting from their meningitis. \\"4 de Mar√ßo\\" is another song dedicated to V√¢nia, which whom he was for over 30 years by the time of the album release. The date which names the song (4 March) refers to an important event to the couple, but Reis did not want to give any detail. \\"Conc√≥rdia\\" is the only previously released song, composed in the 90s and released in 2003 by Elza Soares in her album Vivo Feliz. \\"Azul de Presunto\\" features, among other artists, the singers Branco Mello, S√©rgio Britto, Arnaldo Antunes and Paulo Miklos, his former colleagues in Tit√£s, despite Antunes not being a member since the early 90s and Miklos having left the band between the recording sessions and the album release. About the song, the first studio recording featuring all of them since Tudo ao Mesmo Tempo Agora (1991) by Tit√£s, Reis said: \\"We realized we did not gather in studio for 25 years and it couldn't be any different because the song has a Tit√£s thing. This song has much to do with our humor, it is provocative and awkward. In another interview, in which he commented the guest performances of other singers, he said: \\"Como Somos\\" is another collaboration of Reis with Skank's Samuel Rosa. Originally, it would be used in the band's 2014 album Velocia, but it was ultimately left aside, despite having been recorded as a demo. About its story, Reis says:  Release  The album was released in digital, CD, cassette and vinil forms ‚Äì in the latter case, due to its total length, it was divided in two parts: Jardim and Pomar.  Reception  = Critical reception = Writing for O Globo, Leonardo Lichote says: \\"Reis conduces the listener through his 'Garden-orchard' as if he walked through the tragic-redemptive trajectory of existence ‚Äì the thematic spine of the album. [...] In the 13 tracks, among Neil Young's grammar, lessons of tradition of the Brazilian music, sounds of steps and writing machines, Reis finds his own demons, more pacified than ever. And gods, be it by christian symbology or by love treated as a divinity ‚Äì tracing in 'Jardim- pomar' a particular Eden.\\" Mauro Ferreira, at G1, said \\"Jardim ‚Äì Pomar is an album commanded by division, already perceivable in its title\\" and concluded that \\"a result of mature reflections on themes such as love, life, death and God, Nando Reis harvest in Jardim ‚Äì Pomar is big.\\" = Accolades = The album won the 2017 Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Rock or Alternative Album and the song \\"S√≥ Posso Dizer\\" was nominated for Best Portuguese Language Song in the same award.

Its collections, exhibits, and other activities focus on the cultural history of the Navajo people. Its activities include traditional museum exhibits, a research library, and programs that help to revive and preserve the Navajo language. Facilities The museum is located in a modern building in Window Rock, Arizona, the capital of the Navajo Nation, next to the Navajo Zoo. It is in the approximate center of a Navajo reservation, about west of Arizona's border with New Mexico. The museum building ‚Äì officially named the Navajo Nation Museum, Library & Visitor's Center ‚Äì also houses the Navajo Nation Library, home to five special collections that support historical, legal, cultural and governmental research. The building is surrounded by the area's typical sandstone cliffs. A trailhead begins outside, leading to an overlook of the reservation. The current building is the product of a long development process. A Navajo Tribal Museum was established in 1961 in a small building on the Window Rock Tribal Fairgrounds. In 1982, it moved to the backroom of an arts and crafts store. In 1997, the current building was constructed at a cost of $7 million. Collections and exhibits The museum collects items that help to document the culture and history of the Navajo people, including selected materials from tribal and non-Indian neighbors. Its extensive holdings include artistic, ethnographic, archaeological, and archival materials. These include over 40,000 photographs and a wide variety of documents, recordings, motion picture film, and videos. The archives are heavily used by authors, researchers, and publishers as a source for historical photographs. Most of the collections are available for on-site study and exhibit loan. The museum maintains an active and professional exhibits program, most of which is produced in-house. Exhibits tend to highlight the work of Navajo artists in various media, including weavings. These art-oriented exhibitions are interspersed with historical and cultural exhibits. A comprehensive, large-scale, long-term exhibition on Navajo culture and history is currently being researched and scripted. Current exhibits include an interpretive video and photographs, artwork, jewelry, and textiles relating to the history and culture of the Navajo people. One describes the arduous 1864 ordeal known as the Long Walk of the Navajo, in which the Navajo were removed from tribal lands and marched some 300 miles to a prison camp in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Another is titled Jo' Jini'‚ÄìIf These Objects Could Talk. Medicine men who share traditional Navajo teachings often end each pronouncement by saying \\"j√≥ jin√≠\\" (\\"that's what I heard\\" or \\"it was said\\"). The exhibit features 60 items, including jewelry, folk art, pottery, historical items and contemporary pieces, contributed by 25 different donors. One such donated piece includes a flag that was flown at Fort Sumner. In 2018 the National Archives loaned the museum the only copy of the 1868 treaty that created the Navajo reservation and ended the incarceration of the Navajo at Fort Sumner. A second copy later surfaced at the home of Samuel F. Tappan, a member of the Indian Peace Commission who had helped to draft the treaty. That copy went to the Bosque Redondo memorial for the anniversary of the treaty's signing. A third copy is thought to have been buried with Barboncito. The exhibits are supplemented by items in the museum's gift shop, which offers books about Navajo culture, jewelry, and other items in the museum's collections. Other activities The museum and its director Manuelito Wheeler (Navajo) have a great interest in reviving and preserving the Navajo language, and in making it accessible to a greater number of Navajos. They worked with LucasFilm to create a Navajo-dubbed version of Star Wars: Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope; the project was completed in 2013. In 2015 they spent a full year collaborating with Pixar on a Navajo-language version of Finding Nemo. Great care was taken in selecting Navajo voice actors and in producing linguistically accurate dubbing. The film, Nemo H√°d√©√©st'√≠√≠, premiered in Albuquerque in 2016 and played in select cities throughout the southwest. It was very well received by Navajo audiences. Wheeler has presented academic lectures on Navajo subjects, including \\"Navajo Identity through Global Projects.\\" Under his direction, the museum worked with world-renowned artist Ai Weiwei, partnering him with Navajo artist Bert Benally to create a site- specific installation piece in a remote canyon on the Navajo Nation.

She was a founder member of the Doll Club of Great Britain, The Dolls' House Society and the Dollmakers Circle. Her archive is held at the V&A; Museum of Childhood in London.  Life  Faith Sybil Eaton was born on 9 January 1927. The family lived at 16 Clifton Gardens, in Maida Vale, West London where Faith remained for most of her life, and which she referred to as her \\"study centre\\".Olivia Bristol, Faith Eaton 1927-2005, Catalogue for sale at Christies, South Kensington, 25 October 2005 Eaton trained as an occupational therapist. Although she had dolls' houses as a child, her serious interest began when she was in her early twenties. She recalled \\"the momentous event\\", around 1950, she found three of her mother's old dolls in a \\"seldom opened cupboard\\". Eaton's interest in repairing dolls was sparked around the same time, when in the 1950s, she was helping to organise a charity exhibition of dolls, and when one of the exhibits was damaged, she managed to repair it. Her collection included doll making in all materials, with international scope. She collected items relating to domestic and social history, including wallpapers, kitchenalia, textiles and costume. In 1959, Eaton was the Exhibition Designer of Dolls Through the Ages, a charity fundraising exhibition held at the Ceylon Tea Centre, Regent Street, London. In 1962 she took part in Toys, an exhibition with The British Toymakers Guild. In 1983, Eaton had a cameo appearance in Smallfilms's television series Tottie: Story of a Dolls House. This adaptation of Rumer Godden's book had human characters as still images, and Faith appeared as the Queen on a visit to a doll exhibition. In 1990, her collection was shown at Sledmere House, in Yorkshire, in the exhibition Treasure of Childhood.

In 1947 she enrolled in the department of Philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 1958 she married the writer Tom√°s Segovia. She won the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1979 for her novel R√≠o subterr√°neo .  Biography  In√©s Camelo Arredondo was born to a middle class family that grew poor later on; her father, Mario Camelo y Vega, was a liberal doctor, and Arredondo was the oldest of nine. She passed a large part of her childhood in the sugar plantation called \\"Eldorado\\" of her maternal grandfather Francisco Arredondo. Between 1936-1944 she studied at the Colegio Montferrant in Culiac√°n, a school run by Spanish nuns. From 1945 to 1946 she studied at the Colegio Aquiles Serd√°n in Guadalajara. In 1947 she enrolled in the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, for a degree in Philosophy. However, she underwent a spiritual crisis as a result of reading Friedrich Nietzsche and S√∏ren Kierkegaard, and due to the skeptical and atheist environment that surrounded her. She became suicidal, at which point her doctor advised her to change her area of study. So, in 1948 she began studying Hispanic Literature. She finished her studies in 1950 with a thesis on \\"Political and social ideas and feelings in Mexican theater, 1900-1950\\" (\\"Sentimientos e ideas pol√≠ticas y sociales en el Teatro Mexicano de 1900 a 1950\\"). Between 1950 and 1952 she studied Drama, and in 1953 she took a Library Science course. During her studies she came to know many people who had been exiled during the Spanish Civil War. The republicans were, for her, a strong counterpoint to the strong nationalist tendencies in Mexico at the time. During this period, she also discovered French existentialism, surrealism, the Generation of 27, and the writing of Juan Rulfo and Juan Jos√© Arreola. She lived with classmates Rosario Castellanos, Jaime Sabines and Rub√©n Bonifaz Nu√±o, and her teachers included Julio Torri, Francisco Monterde and Carlos Pellicer. In 1958, she married writer Tom√°s Segovia, who she shared many interests with. After the birth of their first daughter, In√©s, her second child, Jos√©, was stillborn, leading to another spiritual crisis. Between 1952 and 1955 she worked in the National Library; later, she took the position of Emilio Carballido in the School of Fine Arts for Theater. She collaborated on the drafting of the Dictionary of Latin American Literature edited by UNESCO, and between 1959-1961 she edited the Dictionary of Mexican History and Biographies. She also wrote for radio and television shows and worked as a translator. Her translation work led to the idea for her first original work, \\"El membrillo\\" (published in 1957 in the university magazine). From that point on, she did not stop writing. She gave birth to two more children, Ana and Francisco Segovia, and worked with her husband on the Mexican Literature Review, although her name did not appear on it until she separated from him. Elena Poniatowska said that she was something of a muse, the only woman in her generation, and that Huberto Batis and Juan Garc√≠a Ponce were her \\"admirers\\" (Poniatowska 1994: 2). Several of her stories were published in the Review. In 1961 she received a scholarship from the Mexican Center for Writers and in 1962 she received another one from the Fairfield Foundation in New York. Despite their marital troubles, she and her husband decided to wipe the slate clean and move to Montevideo (Uruguay), where she worked in the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA). However, in 1962 they separated, and In√©s returned to Mexico. Their divorce became official in 1965. As a divorced mother, she held the following positions to support her children: * Member of the editing committee for the Mexican Literature Review until its end in 1965 * Investigator in the Coordination of the Humanities (1965-1975) * Invited to conferences at Indiana University and Purdue University in 1966 * Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), teaching courses on the Golden Age and literature (1965-1968) * Critic in the review section of \\"M√©xico en la cultura\\", supplement to the magazine Siempre! (1965-1967) * Collaborator in the University Radio of UNAM (1965-1970) * Collaborator in the Dictionary of Mexican Writers in the Center for Literary Studies at UNAM (1967) * Professor in the School of Theater in the National Institute of Fine Arts (1965-1967) * Editor in the Department of Information and Press, UNAM (1965-1968) * Co-wrote the feature-length film Mariana with Juan Garc√≠a Ponce (1967) * Professor of History of Theater in the Iberoamerican University (1970) * Researcher in the Center for Historical Studies of Mexico, CONDUMEX (1966-1973) En 1965 she published her first book of short stories, La Se√±al (The Signal). From this point on, the short story was her preferred style; Only Opus 123 (1983) could be considered a short novel. Perhaps as a result of her excessive workload or her psychological conflicts she began to have issues with her spinal column. She underwent five operations and spent many years in a wheelchair. During this period, Elena Poniatowska described her as \\"A bedridden women with an indomitable spirit\\". In 1972 she remarried with the surgeon Carlos Ruiz S√°nchez. She picked up her literary studies again, and wrote her masters thesis on the Mexican poet and essayist, Jorge Cuesta. In 1980 she finished her studies with an honorable mention. In 1979 she published her second book, R√≠o subterr√°neo (Underground River), which won the Xavier Villaurrutia Award and critical praise.¬´Premio Xavier Villaurrutia¬ª . El poder de la palabra. Consultado el 7 de diciembre de 2009. In 1979 the US Library of Congress in Washington, DC made recordings of three of her stories for the series Voz Viva de M√©xico (Live voice of Mexico). In 1983 the editorial Oasis publish Opus 123, and one year later her children's story Historia Verdadera de una Princesa (True Story of a Princess) was published. In 1988, her final book of short stories, Los espejos (The Mirrors) was published. In the same year she edited her Obras Completas (Complete Works) with the publisher Siglo XXI. Around her 60th birthday she received several prizes and honors, the most important being an honorary degree from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa on May 27, 1988.¬´Doctor honoris causa otorgados¬ª . Universidad Aut√≥noma de Sinaloa. Consultado el 22 de febrero de 2011. In November 1988, a festival dedicated to her was organized in Culiac√°n. She spent the last years of her life confined to her bed and on November 2, 1989 she died in her apartment in Mexico City.  Literary works  = About her works and contexts = In√©s Arrendondo‚Äôs work was a turning point for Mexican literature, especially that written by women due to the taboo topics she embarked on in her many works. Her main focus was family and partner relationships. Her stories questioned roles and the status quo. Not only did she expand on eroticism, madness, death, perversion, love, passion, voyeurism, loss of innocence, infidelity and betrayal, but she also denounced hidden secrets in Mexican families, such as sexual abuse, the abuse between parents to their children, authoritarianism, machismo, abortion, incest and bullying. Her work as a literary critic and essay writer is reflected and captured in a series of texts published by different magazines and cultural supplements of Mexico throughout her time, in which she left her footprint as an intellectual reader and cultural promoter. Today all these texts can be found under the book titled Ensayos, written by Ines Arredondo and published in 2012. In the book she emphasizes her autobiography and the extensive study she conducted on Jorge Cuesta, An original investigation that she analyzed for the first time in Mexico, on one of the main examples of the Contempor√°neos (Contemporary) group. Arredondo like many others of her time, was a loyal followers of his works. Arredondo was part of the Half Century Generation, a decade that consists of the forties to the mid-fifties. This time period became definitive for many Mexican artists of all sorts. Arredondo was also baptized as a member of the Casa del Lago (The Lake House Group), of ‚ÄúLa Revista Mexicana de Literatura‚Äù ( The Mexican Literature Magazine). The members of The Lake House Group not only developed a creative play, they also did critical work with different artistic approaches such as theater, cinema, painting, music, poetry, novels, tales and essays, while also working with topics that were once censored in Mexico. During Arredondo‚Äôs lifetime she received four official recognitions from the Mexican government and from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa (Universidad Aut√≥noma de Sinaloa or (UAS). Arredondo received the medal ‚ÄúFray Bernardo de Balbuena‚Äù granted for the first time in the history of Sinaloa in November 1986. An honorary ceremony was held in Culiacan, Mexico in recognition of Arredonodo‚Äôs literary merits on March 1987. An honorary doctorate was given to her by the UAS on May 1988. There was also a second tribute made for her for her quality literary work during the cultural festival of Sinaloa in 1988.

The significance of the multiple dispersal steps on the plant fitness and population dynamics depends on the type of dispersers involved. In many cases, secondary seed dispersal by (typically granivorous) invertebrates or rodents moves seeds over a relatively short distance and a large proportion of the seeds may be lost to seed predation within this step. Longer dispersal distances and potentially larger ecological consequences follow from sequential endochory by two different animals, i.e. diploendozoochory: a primary disperser that initially consumes the seed, and a secondary, carnivorous animal that kills and eats the primary consumer along with the seeds in the prey's digestive tract, and then transports the seed further in its own digestive tract. More than one dispersal vector (abiotic or biotic) is thought to be involved in the majority of seed dispersal events (on average 2.15 dispersal vectors in Dutch ecosystems). Seeds may be transported in turn by various animal or abiotic mechanisms such as wind or water.  Types of diplochory  Six main types of diplochory have been identified based on the dispersal mechanisms involved: # Wind dispersal (anemochory) & scatter- hoarding (caching) by animals # Ballistic dispersal and myrmechory (dispersal by ants) # Endozoochory and dung beetles # Endozoochory and synzoochory # Endozoochory and myrmechory # Endozoochory and endozoochory #Synzoochory and synzoochory Diplochory can be beneficial to plants in several ways. When the final phase involves a scatter-hoarder, plant seeds may experience lower predation risk. The caching of seeds by animals such as rodents or birds protects those seeds from being eaten by other seed predators, and because seed hoarders do not recover all the seeds they cached, it may prevent those seeds from being eaten altogether. Ants and dung beetles may also deposit seeds in highly nutritious and fertile habitats that are very favorable for plant growth. = Diploendozoochory = Diploendozoochory is a special form of diplochory in which all stages of the seed dispersal process involve endozoochory by animals. For example, many animals that feed on fruits or seeds are important prey species for a multitude of predators. Where they fall prey while carrying seeds in their digestive system, predators may act as secondary seed dispersers. This kind of predator-assisted seed dispersal was first described by Charles Darwin in 1859, and sporadic observations have since been recorded. The phenomenon has been studied in most detail in an island system with lizards and raptors that prey on them. In the Canary Islands, frugivorous Atlantic lizards (Gallotia atlantica) consume Lycium intricatum fruit, and thus seeds from the fruit are found in their feces. The lizards are eaten by southern grey shrikes (Lanius meridionalis), and the shrike feces contained seeds from the fruit consumed by the lizards along with lizard remains. On these same islands, common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and invasive domestic cats (Felis catus) may also consume these lizards and dispersing the seeds from the lizards‚Äô guts. These lizards also consume other plant species whose seeds may be dispersed by the lizards‚Äô predators, such as Rubia fruticosa, Plocama pendula, and Asparagus nesiotes. Another example of diploendozoochory is that cougars (Puma concolor) eat eared doves (Zenaida auriculata), and as a result disperse seeds from lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), panic grass (Panicum bergii), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Secondary seed dispersal by predators can influence the dispersal distance, habitat in which the seed is deposited, or seed germination potential, that cause seed dispersal outcomes that differ from those of the plant's primary dispersers. While the second phase of diplochory often involves very small-scale movement of the seeds, diploendozoochory can lead to much increased dispersal distance. This is the case especially when the secondary disperser has a larger home range size, is more mobile, or more generalistic in its habitat use than the primary disperser. Because carnivores tend to range over large areas, they can thus help plants colonize new suitable habitats where the possible range changes due to climate change, or reach remote areas such as islands. Alternative means of dispersal may affect ecological processes such as colonization of disturbed habitats, maintaining gene flow between sites in fragmented habitats, or facilitating long-distance dispersal. Carnivore involvement may also change the predicted patterns of the spread of invasive species, shifting ranges of plant species along climatic gradients, or the recovery of disturbed habitats. In habitats increasingly changed by humans, the presence and actions of carnivores may become increasingly important. It has also been suggested that plants may have evolved adaptations to benefit from such multi-phase dispersal, making this a mutualistic process. For example, some evidence suggests that island populations have more thick-coated seeds relative to mainland, which may be an adaptation by the plants to tolerate a longer (or multi-phase) digestion as the seeds are transported long distances. However, as the phenomenon has rarely been studied systematically, the prevalence of this seed dispersal mechanism and its importance for plant dispersal is not well understood.

It is a common species in the region and although mangroves are threatened by habitat destruction and climate change, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". thumb Description Ceriops australis is a small evergreen tree or shrub growing to a maximum height of about . The growth habit is columnar or multi-stemmed and it develops large buttress roots. The bark is silvery-grey to orangeish-brown, smooth with occasional lenticels. The leaves are in opposite pairs, glossy yellowish-green above, obovate with entire margins, up to long and wide. The flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils; each has a short calyx tube and parts in fives or sixes. The fruit is pear-shaped, suspended from the shrunken calyx tube. Brown at first, it changes colour as it matures and the hypocotyl emerges. The hypocotyl is long, slender and smooth, reaching a length of up to . This mangrove is viviparous, the propagule emerging from the end of the fruit, falling from the tree and developing into a new plant. It is very similar in appearance to Ceriops tagal and grows alongside it; previously thought to be the same species, it has now been shown to be genetically distinct. The difference between the two can be observed when the tree is fruiting, C. tagal having ribbed hypocotyls while those of C. australis are smooth. Distribution and habitat In tropical northern Australia, C. australis is the dominant mangrove in estuarine habitats, its range extending from Exmouth in Western Australia to the southern end of Moreton Bay in Queensland. Its status in New Guinea is less clear, because of the confusion in the past with C. tagal. It does not tolerate strong wave action, high winds or strong currents, but prefers drier sites, with high salinities on the landward side of the coastal mangrove strip and bordering salt pans. Uses Indigenous Australians have traditionally used this tree to make sticks for digging and throwing, and for spear shafts. An infusion of the inner bark has been used to treat skin problems, and the outer bark as a dye and for tanning. The larvae of the moth Syntherata janetta feed on the foliage.

The pit was excavated in the 1920s and 1930s with gravel being removed from the site. Over the years plants and wildlife have colonised the area and it is now mature. History This gravel-pit is one of a number of pits in this area formed when deposits of sand and gravel from the floodplain of the nearby Thames were excavated in open cast mining activities. Following removal of the minerals, any disused pits were allowed to flood with water, and gradually returned to nature. The present lake had reached 50 acres by the 1930s. At some stage the lake must have been stocked with carp and other coarse fish, and now provides good angling. SSSI The site consists of a steep-sided lake and adjoining strips of scrubland and patches of trees. The SSSI is of major national importance for the gadwall, which visit it in winter, and is also made use of by other waterfowl such as the northern shoveler, the Smew, the tufted duck, the common pochard and the common goldeneye. It is also visited in winter by the great crested grebe, the great cormorant and the Eurasian coot. The terrestrial habitat supports many birds including the Eurasian treecreeper, the garden warbler, the great spotted woodpecker and the Eurasian hobby.

History The 21 cm SK L/45 was the primary armament of the armored cruiser SMS Bl√ºcher. Krupp produced a total of sixteen guns, twelve of which were installed in six twin DRL C/06 turrets, one pair fore and one pair aft, and two pairs in wing turrets on either side of the superstructure, each weighing . The guns were supplied with a total of 1,020 shells, or 85 rounds per gun.

During the Second World War, these same guns were reemployed by coastal artillery units of the Wehrmacht. During World War II they were supplied with improved shells and larger propellant charges for increased range.

Early life and education  Edma Morisot was born in 1839 in Valenciennes, France. Brought up largely in Paris, Edma Morisot received a bourgeois education, like her sisters Yves and Berth, that included piano and drawing. All three sisters were encouraged to pursue drawing by their mother, who had them first study with the neoclassical painter Geoffroy Alphonse Chocane in 1857. Edma and Berthe both wanted to pursue their training further, which led them to take lessons under the well-regarded painter Joseph Guichard, a former student of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. According to Armand Forreau's 1925 biography of Berthe Morisot, Guichard is said to have warned their mother: > \\"With natures like those of your daughters my teaching will not confer the > meagre talent of genteel accomplishment, they will become painters. Do you > have any idea what that means? In your milieu of the grande bourgeoisie it > would be a revolution.\\" Guichard encouraged the young women to copy paintings at the Louvre, which the two women visited chaperoned by their mother. There, they met the artist F√©lix Bracquemond in 1859, who introduced them to Henri Fantin-Latour. The Morisot sisters soon tired of copying the old masters, and in 1860 they began to study with the Barbizon painter Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, who taught them to paint en plein air. In 1863, when Corot became too busy to continue to instruct them, Edma and Berthe came under the tutelage of another Barbican painting, Achille Fran√ßois Oudinot. The sisters later broke with Oudinot on acrimonious terms, and they later referred to Corot. as their teacher who introduced them to several artists including Edouard Manet.  Career  thumb Edma's landscape paintings were strongly influenced by the Barbizon style of her instructors, such as Corot. She painted numerous landscapes, but in 1863 she also turned to portraiture. That year, she painted a remarkable portrait of her sister Berthe (now in a private collection), which shows her concentrating in front of her canvas. In 1864 she submitted two paintings to the annual Salon, both of which were accepted. She also submitted paintings that were accepted in 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1868. In 1867 Edma also sent three paintings to a provincial exhibition in Bordeaux, one of many organised by the Friends of Art societies. The sisters sold, or at least tried to sell, paintings through Alfred Cadart. Her paintings, which now reside in private collections, largely comprise landscapes and portraits. Portrait of the Artist's Sister by Edma Morisot (1863) = Relationship to Berthe Morisot = The two sisters were close in their youth, supporting and constructively critiquing each other as they developed as painters. \\"In her crucial, formative years,\\" Berthe \\"depended most of all on her sister. Behind Berthe Morisot was Edma Morisot.\\" A portrait of Berthe by Edma, from 1863, is probably the earliest surviving picture of Berthe. The two sisters were known to travel together, exhibit together, and often painted side by side. The two women, best friends and companions for 12 years, keenly felt the separation brought about by Edma's marriage. In their mature years, her role as confidant and supporter in Berthe's life was replaced by Eug√®ne Manet, the brother of √âdouard Manet, whom Berthe married in 1874. Throughout her life Edma often modelled for her sister's paintings, and can be seen in the following works: * Edma Morisot lisant 1867 Cleveland museum of art * Portrait de Mme Pontillon 1869 National Gallery of Art Washington, DC * Portrait de Mme Pontillon n√©e Edma Morisot, s≈ìur de l'artiste8 1871 Mus√©e d'Orsay * Le berceau 1872 Mus√©e d'Orsay : le tableau repr√©sente Edma Morisot pr√®s du berceau de sa fille Blanche * Chasse aux papillons 1874 Mus√©e d'Orsay : les personnages sont Edma Morisot et ses filles Jeanne et Blanche  Later life  On 8 March 1869, Edma married Adolphe Pontillon, a naval officer and long-time friend of √âdouard Manet. The couple moved to Lorient in Brittany. Edma's career as an artist effectively ceased following her marriage. She painted a portrait of her husband and executed some pastel copies of Berthe's work, but other artistic production during her marriage remains unknown. Edma died in Paris in 1921.

He was proprietor of a Prussian cavalry regiment in the years 1758‚Äì1778. Austrian service Robert Scipio, Freiherr von Lentulus, descended from an old Roman noble family (formerly called Linser) that emigrated to the city of Bern in approximately 1592.

In the War of Polish Succession Lentulus participated in the 1734 campaign in Italy as the adjutant of the Field marshal, Count Claude Florimond de Mercy, who fell on 28 June in the Battle of San Pietro (sometimes called the Battle of Parma). In 1735, he joined the campaign in the Rhineland. He fought later in the Austro-Turkish War of 1737‚Äì39 and from 1742‚Äì44 in the campaigns in Bavarian and Bohemia during the War of Austrian Succession. Lentulus was also consulted on military-diplomatic negotiations after the armistice of 1735 and the border regulation between the Banat and Serbia after the Belgrade Peace. When the opportunity arose, Lentulus undertook lengthy journeys in Italy and the Orient. A decisive factor for Lentulus's further career was his behavior against the Prussian commander, Gottfried Emanuel von Einsiedel, during the Second Silesian War on 16 September 1744. The Austrian commander at Prague, Ferdinand Philipp von Harsch, had agreed to capitulate after a two-week siege. Lentulus, at that time captain, refused to sign the capitulation certificate and, instead, broke his sword: he had been commanded to fight to defend Prague, but not to surrender.Haller, Franz Ludwig)[WS 1], Leben des General- Lieutenants R.

Prussian service Lentulus initially refused Frederick's request, but left the Austrian army to go to Bern. After the peace settlement of 1745, Prince Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau intervened with Lentulus and convinced him to enter the Prussian army. Lentulus entered the Prussian army in 1746 as a cavalry officer with a major's commission. Frederick appointed him as a wing adjutant and revised his officer's patent (commission) to the date of the surrender of Prague. Lentulus married Elisabeth Luise Henriette Auguste Sophie, a daughter of the Minister of State and Count Frederick Albert von Schwerin; upon their marriage Frederick addressed an ode to the couple. During the Seven Years' War, Lentulus served at the royal headquarters and was sent on several diplomatic missions; and after the Battle of Lobositz, he delivered the victory message to London. He then fought at the Battle of Prague and, subsequently, at the Battle of Kolin. He particularly distinguished himself at the Battle of Rossbach when he pursued the fleeing French army. Subsequently, Lentulus led a brigade formed by the Garde du Corps Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 13 and the Gens d'Armes Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 10. In the Battle of Leuthen, under command of Major General Hans Joachim von Zieten, he again distinguished himself in the attack on the Austrian left flank, and Frederick gave him a reward of a thousand thalers. In 1757, Lentulus was promoted to major general. In 1758, Lentulus was named proprietor of Leibregiment zu Pferde Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 3, an office that he would hold until 1778. In April 1758, he took part in the Siege of Schweidnitz with seven cuirassier regiments and then moved with Frederick's army to Moravia. In the battles of Zorndorf and Hochkirch, he again led by example. In 1759 he served in Silesia. In 1760, he fought at the head of two dragoon regiments in the Battle of Liegnitz, and commanded the post roads in Silesia in the following winter. The end of his service in this war was, for Lentulus, the Battle of Reichenbach on 16 August 1762. =Swiss projects= In 1767, Frederick appointed Lentulus lieutenant general, and in 1768, he was appointed governor of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland, then under Prussian rule. He was officially governor of the city following the Gaudot Affair, a series of demonstrations against the change in tithing and tenancy regulations.Dominique Quadroni, Gaudot Affair, Historischen Lexikon der Schweiz, 17/5/2005, Accessed 7 March 2017. Lentulus gave up the office in 1779. As during his entire career in Prussia, Lentulus often belonged to the king's closest circles, especially during the years after the war, where he was valued because of his education and intelligence. As early as 1752 Lentulus was present at the wedding of the brother of King, Henry, with the Hessian Princess Wilhelmine. In 1769, Lentulus was present in Neisse at the meeting of Frederick II with Austrian Emperor Joseph II. Following the First Partition of Poland, Frederick sent him to East Prussia in 1773 to take possession of the newly-acquired province and to establish Prussian rule. In 1778‚Äì79, Lentulus took part in the service of Prince Henry during the War of Bavarian Succession, but retired because of his old age. Upon his retirement, Lentulus returned to Bern, where he headed the military system. On the recommendation of Lentulus, the city and the Republic of Bern had already formed the first three J√§ger companies in 1768 from good marksmen of the upper regiments. Memorials and honors Lentulus died in 1786 on his estate at Parc de Mon Repos near Bern, where his grave is located on the highest point of the Lentulus hill, named after him. Nearby, a street was named after Lentulus. He was Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. In 1851, his name was included on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, among the other men who helped to found the modern Prussian state.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Gro√üen.

In 1766 the opposition to the new system, which conferred considerable advantages to the prince, was published: no one was willing to buy the high-priced tenancies. Frederick II finally proposed the sale of all tithes to the highest bidders, which caused a storm of indignation among the Neuch√¢tes; they saw in it a disregard for the principle of sovereignty which had been guaranteed to them in 1707, and demanded the restoration of the old system.Dominique Quadroni, Gaudot Affair, Historischen Lexikon der Schweiz, 17/5/2005, Accessed 7 March 2017. In May 1767 Frederick II decided to call the Bernese as arbitrators. Both parties stubbornly defended their position. The representative of the General Prosecutor of the Principality, Claude Gaudot (1713-68), was particularly relentless in his condemnation of Neuch√¢tel. At the beginning of 1768 the Grand Council of Bern accused Neuch√¢tel of violating the prince's rights. The rage of the citizens of Neuch√¢tel was so great that Frederick authorized a Bernese military force to intervene. Although Lucerne, Solothurn, Freiburg, and the ambassador of France attempted to moderate, Bern recruited and gathered 9,000 men to the east of the principality to frightened the citizens of Neuch√¢tel and Valangins. Frederick II appointed Gaudot as the representative of the Bernese lieutenant colonel to Neuch√¢tel. When he returned to the city, he was lynched by the population on 25 April 1768, without the authorities taking the slightest step to protect him. One month later, 600 soldiers from the four allied estates occupied Neuch√¢tel. The affair ended in August with the complete subjugation of the city. Robert Scipio von Lentulus was subsequently appointed governor of the city. Eric- Andr√© Klauser, Lentulus, Robert Scipio v., Historischen Lexikon der Schweiz, 30/11/2007 version.

History Innerjuvalt was built about south-east of the older Hochjuvalt Castle by the Freiherr von Juvalt(a). It was built in two parts on a narrow rocky outcropping above the entrance to the Domleschg Valley. The upper castle was first built around 1250 and was expanded around 1273. In 1342 two of the von Juvalt family, Albrecht and Bertram, appeared in a probate court to settle their inheritance, with Bertram giving up his rights to Innerjuvalt. In 1372 Elgof and Friedrich von Juvalt divided the inheritance again, with Eglof receiving the castle, its meadows, a mill and vineyards. In 1382 Egolf's wife Ursula was living in the castle. In 1423 Rudolf von Juvalt was ordered to continually live in the castle, but by 1440 they had moved to the more accessible lower castle. However, they added a third story to the tower in the late 15th century. In 1462 Barbara von Juvalt sold the castle to her brother in law Pedrutt von Wannis. A few decades later it was abandoned and by 1570 was described as a ruin. Castle site The upper castle was built around 1250 as a two-story palas, probably to house workers as they completed the castle. A two-story main tower and an attached residential wing were added to the north-east of the palas. A third story was added to the tower in the late 15th century. A wall was built on lower western side of the outcropping, with the remainder protected by steep cliffs. A bakery and a cistern were built along this wall. Beginning in 1979 the communities of Domleschg and the Burgenvereine Graub√ºnden added a new roof and repaired and rebuilt the castle. The ruins were excavated in 1980, 1982 and 1990. Today the castle grounds are open for visitors and the tower can be rented by small groups. The lower castle was built at the foot of the cliff. It consisted of a ring wall with a gatehouse on the southern side. A large palas or residential building was built along the wall. The northern side of the courtyard was terraced for farming. Today very little of the lower castle remains.

Creation A Jewish population is known to have existed on Inca since Jaume I conquered Majorca in 1229, although their presence had already been reported by Severus, bishop of Menorca, in the 5th century. The origin of the Jewish quarter (named call in Catalan) dates from a 1346 order issued by king Peter IV of Aragon upon request from the Governor of Majorca, Gilabert de Centelles, because of disturbances caused by the mostly Christian inhabitants of Inca, who were displeased with the widespread presence of Jews in the town. The Governor's lieutenant, Berenguer de Oms, aided by an advisor, made the first proposal for a location for the Jewish quarter. The Jewish community directly informed the king about their refusal of the proposed location because the place known as \\"Carrer d'en Prats\\" had houses in utter disrepair. King Peter IV agreed and informed Gilabert de Centelles about the reservations the Jews had about the place, and ordered that a legal expert trusted by the community be appointed to pick a proper location. Because Gilabert de Centelles was due to travel to Valencia and Catalonia on royal business, he delegated the task on Guillermo de Lagostera, who arrived at Inca in 1353 together with legal expert Ramon de Capeir as well as Jaume de Buadella, who was a jury in Palma. They met with the juries of Inca and the secretaries of the aljama and reached an agreement on the place called \\"Carrer d'en Pascolet.\\" From then on, economic troubles began. The already existing houses were confiscated, and Jews were charged a price for them that owners did not accept. A period of almost 24 years of constant reclamations to the Governor and to the King ensued. The King decreed that the difference between the appraised value of the houses and the amount paid for them would need to be covered by the University of Inca, which sparked confrontations between house owners and the university. A committee of two Christians and two Jews was appointed to negotiate the sale and rent prices for the houses in the call, but the University sent a written complaint to the King and the whole process was paralyzed for 10 years. The Governor then gave the order to comply with the King's mandate and resume the process, but it was not actually done until 1363, under new Governor Bernardo de Tous. A new appraisal committee, with two Christians named Montroig and Palou, and two Jews named Faquim and Fallux, was chosen. No written record of the place exists between 1363 and 1372. It is known that the previous owners of the confiscated houses appealed to the authorities with new complaints about the prices. In 1372, the secretaries of the aljama filed a complaint because routine attacks by Christians on Jews were pushing Jews to leave. Governor Tous ordered the building of two gates to keep the Jewish quarter enclosed so Christians would not assault Jews. Until then only one gate had existed, called En Reboll. Jews are believed to have taken possession of the call between September and October 1372. In 1391, at the time when Christians were launching attacks on Jewish communities in Aragon and Castile, the ones in Inca and Palma suffered a similar fate, and houses and businesses were burned down. Historical importance The Jewish quarter of Inca can be considered the secondary aljama of Majorca. The main one was in Palma, but beginning in 1383 the secretaries of the aljama in Palma delegated functions on their peers in Inca, making the community effectively independent. This arrangement was short-lived as the neighborhood was destroyed in 1391 and most of the survivors converted to Christianity. All evidences indicate that the call had a synagogue. In documents from 1392, convert Bartomeua claimed inheritance rights on properties owned by her grandfather \\"Jucef Ben Baharon, rabbi of the Jewish School of the Call.\\" In the town map made by Dr. Sebasti√† Sans in 1808, the Jewish quarter appears as \\"El Call\\" and numbered with 10. Based on an investigation conducted by Antoni Ginard, Joan Estrany and Francesca Tugores at the University of the Balearic Islands, Jeroni de Berard is currently believed to have made in 1790 the oldest map of Inca, later used by his sometimes collaborator Sebasti√† Sans to make his own in 1808. The owners of the house of Can Monroig, formerly known as Can Mora, carried out a process of total restoration. During the excavation, they found architectural remains and pottery likely dating from the call or Muslim times. Current location Jewish Quarter of Inca The Jewish call can be found between Sant Francesc, Virtut, Can Valella, Pare Cerd√†, El Call, and La Rosa streets.  Population  Approximately 306 people are estimated to have lived in the call, most of which worked in crafts and trading.

He is the son of Hinaya Shigetsugu. Nisshin was the first to use the concept of \\"fuju fuse\\" (‰∏çÂèó‰∏çÊñΩÁæ©) which is to neither give nor receive alms. He received the posthumous name Kud≈ç Shigeruin (‰πÖÈÅ†ÊàêÈô¢). Biography Nisshin was born in Kazusa province on October 14, 1407. After receiving instruction from his paternal uncle Nichiei, Nisshin entered Hokekyo-ji. In 1427, Nisshin travelled towards the capital stopping at various temples along the way in Kamakura, Kyoto, and other such cities. As he did so, he spread his teachings. In 1433 he continued towards Hizen province as a head priest of the Nakayamonry≈´ lineage with some followers. However, due to harsh shakubu preachings, Nisshin himself was heavily opposed and eventually expelled from the Nakayamonry≈´ lineage. Then in 1437 as Nisshin made his way still towards the capital, he opened Honp≈ç-ji. Along the way, he was also able to convert many temples into those following the Nichiren school of Buddhism. In doing such, he gained the opportunity to preach to the sh≈çgun of the time, Ashikaga Yoshinori. Nisshin used this time to preach about not giving alms to temples. This talk unfortunately aggravated the sh≈çgun so that he placed a ban upon Nisshin's sermons. Nisshin, of course, couldn't stop himself from spreading his teachings and violated the ban. In 1440, he was imprisoned as punishment for breaking the ban and his temple destroyed. He continued to preach even during his imprisonment. As the legend goes, during his imprisonment, Nisshin had a pot put over his head to shut him up. It's said not even a scolding hot pot could make Nisshin stop sermonizing. This story became known as the tale of the ‚Äúpot-wearing saint‚Äù or sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthe pot-wearing Nisshin.‚Äù In 1441, during the Kakitsu era, there was the Kakitsu uprising. This uprising saw the assassination of the 6th sh≈çgun. Because of this, Nisshin was able to escape his imprisonment and began rebuilding his temple Honp≈ç-ji. The year 1460 however saw the destruction of Honp≈ç-ji once again. This was because Nisshin had continued to preach despite the previous ban on his actions. The temple was destroyed and Nisshin was summoned to the capital by the 8th sh≈çgun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Nisshin was escorted by Chiba Mototane to Kyoto. He was taken to the residence of Hosokawa Mochikata to be imprisoned this time. While imprisoned there, he made the acquaintance of Hon'ami Honk≈ç (Kiyonobu), of the distinguished Hon'ami family of sword experts.Papinot, E. Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan. Rutland, Vermont, and Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing Co., 1972. ., who became his devout follower. The two were both able to become free from their imprisonment thanks to the collaboration of local lords. These lords also frequently gave to Honp≈ç-ji. Nisshin continued preaching in Honp≈ç-ji until his death in 1488 at the age of 82 years-old. Nisshin and Fuju Fuse Most famous of Nisshin's practices was that of the Fuju Fuse‚Äîrefusing to accept or give donations to others outside of the Hokke lineages. This practice was meant to portray an image of self-sustaining and self-governing ability within the sect. In doing so, Nisshin's line had not only regained some power to the organization but began to set a competitive tone against legal authorities. This would add fuel to the later fires of movements to remove more power from Buddhist organizations and the subsequent destruction of temples. Nisshin's Personality Nisshin was greatly revered for his skill in his monastic life. Virtuous Deeds, written by Honji-in Nissho, gave a hagiographical recount of his life, frequently highlighting his swift understanding of teachings as well as his strong ability to convert others. Nisshin had followed heavily in the footsteps of Japanese priest Nichiren‚Äîfounder of Nichiren Buddhism‚Äîtaking up a willful suffering for the Lotus Sutra or practicing \\"admonishing of the state\\" as Nichiren had. Nisshin had faced imprisonment for three days for his admonishing, which he met with thankful pleasure in being able to serve the Lotus Sutra so sacrificially. Out of respect to Nichiren's original views, he wished to preserve the exclusivity of the organization to maintain its purity regardless of intra-sect opposition. Temples Nisshin established the Honp≈ç-ji temple in 1436, the temple represents a branch of the prevalent Nichiren buddhist sect. Honp≈ç-ji was originally located at Higashi-no-toin Ayanokoji. The temple was destroyed in a fire in 1440, by the Sh≈çgun Yoshinori. The temple was rebuilt in 1455 near Shijo Takakura by Emperor Go- Hanazono. In 1460, the hapless fate of the burning of the Honp≈ç-ji temple arose again. The arson was an order given by the sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who's reasons for the fire rested on propagandistic affairs. The temple however, achieved reconstruction and relocated to Sanjo Madenokoji in 1460. The temple was prosperous for a period of time, but faced another twist of fate when it had to relocate once again. It was later rebuilt near the Ichijo Modoribashi bridge along the narrow Horikawa river. Honp≈ç-ji's final and current location resides near Ogawa Teranouchi. The temple is also extremely renowned because its relocation was enforced during the period of the reconstruction and reorganization of the city by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587. Jojakko-ji temple was also founded in (1561-1617) by Nisshin and is located in the Arashiyama area. It is a well known Nichiren sect temple and was the place where Nisshin spent his life in retirement in 1596.

The objective is to protect non-smokers in confined areas from second-hand smoke. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the law was extended to cover \\"inhalant delivery systems\\" such as e-cigarettes. Provisions and exceptions The Indoor Clean Air Act was passed by the Oregon state legislature in 1981. In order to protect non-smokers from second- hand smoke, the law prohibited smoking, except in designated smoking areas, in public \\"confined\\" areas, which it defined as retail stores, banks, grocery stores, meeting rooms, and commercial establishments, but excluding such areas as cocktail lounges, offices occupied only by a smoker, a public meeting hall being used in a private capacity, a tobacco retail store, and a restaurant seating fewer than 30 people. , the law also forbids smoking outside within of windows, air vents, entrances and exits, and ramps leading to or from them. Effective January 1, 2016, the law was also extended to include \\"inhalant delivery systems\\" that use a vapor or aerosol, such as e-cigarettes.  Rules and Regulations  thumb The Oregon Health Authority has varied rules and regulations pertaining to both citizens and businesses regarding the Oregon Indoor Clean Air act. Initially, when these regulations are thought to have been violated, a claim or complaint has to be made to the Local Public Health Administrators (LPHA), the administrative force for the Oregon Indoor Clean Air act. It is then determined if the site has to be smoke and vapor free in accordance with ORS 433.835 through 433.850. Signs will be posted on site, except where defined in OAR 333-015-0035, for a smoke free area. These signs will either state that ten feet around the site is a prohibited smoke and vapor free area(s), or that the entirety of the area(s) is a smoke and vapor free zone. Violations of the act include smoking, and or the use of aerosolizing or vaporizing equipment within ten feet of: Entrances, Exits, Windows that open, Ventilation intakes, and Accessibility ramps. If notified of a violation by any party, the site or business will receive a warning from the LPHA, alerting them to fix the behavior present. If another offense is reported to the LPHA by form of complaint within 5 days of the first response from the LPHA, they will take further action and make an unannounced visit of the site to determine if the act is being violated. If found to be in violation upon the inspection, penalties will be incurred. These penalties include fines that begin at an amount of $300 per day of each violation for the first violation, second of $400 per day, and the third and any subsequent violations $500 per day. Later developments In 1997 Oregon launched a statewide Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) with the goal of reducing tobacco-related illnesses and deaths. TPEP was created immediately after the passage of Measure 44, under which tobacco excise taxes were raised by thirty cents and 10% dedicated to funding TPEP. TPEP partners with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs. They also collaborate with public and private entities and community organizations. In November 1998, The Oregon Department of Environmental Equality asked a participatory group to develop a program to reduce the impact of air toxins in Oregon. Oregon's Department of Environmental Equality was partnered with this program until the new air toxins rule in Oregon was passed. The new rule requires that in specific geographic areas of high risk, a risk reduction plan must be developed. For example, air polluters can be required to assess the impact of their activities and implement technological solutions to mitigate it. In 2000, Oregon Restaurant Association v. City of Corvallis affirmed that cities had the right to enact their own, more strict ordinances on smoking and led the way towards removing preemption with the Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act. However, until this law passed in 2009, preemption allowed all cities to enact their own regulations for tobacco smoking to include establishments not explicitly defined in ORS 433.835. In 2007, the Oregon Clean Air Act (O.R.S. ¬ß¬ß 433.835 et seq. (2007)) passed to remove preemption and include bars, restaurants, and all workplaces as smoke-free.  Effects  An enclosed area either owned by a public or private employer must regulate this rule for their employees during their course of employment. Workplaces that must be smoke free include: bars, employee break rooms, restaurants, hotels, motels, retail and wholesale establishments, this list is not limited to other facilities. Smoke-free laws help protect restaurants and bar employees and patrons from the harm of secondhand smoke. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. OICAA helps seven out of every ten smokers who want to quit smoking by providing those individuals with public environment free from any pressure or temptation to smoke. The National Cancer Institute in December 2016 conducted a review of economic literature on tobacco control; evidence shows that smoke- free policies like OICAA does not cause adverse economic outcomes for businesses included restaurants and bars. In 2009 reported by International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there is sufficient evidence that implements smoke free legislation decreasing respiratory symptoms in workers. NSBI also commented on this matter presenting that after reviewing economic variables that bars located in areas that have been already smoke free, sold for similar prices for bars with no restrictions. In 2010 an analysis conducted on economics based on smoke-free laws stated \\"There is clear evidence that smoke free legislation does not hurt restaurant, and in some cases business may improve.\\" References Oregon statutes 1981 in Oregon 1981 in American law ","title":"Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act"},{"id":"53415055","text":"Kosiruddin Talukder is a Bangladesh doctor who died in the Bangladesh Liberation war and is considered a \\"martyr\\" in Bangladesh.

Life  Born in 1859, she was the daughter of the painter and traveller Robert Elwes (1819-1878), and gentleman‚Äôs daughter Mary Frances Lucas. Ysabel Elwes was baptised in Congham, Norfolk, on 4 October 1859. On 24 February 1881, she married Henry Birkbeck, a London-born banker. The couple had seven children, including three daughters: Gillian Mary, born 1883; Judith, born 1888; and Ysabel, born 1891. The Birkbecks were rich. In 1898, they bought West Acre estate, including the Georgian High House from the Hamond family (Ysabel was related to the Hamond family through her paternal grandmother, Susan Hamond). Oldest daughter Gillian married Joseph Gurney Barclay in 1905. The couple lived in Cambridge for a while, entertaining undergraduates at their house on Grange Road. In February 1908 the couple set off as missionaries to Japan. They settled in Kobe, and Gillian kept a diary of their work and life (now at Durham University Library), including her dilemmas over how much to decorate her home, how to dress, and whom to mix with. In January 1909, Ysabel Birkbeck headed to visit her oldest daughter in Japan, taking younger daughters Judith and Yasabel along too. Younger Isabel kept diaries recording the whole journey, including photographs and her own drawings of the scenes and people they saw (also at Durham). They arrived in time for the birth of Gillian‚Äôs son, Roderick Edward, whom Ysabel sketched ‚Äúaged 18 hours‚Äù. Gillian died on 15 May 1909, aged 26, while her mother and sisters were with her. Ysabel, Ysabel and Judith returned to Europe via Canada, arriving in Vancouver on the 1 July. On the date of the 1911 census, Ysabel the elder is at Westacre with four of her children. In the First World War, Ysabel and Henry‚Äôs second son, Captain Gervase William Birkbeck, was killed in the First Battle of Gaza in 1917. Their youngest daughter Ysabel Birkbeck also saw very active service in the First World War, driving an ambulance in Russia, the story of which can be read in Forgotten Heroines, her published illustrated diary. After the First world War, Ysabel Birkbeck started to make Westacre dolls‚Äô house furniture, including women and children from the village in the production. They used Liberty print fabrics over wire and beads, and sold their miniature sets to toy shops around the country. Beryl Watts (1906 - 2007), a Westacre villager, started working for Birkbeck while still a schoolgirl, then moved into service for the Birkbecks (her duties included going ahead to Kinloch Hourn in the Scottish Highlands to prepare the family‚Äôs holiday house). By the 1930s she was also a leading figure in the dolls‚Äô house furniture business. Ysabel Birkbeck died in 1934. Her husband Henry had died four years before, leaving a huge fortune.

Osferth witnessed royal charters from 898 to 934, as an ealdorman between 926 and 934. In a charter of Edward the Elder he was described as a brother of the king. Therefore, Janet Nelson argues that he was probably an illegitimate son of Alfred. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest that he may have been a relative of Alfred's mother Osburh, or a son of Oswald filius regis (king's son), who may in turn have been a son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor as king, √Üthelred I. Life Osferth is first recorded in the will of Alfred the Great, King of the Anglo-Saxons, which probably dates to the mid-880s.Abels, p. 92; Keynes and Lapidge, p. 313 Alfred bequeathed \\"to my kinsman Osferth\\" estates at Beckley, Rotherfield, Ditchling, Sutton, Lyminster, Angmering and Felpham. Ditchling and Lyminster were substantial royal estates,Keynes and Lapidge, pp. 177, 322‚Äì323 and all the properties are in Sussex. Janet Nelson suggests that they may have been \\"the core of a South Saxon subkingdom\\". The bequest was more generous than that to √Üthelwold, who was the younger son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, √Üthelred, and more compact than that to √Üthelred's elder son, √Üthelhelm. In a royal charter of 898 Osferth witnessed second in the list of ministri (king's thegns).S 350 Alfred died in 899, and in a charter of 901 he witnessed without a title second after King Edward,S 364 and in 903 again without title immediately after Edward's brother √Üthelweard.S 367 In a charter of 904 he witnessed above Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, and next after \\"√Üthelweard filius regis\\" (king's son) as \\"Osferd frater regis\\" (king's brother).S 1286 In a doubtful charter of 909 he is listed straight after Edward's son √Ülfweard as propinquus regis (king's kinsman).S 378 Osferth witnesses as dux (ealdorman) in two dubious charters of 909,S 375 and 376 but there are no surviving charters for the last fifteen years of Edward's reign, and Osferth appears from 926 to 934 at or near the top of lay witnesses as an ealdorman. At an unknown date, probably early in Edward's reign, he was a signatory to the settlement of the dispute outlined in the Fonthill Letter.Whitelock, document 102, p. 503 Nelson comments: \\"Clearly Osferth held an exceptionally prominent position at the courts of three successive kings. It is a sobering thought that none of the narrative sources mention him at all.\\"Nelson, p. 60 Parentage According to Keynes and Lapidge, Osferth was described as Edward's brother \\"mistakenly\\" (in Nelson's view \\"with a briskness worthy of the late Dorothy Whitelock herself\\"). They say: \\"Osferth's relationship to Alfred is uncertain. He may have belonged to his mother Osburh's family, or he may have been a son of the Oswald filius regis who occurs in [royal charters] S 340, 1201 and 1203 and was perhaps a son of Alfred's brother √Üthelred.\\"Keynes and Lapidge, p. 322; Nelson, p. 60 However, in Nelson's view, it is very unlikely that Oswald was √Üthelred's son. She points out that in the introduction to Alfred's will he says that on his succession to the throne there were complaints about his treatment of √Üthelred's sons, \\"the older and the younger\\", meaning √Üthelhelm and √Üthelwold. This suggests that only two sons were alive in 871, but Oswald witnessed in 875. She argues that in view of Osferth's place in Alfred's will and his high position in witness lists in Edward's and √Üthelstan's reigns, he may have been Alfred's illegitimate son. In the ninth century moralists were increasingly condemning sex outside marriage, and Alfred suffered such anxiety over his sexuality that he prayed for an illness that would inhibit lust. Nelson argues that the existence of an illegitimate son would explain the depth of his concern: Asser's failure to mention Osferth in his Life of Alfred is not surprising as he aimed to portray Alfred as a faithful husband.Nelson, pp. 47, 59‚Äì62 In his biography of Alfred, Richard Abels points out that the 'Os-' prefix was common in Alfred's maternal ancestry, and suggests that Osferth belonged to that side of the family, but also mentioned Nelson's view favourably in a footnote.Abels, pp. 48, 97 n.27, 272 Notes Citations Bibliography  880s births 934 deaths 9th-century English people 10th-century English people Anglo-Saxon people House of Wessex ","title":"Osferth"},{"id":"53415299","text":"Cosmin Petri»ôor S√¢rbu (born 29 March 1996) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder or forward for Ripensia Timi»ôoara.CSC S√¢nmartin a pierdut derby-ul cu Recea. bihon.ro Career =Liberty Salonta= S√¢rbu started his career at Liberty Salonta Football Academy.

Long before other publications Uhu showed trends in culture and science that later became manifest, such as the importance of broadcasting and television. Literary talents such as Fritz Kahn, who became famous later with his visualizations of body functions, or the futurist Ludwig Kapeller found their most important publication platform in the magazine. The articles were illustrated with great effort. In the Uhu, among other things, photographs of Erich Salomon were printed, one of the first photographers known to a larger audience. The magazine took an early stand against the national socialists. This was mainly reflected in the form of cartoons such as \\"Hitler receives the Nobel Peace Prize 1932\\".UHU, October 1931, p. 32 The magazine's social focus was occasionally conservative. Hugo Sellheim, the gynecologist, concluded in an article on women and sports that women were able to take personal defeats in competition, which distorted their facial expressions unfavorably; and that women's participation is sports was detrimental to fertility.

It was launched by the Benghazi Defense Brigades on 3 March 2017, and initially resulted in them taking control of a strip of coastal territory between the towns of Nofaliya and Ras Lanuf, which was then handed over to the Government of National Accord. A number of significant oil ports are located in this area, sometimes referred to as the Oil Crescent. The loss of the Oil Crescent was perceived by analysts as a major blow to the power of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar. On 14 March, the LNA recaptured all positions lost to the Benghazi Defence and Misratan Brigades in a counter-offensive after several days of aerial bombardment. Background The oil ports targeted in the offensive had been under the control of the Libyan National Army, which supports the Tobruk-based elected parliament, since September 2016, when they were seized from the Petroleum Facilities Guard. The Benghazi Defense Brigades, an Islamist-dominated militia, had been founded in Spring 2016, by fighters driven from the key eastern city of Benghazi by the Libyan National Army. The BDB is allied with surviving elements of the defeated PFG. Offensive After travelling north through the Sahara Desert from the town of Zella, the BDB simultaneously attacked the ports of Nofaliya, Bin Jawad, Sidra and Ras Lanuf on 3 March. Already overstretched by insurgents in northeastern Cyrenaica, the Libyan Air Force was unable to respond effectively to the BDB's simultaneous attacks. After a short but intense period of fighting, the Libyan National Army withdrew east, leaving the BDB in control of the ports. By 4 March, at least nine people were believed to have been killed in the offensive. Over the following days, air strikes were launched by the Libyan Air Force against the BDB, and as of 7 March, the LNA was reportedly massing forces for a counterattack, to be launched from the town of Brega, possibly with the assistance of the United Arab Emirates. Later that day, however, the BDB announced that it had handed the captured ports over to the Government of National Accord, which responded by dispatching the PFG to the area. Counteroffensive On 9 March, after obtaining endorsement from tribal elders in Benghazi, the LNA launched a counteroffensive in the Oil Crescent, with armoured brigades being sent to the area. The following day, it was reported that airstrikes had targeted Sidra and Ras Lanuf, and that heavy fighting had broken out in Uqayla, a small town located on the frontline. On the night of 11 March, airstrikes conducted by the Dignity Operation warplanes killed two of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) personnel, sources from the PFG reported. On 14 March 2017, LNA have recaptured all positions lost to Benghazi Defence and Misratan Brigades in a counter-offensive after several days of air bombardment. According to local sources, 21 LNA soldiers were killed during the fighting. Meanwhile, LNA spokesman, Ahmed Al-Mismari claimed that remnants of the BDB had fled to Misrata and Jufra. Reactions Since the offensive began, both sides have accused their opponents of deploying mercenaries. As the fighting was taking place, the House of Representatives announced on 7 March that they withdrew their support for the UN-backed peace agreement and the Government of National Accord, and called for new elections to be held by February 2018. This came as the result of the outbreak of conflict between the LNA and the Islamist militias, with the latter being supported by the GNA. The Libyan parliament is opposed to these forces and wants the GNA to condemn their actions. The parliament spokesperson Abdullah Ablaihig stated that \\"the GNA unity government is not legitimate any more, as well as its presidential council and anything to do with this entity.\\"Libya‚Äôs eastern parliament quits UN peace deal with Tripoli Al-Arabiya.

Her parents were Henry Birkbeck, a London-born banker, and Ysabel Birkbeck (n√©e Elwes), a toymaker and philanthropist. Ysabel had a privileged upbringing, which she rejected in favour of art and wartime service during both the First and Second World Wars.  War service  Birkbeck saw very active service in the First World War, driving an ambulance in Russia alongside Elsie Inglis and her field hospital, attached to the First Serbian Division. In December 1915, she was in Russia as part of a solidarity effort by the British government in support of their ally. She ended up in Moldovia, and eventually was part of the Scottish Women's Hospital volunteers who worked to get their equipment across the Danube River near Tulcea with support from the British Armoured Car group. She was on the Romanian front from 1916 to 1917. She was also part of the retreat from Dobruja. During the retreat, Birkbeck and other members of the Scottish Women's Hospital volunteers had nothing more than the clothes they were wearing. In her diaries, she said witnessing the pain of the soldiers being evacuated was one that would stick with her for the rest of her life. During this period, she treated both Serbian and Russian soldiers while being very close to the front lines. At one point, she was caught in the middle of an air raid near Medigidia. The incident resulted in her ambulance getting a flat tire. While she got out to fix it, her three passengers ran for cover. She was trying to return to England in March 1917 while serving as an orderly near Petrograd. While trying to leave, she ended up getting caught in the bread riots. She ended up in part of a group during a general strike that got fired upon by Cossacks and the police. Her hotel was also occupied by the military. She was there when the March 14, 1917 declaration was given by the new government ordering everyone to return to work. Birbeck expressed surprise as the effectiveness of this command. Discussing in her diaries her time stuck in Petrograd, she expressed support for some of the ideas of the revolution as a potential liberalizing force in Russia.  Diaries  Birbeck's diaries were originally written in pencil. Because of the lack of regular access to ink while serving near the front lines, she would explain how she got access to the ink when writing in it. Her diaries were also often written on scraps of paper, pages torn from notebooks and other irregular paper sources. The story of her work driving ambulances can be read in Forgotten Heroines, her published illustrated diary. She recorded how the group of women, who had sailed from Liverpool in late 1916, were known as The Buffs. Mostly young daughters of wealthy families, they cut their hair and wore breeches to face danger and excitement on the Eastern Front. Her diaries also tell the story of Busta House, the home of one of the most prosperous merchants in the Shetland Islands.

It currently hangs in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Bologna.  Painting  This Mannerist painting depicts Laudomia Gozzadini, the painting's commissioner, and her sister Ginevra in the foreground, their father Senator Ulisse Gozzadini seated with them, and their husbands Camillo and Annibale standing behind. Ulisse and Ginevra, who are linked by his hand on her arm, were deceased at the time of the painting. Between her and her late family, Laudomia's hand rests on a dog, a symbol of fidelity, perhaps symbolizing her loyalty to their memory. The two women are dressed in full wedding regalia, Laudomia in a bold red that sets her apart from the other more neutrally attired subjects. Camillo's sword and cross signify his identity as a knight of the Portuguese Order of Christ, while the paper in Annibale's hand may allude to his control over the sisters' finances.  Commission  It is suggested that Laudomia Gozzadini commissioned this portrait as a statement of her legitimacy and patrimonial rights. Correspondence shows that Annibale, the executor of Ulisse's will, owed Laudomia money; over this conflict she took him to court. Painting the sisters in their decadent wedding jewelry, purchased by their father, is interpreted as a reminder that the money they brought with them into their marriages is ultimately of their own inheritance, and not to be withheld from them by their husbands. Compositional support for this theory includes the rendering of the sisters in front of their husbands, taking up much more space, light falling directly onto their faces, while their husbands fade into the dark background.

She began as a beauty vlogger and is now a lifestyle vlogger with a focus on Deaf awareness, accessibility, and the importance of closed captioning.  Background  Poynter was first diagnosed with hearing loss at age 11, genetically inherited from a deaf parent. She describes her deafness as severe in her right ear and moderate to severe in her left ear. She was raised orally under a German deaf mother and an American hearing father in a mainstream environment and attended mainstream schools from K-12, which she described as difficult due to a lack of accommodation. In her early 20s, Poynter became more involved in the Deaf community and began to learn American Sign Language (ASL) in 2015.  YouTube channel  Poynter created her YouTube channel soon after high school when she started uploading makeup tutorials to her YouTube channel RikkiPoynter. She continued creating beauty videos for the next four years, but then decided to use her platform to spread awareness on Deaf issues because she wanted to create content that was beneficial and meaningful. In 2014, Poynter uploaded her first video speaking about her deafness. She rebranded her YouTube channel, which now covers a variety of topics relating to Deaf culture, Deaf issues, closed captioning, and other lifestyle topics. In her videos, Poynter shares her own personal stories about being Deaf. Her videos are described as using humor and snark to highlight challenges facing the deaf/Deaf/Hard of Hearing (d/Deaf/HoH) community and to debunk misconceptions. Her YouTube channel currently has over 85 000 subscribers and a combined video view count of over 5.2 million across almost 450 videos. Her most popular video, \\"Sh*t Hearing People Say (Things You Don't Say to Deaf & Hard of Hearing)\\" has over 500 000 views. Through YouTube and social media, Poynter has been able to find a supportive community that has also helped push for Deaf rights and better closed captioning on YouTube.  Activism  As an online activist, Poynter advocates for improved closed captioning on YouTube, raises awareness against audism, and speaks about challenges that face the d/Deaf/HoH community. She also advocates for the inclusion of intersectionality- specifically in relation to Deafness and disability- in feminism. = Closed captioning awareness = Poynter's main focus is to fight for a higher quantity and quality of closed captioning on YouTube videos. According to Poynter, YouTube's automatically generated closed captions are often inaccurate, do not make sense in the context of the video, and/or contain profanity or inappropriate words. Because of this, Poynter encourages YouTube creators to manually enter their own closed captions. In 2014, Poynter began making videos about this issue and advocating it on her social media platforms. Her goals are to teach YouTubers about the importance of closed captions and to increase the number of creators that caption their content. Her efforts include sending emails and handwritten letters to popular YouTube stars to tell them about the challenges of the lack of captions for the Deaf community on YouTube and to give information on how they can caption their videos. She has also contacted YouTube itself regarding improving their automatic captioning system. Her efforts have attracted attention by mainstream media, including ABC News, BBC News, and Huffington Post. It has also gotten the attention of high-profile YouTubers such as Laci Green, Tyler Oakley, and Tanya Burr. In January 2015, Oakley released a video saying that he has captioned all of his videos and encouraged other YouTubers to do the same, citing Poynter and her video \\"Deaf Accessibility on YouTube\\" as one of the reasons he was motivated to do so. Poynter states that although there is often a lack of response and action from those that she has contacted, Closed captioning awareness is improving. In September 2016, Poynter launched the #NoMoreCraptions campaign to fight against poor closed captioning, including ones that are positioned incorrectly, that lack proper grammar and punctuation, and that include unnecessary comments and/or jokes. The video and campaign explained how to caption videos with Federal Communications Commission guidelines, called on viewers to contact YouTubers they watch to improve or include captions, and invited other YouTubers to make their own #NoMoreCraptions videos. Two days after the campaign began, there were 47 #NoMoreCraptions videos made by other YouTubers in support of the initiative. = Deaf Poynters = Rikki Poynter created a website called 'Deaf Poynters', which is focused on spreading Deaf awareness and advocating for Deaf rights. The website offers information on Deaf culture through articles written by the d/Deaf/HoH community, including personal stories. Other articles posted to the site include history and facts to educate those that are unfamiliar with the background of deafness. The Deaf Poynters website sells merchandise, including stickers, pins, buttons, and prints that include Rikki's commonly used hashtags and slogans such as, #deaftalent, #nomorecraptions, and \\"Do I look deaf now?\\". Through the Deaf Poynters website, viewers have the opportunity to donate to Rikki through platforms including, Patreon, Ko-Fi, and Amazon Wishlist. = Public engagements = In addition to online advocacy, Poynter speaks about Deaf issues and closed captioning at events. At VidCon 2015, Poynter led a workshop called \\"Lights, Camera, Caption!\\" for creators to learn about Deaf culture, the importance of closed captioning, and how to do caption content. In 2016, she led the workshop again, and also participated on the panel Disabilities on YouTube. At Buffer Festival, she was part of the Science and Education panel in 2015, and the Women on YouTube panel in 2016. In 2015, Poynter also gave a talk at Lycoming College about accessibility and deaf issues such as captioning, sign language access and police brutality. = Other involvement = Poynter writes articles for DTV News, a news channel with accessible content for the d/Deaf/HoH community. She is the social media specialist and blogger for Deaf Women in Film, a resource that supports deaf women in the film industry. Poynter also actively supports movements such as #DeafTalent, which aims to acknowledge Deaf individuals working in the media industry and stop the trend of casting hearing actors in Deaf roles. She also contributes video content to Ai-Media, a service that provides access to the world's content through live captioning, closed captions, transcripts and audio description.

He is a theater director, designer, experimental playwright, actor, filmmaker, and the Founding Artistic Director of Monk Parrots, a New York-based multidisciplinary theatre company. Leonard's stage productions have been described as \\"outstanding\\" by The New York Times, and ‚Äúbold and experimental...a clear vision...pure theatrical experience‚Äù by nytheatre.com. He lives in New York.  Life and career  Luke Landric Leonard was born and raised in Houston, Texas where he attended Cypress Creek High School, played football, and acted in school plays. He left the football team after his junior year to become president of Cy Creek's Theatre Department and to focus solely on acting in preparation for college auditions. He studied theatre at Sam Houston State University before moving to New York City in 1995 to enroll in the BFA Acting Program at Brooklyn College where he graduated in 1998. 1996‚Äì2001 Leonard was among the pioneering artists living and working in DUMBO, Brooklyn where he founded DUMBO Theater eXchange a/k/a DTX with Natalie Cook Leonard and Yukihiro Nishiyama. DTX promoted emerging talent by presenting new writers and directors and fostered neighborhood development within the downtown Brooklyn area. DTX; however, did not survive gentrification and the venue was added to the list of artist casualties forced out of DUMBO. On December 15, 2000, a week before Christmas, Leonard and his wife were illegally vacated from their loft on Water Street along with 60 other tenants. DTX presented approximately 30 productions (short and full length) circa 2000‚Äì2001 and hosted all theater events for the 4th Annual DUMBO Arts Festival, produced by Joy Glidden/d.u.m.b.o. arts center (dac). Leonard also studied acting and directing with legendary, experimental director Joseph Chaikin during this time and corresponded with Chaikin by letters until his passing in 2003. 2002‚Äì2004 Michelle Moskowitz-Brown hired Leonard to create a theatre series for a new performance space at Brooklyn Information and Culture called BRIC Studio (now BRIC Arts Media House). Leonard established Theater Nexus, a monthly series devoted to emerging and established theatre artists. After losing the DUMBO space, BRIC became DTX's new home for promoting alternative theatre in NYC. Curated by S. Melinda Dunlap and Leonard, Theater Nexus presented experimental work by numerous artists, such as, 13P, Mac Wellman, Jeffrey M. Jones, Young Jean Lee, Erin Courtney, Ken Rus Schmoll, Connie Congdon, S. Melinda Dunlap, Luke Leonard, David Todd, B. Walker Sampson, Barbara Cassidy, Jonathan Bernstein and Douglas Green, to name a few. In 2003, Leonard became the father of actress Gates Leonard. \\"Third Telling\\", a scene from David Lang and Mac Wellman's \\"The Difficulty of Crossing a Field\\", directed by Luke Leonard 2007‚Äì2010 DTX changed its name to Monk Parrots in 2007 and Leonard was accepted to the highly selective graduate directing program at The University of Texas at Austin where he studied stage direction and studio art and received a Master of Fine Arts in 2010. Leonard was influenced by renowned artists at UT-Austin, such as, Michael Smith, sculptor Margo Sawyer, and playwrights Kirk Lynn and Steven Dietz. In 2009 he worked at Berliner Ensemble for experimental theatre director and visual artist Robert Wilson (director) and directed the Italian Premiere of Israel Horovitz's L'indiano vuole il Bronx (The Indian Wants the Bronx). In 2010 he directed the Texas Premiere of David Lang and Mac Wellman's The Difficulty of Crossing a Field, which was nominated for eight Austin Critics' Table Awards including Best Opera. \\"Second Telling\\", a scene from David Lang and Mac Wellman's \\"The Difficulty of Crossing a Field\\", directed by Luke Leonard 2010‚Äì2012 Leonard returned to New York to resume his role as Artistic Director of Monk Parrots and began building a new body of performance work. His concept-driven approach explores the possibilities of theatre and with his company he began to hone an \\"edgy choreographed directorial style\\" Luke Leonard/Monk Parrots made Here I Go with playwright David Todd; a theatrical portrait of a Texan housewife in her 60s contemplating suicide inspired by the death of Leonard's grandmother. It was presented at 59E59 Theaters from May 22, 2012 to June 3, 2012. Leonard created the main character, Lynette, her circumstances and a performance structure, then asked Todd to write six monologues that Monk Parrots could arrange during rehearsals. The staging was created first with five, nonspeaking actors, then a prerecorded voice of Lynette was added to the actors' movements; blurring the lines between dance and theatre. Reviewer David Roberts described Here I Go as \\"a brilliantly conceived and executed performance work that truly crosses artistic boundaries.\\" 2012‚Äì2014 Over brunch in New York, playwright Kirk Lynn asked Leonard what he was working on. Leonard handed him a copy of coaching legend Bum Phillips' autobiography and said he wanted to make an 'opera' based on Phillips' life. Lynn smiled and Leonard asked if he would read the book and consider writing the libretto. Later, Lynn agreed to create the libretto under the following condition, that Peter Stopschinski compose the score. Former Monk Parrots board member, Steven Beede, Esq., initiated a call for Leonard to speak with Bum and Debbie Phillips. When asked how they felt about an opera based on Bum's life, Bum Phillips replied, \\"I can't sing a lick!\\" They arranged to meet in person, then Leonard, Stopschinski, and Leonard's parents traveled to the Phillips' ranch in Goliad, Texas to discuss the performance rights. Upon arrival, Leonard shook hands with Bum Phillips and said, \\"Mr. Phillips, it's a pleasure to meet you.\\" Phillips replied, \\"It's a pleasure to want to be met at 89.\\" They ate Subway sandwiches, baked beans, and pecan pie and Leonard and Stopschinski left with the Phillips' blessing to make the opera. The world premiere of Bum Phillips Opera was presented in the Ellen Stewart Theatre at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York from March 12, 2014 to March 30, 2014. It was attended by Bum Phillips‚Äô son, coach Wade Phillips, former NFL players, Dan Pastorini and Larry Harris, and featured on the nationally televised program NFL Films Presents produced by NFL Films. Wade Phillips commented, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great tribute for us and our family. There‚Äôs not many people that get an opera, Don Giovanni and the Barber of Seville.‚Äù Dan Pastorini said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs face it, Bum Phillips and opera don't belong in the same sentence,\\" but admitted that he had tears running down his face by the end. After seeing the New York premiere, Pastorini made it a mission to bring the opera to Houston, which he did in September 2015. The Texas Premiere was presented at The Stafford Centre on September 24, 2015 and attended by Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell and Luv Ya Blue Houston Oilers, Mike Barber, Vernon Perry, Billy Johnson, Mike Renfro, and many more. 2015‚Äì2016 The Australian company Gertrude Opera discovered Leonard's work and hired him as Resident International Stage Director for The Opera Studio Melbourne. He directed and designed the Australian Premiere of The Difficulty of Crossing a Field to critical acclaim for the inaugural Nagambie Lakes Opera Festival, and he directed and designed the World Premiere of The Scottish Opera, an 80-minute reimagining of Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth, arranged by composer Peter Stopschinski for an eight piece orchestra with electric instruments, which premiered at the 2nd Annual Nagambie Lakes Opera Festival.

The lawyers argued that the Bari contract and aborted July loan to Pistoiese should not count as Bari went bankrupt soon after, making the player a free agent, but the league rejected that argument and Scalera had to return to Pescara. On 1 August 2019, he signed with Viterbese.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three red, yellow and white flowers, although the relative amount of each of these colours is variable.labellum detail  Description  Caladenia pulchra is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. Up to three flowers long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers have varying amounts of red, white and yellow and are sometimes all red. The sepals have long, brown, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals have about the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal but they are held horizontally near their bases, then turn downwards and droop. The labellum is long, wide and cream-coloured with red lines and marks. The sides of the labellum have short, blunt teeth, the tip is curled under and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to early October but generally only occurs after good rainfall.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia pulchra was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected near Jerramungup and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (pulchra) is a Latin word meaning \\"beautiful\\" referring to the delicate flowers of this orchid.  Distribution and habitat  The slender spider orchid is found between Jerramungup and Pithara in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows under dense sheoak and similar trees near temporary streams.

The personnel started in Camiers at General Hospital No. 11 in June 1917 and then moved to General Hospital No. 13, at Boulogne-sur-Mer to finish out the war. In The United States Many Americans began preparing for the entry into the First World War prior to the country's formal engagement in hostilities, notably in the formation of hospitals under the auspices of the Red Cross. Col. J.R. Kean visited Boston in February 1916 and proposed that three hospitals be organized around the three major hospitals of the city: Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston City Hospital, and Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women's Hospital) connected to Harvard University. The university had begun making its own plans, and a compromise was reached where the medical school as a whole would form a unity, not just the Brigham alone. Col. Jacob Peabody of the local Red Cross chapter began a campaign to raise the $25,000 ($ in ) worth of equipment required for a 500-bed hospital. A large part of the supply requirements were met through the New England Surgical Dressings Committee. The Committee organized dressings which were then sterilized and packed into sealed tins to be distributed in France through the American Clearing House. While the funds were raised and supplies and equipment purchased, they were not shipped with the hospital when it went overseas, believing materials would be in abundance there, instead, these supplies would be sent to help care for the victims of the Halifax Explosion. While many were eager, it was difficult to secure all the personnel for the hospital before war was declared. Once the United States‚Äô position was clear many hurried to join, because medical service would be the quickest way to France. Base Hospital No.5 was organized in February 1916 and mobilized in May 1917, stopping at Fort Totten, before boarding the RMS Saxonia for Falmouth, England. It was the second hospital unit to leave for Europe after the first, No. 4. The hospital personnel were some of the only passengers on the ship, which was carrying munitions. At this time, there was no convoy in place, and while they did not encounter any enemy submarines they sailed through wreckage and remained on high alert until their arrival in England. After a brief stay in England, the unit made their way to France. In Camiers Base Hospital No. 5 took over the operations of the BEF General Hospital No. 11, situated between Dannes and Camiers in Pas de Calais. The previous hospital staff had dealt with the poorly drained site through the intense influx of wounded from the Battle of the Somme, treating 8000 severely wounded and were now completely exhausted. The Harvard team undertook to clean up the site and fix the drainage, but it was not possible to correct the problem completely. In addition to drainage, there was a significant rat population, which was dealt with by obtaining some ferrets. Beyond the physical state of the site, the American forces found themselves underequipped and understaffed for a hospital of this size. Though they requested more additional support from the War Department, it took six months to be filled and only a fraction of the personnel were granted due to other needs elsewhere. As a result, they retained approximately 225 British personnel to adequately care for the wounded. The drainage and vermin were not the only hazards of the site, located next to cement works and not far from a munitions dump, the area was under regular threat from German bombers. On 4 September 1917, one Gotha bomber dropped seven bombs, five of which were direct hits on the hospital. Lt. William Fitzsimmons, Pte. Rudolph Rubio, Pte. Oscar Tugo, and Pte. Leslie Woods were all killed in the bombing. Lt. Rae Whidden was injured and invalided home, but ultimately died of pneumonia following influenza later in the month. In addition, Lt. Clarence McGuire, Pte. Aubrey McLeod, Nurse Eva Parmelee, Lt. Thaddeus Smith, and twenty-two patients were seriously wounded in the attack. These were the first AEF casualties of the war. In the six months Base Hospital No. 5 was stationed in Camiers they treated over 15,000 cases and 3000 in June 1917 alone. In October 1917, it was determined that the operation would move to Bolougne-sur-Mer to take over for General Hospital No. 13. In Bolougne-sur-Mer On 1 November 1917, Base Camp Hospital No. 5 took over the BEF hospital that had been operating out of the casino in Boulogne-sur-Mer. In this location, so close to England, they provided temporary care, food, and beds for those waiting to be transported home, as well as their usual duties. The threat of air raids continued at their new site, and the casino was an especially easy target. On 22 December 1917, bombers hit the medical stores, the base's bakery and other sites, killing 52 people and wounding 172. This constant threat added to the great relief felt by the personnel when leave was granted after nine months of work. The transition to General Hospital No. 13 also marked changes in staff. Around this time other American units were arriving, and many of the senior medical staff were in high demand for training or for detached units. Maj. Harvey Cushing, Cpt. Elliott Cutler, Cpt. Samuel Harvey and Lt. William Terhune were all transferred to AEF hospitals to help train them as they arrived. Head Nurse Carrie Hall was called up to be the chief nurse for the American Red Cross for Great Britain in May 1918 and was succeeded by Rose Butler at the hospital. A number of other staff were detached to Mobile Hospital No. 6, which was set up in Deuxnouds-aux-Bois for the Meuse-Argonne offensive. General Hospital No. 13 was considerably smaller than No. 11, but with the arrival of AEF forces, it meant for the first time they were often treating American casualties. First, a large influx of wounded from the 33rd American Division who had been at the Somme. And soon after, when the British began their final assault on the Montdidier area in early August 1918. From them until the end of the war, they saw a heavy succession of casualties from those of the 27th and 30th Infantry Divisions fighting at Kemmelberg and Messines Ridge on the Hindenburg Line with the British, and from the 37th and 91st serving with the French in Belgium. Even after the armistice was declared, sick and wounded continued to arrive from forward hospitals through November and December. Finally, at the beginning of February 1919, the hospital stopped taking patients. In the twenty months of active service, Base Hospital No. 5 treated over 45,837 patients, both surgical and medical (41,015 were British and 4,822 Americans). The record number of patients treated in one day was 964. Many of these included those suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic. Numbers of fatalities were kept to a minimum through the careful study and experiments of Cpts. A.V. Bock, and G.P. Denny, with the vigilant attention of the nurses in the quarantine wards: Eva Clements, Ruth Conklin, Mary Cummings, Gertrude Gerrard, Margaret Leavitt, Edna Moir, and Eva Parmelee. The highest number of casualties the hospital received in one day was 964. On 6 April 1919, the enlisted men boarded the SS Graf Waldersee and sailed for New York. They remained at Camp Merritt for six days before arriving at Camp Devens to be demobilized between 29 April and 2 May 1919. The Vanguard The unit organized a variety of entertainments including variety shows and, while in Camiers, a baseball league with the nearby Canadian No. 1 and No. 3, and Chicago Units.

Critical reception  Sub Rosa had a positive reception from literary critics upon its debut. The Globe and Mail‚Äôs Jim Bartley remarked on how Dawn manages to subvert expectations in the development of her novel, addressing significant issues revolving around gender, sexuality, and human rights. Later in the year, the novel was also selected by Bartley as one of the ‚ÄúTop 5 Novels of the Year.‚Äù Both Bartley and David Chau from The Georgia Straight similarly positively commented on Dawn's approach to imagination and memory as a means of achieving redemption in the novel. Sarah Pinder from The Broken Pencil magazine stated that despite being non-exhaustive in its representations of sex workers, Sub Rosa \\"definitely fills a void,\\" as it \\"highlights sex workers as powerful protagonists, rather than as sideline characters or background images.\\" Jean Roberta from The Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide likewise noted the novel's treatment of sex workers, commenting on how the novel's genre itself appears unfixed and how it can be perceived as either a utopia or a dystopia.  Awards  Dawn won the Dayne Ogilvie Prize in 2012. The award, presented by the Writers' Trust of Canada, was established in 2007 in the memory of Dayne Ogilvie. It is a $4000 unique prize given to emerging LGBT Canadian writers. The award is presented to the author as a general achievement award rather than for a specific work, but the jury specifically singled out Sub Rosa in their judging, saying, \\"Amber Dawn is an impressive, heart-stopping talent. Her debut novel, Sub Rosa, is a clear-eyed myth exploring the lives of young women at risk. Both fearless in its narrative and rich in its landscape of metaphor, Sub Rosa is a book that refuses to be overlooked. Dawn‚Äôs story is not just an attempt to hold the world‚Äôs darkness, but to find it some comfort too.\\" Sub Rosa was also presented the Lambda Award in 2011, in the ‚ÄúLesbian Debut Fiction‚Äù category. It was the 23rd year of the awards. The Lambda awards are given to a novel that best represents and celebrates the LGBT community in that past year as chosen by a jury. The awards were established in 1989 and are based in the United States. In her acceptance speech, Amber Dawn was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúMay magic and a brazen imagination be a way we continue to tell our stories‚Äù.

Josh continues to be a mainstay on many all-time statistical categories, including 1st in single season saves, 2nd in career saves, 4th in single season strikeouts, 4th in career strikeouts. =Rockhurst University (2012-2014)= In 2012 Tols transferred to continue his college career at Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri. in his first year, he pitch for a record of 6-2 with a 3.36 ERA. He held opposition batters to a .247 batting average, stuck out 66 batters over 67 innings pitched, and recorded four complete games and two shutouts. He was recognised as a member of the All-Great Lakes Valley Conference team. He redshirted in 2013 due to a shoulder injury. In 2014, as a pitcher he recorded 4-7 (win-loss) with a 2.60 ERA and struck out 71 in 69 1/3 IP. He led the GLVC in strike outs and was second-team All-Conference. =Independent Leagues (2014-2016)= He began his pro career with the Las Vegas Train Robbers then moved to the Trinidad Triggers, both of the Pecos League. He finished the summer at 5-0, 3.28 with 61 K in 60 1/3 IP. He also hit for a batting average of .269 on base percentage .345 and slugging .308 from 31 plate appearances. In 2015 Tols signed with the Kansas City T-Bones in the American Association where he went 2-0 with a 4.55 ERA with 49 strike outs over 55.1 innings pitched. In 2016 Tols returned for his final season with the T-Bones where he went 5-4 with a 4.18 ERA with 60 strike outs over 60.1 innings pitched. =Australian Baseball (2010-)= Tols made his Australian Baseball League debut in 2010 as a 20-year-old. He pitched 2 1/3 shutout innings for his hometown Adelaide Bite in the 2010-2011 Australian Baseball League (3 H, 1 BB, 1 K). With Adelaide for the first time in four winters, Josh went 9-2 with a 2.38 ERA and 46 K in 34 IP as a reliever. He led the league in wins (two over Scott Mitchinson and Morgan Coombs) and tied for third with 22 games pitched. He was named the ABL Rookie of the Year and Reliever of the Year, and selected in the Australian team for the Australian Baseball League All-Star Game. In 2015-2016, he remained hot for Adelaide (4-1, Sv, 2.23, .200 opponent average). He was 4th in the ABL in ERA (between Scott Mitchinson and Edwin Carl). Josh was signed to play for the Melbourne Aces in 2016 where he posted a 3-2 (win-loss), 2 save, 0.92 ERA season with 42 strike outs over 29.2 innings pitched. After moving to Melbourne Josh also joined the Fitzroy Baseball Club in Division one of the Victorian Summer Baseball League. In his debut season Josh won the Harry Douglas trophy for the league's best pitcher,http://vicsummerleague.baseball.com.au/Competition/Previous- Winners/Pitching-Awards with an ERA of 0.20 https://www.facebook.com/VicSummerLeague/photos/a.1161209987283158/1404398802964274/?type=3&theater; helping Fitzroy to win the league's club championship.http://vicsummerleague.baseball.com.au/Competition/Previous- Winners/Club-Champions Returning to the Aces Josh increased his workload with 5-3, 1 save, 4.78 ERA season with 75 strike outs over 52.2 innings pitched. Tols was selected as a member of the Australian national baseball team at the 2017 World Baseball Classic and signed by the Philadelphia Phillies organisation. Following his signing by the Phillies Josh was restricted to a light workload in the 2017/18 ABL season pitching only 8 innings over 4 games with the Aces. He had a 1.18 ERA, with 1 win and 9 strike outs. =Minor leagues (2018‚Äìpresent)= Tols signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on February 9, 2018. He was assigned to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League to begin the season. Through 4 appearances, including 1 start, he had struck out 13 batters while allowing only 2 hits and posting an ERA of 0.93. He was then promoted to the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League. He still primarily served as a relief pitcher and accumulated 42 strikeouts and a 3.27 ERA by the season's end. Cumulatively, his first season record stood at 2‚Äì1 with a 2.74 ERA over 42 innings with 55 strikeouts. For the 2019 campaign, Tols was promoted to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the International League. Coming on exclusively in relief, he retired 39 batters on strikes and had a 1‚Äì1 record with a 3.84 ERA in . International career Tols was selected for the Australian national baseball team at the 2017 World Baseball Classic and 2019 WBSC Premier12.

Biography May was born in Montgomery, Alabama, one of a family of eight. His father died when he was a child, and, while his mother worked in menial jobs, Butler May developed his musical talents, singing and playing piano. By the age of fourteen he had become an accomplished performer, and he joined Will Benbow's \\"Chocolate Drops Company\\" on the vaudeville touring circuit. Based in Pensacola, Florida, the troupe also included Jelly Roll Morton and Ma Rainey. William Benbow: WWI Draft Registration Card, DoctorJazz.co.uk. Retrieved 7 March 2017 When interviewed by Alan Lomax in 1938, Morton recalled May as \\"the greatest comedian [he] ever knew\\", describing him as \\"a very, very swell fellow, over six feet tall, very slender with big liver lips, and light complexioned. His shoes were enormous and he wore trousers impossible to get over his feet without a shoe horn. He always had a big diamond in his front tooth.

Retrieved 7 March 2017 In 1909, May appeared as half of a double act with comedian Kid Kelly in Atlanta, and acquired the stage name \\"String Beans\\" (or \\"Stringbeans\\") for his lanky appearance. The following year, he formed a personal and professional relationship with New Orleans-born Sweetie Matthews. They married, and performed regularly together in Benbow's company. In 1911, they played in Chicago at the Monogram theater, one of the top black vaudeville venues in the city, and, according to writers Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff, \\"opened the floodgates for other Southern acts, and ensured a prominent place for the blues in American entertainment.\\" In one of his most popular songs, \\"Titanic Blues\\", Stringbeans sang that he survived the catastrophe because of his athleticism. He originated the much-copied blues metaphor of \\"Elgin movements\\", and was known as \\"The Elgin Movements Man\\". He was known for his originality in composition and performance, and his improvisational skills with lyrics. However, one newspaper critic, Perry Bradford in Atlanta, claimed that Stringbeans' act was \\"the smuttiest in the business\\". Writer W. L. James, who saw Stringbeans perform around 1914, said of him: > As he attacks the piano, Stringbean‚Äôs head starts to nod, his shoulders > shake, and his body begins to quiver. Slowly, he sinks to the floor of the > stage. Before he submerges, he is executing the Snake Hips‚Ä¶, shouting the > blues and, as he hits the deck still playing the piano, performing a > horizontal grind which would make today‚Äôs rock and roll dancers seem like > staid citizens. Although their relationship was punctuated by occasional acrimonious separations during which May performed with other partners, Stringbeans and Sweetie toured together intermittently until the end of 1915. Earlier that year, they debuted in New York City, at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem, later returning for an unprecedented three-week engagement there. As a husband and wife team, they directly inspired Butterbeans and Susie, and May was also credited as an inspiration by Ethel Waters. In February 1916, May formed a new act with Benbow, initially as a four-piece with singers Robbie Lee Peoples and Ebbie Burton, but soon expanding into the \\"Beans and Benbow's Big Vaudeville Review\\", with fifteen performers. May was called by one critic \\"the blues master piano player of the world.... Much of his present popularity is due to his oddities, his eccentricities, differing wholly from anything ever seen on a public stage.... His strange comedy and blues, especially when at the piano, create a furor.\\" After the Review broke up in early 1917, May continued touring as a solo act, before joining \\"C.W. Park‚Äôs Colored Aristocrats\\", another review managed by Benbow. However, he soon left, and teamed up with the pairing of Butterbeans and Susie in a new act. May died in November 1917, in Jacksonville, Florida, from a broken neck. It is believed that his death was the result of a botched initiation ceremony at a Freemasonry lodge, after a rope was put round his neck. He was paralyzed and died a week later.

Moenomycin A is the founding member of the antibiotic family with the majority discovered by the end of the late 1970s.Wallhausser, K.H., et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1965. P. 734-736. Structure Structures of notable members of the moenomycin family of antibiotics The moenomycins can be reduced to three key structural featuresWalker, S., Ostash, B.O., Moenomycin Biosynthesis-related Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof . U.S. Patent 9115358 B2, Aug 25, 2015. # A central 3-phosphoglyceric acid backbone. # A 25-carbon isoprenoid chain connected by an ether linkage to the C2-position of 3-phosphoglyceric acid. # A substituted tetrasaccharide tethered via a phosphodiester linkage to 3-phosphoglyceric acid. It is the combination of different isoprenoid chains and variously substituted tetrasaccharides that give rise to the diversity of the moenomycin family.Welzel, P. Chem. Rev. 2005, 105, 4610‚àí4660 Based on degradation experiments, the defining mark of a moenomycin is the presence of the 25-carbon alcohol moenocinol or diumycinol upon hydrolysis of the lipid tail; these alcohols originate from the L1 or L2 lipid respectively in the figure.Adachi, M., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2006, 128 (43), pp 14012‚Äì14013 These two structures are the only observed lipid tails within the moenomycin family, with AC326-Œ± being the only known for producing diumycinol. With regards to the tetrasaccharide portion, stereochemistry and functionality can differ at R1 and R2 depending on if this saccharide unit is D-gluco versus D-galacto; there is an axial methyl group in the former case with the exception of moenomycin A12 and C1 where there is instead an axial hydroxyl. The oligosaccharide motif can be deoxygenated, hydroxylated, or glycosylated at the R3 position ‚Äì notable examples of the pentasaccharide motif include moenomycin A and AC326-Œ±. It is believed the additional glycan can enhance specificity and binding to the target protein, affording increased activity.Yuan, Y. ACS Chem. Biol., 2008, 3 (7), pp 429‚Äì436 With the exception of pholipomycin and AC326-Œ±, the R4 saccharide unit is usually the deoxysaccharide. Lastly, in the majority of moenomycins the R5 position is linked to a 2-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dione ‚Äì a convenient chromophore utilized for structural analysis. For the nosokomycin subfamily, this position forms a carboxamide or carboxylic acid.Ostash, B.; Walker, S. Nat. Prod. Rep., 2010, 27, 1594-1617Schacht U, Huber G J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1969 Dec; 22(12):597-602. Chemical synthesis Due to the structural complexity of the moenomycins, total synthesis has proved difficult, with only one total synthesis reported so far. Some of the largest challenges include fashioning the glycosidic linkages with stereochemical control and site-specifically decorating the oligosaccharide with pendant functionality. Understanding that the majority of variation within the moenomycin family derives from differences within the oligosaccharide unit, Kahne and lab has designed an efficient and flexible total synthesis of moenomycin A that gives access to analogues as well as other members of the moenomycin family.Kahne, D.E., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2006, 128 (47), pp 15084‚Äì15085 Biosynthesis Biosynthetic mechanism for the moenocinol lipid tail of moenomycin A. From farnesyl derivative and geranyl pyrophosphate: 1. Cyclization and pyrophosphate elimination 2. Ring expansion 3. Base catalyzed ring opening Extensive exploration into the biosynthesis of the moenomycin family has been conducted to better inform the genetic engineering and biosynthesis of novel moenomycin analogues. Early work on the biosynthesis of the moenomycins focused on the 25-carbon lipid tail derived from moenocinol; the tail was of particular interest given that it appears to break the isoprene rule at C8, containing a quaternary carbon. Feeding studies revealed the moenocinol lipid tail originates from a 15-carbon farnesyl precursor and a 10-carbon geranyl pyrophosphate.Arigoni, D., et al. Tetrahedron Letters, 2001, 42, 3835‚Äì37 More recently, the biosynthetic gene cluster for moenomycin A was first described in 2007 in Streptomyces ghanaensis.Ostash B., et al. Chem Biol. 2007, 14, 257-67. In 2009, the seventeen step biosynthetic pathway was completely characterized, revealing the order of assembly for the molecular scaffold.Ostash, B., et al. Biochemistry 2009, 48, 8830‚Äì41. Medicinal use The moenomycins target bacterial peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases, inhibiting cell wall formation, leading to cell death.Gampe, C. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013, 135 (10), pp 3776‚Äì3779 In general, the antibiotics are particularly potent against gram- positive bacteria with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 1‚Äì100 (ng/ml). At higher concentrations the moenomycins are also effective against gram-negative bacteria with an MIC between 0.3‚Äì150 (Œºg/ml). In vivo studies using mice models suggest the antibiotics are powerful prophylactic and therapeutic agents, with subcutaneous injection being the most effective mode of delivery.Huber G. In: Antibiotics. Hahn FE, editor. Springer-Verlag; Berlin/Heidelberg: 1979. pp. 135‚Äì153. Moenomycins A and C are commercially used in the formulation of Bambermycins (Flavomycin), a veterinary antibiotic used solely in poultry, swine, and cattle feed.National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem Compound Database; CID=53385491, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/53385491 (accessed Mar. 8, 2017). Due to poor pharmacokinetic properties from the 25-carbon lipid chain, the moenomycins are not used in humans. The pharmacophore is well understood however, allowing the moenomycins to serve as the blueprint for future antibacterials. Mode of action =General= The moenomycin family functions as an antibiotic by reversibly binding bacterial transglycosylases, essential enzymes that catalyze the extension of the glycan chain of the cell wall to form a stable peptidoglycan layer. The moenomycins mimic and thus compete with the natural substrate of the enzyme, inhibiting growth of the cell wall. Compromise of the wall results in leakage of cell contents, and ultimately cell death. The moenomycins are the only known active site inhibitors of these enzymes, which in lies their promise as human antibiotics given pathogenic bacteria have not yet widely evolved resistance.Walsh, C.T., The Journal of Antibiotics (2014) 67, 7‚Äì22 =Structure-activity relationships= The 25-carbon lipid tail confers to the moenomycins a detergent-like property that allows them to become incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane of the target bacterial cell. This anchoring presents the oligosaccharide portion of the molecule to the transglycosylase where it can tightly and selectively bind the enzyme, inhibiting cell wall growth.Volke, F. Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 85 (1997) 115‚Äì123. This property however undermines their use in clinical settings. The amphiphilic nature of the moenomycins induce hemolytic activity, provide a long half-life in the blood stream, and creates a tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. Comparison of moenomycins with an abridged isoprene chain of 10-carbons, show that the oligosaccharide can still tightly bind the enzyme active site, but in vivo the MIC significantly increases since the drug is unable to anchor itself to the cytoplasmic membrane and present its sugar moiety. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal length for favorable pharmacokinetic properties.Anikin, A., et al. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 1999 Dec 16; 38(24):3703-3707. In contrast to the lipid portion, the oligosaccharide portion of the moenomycins is relatively well understood. When absent, the chromophore portion can decrease activity by 10-fold, suggesting it is not necessary for recognition but provides additional contacts with the target enzyme.T.

He played college football at Ashland, and was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He is the highest draft pick from Ashland in the modern era of the NFL. Early years Shaheen attended Big Walnut High School in Sunbury, Ohio. He played football and basketball in high school. College career Shaheen played one year of college basketball at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. In 2014, he transferred to Ashland University and joined the football team as a walk-on. During his career, he had 129 receptions for 1,755 yards and 26 touchdowns. After the 2016 season, Shaheen decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Professional career =Pre-draft= On January 5, 2017, it was announced that Shaheen would forgo his senior season and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. At the time of the announcement, he was ranked the 12th best tight end prospect in the draft by CBS Sports and NFLDraftScout.com. Shaheen was one of 19 tight ends invited to the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He fared well in the combine drills and tied Oregon's Pharaoh Brown for first in the bench press with 24 reps. Shaheen had his best performance during positional drills, showing his agility and receiving ability. He received a boost in his draft stock after he impressed scouts and team representatives with his performance in the positional drills. Prior to the combine, Shaheen was a relatively unknown prospect out of Division II Ashland University. He received media attention after an interview at the combine where he was asked by a reporter how he gained 70 lbs. during college, with Shaheen responding, \\"Um, a lot of Chipotle burritos.\\" He went on to reiterate, \\"In all honesty, it was a lot of burritos.\\" The quote and story went on to be posted on websites by the Bleacher Report, New York Daily News, USA Today, and ESPN, with the New England Patriots' website donning him the \\"Chipotle Prospect\\". On March 22, 2017, Shaheen opted to participate at Ashland's Pro Day and chose to only run positional drills. Scouts and team representatives from 16 NFL teams attended, including tight end coaches from the Pittsburgh Steelers, Chicago Bears, New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders, and Detroit Lions. Shaheen had multiple visits and private workouts with NFL teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Browns, Tennessee Titans, Arizona Cardinals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Dallas Cowboys. The majority of NFL draft experts and analysts projected him to be a second round pick. He was ranked the fourth best tight end prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com and NFL analyst Mike Mayock and was ranked the fifth best tight end by ESPN. =Chicago Bears= The Chicago Bears selected Shaheen in the second round with the 45th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. The Chicago Bears originally owned the 36th overall pick in the second round, but opted to trade the selection with their seventh round pick (221st overall) to the Arizona Cardinals and acquired their second round (45th), fourth round (119th overall), and sixth round picks (197th overall). Shaheen is the highest player to be selected from Ashland University. He joins Jeris Pendleton (2012), Bill Overmyer (1972), and Len Pettigrew (1971) as the only players to be drafted from Ashland. 2017 On May 19, 2017, the Chicago Bears signed Shaheen to a four-year, $5.91 million contract with $3.17 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.43 million. Throughout training camp, Shaheen competed against Daniel Brown and Ben Braunecker for the job as the third tight end on the depth chart. Head coach John Fox named Shaheen the third tight end on the Bears' depth chart to begin the regular season, behind veterans Zach Miller and Dion Sims. He made his professional regular season debut in the Chicago Bears' season-opening 23‚Äì17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. On September 24, 2017, Shaheen made his first career start and caught the first pass of his career on a two-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Mike Glennon during their 23‚Äì17 overtime victory. His first career touchdown reception came in the second quarter as Shaheen was left wide open on a blown coverage by the Steelers. Throughout the first seven regular season games, Shaheen was predominantly used as a blocking tight end in two and three tight end sets. During a Week 8 matchup against the New Orleans Saints, starting tight end Zach Miller suffered a dislocated knee and tore his popliteal artery. Miller was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season and Shaheen became the second starting tight end, along with Dion Sims.

As with the other six paintings in the series, it focuses on the disembodied head of male figure, who looks out with a penetrating gaze, but is fixed against an isolating, flat, nondescript background, while also enfolded by hazy horizontal foreground curtain-like folds which seems to function like a surrounding cage.Davies; Yard, 19 Head III was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover in a showing commissioned by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen.Zweite, 74 They six head paintings were painted during a short period of time, when Bacon was under pressure to provide works for the Hanover exhibition. Of the series, Head I, Head II, and Head VI are today seen as artistically successful, with Head VI as ground breaking, and a direct precursor to Bacon's seminal 1950's many representations of Popes. Head III is important in the development in that it is the first of the series in which Bacon masters the effect of the horizontal folds, and the ambiguous facial expression of the subject nears that of his Diego Vel√°zquez's Portrait of Innocent X; his primary source for these paintings.Davies; Yard, 19 The painting is in a private collection, having been sold at auction at Sotheby's in 2013 for ¬£10,442,500.Francis Bacon, Head III, Sotheby's, 26 June 2013 Description Image from Battleship Potemkin (1925) The painting measures .Head III, 1949, artimage.org.uk Perhaps a portrait of Bacon's lover Eric Hall, the grisaille work depicts a bald man's head with pock-marked discolored off-white face, partially concealed by diaphanous curtains. The face has an enigmatic expression, with his cold eyes - emphasised by bright marks of zinc white - looking out through broken pince-nez spectacles. This is the first occasion when the motif of broken glasses appears in Bacon's work, inspired by the image of an injured nurse in the 1925 film Battleship Potemkin.

Import mechanisms People might have drugs shipped to them from online pharmacies. They may travel internationally for the purpose of medical tourism, and purchase drugs there to be used back home. Causes Individual consumers will only consider seeking drugs from other countries if they have some barrier to access in their own country. One barrier to access is high local prices compared to other markets. Another barrier to access could be legal restrictions preventing an individual from getting a drug they want or need. =International drug market prices= In some markets, drug prices are set or influenced by the prices in other, nearby markets. In Europe, for example, people freely and easily travel to different countries, and the price of a certain drug in one country affects the price in other, nearby countries. Having this kind of competitive exchange can keep prices low, but it can also lead to lowered drug accessibility. Sometimes a manufacturer may choose not to offer a drug in one market, to ensure success in selling the drug at a higher price in a different market. Businesses, manufacturers and drug retailers wish to control the supply of pharmaceuticals in their own marketplace. As such, if low-cost drugs entered a market from other lower-cost territories, what might develop is pure price-based selling. The TRIPS agreement is an example of a World Trade Organization treaty which regulates how drugs can be traded in the international marketplace. Some developing countries might receive access to lower-cost drugs through compulsory licenses. Compulsory licenses affect markets outside the country in which they are issued. =Variation in legality= Drugs which are legal in one place may not be legal in another. By region =Canada to United States= People in the United States have easy access to Canada. The quality of medicine in Canada is comparable to that of the United States. Drug prices are often much lower in Canada than in the United States. To save money, some consumers in the United States seek to purchase drugs in Canada. Different people have published different perspectives on this practice. One major on-line supplier, Canada Drugs, announced its closure on July 13, 2018 as part of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Two organizations, the Canadian International Pharmacy Association and the PharmacyChecker Verification Program, verify the safety and legitimacy of online pharmacies that ship from Canada to the United States. Society and culture =Petition for government reform= Consumers may feel that prescription drugs which are available to multiple countries to be of equivalent quality, and feel comfortable buying and using drugs by choosing to purchase from the country which offers the drugs at the lowest price. =Legal status= Governments typically oversee the import of prescription drugs so bringing a prescription drug from a foreign country could be Illegal drug trade.

Through her writing and painting, she portrayed the world in which she lived and the restrictions placed upon her life. Founding several cultural and feminist clubs, Weber successfully navigated the Trujillo years, helping to gain both civil and political rights for women. Early life Delia Mercedes Weber P√©rez was born on 23 October 1900 in the Santa B√°rbara neighborhood of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic to Dominican, Enriqueta P√©rez and Cura√ßaoan, Juan Esteban Weber Suli√© (also known as Johann Stephan Weber). Her father was a goldsmith who had immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Cura√ßao. Her paternal grandfather, Alfred von Weber, whose ancestry traced to Dresden, was a musician who had immigrated from Amsterdam to the Caribbean and married Pauline Suli√©, a native Cura√ßaoan woman. When she was twelve years old, Weber entered the Liceo N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres, graduating from her higher primary studies in 1914. She began studying art in 1917, at the Academia de Dibujo, Pintura y Escultura (Academy of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture), under the tutelage of Abelardo Rodr√≠guez Urdaneta and the following year entered the Instituto de Se√±oritas \\"Salom√© Ure√±a\\". She would graduate from this school with a bachelor's degree in natural sciences and later complete the institution's normal school. She also studied art with Adolfo Obreg√≥n and Celeste Woss y Gil Career In 1918, Weber began publishing poems in the magazine, F√©mina and soon began serving on the editorial board of the paper, the first feminist newspaper in the country directed by Petronila Ang√©lica G√≥mez. When she finished her education, Weber began teaching art at various schools in Santo Domingo including, the Escuela Normal de Varones de Santo Domingo, the Instituto de Se√±oritas Salom√© Ure√±a, and the Liceo Juan Pablo Duarte. In 1923, she joined the first feminist organization in the country, also founded by G√≥mez, Central Committee of Dominican Feminists (), the local arm of the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women (). These early feminist groups were part of the nationalist movement in opposition to the U.S. occupation. Weber wrote articles which were published in Democracia of Puerto Rico, El Ateneo from Honduras, El Diario of Medell√≠n, M√©xico Moderno in Mexico City, Proa from Argentina and others. In 1923, Weber appeared in the film, Las emboscadas de Cupido the second film made by Francisco Arturo Palau, pioneer of Dominican film. Her appearance in the film, made her one of the first actresses in the Dominican Republic. Soon after her film shoot was done, Weber married M√°ximo Coiscou y Henr√≠quez, with whom she would have a child, Rodolfo Coiscou Weber the following year. For the decade after Weber and Coicou married, they would alternate living in Europe with living in Santo Domingo, as he was a diplomat and the in charge of the Dominican Official Mission for Research in the Archives of Spain and France. They lived at various times in Austria, France and Spain. When the couple first left the Dominican Republic, they arrived in Seville and later moved to Madrid. Weber worked with the Sisters of Charity in Madrid, who had founded a nursery and home for orphans. She also lived in Paris, Switzerland and Vienna and during this time added three more sons to the family, Enrique, Antonio and Salvador Coiscou Weber. Her paining in her first phase (1920-1930) tended to be monochrome figures or meditations of affective piety. In August, 1927, Weber returned to Santo Domingo with her mother-in-law, Altagracia Henr√≠quez Perdomo de Coiscou. Feminism had waned on the island after the U.S. occupation ended, to revive the movement, but give the movement a new focus, Weber and Abigail Mej√≠a Soli√®re founded the Club Nosotras in 1927. The club broadly focused on promotion of the arts and culture, but were also involved in attaining suffrage. In 1931, the club reorganized as Dominican Feminist Action () with Mej√≠a serving as director general and Weber as the secretary-general. The organization would become the most important feminist group of the era. In 1934, Weber's marriage ended, after a tumultuous decade characterized by her husband's bouts of jealousy and alcoholism. She began publishing again; many pieces she had written in the 1920s, like \\"Accuas vivas\\" were first released after the dissolution of her marriage. She also entered the second phase of her painting development, which spanned from about 1930-1960. During this period, Weber's classical training was evident in the mostly portraits and still lifes she produced. Her palette consisted of four principal colors‚Äîblack, brown, green, and yellow‚Äîaccented with pink. Subjects, whether figures or forms were at rest, painted as she saw them without movement or nudity. The stagnant forms were a commentary of the restrictions on her life. In 1934 with the rise of the authoritarian president Rafael Trujillo, Abigail Mej√≠a steered AFD to align with Trujillo in the hopes for an increase in women's rights. In that year, a test vote was held to see how women would vote if they were granted suffrage and Mej√≠a declared that \\"96,427 feminist and trujillista women voted\\". In return for their support, Trujillo revised the civil code to give women full citizenship in 1940. The following year, Mej√≠a died and Weber ascended to the office of director general for the AFD, continuing to press for more rights. At the same time, in 1941, Weber and her son Rodolfo worked together to establish the Alpha & Omega Recreational Literary Club. (). Held in Weber's home and headed by Rodolfo, with Weber advising, the club functioned as a literary and music salon, where members performed and critiqued artistic works. In 1942, the AFD became the Women's Branch of the Dominican Party, losing the club's autonomy. There was little choice, as only party members could mobilize and be politically active. That same year, women were guaranteed equal access to education and employment, married women were granted civil equality with their spouses and all women attained suffrage. With the push for civil and political rights over, Weber's focus changed to her personal life. She married the Spanish exile, √Ålvaro Cartea Bonmat√≠. During the decade between 1942 and 1952, she published the majority of her works, including Los viajeros (1944), Apuntes (1949), Los bellos designios (1949) and Dora y otros cuentos (1952). In 1952, Alpha and Omega Club folded because of accusations by Trujillo that Rodolfo was plotting against the government and propagating communist doctrines. In 1960, Weber entered the final stage of her painting trajectory. Early works moved toward Impressionism, with her usual four color palette supplemented with blues and violets. Toward the end of the decade, her works moved toward abstract expressionism, using a broader range of colors incorporating bright white lights, celestial blues, lilac, orange and purple tones. In 1969, she prepared her first solo show of 42 canvases, which was well received by reviewers, who praised her landscapes as pictorial and filled with intense emotion with a well-balanced sense of harmony and color. Around the same time, Pedro Ren√© Cont√≠n Aybar, published twelve photographs of Weber's works taken by Napole√≥n Leroux in a volume, Exposici√≥n de Delia Weber. Death and legacy Weber died on 28 December 1982 at the family home on Calle Arzobispo Meri√±o. She was buried in Christ the Redeemer Cemetery after a ceremony for family and friends.

Additionally, their mission was to shine their lens on all shades of Blackness during a time when dark skin was considered by some as a handicap in the entertainment industry.

After studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, she became one of the significant figures in the American etching revival movement. She acquired prominence in one of the most difficult of arts, and was accepted in some respects as an authority in a field where far more men than women were in competition. Early years and education Blanche Dillaye was born in 1851, in Syracuse, New York. She was the daughter of the Hon. Stephen D. Dillaye, of Syracuse, whose writings on economic subjects such as paper money and the tariff won him an enviable reputation, and Charlotte B. Malcolm Dillaye. She was educated at Miss Mary L. Bonney and Miss Harriette L. Dillaye's school (later known as the Ogontz College; still later, known as Penn State Abington) for young ladies. In the school, as had been the case from early childhood, Dillaye evinced a talent for drawing, and a genuine artistic appreciation of pictures. So marked was her ability and so strong her desire to be an artist, that she was allowed to devote a year to the study of drawing. She went abroad, but her final work came in connection with the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. Career Blanche Dillaye After returning from abroad, she taught in a young ladies' school in Philadelphia. This enabled her to study for several years at the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. Her fondness was for black and white, and she was attracted toward etching as a specialty. Masters in this branch aided her and found an apt pupil. She took one lesson of Stephen Ferrier in the technique of etching. It seemed so simple that she unhesitatingly sent in her name as a contributor to an exhibition to be held in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and went so far as to order her frame. She knew little of the vicissitudes of the etcher, but she was on the way to learn, for, when the exhibition opened, her labor was represented only by an underbitten plate, an empty frame, the name in the catalogue of a never-finished etching, and the knowledge that etching represented patient labor as well as inspiration. The same year, Stephen Parrish came to her rescue, and by his counsel and assistance, enabled her to work with insight and certainty. Dillaye's impressions were vivid and marked by a strong originality. In the rage for etchings that prevailed at the end of the 19th century, Dillaye never condescended to degrade the art to popular uses, but maintained that true painter-etcher's style which first brought her into notice. Dillaye was a contributor to the leading exhibitions in the US. At the Columbian Exposition, she represented the state of Pennsylvania in the judgment of etchings, and during the exposition's progress, a paper on her art was read by her before the Congress of Women, which attracted wide attention. Her etchings were also favorably received abroad, having been exhibited successfully in England and in the Paris Salon. Dillaye had additional artistic ambitions. Her studio on South Penn Square, Philadelphia, showed talent in various other mediums. Her illustrations and manuscripts found their way into several leading magazines. She occupied many official positions in connection with art matters. She served as Vice-President of at least three organizations: Philadelphia Water Color Club, Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and The Plastic Club. Dillaye died in 1932, 1931 is also mentioned. Gallery JENKINS(1884) p090 THE OLD HOUSE OF OWEN EVANS. LATER THE RESIDENCE OF CALEB FOULKE, AND DR.

She is a Yankunytjatjara / Kokatha woman born on Kaurna land in South Australia. Eckermann has written poetry collections, verse novels and a memoir, and has been shortlisted for or won several literary awards. In 2017, she won the international Windham-Campbell Literature Prize for Poetry. She has travelled extensively, performing her poetry. Early life Ali Cobby Eckermann was born Penelope Rae Cobby at the Kate Cocks Memorial Babies‚Äô Home in Adelaide, traditional home of the Kaurna people, in 1963. She was adopted as a baby by a Lutheran couple, Clarrie and Frieda Eckermann. She grew up on a farm, and did her schooling at Brinkworth Area School and Clare High School, in mid-north South Australia. Eckermann, her mother and her grandmother were all stolen, tricked or adopted away from their birth families, becoming part of the Stolen Generations. She grew up in a loving supportive home, but she was assaulted sexually by a family friend when she seven years old, and experienced ongoing abuse and racism while growing up. At 17 she left home with a man with whom she lived for two years, but whom she left due to his violence. She returned home, only to discover she was pregnant, and gave birth when she was 19. Her son was adopted out. After turning 18, Eckermann began searching for her birth mother, Audrey, but didn't find her until she was 34, after information had been released with the Bringing Them Home report in 1997. Four years later, she found her son Jonnie. Most of her early adult life was spent in the Northern Territory, on Arrernte country, Jawoyn country and Larrakia country. She worked in various places, including a remote arts centre outside Alice Springs. She says \\"I learnt to live in two different ways over my life. I learnt a good example of hard work and kindness from growing up with my mum and dad in my adopted family. And I‚Äôm extremely grateful that my traditional family welcomed me back with such love and honesty. I got a second chance to live in an honest world\\". Writing career Eckermann's literary career was established in 2009 after she submitted her first collection of poetry to a manuscript competition run by Australian Poetry. It was published under the title, Little Bit Long Time, first in pamphlet form by the Australian Poetry Centre and then in book form, both in 2009. Its subject matter is the problematic history of Indigenous Australians since colonial times, which means that she explores both her own life and experience, as an indigenous woman, as well as looking at the historical perspective. She returns to this subject matter repeatedly in her work. Since then, she has published three more poetry collections, two verse novels and a memoir. Her third book, and second verse novel, Ruby Moonlight, was awarded both Book of the Year and the Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry in the 2013 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards. Eckermann founded Australia's first Aboriginal Writers Retreat in Koolunga, in a 130-year-old general store which she restored. In 2014, she participated in the International Writing Program's Fall Residency at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, United States. =Verse novels= Eckermann has written two verse novels, His Father's Eyes and Ruby Moonlight. Ruby Moonlight is set in remote South Australia in the 1880s. It explores, writes Sarah Holland-Batt, \\"broader ideas about colonialism‚Äôs hierarchies and power structures, and its lingering historical impact on the first peoples of this country, on language, and on the very landscape itself. One of the most remarkable things about Ruby Moonlight is the subtlety with which its political implications are handled: Eckermann invites (rather than dictates) political readings of what is, at heart, a simple and highly engaging narrative.\\" Awards and nominations * 2013 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, winner of Book of the Year and Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry for Ruby Moonlight * 2013 Tangkanungku Pintyanthi Fellowship for Too Afraid to Cry * 2014 Adelaide Festival Awards for Literature John Bray Poetry Award, shortlisted for Ruby Moonlight * 2015 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, shortlisted for Indigenous Writers' Prize for Inside My Mother * 2015 Victorian Premier's Literary Awards, shortlisted for Inside My Mother * 2017 Windham-Campbell Literature Prizes for Poetry * 2018 Australia Council for the Arts Literature Fellowship Bibliography * (poetry collection) * (poetry collection) * (verse novel) * (poetry collection) * (memoir) * (poetry collection)  References  1963 births Living people Australian women poets Indigenous Australian writers Writers from South Australia 21st-century Australian novelists 21st-century Australian women writers 21st-century Australian poets ","title":"Ali Cobby Eckermann"},{"id":"53416815","text":"Shirley Aldythea Marshall Seymour Andrews was recognised throughout her life (1915‚Äì2001) for her work as a biochemist, dancer, researcher and Aboriginal rights activist.  Early life and education  Andrews was born on November 5, 1915, to Doris Andrews and Arthur Andrews. Andrews grew up in Sandringham, Victoria, living with her mother, grandmother and uncle. She attended school at Miss Montford's school, in Sandringham, until the age of eleven. Later, she boarded at St Michael's grammar in St Kilda, Victoria. After graduating from St Michael's, Andrews enrolled in a science course at the University of Melbourne, from 1934 to 1937. In her first years at university she rented houses and apartments with her mother in the Melbourne area. Andrews also began to learn ballet during her time at university. She took lessons from Edouard Borovansky and later became interested in Australian folk dance. Andrews helped establish the folk dance society and the Victorian folk music club, meanwhile continuing her studies at university. She wrote a book on traditional dancing in Australia. After completing her bachelor of science degree, Andrews was offered a Caroline Kay scholarship to the veterinary school at Melbourne University. After accepting the scholarship offer, Andrews worked at the Veterinary School for six years, doing biochemical testing on animal tissue and fluids.  Careers  Following her time at Melbourne University, Andrews joined the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in 1947, as a research officer. Later on, the organisation (CSIRO) became aware of a relationship that had developed between Andrews and the secretary of the Seamen's Union. The ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) informed the CSIRO of the connection, causing Andrews to find it difficult to continue her works at the organisation. Andrews left the CSIRO in 1951.  Aboriginal rights activity  In 1951, Andrews became a founding member and secretary of the Council for Aboriginal Rights (CAR). The CAR is a confederation striving for equal rights for Aborigines. The CAR also contributed to the establishment of the 1967 referendum, when Australia voted to count Aborigines in the census. Andrews worked tirelessly to provide a political focus on Aboriginal rights for the next 20 years.  Overview  Although Andrews preferred to work in the backroom, she was a self-confident leader. She showed these qualities and many more while working throughout her life to make significant changes to Australian society. Andrews called herself a 'liberated woman' and believed strongly in women's rights. She never married, nor did she have children, although she did have one significant relationship with Bill Bird, secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia. Her choice to remain single and childless was a point of difference between her and her acquaintances.

Early life  She was born Clara Lodge in Limerick, Ireland, in 1819. She eloped with her dancing teacher, George Du Val (brother of portrait painter Charles Allen Du Val) at an early age. They had three children; Oliver, Francis and Clara, and came to the attention of the law on several occasions. In one incident her husband was arrested in Liverpool after being involved in a kidnapping gone wrong.  Arriving in Australia  How Ballarat appeared in the summer of 1853‚Äì54, around the time of Clara's arrival. Painting by Eugene von Guerard Clara Du Val arrived in Melbourne, Australia in May 1853, with two of her children, but without her husband, and having recorded her age as 20 (she was actually 34). There is no further record of George Du Val; it is not known whether he died, or they separated. Her two sons accompanied her, but her daughter Clara was left behind in Ireland. She became an actress at a tent theatre set up in an area known as the Gravel Pits in the gold mining town of Ballarat, and conducted a theatrical company there.  The Ballarat Times  By 1854, Clara had become the de facto wife of Henry Seekamp, editor and publisher of The Ballarat Times, and 10 years her junior. Although they referred to each other as husband and wife, and Clara and her younger children took Seekamp's name, no official record of a marriage has been found. The Ballarat Times was run in their household, which was on Bakery Hill, close to the Gravel Pits. The newspaper was successful, and the little building they had had before was turned into a compound which consisted of: a printing office, stables, a kitchen, a separate residence, office and a coach-house. Her husband was a supporter of the Ballarat Reform League, and the newspaper's fiery editorials on behalf of the miners eventually drew government attention. The day after the Eureka Stockade, Henry Seekamp was arrested for Seditious Libel on 4 December 1855.  Writing  Historian Clare Wright speculates that Clara herself may have written some of the offending editorials, (Henry claimed in his defence that he had not written all of them) as she was erudite enough, and more convenient than other candidates that have been suggested. Certainly while Henry was in jail, Clara took over the running of the Ballarat Times, becoming the first female editor of an Australian newspaper, and her editorials proved equally, if not more outspoken than her husband's. After Governor Hotham accused unnamed 'foreigners' of stirring up the rebellion, Clara responded with the New Year's Day editorial of 1855, writing: \\"What is it that constitutes a foreigner?...'Could you not have found some other and' more truthful excuse for all the illegal and even murderous excesses committed by your soldiery and butchers ? Could you not admit that the whole affair was brought about by acts of our tyrannical, corrupt, and unjust local government?... What is this country else than Australia? Is it any more England than it is Ireland or Scotland, France or America, Italy or Germany ? Is the population, wealth, intelligence, enterprise and learning wholly and solely English ?... No, the population of Australia is not English but Australian, and sui generis. Any one who immigrates into this country, no matter from what clime or of what people, and contributes towards the development of its resources and its wealth, is no longer a foreigner...The latest immigrant is the youngest Australian\\" The Geelong Advertiser commented that \\"The Ballarat Times contains...a manifesto from Mrs Seekamp...startling in its tone...and the free use of the words sedition, liberty and oppression\\" and hoped for a \\"lenient sentence upon Mr Seekamp and a quick return to his editorial duties\\" to relieve the \\"dangerous influence of a free press petticoat government\\" She protested her husband's sentence, amassing 3000 signatures for a petition to have him freed, and due to public outcry Henry was released after only 3 months. However, before he could return, on 1 March she and a guest were held at gunpoint and robbed by a former employee while tallying up the newspapers accounts. The thieves escaped with almost 100 pounds, but were later arrested and jailed after Clara gave evidence.  Later life  Henry was not well after being released from jail, and his poor health led to the eventual sale of the Ballarat Times in late 1856. Clara's daughter, now seven, had travelled from Ireland, and joined the family. The government, wanting to expand the road the Ballarat Times was situated on, compulsorily acquired portions of the land in 1856 and 1859. Clara petitioned for money from the government to make up for her loss of business income and property value; after many delays the government eventually awarded her 500 pounds in 1862. Whether Clara and Henry were still living together is not clear. He appears to have been in New South Wales in 1860, and Queensland at some point in 1862. He died there in January 1864. Clara and her three children had moved to Melbourne. In 1868 her daughter Clara died from diphtheria at the age of 18, and later that year her son Oliver was arrested for stealing building materials from empty houses. She is reported as appearing in court \\"much grieved with her son's position\\" and offered that \\"his name was down for a situation in the General Post Office\\" in his defence. She wrote a letter asking for financial help from the Victorian Press Association in 1873, and a letter of correction to The Age confirming her former husband's status as founder of The Ballarat Times in 1877. Oliver died of lead poisoning in 1884. Clara herself died in Pascoe Vale, Melbourne at her son Francis' house on 22 January 1908. She is buried with Oliver in Melbourne General Cemetery.

He graduated in 1920 in mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic University of Turin and later in mathematics in 1930. At first he carried out a technical activity, later (1931‚Äì38) he became a professor of mechanics at the Regio Istituto Industriale (Royal Industrial college) \\"Omar\\" in Milan. Rational mechanics lecturer since 1935, he was appointed for such subject at the University of Turin and of Modena. In 1940 he was the first of a group of three (the others were Maria Pastori and Giovanni Lampariello) at the public competitive examination for the teaching post in rational mechanics at the University of Messina: he was called to Catania from where, in the immediate postwar period, he was able to be transferred to Turin.

He played college football at LSU. Early years Riley attended John Curtis Christian High School in River Ridge, Louisiana. He committed to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play college football.LSU expected to receive commitment from John Curtis linebacker Duke Riley College career Riley played at LSU from 2013 to 2016. After spending his first three seasons as a backup, he became a starter for the first time his senior year in 2016.Duke Riley following Deion Jones' lead as a senior starter at LSUChasing the dream: After 3-year wait, 'Little Duke' Riley emerges as force for LSU That season, he had 93 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and one interception and was named the teams MVP.Hard work is way of life for NFL prospect Duke Riley of LSUDuke Riley trying to add to LSU LB tradition at Senior BowlLSU linebacker Duke Riley awarded team MVP at senior banquet Professional career On November 16, 2016, it was reported that Riley had accepted an invitation to play in the Reese's Senior Bowl, joining LSU teammates Tre'Davious White, Ethan Pocic, Travin Dural, and Kendell Beckwith. On January 2, 2017, it was announced by Lil' Wayne on Instagram that Riley had signed with his company Young Money APAA Sports, and had successfully merged with his Young Money Entertainment record label. He became the company's first client they represented. He had an impressive week of practices at the Senior Bowl under Cleveland Browns' head coach Hue Jackson, showing athleticism, quick instincts, and range. On January 28, 2017, Riley recorded a team-high seven combined tackles (four solo), helping the South defeat the North 16-15. His overall performance was spectacular during the 2017 Senior Bowl and was thought to immensely improve his draft stock. He received an invitation to the NFL Combine and completed nearly all of the required drills, but opted to skip the short shuttle and three-cone drill. On April 5, 2017, Riley participated at LSU's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only perform positional drills. Over 125 team representatives and scouts attended, including head coaches Sean Payton (Saints), Mike Tomlin (Steelers), Mike Mularkey (Titans), Todd Bowles (Jets), and Jim Caldwell (Lions). Riley opted to run the 40-yard dash (4.64), 20-yard dash (2.67), and 10-yard dash again while also performing positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Riley was projected to be a second to fourth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the seventh best outside linebacker by NFLDraftScout.com. =Atlanta Falcons= 2017 The Atlanta Falcons selected Riley in the third round (75th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was reunited with former LSU teammate Deion Jones who Riley looked at as a role model as an elite linebacker at LSU. Riley also wore number 0 at the Senior Bowl to hopefully begin a tradition that began with Jones when he was the first player to wear the number 0 in a Senior Bowl. On May 11, 2017, the Atlanta Falcons signed Riley to a four-year, $3.51 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $889,752. Throughout training camp, Riley competed with De'Vondre Campbell, Josh Keyes, J'Terius Jones, and Jermaine Grace for the starting weakside linebacker position. Head coach Dan Quinn named him the backup weakside linebacker to veteran De'Vondre Campbell to begin the season. He earned his first start in the Atlanta Falcons' season-opener against the Chicago Bears and made six combined tackles in the 24-17 victory. Riley earned his first career start at weakside linebacker with De'Vondre Campbell starting at the strongside linebacker position over Vic Beasley. Duke Riley, De'Vondre Campbell, and Deion Jones were the starting linebacker corp in the Atlanta Falcons' big base package. Unfortunately, Riley missed four tackles during the game, but played 49 out of 67 defensive snaps. On October 22, 2017, Riley recorded a solo tackle in a 7-23 loss to the New England Patriots, but left the game after tearing his meniscus. He underwent successful surgery to repair the tear and missed the next four games (Weeks 8-11). He finished his rookie season in 2017 with 30 combined tackles (15 solo) in 12 games and six starts. The Atlanta Falcons finished third in the NFC South with a 10‚Äì6 record and earned a wildcard berth. On January 6, 2018, Riley appeared in his first career playoff game and made two combined tackles during a 26‚Äì13 victory at the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Wild Card Round. The following week, he made one tackle as the Falcons lost 15‚Äì10 in the NFC Divisional Round to the Philadelphia Eagles. 2018 Riley had a disappointing 2018 campaign, and saw his role diminish throughout the season. Initially Riley entered training camp slated as the starting weakside linebacker, but saw minor competition for the role from Foyesade Oluokun, who ended up surpassing Riley on the depth chart. Head coach Dan Quinn named Riley the starting weakside linebacker to begin the regular season. He started the season alongside De‚ÄôVondre Campbell and middle linebacker Deion Jones. In Week 3, he collected a season-high 13 combined tackles (nine solo) during a 43-37 loss against the New Orleans Saints. Riley began seeing a decreased snap count during the season and eventually lost his starting role to Foyesade Oluokun in Week 13 and remained a backup for the remainder of the season. He finished the season with 60 combined tackles (37 solo) and two pass deflections in 16 games and ten starts. He received an overall grade of 44.2 from Pro Football Focus, which ranked 87th among all qualifying linebackers in 2018. =Philadelphia Eagles= On September 30, 2019, Riley was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles for safety Johnathan Cyprien and a swap of late-round picks. On January 2, 2020 Riley was named special teams captain for the Eagles Wild card match up with Seattle. In Week 5 of the 2020 season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Riley led the team with 13 tackles (7 solo) and injured himself when forcing a fumble on tight end Eric Ebron and he had to be carted off the field. Without Riley, the Eagles lost 38‚Äì29.

Gowan is a March 1998 case tried by the Ontario Court of Justice which ruled that, while a woman being topless as form of protest and free speech is legal, her being topless while she engages in a commercial purpose such as prostitution is illegal.R v. Gowan [3 March 1998] Doc. Ottawa 97-20544 (Ontario Court of Justice, Provincial Division). Details of the case On June 3, 1997, 31-year-old prostitute J. Gowan took her shirt off and bared her breasts on Montreal Road in the Ontario city of Vanier. Afterwards, Gowan held her breasts, pulled her nipples, and asked nearby car drivers several times if they \\"want to fuck\\" her. On two occasions, Gowan did this while she was leaning into other people's cars during a red light. Considering Gowan's behavior‚Äîrather than her toplessness itself‚Äîto be indecent, Cecile Couture reported Gowan to the authorities. Ruling In her ruling, Judge Jennifer Blishen stated that the evidence indicates that the purpose of Gowan's toplessness and provocative behavior was to engage in prostitution and that thus, unlike the actions of Ontario woman Gwen Jacob several years earlier, Gowan's toplessness was commercial in nature. In addition, Blishen stated that she \\"cannot find that the community would tolerate the use of a woman's bare breasts in public in order to sell any form of service or product\\" since \\"[s]uch conduct would appear to promote the objectification of women and the accompanying social harm.\\" Elaborating on this, Blishen wrote that Gowan's actions \\"portray women in a humiliating manner as sex objects, with the resulting loss of dignity.\\" Thus, Blishen found that Gowan's actions constituted an indecent act in a public place contrary to section 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code\\" and that thus Gowan is \\"guilty as charged.\\" As a result of her conviction for indecent behavior, Gowan was fined $250. Criticism In her 2009 book Law's Dream of a Common Knowledge, Mariana Valverde criticized this ruling by arguing that it ensured that \\"the women who have the best 'lawful excuse,' as law puts it, to go around topless are expressly forbidden from doing so.\\" Elaborating on this, Valverde states that a \\"new line has been drawn, between the speaking, rational, political woman, who can now bare her breasts even in the presence of unsuspecting children, and the whore of old, who must be covered while outdoors.\\" References Ontario case law Prostitution law in Canada 1998 in Canadian case law 1998 in Ontario ","title":"R. v.

Policies are created by governments and organizations where they see the issues arising in the health of their jurisdiction related to the environment. There are several environmental factors that can contribute to health including air quality, climate change, toxic drinking water, and toxic chemical exposure. Depending on the region the policy is in, different environmental factors are going to be addressed in the policy. Some effects of the environment on health can include asthma, malaria, cholera, disease, cancer, and physical injury. These are also dependent on the area in which the individual lives, and how severe the environmental factors are. Climate change issues have become more prevalent in the 21st century, requiring action from global leaders. When there are substantial changes to the environment, a populations health is vulnerable to potential risks. Environmental health policy can be implemented at many levels of government, including the municipal, state and international levels. Municipal governments focus on policies that affect the boundaries they control, while state governments focus on several cities or states within their borders where environment affects health. International policies involve the cooperation of several states to implement the same policy to address larger environmental issues on health like pollution and climate change. Developing nations take a different approach to environmental health politics than developed nations. Developing nations do not always have the same access to resources to implement policies that can improve the environment and health of their citizens. Environmental factors can have an unequal effect on lower income and ethnic minority regions being exposed to environmental stressors and a lower quality of life.  Definition  Environmental Health Policy is the combination between the environment and the health of citizens in a defined area. When defining Environmental Health policy it is best to break down the concept into three separate groups: environment, health and policy. The environment aspect of the term refers to the ecosystems and the environmental factors that can affect human health. Health refers to the human beings ability to function successfully when environmental factors are constantly changing. In its more simplistic definition, health is the overall well-being of a person. Policy is a \\"course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business, or individual\\". Environmental Health Policy refers to the human impact on the environment, which in turn affects human health and requires policy action.  Environmental Factors  One environmental factor that contributes to the health of the global community is climate change. Climate change is the long term rising and/or dropping of temperatures and the deviation of weather patterns over time. As a result of climate change, the Canadian Arctic has increased in temperature by three or four degrees. As the warming of the Northern Arctic continues, a surplus of water enters the system. Whether the surplus is due to rain or melting snow, an increased amount of pathogens enter the fresh water. With increasing weather extreme trends, vector and water-borne diseases, as well as allergies become more prevalent in these conditions. These infectious diseases and what accompanies them (mosquitoes, tics etc.) rely upon the environment to spread and survive. The reproduction and spread of these diseases are severely affected by weather fluctuations. Air pollution is another environmental factor that has been proven to be an influence on health. Air pollution has become a more serious issue in recent years as developing nations are experiencing a high birth rate and low death rate. The more people that are in these regions means the more resources required to sustain them. Air pollution comes in two forms; emission and transmission. These pollutants come from various sources, such as modes of transportation, the burning of fossil fuels, or naturally from the ground. Rising sea levels is another environmental factor that affects the health of individuals in a given region. One of the reasons why sea levels begin to rise is due to the melting of large glacier ice. If the glacier icecaps start melting faster, sea levels will be affected. Another way that the sea levels rise is when temperatures increase, the water molecules expands and require more space. As sea levels start to rise, the shore line starts to expand. In serious situations, this causes people to become environmental refugees. As the sea level rises it starts to affect valuable land used for food and other harvesting. 200 million people is the number of people that are at risk of flooding should the sea level rise 40 cm by the 2080s.  Health Risks  The health risks that are a result of the environment are starting to affect people around the globe. It is estimated that the increasing temperatures over the past 30 years have resulted in the deaths of 150,000 lives each year. Europe in the summer of 2003 experienced higher than normal temperatures resulting in the deaths of approximately 22,000 to 45,000 in the span of two weeks. This has been the worst effect of climate change in recent history. Increasing rates of extreme temperature are directly related to increased mortality. Some of the health risks that come with extreme temperatures are heat stress, cardio vascular failure, Hypothermia, etc. The temperature affects the malaria parasites in the mosquitoes and its ability to incubate as well as how likely the mosquitoes are to blood feed. Mosquitoes thrive in the transmission of parasites where temperatures do not exceed 25 degrees Celsius. Excessive rain, which is becoming more frequent amongst many countries, acts as the perfect breeding site for the aquatic beginning of a mosquito's life. Malaria is a vector- borne disease that is extremely prevalent in Africa. The disease puts billions of people at risk of contracting the virus. Due to a lack of sufficient healthcare where the disease is most concentrated, many people die. The environment is a huge contributor to the success malaria has in transmitting the disease. One of the more common health risks that people encounter is a result of air pollutants and air quality. Allergic Asthma is a chronic disease that affects individual's inflammatory system when they are exposed to allergens resulting in shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Environmental factors such as, air pollutants, tobacco smoke, emission fumes, and other allergens in the air when absorbed through the body are said to have an influence on allergic asthma. Climate change can affect humans' respiratory health by aggravating respiratory disease or increasing exposure to potential risks of the disease. Climate change can affect the respiratory system by the amount of pollen and allergens in the air, mold proliferation, and the effects of the ozone layer. The increase of temperatures results in putting a strain on the respiratory system often causing asthma and other lung diseases. Some of the health risks that are closely related to the respiratory system are asthma, rhnosinusitis, respiratory tract infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Perspectives  = Municipal level =  Hamilton, Ontario (Canada)  The Hamilton steel mill region has had higher levels of air pollution than the rest of the city. The effect of air pollution in the region has resulted in the spending of $537 million per year on health care and other associated costs. Many health issues that arise with air pollution in Hamilton is premature death, respiratory problems, and cardiovascular problems. Hamilton is taking the initiative to spread awareness around environmental issues with the implementation of yearly summits. Vision 2020 is a community based development program which encourages community reporting of environmental issues, which influences policy.  Rochester, New York (United States of America)  In 2005, the city of Rochester enacted a rental housing-based lead law when the incidence of childhood lead poisoning was rising. The new amendment to the housing code requires a lead inspection of rental properties built before 1978, with a focus on deteriorating paint within and outside the house. The law requires property owners to remove any lead based paint and dust from the premise and obtain a certificate of occupancy before they are able to rent out the property again. In order to keep compliance with the law, Rochester allows owners to be trained in lead safe repair work so Environmental Protection Agency workers are not required to correct violations.  Harlem, New York (United States of America)  Harlem, along with many areas of the United States, have taken on a community based participatory research method to examine environmental health policy. The West Harlem Environmental ACTion Inc. and Columbia University's Centre for Children's Environmental Health studied the effects of diesel pollution on the environment, and provided the results to the government, which transformed their environmental health policies to accommodate the results. Respiratory health was the main concern for the policy change, which was traced back to particular matter and carbon within local diesel sources. Harlem reconstructed their bus fleet system by using clean diesel and installation of permanent air monitors to control the amount of air pollution created by buses.  Sao Paulo, Brazil  The metropolitan area of S√£o Paulo has dealt with issues of air and water pollution created by motor vehicles and inadequate treatment of sewage. Infectious and parasitic diseases, circulatory diseases, and respiratory problems have all been a concern in S√£o Paulo. The city uses data linkages (HEADLAMP) between the environment and health in order to influence future policies. Air pollution has been improved marginally in regards to industrial pollution, but motor vehicle traffic creates the largest amount of sulphur dioxide emissions. Water treatment plants have not grown to accommodate the growing population, but piped water and sanitation facilities have been expanding. Impacts of the environment on health have been felt more in the poorer areas of the city compared to the wealthier sectors. = State level =  Developed nations  = Canada = Canada has dealt with lead exposure for decades, decreasing since the 1970s with the phasing out of lead paint and gasoline. While there has been a decrease in lead poisoning, there is still cases of exposure to lead from paint and old pipes in homes. Lead exposure is more harmful for pregnant women and children, making them more prone to poisoning. Lead was listed as a toxic substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The government implemented regulations against lead to foster a healthy environment. The First Nations and Inuit Health Branch attempts to ensure that these communities are given equal access to health services comparable to those in similar locations of Canada. Health Canada defines a health environment to include safe water, food, maintained housing and facilities, disposal of waste, and the ability to prevent and control disease. The Environmental Public Health Program is implemented in several aboriginal communities, customized to specific needs including food security, clean water sources, and improving poor housing conditions. = United States = The United States has several policies to deal with chemical exposure, air quality, energy, oil pollution, and safe drinking water. Public exposure to chemicals can have effects on the body including cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma and obesity. Those who work in industrial and agriculture sectors are more prone to exposure, but children, pregnant women, and those with chronic medical conditions are also at a higher risk of exposure. The United States has implemented the Toxic Substances Control Act to deal with chemical exposure and ensure chemicals are safe and citizens are minimally affected. The EPA is developing clean diesel fuels and biodiesel to deal with air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions. These types of emissions can affect respiratory health, risk of cancer, and increased medical costs of the population. In 2013, transportation was more than half on carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides produced in the environment. The country has also implemented vehicle emission standards to cut pollution from motor vehicles. = Norway = Norway has several environmental regulations dealing with pollution, air quality, and water. There are also policies in place to protect citizen's health and well-being in general, and in the workplace. Workplaces must ensure they have measures to prevent or contain pollution, along with voluntarily preparing environmental impact statements that are available to pollution control authority. If facilities produce carbon dioxide emissions, then they must apply for a discharge permit, and have to report yearly emissions to pollution control authorities. Norway attempts to protect its water sources from contamination by ensuring facilities implement measures that cause the least amount of harm or inconvenience to the public or corporations. The government puts policies in place to ensure the safety of employee health at all levels, and takes action on any hazards within the workplace that would put health at risk. = Turkey = Air quality in Turkey is currently at levels that are considered harmful to human health. Lung capacity growth of children is diminished in areas of high air pollution, which can increase chances of lung disease. Risks to lung health include asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, lung cancer, and emphysema which can be intensified by poor air quality. Coal power in Turkey has been a critical factor of air pollution. The power plants release sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, which can last in the environment for up to forty years. The Turkish Medical Association expressed concerns about increasing the number of coal plants in Turkey, and suggested a phasing out of coal plants to increase air quality in the country to safe levels. = Germany = The Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Health have coordinated with agencies and scientific institutions to understand environmental health issues. Germany has had a long history of environmental health policies in order to maintain the well being of citizens. Policies are based on scientific research and collaboration between ministries, but environmental health policies are often not on the policy agenda since it is relatively well controlled. In 2011, policies were adopted to phase out nuclear energy in the country after Fukushima nuclear disaster. Air pollution increased to the highest levels since the 1980s due to increased coal burning, putting the population at risk for chronic diseases associated with air pollution. Mining in the country had also resulted in water pollution that affects human and animal health. Coal mining has been linked to environmental and health issues, leading the government to close all mining pits by 2018. Germany has been a leading actor in dealing with carbon emissions related to climate change through policies to reduce use of resources and efficient use of renewable energy sources.  Developing nations  = China = China has large-scale mineral resources and is one of the biggest producers and consumers of metals and metalloids. Since the 1980s, they have seen an increase in pollution and degradation of natural resources, putting the health of the population at risk. Air pollution is the biggest environmental cause of cardiopulmonary disease in the country. The Asian countries are looking to research environmental factors to better understand how it affects health. China's mines have produced heavy metal polluted soils that pose a risk to human health. Those living around the area of the mines are especially at risk of the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of the soil. The main dangers come from sewage irrigation, sludge application, mining, and smelting operations. This pollution affects the human body by harming the nervous, skeletal, circulatory, enzymatic, endocrine, and immune system. More chronic effects can include cancer, bone fractures, hypertension, lesions, and neuropathy. China has conducted very few health risk assessment studies of all mines in the country, so full health risks associated with the mines are unknown. = India = In the mining communities of India, the population is at risk of respiratory illness and malaria. Those who live closer to the mines reported higher incidences of these illnesses. This has influenced environmental policy because mining is a profitable business that can be privatized, but with adverse effects on health they have been required to balance human and ecological health. India has also seen difficulty providing access to drinking water and sanitation services in rural areas. Community demand-driven programmes have been implemented since 2004 which required improvements in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. This was an effort to improve children's health, and reduce diarrhoea and water-related illnesses. Only 21% of the rural population was using a private tap, the other percentage commuted to obtain water. Only 12% used private toilets, the others travelled to a main sanitation site. The implemented program was able to increase access to filtered water, private toilets, and increased hygiene. = Nigeria = In 2014, Nigeria implemented the WHO Country Cooperation Strategy to deal with Millennium Development Goals. A strategic objective of the policy was to assess health effects of environmental risks by conducting health impact assessments. The government also plans to increase countries abilities to deal with environmental emergencies including climate change, air pollution, and radiation that could be harmful to health. The strategy focuses on creating policies to improve medicine, universal access to health care, and reduction in diseases caused by the environment. = Kenya = In 2016, the Kenya government introduced the new Kenya Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Policy. Poor sanitation has been a leading cause of mortality in the country. The new policy created a timeline from 2016-2030 in which guidelines were set for state and non-state actors to follow to improve sanitation and create a better quality of life. The aim is to have universal access to sanitation by 2030. This includes all public places and dwellings having access to sustainable toilets, free from odours, and reducing hygiene related diseases. Currently, about 72% of toilets in rural Kenya are dug pits and open defecation occurs. The amount of sanitation sewers is very low, with most not being treated. Sewage bursts and discharge of raw sewage from plants is a common practice, contaminating the earth and water supply. Air pollution in urban centres is also a concern. In Nairobi, pollution levels are three times higher than World Health Organization recommendations. Urbanization is projected to increase in the next decade, so the government has created Kenya Vision 2030 in attempts to deal with sanitation practices in the country. Kenya Visions wants to make Kenya a newly industrialized, middle-income country with a high quality of life for its citizens. = International level =  World Health Organization (WHO)  In 2006, the World Health Organization created a study on specific diseases and injuries affected by environmental risks, and which regions of the world are at the most risk of injury. WHO studies the effects and supports the design of preventative and health strategies in countries to reduce environmental health risks. Environmental factors such as air and water quality, patterns of energy use, and patterns of land use can directly and indirectly affect health of citizens. WHO's findings found that 24% of global disease and 23% of deaths are caused by environmental factors (although they vary from developing countries with 25%, and developed with 17%). Several diseases found in the study included diarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, and unintentional injuries caused by environmental factors that can be modified by policy. Infectious diseases is a higher burden in developing countries than in developed, attributed to more exposure to environmental risks and lack of access to health care. Diseases attributed to environmental factors decrease with development to either eradication, or to levels comparable to developed regions. Children are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. WHO found that children under the age of five are more prone to diseases from environmental factors than the rest of the total population. WHO has supported the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals to provide sustainable access to safe drinking water. The benefits to the MDG's is savings in health care, economic productivity, and fewer lives lost from diseases caused by contaminated water.  United Nations  In 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) were created at the UN Millennium Declaration. Leaders from all over the world gathered in aims to reduce poverty by 2015 in developing countries. Eight goals were created in order to deal with extreme poverty due to climate, shelter, and disease, and ensure everyone has the right to health, education, shelter, and security. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were created to replace the MDG, which are to be reached by 2030. These goals are aimed at both developing and developed countries, using environmental, social, and economic dimensions to meet goals. Goals 3, 6, and 11 affect environmental health policy. Goal 3 is to ensure Good Health and Well-being, which affects other goals. If environmental goals are achieved, the health of the country will be able to improve by reducing disease and death. Goal 11 of creating sustainable cities and communities is important to environmental health policy since urbanization is a big concern that can affect resources including water, which affects the health of the population. Goal 6 aims to provide clean water and sanitation in countries. Wastewater treatment in countries is an issue that the SDG goals are trying to influence countries to improve and provide better access to clean drinking water and sanitation.

Controlling a paddle-like craft, the player is tasked with clearing each stage by deflecting a ball towards a formation of bricks towards the top of the screen. Power-up items are hidden in some blocks, which can increase the size of the player's paddle, a barrier that prevents the ball from moving off the screen, and a forcefield that will release eight other balls when touched. It ran on the Namco System 1 arcade board. The game was produced by Toru Iwatani, known as the creator of Pac-Man and Pole Position. It was created as a response to Taito's 1986 arcade title Arkanoid, which helped revive the block breaker genre and inspire waves of its own clone games. A special version of the game was released shortly after the original's release, Quester: Special Edition, featuring levels designed by readers of Namco's press literature. It was ported to the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009, where it was renamed to Namco Quester. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Quester is a block breaker video game, often compared to Taito's Arkanoid. Using a rotary knob, the player controls a paddle-like craft fixed at the bottom of the screen, the objective being to deflect a ball towards a large formation of bricks in each round. A life is lost when the player misses the ball and it falls of-screen. Some blocks contain power-up items that can help the player in the stage, such as increasing the width of the paddle, place a barrier at the bottom of the screen to prevent the ball from being lost, and a forcefield that will spit out eight other balls if touched. Some stages contain \\"killer meteors\\", which can decrease the paddle's size if touched. Alongside regular colored bricks, other block types include indestructible bricks, blocks that can speed up and slow down the ball when touched, and \\"generator blocks\\" that produce an endless number of red blocks. Some stages are based on other Namco video game characters, including a Galaxian flagship, Pac-Man, and a Rainbow Block from Cutie Q. The 33rd round of the game features a boss fight with a large mechanical fortress named \\"Breeder\\", which can be destroyed by deflecting the ball against its large metal shield. Collecting a Special Flag from Rally-X will award the player an extra life. Development and release Quester was released in September 1987 by Namco in Japan only. It was produced by Toru Iwatani, known as the creator of Pac-Man and Pole Position, and designed by Shinji Noguchi. It was created to rival the success of Taito's 1986 game Arkanoid, which helped revive the block breaker genre and spark a large amount of competition in arcades. Development of the game was relatively short. The game was dedicated to Shouichi Fukatani, a developer at Namco who died in 1985 and helped create several earlier games for the company, such as Dig Dug. Music for the game was composed by Shinji Hosoe, who had very little contact with the team during development. Shortly after the original game's release, a modified version known as Quester: Special Edition was released, featuring altered level designs that were submitted by readers of Namco Community Magazine NG. Reception and legacy Game Machine listed the game on their Quester issue as being the seventeenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Mari Yamakawa of Gamest noted that the game was easier than other similar block breaker games, which made it more accessible for newer players. In a retrospective, Retro Gamer magazine listed it among the best Breakout clones, although would refer to the game's difficulty as \\"bloody hard\\" and for not doing anything ambitious with the genre, claiming it was likely the reason for its confinement in Japan.

Biography Elna Borch's sculpture, Death and the Maiden Borch was born in Roskilde, Denmark. She was the daughter of Anders Jacob Borch (1834‚Äì1904) and Martha Petrine Willumsen (1845‚Äì1922). She came from a family full of artists, including her uncle Jacob Kornerup (1825‚Äì1913), who taught her how to draw. She later learned sculpture in Copenhagen from sculptor August Saabye, who later became her instructor when she was at the Women's Art Academy. She gained the opportunity to study abroad and moved to Paris in 1900 and later to Italy. Her sculptural style references naturalism and symbolism. In Paris in 1901, she sculpted the bust Laughing Faun, and in 1902, she visited northern Italy, where she made the figure in mourning for a boy which later received the Neuhausen Prize. Borch took interest in symbolism and became one of the few Danish sculptors in this form of expression. In 1905, she made a major breakthrough with Death and the Maiden with clear stylistic references to international symbolism. She was the first female sculptor represented in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, where her most famous sculpture Death and the Maiden resides. Abroad, her work was presented in 1927 at the Danish National Exhibition in Brooklyn, New York. She was involved in the cause of animal rights. In 1936, she received the Tagea Brandts Rejselegat, a Danish award for women who have made significant contributions in the fields of science, literature or art. Although her known work is considered high quality by art dealers, Borch is today largely forgotten and little known to the general public.

By early October 1756, at Lobositz, Pennavaire's cavalry brigade had been augmented with another squadron of the Garde du Corps (178 men), giving him a brigade of just under 2000. At 11:00, with the field still shrouded in mist, Pennavaire's troopers were sent to reconnoiter the Austrian line, supported by the Bayreuth Dragoons. Quickly, though, the reconnaissance turned into firefight as the right flank of cuirassiers was enfiladed by the fire of the Austrian occupying Sullowitz. Several squadrons of Austrian dragoons also charged, and Pennavaire's most forward troops were rescued by the Bayreuth dragoons. Subsequently, Frederick pulled the cavalry out of the battle, but they had served a purpose: Frederick knew where his opponent's strengths lay. The battle lasted another seven hours, but Pennavaire and his brigade were observers.Harald Skala et al. Lobositz. kronoskaf-Seven Years' War.19 June 2016 version. Accessed 8 March 2017.

Pennavaire was promoted to lieutenant general on 18 June 1757. In the Battle of Kolin, Frederick's plan fell short of success when he attacked the Austrian front, rather than its wing. Pennavaire commanded cavalry in the center of the Prussian line, including 10 squadrons of cuirassiers. Frederick ordered several cavalry attacks in the course of trying to retrieve the battle. Pennavaire, augmented with another 10 squadrons of horse, was instructed to assault the Krzeczor Heights, supported by Zieten's cavalry and some infantry. Zieten's cavalry had problems of its own and the Duke of Bevern's infantry was already engaged. Pennavaire's men were thrown back.Robert Neville Lawley (Hon.), General Seydlitz; a military biography, For private circulation only, 1852 p. 39. Historian Christopher Duffy noted that Pennavaire's cavalry performed poorly at Kolin and that the general was nicknamed \\"The Anvil\\" because he was beaten so often. At the Battle of Breslau, the 80-year-old lieutenant general led his brigade in a charge on the Austrian crossing the Lohe river at Klein Mochbern. They were heavily strafed by Austrian grape shot and canister fire. He was badly wounded and although he recovered, he did not serve again.

The app functions in over 175 metropolitan areas around the world. Transit was designed for aggregating and mapping real-time public transit data, crowdsourcing user data to determine the true location of buses and trains. Transit was first released in 2012 for iPhone and soon after launched the Android-compatible version. It offers users schedules and alerts for multiple modes of transportation where available, including bus and rail. Transit was developed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada by Sam Vermette and Guillaume Campagna. This app is meant to minimize the need for individuals to own vehicles in cities. Transit is in direct competition with other transit mapping services such as Moovit and CityMapper, as well as general mapping services that also provide transit data such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Apple Maps. Current Transit app executives are Chief Executive Officer, Sam Vermette and Chief Business Officer, David Block-Schachter. In 2020, Transit became the official Big Blue Bus (BBB) app for travel planning and information on arriving in real-time buses.  Features  Transit is compatible with car-sharing and ride-hailing apps such as Uber, Lyft, Via, and Ola, along with multiple bike- share systems. In April 2018, the app expanded to include scooter-sharing systems in four American cities. The app provides users with a color-coded system that matches colors with modes of transportation in order for users to quickly associate a color with the mode of transportation they are monitoring. In February 2019, the Transit app released an update that allows users to look up bus and train schedules for their whole city even without a data connection, or determine if a bike-sharing station has bikes available. Even when users are offline, they are able to find the nearest public transport stops and map their journey.  Supported Regions  Transit is supported in 11 countries across the globe including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Within the United States, Transit can be used in 118 regions.  Partners  Transit supports multiple mobile ticketing platforms including Token Transit and Masabi. Users are only required to input their payment information into the app one time, and then able to purchase ride and bike- share passes within the app's interface. Transit has been endorsed by multiple cities' Transportation Authorities including the MBTA, Metro, MDOT, and the Edmonton Transit System. = Endorsers = Transit has partnered with public agencies around the world to become their official or endorsed multimodal app. Agencies that have endorsed the app include: * Boston's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA); * Los Angeles Metro (Metro); * Maryland Transit Administration (MTA); * Santa Clara, California's Valley Transportation Authority (VTA); * Tampa Bay's Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PTSA); * Montreal's Soci√©t√© de transport de Montr√©al (STM)  Investors  In 2018, Transit raised $17.5 million.

Construction commenced in 2018 with the station expected to open in 2025.  History  In December 2008, the proposal for a new underground rail corridor running north-south through the Melbourne CBD was incorporated into the Brumby Ministry's Victorian Transport Plan after originally featuring in a report from Sir Rod Eddington. It was to be built in two stages: the first from Footscray to St Kilda Road, and the second continuing to Caulfield. The need for a new rail corridor and stations through the CBD was identified in an effort to reduce congestion on the City Loop, enabling more frequent and reliable services across Melbourne's railway network. Following a change of State Government, in 2012/2013 the Baillieu and Napthine Ministries announced a revised plan with the tunnel instead running from South Kensington to South Yarra along a similar route to the original proposal. The revised project included five underground stations, including one under the working title 'CBD North' and was listed as the highest-priority infrastructure project in Melbourne by Infrastructure Australia. The project went unfunded due largely to tension between the state and federal governments. In February 2015 the proposal was revived by the newly elected Andrews Ministry with construction to commence in 2018 and the tunnel and stations planned to open in 2026. The total cost of the project is A$11 billion.  Naming  In August 2017 the Government launched a naming competition for the five new railway stations to be constructed as part of the Metro Rail Project. Following over 50,000 submissions, in November 2017 State Library was announced as the winning entry for the working-title 'CBD North' station due to its proximity to the landmark State Library of Victoria building. The other stations will be known as Anzac, Town Hall, Parkville and North Melbourne, following the winning selection of names based on geographical locations and prominent landmarks.  Location  The railway station is located below Swanston Street between La Trobe and Streets in the northern edges of Melbourne's CBD. The station will connect with Melbourne Central station via a pedestrian walkway, enabling transfer from other railway lines and will have entrances at the corner of Latrobe/Swanston Street and Franklin/Swanston Street, enabling more convenient access to City Baths and Queen Victoria Market. The initial build method chosen for construction was cut-and-cover, however this was changed in order to avoid significant disruption and to keep trams running along the world's busiest tram corridor, Swanston Street.

Life Reiss was raised ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn, New York. At 19, she was arranged to be married to someone she had known for three months. She married the man, and had two children with him. In the first week of her marriage, her then-husband showed signs of abusive behavior. Allegedly, her husband repeatedly threatened to kill her, and was violent. Reiss says she only realized that she was experiencing domestic violence when she spoke with a therapist outside of her community. Allegedly, her community members encouraged her to stay with her husband. After a particular episode of violence, Reiss went to get a temporary restraining order, and was the first woman in her community to do so. However, her rabbi sent an attorney (who was also from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community) to take Reiss to family court, to tell the judge that she wished to drop the order. Reiss was able to go to college and get a job, and thus, she felt that she was able to support her family, and leave her husband and get a divorce. She developed a five-year escape plan. Reiss graduated at 32 from Rutgers University, and was valedictorian. She began work as a journalist. Reiss left her husband after twelve years of marriage, and was shunned by her family and community after doing so. She finally was able to obtain a divorce three years later after leaving him. Reiss subsequently left Judaism, and became an atheist. Reiss has not spoken to her family since then, save for her sister on occasion. In 2016, it was announced that Reiss would become the subject of a documentary by production company Women Rising. Sara Hirsh Bordo will direct the documentary, and production on it was scheduled to begin in fall of 2016. Activism In 2011, Reiss founded the non-profit organization Unchained At Last, to support women who wish to leave arranged and forced marriages. The organization cannot help minors, although Reiss is working to change United States law so that she is able to. The organization is incorporated in New Jersey. Unchained At Last serves people from various communities. The organization tailors services to each client's background. Unchained At Last offers legal assistance and other direct services for the women. The organization also helps the women with social services, so that they can continue with their lives, as well as mentoring. Reiss has also participated in a planning session held by the White House Council on Women and Girls that would target development of a national policy on forced and arranged marriages. Reiss also collaborated with New Jersey senator Loretta Weinberg on a draft of a law that would allow women to access crime victimization records free of charge. This would allow the women to use those records as proof to obtain restraining orders. As of 2016, the organization has assisted over 250 women. Upon learning about the widespread problem of child marriage in the United States, Reiss took on ending child marriage in all 50 U.S. states. In 2018, the first two U.S. states - Delaware and New Jersey - signed laws ending all marriage before 18, due to Unchained At Last's activism and assistance.\\"Delaware becomes first US state to fully ban child marriage\\".

Reiss has also been interviewed about her personal story and her activism by several major news outlets, including The New York Times, NPR, Al Jazeera America, PBS Newshour, BBC, CBS News, NowThis, and more. In 2017, Forbes named Reiss one of five women who are tackling some of the world's \\"most urgent issues\\". Reiss was featured in Great Big Story's \\"Defenders\\" series about fearless, headstrong, undeterred women fighting for change in the spirit of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and was one of the titular \\"gutsy women\\" featured in Hillary and Chelsea Clinton's 2019 book, The Book of Gutsy Women.

She has had multiple publications in various journals and anthologies, including Mujeres de Ma√≠z, Sinister Wisdom, Americas y Latinas: A Stanford Journal of Latin American Studies, Cipactli Journal, The Lunada Literary Anthology The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the U.S. Some of Chinchilla's research interests are Latin American/Latino Studies, Gender and sexuality, Latinx discourse and cultural production, creative writing and performance, Central American Studies, Latino/as in the media, Film production and Aesthetics, Media and Communications. Chinchilla has directed two short documentaries, \\"The Last Word\\" and \\"Made in Brazil\\" both of which screened at different festivals in 2006. When she was a graduate student at San Francisco State University, she also won the STAND award in 2006 from the Film Arts Foundation. The Cha Cha Files The Cha Cha Files is a collection of poems that brings to light the Diaspora of the Central American in the United States. The book is a queer text that uses erotic language and writing, while using autobiographical references to emphasize the struggles of the Central American Woman. In addition she discusses gender performance while articulating and reclaiming her mestiza and indigenous roots.  Other literary works  Church at Night was written by Maya Chinchilla after the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2018, the poem was published in A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies. Femme on Purpose appears in The Jota Anthology. In her poem \\"Central Americanamerican\\" she \\"diffracts the construction of Central American identity beyond a geographic notion and along the multiple coordinates of migrations, generations, heritages, languages, ethnicities, races, sexualities, cultures, and discourses magnified in the Central American diasporas.\\" {{Book \\"Literatures of Central Americans in the United States\\", Ana Patricia Rodriguez, in The Routledge Companion to Latino/a Literature (2012) More information Besides her literary work, Maya Chinchilla directed various video projects including \\"Solidarity Baby\\" and \\"The Last Word\\".

History  Final Cut ( The Final Cut ) ( abbreviated TFC ) began when Anthony \\"Asrock\\" Srock, then a radio and club DJ, began collaborating with DJ Jeff Mills. The pair had their first success with the international club hit \\"Take Me Away\\" just as Detroit technos first wave was peaking. The music was a mix of industrial, house and techno, and showed Asrocks roots as a DJ absorbing different genres. Mills left for a career of minimal techno and was replaced by drummer and programmer Joseph LaFata. Asrock and LaFata took Final Cut into a more aggressive industrial direction with \\"I Told You Not To Stop\\" in the early 90s, with Srock becoming a vocalist. The single led to an album deal with Nettwerk Records, home to fellow industrial act Skinny Puppy. The resulting album was 1992s Consumed. The album featured collaborations with Revolting Cocks/Ministry alumni Chris Connelly and William Tucker. For 1992s Consumed, Final Cut toured with an all- live, sampler-free, full-band supporting Chris Connellys band and My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. Srock returned with 1995's Atonement, recorded at Chicago's Warzone Studios and first released on Chemlabs Fifth Column Records and then re-released in 1998 on Slipdisc/Mercury. In the year 2004 in Los Angeles Asrock began working on a new full-length record \\"Method of Operation\\" with Cr33py, TrippKILLER, Xristian Simon, and Taime Downe, an old acquaintance from Pigface and frontman for sleaze rock bands Faster Pussycat and the Newlydeads. In addition former Big Chief guitarist Phil Durr, and production from Baltimore vocalist Ric Peters and Chicago engineer Jason McNinch joined in. Working digitally between Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles over the course of 2005-2006, Asrock and his band pieced together Method of Operation. Asrock is currently based in Detroit. In 2006, after the death of his Mother (2005) and then Father (2006) Asrock resurrected Full Effect Records, his own label, and Final Cut's original label. His work on Method of Operation came to a halt after several deaths and a period as he describes as his \\"benzopalooza\\". In 2009 the Prodigy's \\"Warriors Dance\\", which includes a sample from Final Cuts \\"Take Me Away\\", went to #1 on the UK dance singles charts, and reached #8 on USA's billboard charts.

It is the second all-new car in the McLaren Super Series, replacing the 650S beginning in May 2017. The 720S was launched at the Geneva Motor Show on 7 March 2017 and is built on a modified carbon monocoque, which is lighter and stiffer in contrast to the 650S.  Specifications  The 720S is the first all new car to be introduced by McLaren as a part of its new plan to launch 15 new cars into the market by 2022. The 720S according to McLaren is 91% new as compared to its predecessor. = Engine = The 720S features McLaren's new M840T engine which is an evolution of the M838T used in the 650S. It is a twin-turbocharged V8 engine. However, the stroke has been lengthened by 3.6 mm to increase the capacity and 41% of the engine's components are new. The engine uses new twin-scroll turbochargers which have a low inertia titanium-aluminium turbines which spin with maximum efficiency with the help of actively controlled waste gates. The engine has a rated power output of at 7,000 rpm, giving the car its name; the maximum torque is at 5,500 rpm. = Suspension = The ProActive Chassis Control II active suspension system used in the 720S is an evolution of the system used in the 650S but is lighter than the previous version. The new system features accelerometers on the top and pressure sensors at the bottom of the dampers in order to precisely communicate to the car's onboard computer the driving conditions in real time in order for optimum suspension settings. The system uses findings from a PhD course at the University of Cambridge. = Chassis = The dihedral doors in open position The carbon fibre tub used in the 720S' chassis is based on the similar principle of the MonoCage unit in the P1 but is lighter than its predecessor. Called the MonoCage II, the tub allows for dihedral doors with large cut outs for easier entry and exit. It also reduces the size of the pillars of the roof, improving visibility for the driver. The same tub underpins the Senna, Speedtail and the Speedtail sports cars. = Interior = The interior is designed to be a blend of modern and race inspired elements. Alcantara and Weir leather upholstery along with carbon fibre trim are standard. A Bowers and Wilkins audio system is also standard equipment. Fixed carbon fibre racing seats are included as an option. The main focus of the interior is the driver and this is reflected by the new digital display behind the steering wheel which retracts to a thin screen to reveal vital information to the driver when the car is in track mode. The touch screen on the centre console is angled away from the driver but vital controls are designed to be in the driver's easy reach. The car comes with two driving modes, default and comfort with the former focusing on an enhanced track driving experience. = Performance = According to McLaren the 720S can accelerate to in 2.9 seconds, to in 7.8 seconds, can achieve a maximum speed of , and has a time of 10.3 seconds. The 720S also comes with Variable Drift Mode, which manipulates the stability control to help drift the car. = Efficiency = McLaren claims class-leading efficiency for the new 720S, with CO2 emissions of 249 g/km and combined fuel economy of ‚Äîboth of these figures represent an improvement of around 10% from the 650S.  Design  Rear view Interior The McLaren 720S features twin-hinged dihedral doors and many design features from the McLaren F1. The headlights hide air vents that funnel incoming air to two small radiators in front of the wheels. The doors feature air channels that direct air to the engine. The rear of the car features thin LED tail-lights similar to those on the McLaren P1, and two round exhaust pipes. The design was inspired by the great white shark, and features a teardrop-shaped cockpit. All of the exterior features result in an improvement of 50% more downforce than the 650S. The interior of the car includes a folding driver display and carbon fibre accents.  Variants  = 720S Velocity = McLaren Special Operations unveiled the McLaren 720S Velocity just one day after the 720S was revealed. It featured Nerello Red and Volcano Red paint scheme, and a carbon fibre bonnet. In addition to those, the wheels are lightweight aluminium painted metallic bronze. The interior has Carbon Black Alcantara trim with red highlights, and carbon fibre accents. =720S GT3= 720S GT3 Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the 720S GT3 marks the beginning of McLaren's outreach to both amateur and professional racing drivers. The car is claimed to have been changed by 90% when compared to the road legal version. The main highlights include the M840T twin-turbocharged V8 engine tuned to race specifications; mated to a 6-speed sequential manual transmission instead of the dual clutch unit found on the road car, a newly developed roll cage, a fixed carbon-kevlar racing seat, a six-point racing harness, a roof-hatch extraction system, along with side- impact foam, all complying to the latest FIA GT3 regulations. The exterior is extensively modified as well and now includes a large fixed rear wing, bigger ram air-intake at the front, different head light clusters and a large rear diffuser. All of the aerodynamic elements have been thoroughly tested and calibrated for maximum efficiency by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which saves the research and development costs of making a full-scale mock-up and testing it. McLaren's main aim with the 720S GT3 was to allow easy accessibility of the car to drivers and teams, not just on driving standpoint, but on serviceability and financial viability as well. Keeping that into consideration, efforts have been made to keep the car as fuel efficient as possible while working with the tyre supplier, Pirelli to allow the car to be able to last endurance races with ease. The 720S GT3 would be available for the general public and racing teams at the start of the 2019 season of the FIA GT3 Championship. = 720S Spider = 2019 Geneva Motor Showalt= Rear view The 720S Spider was introduced in December 2018 as the brand's new open top flagship sports car. Due to the integral roll structure of the monocoque used in the 720S, the Spider did not need additional bracing to compensate for the loss of a fixed roof. The modified monocoque loses the spine running from front to the rear of the car and is dubbed the Monocage II-S. Due to the loss of the roof, the 720S Spider uses traditional dihedral doors. The Spider weighs more than its coup√© counterpart due to the retractable hardtop system. The Spider marks the debut of new 10-spoke alloy wheels and new exterior colour options. The roof is a single piece of carbon fibre and takes 11 seconds for operation, 6 seconds quicker than the 650S Spider. The roof can be operated at speeds up to . The Spider uses the \\"flying buttress\\" as used on all convertible McLaren models. There is an added window on the buttress of the car to increase rear visibility. The retractable window between the roll- over hoops is carried over from the 650S Spider. The engine and the transmission remain the same as the coup√© with the engine generating the same amount of power. The Spider can accelerate to from a standstill in 2.9 seconds, to in 7.9 seconds and on to a top speed of with the top closed. The top speed reduces by with the top retracted. 765LT McLaren 765LT Unveiled on 3 March 2020, the 765LT is a track-focused version of the 720S and the successor to the 675LT as a Super Series Longtail car. The M840T engine is now rated at at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm achieved with a higher- capacity fuel pump, forged aluminium pistons and a three-layer head gasket from the Senna. The top speed is lowered from the 720S's 341 km/h (212 mph) to 330 km/h (205 mph) due to added drag created by the added high downforce parts, although the 765LT weighs 80 kg (176 lb) less than the 720S at 1,339 kg (2,952 lb) in its lightest configuration and has a quicker 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of 2.8 seconds. It also can hit 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 7.0 seconds and complete a quarter-mile dash in 9.9 seconds according to McLaren.https://cars.mclaren.com/en/super-series/765lt/specification The Senna's brake calipers are also available as an extra cost option; McLaren claims these have four times the thermal conductivity as conventional carbon ceramics, while Pirelli Trofeo R tyres are standard. Suspension changes involve a 5 mm (0.2 in) reduction in ride height and the use of lightweight main springs with secondary \\"helper\\" units as well as an upgraded Proactive Chassis Control system. The aerodynamics are redesigned to produce 25 percent more downforce than the 720S, featuring front fender vents, a larger front splitter and a longer active wing element at the rear at the cost of less noise insulation, thinner-gauge glass and stiffened engine mounts. The rear of the car also features a quad-exit full titanium exhaust to distinguish it from the 720S. Production will be limited to 765 cars globally with customer deliveries in October 2020.

She and her husband, Juan Francisco Moncaleano, fled Colombia in June 1912 because of political persecution. They eventually settled in California where they helped establish La Casa del Obrero Internacional (The International Workers' Home), where they both published anarchist newspapers.  Colombia to Mexico  The Moncaleanos ran the Casa del obrero (Worker's House) in Bogota, Colombia. After her husband's arrest in 1911, Moncaleano fled with him to Cuba to escape political persecution. They taught at anarchist schools and raised their children there before the Mexican Revolution motivated them to join the fight to reconstruct Mexican society. While in Mexico the Moncaleanos supported the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM - Mexican Liberal Party) and the anarchists Flores Magon. She published in the newspaper Tierra, a leftist weekly publication. Her husband's arrest and expulsion from Mexico by the Francisco Madero regime in 1912, she followed him to Los Angeles, California.  Los Angeles  In Los Angeles, the Moncaleano's continued their anarchist work. They opened and ran La Casa del Obrero Internacional, where Regeneracion (Regeneration) and Pluma Roja (Red Pen) were printed. She wrote for Regeneracion, publishing her first essays in 1913. She was vocal in the subject of woman's liberation, contradicting the position of the leaders of PML who thought that it was the woman's place to push them into becoming revolutionaries. She demanded that women become revolutionaries. She, like most anarchists, did not believe in national borders or in economic classes. This was part of the political, economic and religious oppression of the people.  Pluma Roja  Moncaleano was the director and editor of the periodical Pluma Roja which published from 1913 to 1915. The motto of the newspaper is as follows: \\"'Ante mi la estrella del ideal. Tras de mi los hombres. No miro atras.' (Before me, the star of ideal. Behind me, men. I do not look back).\\" This newspaper networked with the international anarchist movement while recoding the position women held in society. \\"For Pluma Roja, unquestioned patriarchal authority, upheld by religion and the state, was the target of its red pen.\\" Her articles encouraged women to gain their freedom through knowledge, urging men to convert the enslaved women into anarchist thinkers and criticizing men who fought for liberation while encouraging the enslavement of women. She believed that anarchy was the solution to problems of gender and class.

It is a ground orchid with a single erect, hairy leaf and a single white flower with pale pink stripes. Its short flowering stem distinguishes it from other Victorian spider orchids. After 1933 it was presumed extinct until two plants were discovered in 2009. Description Caladenia pumila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single fleshy, erect, hairy leaf, long, wide, with reddish spots near the base. A single white flower wide and with pale pink stripes is borne on a spike tall. The sepals have thick green or brownish club-like glandular tips about long. The dorsal sepal curves forward and is long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and stiffly spread widely apart. The petals are long and about wide and are arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is white with pale pink stripes and is about long and wide. The sides of the labellum sometimes have a few short teeth and the tip curls under. There are four or six rows of well- spaced pink calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia pumila was first formally described in 1922 by R.S.Rogers and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (pumila) is a Latin word meaning \\"dwarfish\\" or \\"little\\". Distribution and habitat The dwarf spider orchid has only been recorded from grassy woodland near Bannockburn and is only known from two plants. Conservation Caladenia pumila is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. After the orchid was first described in 1922, numbers declined until only two specimens were known in 1933. There were no records of the species from then and the species was presumed extinct. In 2009, two specimens were found in a nature conservation reserve. Efforts are being made to increase numbers. The main threats to the species are habitat degradation, trampling, competition with other species and a lack of genetic diversity.

The album was recorded at Virgin records‚Äô The Manor in Oxfordshire in January 1976 with Scottish musician Ronnie Leahy in the producers‚Äô chair. The album had a double release by Love Records in Finland and Virgin internationally. The track listings were identical but the releases had different art work. Lucky Golden Stripes And Starpose continued the theme of the previous album Nuclear Nightclub in having a pop-rock style. There were however still prog-rock elements to the album and the track Colossus is a stand-out piece of classic 70s prog-rock. The album did strangely not include the single Tramdriver/Wardance' which had been released the previous year. Hopes that it would be added came to pass in 2010 when the whole album including these tracks was re-mastered and re-released on Esoteric Recordings. The album was recorded at the Virgin Manor (UK), January 1976, except \\"Tramdriver\\" recorded at Manor Mobile and Kingsway Studio August 1975 and \\"Wardance\\" recorded at Marcus Music Studio, Stockholm November 1975. Artwork As noted above, there were two versions of art work. The Finnish release had art work by former Wigwam bassist Mats Huld√©n. This depicted a group of US 19th century Cavalry soldiers on horses and with weapons depicting the middle ages. Wigwam were hoping to break into the US market and this hope is more clearly sign-posted on the international release. The cover design by Clive Arrowsmith shows headshots of the band within the US Flag. Reception The album has received mixed reviews.

S. Review: L. L. Thurstone, The Vectors of Mind . Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 42 (1936), no. 11, 790791. http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183499382.  Overview  The Vectors of Mind presents Thurstone's methods for conducting a factor analysis on a set of variables that allow for more than one factor, an important extension of Spearman's unifactor method. Having multiple factors adds significant complications and much of the book is focussed on the problem of rotation. It attempts to solve this problem by providing an objective basis for the rotation factors, called simple structure, and advocates the use of oblique (correlated) factors to achieve a simple structure. The book utilizes his centroid method of factor extraction, which made it feasible to complete the arduous calculations necessary for a factor analysis at a time when fast electronic computers had not even been imagined. This is a predominantly technical book that relies heavily upon mathematical presentations and provides multiple numerical examples. However, the early chapters delve into philosophical questions of the nature of science and present Thurstone's understanding of measurement theory.  Synopsis  Preface. This book extends and presents more formally the findings from the author's Multiple Factor Analysis paper of 1931. The author notes that he only recently learned matrix theory and presumes that other psychologists have had similar limitations in their training. he finds existing textbooks on the topic inadequate and the book begins with a presentation of matrix theory, written for those with undergraduate instruction in analytic geometry and real number calculus. The author expresses indebted to various professors in the mathematics department of the University of Chicago for helping him to develop his ideas. He also expresses appreciation to his computer (a person, Leone Chesire), who also wrote the appendix on the calculations used in the centroid method. He foresees a bright future for the use of factor analysis and expects to see the simplification of the computational methods. He expects factor analysis to become an important technique int the early stages of science. For example, the laws of classical mechanics could have been revealed by a factor analysis, by analyzing a great many attributes of objects that are dropped or thrown from an elevated point, with the time of fall factor uncorrelated with the weight factor. Work by Sewell Wright on path coefficients and Truman L. Kelley on multiple factors differs from factor analysis, which Thurstone sees as an extension of professor Spearman's work. Mathematical Introduction. A brief presentation of matrices, determinants, matrix multiplication, diagonal matrices, the inverse, the characteristic equation, summation notation, linear dependence, geometric interpretations, orthogonal transformations, and oblique transformations. Chapter I. The Factor Problem. Natural phenomena are only comprehensible through constructs that are man-made inventions. A scientific law is not part of nature; it is but man's way of understanding nature. Examples are provided of such man-made constructs from physics. He responds to skepticism from the practitioners of \\"rigorous science\\" that human behavior can ever be brought into the fold of such science by pointing out that there is considerable individuality in physical events even though described by rigorous scientific laws, such as the fact that every explosion is unique. Human abilities are the cause of individual differences in the \\"completion of a task\\". The science of psychology will reduce a large number of psychological abilities down to primary reference traits. Formal definitions are provided for the concepts of trait, ability, test, score, linear independence, statistical independence, experimental independence, reference abilities, primary abilities, and unitary ability. These conceptions constitute a theory of measurement that defines factors common to all tests in a battery-the communality of the test battery-, a specific factor that is unique to one test-the specificity of the test-, and the error variance. Factor analysis can determine the communality of a test, but cannot separate the uniqueness into the specific factor and the error factors. The reliability coefficient is the sum of communality and the specificity of a test. Chapter II. The Fundamental Factor Theorem. The factor matrix post-multiplied by its transpose gives the reduced correlation matrix: this is the fundamental factor theorem. The task of factor analysis is to find a factor matrix of the lowest possible rank (the least number of factors) that can reproduce the off-diagonal members of the observed correlation matrix as close as can be expected, allowing for sample variation. The bulk of the chapter considers mathematical issues, including the rank of a matrix and methods for estimating the commonalities of the correlation matrix (the diagonal elements). Chapter III: The Centroid Method. A computation method is developed for factoring a correlation matrix, which is a symmetric matrix of real elements. After a conceptual presentation of the method, some worked examples are provided, including one with eight variables, and another with fifteen variables that are factored into four factors. The mechanics of the calculations are given in Appendix I, which provides the specific steps in making the calculation (the algorithm). Chapter IV: The Principal Axes. A method is presented for determining a desirable rotation of the orthogonal factors called the principal axes. The mathematical foundations are provided, as well as worked examples. This approach is distinguished from Hotelling's method, which the author feels has limited usefulness to factor analysis. The unrotated solution for 15 psychological tests given in chapter III are rotated to their principal axes. Chapter V: The Special Case of Rank One. Spearman presented factor analysis with a single factor (a matrix with rank one) thirty years, but recent advances have made it possible to extend factor analysis to multiple factors. The shortcomings of Spearman's method of tetrad differences are detailed and the current approach found to be more accurate. A numerical example is given. Chapter VI: Primary Traits. Rotation does not affect the results of the fundamental factor theorem. All rotations result in the same reduced correlation matrix so other criteria must be used to ascertain the best rotation That criteria is \\"simple structure\\". The book presents very detailed criteria for simple structure, but more generally it consists of minimizing the number of loading for each variable and wide variance for loadings of each factor. Realizing simple structure may require uses of oblique (correlated) factors. Three additional criteria are given that define when the simple structure is unique. Graphical-mathematical methods are developed for understanding and defining the structure that reveals primary traits‚Äìthe scientific goal of factor analysis. The prior worked example of fifteen psychological traits is rotated to an oblique simple structure to reveal three intercorrelated primary traits. Chapters VII - X: The remaining chapters explore more specific details and problems that can arise. Chapter VII considers several methods for isolating primary traits, with numerical examples given. Chapter VIII addresses the methodological problems that can arise when the correlation matrix has negative correlations. Though most scientific investigations of primary abilities will entail oblique factors, there are situations where the factors are likely to be orthogonal. Chapter IX looks at techniques for achieving orthogonal rotations. The results of a factor analysis can be used to estimate each individual's score on the primary abilities based upon the individual's scores on the tests. Chapter X presents a method for obtaining the regression weights for estimating primary abilities from subject scores, and well as for estimating subjects scores from the primary traits (for estimating the components of variance of the subject scores).

III: A Method of Determining the Square Root on the Calculating Machine.  Historical context  In 1904 Charles Spearman published a paper that largely founded the field of psychometrics and included a crude form of factor analysis that attempted to determine if a single factor model was appropriate. There was limited subsequent work on factor analysis until Thurstone published a paper in 1931 called Multiple Factor Analysis, which expanded Spearman's single-factor analysis to include more than one factor. In 1932, Hotelling presented a more accurate method of extracting factors, which he called principal components analysis. Thurstone rejected Hotelling's approach because it set the commonalities to 1.0, and Thurstone realized that will introduce distortions to the factor loadings when variables include unique components. Hotelling's method was also limited by the fact that it required too much calculation to be useable with more than about ten variables. A year after Hotelling's paper, Thurstone presented a more efficient way of extracting factors, called the centroid method, which allowed the factor analysis of a far larger number of variables. Later that year he gave his presidential address to the American Psychological Association wherein he presented the results of several factor analyses, including a factor analysis of 60 adjectives describing personality traits, showing how they could be reduced to five personality traits. He also presented analyses of 37 mental health symptoms, of attitudes towards 12 controversial social issues, and of 9 IQ tests. In those analyses, Thurstone had made use of tetrachoric correlation coefficients, a method for estimating continuous variable correlations from dichotomous variables. Tetrachorics require extensive calculations but in early 1933, he and two colleagues at the University of Chicago published a set of computing diagrams that greatly reduce the calculations needed for those coefficients, another aspect of making his method of factor analysis practical with more than just a few variables. His 1933 presidential address was published in early 1934 with the title Vectors of the Mind. It lacked methodological and mathematical details of his technique, which is then the subject of this book. A 2004 conference called Factor Analysis at 100 produced a book with two chapters that document the historical importance Thurstone's contributions to factor analysis. Thurstone's approach to factor analysis remains an important method in psychological research and it has since been used in numerous other fields of study. It is now considered part of a family of methods for analyzing the covariance structure of variables, which includes principal components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.

The present convent was founded in the middle of the 14th century by Toledan noblewoman Mar√≠a Mel√©ndez, and is located near other monasteries of note, such as the monastery of Santo Domingo el Real and the Convent of Capuchins of Toledo.  History  =Historical background= At the beginning of the 13th century, the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula‚ÄîAragon (James), Castile (Alfonso VIII and Ferdinand III), Portugal and Navarre (Sancho el Fuerte)‚Äîprepared the so-called \\"Western Crusade\\" in which the Franks and Bretons also took part. The Crusade spread across the various Iberian kingdoms, creating in its wake a special form of religious spirituality. The first missionary journey by Francis of Assisi to the peninsula led to many Franciscan foundations throughout the territory, so much so that in the General Chapter of Assisi (1217) the Franciscan Province of Spain is established. The Friars Minor, in order to carry out their work, came before the civil and ecclesiastical authorities with the \\"apostolic letters\\" and their simple poverty. In each city they evangelized, founded a convent of the Order and collaborated to prepare the spirit of religious crusade in aid of the monarchs. Their charismatic way of life inspired in many people a desire for evangelical conversion, even reaching the Crown: Ferdinand III of Castile (1217‚Äì1252), was a Protector of the Order, and it seems that he was a member of the Third Franciscan Order (a secular Franciscan order). The King died in 1252, a year before Santa Clara. Spain was the second place, after Italy, to receive the Poor Clares, just as before with the Friars Minor, since the Franciscan ideal attracted men and women alike. The origin of the Poor Clares in Spain dates back to the third decade of the 13th century, around 1227 (during the life of Saint Clare), with a strong expansion throughout the century, with the foundation of a total of fifty monasteries in Spain. =The primitive convent of Santa Mar√≠a and San Dami√°n of Toledo= Saint Clare of Assisi. Fresco made by Simone Martini at the beginning of the 14th century. Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi The first Clares settled in Toledo within the lifetime of St. Clare of Assisi herself. At the time they were known as Dianians, after the first place where the San Damiano convent of Assisi had been established. They settled on the outskirts of Toledo, in the district or valley of Santa Susana, where the Seismological Institute of Toledo and the Santa Casilda Asylum are located, since the Toledan jurisdiction ordered that no monastery or convent be established within the city, due to the scarcity of urban land and the massive agglomeration of its inhabitants. The Danaanites were ruled in Toledo by the Rule of Saint Benedict and were spiritually directed by the Franciscans of the city, although, as the historian Mar√≠a Luisa P√©rez de Tudela pointed out, they lived according to the way of life of Saint Clare. In addition, that primitive convent was placed under the invocation of Saint Mary and Saint Damian. Some authors have stated that it was founded around 1250 with the permission of the archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada; the historian P√©rez de Tudela has pointed out that if this is the case it would have been no later than 1247, the year in which the archbishop died abroad.The historian Mar√≠a Luisa P√©rez de Tudela pointed out in 2002 that the bull given by Archbishop Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada to the foundation of the Convento de Santa Mar√≠a y San Dami√°n of Toledo was preserved until recently in the archive of the convent, although at present it is no longer there.Cfr. P√©rez de Tudela y Bueso (2002), p. 108. The historian P√©rez de Tudela pointed out that the first document in which the convent is mentioned is in the testament granted in 1248 by the Archbishop Juan de Medina de Pomar, who succeeded Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada at the head of the archdiocese of Toledo, and where, along with some convents located in the interior of the city of Toledo, is referred to another of the minor friars located outside its walls: \\"et uni quos est extra muris, quod est Ordinis Minorum\\", which shows, according to the historian, that in 1248 the Poor Clares were already established in the Valley of Santa Susana. The foundation of the convent was confirmed in 1254 by a bull by Pope Innocent IV. In 1345, during the last period of the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile, a new ordinance for the city of Toledo was drafted that forbid anyone from living outside its walls, but P√©rez de Tudela stated that the Toledo Clares could not comply with this provision because of their extreme poverty and their lack of resources to move inside the walled enclosure, and were forced to continue bearing the inconveniences derived from the fact of residing outside the walled. Nuns remained in that place for more than a hundred years. =The Convent of Santa Clara of Toledo= General view of the city of Toledo. In the middle of the 14th century a lady of the Toledan nobility, Mar√≠a Mel√©ndez, who belonged to a Mozarabic family and was married to Suer T√©llez de Meneses, Toledo's chief constable, took the first steps towards the foundation of a convent of Poor Clares in Toledo. Mel√©ndez's husband, Suer T√©llez de Meneses, died in 1360. The historian Mar√≠a Luisa P√©rez de Tudela said that the first \\"legal act\\" of the foundation of the convent of Santa Clara the Real took place on August 31, 1368, during the Castilian Civil War, when Mel√©ndez donated to the Damianite nuns of Toledo and to its abbess Sancha Alfonso the houses of the city of Toledo where the founder lived as the site of a new convent. On January 20, 1370, Mel√©ndez acquired for the convent half of some houses that were next to it and that belonged to a \\"Habibi mora\\". In 1370 a document mentions the existence of the convent of Santa Clara de Toledo within the region of the Church of San Vicente; that same year Mel√©ndez became a nun in the convent, as was recorded in several documents issued between 1373 and 1375. On June 27, 1371, Pope Gregory XI issued in Avignon the Bull Piis devotorum in the name of G√≥mez Manrique, archbishop of Toledo, authorizing Mel√©ndez to found in the city of Toledo a convent of Clarean nuns and to provide everything necessary so that thirty nuns could live in it. The bull also demanded that the church of the new monastery have a bell tower and bells. The abbess Sancha Alfonso committed herself before the Archbishop of Toledo in her own name and in that of her successors to pay the tribute of the Subsidio and of the parochial tenths. In 1373 the convent of Santa Clara was canonically established by the deed of the foundation granted by Mel√©ndez on June 13, by which she ceded to that convent the houses it owned inside the walled city of Toledo and all its possessions so that the Clarisses could build a convent in that city with the capacity to lodge thirty nuns and a sufficient dowry so that the monastery could be maintained with its own rents. On August 3 of that same year Mel√©ndez granted a new deed in which she expanded the foundational dowry she had given to the convent.

A former Premier of the Southern Highlands under the old provincial government system, he was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2007 to 2017, representing the electorate of Imbonggu Open. A Papua New Guinea Party member in his first term, he subsequently switched to the People's National Congress after PNC leader Peter O'Neill became Prime Minister in 2011. He was Minister for Transport, Works and Civil Aviation (2011), Minister for Transport and Works (2011-2012) and Minister for Works and Implementation (2012-2017) in the government of Peter O'Neill. Business career and provincial politics Awesa was educated at Kiburu Primary School and Mendi High School before graduating with a law degree from the University of Papua New Guinea in 1975 and a diploma in management from the Australian Administrative Staff College in 1978. He worked as an executive in business, for the Papua New Guinea Electricity Commission and as provincial secretary to the Southern Highlands provincial government. In 1994, he was elected Premier of the Southern Highlands, following the lifting of a two-year suspension of the Southern Highlands government. However, in 1995, the system of decentralised provincial government was abolished, and Awesa became deputy governor under national MP Dick Mune. He was subsequently sacked from that role by Mune after a series of disagreements. He subsequently returned to business after leaving provincial politics, managing Mendi construction company Global Constructions. In February 2002, he formed the Southern Highlands Peace Commission in conjunction with bishops Stephen Joseph Reichert and Clarence Kavali in an attempt to end tribal fighting that had resulted in more than 120 deaths, and personally headed the initiative. The commission was successful in brokering a four-week ceasefire deal in March and a permanent settlement for the three-year-long conflict in May. He contested the Southern Highlands governorship as an independent at the 2003 supplementary election, held after the 2002 national election failed in the province due to fighting, but finished third behind Hami Yawari. First term in the National Parliament Awesa was elected to the National Parliament in the Imbonggu seat at the 2007 election for the Papua New Guinea Party, and was appointed as the party's deputy leader after the election. In September 2008, he was a lone voice of dissent against large government tax breaks for an ExxonMobil natural gas project. He repeatedly attacked the Somare government for alleged corruption, declaring at a Western Highlands rally in October 2008 that the last five years had been \\"riddled with nothing but corruption\\" and that \\"Satan is the boss of the National Parliament\\" In December 2009, he reportedly declined an offer from Somare to become Minister for Internal Security. He vocally supported a 2010 court decision which weakened the Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates such as to reinstate the right of MPs to resign from parties mid-term and limit restrictions on their ability to vote independently. In September 2010, Awesa shifted to the crossbenches, declaring that he no longer had confidence in Opposition Leader Mekere Morauta. In August 2011, after Somare's ouster, he was appointed to the interim ministry of new Prime Minister Peter O'Neill as Minister of Works, Transport and Civil Aviation, although he later lost the civil aviation portfolio. In this role, he was required to deal with fallout from a series of disasters, including the October 2011 Airlines PNG Flight 1600, a fatal January 2011 landslide and the February 2012 sinking of the MV Rabaul Queen. He was awarded an OBE in July 2012 for service to commerce and politics as a Member of Parliament and Minister for State. During the 2012 election, which he recontested for O'Neill's People's National Congress, he was involved in a number of controversies, with opponents and poling officials claiming to have been threatened by his supporters and an attempt to have him charged with contempt of court for breaching a court order restraining him from interfering with the counting of boxes. In late July, the electorate returning officer declared that his opponent had won, while the Chief Electoral Commissioner declared that Awesa had won, resulting in the returning officer going into hiding with a warrant for his arrest. On 31 July, the standoff was resolved with the Commissioner declaring Awesa elected following legal advice. Second term in the National Parliament Awesa was appointed Minister for Works and Implementation after the 2012 election, losing the transport portfolio. In October 2012, his re-election was challenged in the National Court by opponent Pila Niningi. After the court dismissed Awesa's attempt to have the case thrown out as vexatious, it then shifted the trial from Mendi to Mount Hagen due to threats from his supporters. However, in January 2013, Niningu's challenge was dismissed on the grounds of incompetency, with leave to appeal being denied in April 2014. In his ministerial role, Awesa was faced with addressing a K1 billion backlog in road maintenance, widespread criticism over delays and misappropriated funds for repairing poor-quality roads in Lae, a number of key road projects, including a major bypass in Hela Province, issues of land compensation, and ongoing problems surrounding landslide damage on and blockades of the Highlands Highway by disgruntled protestors. In November 2014, the Ombudsman Commission referred Awesa to the public prosecutor over alleged misconduct in office, which was referred to a leadership tribunal in May 2015. It was alleged that he had \\"unlawfully engrossed a public easement for personal use and in the process denied the public right of access to the easement, causing disharmony and difficulty\\". He was cleared by the Leadership Tribunal in July 2015, after which he blasted the Ombudsman for pursuing \\"trivial\\" proceedings. In November 2015, Awesa was revealed to be a co- director of and significant shareholder in Hornibrook NGI Ltd, which had received a multimillion-dollar contract for the Australian Manus Regional Processing Centre on Manus Island, sparking conflict of interest concerns. He was defeated by Pila Ninigi at the 2017 election.

Founded by Tun Habib Abdul Majid, the Bendahara of the Old Johor Empire, it is the royal house of several Malay monarchies, and branches currently reign in Pahang through the descendants of Abdul Jalil Shah IV, and in Terengganu through the descendants of Zainal Abidin I. The family were originally members of aristocracy that forged strong marriage relations with the family of the ruling Sultans since the times of Melaka Sultanate. The ascendancy of the family as a royal house began in the late 17th century, when the last ruler of Johor from Melaka dynasty, Mahmud Shah II died without a male heir. A cadet branch, the House of Temenggong, is reigning in modern Johor through the descendants of Temenggong Abdul Jamal. History In classical Melaka and Johor Sultanates, a Bendahara was the most important and highest administrative position, serving as the chief of all ministers. As an adviser to the Sultan, a Bendahara was appointed by the Sultan and dismissible only by the Sultan himself. The position is hereditary and candidates were selected from the male descendants of the Bendahara family. The most notable of the Bendaharas was Tun Perak of Melaka Sultanate, who excelled in both war and diplomacy. Another notable Bendahara was Tun Sri Lanang of Johor Sultanate who was an important figure in the compilation of the Malay Annals. The consolidation of Bendahara rule in the Johor Empire originated from the late 17th century, under Tun Habib Abdul Majid. When Mahmud Shah II died in 1699 without a male heir, Bendahara Tun Abdul Jalil, the eldest son of Tun Habib Abdul Majid, became the next Sultan of Johor and assumed the title Abdul Jalil Shah IV. His appointment was accepted by Johor chiefs based on the understanding that the Bendaharas would succeed to the throne if the Sultan died without heirs. During his reign, the eastern state of Pahang was established as a special province of the Bendahara family and ruled directly by the successive Bendaharas of the empire. In 1717, Zainal Abidin, the younger brother of the Abdul Jalil Shah IV, established control over the eastern state of Terengganu with the title of Maharaja. He secured recognition as the first Sultan of Trengganu from his nephew Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor in 1725. Meanwhile, in Pahang, a self-rule was established during the reign of Tun Abdul Majid when the state's status was changed from a tanah pegangan (a fief) to tanah kurnia ('granted land'), thus the ruling Bendahara acquired the title Raja ('king') in Pahang. The allegiance of the Raja Bendahara to the Sultan however, continued, though it weakened in time. =The dismemberment of Johor Empire= During the reign of Mahmud Shah III, the great grandson of Abdul Jalil IV, the Johor Empire at that time was approaching its dismemberment, with Sultan's power effectively reduced to the capital in Daik, Lingga. While the rest of the empire was administered by three powerful ministers, the Bendahara in Pahang, the Temenggong in Johor and Singapore, and the Yamtuan Muda in Riau. After the death of Mahmud Shah III, the empire became further irrevocably divided when a succession dispute among his two sons, gave rise to two centers of power, one in Riau-Lingga, under Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah who was supported by the Bugis nobility and the Dutch, and the other in Johor mainland, under Hussein Shah who was supported by the Temenggung family and the British. On March 17, 1824, the Dutch and the British concluded the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, whereby it was agreed that Singapore and the Peninsula should be the British sphere of influence, while the Dutch confined themselves to the islands south of Singapore. The signing of the Treaty further undermined the cohesion of the Johor Empire and contributed to the emergence of Pahang, Johor and Riau-Lingga as independent states. The breakaway Riau-Lingga Sultanate would exist as a Dutch protectorate until 1911, when it was abolished by the Dutch colonial administration. In Pahang Kingdom, the fourth Raja Bendahara, Tun Ali formally renounced his allegiance to the Sultan of Johor and became independent ruler of Pahang in 1853. Meanwhile, in Johor, Hussein Shah and his son Ali were reduced to puppet monarchs and played a minimal role in the administrative affairs of the state, which gradually came under the charge of the Temenggong and the British. In 1855, Sultan Ali ceded the sovereignty rights of Johor (except Kesang in Muar) to Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim,The Numismatic Circular (1970), pp. 47, 87 in exchange for a formal recognition as the \\"Sultan of Johor\\" by the British and a monthly allowance. Following the secession of Johor, Sultan Ali was granted administrative charge over Muar until his death in 1877, and in most administrative matters, was often styled as the \\"Sultan of Muar\\".Burns, Wilkinson, Papers on Malay Subjects, p. 72 In the end they signed the treaty of AD 1855.

Family tree The current ruling house of Bendahara are the patrilineal descendants of the Hadhrami al-Aydrus clan, an offshoot of Ba 'Alawi sada, that trace their lineage to al-Imam Ahmad al-Muhajir bin Isa ar-Rumi, a descendant of Shia imam Ja'far as-Sadiq, who in turn, a direct descendant of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. In the late 16th century, a descendant of the al-Aydrus clan, Abdullah ibn Shaykh al-Aydarus was among the earliest Arab settlers who served a religious leader in Aceh. The sultan of Aceh at that time, Alauddin Mansur Syah, who is the patrilineal descendant of the Melaka-Perak ruling house, persuaded Abdullah to marry his daughter, and his son Sayyid Zaynal Abidin was born out of this union. Abdullah's son Zaynal Abidin also became a religious leader and migrated to Johor, where he married Tun Kaishi, the granddaughter of Tun Sri Lanang by his son, Tun Jenal. It was from this union, the father of Tun Habib Abdul Majid was born. Therefore, in addition to the Hadhrami descent, the modern Bendahara dynasty are also the matrilineal descendants of the old Bendahara lineage and the old Melaka ruling house. *B.S.M - Bendahara Seri Maharaja *B.S.N.D - Bendahara Seri Nara Diraja *B.S.R - Bendahara Sewa Raja *B.P.R - Bendahara Paduka Raja *B.P.T - Bendahara Paduka Tuan *B.P.M - Bendahara Paduka Maharaja *T.P.T - Temenggung Paduka Tuan *T.S.M - Temenggung Seri Maharaja *T.P.R - Temenggung Paduka Raja References Bibliography   Malaysian royal families . .

Its short and wide forewings are darkly coloured with a faint pattern and have rounded apices and mottled black and brown fringes. The hindwings are an unpatterned dark grey with a uniformly grey fringe. The underside of the forewings is black, that of the hindwings is grey; both hold no patterns. The thorax and abdomen are covered with dark scales, brown in case of the thorax and black on the abdomen. Antennae are simple. G. durrelli can be distinguished from other species in the Politzariellinae subfamily based on male genitalia, from which it differs by the presence of needle-like spines at the apices of the gnathos branches and by the complicated juxta-structure which includes three pairs of lateral processes.

Trump called for a congressional investigation into the matter, and the Trump administration cited news reports to defend these accusations. His initial claims were based on an article on Breitbart News, which cited speculations made by conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch. By June 2020, no evidence had surfaced to support the claim, which had been refuted by the Justice Department (DOJ). Representative Devin Nunes, the then-chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he would investigate the claim. At a committee open hearing on March 20, 2017, FBI Director James Comey stated that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department possessed any information to support Donald Trump's wiretapping allegations. Nunes stated on March 23 that the Trump administration's communications might have been legally monitored during the transition period as part of an \\"incidental collection\\". Intelligence Committee leaders later said they found no evidence to support the claim. The DOJ declared in a September 1, 2017 court filing that \\"both the FBI and NSD confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets\\", and confirmed this in another court filing of October 19, 2018. On September 19, 2017 CNN reported that the FBI wiretapped Paul Manafort before and after the presidential election, extending into early 2017, although the report did not make clear whether Manafort was monitored during his tenure with the Trump campaign from March through August 2016. The CNN report also stated that the Manafort surveillance began after he became the subject of an FBI investigation in 2014. Some commentators cited this report as vindication for Trump's claims, while others noted that it did not confirm the accuracy of Trump's original tweets, and that it is still unknown whether any surveillance of Manafort took place at Trump Tower. Manafort owned a condominium in Trump Tower from 2006 until its seizure by federal authorities following his 2018 convictions. On April 25, 2019, Trump said that his original allegation of \\"wires tapped\\" was not literal, and that he really meant: \\"surveillance, spying you can sort of say whatever you want\\". Trump also said that his allegations were made \\"just on a little bit of a hunch and a little bit of wisdom maybe\\", and that he thought his allegations were \\"pretty insignificant\\" when he made them. In a July 2019 interview with C-SPAN, when asked whether he regretted any of his tweets, Trump said \\"Not much, honestly not much...I sent the one about the wiretapping...and that turned out to be true.\\"  Origin  On November 7, 2016, conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch reported in the right-leaning Heat Street, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had twice sought Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants in connection with its investigation of the Trump campaign's links to Russia. According to Mensch, the first request for a warrant which \\"named Trump\\" was denied in June 2016 and, a second, more \\"narrowly drawn\\" request was granted in October 2016. Mensch wrote that this warrant gave \\"counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia\\", and to \\"look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons\\". Mensch further claimed that the October warrant was granted in \\"connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank\\", and that \\"it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any 'US person' connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men\\". Mensch's article cited reports from two anonymous \\"sources with links to the counter-intelligence community\\". Mensch's original article only discussed e-mail exchanges and did not use the term \\"wiretap\\". On January 19, 2017, The New York Times published an article which used two headlines, with the print headline reading \\"Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides\\" and the article published online with the title \\"Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates\\". The article stated that \\"American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted [Russian] communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\\" The article also noted the uncertainty regarding the scope of the communications, stating: \\"It is not clear whether the intercepted [Russian] communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump's campaign, or Mr. Trump himself.\\" On March 3, Breitbart News, a far-right  website known to publish conspiracy theories,   ran an article by Joel Pollak headlined \\"Mark Levin to Congress: Investigate Obama's 'Silent Coup' vs. Trump.\\" On the previous day, right-wing radio personality Mark Levin alleged that Obama and his allies were conducting a \\"silent coup\\" against Trump, and asked: \\"How many phone calls of Donald Trump, if any, have been intercepted by the administration and recorded by the Obama administration?\\" The claims were labeled conspiracy theories by CNN and The Los Angeles Times. The Breitbart article alleged that \\"the Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services\\". Citing Mensch's November article, Breitbart claimed the existence of a June FISA request \\"to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers\\", and of an October FISA warrant \\"focused on a computer server in Trump Tower\\". Breitbart cited a January 11 National Review article, which speculated about alleged \\"wiretaps\\" of the Trump campaign and their legal ramifications. Like the Breitbart article, the National Review article had also extensively relied on Mensch's piece. Both McClatchy and BBC reported on the existence of an October FISA warrant, as did Mensch. However, these accounts differed substantially from Mensch's story with respect to the scope and purpose of the warrant. They alleged that the October warrant authorized to monitor financial transactions related to Russia ‚Äî not communications. Unlike the derivative accounts in National Review and Breitbart, Mensch's original article did not use the term \\"wiretap\\" (implying voice telephone calls), but only made claims about e-mail exchanged with SVB Bank and the Russian Alfa-Bank. While Mensch did claim the e-mail server was located in Trump Tower, it was likely located in Lititz, Pennsylvania, as Trump outsourced e-mail to Listrak, which operates out of a data center there. Furthermore, The New York Times reported on October 31 that the FBI had concluded that the server traffic could have been explained by marketing emails or spam. Contrary to The Times, Mensch claimed that the server's activity remained suspicious enough to lead the FBI to request the FISA warrant. The Breitbart article was subsequently circulated among White House staffers, and was reportedly given to Trump on the following day, together with his morning newspapers and printouts.  Accusation  = Initial claim = Trump responded to the conspiracy theories in a succession of tweets on March 4, 2017, stating he had \\"just found out\\" that former president Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower during the last month of the 2016 election. He did not reveal he had received his information from Breitbart News and offered no evidence to support his claims. Trump compared the alleged intrusion to McCarthyism and Watergate. Anonymous White House officials told The Washington Post that Trump did not appear to coordinate his comments with other White House officials. = Followup = The White House claimed that reports \\"from BBC, Heat Street, New York Times, Fox News, among others\\" established the president's wiretapping allegation, providing links of these to The Washington Post. In a statement issued through press secretary Sean Spicer on March 5, Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to \\"determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016\\" as part of their investigation into Russian interference in the election. In response, Representative Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, stated that the committee \\"will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates\\". Senator Lindsey Graham stated his willingness to use subpoena powers to find out whether Trump was investigated and what the cause for such an investigation was, if it did occur. On March 15, Nunes reported that the House Intelligence Committee had not found any evidence supporting the wiretapping claim. White House officials gave discordant responses to initial media inquiries about Trump's accusations. Spicer banned cameras in the briefing room at a press conference the following day. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News's Fox & Friends that the president had \\"information and intelligence that the rest of us do not\\", although Spicer later said Conway was not qualified to make that claim.  Extension of claim  During an interview on March 12, Conway told The Record's Mike Kelly that the surveillance could have potentially used hacked electronic devices: \\"You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets ‚Äî any number of ways.\\" She also suggested that Trump could have been monitored with \\"microwaves that turn into cameras\\". Conway later retracted the claim, stating that \\"I'm not Inspector Gadget, I don't believe that people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign.\\" At a March 13 press briefing, Spicer claimed that Trump was referring to general surveillance rather than direct wiretapping. Spicer also said that the White House believed that the Obama administration was responsible for the surveillance, not Obama himself, said Trump's tweet which specifically named the former president. In a March 15 interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News, Trump supported his claims of wiretapping by citing a March 3 interview with Paul Ryan on an episode of Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News and the January 19 New York Times article. While The New York Times article mentioned \\"wiretapping\\" and reported that the FBI was \\"examining intercepted communications and financial transactions\\", it stipulated neither the targeting of American citizens for surveillance, nor any involvement in such surveillance by the Obama administration. Trump's March 15 assertion that the Times' article supported his allegations about wiretapping was deemed \\"false\\" by PolitiFact. On Special Report Brett Baier alleged that the FBI got a FISA warrant in October to \\"start a wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer and Russian banks and it doesn't show up anything [referring to the Trump campaign's alleged links to Russian election meddling], by reporting\\", and asked Ryan: \\"Have you heard that?\\" Ryan responded: \\"Well, again, like I said, none of us in Congress or anybody I know in Congress has been presented with anything to the contrary of what you just said.\\" However, there may have been a misunderstanding between Baier and Ryan throughout the interview, with Baier asking about undue surveillance of the Trump campaign, and Ryan responding that intelligence gathering had produced no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trump. Ryan stated, in response to a question about Trump's March 15 comments, that he had been unaware of any wiretapping allegations prior to his interview with Baier, and that \\"the intelligence committees ... have determined ... that no such wiretap existed.\\" = Allegation of British involvement = During a March 14 Fox & Friends interview, Andrew Napolitano said that \\"Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command\\", using the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to implement surveillance to avoid leaving \\"American fingerprints\\". Napolitano accused Robert Hannigan, who resigned from the GCHQ on January 23, of ordering the wiretap. Hannigan reportedly resigned for personal reasons. Fox News anchor Bret Baier later stated that \\"the Fox News division was never able to back up [Napolitano's] claims\\". Napolitano was reportedly temporarily taken off air by Fox due to the allegations. One of Napolitano's sources was former intelligence officer Larry C. Johnson, who later told CNN that Napolitano had misrepresented the statements he made on an online discussion board. Johnson, citing two anonymous sources, claimed that the GCHQ was passing information on the Trump campaign to US intelligence through a \\"back-channel\\", but stressed that the GCHQ did not \\"wiretap\\" Trump or his associates and that alleged information sharing by the GCHQ was not done at the direction of the Obama administration. On March 16, Spicer repeated Napolitano's claim at a White House press briefing. The following day, GCHQ responded with a rare public statement: \\"Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wiretapping' against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\\" A British government source said the allegation was \\"totally untrue and quite frankly absurd\\". Admiral Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), said he has seen nothing to suggest that there was \\"any such activity\\" nor any request to do so. Former GCHQ director David Omand told Financial Times that \\"The suggestion that [Barack Obama] asked GCHQ to spy on Trump is just completely barking ‚Äî that would be evident to anyone who knew the system.\\" The claim started a diplomatic dispute with Britain. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader in Britain, said \\"Trump is compromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. This harms our and US security.\\" The Telegraph said that two U.S. officials had personally apologized for the allegation. The British government also said that the U.S. government promised not to repeat these claims. The White House denied reports that it had apologized to the British government, saying Spicer was merely \\"pointing to public reports\\" without endorsing them. On April 12, 2017, The Guardian reported that GCHQ (and other European intelligence agencies) had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials, and shared the intelligence with their US counterparts. The communications were obtained through \\"incidental collection\\" as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets, not from a targeted operation against Trump or his campaign. Shortly after FBI James Comey publicly announced the counterintelligence investigation into Russian collusion, Robert Hannigan flew to Washington, D.C., according to The New Yorker: \\"Robert Hannigan, then the head of the U.K.'s intelligence service the G.C.H.Q., had recently flown to Washington and briefed the C.I.A.'s director, John Brennan, on a stream of illicit communications between Trump's team and Moscow that had been intercepted. (The content of these intercepts has not become public.)\\" = Surveillance of Trump associates =  Reports  On January 11, 2017, The Guardian reported that the FBI initially applied for a FISA warrant in June 2016, requesting to \\"monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials\\". This initial request was denied. A source told The Guardian that the FBI then submitted a more narrowly focused request in October, \\"but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation\\". The Guardian article was not cited by the White House in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim. The day after The Guardian report, BBC journalist Paul Wood separately reported that, in response to an April 2016 tip from a foreign intelligence agency to the CIA about \\"money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign\\", a joint task force had been established including representatives of the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the NSA; and in June 2016 lawyers from the FBI had applied to the FISA court for \\"permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks\\". The BBC alleged that the investigation was prompted in April 2016 by a \\"tip\\" from an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States. According to Wood, this application was rejected, as was a more narrowly focused request in July, and the order was finally granted by a different FISA judge on October 15, three weeks before the presidential election. According to the article, the warrant did not name Trump or his associates. On January 18, McClatchy separately reported that \\"the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia\\". The McClatchy article was not cited by the White House in connection with Trump's wiretapping claim. In April 2017, The Washington Post initially reported that the FBI secured a FISA warrant to monitor Trump campaign associate Carter Page in the summer of 2016 ‚Äî later corrected to October 2016, one month after Page had left the Trump campaign. The warrant was reportedly based on the possibility that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government, i.e., Russia. On September 18, 2017, CNN reported that the FBI wiretapped Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, from as early as 2014 through an unspecified time before the 2016 election, and also after the election through early 2017, pursuant to two separate FISA court orders. It has not been confirmed whether Trump's conversations with Manafort were intercepted as part of this surveillance. CNN acknowledged that prior to this disclosure, \\"speculation has run rampant about whether Manafort or others associated with Trump were under surveillance\\". The CNN report noted that it was unclear if Manafort was under FBI surveillance while he resided in Trump Tower. On May 16, 2018, The New York Times reported that \\"The F.B.I. investigated four unidentified Trump campaign aides in those early months...[including]...Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Mr. Papadopoulos.\\"  Analysis  In its March 5 analysis of the reporting that preceded Trump's allegations, The Washington Post stated that \\"the articles all suggest that the FISA requests‚Äîif they happened‚Äîwere done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI\\", and not by the Obama administration. According to The Post, Mensch's article was the only one to have alleged any surveillance of Trump Tower. No major news organizations have been able to confirm Mensch's account, despite prolonged efforts by The New York Times and The Washington Post. This absence of verification, combined with Mensch's reliance on \\"vague\\" and anonymous sourcing to individuals \\"with links to the counter-intelligence community\\", lead The Times and The Post to urge skepticism about the veracity of her account. Some Trump supporters cited the Manafort wiretap report as vindicating Trump's March 2017 tweets. However, David A. Graham of The Atlantic responded: \\"This is not true‚ÄîTrump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered, politically motivated surveillance, for which there remains no evidence.\\" While acknowledging that \\"it does make for a more complicated picture than previously known\\", Graham argued \\"there are reasons to doubt\\" that Trump was even aware of the Manafort wiretap at the time he made his unsupported allegations against Obama. Graham concluded: \\"Insofar as there are parallels between what Pollak, Levin, and Napolitano said and the new story, it looks like luck.\\" Aaron Blake of The Washington Post noted that, according to CNN, lawyers for both Trump and Manafort convinced the two men to discontinue their phone conversations some time after Trump took office: \\"If Trump's lawyers somehow knew about and fought back against the Manafort wiretap, it stands to reason that Trump himself might have been aware of it. ... While we don't know the exact timing of all of this, perhaps this is what Trump was referring to and he, as he is wont to do, exaggerated it.\\"  2019 clarification  On April 25, 2019, Trump said that his original allegation of \\"wires tapped\\" was not literal as he had used quotation marks, saying that he really meant: \\"surveillance, spying you can sort of say whatever you want\\". Trump also said that his allegations were made \\"just on a little bit of a hunch and a little bit of wisdom maybe\\". Trump elaborated that he thought his allegations were \\"pretty insignificant\\" when he made them.  Reactions  There has been criticism of Trump's claim as simply being a \\"dead cat\\", a false allegation against Obama intended to direct media and public interest away from Trump and his team's alleged connections with Russia. According to an April 2019 Politico/Morning Consult poll, 38% of American voters believed Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign was spied on during the 2016 election, with 57% agreement by Republicans and 24% by Democrats.Nolan D. McCaskill Poll: Nearly 4 in 10 voters believe Trump‚Äôs campaign was spied on 04/17/2019 politico.co = From politicians = Most Republicans in Congress distanced themselves from the claim and refused to comment on it, although members of both the Senate and House of Representatives vowed to investigate the matter. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis repudiated the claim in a statement later that day saying: \\"A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.\\" The Wall Street Journal described Obama as \\"livid\\" when he heard about the allegations personally, though other sources said he \\"rolled his eyes\\" and remained more concerned about Trump's conservative and nationalist agenda. When the Obama administration's former press secretary Josh Earnest was asked by ABC News's Martha Raddatz if he could deny that the Obama Justice Department had sought and obtained a FISA court-ordered wiretap of the Trump campaign, he responded, \\"I don't know ... The president was not giving marching orders to the FBI about how to conduct their investigations.\\" On March 23, Devin Nunes stated that communications to and from Trump's presidential transition team may have been intercepted as part of incidental collection. In response, officials in the Obama administration refuted any claims that it had been monitoring the Trump team. Nunes said the surveillance was unrelated to the Russia investigation and \\"suggested the contents may have been inappropriately disseminated in intelligence reports ... for political reasons\\". * See also Later the same day, Nunes said that he did not know \\"for sure\\" whether intelligence committees had actually monitored the Trump team's communications. In September, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice stated that a December 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump transition officials and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) raised suspicions because the UAE allegedly failed to give the Obama administration advance notice of Zayed's visit to the U.S., as is customary. Therefore, to better understand the intent of the meeting, she \\"requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally\\" (or \\"unmasked\\"). According to CNN's Manu Raju, while Nunes implied that such unmasking may have been improper‚Äîan allegation that the Trump administration used to deflect from Trump's original wiretap claim‚ÄîRice's \\"explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump\\". Republican Representative Mike Conaway affirmed: \\"She was a good witness, answered all our questions. I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.\\" In May, attorney general Bill Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Bash to examine unmasking conducted by the Obama administration. The inquiry concluded in October with no findings of substantive wrongdoing. Republican Senator Rand Paul pointed out that a backdoor intercept of Trump's communications was possible. Elizabeth Goitein, a surveillance law expert at New York University, pointed out that backdoor searches of incidental records collected on Americans overseas were allowed by U.S. law. Republican Representative Frank LoBiondo, a senior member on the House Intelligence Committee, speculated on March 20, after Comey's testimony to the Committee, that it was possible there was incidental collection that occurred due to targeting Russian communications, but expressed doubt that there was any evidence that there was such a wiretap. Incidental collection‚Äîalso called backdoor collection by politicians such as Democratic Senator Ron Wyden‚Äîhas been publicly acknowledged by the intelligence community for years. = From U.S. government agencies = On March 4, FBI director James Comey asked the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting Trump's claims. Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said \\"For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign.\\" At a House Intelligence Committee open hearing on March 20, 2017, Comey stated that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department possessed any information to support Trump's wiretapping allegations. On September 1, 2017, a DOJ court filing stated that \\"both the FBI and NSD [United States Department of Justice National Security Division] confirm that they have no records related to wiretaps as described by the March 4, 2017 tweets\\". Furthermore, it said that the Department of Justice and the FBI \\"do not confirm or deny the existence\\" of any other records that are responsive to American Oversight's FOIA request, which was broader than the alleged wiretaps of Trump Tower.

Still, Visbal commented that \\"I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent\\". She modeled the sculpture on two children from Delaware \\"so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl.\\"  History  The statue was installed on March 7, 2017‚Äîthe day before International Women's Day‚Äîby State Street Global Advisors, in a campaign developed by advertising agency McCann New York. SSGA was celebrating the first anniversary of its \\"Gender Diversity Index\\" fund that \\"invests in U.S. large-capitalization companies that rank among the highest in their sector in achieving gender diversity across senior leadership\\". The concept for the statue was developed by Senior Art Director Lizzie Wilson and Senior Copywriter Tali Gumbiner. Wilson and Gumbiner established both the idea for the statue as well as the overall look of the girl using countless moodboards and imagery, which Visbal referenced. Fearless Girl was originally given a one-week City Hall permit that was later extended to 30 days. Later, it was announced that the statue would remain in place through February 2018. Among those advocating for the statue to stay longer was U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York's 12th congressional district, who stated, \\"This statue has touched hearts across the world with its symbolism of the resiliency of women.\\" New York City Public Advocate Letitia James wrote a letter that supported keeping the statue, \\"Fearless Girl stands as a powerful beacon, showing women‚Äîyoung and old‚Äîthat no dream is too big and no ceiling is too high\\". A petition on Change.org asking for the statue to be made permanent gathered 2,500 signatures in its first 48 hours. Efforts to make the statue permanent continued after the statue was granted a one-year permit. In April 2018, after Fearless Girl had been in place for thirteen months, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that both Charging Bull and Fearless Girl would be moved to a location facing the New York Stock Exchange. The move would occur before the end of 2018. The statue was removed from its original location at Bowling Green on November 28, 2018. On the spot where the statue stood was placed a marker which read, \\"Fearless Girl is on the move to the New York Stock Exchange. Until she's there, stand for her.\\" The plaque has footprints where people can stand. The statue was unveiled on December 10 at its new site facing the New York Stock Exchange. Controversies = Juxtaposition with Charging Bull = Di Modica, who installed Charging Bull in 1989, asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploited his work for commercial purposes and altered the perception of the bull. He called Fearless Girl \\"an advertising trick\\" that he wanted relocated. On April 12, 2017, Di Modica and his attorney, former New York Civil Liberties Union director Norman Siegel, challenged city officials who let the Fearless Girl statue be installed. Di Modica said that the statue corrupted Charging Bull artistic integrity by distorting the intent of his statue from \\"a symbol of prosperity and for strength\\" into a villain, and does so for SSGA's commercial gain. Siegel said a lawsuit had not been filed as of yet. De Blasio supported keeping the statue, tweeting that \\"Men who don't like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl.\\" = Feminist concerns = Some women criticized the statue as \\"corporate feminism\\" that violated their own feminist principles.The Sculpture of a ‚ÄúFearless Girl‚Äù on Wall Street Is Fake Corporate Feminism. The bronze statue installed by an advertising firm and a financial firm represents basically everything that‚Äôs wrong with our society. Jillian Steinhauer, Hyperallergic, March 10, 2017The 'Fearless Girl' statue sums up what's wrong with feminism today. Corporate feminism always ends up betraying women‚Äôs struggle for justice. That‚Äôs why this Wall Street- funded sculpture will never be a symbol to embrace. Cara Marsh Sheffler. The Guardian. March 14, 2017 The New York Times columnist Ginia Bellafante called it \\"an exercise in corporate imaging\\" by State Street, which, she wrote, had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice, agreeing to pay more than $64 million to resolve fraud charges for secretly billing clients for unwarranted commissions. \\"Corporate feminism\\", she wrote, \\"operates with the singular goal of aiding and abetting a universe of mothers who tuck their daughters in at night whispering, 'Someday, honey, you can lead the emerging markets and sovereign debt team at Citigroup, and then become a director at Yahoo. Christine Emba, an opinion writer for The Washington Post, wrote that the statue \\"portrays the empowered woman as a child, reinforcing the idea of femaleness as cute and inoffensive‚Äîa child with potential, maybe, but not all the way there.\\" = Other controversies = On May 29, 2017, artist Alex Gardega added a statue of a small dog, titled Pissing Pug (alternatively Peeing Pug or Sketchy Dog), and removed it after approximately three hours. Gothamist reported on March 20, 2017, that masked activists had covered the statue in \\"Make America Great Again\\" apparel and a US flag. They also placed pro-Donald Trump signs on it, including one reading \\"VETS B4 ILLEGALS\\" and another with a drawing of Pepe the Frog. On October 6, 2017, State Street, the company that funded Fearless Girl, paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit from its female and minority employees who alleged the company violated equal pay rights. On February 14, 2019, State Street Global Advisors filed a lawsuit against Kristen Visbal, claiming that she has made and sold replicas of the statue in violation of her contract with the company. The suit claims the artist made at least three unauthorized Fearless Girl reproductions that could damage the company's global campaign in support of female leadership and gender diversity. Court filings reported that replica Fearless Girl statues were selling for as much as $250,000.  Effects  The statue (bottom) facing the New York Stock Exchange in February 2019 As reported by Bloomberg News, analysts from marketing firm Apex Marketing estimated that the statue resulted in $7.4 million in free publicity for SSGA as of April 2017, broken down into $201,075 worth of free radio coverage, $393,047 worth of free social media coverage, $3,115,751 worth of free TV coverage, and $3,729,926 worth of free online/print news coverage. At the 2017 Cannes Lions festival, Fearless Girl won three Grand Prix on the first day of the event alone, in the Glass (which deals with marketing addressing gender inequality) and PR categories, and tying for first in the Outdoor category alongside a campaign by Twitter.

The High Court was divided 2:2 and thus the decision of the Chief Justice prevailed,Judiciary Act 1903 s 23 provided that if the High Court was equally divided, the decision of the Chief Justice prevailed. in what is sometimes described as a statutory majority. at p. 533 per Barwick CJ. Griffith CJ, O'Connor J agreeing, held that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with the minimum wages fixed by a Wages Board under a State law. The case dealt with three issues, (1) whether arbitration was a judicial or legislative function, (2) the position of federal awards in relation to a conflict of laws and (3) the facts necessary to establish the existence of an interstate industrial dispute. Fundamental to the opinions of Griffith CJ and O'Connor J was the reserved powers doctrine, that the powers of the Australian Parliament were limited to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the States. The reserved powers doctrine was challenged by Isaacs and Higgins JJ and ultimately abandoned by the High Court in 1920 in the Engineers' Case.. While Griffith CJ and O'Connor J approached the arbitral function as an exercise of judicial power, this would also be subsequently rejected by the High Court resolving that arbitration was the exercise of a legislative function.. The decision of Griffiths CJ and Higgins J approached the conflict of laws issue on the narrow test of whether it was possible to obey both laws, an approach that was considerably expanded from 1926 by the adoption of the \\"cover the field test\\". The paper dispute, doubted by Griffith CJ and O'Connor J in this case, would become an enduring feature of Australian industrial relations. Background All five High Court judges in 1909 had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution. at [48]-[49]. The conciliation and arbitration power had been a contentious issue in those debates, in which the three inaugural 'federalist' judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ had all opposed the industrial dispute power, while the two 'nationalist' judges, Isaacs & Higgins JJ had supported the power. Mr Kingston at p. 780-1 vote at p. 785, 12 in favour, 25 opposed, including Barton & Griffith. H Higgins at p. 782, vote at p. 793, 12 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 22 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. vote at p. 212, 22 in favour, including Higgins & Isaacs, 19 opposed, including Barton & O'Connor. The case is properly seen as a continuation of unresolved debates from the Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s about the roles of the state and national governments, The conciliation and arbitration power had arisen following the bitter and protracted strikes of the 1890s, particularly the 1890 maritime strike and the shearer's strikes of 1891 and 1894. By reference to this history, O'Connor J characterised an industrial dispute as being characterised as unable to be resolved by ordinary tribunals as it was not about the breach or observance of existing contracts, but rather grievances that had developed under the existing contracts and for securing a new agreement. Prior to 1900 there had been various attempts to legislate with respect to industrial disputes, including South Australia,The Factories Amendment Act 1900 (SA) NSW,Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1899 (NSW) New Zealand,Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894 (NZ) and the United Kingdom.Conciliation Act 1896 (Imp). The passage of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in the Australian Parliament was itself problematic, as Alfred Deakin's Protectionist Party relied upon the support of the Labour Party. The Labour Party sought to amend the Bill to cover State railway employees, and a number of radicals in Deakin's government, including Isaacs and Higgins, supported the amendments and helped bring down the government, with Labour forming a minority government under Prime Minister Chris Watson.. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 was finally passed in December 1904,Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth). The Federated Sawmill, Timber Yard, and General Woodworkers' Union was one of the first unions registered. It was represented by Arthur and applied for an award to be made, seeking to establish the existence of an inter-state dispute by evidence they had served written claims on employers in various states. The majority of employers were represented by Mitchell with one employer represented by Irvine . The first issue in contention was whether there was an industrial dispute that extended beyond the limits of one state. One of the arguments advanced was that the businesses were distinct and were not acting in concert, an argument that passed without any apparent reference to almost all employers being represented by the same lawyers. The second issue was whether there was a genuine dispute, as the union sought to establish the dispute by reference to the service by it of written claims and the non-acceptance by the employers. A third issue concerned the extent to which the Arbitration Court could make an award that was inconsistent with a state wages board determination or a state award. In the High Court NSW intervened, represented by Blacket as did the Commonwealth represented by Duffy . Decision One aspect of the decision on which all judges agreed was that the High Court would not determine hypothetical or abstract question with Griffith stating \\"The questions submitted in the case are to a great extent of an abstract character. In my judgment the provisions of sec. 31 were not intended to allow the submission of hypothetical or abstract questions of law which may never arise for actual decision. Any opinions expressed by the Court on such questions can only be obiter dicta of more or less weight, but having no binding authority\\". Higgins J agreed with the principle, but having formulated the questions stated for consideration, disagreed that the questions were abstract or hypothetical. Higgins J did accept that some of the questions could not be categorically answered as the involved cinsideration of facts that had not been determined. Fundamental to the judgment of Griffith CJ was the doctrine of reserved powers, stating \\"pl. xxxv. is to be construed having regard to the rest of the Constitution, and particularly with reference to the doctrine repeatedly laid down by this Court that any invasion by the Commonwealth of the sphere of the domestic concerns of the States appertaining to trade and commerce is forbidden except so far as the invasion is authorized by some power conferred in express terms or by necessary implication\\". O'Connor J similarly held that the States had exclusive control over industry operating solely within a State. Isaacs and Higgins JJ had rejected the reserved powers doctrine from the moment of their appointment in 1906, a position they maintained in their judgments. =Judicial or legislative function= The view expressed by Griffith CJ, and O'Connor J, was that arbitration was a judicial function, decided in accordance with the law, including state laws. The opposing view was described by Griffiths CJ as akin to a legislative power, was that the ability to settle an industrial dispute was not limited by the effect of state laws, although neither Isaacs J, nor Higgins J, ascribed to the categorisation of the arbitral power as judicial or legislative, instead holding that the state laws did not limit the arbitral power or its exercise. =Conflict of laws= The way in which the Australian Parliament sought to deal with State laws was set out in section 30 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provided that: > 30. When a State law or an award order or determination of a State > Industrial Authority is inconsistent with an award or order lawfully made by > the Court, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of > the inconsistency, be invalid. Isaacs J saw the conflict of laws as the central question to be determined, holding in emphatic terms that \\"The moment we depart from the clear terms of sec. 109 of the Constitution, there is nothing but chaos. That clause and covering clause V. form the keystone of the federal structure, and if they are once loosened, Australian union is but a name, and will reside chiefly in the pious aspirations for unity contained in the preamble to the Constitution.\\" Both Griffiths CJ, and Higgins J, were more circumspect, limiting their consideration on the question of inconsistency to whether it was possible to obey both commands. =A paper dispute= Griffith CJ and O'Connor J rejected the attempt to establish jurisdiction to make an award by way of a \\"paper dispute\\". Griffith CJ held that the term \\"industrial dispute\\" connotes a real and substantial difference having some element of persistency, and likely, if not adjusted, to endanger the industrial peace of the community. It must be a real and genuine dispute, not fictitious or illusory. Such a dispute is not created by a mere formal demand and formal refusal without more\\". Similarly O'Ocnnor J held that \\"the Convention and the British Parliament were dealing with the subject practically, that they had in mind actual differences between employers and employees, differences of the kind which the public interests demanded should be submitted to a federal tribunal. They were thinking of real industrial disputes, not of industrial disputes that existed only on paper, or were got up for the attainment of some other and ulterior object than the settlement of differences between employers and employees.\\" Aftermath The significance of the Sawmillers case does not arise from the dubious nature of its authority as a precedent in that it was a split decision, but rather from the adoption of its reasons by the majority in Whybrow's case (No 1), which also held that the question for inconsistency was whether it was impossible to obey both laws. Because an employer could agree to pay more than the State minimum wage, the Arbitration Court could order the employer to pay more than the minimum. The reserved powers doctrine on which the decision of the majority was based was unambiguously rejected by the High Court in the 1920 Engineers' Case, after changes in the composition of the Court. =Arbitration as a judicial function= The exercise of arbitration as a judicial function was first challenged in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd,. where the majority, Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ held that a judge of a federal court was required to be appointed for life. Because the President of the Arbitration Court was appointed for seven years, the Arbitration Court could not exercise federal judicial power. This raised the issue as to whether the invalidity extended to awards that had been made under the arbitration power. A different majority, Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that the making of an award was not the exercise of a judicial function, these portions of the Act could be severed and that the rest of the Act was valid. From 1926 the Arbitration Court was constituted by judges who were appointed for life and the Court exercised byoth judicial and arbitral functions. In 1956 the High Court held that no federal court could exercise both judicial and arbitral powers. Following this decision the judicial and arbitral functions were separated, with the judicial functions performed by the Commonwealth Industrial Court, now the Federal Court while the arbitral functions were performed by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, now the Fair Work Commission. =Conflict of laws= The judgment of Griffith CJ was criticised by later Chief Justice Owen Dixon as taking a pedantic construction drawn from a verbal formalism. (1955) 29 Australian Law Journal 420 at p 427. The proposition that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with a State law had been reversed in the 1926 case of Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn, with the majority adopting the \\"cover the field\\" test for inconsistency first propounded by Isaacs J in Whybrow (No 1). There was no relevant change way in which the legislation approached the potential conflict between federal awards and state laws, continuing to expressly provide that federal awards should operate to the exclusion of state laws and awards,See for example Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) s 152 Awards to prevail over State laws, awards etc. and instead what had changed was the interpretation of those words by the High Court from 1926. A subsequent High Court explained the approach as follows: > The basis of the application of s 109 to a State law affecting industrial > relations regulated by an award is not that the award is a law of the > Commonwealth within the meaning of s 109 but that the Conciliation and > Arbitration Act constitutes the inconsistent Federal law inasmuch as it > means that an award purporting to make an exhaustive regulation shall be > treated as the exclusive determination of the industrial relations which it > affects. \\"The award itself is, of course, not law, it is a factum merely. > But once it is completely made, its provisions are by the terms of the Act > itself brought into force as part of the law of the Commonwealth\\" at p. 547 > per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Webb, Fulager and Kitto JJ. =Paper disputes= The High Court held in Whybrow's case held that the ambit of an interstate industrial dispute could be established by way of a paper dispute, provided the court was satisfied as a question of fact that the dispute was real and genuine. In the Whybrow case Higgins J had held that of the 23 matters in the log of claims there were only two matters that were genuinely in dispute. In this way the establishment of a paper dispute by serving a log of claims and its counterpoint argument as to whether the dispute was real and genuine were a feature of Australian industrial relations.see at pp. 267‚Äì268 per Mason CJ, Deane & Gaudron JJ, at p. 286 ff per Toohey J and at p. 305 per McHugh J.

Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the In der Maur family held positions of regional administrative authority in the government of Farniwang, later known as Berneck, St. Gallen. A branch of the family living in South Tyrol, von In der Maur auf Strelburg und zu Freifeld, was elevated into the ranks of the lower nobility within the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Bavaria. Prominent members of the family include the Swiss artist Robert Indermaur and the Austrian statesman Carl von In der Maur, who served as Governor of Liechtenstein. Coat of arms of the Austrian branch of the family, In der Maur auf Strelburg und zu Freifeld  History  The In der Maur family originated in the Rhaetian Alps in Switzerland during the Middle Ages, descending from the Alemanni. The surname, from the German language, translates to \\"in the wall\\", possibly referring to a fortress, defensive wall, or a geographic moor. The main branches of the family settled within the territory of the Holy Roman Empire that is now Eastern Switzerland, Southern Austria and Northern Italy. = Austrian branch = In 1479 the In der Maurs who had settled in Habsburg-ruled South Tyrol were granted a coat of arms by Frederick III of the Holy Roman Empire. On 23 October 1491 they were granted another coat of arms by Maximilian II. A third coat of arms was granted to six brothers and three male cousins of the family on 1 August 1586 in Innsbruck. On 6 March 1601 the In der Maurs were elevated to the landed nobility by Rudolf II. On 23 June 1703 the In der Maurs were made barons by Leopold I.https://archive.org/stream/neuesallgemeine11knesgoog/neuesallgemeine11knesgoog_djvu.txt The In der Maurs, as part of the Tyrolese lower nobility, owned a schloss and various Ansitze in Kurtatsch an der Weinstra√üe and Freienfeld. In 1615 Caspar Indermaur funded the construction of the Catholic Chapel of St. Anna at Ansitz Strehlburg, one of the In der Maur estates in Kurtatsch. Ansitz Strehlburg and the Chapel of St. Anna. On 19 October 1813 in Munich, Josef Sebastian Anton Indermauer von Freifeld zu Strelburg was granted noble status as a briefadel in the Kingdom of Bavaria through letters patent from Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The Austrian In der Maurs included the nobiliary particles von (descending from) and zu (resident at) in their surname as von In der Maur auf Strehlburg und zu Freienfeld, referencing two of their principal estates, Strehlburg and Freienfeld, in South Tyrol. The use of nobiliary particles in the surname was maintained until the nobility was abolished in Austria in 1919 and the use of nobiliary particles in the surname became illegal. = Swiss branch = During the Medieval period the In der Maurs were elevated to the burgher class and granted the right to use heraldry. As members of the privileged class, they were permitted to live in fortified stone houses, instead of wooden houses that were typical of the peasant class. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance period, the In der Maurs served in administrative roles in the government of Farniwang (later called Berneck) as Landam√§nner, or chief magistrates of the rural Landsgemeinde. They continued having political and economic influence in the region after the Abbey of Saint Gall gained control, having been granted privileges by the Prince-Abbots of St. Gallen. In 1525, Berneck's population, facing political pressure, converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. By 1532, more than half of the residents had returned to their original religion. The In der Maurs of Berneck, who had adopted the religious reforms of Huldrych Zwingli during the Reformation and became Protestant, chose to remain in the Reformed faith. In 1590 Hans Indermaur, a tanner from Berneck, resettled in Rheineck. Indermaur's house was purchased in the 1700s by the municipality of Rheineck and was converted into an orphanage. The building is now a historic landmark and the house's cellar, once used as a tannery, is now a performance venue. A restaurant in Rorschach, Zum goldenen Fass, was started by Johann Indermaur of Berneck in 1905 and is still owned and operated by the family. The family owns the Maienhalde estate, a winery and vineyard in Berneck. The family also owned a furniture manufacturing company in Goldach for 105 years.  Dutch line  In the middle of the eighteenth century Paulus In der Maur of Berneck (1732‚Äì1805) moved from Switzerland to Schoonhoven, South Holland, the Netherlands, thus creating a Dutch branch of the family. His descendants later settled in Utrecht, Gouda, Rotterdam, and Dordrecht. This line included two prominent organ builders, Johann Frederik In der Maur (1790‚Äì1836) and Johannes Casper In der Maur (1817‚Äì1860). Paulus In der Maur's great-grandson, George In der Maur (1831‚Äì1889), moved to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (present-day Jakarta, Indonesia), where he married and had seven children.  English line  Johannes In der Maur of Berneck (b. 1748), son of Herman In der Mauer (b. 1719) and Anna Schreiberin, moved with his wife Margaretha Oberhausler from Switzerland to England. They had three children; Herman Indermaur (b. 1776), Anna Regula Indermaur (b. 1778), and Henry Indermaur (1788 ‚Äì1848). The English In der Maur line continued with descendants settling in Middlesex and Somerset. In 1952, Minnie Rose Carpenter (b. 1919) of Gillingham, the wife of David George Indermaur, departed from Southampton with her daughters Barbara Catherine Indermaur (b. 1944) and Jean Elizabeth Indermaur (b. 1949) to join her husband in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Mission XI Million is India‚Äôs largest school contact programme that aims to change the perception towards football at the school level in India by reaching out to school administrators, teachers, parents and kids; and explaining to them about how the sport can be played in their schools. The final objective of football becoming a sport of choice in India in the future. The ambitious program intended to engage 11 million school children in football as a lead-up to the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017.  Official Launch  MXIM was launched alongside the official mascot of the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 on the 6th of February 2017 by the Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel and the president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Praful Patel at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The principal objective of Mission XI Million was to create a change of perception among the school communities in India that football can be played at any place, any surface and by any number of kids, contrary to the belief in a large number of areas of the country that only full sized pitch and 11vs11 matches can be football. The intention was to spread this message across the country and to bring gully football into the common knowledge of Indian schools, so that they can start playing football games within their existent infrastructure. Mission XI Million uses the school network and facilities around the country to encourage children to play the game, gain healthy habits, fine motor skills and learn valuable life lessons in teamwork and sportsman spirit. The approach is to work with school principals, sports teachers and coaches together as one unit so that schools could become part of the programme by having their students engage in football activities. Schools were supported, directed and encouraged to make their children play football regularly within their existent facilities and for that basic football equipment (footballs and manuals) were given to each school.  Stages of Execution  = Stage one = To comply with its objective, MXIM had three stage of engagements. The first one was called the seminar, the second one are the in-school activities to be carried out by schools themselves and the last one are the grand MXIM Festivals for kids Seminars: The first stage of MXIM was the reach out phase where school principals, physical education and sports teachers were invited to attend an MXIM designated seminar. The objective of the seminar was to change in all the administrators the perception of football as only an 11vs11 game that could only be played in massive fields. All administrators were encouraged to conduct football games within whatever existent infrastructure they had in their schools, making a big change in the mindset of a large number of schools that never thought that football could be played anywhere or by any number of kids. At the seminars, administrators were told more about the initiative, and exactly how to carry it out within their schools. Post the session, the registered schools, academies or institutions were handed over football equipment and a technical manual to refer while implementing the programme in their schools. = Stage two = The second stage of MXIM entailed in-school activities that were carried out within the institution by the own school teachers and administrators. There were recommendations given as to how carry out games in a small format and what type of drills they could be conducted, that were devised specially by the different stakeholders of MXIM for the programme considering the realities of India. The idea is that the format, devised especially for MXIM, can be adapted to different field conditions available locally. Coaches were required to conduct drills with the children, which have been described in detail in the manual provided. The in- school activities are to be carried ut by the own school administration, with the guidance, encouragement and support of the network of MXIM coordinators and coaches across the country. = Stage three = The third and final stage of the MXIM programme was the Football Festivals. Children from each school are selected to participate in a football festival in the particular city. Football matches, skill contests comprising dribbling, juggling and shooting are part of the grand football festival. Exclusive MXIM merchandise and other prizes were on offer for the students.  Milestones  Praful Patel, President, AIFF at the Mission XI Million festival in AhmedabadMXIM touched the 2,000 schools mark within a month of its inception and Gangtok was the city where Mission XI Million found its landmark of reaching 1 million school students. It also conducted its maiden football festival at the TransStadia Stadium in Ahmedabad on 9 April, which was attended by former Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia, AIFF President Praful Patel and Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan. The programme has reached till date 11,008,561 million kids in all the 29 States and 2 Union Territories. Over 42,200 footballs have been distributed till date to 24,933 schools in 78 cities across the country. Before the India vs. USA match of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on 6 October 2017, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, Sports Minister Rajavardhan Rathore, AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, AIFF President Praful Patel and FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura felicitated the 11 kids who marks each millionth benchmark for the Mission Eleven Million Programme. The match ball used at the match was handed over by Narendra Modi to the 11th Millionth MXIM kid, who placed it on the match ball stand.  Partnerships  Mission XI Million has been designed, conceptualized and it is run by the Local Organising Committee of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017. The LOC partnered with Government of India for full support and outreach for MXIM. Other main partners of MXIM included Adidas, Hero, Bank of Baroda and Sony Networks.

She is the author of Folk Songs of Old New England (1939), considered a valuable scholarly source for American folk songs. John Lee Brooks described Folk Songs of Old New England as an American equivalent of Bishop Percy's 1765 work Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. Life and career Linscott was born Eloise Barrett Hubbard and raised in Taunton, Massachusetts. She was graduated from Radcliffe College in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. Linscott was initially inspired to begin her fieldwork to preserve the legacy of her own family's musical traditions, and because there were then no music books on traditional songs such as she had known as a girl. Folk Songs of Old New England was the culmination of about ten years of work. One important source of Folk Songs of Old New England was a collection of songs which had remained in the possession of the descendants of one Elizabeth Foster Reed for over 150 years, which Linscott unearthed. But Linscott used several other sources as well. Although she continued her research and fieldwork with the intention of publishing other books, Folk Songs of Old New England was Linscott's only publication. However, she gave popular lectures on folk music at music societies, camps, women's clubs, and arts groups, where she would bring a guest fiddler, and sometimes sing. In the 1940s, Linscott became involved with the National Folk Festival as a volunteer coordinator for New England musicians. She helped organize regional folk festivals, including ones held at the Boston Arena and Boston Public Garden. Linscott used her own personal funding to finance the first ten years of her research. Around 1940, she gained sponsorship from Musicraft and in 1941 from the Library of Congress. In 1941, Linscott borrowed equipment from Alan Lomax (head of the Library's Archive of American Folk Song) and in two weeks delivered to Lomax 36 glass-core master acetate discs of folk songs. Lomax was a regular correspondent and mentor to her during this time. Linscott was an enterprising, tenacious, energetic, and enthusiastic fieldworker. One informant bestowed on her the nickname \\"The Tornado\\". Over the course of her career, Linscott gathered approximately 2500 recordings on cylinders, discs, and tapes, as well as other materials. Linscott's manuscripts, recordings, and other materials remain at the Eloise Hubbard Linscott Collection of the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress. Personal life Linscott had two sisters and three brothers. She married Charles Hardy Linscott in 1921; they lived in Needham, Massachusetts, and spent summers in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. Linscott had one son, John Hubbard Linscott, born in 1929.

The group was founded by Ben Hanna and Bill Emerson in 1995 on the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri, in Pocahontas & Pierron, Illinois and was initially associated with the second wave of alt-country music from the region that included Uncle Tupelo, The Bottle Rockets, Son Volt, and Wilco. The current lineup features Hanna, Emerson, and Jack Petracek. They released a trio of albums on their own Milk The Cow label in 1995 and 1996 to favorable reviews with Option magazine saying \\"the band hails from roughly the same geographic territory as the Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt/Wilco juggernaut, though the music tends toward the cerebral more often than the music of those bands\\".Huffman, Eddie. Option. May/June 1997. In 1999, the band signed to Upland Records, a label run by former SST Records co-owner Joe Carducci and ex-Black Flag/Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson. Their first album with Upland, Il Baccio, followed in 2000 and brought the band to national attention marking a shift into more experimental terrain with Jon Fine in the Village Voice describing them as \\"one of America's best bands\\". Tom Ridge, writing in The Wire, described the album as \\"psychedelicized Country rock...deeply fried\\". In 2001, Grandpa's Ghost were awarded \\"Best Eclectic/Uncategorizable Band\\" by the Riverfront Times, hailing Il Baccio as \\"a masterpiece of clashing chaos and inspired beauty\\". The band's next release was a 2CD set in 2001, Stardust and Smog/Early Autumn Waltz with disc one largely acoustic and disc two continuing the experimentation of Il Baccio. Bassist Mark Robke and drummer Pat Kennett departed the band shortly after its recording with engineer Jack Petracek joining on drums. Another two disc set, (The Tumble/Love Version), followed in late 2002, which featured a murkier, noisier sound with one reviewer describing it as \\"an all-out assault on the senses\\". The trio embarked on a national tour with Mike Watt to support the album. From 2004, Grandpa's Ghost began a collaboration with filmmaker James Fotopoulos that would last through the end of the decade including appearances at the Chicago Underground Film Festival with the band playing alongside film projections of his work. A resulting album Music From The Fotopoulos Projects contained excerpts from these performances. Brad Reno writing in Trouser Press said, \\"Highly recommended, but don't listen to it in the dark\\". In 2007, the band released a four disc set collection of this work, Anesthetize the Dissonance of Your Cranium.

Life Born at King's Langley, Hertfordshire, on 21 January 1821, he was eldest of four sons of William Petrie (born 1784), a War Office official, and his wife Margaret Mitton, daughter of the banker Henry Mitton, of the Chase, Enfield. In 1829 his father was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he acted until 1837 as deputy commissary-general, with as neighbour Sir John Herschel, the astronomer, who was a significant influence on the younger William Petrie's interest in science. After home education in Cape Town, Petrie, with his brother Martin, entered the South African College. In 1836 Petrie became a medical student at a hospital in Cape Town, but next year the family returned to London and he went to King's College, London. Later (1840) he studied electromagnetism in Frankfurt. He returned to England in 1841, and took out a patent for an electric generator. Staite-Petrie self- regulating arc lamp, 1847 From 1846 to 1853 Petrie worked on electric lighting problems with William Edwards Staite. He is credited with the invention in 1847‚Äì8 of a self-regulating arc lamp, with an automatic movement of one electrode. He superintended the manufacture of the new lamp at Charles Holtzapffel's works in Long Acre, London. On 28 November and 2 December 1848 Petrie made displays with a lamp of 700 candlepower from the portico of the National Gallery, and on nights in 1849 from the Hungerford suspension bridge in London. The demonstrations were witnessed by Charles Wheatstone, among other scientists. Petrie and Staite's efforts to promote electric illumination were, however, financially disastrous, absent better generators. Subsequently Petrie turned his attention to electrochemistry, and superintended large chemical works; he introduced into the processes improvements which he patented. He also designed and equipped chemical works in France, Australia, and the United States. For many years he was adviser and designer with Johnson, Matthey & Co.. Petrie died on 16 March 1908 at Bromley, Kent, and was buried there. Works Petrie published papers: * Results of some Experiments in Electricity and Magnetism (1841), in the Philosophical Magazine; * On the Results of an Extensive Series of Magnetic Investigations, including most of the known Varieties of Steel, communicated at the British Association's Southampton meeting of 1846; and papers presented to the Association in 1850; * Improvements in the Electric Light, with William Edwards Staite, read before the Society of Arts on 6 February 1850. Family Petrie married on 2 August 1851 Anne Flinders, only child of Matthew Flinders. She was a linguist, and studied Egyptology. Under the pseudonym \\"Philomathes\\" she published a work on the relation between mythology and scripture, and as \\"X.Q.\\" contributed essays to periodical literature. Their only child was William Matthew Flinders Petrie the Egyptologist.

In 2013 Elan won first prize in the Contemporary Issues category of World Press Photo with The Pink Choice and was a participant in the Joop Swart masterclass in Amsterdam. She was selected for the VII mentor program from 2014-2016.  Education  Elan attended the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Hanoi and studied Sociology.  The Pink Choice  In 2010, Elan moved from editorial clients and fashion firms to documentary photography. The Pink Choice focused on homosexual couples in everyday life of Vietnam. She was not sure if she wanted to continue her work collecting photographs of gay couples but decided to keep pursuing the project when she noticed the lack of representation on the subject. \\"None of the pictures she saw revealed the faces of their subjects. Many were shot from the back, and some wore masks. They were stereotypical- even harsh-depictions of love.\\" The previous representation of the LGBT community in Vietnam was almost non-existent and Maika wanted to make sure they were depicted as real people. After being with each couple for a few days, she realized that they were a lot more comfortable showing love in their homes and decided to take all the photographs in private moments at home where they felt more like they could be themselves and not be criticized by the public outside. Homosexual people face homophobia from society and their families in Vietnam, so the display of real people in real relationships is critical. Elan stated, ‚ÄúThe Pink Choice is a series of photos and the love of homosexual couples which focus on living spaces, the affectionate touches, and more importantly, the synchronized rhythm of lovers sharing life together. Viewers may not feel the personalities of the subjects in the photos, but hopefully they can feel the warmth of their love and caring. In way, I wanted to show what I see of homosexual people and not how they see themselves.‚Äù Elan was awarded ‚Äúthe best photo essay‚Äù and the ‚Äúbest single photo‚Äù at the Indochina Media Memorial Foundation, in 2010, for The Pink Choice.

Early life and training Quaile was born in Edinburgh on 28 March 1906, the second child of Ida Sandeman, of the Sandeman port and wine family, and David Renton, a solicitor. She was educated at St Trinnean's School for Girls in Edinburgh where she was Head Girl. In 1927 she began four years of nursing training at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary and was admitted to the Royal College of Nursing in 1932. A believer in continuing education she went on to gain a Diploma in Nursing from the University of London in 1936, received the Central Midwives' Board for Scotland midwife teachers' qualification in 1939, and in 1946, was registered as a Sister Tutor by the General Nursing Council for Scotland.

In 1940 she moved to work at the 2,000-bed emergency war hospital, Bangor Hospital near Livingston. She was appointed matron at the hospital, making her, at that time, the youngest woman in Scotland to hold such a position. In 1946, she was appointed matron of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, remaining there until 1955, after which she took up the position of lady superintendent of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In the hospitals that Quaile oversaw, she implemented changes and efficiencies, including portering services to transport patients to and from wards rather than using nursing staff, actively encouraging the employment of male nurses, advocating for senior staff to live out from the hospital, and seeking improvements to nursing accommodation. Considered a strict disciplinarian with high standard, she was respected by both staff and patients. In 1958 she received an OBE for services to nursing.  Professional activities  Quaile held several professional positions during her career and after her retirement. She was a member of the General Nursing Council for Scotland, and Secretary, and later President, of the Association of Scottish Hospital Matrons, representing the Association at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

It is part of the municipality of Seelitz.  Geography  D√∂hlen is situated in the valley of Aubach brook, about 2 km east of Rochlitz in the Saxon Loess country. The lowest point is at the bridge of Bundesstra√üe 175 across Aubach at about 160 m a.s.l. The terrain rises above 200 m a.s.l. to the north and the south of the village, reaching 229 m on G√∂lprigberg near K√∂ttern and 227 m on Eselsberg near Gr√∂blitz, both outside D√∂hlen. The village, originally an irregular manor settlement with block-shaped land parcels, forms a contiguous settlement with Neutaubenheim, a former manor east of it. Neighbouring villages are K√∂ttern in the north, Neuwerder in the northeast, Sachsendorf in the east, Gr√∂blitz in the south, and St√∂bnig in the west. The hamlet of Neud√∂rfchen is situated between D√∂hlen and K√∂ttern. Bundesstra√üe 175 passes through the western part of the village, climbing out of the valley of Zwickauer Mulde on a steep ramp around Kiefernberg hill.  History  Neutaubenheim manor house in 1860 D√∂hlen has been recorded since 1350, initially under the name Dalen which changed through Doelenn and Doelen to the modern spelling. The manor of D√∂hlen-Neutaubenheim has been known since the mid-15th century. It has been known as Neutaubenheim since the second half of the 16th century and was dissolved in the 1945 land reform. The manor house was demolished, the outbuildings have been preserved. View across the village In 1378 D√∂hlen was mentioned as being under the control of the castle of Rochlitz, and while the manor exercised the local administration, it and the village formed part of Amt Rochlitz and its successors. In 1952, D√∂hlen became part of Kreis Rochlitz in Karl-Marx-Stadt district. In 1969, D√∂hlen with Neutaubenheim was incorporated into the municipality of Seelitz. With Kreis Rochlitz, it passes in 1994 into Landkreis Mittweida and in 2008 into Landkreis Mittelsachsen. In 1893, the Waldheim‚ÄìRochlitz railway line was opened with a station (a halt with a team track and a loading stage) at the western edge of D√∂hlen, on the border to neighbouring St√∂bnig. Construction of the line required the removal of part of Hausberg hill to make room for the road which had to be relocated. This line was closed to freight in 1996, to passengers in 1997, and decommissioned in 1998. Former railway station A schoolhouse was built in 1817. It was used until 1897 when a larger one was opened, and turned into a tailor's workshop. The primary school in the new schoolhouse closed in the early 1970s, and the building was transformed into a kindergarten in 1981. Since 2008, the latter has been administered by a foundation of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony.  Economy  D√∂hlen is characterised by agriculture. The main enterprises are a large fruit farm (Obstgut Seelitz), a fur farm, and a builders' merchant. Public transport is provided by buses to Rochlitz, Geithain, Grimma, and Waldheim.

Biography  Mar√≠a Guerrero L√≥pez was born into a theatre family in Madrid. She was a niece of the celebrated Mar√≠a Guerrero Torija whose stage name she shared. She studied at Madrid's College of Saint Louis of France (\\"Colegio de San Luis de los Franceses de Madrid\\") and made her stage debut in September 1919, while still a child, appearing with the theatre company of her aunt and uncle. That first appearance was in \\"Campo de armi√±o\\" by Jacinto Benavente, in which she appeared at the Teatro Ode√≥n in Buenos Aires. Her Madrid debut followed in February 1920 at the Teatro de la Princesa (as it was then known), in \\"La Dolores\\" by Feliu i Codina. Numerous further roles followed, in plays such as \\"La vidriera milagrosa\\" (1924), \\"Do√±a Diabla\\" (1925), both by Luis Fern√°ndez Ardav√≠n, and \\"Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valc√°rcel\\" (1926) by the Machado brothers. In 1927 she married, as his second wife, her first cousin, Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Guerrero (1897-1942). (His first wife had died in 1919.) Her husband was heir to the family theatre company and by now also father, outside wedlock, of the (later famous actor-director) Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez, although he never acknowledged his paternity. He now produced three more children in his marriage with Mar√≠a Guerrero L√≥pez. Shortly after their marriage the couples' parents (in Maria' case aunt and uncle) died, and they took over the family theatre company, concentrating on classics such as La Estrella de Sevilla and El Perro del Hortelano (The Dog in the Manger, 1931). They also presented several premiers including La florista de la Reina (The Queen's Florist, 1940) by Ardav√≠n. Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Guerrero was killed in 1942 when the ship on which he was travelling was sunk by a German submarine. Maria embarked on a solo career, also sometimes teaming up with Jos√© Romeu. There were notable box office successes in Madrid with productions such as La hidalga limosnera (1944) by Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n, Do√±a Mar√≠a la Brava (1944) by Eduardo Marquina, Sangre negra (1963) by Guillermo Sautier Casaseca and Las de Ca√≠n (1982) by the Quintero brothers.

Early life Underwood was born Marie Therese Augustus in Albury, New South Wales in 1944.Who's Who in Australia, ConnectWeb, 2016. She was \\"enchanted by the magic of words and the power of the pen\\" from a young age. As a child she wrote about swagmen and gypsies saying \\"I loved writing and some of my poems and short stories\\". Some of her early work was published in The Catholic Weekly. Her first introduction to the outback was via her favourite poems, Banjo Paterson's The Man From Snowy River and Henry Lawson's Outback. Through their words, she imagined a place that was evocative, mysterious and compelling. She dreamed of one day living in such a place, ‚Äúmarrying a farmer and penning her own autobiography.‚Äù But Underwood's love affair with the outback was cut short when, at the age of eleven, her family moved to Sydney. Early love In 1963, at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Underwood nursed her future husband, then who had been admitted with a back injury. ‚ÄúSome say he broke his back to meet me.‚Äù A long-distance courtship by correspondence followed after which the couple were married and set out to start their new life in the outback. \\"We celebrated our engagement at the Kimberley Hotel, Halls Creek, and were married in Sydney. Then in a red Bedford truck loaded with six tea chests of wedding presents, we drove for days and days to live in a bough shed on the banks of a dry creek bed.\\" Underwood's early fascination with the outback and her childhood dream to marry a farmer had been realised. She was now \\"a new bride in the middle of nowhere.\\" Life in the Northern Territory In 1968, Underwood and her new husband John moved to Riveren, a cattle station in the Victoria River District in the North-wast of the Northern Territory. Their home consisted of ‚Äúa caravan, a bough shed, camp stove and a tent as the master bedroom‚Äù. In her memoir, Underwood celebrates the close connection she felt with the landscape and station life stating ‚ÄúRiveren has captured our bodies, hearts and spirits. It lies within the heart of Australia. How privileged we are to call it home. Riveren is where I belong. I know it would not have worked anywhere else with anyone else. The middle of nowhere has become my everywhere.‚Äù Underwood saw many changes in agricultural practice during her four decades at Riveren. Riveren was subdivided from the Inverway pastoral lease in 1978. In 1988, Bunda Station was subdivided from the western portion of Inverway. In 2007 John Terry and family purchased Inverway back, but eventually sold both stations to an Indonesian company in 2013.

Early life Ellen was born in Colac to Thomas and Mary Kettle (nee Bicket) and was one of five children. Her schooling commenced in the local small country school and her secondary education was at Colac High School where she traveled to by horse eight miles each way. After completing her general nursing at Geelong Hospital in 1945 and her midwifery training at Townsville Hospital in 1951, she spent six months on Thursday Island, providing health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This prompted her to write to the Director of Health in Canberra to enquire about the opportunity to work in the Northern Territory. Work in the Northern Territory Sister Ellen Kettle immunising Aboriginal people at Kalkarindji in 1957. Sister Ellen Kettle's trunk on display at the Northern Territory Library. Kettle used this trunk to store her papers and as a desk. Kettle commenced nursing on the Aboriginal settlement of Yuendumu about from 300 kilometers from Alice Springs on 2 February 1952, where she was known as Nurse Kettle. She was the first permanent sister to be sent there by the Native Affairs Branch of the Northern Territory. Ellen describes her surroundings after commencing at the Yuendumu Clinic as ‚Äúthere were about 400 desert people, few of whom knew any English and I didn‚Äôt their language. Both the hospital and my living quarters were of unlined wartime camouflaged iron with no electricity or reticulated water‚Äù. In 1954, Ellen was appointed the Commonwealth Department of Health‚Äôs first Rural Survey Sister pioneering mobile health work in isolated areas throughout the Northern Territory, visiting all church missions, Government settlements and large cattle stations. This saw the commencement of a register of Aboriginal births and deaths. Over the next five decades, she almost single-handedly revolutionised Aboriginal health care in the Northern Territory by documenting the health status of Indigenous communities and attempting to draw attention to the plight of Aboriginal health, particularly in regard to the high infant mortality rates. In 1958, she began work on introducing standardised records and weight graphs for infants under five years of age.

She was the first woman to be elected to local council in the Northern Territory. Early life Dean was born in Western Australia and from an early age was interested in photography. In 1914 she was working as an assistant to a photographer retouching and colouring. After doing his job when he took ill one day she was totally committed to photography for her lifetime. She spent time in Sydney before going to New Guinea for seven years. She was evacuated to Sydney when the Second World War began and working as an assistant for a city photographer, Norton Travaire. Over the next seven years she covered an average of 24 weddings each weekend. At the end of the evening, she would ask for the bridal car to drive her home. Photography A portrait of Eric Charles Izod taken by Lillian Dean In 1947 Dean and her colourist Margaret Dewhurst, decided to try working as a travelling photographic team. Arriving in Darwin in 1947 they discovered there was a real need for professional photographers. For the first two years they would do several months of photography and then drive back to Sydney to do the film processing after which they drove back to Darwin to deliver the product. They decided to open a shop in Darwin. Despite white ants destroying one of their cameras before it was unpacked they opened on time and were gratefully welcomed. Their first studio was in an old wartime hut on Daly Street. Initially they had trouble with prowlers, but the installation of floodlights scared off the potential thieves. One was arrested and sent to jail, but returned to the shop upon his release to have his photo taken. She travelled regularly throughout the Territory as a photographer. Dean recounted some interesting and sometimes amusing incidents, like falling into a grave whilst trying to photograph funeral proceedings. When Albert Namatjira came to Darwin and saw the sea for the first time, and then painted it, she was asked to photograph him. Apart from the many weddings she also processed the many photographs that Bill Harney used for his stories of the Northern Territory. She estimated there were around 4,000 of those photos. Dean also specialised in portraits and did many for the Greek population, \\"touching up\\" where necessary. These were often to send back to family in Greece, and in some cases were used where a man was seeking a wife from Greece. Her work also regularly appeared in local newspapers. Eventually Dean moved the shop to Knuckey Street where it remained until she left Darwin in 1971. She also owned land in Fannie Bay. Politics Dean became the first woman to be elected to local government. She served on Darwin City Council from 1958 to 1961, lost the next election, but was re elected in 1966 for a further three years, representing the Fannie Bay area. She was considered an effective and parochial councillor, and was noted for her success in moving that a 25 mph speed limit be enforced over a dangerous section of Gilruth Avenue, which had been the site of many accidents. Dean maintained a keen interest in horse racing and served on the Darwin Turf Club Committee for ten years. She owned and raced a horse named \\"Gentleman.\\" As well, she was a foundation member of the Darwin branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Darwin Bowls Club, and helped establish the Automobile Association of the Northern Territory. She was an active fundraiser for local charities, and friends described her as outgoing, social, strong willed, and determined on issues which mattered to her. Later life Dean retired to Sydney in 1971 after visiting her only child, a daughter, Hazel, in New Guinea. She died on 7 June 1980 at 81 years of age after a long illness. Her ashes were later scattered over Darwin Harbour during a special boat service.

It is a ground orchid with a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf and a single pink flower with a brownish-pink back. The flowers are short-lived and self-pollinating. Description Caladenia pusilla is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf, long, wide. A single flower long and wide is borne on a relatively thick spike tall. The flower is pink with a brownish-pink back and often a white centre. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base but curves forward and is long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide and are partly joined to each other. The petals are long and about wide and spread widely. The labellum is white or pink with red bars and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum sometimes have a few short teeth near the tip which curls under. There are two rows of stalked calli with yellow heads along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November but the flowers are only open for a day or two, sometimes barely open and are self-pollinating. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia pusilla was first formally described in 1980 by Winifred Curtis from a specimen found on King Island and the description was published in The Student's Flora of Tasmania. The specific epithet (pusilla) is a Latin word meaning \\"very small\\", \\"little\\" or \\"pretty\\". Distribution and habitat This orchid is widespread but localised in Victoria where it usually grows in moist coastal heath, sometimes in forests further inland. It grows in similar habitats in New South Wales south from Wellington. South Australian examples are found in the south- eastern corner of that state, especially on the Yorke Peninsula and Kangaroo Island and in Tasmania it grows in coastal areas, including on King and Flinders Islands. In New Zealand it grows in scrub on the North Island. Conservation Caladenia pusilla is listed as \\"rare\\" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

Life In 1752 Belli replaced the castrato Giovanni Bindi who had died in 1750 as secundo uomo in Dresden. That was the beginning of his career. During the Seven Years' War he returned to Italy, and died in Naples at the beginning of 1760, when he was fatally stabbed one day before the premiere of Johann Adolph Hasse's new opera.

He was tall (as all castrati were), lean, with pale complexion, face like an angel and big eyes. As Johann Joachim Winckelmann reports in a letter to his friend on 30 September 1758: \\"In the evening I am going to the opera [....] I am in Dresden, for the Pilaja is singing, and Lenzi and his wife are dancing. The beautiful, indeed the most beautiful, Belli is going to sing today\\"J.J. Winckelmann: Letter to Johann Michael Francke (1717-1775) of 30 September 1758 from Florence, cited from: J. Schultze, H.

Belli remained in contact with Hasse and continued to sing for him.

He is now known for investigations on cholera, which may have anticipated the discovery of the responsible micro-organism by Robert Koch Life Born on 18 October 1819 in Bristol, he was the second son of John Champeny Swayne, a lecturer on midwifery in the Bristol medical school; his mother was the eldest daughter of Thomas Griffiths, an apothecary in Bristol. After education at Bristol college, where one of his teachers was Francis William Newman, he was apprenticed to his father and at the same time studied at the medical school and the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Swayne went on to Guy's Hospital and became M.R.C.S. and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1841. He also studied in Paris, and in 1842 graduated M.B. at the University of London, obtaining the gold medal in obstetric medicine and being bracketed with Alfred Baring Garrod for the gold medal in medicine. In 1845 he proceeded M.D. at London and joined his father as lecturer on midwifery in the Bristol medical school; he was sole lecturer from 1850 until 1895, when he was appointed emeritus professor. In 1853 he was elected physician accoucheur to the Bristol General Hospital, one of the first appointments of the kind out of London; he held this post until 1875, when he became consulting obstetric physician. As a reputed consultant, Swayne had a large practice in the west of England. He was ahead of his time in stressing asepsis, and deprecated long hair or beards for those involved surgery or midwifery. He died suddenly on 1 August 1903, and was buried at Arno's Vale cemetery, Bristol. Works By 1843 Swayne was investigating cholera. In autumn 1849 the Second Cholera pandemic was threatening the city of Bristol, and the Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Society appointed a \\"microscopic committee\\" to look into the disease: it included Frederick Brittan, William Budd and others, as well as Swayne.G. Munro Smith, Cholera Epidemics in Bristol in the Nineteenth Century, The British Medical Journal Vol. 2, No. 2845 (Jul. 10, 1915), p. 60. Published by: BMJ. He described a micro-organism that some have suggested was the \\"comma bacillus\\" which Robert Koch proved to be the cause of the disease in 1884. He took it to be a \\"fungus cell\\", and solicited help with verifying his research from microscopists including Arthur Hill Hassall and Edwin Lankester. George Busk, however, argued that the observation was of a uredo, that is, a fungal plant pathogen. The Royal College of Physicians shortly declared the matter closed.Francis Fowke, On The First Discovery of The Comma-Bacillus of Cholera, The British Medical Journal Vol. 1, No. 1264 (Mar. 21, 1885), pp. 589‚Äì592.

With the advent of the internet, blogs and online magazines have proliferated reflecting the community's multitudinous religious, political, and cultural orientations. AJN and other news sources The primary Australian Jewish news source is The Australian Jewish News (also known as The AJN), a hard copy weekly that also produces a website; owned by Robert Magid and edited by Zeddy Lawrence. Its major rival is an online news magazine, J-Wire, which publishes similar content. It is owned and operated by Henry Benjamin. A recent entry into the market is the free monthly hard copy newspaper, The Jewish Report, which bills itself as a tool for fostering social cohesion.' Literary publications Alongside zines, and other community newsletters, Melbourne Jewry produced two literary journals, the Melbourne Chronicle, in the 1980s and Generation Magazine. The Melbourne Chronicle initially produced a companion Yiddish edition; however, like the Australian Jewish News, which also published additional material in Yiddish, the dwindling Yiddish-speaking market proved incapable of supporting it. After Generation Magazine ceased publication in the 1990s, there was a period in which there was no dedicated publication for Australian Jewish literary expression. In 2009, however, a group of young Jewish writers launched the online magazine, Galus Australis. It billed itself as a pluralist space for the discussion of Jewish Australian ideas and stories, but it ceased publication in 2015. Jewish Women of Words is the newest literary venture in the Australian Jewish media scene. Jewish blogs Australian Jewry's religious and political diversity is best reflected in its blogs. The conservative collective blog, known as Jews Down Under/ publishes opinion pieces arguing from a right wing Zionist perspective; while the Australian Jewish Democratic Society and +61J publish content more critical of the Israeli government. Notable individual blogs have similarly provided the community with a platform for expression. The first such blog, in 2009, to be reported in the wider Australian media was The Sensible Jew, written by Alex Fein. It provided controversial critiques of communal politics. Blogs such as Pitputim and The Fifth Chelek, meanwhile, concern themselves more with religious argument. Radio and television Radio and television have also provided the Jewish community with a broadcast outlet. The long running TV show, The Shtick, first airing on channel 31 and then moving to YouTube, features stories and segments about Jewish life in Melbourne. Melbourne Jewish Radio has also had a long tradition and the SBS station currently provides a service in Hebrew. The community attained a radio licence in 2011 and established the station, LionFM; however, this was short lived as its license was revoked. In its place is the community run radio organisation, J-Air, which bills itself as, 'the Jewish voice of Melbourne'.

Friis was initially a fortification officer and was commanding officer of the Field Telegraph Corps from 1928 to 1932 and of the Military Office of the Land Defence (Lantf√∂rsvarets kommandoexpedition) from 1932 to 1934. In 1934 he was commissioned to build the Swedish Air Force and was appointed Chief of the Air Force, a position he held until 1942 when he retired. Career Friis was born on 1 August 1882 in Malm√∂, Sweden, the son of vice consul Ernst Friis and his wife Sophie (n√©e Thom√©e) and brother of rear admiral Helge Friis (1883‚Äì1956). He passed studentexamen in 1900 and became an officer in 1902 with the rank of underl√∂jtnant the same year. Friis became lieutenant in the Royal Swedish Fortification (Kungliga Fortifikationen) in 1907 and graduated from the Artillery and Engineering College in 1908. Friis was promoted to captain in 1913 and served in the campaign with the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1916. He was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1918 to 1919 and at the Artillery and Engineering College from 1919 to 1921 and served as adjutant to the Crown Prince from 1920 to 1932. He became captain in the General Staff in 1921 and major in the General Staff in 1922. Friis (left) and lieutnant general Per Sylvan in 1940. Friis was head of department at the General Staff's Technical Department from 1922 to 1927 and was lieutenant colonel in the General Staff in 1926 and became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Swedish Fortification in 1928. He was commanding officer of the Field Telegraph Corps from 1928 to 1932 and was promoted to colonel in the Field Telegraph Corps in 1932. Friis was chief of the Military Office of the Land Defence (Lantf√∂rsvarets kommandoexpedition) from 1932 to 1934 and became major general in the Swedish Air Force in 1934. In April 1934, the then Chief of the Air Force major general Eric Virgin applied for a year's leave of absence, after Virgin and the Abyssinia government entered an agreements to which Virgin would function as chief adviser of the reorganization of the country's army. Friis took over as Chief of the Air Force and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1936. Friis was determined to make the Air Force as equal and effective weapon as one of the older military branches. Because of this he needed an Air Staff, which was also created by the Defence Act of 1936. The Air Force lacked a staff and pilot trained officer who could be appointed chief of staff. Friis therefore offered Bengt Nordenski√∂ld this position. Nordenski√∂ld often expressed opinions and criticism in an arrogant and hurtful way. He was often on matters of fact superior to his subordinates and opponents, but he found it difficult to acknowledge others work and listen to their arguments. Thereby he sometimes counteracted the Air Force interests, and he compromised at times that particular work satisfaction and the cohesion he sought. This prompted the defense minister Per Edvin Sk√∂ld and the Supreme Commander Olof Th√∂rnell in 1942 to appeal to Friis to remain as Chief of the Air Force. Although Friis shared Sk√∂ld's and Th√∂rnell's opinion on Nordenski√∂ld, Friis felt that Nordenski√∂ld had to succeed him if the Air Force would be able to keep up with the ever-accelerating development. Friis left the position as Chief of the Air Force in 1942 and was placed in the reserve the same year. He was then governor (st√•th√•llare) of Drottningholm Palace, Gripsholm Castle, Haga Palace, Rosersberg Palace, Stockholm Palace, Str√∂msholm Palace, Tullgarn Palace and Ulriksdal Palace from 1947 to 1962. Friis was standard-bearer of the Orders of His Majesty the King (Kungl. Maj:ts Orden) from 1949 and head of the Royal Djurg√•rden Administration (Kungliga Djurg√•rdens F√∂rvaltning) from 1949 to 1962. Friis became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1924 and was board member of Royal Automobile Club. Personal life In 1909 he married Lotty Salin (1887‚Äì1968), the daughter of professor Mauritz Salin and Bertha (n√©e Kempe). Friis was the father of Birgit (born 1910), Lotty (born 1914) and Bertha (1923‚Äì1997). Friis was the father in law of colonel Sven Thofelt (married to Birgit), doctor Ole Berg (married to Lotty) and count Karl-Hampus M√∂rner (married to Bertha). The Friis' acquired the G√∂rv√§ln House in 1937 where they lived until their death in 1967 and 1968.

His first book, Introducing Christian Ethics (1961), became a standard text in his field. He marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and met with Nikita Khrushchev to set up a college student exchange program with the Soviet Union. Education and early life Barnette was born on August 14, 1911, in Taylorsville, North Carolina. He dropped out of school in the sixth grade and his family moved to Kannapolis, North Carolina in 1925. He converted to Christianity there at the age of 19 and returned to school at age 22 on the advice of his pastor, Wade Jones. He graduated at age 26 and went on to study at Wake Forest College, from where he graduated with honors in 1940. After Wake Forest College, Barnette attended Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (\\"Southern\\") in Louisville, Kentucky, where he received a Masters in Theology and a PhD. He later studied at Harvard University, Columbia University and the University of Florida. Career Barnette's first teaching position was at Samford University (then Howard College), in Birmingham, Alabama, from 1946 to 1947 as a professor of sociology, followed by Stetson University in Florida from 1947 to 1951. In 1951, he joined the faculty at Southern, where he remained until 1977. From 1956 to 1959 he was acting dean of the School of Theology there.

In all, he authored fifteen books. For most of his life, Barnette was a committed Baptist. He first converted to Christianity at the North Kannapolis Baptist Church in Kannapolis, North Carolina. He was ordained a minister in 1935. While at graduate school at Southern he ministered at the Haymarket Mission in Louisville, where he was head of the mission for three years, and was referred to as the \\"Bishop of the Haymarket\\". Later, having moved back to Louisville, he was a member of the Crescent Hill Baptist Church there. Social advocacy Barnette was focused on race as a social issue from at least 1946. He helped to found the Interracial Baptist Pastors Conference in Birmingham Alabama while at Samford. On June 7, 1954, Barnette testified before a subcommittee of Congress in favor of strengthening the role of the United Nations. In 1957, he met with Nikita Khrushchev at the Kremlin and helped establish an exchange program for college students between the United States and the Soviet Union.

It offers a full-time three-year fashion design education, and a variety of short and summer courses. It was formerly known as Margrethe-Skolen.  History  The Scandinavian Academy of Fashion Design (former Margrethe-Skolen) was founded by Margrethe Glad in 1931 and is named after the school's patroness Princess Margrethe of Bourbon-Parma. The reason for SAFD's success was partly thanks to Margrethe Glad's effective social network and her travels to Paris. She first went there to renew her wardrobe, returning later to buy models for manufacturing in Copenhagen. In addition, her language knowledge and pedagogical skills helped her along. In the period when the school was established, interest in courses on textiles was high even at the existing schools but SAFD's education in cutting and sewing elegant fashion designs with an international flavor was something quite new. Similarly, the study tours to Paris she arranged for the school's students were unusual at the time. In 1937, Margrethe Glad moved to Frederiksholms Canal, where SAFD was firmly established in the premises near the beach, and the students learned pattern cutting, sewing and draping based on French haute couture tailoring. After a few years, Margrethe Glad retired from the school, and in 1945, SAFD moved to Badstuestr√¶de led by Inga Madsen, who died in 2008. Thereafter Christina Beckman became director of the school. From 1953 the school was located on √òstergade, but in 2012 it moved back to larger and newer facilities in Badstuestr√¶de. The school officially changed its name in 2017 when Margrethe-Skolen became Scandinavian Academy of Fashion Design (SAFD). SAFD is located in the heart of Copenhagen and has, for more than 85 years, trained many of the leading designers, stylists and business people in the Danish and international world of fashion. Today it is internationally known and respected, according to Createur Erik Mortensen: ‚ÄúNot only having interpreted and taught about fashion, but also having insisted on inspiring students to discover the heart of all forms of creativity, fashion and aesthetics. The school has maintained an admirable level of prestige which is too high for those who intend to accept the easiest solutions.‚Äú Graduates of SAFD have achieved great recognition and success both nationally and internationally. Amongst others, can be named: Margit Brandt, Henriette Zobel, Susanne Rutzou, Bendikte Utzon, Princess Benedikte, Rene Gurskov, Rikke Ruhwald and Bitte Kai Rand. Her Royal Highness Princess Benedikte of Denmark is the school's protector and has established a fund from which the annual Benedikte Prize is awarded. It was an honour and a pleasure when the princess herself graduated from the school and she has kept close contact with the institution since that time.  Mission and activities  Copenhagen campus, student working SAFD's strength lies in its creative approach to education in design. The positive, dynamic and creative atmosphere of the school stimulates the students to develop their personality, originality and individuality. This is a development which, through fundamental, factual and creative studies, endows the graduating student with an ability to realise design projects for industry, brands or their own production. Achieving this result demands exertion and stamina. Students have to endure hard work to gain the basic tools of the trade in order to create new forms and show originality in their designs. They must be clever enough in their sketching to give expression to both creative and technical drawings so that these can be used as guidelines in the process towards the optimal solution. Throughout the education, the students will be challenged to exceed their own limits, to create new forms, materials handling and color combinations. The goal is through craft skills to achieve innovative and new interpretations of what already exists. Through research and design process, the students gets a basic understanding of inspiration, shape and depth, elements which are essential to move forward in the design process. The aim is that the students should be able to combine their natural creative aspect of the art, so the issues that the business will make them can be solved in a highly professional manner. At the same time, it is the students duty to contribute to modern society with innovation, quality and sustainability.  Networks and partnerships  SAFD fashion show during Copenhagen Fashion Week SAFD is a member of the network organization Danish Fashion Institute, which was founded by and for the Danish fashion industry. This means that members are helping to support the vision to strengthen the industry and get Danish fashion positioned internationally. It is also part of a strong network, where the best of Danish fashion are represented. SAFD is also member of Danish Fashion & Textile, also known as DM&T;, has been the industry‚Äôs natural point since 1895, and is today a modern industry and employer organization with insight into members‚Äô daily lives and the challenges that the industry faces.

Exclusive to the Maori Economy, Waikato-Tainui has an Exclusive Economic Zone that covers more than 25,000 km2.  History  The central North Island-based Tainui iwi has a corporate history dating back to 1995, when it settled for a $170 million package of cash and crown-owned land. Tainui subsequently received top-ups to the value of 17 percent of the original settlement.  Investments  =Property Investments= Te Arikinui Hotel On 3 December 2016, it was reported that Waikato-Tainui and Tainui Group Holdings Limited had come to an agreement with Auckland Airport to develop their second hotel near Auckland Airport. The new 5-star hotel will be named Te Arikinui after the mother of King Tuheitia. The Hotel, like the Novotel Tainui, will also be under Accor management, and will be under the Pullman Hotels-brand. As a part of the deal with Accor and the Airport, the Airport has increased its stake in the Novotel Tainui to 50%, with Tainui Group Holdings retains 50%. The Base Shopping Centre The Base is a shopping centre located in Hamilton, New Zealand. The 30 hectare site was confiscated before World War II to build the Te Rapa Air Force Base and was returned to the tribe in 1995. The Base was originally a joint venture with Warehouse Group between 2002 and 2007, before Tainui Group Holdings acquired The Warehouse Group's stake for $37.4 million. In 2009, Tainui Group Holdings is said to have invested $100 million developing The Base and had committed a further $100 million to further developing the shopping centre. In August 2015, Tainui Group Holdings announced intentions to sell up to 50% of The Base shopping centre and use the funds to repay debt and for other investments. Tainui Group Holdings acting chief executive Chris Joblin said, \\"Following a three-month review, we believe that now is the right time to seek an experienced joint venture partner and operator to help us take The Base to the next level of excellence.\\" In April 2016, New Zealand-listed property investor, Kiwi Property Group agreed to buy 50% of The Base shopping centre from Tainui Group Holdings for $192.5 million and offered $197.5 million for the balance. On 16 May 2016 it was confirmed that Kiwi Property will acquire 50% of The Base after Waikato-Tainui turned down the property investor's proposal to buy all of the shopping centre. Hotel Novotel Auckland Airport On 23 July 2009, a joint venture was signed today between Accor Hospitality, Tainui Group Holdings and Auckland International Airport to develop, operate, and manage a 260-room Novotel-branded hotel located at Auckland Airport. The cost was estimated to be roughly $65m including hotel construction, which is estimated to be about $45m. The hotel is expected, and was, to be completed in time for Rugby World Cup 2011. Novotel Auckland Airport was designed by Warren & Mahoney Architects, with the final design to infuse subtle references to New Zealand culture and heritage. Tainui Group Holdings CEO Said, \\"The Airport hotel will also generate considerable long- term economic growth and provide many new jobs for the Auckland region. The hotel will assist Auckland and New Zealand tourism and trade. It will cater for the inevitable economic recovery and growth when it returns.\\" =Ngai Tahu Joint Ventures= Initial Ventures On 26 November 2007, the Herald announced that NgƒÅi Tahu and Tainui had met at Arowhenua Marae in South Canterbury and signed deals to establish formal intentions on 23 November 2007 to work together, using a memorandum of understanding to form a basis to establish a working environment between the two iwi. New Zealand Labour Party MP Shane Jones said, \\"You need to remember that Maori trusts and iwi organisations, they're very rarely sellers. They like to hold assets for a long, long time, and given the amount of foreign ownership in the economy, it's good that tribes work together and help to buy back some of those assets that looked lost.\\" As the first joint-activity of the two tribes, in February 2009, NgƒÅi Tahu acquired 6% of Ryman Healthcare and subsequently on-sold 4.5% to Tainui; raisings its shareholding in Ryman to 8%, and establishing Tainui as a shareholder. Waikato Milking Systems In June 2014, Tainui and NgƒÅi Tahu as well as Pioneer Capital acquired Waikato Milking Systems NZ Limited under a limited partnership, Waikato Milking Systems LP. The partners have stated that they intend to grow the company, either naturally, or by mergers and acquisitions. The company is New Zealand's biggest manufacturer and designer of milking systems, and runs all aspects of its systems, from the stainless steel to the software that helps run the cowsheds. The company, at the time of purchase, had an annual turnover quickly approaching $100 million. All three companies have an equal 33.30% share is the limited partnership. GoBus In August 2014, NgƒÅi Tahu and Tainui purchased GoBus from Australian private equity-firm Next Capial. The total purchase price was $170 million. The purchase is expected to gain approval from New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office due to the company selling GoBus being Australian-owned. In March 2016 GoBus won the rights to operate four South Auckland public bus routes, taking the rights from established Infratil. The contracts commenced in October 2016, and GoBus is supplying 89 buses, most of which are brand new low-emission buses built locally in New Zealand. The company said it would invest $40 million in new vehicles and equipment as well as establishing two new depot facilities, providing over 250 new driver and management jobs. GoBus also provides school bus services, special needs transport as well as some tour and charter services. GoBus has about 360 urban service buses in its fleet of over 1600 vehicles, and employ =Other Investments= Auckland Warriors In October 1998, Tainui invested in the Auckland Warriors for $3.5 million along with a consortium that included Graham Lowe and Malcolm Boyle, under the company Rugby League People Ltd. Waikato-Tainui subsidiary MDC Investment Holdings Ltd owned 66.6% of the RLP in 2000.

He taught at the University of Rochester before joining the faculty at Connecticut College, where he was professor and director of the arboretum. He was a founding member of The Nature Conservancy and served twice as its president.  Early life  Richard \\"Dick\\" Goodwin was born on December 14, 1910, in Brookline, Massachusetts to Harry and Mary Goodwin. He entered Harvard University in 1929 and received his undergraduate degree in biology in 1933. He went on to receive a master's and doctorate degree from Harvard with a concentration in botany. His graduate research focused on the role of plant hormones in the leaf development of goldenrods. At Harvard, he studied under Ralph Wetmore, Merritt Lyndon Fernald, Kenneth Thiman, Irving Bailey, and E. C. Jeffrey. He married Esther Bemis in 1936 and they traveled together to East Africa and the Belgian Congo in 1937 after he received his degree.  Career  From 1937 to 1938, Goodwin was a Fellow of the American-Scandinavian Foundation and a guest investigator in the plant physiology laboratory at the University of Copenhagen, researching plant growth hormones. When Goodwin returned to the United States in 1938, he joined the faculty of the University of Rochester as an Instructor in Botany. In addition to teaching and research, Goodwin managed the university herbarium for six years. Goodwin joined Connecticut College in 1944 as a professor of botany and Director of the Connecticut College Arboretum, replacing George Avery. As Director of the Arboretum, Goodwin spearheaded the acquisition of land that grew the Arboretum from 90 to 420 acres by 1975. Goodwin hired William Niering in 1953 to teach in the Botany department and to supervise ecological research in the Arboretum. In 1969, Goodwin helped create an early Environmental Studies program known as Human Ecology. This program, one of the first of its kind at an undergraduate level in the nation, brought together the study of science and public policy. He headed this interdepartmental major from 1969-1976. Goodwin was awarded the Connecticut College Medal in 1984 and in 1999, the Center for Conservation Biology and Environmental Studies at Connecticut College was renamed the Goodwin-Niering Center for the Environment to honor his work.

She was joined by her domestic partner, Todd Hunter (of Dragon, also ex-XL Capris), on bass guitar and keyboards, and session musicians. They released two albums, So Far 1983-1985 (December 1985) and Pop Art (mid-1986). Scribble disbanded in 1987 with Pigott focussing on her song writing.  History  Johanna Pigott formed Scribble as a synth pop band in Sydney in 1983, the year after her previous group, XL Capris had disbanded. For her new group Pigott provided lead vocals, guitar, piano and keyboards. She recruited her domestic partner (later her husband), Todd Hunter, on bass guitar and keyboards. Hunter was also a member of the rock group, Dragon, and had been her bandmate in XL Capris. 150px In November 1983 the group issued a seven-track extended play, Scribble, on Regular/WEA. Session musicians with Pigott and Hunter were Jeff Oakes on saxophone, Michel Rose on pedal steel and Keith Stirling on trumpet. It provided their debut single, \\"Silly Girl\\", in the same month, with cover art depicting a dark forest and the band's name stylised as bare trees. The track was written by Pigott. Note: User may have to click \\"Search again\\" and provide details at \\"Enter a title:\\" e.g. Silly Girl; or at \\"Performer:\\" Scribble Its music video showed a wistful Pigott singing and playing guitar. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound as \\"winsome, witty pop.\\" Christine Nestel of The Canberra Times opined that \\"[their] first album met with critical acclaim.\\" The group's second single, \\"Adaptability\\", followed a year later in November 1984. The track was co-written by Pigott, Hunter and their former XL Capris bandmate, Tim Gooding; it was used for the theme of a children's TV show, The Cartoon Connection (from 1985). Regular Records released a compilation album, So Far 1983-1985, in December 1985 on Regular/Festival Records. To promote the album Pigott and Hunter assembled a touring version of Scribble with Lee Borkman on keyboards and keyboard bass, Mike Caen on guitar and backing vocals (both ex-Pink Slips), and Tim Powles on drums (ex-Ward 13, on loan from the Venetians). That line-up recorded a studio album, Pop Art, which was issued in mid-1986 via Regular/Festival. Its cover depicts a pop art stylised version of Pigott. Hunter produced the album. Pigott described her preference when performing, \\"Just singing, you can actually concentrate on entertaining rather than playing in tune. When you play and sing you have to concentrate on so many things ‚Äì you're thinking is the amp right, is the mike OK, are you singing in tune. It's a real luxury just being able to relate to the audience without all those things to worry about.\\" By that time the line-up was Pigott, Hunter, Borkman and Caen joined by Neville Anderson (also ex-Pink Slips) on drums, Mark Bell on guitar (ex- Blam Blam Blam, Coconut Rough) and Sandy Chick on backing vocals (ex- Rockmelons). 150px The album had ten tracks, including three singles: \\"Sunday School\\" (April 1986), \\"Don't Give Your Heart Away\\" (July) and \\"Alligator\\" (November) ‚Äì all are co-written by Pigott and Hunter. Pigott's punk nickname from her time in XL Capris had been Alligator Bagg. \\"Alligator\\" was later performed by Fleur Beaupert on the TV drama series, Heartbreak High, episodes No. 133 and No. 145 (Series 6, 1998). The Canberra Times Laurence Boswell declared that their recorded sound was \\"soft and smooth\\" compared with their live show, which was \\"harder and heavier ‚Äî partly due to the guitar work of [Bell].\\" At the end of 1986 the group's line-up was Pigott, Bell, Nicolette Boaz on keyboards, Bill Heckenberg on drums and Geoff Lundren on bass guitar.Scribble and related entries at Australian Rock Database: * Scribble: * Johanna Pigott (1983‚Äì87): * XL Capris: * Lee Borkman (1985‚Äì86): * Mike Caen (1985‚Äì86): * Bill Heckenberg (1986‚Äì87): * Melanie Oxley (1986): * Tim Powles (1985‚Äì86): Hunter had returned to his work with Dragon.

Early life  Reeves was born in Wichita Falls, Texas on June 20, 1940. He retired from the Army in 1985.  First wife  Reeves' first marriage was at 18 to a 15-year-old. The marriage was annulled in 1960.  Manslaughter  Reeves married Sharon Vaughn in 1961. In 1967, while stationed with his wife in Italy, Reeves killed a man and served four months in prison for manslaughter. After his release, the couple returned to the United States and settled in Copperas Cove, Texas.  Second wife  Reeves was married to his second wife for 18 years. They had two sons, Ricky and Randall, while in Italy. In 1977, Sharon pursued an extramarital relationship with John Behneman. She filed for divorce in February 1978 while Reeves was stationed in South Korea. On July 20, 1978, a week after divorcing Reeves, she died of a shotgun wound to her chest that was originally believed to be self-inflicted. The case was re-examined in 1994 and it was determined that she had been murdered. The prosecution demonstrated in court how difficult it would have been for her to shoot herself. A blood spatter expert concluded that Sharon had been wearing a bra and underwear at the time of her death, but when her body was found, she was completely naked. She was 34.  Third wife  Reeves married Myong Hui Chong on Dec. 31, 1980 in South Korea. She drowned in Lake Whitney in Texas in 1986. Her family said Myong was unable to swim and had a strong aversion to water. Bruises on Myong's face made her sister suspicious and she requested an autopsy. Reeves had Myong cremated.  Fourth wife  Reeves met his fourth wife, Emilita Villa, through a mail-order bride service when she was 18. Reeves was 28 years her senior. Emilita was reportedly reluctant to marry him, but felt obligated due to monthly payments Reeves sent to her family in the Philippines. When Emilita became pregnant, Reeves sent her back to her family as he didn't believe he was the father. He changed his mind when she sent him a photograph of their son. She was last seen alive October 11, 1994. She disappeared shortly after telling friends she intended to divorce Reeves. In October 1995, her remains were found by a hunter in a shallow grave near Lake Whitney, where Reeves' third wife had drowned eight years previously.  Investigation and arrest  Emilita's friend reported her missing. The police became suspicious when they found out Reeves had two dead wives, both of whom died after making plans to leave Reeves and after complaining to friends about being mistreated by Reeves. He was arrested on March 21, 1995 for the murder of his second wife and his bail was set at $500,000.  Trial  He was convicted on Jan. 3, 1996 for the 1978 murder of Sharon Reeves and received a 35-year prison sentence. On Aug. 20, 1996, he was convicted of murdering Emilita Reeves and sentenced to an additional 99 years. Reeves appealed against both convictions; his appeals were rejected. His sentences are being served concurrently. He will be eligible for parole in 2026.

It was first established as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College in 1945, transforming into Petroleum and Gas College in 2012. It is the alma mater of many Ukrainian scientists, businessmen and politicians. History =Ukrainian SSR= Drohobych Petroleum and Gas College was founded as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College on January 20, 1945 (Decree ‚Ññ58 of the Ukrainian Government). Since its establishment the school trained over 20 thousand specialists in oil, gas and their refining industry. The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948. Given the increasing demand for industry specialists by Carpathian region companies, college opened a branch department in Boryslav in, 1953. Evening courses were dedicated to specialists training in the fields of \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\" and \\"The technology of oil and gas\\". In 1957 Drohobych Petroleum Technical College was merged with Lviv College of Petroleum Refining. In 1958 college established distance- learning department, conducting training of specialists in the fields of \\"Drilling oil and gas wells\\", \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\", \\"Equipment of oil and gas industries\\" and \\"Chemical technology of oil and gas\\". In 1959 a new branch (evening school) was opened in Dolyna with the following disciplines offered: \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\", \\"Equipment oil and gas industry\\" and \\"Oil and gas industry enterprises planning\\". Due to the decrease in the number of applicants for evening departments, Boryslav and Dolyna branches ceased operations in 1973 and 1975 respectively. =Post- Declaration= In 1997 Petroleum Technical College received a license qualifying it for training junior specialists in the field of \\"Banking\\" and \\"Gas and oil exploitation and storage management\\". Currently, the college prepares specialists in nearly all specialties related to oil and gas extraction and processing. In December 2006, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (Decree ‚Ññ64) accredited Petroleum Technical College as a higher educational institution of the first level and issued its first certificate of accreditation (license serial no. AB482982) granting college the right to provide educational services related to obtaining higher education level qualification \\"junior specialist\\". In August 2012 college was renamed to \\"State Higher Educational Institution \\"Drohobych Petroleum and Gas College\\" (Decree ‚Ññ870 of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine). College today College training is based on primary and secondary education on a full-time, part-time and distance learning basis. Total student population: 1600. Annual college intake ranges from 330 to 400 students. 46 of 99 teaching staff are lecturers of the first category, 7 - teaching Methodists, 3 PhDs, 4 Candidates of Science. The College operates in conjunction with the Ivano- Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas, Kiev Polytechnic Institute and Dnipro State Chemical Technology University. College is also represented as educational consulting office of Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas where alumni may continue their education at university of IV-th accreditation level. The best college graduates can enroll in partner universities for shorter term programmes (3 years instead of 4).

He served in the Republic of China Navy from 1954 to 1997, retiring with the rank of admiral. He was a member of the Legislative Yuan from 2002 until his death. Military career Born Shanghai in 1931, Ku attended both the Republic of China Naval Academy and the United States Naval Academy, and entered the Republic of China Navy in 1954. He became close to Chen Shui-bian while serving as deputy defense minister between 1993 and 1994. As commander of the navy, a post he had assumed in 1994, Ku ended the Advanced Combat System, a program devised in the 1980s by Taiwan to develop a smaller version of the American-made Aegis Combat System. During his tenure, Ku reached an agreement with the United States Navy that allowed the Republic of China Navy use of American rescue vessels, if needed. Political career Ku became the Republic of China's representative to the Netherlands in 1997. Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency in 2000, and due to the friendship between Chen and Ku, it was speculated that Ku would accept an appointment as minister of defense in the Chen administration, a post that went to Wu Shih-wen. After three years as a diplomat, Ku was recalled and expected to retire. However, Ku was named to the People First Party proportional representation ballot in 2001. For accepting the nomination, he was expelled from the Kuomintang. He was strongly opposed to a 2002 proposal to acquire Kidd-class destroyers from the United States, favoring the purchase of Aegis-enabled vessels instead. Ku was critical of a separate plan to buy Standard SM-II missiles for over NT$40 million each. In 2003, Ku published a book about his naval career and joined the Friends of the PFP. The next year, two members of the United States House of Representatives proposed that Taiwan send the Republic of China Marine Corps to engage in the Iraq War, a move Ku believed to be unnecessary. He was involved in another discussion about the cost of arms procurement in October, over a set of special appropriations that cost NT$610.8 billion. Ku was again named a PFP at-large legislative candidate for the 2004 elections, and won. In 2005, he voted against an arms procurement bill that sought to fund a $480 billion purchase of eight diesel submarines along with missile batteries and military aircraft, berating the government for its dependence on the United States. Ku was hospitalized in November 2006, and died of lymphatic cancer at Tri-Service General Hospital on 15 January 2007, aged 75.

Its primary purpose was to demonstrate its wearer's allegiance to the cause of women's suffrage in the UK. Jewellery was a key mechanism used by British suffragists to identify themselves. Gold earrings in suffragette colours  Visual style  The suffragettes, in particular, successfully embraced the language of contemporary fashion - including its emphasis on delicate femininity - as a strategy for increasing the popular appeal of their movement and dodging the stereotype of the 'masculine' women's rights campaigner. As fashion lecturer Cally Blackman notes, \\"Membership numbers grew, and it became fashionable to identify with the struggle for the vote, even if only by wearing a small piece of jewellery picked out in semi-precious coloured stones or enamel.\\" Most suffragette jewellery featured the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) colours: purple, white, and green. There is some disagreement over who designed this visual branding - either prominent WSPU member Sylvia Pankhurst, who had trained at the Manchester School of Art and the Royal College of Art or Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, co-editor of Votes for Women. Association with the suffragette cause became so fashionable by 1908 that Mappin & Webb, holders of royal warrants for jewellery since 1897, issued a catalogue of suffragette jewellery. There appear to have been close links between the suffragettes and the artists of the Arts and Crafts movement.  Known designers  * Sylvia Pankhurst * Ernestine Mills * Georgie Gaskin * Arthur Gaskin * R C Price  Themes  Popular designs for suffrage jewellery included Sylvia Pankhurst's 'Angel of Freedom' design, hatpins in the shape of an arrow to evoke the prison convict's arrow, and badges displaying photos of the WSPU leaders.  Authentication and contested artifacts  Some writers, particularly those focused on the collectors' market, argue that the significance of jewellery as a means of self- identification with the Suffragette Movement is overstated, due to the popularity of these jewellery colours before and after the period in which suffragettes were most active. However, as scholar Elizabeth Goring notes, the purple-white-green colour combination was deeply symbolic of the Suffragette Movement and the use of these colours \\"offered a powerful means by which suffragettes could publicly advertise their identity,\\" and would not be construed as merely decorative by others. The dearth of items identified explicitly as suffragette jewellery in major collections can be partly attributed to the difficulty of using colour alone, without specific date of origin or other documentation, to distinguish this jewellery from other Edwardian jewellery. Association of medals with the Suffragette Movement is more straightforward, and in 2015 the gallantry medal awarded to Mary Aldham was sold at auction for ¬£23,450. The Museum of London permanent collection contains an example of a bespoke piece of suffragette jewellery with clear provenance, created by Ernestine Mills to commemorate the release from Holloway Prison of Louise Mary Eates, Secretary of Kensington Women's Social and Political Union.

She was born on 13 August 1863 in Paris and died in Paris in 1938. She married √âdouard Jacquemin, but later left him to live with the engraver Auguste Lauzet, a friend of Vincent Van Gogh.  Personal life  She married √âdouard Paul F√©licien Jacquemin, a member of Paul Verlaine's circle, on December 13, 1881. √âdouard ultimately abandoned her, and some time later she moved in with the engraver August-Marie Lauzet. Details of her personal life were mired in controversy and misinformation during her lifetime. Leslie Stewart Curtis has claimed that, \\"If Jacquemin and her art have been largely forgotten, it is no doubt related to the infamy she had acquired among her art world contemporaries. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that she was consciously expunged from written records.\\" However, this can also be attributed, in part, to the relatively scarcity of her surviving works.  Career  Information about her artistic training remains unclear. She has been linked to the little-known artists L√©onide Josephine Leblanc, Jean- Charles Cazin, Edouard Pils, and L√©on Bonnat. Jacquemin exhibited approximately 40 works during her lifetime, most of which were executed in pastel and few of which are extant today. She exhibited at Le Barc de Boutteville gallery in Paris between 1892 and 1897, at the Impressionist and Symbolist exhibitions, at the Salon de La Plume and the galerie Bing. In Brussels, Octave Maus invited her to exhibit at the Salon des XX. During her time there, she associated with Georges Rodenbach. At Le Barc de Boutteville, she became affiliated with Alfred Vallette and Remy du Gourmont.  Work  Jacquemin's art was influenced by Puvis de Chavannes, Edward Burne-Jones, Odilon Redon, and Gustave Moreau. Describing the works she exhibited in the 1894 \\"Peintres Impressionistes et Symbolistes\\" exhibition at Le Barc de Boutteville, the critic Ren√© Barjean wrote that \\"the emotional intensity of the faces explored by Madame Jeanne Jacquemin enchants and will always enchant the poets.\\" Her work, like that of her Symbolist contemporaries, addresses mysticism, dream states, nature, and la douleur, or pain. The particular brand of isolation and otherworldliness found in her works coincides with an ambivalent figuration of gender. Her treatment of the \\"female androgyne\\" has been associated with the efforts of female Symbolist artists to explore psychic states \\"not confined to masculine sensibilities,\\" but that do not necessarily put forward a counter-model of \\"essentialized female sensibility.\\" Her portrait of Saint Georges, for example, has been interpreted by some as a self-portrait, due in part to the figure's delicate facial features and long red hair. Her works include: * La Douloureuse et glorieuse couronne (The Crown of Thorns) (pastel on paper, 1892, private collection, Paris) * Le Coeur d'eau (pastel on paper, 1892, Mus√©e de Folklore at Maison Tournaisienne) * Christ √† la couronne d'√©pines (lithograph published in Le Courrier Fran√ßais, Jun 23, 1895) * Saint Georges (color lithograph published in L'√âstampe modern no. 11, 1898) * R√™verie (alternately titled Daydream, M√©lancolie, and Mysteriosa), a signed worm that has been included in several Symbolist exhibitions in recent decades.

Works  Title page of Brihatpingal, published in Devanagari by Gujarati Sahitya Parishad, 1955 Pathak was a prolific writer of criticism, poetry, drama, metrics and short stories, and also edited and translated works of others. Pathak was profoundly influenced by Gandhian thought but retained his originality and literary exuberance. He wrote short stories under the pen name \\"Dwiref\\", poems under \\"Shesh\\" and essays under \\"Swairvihari\\". His literary career began with a critical article, \\"The poems of poet Balashankar Ullasram Kantharia\\", published in the first issue of Sabarmati in 1922. He also wrote literary observations for Yugdharm. Pathak is well known for his Gujarati short stories. He published three volume of short stories entitled Dwirefni Vato (1928, 1935, 1942). His most acclaimed stories are Mukundrai, Khemi and Jakshani. The first of these suggests that modern education degenerates human values; the second is of love between two members of the lower castes considered to be his most memorable characters; the third reflects his subtle sense of humor. His stories are emotionally linked with life. He published a collection of 68 poems, Sheshna Kavyo (1938), expanded to 73 in a second edition (1951). Visheshna Kavyo, his other collection of poems, was published posthumously in 1959.

In his book Politics and the Novel in India, Gopalan V. Gopalan wrote that Pathak's 1937 Aavtikal (Lit. Tomorrow) is characterised by the Gandhian principle of non-violence, trade unionism and the Gandhian ideal of cottage and village industries. But, according to Gujarati Sahityakosh (Encyclopedia of Gujarati literature) Vol. 2, Pathak had never written any novel. According to Gujarati Sahityakosh, the novel Aavtikal, published in 1936, was written by Ramnarayan Nagardas Pathak (1905‚Äì1988), another Gujarati writer associated with Gandhi's satyagraha movement.  Recognition  R. V. Pathak Hall of Gujarati Sahitya Parishad is named after him. Umashankar Joshi honoured him as Sahitya Guru of the Gandhian era and Yashvant Shukla considers him \\"the highest peak of Gujarati short stories\\". He was awarded Motisinhji Mahida Gold Medal in 1943 for his short story Uttar Marg no Lop (1940), Hargovinddas Kantawala Award and Narmad Suvarna Chandrak for Prachin Gujarati Chhando in 1949 and Sahitya Akademi Award for Bruhat Pingal in 1956.

Wollen uses that social media site as a platform for her 'Sad Girl Theory', which includes the notion of sadness as a form of power, and the idea that female sadness and self-loathing might include elements of empowerment. According to Wollen, this empowerment may ultimately lead to women uniting. Wollen uses her Instagram feed as an art gallery where she uses her body in her art by objectifying it and putting herself into famous paintings, among other methods. Wollen describes her work as a methodology of survival, a method for rethinking \\"looking\\" and \\"being.\\" Wollen is inspired by feminist philosopher Judith Butler and Butler's theory of gender performativity. In her artwork, Wollen makes visible the performative aspects of online existence and activity and how identity is constructed. According to Wollen there is no distinct binary between \\"the real\\" or authentic and performance; instead, the artist makes visible how performance is an inevitable aspect of online activities (as well as \\"everyday life\\"), and how subjects are mediated through technology and language.  Sad Girl Theory Sad Girl Theory is the proposal that the sadness of girls should be witnessed and re-historicized as an act of resistance and political protest. Wollen states that girls being sad has been categorized as an act of passivity, and therefore discounted from the history of activism. According to Wollen, political protest doesn‚Äôt have to be external to the body. Wollen emphasizes that historically, girls have used their own anguish and suffering as tools for resistance and political agency. Sad Girl Theory is based on the notion that girls‚Äô sadness isn‚Äôt quiet, weak, shameful or dumb: It is active, autonomous, and articulate. It‚Äôs a way of fighting back. According to Wollen, the re-staging of girls' sadness and self- destruction as an act of political resistance opens up a new history of activism. \\"Revolt\\" might then be understood as something internal, personal and performed on our own bodies, emphasizing girls' agency. Wollen also states that the feminist struggle against patriarchal structures has yet to question patriarchal ideals and masculinist tactics of past revolutions, introducing a redefinition of what violence, activism and autonomy can mean for girls by looking at the actions that are already so pervasive in girl-culture (self- hate, sorrow, suffering and even suicide) and asserting them as scenes of protest. Wollen's Sad Girl Theory can be considered an academic response to the liberal feminist ideal that views women as the makers of their own success. Wollen states that feminism needs to acknowledge that being a woman in a patriarchal society inevitably is difficult and related to oppression and suffering; therefore, it is necessary to view the sadness of girls and women as an appropriate and informed reaction to patriarchal structures. Sad Girl Theory is a criticism of liberal ideals of womanhood that depict \\"the successful feminist\\" as famous, rich and happy. According to Wollen, this idea functions as a second oppression that implies that women who are not happy are responsible for the failure of their own emancipation. Sad Girl Theory provided inspiration for artist and writer Johanna Hedva's Sick Woman Theory, a project focused on chronic illness as an embodied form of political protest. Hedva claims, in response to Wollen's work, that she \\"was mainly concerned with the question of what happens to the sad girl when, if, she grows up.\\"  References  Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Feminist theorists Feminist artists ","title":"Audrey Wollen"},{"id":"53421339","text":"Synevyr National Nature Park () is one of National Parks in Ukraine, located in Zakarpattia Oblast, in southwest of the country.

It was founded in 1890 by Jules Wagemans in Maastricht, The Netherlands. Since 1998, Artifort is a Lande Group brand. The headquarters is located in Schijndel. The furniture is made in- house at the production-units in Schijndel, Lanaken, Belgium and Bursa, Turkey. Artifort furniture is known for its organic shapes, upholstery and is sold worldwide both in the contract and residential market. History In 1890 Jules Wagemans set up his upholstery business in Maastricht. His son Henricus Wagemans built this company up to furniture manufacturer ‚ÄòH. Wagemans & Van Tuinen‚Äô. In 1928, the brand name Artifort is introduced, which combines Art and Comfort.Artifort Interieur Design, Whoppah. Artifort‚Äôs breakthrough came in the 1930s when the company started to use Epeda interior springing. The springing is woven from one single steel wire which increases comfort, is more sustainable and saves production time. Initially Artifort made classic wooden furniture. In the 1950s Artifort took its first step along the path of innovative design with the Pingu√Øn and Congo chair designed by Theo Ruth. In 1958 Kho Liang Ie was appointed as aesthetic consultant. His vision, expertise and international network were determining factors in the successes of the 1960s and 1970s. Kho Liang Ie designs the new Artifort logo and recruits designers Pierre Paulin and Geoffrey D. Harcourt. Pierre Paulin introduces new production techniques and uses brightly colored stretch fabric to upholster the organic shapes of his designs. Paulin‚Äôs focus lay primarily with the challenge of addressing functionality and comfort, most notably showcased with his Mushroom chair, developed for Artifort in 1959 and now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Geoffrey Harcourt designs an extensive collection for the contract market that is very successful around the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, Nel Verschuuren, Bruno Ninaber van Eyben, Gijs Bakker and Jeremy Harvey create designs for Artifort. In the 1990s Artifort continued to collaborate with international designers like Jasper Morrison, Wolfgang Mezger, Ren√© Holten and Jan Pesman. In the 1990s, Artifort was acquired thrice. In 1990 by Steelcase Strafor, in 1994 by Samas and in 1998 by Lande Group. Today Artifort is still a Lande Group brand. In the 2000s and beyond, Artifort continued to collaborate with the next generation of international designers like Patrick Norguet and Claesson Koivisto Rune.

This natural arch is less well- known than the Azure Window, which collapsed in March 2017 following a heavy storm. Location The Wied il-Mielah Window is at the end of the Wied il- Mielah Valley and is, unlike the more known Azure Window, on the west coast of Gozo. The road from Gƒßarb leads directly to the coast; parking is available on the plateau on natural ground. Directly at the end of the valley, parallel to the old river bed, there is a narrow staircase along the rock to just before the window, almost to the water. Since the ceiling of the window is still thick, you can still enter the window above. Environment The north coast from Gozo to the Xwejni Bay is characterized by a plateau, with steep cliffs, which slope down into the sea, where are many caves. On the plateau, artificial salt pans were used to extract salt from the seawater by evaporation. The hinterland rises slowly here, there is Gƒßarb and the lighthouse Giordan Lighthouse.

Life  Born Lucy Brightman in Islington, London, on 22 March 1846, to Benjamin (a butcher) and Abigail (n√©e McNamara). It is believed that Lucy attended boarding school and later became a governess. Between 1847 and 1869, Benjamin and Abigail Brightman ran a coffee house and cafe in Duke Street, and then from 1874-1881 at King Street, Portman Square. In 1876, Lucy married pharmacist Henry Peck. They lived at 6 Derby Street, St Pancras, and they had two children: Ethel Frances Lucy (born August 1877) and Howard (born 1882). = The Dolls' Home Shop = In 1893, Lucy Peck established the now famous Dolls' Home shop at 131 Regent Street. She had previously had a Dolls' Warehouse at 5 Goodge Street from 1890 to 1892. The Peck family lived in apartments over the Regent Street shop. Lucy Peck's surviving notebooks record her methods for casting in Plaster of Paris and Modelling Wax. Lucy Peck specialised in portraits of Queen Victoria as a young girl, modelled after painted portraits. She created play dolls, with wire mechanisms for moving the eyes. She also created fashionable Victorian figures, with layers of clothing including lace petticoats and corsets, and accessories such as umbrellas and fans. The lease on the shop expired in 1908, and the Peck family moved to 162 Shepherd's Bush Road. The Dolls' Home re-opened at 215 High Street, Kensington, where Lucy Peck sold a large range of toys including automata, dolls prams, stuffed toys, dolls' houses and lanterns. Many of her toys and novelties such as Easter Eggs and printed cards were imported from Germany. Her stock included Jumeau dolls, Lehmann clockwork Ostriches and goo-goo dolls. Despite high turnover, Lucy Peck recorded profits of only ¬£2 per week. As well as making her own dolls, Lucy Peck employed other prestigious dollmakers, including Richard Montanari, whose parents had won medals at the 1851 Great Exhibition. By 1914, the shop had moved again to 81 Wigmore Street as a Dolls' Warehouse. After 1918, Peck established a Dolls' Hospital at 306 Earls Court Road. By this time, wax dolls were less popular (bisque dolls were more in demand), and so the demand had shifted from new production to restoration of old items. By 1922, Lucy Peck was retired, and lived in Wimbledon and then Kingston, where she took up clay modelling at Kingston School of Art. She died on October 20, 1930.

In her lifetime, she exhibited in Stills Gallery, Edinburgh; Mercury Gallery, London; The Corridor Gallery, Fife; Pearce Institute, Glasgow; and First of May Gallery, Edinburgh.  Early life and education  Franki Raffles was born in Salford on 17 October 1955. Her parents were Eric and Gillian Raffles (n√©e Posnansky). She had two older sisters, Sally and Emma, and a younger brother, Hugh. Her father managed the E Raffles and Co. textile factory, which had been established by her grandfather. In 1963 the family moved to London where Raffles was educated at Lady Eleanor Holles School. As a teenager she was active in Jewish Youth organisations and aged fifteen she joined a trip to the Soviet Union visiting Moscow and Leningrad. In the summer of 1973, after leaving school and before university, she spent several months in Israel working as a swimming pool lifeguard in Tel Aviv. In September 1973 Raffles took up a place at the University of St Andrews to study philosophy. During her time at St Andrews she was active in the Women's liberation movement and she held strong feminist views for the rest of her life. In 1976, she became the second student ever, and the first female student, to seek nomination for the Rectorship of the University - she was however unexpectedly disqualified for submitting her nomination seven minutes late. Her disqualification was upheld despite all other candidates offering to stand down in favour of a new deadline. She graduated MA (Hons) Moral Philosophy in 1977.  Career  In 1978, Raffles moved to the Isle of Lewis to renovate a derelict farmhouse in the village of Callanish. It was here that she began to experiment with photography.. In 1983 she moved to Edinburgh and began to find work as a self-employed photographer. She worked with community groups, charities and arts organisations, and taught evening classes. She arranged an exhibition of her early photographs entitled Lewis Women. She was awarded a Kodak Bursary and funding from Polaroid to develop and carry out an innovative educational photography project with children with special needs at Pinewood School ‚Äì We can take Pictures. In September 1983 she spent several weeks in Zimbabwe where, for the first time, she introduced an international perspective to her creative practice and photographed a local women's health project, an image from this project was later used in the Women's Press Diary. In June 1984, together with her daughter Anna and her partner, Sandy, Raffles set off to make the journey across the Soviet Union on the trans-Siberian railway to China. The two women spent over twelve months travelling and also visited Tibet, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Throughout this period she was taking many photographs, recording women's lives and work. On her return to Scotland she began to select work from her travels for future exhibition. Back in Edinburgh in the summer of 1985 Raffles returned to working as a self-employed photographer. She continued building a portfolio of educational, community-based, charity and campaign project work. In November 1985 she travelled to Mexico on a commission for The Mercury Gallery. In 1986 she carried out a project commissioned by Edinburgh District Council featuring the women athletes in the 13th Commonwealth Games held in Edinburgh. This resulted in an exhibition entitled Simply Women which toured community venues across the city. From then on she was attached to projects developed through Edinburgh District Council's Women's Committee and documented all aspects of the work of the Committee. In 1987/88 this included the booklet and touring exhibition To Let you Understand about women's lives and work across the city. In 1989 Raffles' work was included in The Stills Gallery Touring Exhibition Picturing Women. She also continued to plan international projects and spent time in Dominica and in the Soviet Union. In 1990 an exhibition of photographs taken in Russia, Georgia and the Ukraine, Women Workers, was shown in Glasgow and Rostov-on-Don, Russia. From 1991 Raffles worked, with Evelyn Gillan and a small team of other women, to establish the charity Zero Tolerance, to raise awareness of male violence against women. She was responsible for creating the images used in the early campaigns which were launched to great acclaim in Edinburgh and were then taken up by local authorities across the UK and abroad. At this time she was awarded funding as a Wingate Trust Scholar to undertake a documentary project, entitled Lot‚Äôs Wife, working with immigrant Jewish women, from the former Soviet Union, who had been resettled in Israel. She visited Israel a number of times to carry out this project which investigated ideas of family, identity, and religion. In the autumn of 1994 she was completing the selection of images and editing interviews she had carried out with the Russian Jewish women.  Death and Legacy  Raffles died on 6 December 1994 as a result of complications after giving birth to twin daughters. A retrospective exhibition of her work, Observing Women at Work, was held at the Glasgow School of Art from 4 March to 27 April 2017. The Franki Raffles Archive - including photographic prints, catalogues, negatives, contact sheets, notebooks and other materials - is held at the University of St Andrews Library.

The film stars Henry Cavill, Ben Kingsley, Alexandra Daddario, and Stanley Tucci, with Brendan Fletcher, Minka Kelly, and Nathan Fillion in supporting roles. It premiered at the LA Film Festival on September 28, 2018, originally titled as Nomis. It was later released on August 8, 2019 by DirecTV on video on demand and theatrically on September 6, 2019 by Saban Films. Plot When the body of a young woman is found on a lumber truck, Detective Walter Marshall suspects that the victim leapt to her death to escape from a captor. A breakthrough is inadvertently made in the case when former judge Michael Cooper's vigilante sting to capture a child predator results in his ward Lara being kidnapped. Through a tracker in Lara's earrings, Marshall finds her and other captive young women in a mansion owned by Simon Stulls, a seemingly-mentally disabled man. Simon is arrested and the police attempt to determine if he is responsible for the abductions. In investigating Simon's background, they discover that he was born from rape and his mother attempted suicide before giving birth to him. While Simon is in custody, the police force finds themselves being targeted by another attacker. Technician Matthew Quinn is killed in a car bombing and fellow technician Glasow is forced to free Simon when the life of his infant daughter is threatened. The police recapture Simon after he has killed his father, just as Cooper discovers that Lara is missing. Believing Simon to be responsible, Cooper ambushes his police transport when he is surprised by another man who looks exactly like Simon. It is then revealed that Simon is in fact a pair of identical twins, with one being behind the kidnappings and the other truly being mentally disabled. The twins kill Cooper and kidnap police profiler Rachel Chase before escaping. Using a tracker that Simon left in the police station, a team led by Marshall locates the twins by an icy lake where they are holding Rachel and Lara. Lara escapes and Marshall takes the mentally disabled brother hostage to convince the malevolent brother to release Rachel. After Rachel is freed, Marshall tells the mentally disabled twin to hug his brother. The mentally disabled twin complies, causing both brothers to fall through the ice and drown. Afterwards, Lara reads a letter from Cooper thanking her for all that she has done. Marshall visits his daughter Faye accompanied by Rachel, implying that Marshall and Rachel have entered into a relationship.

On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Moore of Movie Nation described the film as \\"cracked and incoherent\\" and criticized it for \\"[having] a lot of clutter, convoluted craziness and head-slappingly illogical turns in here, too\\", concluding that \\"whatever coherence the players saw on the screenplay page was lost in the trip from page to the shoot on set, and from the set to the editing bay\\". He gave the film 1.5/4 stars. Justin Lowe, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film's plot as \\"overly complicated\\", further stating that \\"Narrative and stylistic references to Se7en, Split, The Silence of the Lambs and other serial-killer thrillers only manage to demonstrate how inadequately Nomis rates by comparison.\\" References External links  2018 psychological thriller films Canadian films Canadian psychological thriller films Films shot in Winnipeg ","title":"Night Hunter (2018 film)"},{"id":"53421692","text":"Sa≈°a Uro≈°eviƒá (born 26 January 1999) is a Croatian football player who plays for NK Rudar Labin.
