South Carolina, 218 U.S. 161 (1910), was the trial of Pink Franklin for the murder of South Carolina Constable Henry H. Valentine in 1907. Franklin was a sharecropper who wished to leave his employer although his employer had advanced Franklin wages under a contract based on the so- called \\"peonage laws\\". A warrant was obtained and when Valentine came to the house, a shootout occurred, killing Valentine and injuring Franklin, his wife Patsy, and another constable who was there. The defense included claims that Franklin acted in self-defense and that the peonage laws were unjust. In appeal, the defense claimed that the make-up of the jury, all white based on the requirement that the jury be based on those who were eligible to vote, was based on unconstitutional racism in election laws stemming from the 1895 South Carolina constitution. Franklin's conviction was upheld in all appeals, including the appeal before the United States Supreme Court heard in April 1910. The case was the second time black South Carolina lawyers had appeared before the Supreme Court,Burke, William Lewis. Matthew J. Perry: The Man, His Times, and His Legacy. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2004, p23 and became famous for the issues involved. After the conviction was upheld, many figures associated both with Booker T. Washington and with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) pressured and petitioned successive governors of South Carolina for clemency. Franklin's death penalty was commuted in 1910, and in 1919 his prison sentence was commuted and he was paroled. The case was one of the first times the nascent NAACP became involved in legal proceedings. It also was an example of the power of Washington's political influence. Events of the case In 1907, African-American Pink Franklin was working as a contract farm laborer on the farm of Jake Thomas.Hine, William C. Pink Franklin: NAACP‚Äôs first legal case, The Times and Democrat, Orangeburg, SC, May 18, 2014 Thomas had given Franklin some of his wages in advance, but Franklin was unhappy with his contract and left the farm. Thomas asked the local police to intervene, and on July 29, 1907, at 3:00 AM, Constable Henry H. Valentine and Constable Carter came to Franklin's house.Annual Report of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Issue 10 Front Cover National Association for the Advancement of Colored People N.A.A.C.P., 1920 A neighbor of Franklin's, Charles Spires, sometimes worked with Thomas and was on hand.Franklin v South Carolina 218 US 161 1910 accessed on https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/218/161 Upon the Constables' instruction, Spires asked Franklin to plow his field, possibly through a closed front door. Franklin said that he would not, and that he might later in the day.Kim, Rose M. Violence and Trauma as Constitutive Elements in Racial Identity Formation, PhD in Sociology dissertation, CUNY, 2007 Valentine broke into the house and was shot and killed by Franklin. Franklin, his wife, Patsy, and Constable Carter were also shot in the melee, all surviving.Kluger, Richard. Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Aug 24, 2011, p 101 Franklin's young son was also home. The Franklins fled, afraid for their lives that they might be lynched. They took refuge with ex-state Senator Stanwix Mayfield, and with his help turned themselves in to Orangeburg Sheriff John H. Dukes. Franklin's initial trial took place on September 9, 1907. P. T. Hildebrand and three other lawyers were the prosecution and Patsy was found not guilty, while Pink was found guilty in the one-day trial heard by judge J. C. Klugh. Franklin's defense was Jacob Moorer from Orangeburg and John Adams from Columbia. The type of agricultural contract Franklin worked under was then and later called, \\"peonage laws\\". Franklin claimed that the constables broke into his house and did not identify themselves, and that he was acting in self-defense. The prosecution claimed that the doors were open and that the constables did announce their presence and identify themselves. Franklin's leaving the Thomas farm was legal, otherwise his contract would have, indeed, been illegal peonage, but the landowner had convinced officials to write a warrant for his arrest. Franklin was sentenced to hang after the initial trial, a sentence that was confirmed in a resentencing in early September 1910, with a date set in December to give chance for further appeal - Moorer and Adams stated they would appeal.Pink Franklin to Hang He is Resentenced by Judge Sease and Date Fixed for December. State (Columbia, South Carolina). Wednesday, September 7, 1910, Page: 1 The jury was all white and Moorer and Adams felt this was due to unconstitutional discrimination against blacks seeking to register to vote (and thus to be eligible for juries). It was reported that even trial judge Klugh believed that Franklin would not have been convicted if he were white. Appeal to the Supreme Court The appeal was unsuccessful in South Carolina, and the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Ex Attorney General Charles Bonaparte became interested in the case and wrote a brief to the court. Bonaparte had broad popular support for joining the case, but Adams and Moorer were determined to show that black lawyers could argue the case.Smith, Jr, J. Clay. Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944. University of Pennsylvania Press, Jan 1, 1999 p 261 Adams said that Bonaparte's submission of a brief in Franklin's appeal to the Supreme Court is, \\"The work of a few hot-headed negroes of Philadelphia, who have absolutely no authority to take such a step in the case\\".Adams on Franklin Case. Charleston News and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina). Thursday, April 7, 1910, Page: 1 Adams and Moorer may have been willing to include Bonaparte as an equal and refused his aide when Bonaparte wanted to take charge of the case.Why Bonaparte Planned Butt-in Sought to Make Party Capital of Franklin Matter. Argument in Case. State (Columbia, South Carolina). Thursday, April 21, 1910 Issue: 6768 Page: 1 Without Bonaparte in the chambers, Moorer and Adams argued their case April 20 and 21, 1910. The appeal was based in part on rules in South Carolina at that time that only people who could vote could serve on a jury. The lawyers argued that racist qualifications for voters in the Constitution of 1895 resulted in a jury of unjust make-up. However, the court found that black men of good moral character were equally eligible to serve on the jury and that there was no denial of rights on this account, issuing their decision on May 31, 1910 with the opinion of the court written by Justice Day and no concurring or dissenting opinion offered. Sentence commuted After the trial, Moorer and Adams were joined by many others in seeking other means to save Franklin. Moorer and Adams petitioned June 25, 1910 to commute Franklin's sentence from death to life in prison.Franklin Lawyers Trying to Save Him Will Ask Jurors Who Convicted Negro to Sign Petition. State (Columbia, South Carolina). Sunday, June 26, 1910. Issue: 6833 Section: Part I Page: 1 Boneparte felt that Adams and Moorer were wrong to remove him from the case. Journalist and early supporter of the NAACP, Oswald Garrison Villard wrote to Booker T. Washington, agreeing with Bonaparte and a similar view stated by Albert E. Pillsbury that Franklin was not well defended due to the \\"stupidity and conceit\\" of his counsel and asked Washington for his help.Washington, Booker T. Harland, Louis R. The Booker T. Washington Papers, Volume 10. University of Illinois Press, 1981, p362-365 WashingtonTischauser, Leslie Vincent. Jim Crow Laws. ABC-CLIO, 2012, p 54 and another NAACP activist, Joel Elias Spingarn, became involved. Washington contacted Taft, black legislator Thomas E. Miller, NAACP secretary Francis Blascoer,Sullivan, Patricia. Lift Every Voice: The NAACP and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement. The New Press, Jul 29, 2009 and others became involved and two white attorneys, Bernard Hagood and Claude Sawyer were hired to convince then South Carolina governor Martin Frederick Ansel to commute the decision. Franklin's death sentence was commuted to life on December 30, 1910 coming into effect January 6, 1911,DuBois, William Edward Burghardt. The Crisis, Volumes 17 Crisis Publishing Company, 1917, p231 but Ansel's predecessor, Cole Blease, was not considered receptive to calls to repudiate injustice towards blacks. Eventually Franklin's sentence was commuted to 99 years on a chain gang and finally he was paroled after nine years. He was released in January 1919 on parole \\"during good behavior\\", his sentence commuted by then South Carolina Governor Richard I. Manning. Aftermath After his release, Franklin changed his name to Mack Rockingham and lived in Blackville, South Carolina with Patsy and two sons. He died in 1949. Pointing to the key role that Washington and his contacts played in the case, some point to the affair as a failure by W. E. B. DuBois and the NAACP. The inability of NAACP leaders to help Franklin has been compared with the case of Steve Greene in 1910 (shortly after the Franklin case). Greene fled with a bullet wound in his shoulder to Chicago after killing an Arkansas farmer who tried to indenture or enslave Franklin on his farm. Greene was extradited to Arkansas, and was threatened with lynching. Ida B. Wells-Barnett's Negro Fellowship League raised money to organize a defense committee and safely bring Greene to Canada. Further, Washington was skeptical of legal solutions for Franklin in favor of political ones, a view that was ultimately validated.James, Joy. Transcending the Talented Tenth: Black Leaders and American Intellectuals. Routledge, Jan 21, 2014, p 51. On the other hand, the NAACP saw Franklin's ultimate release as a success of their organization, and continues to claim that the case was their first case. Peonage laws returned to the Supreme Court in 1911 when Alabama's peonage laws were overturned in Bailey v. Alabama. References See also *Burke, Lewis W. Pink Franklin v.

Roberts (1885‚Äì1952) was a graduate of Kansas State Agricultural College and veteran of World War I who was the first black man to attain the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps. He began his auto business by placing ads in the local paper advertising used cars. By the end of 1919, Roberts had negotiated over 60 car sales exclusively for African- American buyers. He hired two salesmen to work his lot, offered auto insurance and payment terms to customers, and later founded Roberts Motors, the first African-American owned car dealership in the United States.  Career Late (1923) Marmon 34B 2-passenger Speedster Roberts understood the power of advertising, targeting ads in The Kansas City Sun, the prominent local African-American newspaper. His 'cutting edge' advertisements were quickly responded to by the black community and his business prospered. By 1921, he had acquired offices and showrooms, hired two salesmen and increased sales to meet the growing business. = Dealerships = With his success at capturing the negro market, many small, niche auto manufacturers entered into sales agreements with Roberts. Smaller companies like Hupmobile, Rickenbacker, Whippet, and Marmon saw potential in the negro market and also backed his business, landing him franchises by Hupmobile in 1923 and by Rickenbacker in 1925. He had also signed a local Oldsmobile dealer to a distributorship arrangement in 1923 that bore fruit under the Oldsmobile banner. This also helped Roberts to land a Ford franchise that grew to feature an auto repair shop, a parts store, along a 60-car showroom. By 1925, his dealership, Roberts Co. Motor Mart, was ranked third in the United States for its sales of the Rickenbacker automobile. A new facility, when completed would offer painting, tires, repairs, accessories, upholstering, batteries, and a filling station. = Roberts Co. Motor Mart. = July 29, 1923 the formal opening of the new building named Roberts Company Motor Mart. was attended by over 3000 people and later that year the Roberts Company was selling brand new Oldsmobiles, an auto made in Detroit by General Motors. 1924 saw the Roberts company as an Oldsmobile dealer which sold hundreds Of Oldsmobile 6's. It included a 1,750-square-foot showroom, offices and service areas along with space to store and display 60 vehicles. At its peak, the business employed 55 blacks in the various endeavors. Later he opened a second dealership in Chicago. He advertised daily in The Kansas City Call, the largest African-American newspaper in Kansas City. During this period he was a broker for 15 white dealers in the Kansas City area who preferred not to have blacks mingling with their other customers in their showrooms.https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=93SDBwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&output;=reader&source;=gbs_atb_hover&pg;=GBS.PA77 Edward Davis ref He then partnered with 2 black businessmen in Kansas City and a Hupmobile dealership under Thomas 'Big Piney' Brown remained at this location until 1929. In 1928, Roberts and the other businessman, Kenneth Campbell Jr., moved to Chicago and in 1929 opened a second Hupmobile dealership, located at the Hotel Grand on South Parkway. It was the second black-owned automobile dealership in America. Both the Kansas City and Chicago dealerships were named Roberts-Campbell Motors Inc. 'Big Piney' Brown managed the Kansas City dealership until it closed in 1929. Due to the depression and the failure of the Chicago showrooms, Roberts subsequently let the Kansas City showroom falter, eventually closing the operation. By then, Hupmobile had appointed Harry Williams, a black, as a replacement in 1930, but little else about the dealership is available, it was closed shortly thereafter. Today, the Roberts Motor Mart still has a dealership operating in Kansas City. After the closing of his dealerships, Roberts worked as a salesman for local white dealers who wanted to appeal to black customers.

Susanna Hansson Collection. Bohus Stickning was a Swedish knitting cooperative that was active between 1939 and 1969. It was established as a cottage industry to provide income for poor families in Bohusl√§n (Sweden) during the Great Depression. Knitwear designed by the founder Emma Jacobsson and other designers was handknit by women in Bohusl√§n Province and sold to department stores, boutiques and fashion houses both in Sweden and internationally. Background and establishment Emma Jacobsson, wife of the governor of Bohusl√§n, was approached in 1937 by a group of women who wanted to help launch a cooperative to increase economic opportunities for low-income families during a time of high unemployment. They experimented with the manufacture and sale of various products; the goal was to find a craft that did not require special equipment and that most women in the province could perform without special training. They decided upon the manufacture of handknit garments. Bohus Stickning was officially founded 12 September 1939 by Emma Jacobsson, who was its leader and guiding force throughout its thirty-year history. During its earliest months, the cooperative produced mittens and socks. Emma Jacobsson was able to sell a number of these to large stores in Stockholm, such as Nordiska Kompaniet. From 1940 onward, Bohus Stickning produced scarves, hats, sweaters, and jackets, specializing in women's wear. Design Since there was no local knitting tradition in Bohusl√§n, Bohus Stickning recruited artists to produce new designs for the cooperative. During the 1940s, a characteristic \\"Bohus Stickning\\" style emerged: multicolored patterns making use of lightweight, wool or angora blend yarn, formed from distinctive combinations of knit and purl stitches. Aside from Emma Jacobsson (a trained art historian and artist herself), Bohus Stickning designers included Vera Bjurstr√∂m (1939-early 1940s), Anna-Lisa Mannheimer Lunn (1940s-1953), Annika Malmstr√∂m-Bladini (1952-1959, then as a freelance designer until the mid-1960s), Kerstin Olson (1958-1969), and Karin Ivarsson (1960-1969). Mona Reuterberg, Margareta Nordlund, Ulla Eson Bodin, and Erna Gislev also took an active part in the artistic work of the cooperative. G√∂ta Tr√§g√•rdh also acted as a fashion advisor to help boost the cooperative's artistic profile. The Bohus Stickning brand became synonymous with high style and Swedish fashion. Notable clients included Helena Rubinstein, Juliette Gr√©co, Ingrid Bergman, Eartha Kitt, Grace Kelly, and Barbro Alving.  The Revival  In 1995, Wendy Keele published Poems of Color: Knitting in the Bohus Tradition and the Women Who Drove This Swedish Cottage Industry. Her book kindled a revival of interest in Bohus Stickning, particularly outside of Sweden, offering the first extended history of the cooperative in English, including color reproductions of original design cards, and republishing photographs of vintage Bohus Stickning garments. In 1999, working with the Bohusl√§ns Museum, master dyer Solveig Gustafsson sourced and dyed yarns to recreate Bohus Stickning garments from original pattern cards and instructions. She later recreated 70 Bohus Stickning patterns and offered the patterns and dyed yarns for sale through her business, Solsilke, and via the Bohusl√§ns Museum, before retiring in 2014. Angora rabbit farmer Pernille Silfverberg then took over the enterprise and expanded the pattern repertoire through her business, Angoragarnet. The story of their research and efforts is chronicled in the museum's book, authored by Viveka Overland, Bohus Stickning: P√• Nytt, The Revival (2015). Gustafsson and the Bohusl√§ns Museum are joint owners of the Bohus Stickning trademark. Bohus Stickning recreations are popular among knitters interested in fine gauge, multi-color, stranded knitting.In particular, those active in the Bohus Stickning discussion group on Ravelry. Notably, Stephanie Pearl McPhee has blogged about her knitting progress during work on two Bohus Stickning reproduction sweaters, and Kate Davies has analyzed the Bohus Stickning yoke style through knitting the Gotiska F√∂nstret, or Gothic Window sweater. In 2009, Susanna Hansson and Wendy J. Johnson curated the exhibition, \\"Bohus Stickning. Radiant Knits: An Enchanting Obsession,\\" at the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which highlighted both the history and legacy of the Bohus Stickning cooperative.

The S7, S7 Edge & S7 Active feature a 1440p Quad HD Super AMOLED display; the S7 & S7 Active both have a 5.1-inch panel, while the S7 Edge uses a larger 5.5-inch panel. As with the prior model, the S7 Edge's screen is curved along the side bezels of the device. The charging port of the Galaxy S7 is equipped with a moisture sensor. While it detects moisture inside the USB port, wired charging is deactivated to prevent damage to the equipment.  Batteries  All three models (S7, S7 Edge & S7 Active) have larger batteries in comparison to the S6, with 3000 mAh, 3600 mAh & 4000 mAh capacity respectively and support for AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA) and Qi wireless charging standards; however, the S7 does use MicroUSB charging. For wired charging, Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 with up to 15 Watts is supported. Wireless charging is supported with 7.5 Watts of effective power through a Qi 1.2 supported wireless charging plate connected to a Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 USB charger. Samsung claims the Galaxy S7 to be able to fully charge using wired and wireless fast charging within 90 and 140 minutes respectively, while 100 and 160 minutes respectively on the S7 edge. Fast charging is disabled while the device is in operation. (reference covers Galaxy S7 and S6.  Camera  The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge feature a 12-megapixel (4032√ó3024) rear- facing camera with \\"Dual Pixel\\" image sensor technology for faster autofocus and an f/1.7 aperture lens. Slow motion videos are recorded with 720p HD at 240 fps, which is twice the frame rate used on the Galaxy S6 and Note 5. For the first time on a Samsung flagship device, slow motion video recording at 240fps is possible. The 240 fps footage is encoded in real-time and recorded with audio. The footage can be edited with the precluded slow motion video editing software.GSMArena Samsung Galaxy S7 camera review The five-minute time limit for 2160p video has been removed.

In the United States the S7 uses the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820; unlike Exynos, this SoC supports older CDMA networks that are extensively used by carriers in these markets. The heat from the processor is transferred with a 0.4mm thick water-to-steam heat pipe cooling system but still it gets hot to touch. The S7 includes either 32, 64 or 128 GB of internal storage (in most markets only the 32 GB model will be available). Storage can be expanded using a microSD card. S7 devices are packaged with a USB OTG adapter. It can be used with the included \\"Smart Switch\\" app to help transfer content and settings from a previous Samsung Galaxy device running Android 4.3 or later, iPhone running iOS 5 or later, or BlackBerry running BlackBerry OS 7 or earlier. =Software= The edge notifications feature. The Galaxy S7 ships with Android Marshmallow (6.0) and Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz software suite. The new TouchWiz also allows the user to disable the app drawer. A new \\"always on\\" functionality displays a clock, calendar, and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. The display is turned off if the device's proximity sensor detects that it is in an enclosed space such as a pocket. Samsung claims this feature would only consume half a percentage of battery capacity per-hour. New widget panes can be displayed on the edge of the S7 Edge, in \\"Edge Single\\" and wider \\"Edge Single Plus\\" sizes. Android Marshmallow's \\"adopted storage\\" feature is disabled and not usable. A software update in September 2016 added support for Vulkan, a new low-level graphics API. In January 2017, Samsung released an update to Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\", which replaced TouchWiz with the Samsung Experience software suite (introduced in the Galaxy S8). In mid 2018, the S7 and S7 edge received Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\". The user interface of the multi windowing feature which allows showing multiple supported applications simultaneously on the screen, both as flexible split screen, as well as floating pop-up, is similar to the preceding Galaxy S6.Guide on the Galaxy S7 multi window feature by AndroidCentral Reception The Galaxy S7 received generally positive reviews with critics praising the return of the micro SD card slot and water resistance, while retaining the premium metal design of the preceding Galaxy S6. The design of the larger Galaxy S7 Edge was particularly praised, as its curved sides on the S7 Edge are used to \\"make the phone much narrower than it would be if it had a flat display. It makes the whole device smaller and easier to use. That becomes readily apparent when you put the S7 Edge next to other devices with 5.5-inch or similar screens\\" like the iPhone 6s Plus (5.5-inch) and Google Nexus 6P (5.7-inch). The quality of the primary (rear-facing) camera has been further improved, despite the megapixel decrease from 16 MP to 12 MP, it has larger 1.4-micron pixels and even faster focusing than its S6 predecessor. There was some criticism of the Galaxy S7, due to the removal of MHL support and the IR Blaster of the Galaxy S6, stock music and video player apps have been replaced by the Google Play equivalents, and the use of an \\"obsolete\\" Micro USB charging port instead of USB Type C. The Exynos version is faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon version at multitasking. There is a clear difference, as the Qualcomm version fails to keep as many apps in the background and takes more time to switch between apps.Spesifikasi dan Harga Samsung Galaxy S7 2016 - Hpponsel.com news However, the Snapdragon version performs better in graphically intensive apps and games. iFixit gave the S7 a repairability score of 3 out of 10, noting an excessive use of glue and glass panels, as well as it being nearly impossible to service certain components of the device (such as the daughterboard and other components) without removing the screen, which is not designed to be removed, and that \\"replacing the glass without destroying the display is probably impossible\\". =Sales= Between the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, approximately 100,000 devices were sold within two days of the official launch in South Korea. The Galaxy S7 had between 7-9 million units shipped in its first month. A total of 48 million units were sold in 2016. Galaxy S7 edge was the most popular handset from South Korean's 2016 lineup. The Galaxy J3, which is regarded as an entry-level device, found its place in the 6th most popular phone for 2016. The iPhone 6s had around 60 million shipments, whereas the Galaxy S7 edge and other phones from Samsung garnered around 25 million shipments. Known issues At release, videos recorded at high frame rates stuttered, with both Exynos and Snapdragon models suffering from the issue. A following firmware update claimed to fix \\"flickering video playback after recording\\". Some S7 Edge units have an irremovable vertical pink line on the display, which seems to appear at random. Samsung is offering free repairs/replacements for users in Belgium/Netherlands/Luxembourg (limited to those) under warranty given that the screen is not externally damaged. It is extremely difficult to repair a broken screen. Removal of the AMOLED panel will be required should the user break the screen on a Galaxy S7.

Aboriginal whaling is valued for its contribution to food stocks (subsistence economy) and to cultural survival, although the days of commercial whaling in the United States and in Canada are over. I√±upiat The bowhead whale is of great cultural significance to the I√±upiat in Utqiagvik, Alaska, who say that one cannot live without the other. According to the I√±upiat, the whale is the center of their diet, culture, and spirit. This makes them dependent on the complex system of sharing and celebrating the whale,Hess, Bill. 1999.

For the I√±upiat, subsistence hunting and fishing are important and viable economic strategies, which provide food and raw materials for the whole group. When hunters bring whales back to the community, about 65‚Äì70 people drag the whale onto the ice, where they work all day to harvest the meat. They work non-stop to prevent the whale's body heat from melting the ice too much. Afterwards, the captain and crew of the hunt invite the community to a celebratory meal.ECHO Partners. \\"I√±upiaq Whale Hunt.\\" YouTube. February 25, 2009. Accessed March 22, 2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqEK7K5oCQ Once the captain has taken what he needs, he gives the rest of the whale away to his community and any others who need the food. However, despite its necessity, the interest in subsistence hunting has reduced among the youth in the tribes. Reasons for this decline include a lack of training, a lack of equipment, changing dietary preferences, a lack of interest, an increasing dependence upon wage employment, and interest in other activities (for example, basketball, hockey, and baseball). Eskimos standing beside umiak on sled, Point Barrow, Alaska Subsistence hunters take pride in what they do, because they see themselves as strong providers for their family and community. People within the Inuit community describe active hunters as follows \\"1) active hunters are always sharing meat with other people, 2) active hunters are always ready to go out hunting at a moment's notice, 3) active hunters travel at any time of year and not just during the spring, and 4) active hunters know more about travelling in cold weather and on the sea ice.\\" On the way to the hunt, they travel by snowmobile across the ice until they find a safe campsite, which can sometimes take all day. The campsite must be near landlocked ice, so the hunters can move to the safety of solid ice in an emergency. Once on the hunt, they kill with harpoons and dart guns while sitting in their umiak (made from seal hide and part of a caribou). Most nutrition is derived from the whale's meat and organs. According to the I√±upiat people, the whale's maktak, the thick black skin and attached oily blubber, contains body-warming energy and vitamin C. The whale's bones are used to frame sod iglus (igloo), and the elastic baleen is woven into baskets. The liver membrane is used for drums. Legal rights to tribes in Alaska The problem of food security creates a need for laws on hunting in Alaska. Under the United Nations‚Äô Food and Agriculture Association (FAO), food security is defined as the ability for an individual to \\"have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\\"Theriault, Sophie, Ghislain Otis, Gerard Duhaime, and Christopher Furgal. \\"The legal protection of subsistence: a prerequisite of food security for the Inuit of Alaska.\\" Alaska Law Review 22 (2005): 35. ANCSA Regional Corporations Map Under this definition, Alaskans would be able to hunt the bowhead whale despite conservation efforts, which creates a need for official regulation. Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971, which removed \\"all aboriginal titles, if any, and claims of aboriginal title in Alaska based on use and occupancy, including submerged land underneath all water areas, both inland and offshore, and including any aboriginal hunting or fishing rights that may exist\\".Declaration of Settlement US. Code ¬ß 1603. of 1971, title 43. The act also titled Natives with \\"44 million acres of Alaska and extinguished remaining claims with a $1 billion payment.\\"Richardson, J.R. 1992. \\"Hunting for a balance.\\" National Parks 66, no. 3/4: 34. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed March 1, 2016). Natives received compensation under this act, but it did not protect subsistence hunting. This led natives to look for exceptions in other laws, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). In 1980, The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was adapted to include subsidence hunting and fishing rights. This act gives up its rights to lands and fishing rights and gives them to native Americans, Eskimos, or Aleuts for subsistence use. \\"ANILCA provides that Alaska may obtain subsistence jurisdiction of federal lands upon passage of a law providing for a similar subsistence priority for rural residents\\".Local and Regional Participation US. Code ¬ß 3115. of 1595, 1980, 1997, 1998, title 16. The ANILCA also granted permanent protection to 104 million acres of federal land, including more than 40 million acres of parkland. Under ANILCA, Natives are allowed to substance hunt on seven new and expanded parks. ANILCA governs subsistence for \\"rural residents\\", on federal lands, whereas state law governs subsistence for \\"all Alaskans\\", on state and private lands (including Native-owned ANCSA lands). Since both state and federal governments take care of Alaska's subsistence hunting laws, dual management between state and federal agencies is needed. This is currently guided by an Interim Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). =Natives and hunting licences= Permits are required to practise subsistence hunting in state of Alaska. The above laws allow for any resident of Alaska to apply for these permits. Because of this, many of the laws made for subsistence hunting fall in line with Alaska's normal hunting laws. A person under the age of sixteen must have completed a Basic Hunter Education course or be with someone over the age of sixteen who has. One can also be with an adult born no later than January 1, 1986.\\"Subsistence and Personal Use Fishing Licenses and Permits, Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\\" Subsistence and Personal Use Fishing Licenses and Permits, Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Alaska Department of Fish and Game, n.d. Web. 21 Mar. 2016. Permit applications must be submitted between November 1st and December 15th or they will be is discarded. Game for use as food in customary and traditional Alaska Native religious ceremonies may be hunted out of season and more than the allowed limits. Permits are awarded to those who score highest on the application questions. Each application is scored on five questions, and permits for each hunt are given starting at the highest overall score and working downward until all permits have been given. Hunters may also apply for multiple permits (as separate applications), but can hold only one permit for each species of animal they wish to hunt. Permits cannot be transferred to another person, unless they are \\"active duty military personnel deployed to a combat zone who are unable to use their Tier II permit [who] may transfer their permit to a substitute hunter who is a resident of Alaska.\\" While hunting, one must carry the required permits, valid hunting licenses and, if appropriate, big game locking tags. At the end of the season all permits must be returned, regardless of use. In Arctic Canada The Inuit have hunted whales long before European whaling ships showed up in the 1700s. from the 1940s they were forced to stop, but resumed in the 1990s. Only a few licenses are available each year. The hunt is monitored and co-managed by Nunavik Marine Regional Wildlife Board, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

The house was designed by the New York architect Wallace K. Harrison for Julian Street Jr. and his wife, Narcissa, in 1938. Harrison, primarily known as a monuments architect through his works in New York City like Rockefeller Center and the United Nations complex,Goldberger (1981), p. 1. also designed a few private residences. Harrison designed and built the residence at 710 Long Hill Road West as an unconventional experiment in the early Modernist architecture that was just being introduced in America during the late 1930s. Background During the 1930s, Wallace K. Harrison had a personal relationship with Street. As a new partner in the architectural firm Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, Harrison was invited to join other architects to design Rockefeller Center.Goldberger (1981), p. 3. Harrison was good friends with Street, who worked at National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and whom Harrison knew through his own wife, Ellen.Newhouse (1989), p. 39. During the planning of Rockefeller Center, the Metropolitan Opera dropped out as the main tenant; Harrison then needed a new tenant, so he had lunch with his friend, where Harrison told Street that he thought it would be best \\"if it were NBC at Rockefeller Center broadcasting to the world\\". By this time, both NBC and RKO Pictures were under the control of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). After negotiations, RCA became the largest tenant for the central skyscraper of Rockefeller Center and RKO occupied the second building. Street and his wife Narcissa Vanderlip were from wealthy families. She was the daughter of Frank and Narcissa Cox Vanderlip, who lived at Beechwood in Briarcliff Manor; Vanderlip was the president of the National City Bank from 1909 to 1919. Narcissa Vanderlip attended the Scarborough School, graduated from Vassar College in 1925, and was a member of the Junior League; while her husband, Julian Street Jr., graduated from Princeton University in 1925 where he was the editorial chairman for The Daily Princetonian‚Äîby 1925, he was on the staff of The New York Herald Tribune. Julian Street Jr. was the son of notable author Julian Street, who wrote such works as Abroad at Home (1914), Mysterious Japan (1921), Rita Coventry (1922), and Where Paris Dines (1929). Street Jr. was working as a scriptwriter for NBC, where he adapted Booth Tarkington's Penrod for broadcasting, the first popular book to be formatted for broadcast purposes.\\"Julian Street Jr. '25.\\" Princeton Alumni Weekly, September 13, 2014, page 1, article retrieved May 22, 2014. Both Narcissa and Julian Street Jr. were the children of wealthy Gilded Age American families, and it was not surprising that they later married. Their parents were connected, as Frank Vanderlip, Narcissa's father, knew Julian Street Jr.'s father since the Bank Panic of 1907, when Frank helped Street keep his money safe with National City Bank.Mack (2013), pp. 104-5. The Streets were married in April 1927 in a lavish ceremony at the New Church, a Georgian building on 35th Street in New York City; at their reception, held at the Colony Club, more than 1,500 guests attended, including Goulds, Vanderbilts and Roosevelts.Cheever (1990), p. 98. After their marriage, Edward Walker Harden, a Briarcliff Manor estate owner and longtime friend of Frank Vanderlip, gave land on the east side of Sleepy Hollow Road in Briarcliff Manor to the Streets.Cheever (1990), pp. 108-9. The Streets, however, preferred the land that was already owned by the Vanderlips on Long Hill Road West, which was more private and secluded, so they sold the land given by Harden.Cheever (1990), p. 109. According to a map from October 6, 1937, Street's mother-in-law owned the land on which the Streets' new house, designed by Wallace K. Harrison, was built.(Sells 1937). Design and construction The Street family considered Harrison a skyscraper architect, so his decision to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them.Newhouse (1989), p. 66. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone in the shape of an L, with a short stone wall extending from the back of the house, and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along the front of the house to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed.(Sells 1938). The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass porthole windows, and large panes of glass and doors on the back of the house‚Äîit was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style,Breuer (2005), p. 2:505. and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926.Gropius (2005), p. 5:510. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, one that did not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration. Breuer and Gropius were teaching their new modern industrial architecture design in the United States around the time when the Street residence was designed and built in the late 1930s. The Bauhaus was closed by the German government in 1933, and by 1934, Walter Gropius had fled Germany since he was unsympathetic to the Nazi regime; he immigrated with his ideas to Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 1937, to teach architecture as a professor of architecture at Harvard University. There he introduced the Bauhaus philosophy of modern design to the architecture curriculum at Harvard, and his advocacy for this design philosophy was quickly popular among his students; this soon resulted in the educational changes in other architecture schools in the United States, starting the decline of \\"historically imitative architecture\\" in America.Gropius (2005), pp. 5:5101. By 1937, Breuer had also moved from Germany to teach at Harvard, where he practiced with Walter Gropius from 1938 to 1941. In addition, Harrison was also in communication with Walter Gropius and would have known about his ideas concerning early Modernist architecture, as his wife Ellen organized a lunch in 1931 attended by Gropius and other architects, and Harrison remembered meeting Gropius there.Newhouse (1989), p. 48. Architecture Detail of stonework and windows Julian Street Jr. welcomed Harrison's experimentation and favored his innovative plan. When he was interviewed forty-five years later, Street still insisted that: Circa 1940 images of the house show that Modernist elements were incorporated into Harrison's design. A photograph of the fa√ßade reveals a stone garage next to a simple white door, with a high serpentine wall snaking up the ramp path to the front door; the house's two-story fa√ßade is made of stone with porthole windows and a large rectangular stone structure to the right of the front door.Newhouse (1989), p. 68. It presents a very private and industrial front, with stone and glass, and a ramp path to the door, like a conveyor belt in a factory. The back view exemplifies use of the building's twelve exterior doors, many of them stone and glass, and opens up to a wider view of the back, which is more spacious with trees and in harmony with nature because of the local fieldstone that echoes the surrounding rocky landscape. There is little ornamental decoration, it is simply constructed with industrial materials in keeping with Breuer and Gropius's idea of \\"unit construction\\" or the bringing together of \\"standard units to create a technologically simple but functionally complex whole,\\" and the use of new materials to create art design that reflected the age of industry. With Harrison's use of steel and glass, as well as the industrial conveyor-belt like ramp to the house's front door, Harrison used new materials to reflect the age of industry, and its simple forms of stone sections form a composite, complex stone entirety. Gropius and Breuer designed Gropius's own house in ppLincoln, Massachusetts , which used both fieldstone and wood painted white, re-establishing \\"New England traditionalism in modern terms.\\"Gropius (2005), p. 5:511. With his use of fieldstone in the Street residence, Harrison was even incorporating some of the same materials as the Modernist architects of his time, Gropius and Breuer. Inside this residence, the house originally had a very simple interior, with a large living room to the right of the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a long hallway to the left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase in the front hall, and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen).Vastola (2014) In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. The large circular windows present throughout the house gave the Street family the impression of \\"living on a boat\\". Harrison designing this house to give the impression of being on a luxury liner or yacht aesthetically reflects the industrial age. Built on undulating rocky landscaping, the house looks as if it were a ship with porthole windows, its large stone prow cutting through waves of water (the serpentine wall). The serpentine wall also had the additional function of hiding the servants' door to the kitchen, which was at the top of the ramp behind this wall. The use of stone in this house reflected the local rocky landscape and Harrison used the stone to make the house blend in with the country landscape around it. The residence remains as one of the first houses in the contemporary style built in Westchester County, and thus Harrison helped bring the aesthetic of early- Modern architecture to the county. The backyard, its gardens, and the surrounding woods on the property are in size. Subsequent owners and renovations The Julian Street Jr. residence is still extant. By 1974, the house was owned by Howard and Janette R. Tomkins and the property was subdivided to allow a separate building lot. Other changes were the removal of the stone wall and guardrail by the driveway, which was then paved with asphalt, and building a playhouse at the top of a rock pile in front of the house. The house was also changed: the stone wall behind the house was extended into a curve while the front gravel walkway was retained, the ramp behind the serpentine wall had stairs added to it, a curved wall was added in front of the front door, and a flagstone terrace was added to the back and side of the west part of the house.(Sells 1974). By the late 1970s, the house was owned by the Birnbaum family, who added steps to the front ramp up to the house, reduced the height of the serpentine wall, and added a raised entertainment area in part of the large living room. In 2001, the house was purchased by Robert Niosi, Sally Lee, and their family, and Niosi undertook a major renovation of the home: he expanded the kitchen and changed the door to the servants' quarters into a bookshelf. He also renovated the master bedroom upstairs but left the circular windows alone, expanding the front door window to let more light into the front hallway, and he copper-paneled the front Dutch-style door. In addition, the outdated boiler system was replaced, and the entrance to the living room was widened. Niosi left the exterior relatively unchanged, but he said that when he bought the house, it was very \\"austere\\" inside‚Äîthe walls were simple white or beige in color, with no ornamentation; the only decoration was on the unique Harrison-designed spiral staircase to the second floor, which had brass bamboo supports that Niosi left alone; he stated that the staircase had been built in Japan and exported in one piece. Niosi had previously lived in a Victorian apartment, decorated both inside and out, so when he moved to this Harrison-designed house, it was initially cold and unwelcoming with its simplicity and lack of decoration. To address this, Niosi added more traditional 1930s Mackintosh Arts and Crafts interior wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper in order to decorate and soften the interior of the house and make it more warm and inviting. This redecoration gave this residence a unique combination of a conventional 1930s Arts and Crafts interior design with an unconventional early Modernist exterior. He also had many walls and doors removed that were deemed unnecessary, and raised ceilings and added windows. The house's kitchen, with an adjoining maid's room and bathroom, was replaced with a modern kitchen. The living room was split to include a home theater and the wet bar was replaced to accommodate a film collection. After the remodel, parts of the house were featured in Ladies' Home Journal and Parents. Niosi has also been noted for a replica time machine, based on the prop used in The Time Machine, a 1960 film based on H. G. Wells' novella of the same name. The model, which has taken about fourteen years to construct, lies in the house's basement. See also * History of Briarcliff Manor References =Cited in footnotes=    * Sells, Charles H. (N. Y.

Bionomics Not all species have been well documented, but females of some are known to feed primarily on birds but will also bite cattle. The females bite primarily at night, and are most active during the early part of the night. They occasionally attack humans during daylight hours in shady places when their habitat is entered. Adult females lay their eggs on the surface of water in areas of emergent vegetation to which hatchling larvae attach themselves with a modified siphon, on the roots or submerged stems, and where they remain throughout development; pupae also attach themselves the plants by means of a modified respiratory trumpet, and remain there until the adult is ready to emerge. Species in the subgenus Coquillettidia are primarily Afrotropical, but some are found in the Oriental and Australasian Regions, one occurs in North America and two occur in the Palearctic region. Austromansonia occurs only in New Zealand, while species of subgenus Rhynchotaenia are confined to the Neotropical Region. Medical importance Coquillettidia perturbans is considered a vector of eastern equine encephalitis; other species are secondary or suspected vectors of Brugia malayi the cause of lymphatic filariasis, and Rift Valley fever.

She studied medicine in Basel and worked at the Inselspital in Bern, then moved to Boston to train in research at the Beth Israel Deaconess hospital, where she was a post-doctoral fellow. She worked with a multi-institution group based at Boston University that was the first to generate thyroid cell progenitors and thyroid follicular organoids from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in mice, and thyroid cell progenitors from induced PSCs in humans. This was achieved by establishing the signalling required to create a thyroid lineage, namely BMP4 and FGF2. It was shown that thyroid hormones were secreted by the mice organoids after transplantation into mice. Kurmann was planning to return to Switzerland to become head of endocrine surgery at the Inselspital, but was killed in a bicycle crash in Boston. As she was riding south on Mass Ave, a flatbed tractor trailer turned right onto Beacon Street in front of her and Anita was run over by the trailer's wheels. The group's paper of which she was co-lead author was dedicated to her memory. In the police report, Boston police state the truck driver had his right turn signal active for eight seconds prior to the turn, and that Kurmann was riding in a bus lane when she was struck. Bicycle advocates maintain she had the right to use that lane. Police investigators concluded that Kurmann failed to recognize the truck was turning and was riding in the truck's blind spot. All large trucks have 4 documented blind spots, the largest of which is on the right side of the vehicle. Though trucks in many European countries have begun to utilize or require a 6 mirror system to eliminate the driver's inability to see in these blindspots and/or advanced collision sensors with automatic braking, no such equipment is required for large trucks driving on America's urban roads. In the city of London in the UK, trucks, or lorries as they're called, were connected with more than half of all cycling deaths and a quarter of pedestrian deaths even though they only make up 4% of the city's traffic. To protect its cyclists, London is set to ban all trucks without the appropriate anti-collision and/or 6 mirror blindspot visibility systems in 2020. ‚ÄúOur groundbreaking direct vision standard will be the first of its kind in the world, directly addressing the issue of lethal driver blindspots. I‚Äôm also proud that TfL will lead by example and will not use any zero-star lorries in its supply chain from the new financial year,\\" said London's Mayor Sadiq Khan. Following this crash, the intersection of Beacon Street where it occurred was equipped with advanced stop lines.

Miles, featuring illustrations by J. L. Phillips. The book was first published in the United States on February 9, 2014 through Handsome Prince Publishing, and has been translated into 26 languages and is available in over 137 countries. The story follows two men tasked with saving a princess, only to discover their love for one another. A sequel entitled The Princes and the Dragon has been written and will focus upon Earnest and Gallant's life raising twin boys.  Plot  The strong and capable Princess Elena has a problem ‚Äì her father, King Rufus, has been pressuring her to marry a prince, despite her own desire not to marry a prince. In desperation Elena makes a wish and is whisked away by an old woman in a carriage, prompting her father to announce that he will marry Elena to any one that can rescue her. The request is answered by two men, the reluctant and shy bookworm Earnest and the strong and handsome Gallant. They eventually manage to make their way to the tower where Elena is being held, only for the old woman to demand that they bring her the \\"greatest treasure in the land\\" in exchange for the princess. Assuming that she meant physical goods, Earnest and Gallant seek out the land's five greatest treasures, only to fall in love in the process discover that the greatest treasure isn't a physical good but rather their love for one another. They return to the old woman with their answer, at which point she transforms into a beautiful enchantress and Elena is freed. The three return to the King, who is overjoyed at his daughter's return and gives the two men gold, land, and makes them both princes. The story ends with the marriage of the two princes, who live happily ever after in their own castle.  Development  Miles came up with the idea for The Princes and the Treasure during a visit to the Magic Kingdom, where he watched adult performers singing and dancing together as prince and princess couples. This caused him to note the absence of same sex pairings in children's fairy tales and upon returning home, began developing the story and characters. While writing the story Miles chose not to have the characters of Gallant and Earnest kiss, as he did not want the book to be seen as sexual, and he based the characters of both men on an amalgamation of people he knew in real life. He has also stated that he wanted the book to show that \\"two men or two women can create a warm and loving family together\\".  Characters  ;Prince Earnest :Earnest is a shy, red-haired bookworm that is hesitant to leave the safety of his own home, as he would rather read about adventures rather than go on one himself. He leaves his house only after his mother commands him to go and during his adventures with Gallant. Earnest tends to solve the challenges he faces by using his brains, and knowledge from the many adventure stories he has read. ;Prince Gallant :Gallant is the strongest and most handsome man in the kingdom of Evergreen, and is widely admired. Unlike Earnest, Gallant eagerly volunteers to rescue Princess Elena and during his adventures he tends to solve the challenges he faces by using his brawn and muscles ;Princess Elena :Elena is a beautiful, kind, warm, and funny princess. At the story's start she is pressured by her father to marry an eligible prince, which is not how Princess Elena wants to live her life. ;Enchantress / Old Woman :The Enchantress is initially portrayed as an old, weathered woman that whisks Elena away and sequesters her in a dark tower. When confronted by Earnest and Gallant she sets them on a task to bring her the \\"greatest treasure in the land\\", which sets them on a lengthy adventure. By the story's end she has revealed herself to be a beautiful enchantress capable of transforming her shape. ;King Rufus :Rufus is a caring and protective single father that wants his daughter to be happy in life. To this end he pressures Elena to marry a prince, as he believes that this would also secure the future well-being of their kingdom.  Reception  Critical reception for The Princes and the Treasure has been positive. The Princes and the Treasure has received praise from GLAAD, who expressed excitement over the work containing \\"gay role models, the twist on a classic fairytale storyline, and the shattering of stereotypes\\". Lesbians on the Loose gave the book a favorable review, stating that it was \\"important, particularly for children as it shows that love and family are universal, regardless of their gender.\\" Miles has also been approached by many parents, who use the book to discuss same sex relationships and marriage with their children. The book has received criticism from conservative groups such as the American Family Association for its placement in public libraries and schools.  Film adaptation  In November 2014 the satirical website Amplifying Glass posted a story claiming that Disney had picked up the rights to The Princes and the Treasure, which they would release under the title of Princes in the fall of 2015. The article went viral, causing many to assume that the claims were legitimate and share the news via various social media and news websites such as Facebook. The author of the piece stated that they did not intend for it to be taken seriously and that they had written the article in response to a comment made on an article by the Christian Post, which negatively compared homosexuality to eating disorders. The comment angered the author, who then wrote the article in order to \\"push the issue of equality a little and also, I admit, to troll some of the haters out there.\\" See also *King & King (2002) *Prince & Knight (2018)  References  Category:2014 children's books Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:American picture books Category:Children's books with LGBT themes Category:Same-sex marriage in fiction ","title":"The Princes and the Treasure"},{"id":"49439819","text":"Lithuanian National Association Hall, also known as the Tri-Cities Opera, is a historic clubhouse located at Binghamton, Broome County, New York.

The middle section, Kom‚ÄìEmine's highest, coincides with the Central Balkan National Park and regularly rises above . The highest point of the trail is Botev Peak (), which is also the highest summit of the Balkan Mountains. In total, around 100 individual peaks are either summited or circumvented. Typically, the Kom‚ÄìEmine hike takes 20 to 25 days to complete. The route is marked by white-red-white paint markings and around 30 mountain huts provide accommodation to hikers. Summer is the preferred season to walk Kom‚ÄìEmine, though the lowest, eastern parts of the trail can get uncomfortably hot. The trail was first successfully traversed in 1933 by the hiking pioneer Pavel Deliradev, though a route along the entire Balkan Mountains had already been conceived by writer Aleko Konstantinov, who was unable to embark on the hike before his assassination. The first mass through-hike was done in 1953 and the first winter crossing on ski followed in 1961. Bulgarian extreme runner Bozhidar Antonov holds the record for the fastest crossing of Kom‚ÄìEmine.

She has also featured in the media for several branding issues over the term, Uber.  Early life and education  Kriegner grew up in the village of Winklpoint in Austria. She started designing jewelry at age 10, which was an uncommon choice for a young girl from rural Austria. She was educated in Austria, going on to graduate with a master's degree as a goldsmith.  Career  After graduating from school, Kriegner made the decision to open her jewelry business in Austria, with her workshop based at her family home. Kriegner also spent some time in South Africa, where she learned various techniques involving gemstones, which would later play a large role in her jewelry business. She remained at the family home for 14 years, before moving to the Caribbean and then to the United States. Much of her early work was focused on custom designs for clients, with gems and gold combined into various jewelry pieces, such as rings and necklaces. In 2008, Kriegner finished in third position for the Jeweler In The Net Design Competition. She later attracted attention for the name of one of her 2008 ranges, which was titled Uber, which featured cocktail rings holding enclosed diamond wedding bands, altering the day-to-day look, and providing a new look for divorcees looking to reuse their rings. She eventually set up her business in Chelsea, New York City. Her designs, after moving to the United States, remained quite similar to former works, focusing predominantly on ring design. In 2010, she was featured in the book, 500 Gemstone Jewels, which was published by Lark Books. While forming her business, Uber Inc., Elena and her sister, Herta, shared an office space in New York City with a shared phone number. Uber did not have a local customer complaints number, which led to frequent misdialed calls from drivers and Uber users. The confusion with Uber became more of a problem for the sisters when they started to receive complex complaints from customers, such as driver harassment, as well as subpoenas. After speaking with Uber executives at the tradeshow, they were very dismissive of Elena and her sisters issues. The problems reached a point where the major New York City media covered Uber's lack of customer service in-depth, interviewing both Elena and her sister, Herta. In 2013, Kriegner's work featured at the Forbes jewelry exhibition, for ‚ÄúOut of this World‚Äù Jewelry. During the same year, she was also a finalist at the Jewelers Choice Awards 2013. Many of her jewelry pieces contain large gems. In June 2015, she featured in WAG magazine to discuss her new range, The Voyage Collection. During the interview, she spoke at length about the design of the jewelry, stating it came in a variety of price and cuts, and every item was convertible from a ring into a pendant. The jewelry collection received more coverage in the media after Kriegner revealed her latest ring innovation. The problem was that she noticed many complex ring designs were only available in the most common sizes, between 6-9. However the ring size range was from 3 to 14, meaning people at either end of the scale often had to buy custom rings, which could dramatically increase the cost. Kriegner's solution was to develop rings separately from the decorative designs, meaning the could be easily fitted, lowering inventory cost to stores that stocked her jewelry.  Personal life  Kriegner is an avid sailor and has sailed across the Atlantic and also across the United States, north to south, navigating rivers and lakes. When moving from Europe to the United States, she did so by captaining a 32 ft Catamaran and crossing the Atlantic ocean first. After spending time in the Caribbean, she eventually moved to New York City.

Early life and schooling  Born in Hope, Arkansas, at Julia Chester Hospital to Lenora R. Cross and James Calvin Cross (who was the youngest member of the General Staff in U.S. Army history), he grew up in Virginia, Texas, Rhode Island, France, and Germany. He attended the St. George‚Äôs School in Newport, Rhode Island, and the Paris-American High School, a Department-of-Defense-run school in France. At Princeton he belonged to the Charter Club and received an AB in sociology (1966). He served in the U.S. Army from 1968 to 1970, stationed primarily in Germany. In May 1970, the month of his discharge, he married Uta Bawey in Heidelberg. Cross returned to the U.S., attending Harvard Business School, receiving an MBA in 1974.  Career  1966-1968, NCR selling mainframe computers. 1976-1978, John Sperling hired Cross for an education startup created out of Sperling‚Äôs professorship at San Jose State University. Cross wrote a business course for Sperling, then a business degree program for what eventually became the University of Phoenix. Cross wrote in his eulogy of Sperling, ‚ÄúJohn told me he wanted our graduates to be able to talk like business people. It was a Turing test. Can you tell the accomplished business person from the recent winner of an accelerated degree?...While still in the midst of development, I hired and managed the sales force to sell it. Commission only. John was adamant that we were a profit-making business venture and needed to pay our bills as they came due.‚Äù 1978-1998, Omega Performance corporation, converting the organization from startup into an Inc 500 winner that trained a million banking professionals to make sound decisions and sell services. In 1998 Cross founded Internet Time Group to help the people in organizations learn. He joined together several colleagues (Jane Hart, Harold Jarche, Charles Jennings, and Clark Quinn) to form the Internet Time Alliance in 2008, which persists as a legacy. In 1998, frustrated with attention being placed on e-commerce for training, Cross said to a colleague, ‚ÄúPeople just don‚Äôt see it although it‚Äôs right in front of them. The next big thing in education isn't e-commerce, it's eeeeee-learning.‚Äù He began writing online about ‚Äúe-learning‚Äù that year. Because there are others who are said to have coined the term e-learning, Cross described his involvement by saying, ‚Äúthe term grew around him.\\" There are claims he coined the term as late as 2004. From 1999 to 2001, he worked closely with TPT Systems, which became CBT Systems, then SmartForce, then Skillsoft. In 2001, with colleagues Claudia Welss, Claudia L‚ÄôAmoreaux, and Clark Quinn, Cross created the Meta-Learning Lab, which believed that everyone has the capacity to learn but most people can do a much better job of it. Learning is a skill one can improve. Learning how to learn is a key to its mastery. From 2001 to 2003 Cross was CEO of Emergent Learning Forum (which began as the eLearning Forum), an 1,800-member society, think tank and advocacy group. For five years, this non-commercial community of people made decisions at the intersection of learning, technology, business, and design and participated in a global conversation of vital eLearning issues. Cross wrote his first significant paper on informal learning in 2003 (updated 2009). He first heard the phrase informal learning from the late Peter Henschel, the then director of the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), who said to Cross, ‚ÄúPeople are learning all the time, in varied settings and often most effectively in the context of work itself. Training ‚Äì formal learning of all kinds ‚Äì channels some important learning but doesn‚Äôt carry the heaviest load. The workhorse of the knowledge economy has been, and continues to be, informal learning.‚Äù Cross later abandoned the term informal learning in favor of \\"working smarter,‚Äù though he could never really step away from the original term because his book remains popular in the field. For a time Cross was managing director of Workflow Institute, which promoted the understanding of real-time enterprise-level learning in industry and government. He spoke often at events and conferences across the globe, including Europe, India, the Middle East, Australia, and more. The Oxford Debate on Informal in 2011 pitted several elearning leaders against one another to talk about its merits and drawbacks. Other events included Emergent Learning Forum, Online Learning, Training, Image World, Instructional Systems Association, ASTD International, eLearn International, Edge-X, Training Directors Forum, I-KNOW, Bank Marketing Association, and many other venues. He delivered the inaugural keynote on web marketing to the first meeting of the Online Banking Association. Cross became part of the steering committee for Online Educa, and had a lasting impact on the creation of the business stream with colleagues Laura Overton and Charles Jennings. He attended and spoke at almost every meeting during his lifetime. In March 2016, at their Learning Solutions conference, the eLearning Guild posthumously recognized Cross as a Guild Master, in honor of his contributions to the field. = Publications = He was also a prolific writer and published author. In addition to his widely read blogs, he was a columnist for Chief Learning Officer magazine and guest contributor to Learning in the New Economy magazine.

His interests also included design, photography, conceptual art, hiking, and the nature of time, technology. He was director and webmaster of the Berkeley Path Wanderers Association. In 2011 he began writing about the Berkeley Diet, focused on food-related news and featuring restaurants in the Berkeley California area. Called by many \\"the Johnny Appleseed of informal learning,\\" Cross was recognized for challenging assumptions, and challenged the entire corporate education field to see beyond the present to imagine what the future of learning could be. He was an advocate of using common sense to approach learning. He experimented, failed fast and often, and was always improving. He fought against pedagogy for pedagogy sake, explored the edges, and was always learning something new. He was constantly thinking about what was new on the horizon. His legacy lives on through the countless people he has inspired with his work.  Family / In Passing  After a lifetime of innovation and boundary pushing, Cross died at his home in the hills of Berkeley California on Nov. 6, 2015. He left behind wife Uta [Bawey] Cross, sons James Cross III and Austin Cross, and a miniature longhaired dachshund.

It is located in the Mier region in the Northern Cape Province, in South Africa, at above sea level. The pan covers an area of approximately 140 km2 (54mi2). Formation, geology and climate = Long-Term Landscape Evolution = The present day Kalahari landscape‚Äîessentially an inland sand sea sitting within an uplifted sedimentary basin‚Äîis the result of a variety of interacting tectonic and geomorphological processes that have operated over considerable timescales. The initial development of the Kalahari was closely linked to the evolution of the African landmass following the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwanaland during the Mesozoic. The gradual separation of Africa from present-day Australia, Antarctica, India and South America was associated with progressive heating and rifting of the crust, which led to the uplift of the southern African continental margin in the mid- to Late Cretaceous. The development of this uplifted margin had significant implications for regional fluvial systems; the end product was a dual drainage pattern consisting primarily of short rivers draining directly into the sea off the Great Escarpment and longer rivers draining inland and never reaching the sea. = Pan Environments = Pans are small, closed basins or depressions that contain seasonally flooded lakes and are characteristic of arid to semi-arid regions of low relief. They are also of considerable importance as point water sources for both humans and wildlife. Pans occur throughout the Kalahari, as far north as Zambia, but are a particularly significant component of the landscape in regions with (i) an annual rainfall of less than 500 mm and (ii) underlying rock or sediment that is susceptible to erosion by the wind. The southern Kalahari meets both of these criteria. Two areas containing concentrations of pans occur within the southern Kalahari: (i) a broad zone extending from Upington, across the lower Molopo and northwards into Namibia and (ii) a smaller area between Vryburg in North West Province and Tsabong in Botswana. Within these zones, pans occur as isolated landscape features but also within depressions in the floors of dry valleys and palaeodrainage lines, and in the corridors between linear dunes. The majority lack any surface inflow, although some may have short, poorly developed channels that supply run-off during major rainfall events. Hakskeen Pan is one of the largest isolated pans in the South African Kalahari, the other notable one being Koppieskraal Pan immediately south-west of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. = Climate = The climate in the Southern Kalahari ecoregion is semi-arid. Temperatures fluctuate greatly, on both a seasonal and a daily basis, with mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 35.7 ¬∞C and 19.5 ¬∞C in January and 22.2 ¬∞C and 1.2 ¬∞C in July. Rainfall is unreliable and irregular, falling primarily during short- duration, high intensity thunderstorms between November and April. Before the rainy season begins, strong northwesterly winds blow between September and November, producing dust storms. Mean annual precipitation is approximately 223mm. Humidity is low and evaporation high, the latter resulting in the characteristically large deficit in the annual water budget. River water tends to be alkaline and turbid, but the rivers flow only briefly after rainfall, and rapid infiltration into the sandy Kalahari soil means that floods, although they do at times occur, are rare, and river flow ceases quickly. Name In Afrikaans \\"Hakskeen\\" means ‚Äúheel‚Äù, which is probably a reference to the shape of the pan on a map. \\"Pan\\" is the Afrikaans word for \\"dry lake\\".  Land Speed Record Attempt  = Bloodhound LSR = The Bloodhound LSR team selected Hakskeen Pan to conduct their 1000 mph land speed record attempt after the rains in the Black Rock Desert failed so there was not enough water to wash the surface flat and the desert became the site of the Burning Man Festival which left deep scuff marks in the ground. After eliminating other sites which may be suitable for a land speed record attempt the team found Hakskeenpan which was selected due to its flat surface. The track that Bloodhound LSR will run on at Hakskeen Pan is 1100 metres wide and 20 km long. The date for the first land speed record attempt (to improve on the current record of 763 mph) has been set to 2020, with high speed trials starting October 2019. The aim of the Bloodhound project is to set a land speed record of 1000 mph; this attempt has been scheduled for 2020. The Bloodhound supersonic car project to race a car at more than 1000 mph had been axed after it failed to secure a ¬£25m cash injection. On December 17th 2018 the project was saved by a cash injection from a Yorkshire-based entrepreneur for an undisclosed amount.

During his tenure at Oberlin, Root became the premier spokesperson for college librarianship during his era. He led the growth of Oberlin's collection through gifts and exchange programs and by 1924 had established Oberlin's library as the largest college library in the nation. Root was also a leader in the library profession. He was a founding member of the American Library Association's College Library Section in 1899 (precursor of the Association of College and Research Libraries) and a founding member of the Bibliographical Society of America.

He won in 1972 the first prize of Plan Architecture Nouvelle No. 1 (P.A.N., now called Europan) and opened his practice in 1975 by realizing this competition project.  Biography  Graduated in 1958 from the Warsaw Polytechnic University with an engineering degree in architecture, Christophe Lukasiewicz was about to complete a double degree at the Warsaw Academia Sztuk Pieknych (Ecole des Beaux Arts). Thus he met a friend, the painter Fangor, today recognized for his visual work, (Visual art and kinetic art). He also, during his studies, worked for the architect Georges Soltan (close to Team 10 designs). He offered him to work in Paris. Assistant at the School of Fine Arts in Paris, he worked with Jozef i Ewa Brukalski as project manager in the office of the architect and professor Emile Aillaud. Author of a large number of city plans, Christophe Lukasiewicz developed a new design of the Town Planning: parks and gardens surrounded by terraced buildings, shopping streets and markets. He developed the classic city plan (London crescent) or garden city plan seeking to build a city resulting from a millennium urbanisation (diversity of scenery, withdrawal alignment, arcades, terraces). Using industrial prefabrication process, he created an aesthetic in which useful constructions becomes decorative by his play (See Melun-Senart The arcades ILM). With this project, he initiated the creation of a cubist city. He used during these projects all forms of architecture that connect with the environment and nature: patio, balcony, terraces, winder gardens and bay-windows around trees and green spaces. Painter, like his father, Stanislas Lukasiewicz, architect of the mid-century in Warsaw, he had represented the environment to recreate it. He is the author of the footbridge and lifts that allow access to the Jardin Atlantique above the Gare Montparnasse in Paris (see architecture mobile). He suggested applying its garden town planning to the Paris density. He produced a functional, human and cultural design for the city (according to English biography of Ch. Lukasiewicz), proposing the restoration of a mansion or new layout for the Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es, with his friend and architect Andre Schuch (architect of all new kiosk for newspapers in Paris) . At the very end of his life and returning to Warsaw, he created in Wolomin, near Warsaw, a city generated by successive acquisitions with the same alternate architectures which give character to houses and creates urban unity. At the same time, Christophe Lukasiewicz wrote an architectural treaty (not published) completing his first book, Urbanisme des places et des rues (first book). \\"In architecture forms result from the need of shelter, the search of economic and of human comfort\\" Christophe Lukasiewicz, architecture Treaty, circa 1994.

It was launched on 16 February 2016 as a replacement for the linear BBC Three television channel, which was discontinued the same day. The service produces and streams television and web series aimed at the demographic of 16 to 34-year-olds, with a particular focus on comedy and documentary programming. The replacement of BBC Three's television service with a digital platform came as the result of budget cuts at the broadcaster, stemming from Director-General Tony Hall's goal to not perform general cuts across the BBC that would compromise the quality of its programme output, and an acknowledgement of a shift in viewing habits among the service's demographic towards online video services as opposed to linear television channels. Likewise, BBC Three staff argued that the service would no longer be bound to the limitations of linear television, enabling producers to have a larger degree of flexibility in the programme content they can create for BBC Three. BBC Three content is primarily streamed on BBC iPlayer, while the service's other content, including web series and other materials, are also distributed through presences on social networks. All full-length original programming commissioned for BBC Three must eventually be broadcast on the linear BBC One and BBC Two television channels following their online premiere. Beginning in March 2019, BBC One introduced a dedicated timeslot for BBC Three programmes on Mondays through Wednesdays following the BBC News at Ten. Research released in September 2020 showed that BBC Three was being viewed for 89% less time per-year since the closure of its linear broadcast platform, and 72% if rebroadcasts of its content on other BBC linear channels were included. In the year after it closed its linear broadcast platform its weekly audience of viewers aged 16‚Äì34 declined 69% compared with the year before the closure. On 20 May 2020, it was announced within the BBC's annual plan that the corporation is \\"considering the case\\" for returning BBC Three to linear television, four years after it was taken off air. The annual plan also stated that the BBC would be \\"backing the success\\" of the channel by doubling its budget, after producing a variety of critically acclaimed series including Normal People, Fleabag and This Country.  History  = Proposal = In February 2014 at the Oxford Media Conference, BBC Director-General Tony Hall stated that as part of the ongoing \\"Delivering Quality First\\" initiative at the corporation (which, as motivated by the government freeze of television license fee costs, aims to reach ¬£700 million in cost-savings across the BBC up to the end of the 2016‚Äì17 television season), the BBC was in the process of finalizing plans to make another ¬£100 million in cuts to be announced the following month. Believing that general budget cuts across the entire corporation would compromise the quality of its in-house productions‚Äîespecially dramas, which he described as being the \\"essence\\" of the BBC‚ÄîHall stated that these cuts could require \\"hard decisions\\" to be made. He explained that the corporation had \\"reached the point where salami-slicing would affect quality and distinctiveness. Rather than seek to preserve a less good version of our past, we decided to focus on what we do best: from drama to taking iPlayer into the next generation.\\" On 5 March 2014, the BBC announced several cost-savings proposals, subject to the approval of the BBC Trust. Among them were plans to discontinue BBC Three as a television channel, and convert it into an online service. In its proposal, the BBC stated that while motivated by financial considerations, the conversion was a \\"future- facing move\\" that would \\"develop a ground-breaking new online service which will bring high quality, distinctive UK-originated long form and new form interactive content to 16‚Äì34 year olds\\", and take advantage of the increased use of online services by the channel's target demographics. It was outlined that the service would have to leverage the \\"strengths\\" of BBC Three, such as curation, original productions, and \\"best-in-class storytelling\\", and adapt them to the \\"immediacy\\" and interactivity of digital. As the service would not be bound to the limitations of linear schedules, the scope of the new BBC Three would fall under three \\"editorial pillars\\" as opposed to programming genres: \\"Make Me Laugh\\" reflects comedic and \\"personality-driven\\" programmes, and \\"Make Me Think\\" reflects current affairs, drama, and other factual programming. A third pillar, \\"Give Me a Voice\\", reflects that the service's content would be of topical interest to the 16‚Äì to 34-year-old demographic, and would encourage discussion and participation‚Äîespecially via social media. The overall programming budget of the service would be reduced by nearly half in comparison to the BBC Three channel. While it would have a larger focus on short-form web series, the service planned to continue investments into commissioning long-form programmes and \\"comedy at near current levels\\", and serving as an incubator for new talent. The service's output would primarily be delivered through iPlayer, but plans called for a revamped \\"branded space\\" to showcase the content, as well distributing short-form productions via alternative outlets such as YouTube. The proposal faced criticism from notable parties, including Greg James, Matt Lucas and Jack Whitehall. Media writer Roy Greenslade considered the change to be \\"unquestionably the most sensible or perhaps the least worst\\" way of cutting costs. While admitting BBC Three's recent success in targeting its demographic and its role as a launchpad for new talent, he argued that BBC Three was \\"a marginal channel with a small share of the overall television audience\\", and that \\"'Hard decisions' are just that. If the BBC is to have any hope of sustaining its quality core output then a sacrifice had to be made.\\" = Approval and launch = The transition was finalised by the BBC Trust in November 2015. The Trust cited the shifting viewing habits of BBC Three's target audience from linear TV to digital services, and that the discontinuation of BBC Three as a television channel would allow the BBC to \\"deliver more distinctive content online, while bearing down on costs\\". Conditions were imposed on other BBC properties to complement the changes; BBC One and Two will be required to develop \\"distinctive programmes designed for younger audiences\\", as well as air repeats of all full-length programmes commissioned for BBC Three. The Trust also approved related proposals to allow first-run and third-party content on iPlayer, and extend CBBC's broadcast day to 9:00 p.m (CBBC signed off at 7:00 p.m to conserve Freeview bandwidth for BBC Three) with a focus on an older youth audience. On 4 January 2016, it was announced that the new BBC Three digital service would launch on 16 February 2016. The same day, a new logo for the service was unveiled. Inspired by the iconography of mobile applications, the new logo incorporates the Roman numeral for the number 3, with the third bar replaced by an exclamation mark. Marketing head Nikki Carr explained that the three bars represented the aforementioned \\"editorial pillars\\" (with the exclamation mark representing the \\"Give Me a Voice\\" aspect). The new logo received mixed reactions from the public, with some drawing comparisons to the album cover of Plan B's Ill Manors, a Roman numeral \\"2\\" with an exclamation point (\\"BBC Two!\\"), and a proposed redesign of the BBC's logo seen in an episode of the comedy W1A. In regards to the W1A comparison, Carr joked that \\"thanks to W1A we're cursed at the BBC when it comes to marketing and I don't want to come across all Siobhan Sharpe but forgive me some lingo.\\" The channel also parodied the comparisons in a Vine video. BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh explained that the new digital service would feature the \\"same award- winning programmes freed from the constraints of linear TV\\", emphasizing the ability to distribute content across \\"whatever format and platform is most appropriate\\". Hall described the internal atmosphere surrounding the new BBC Three as being like a \\"startup\\", explaining that \\"I love the feeling of going and being with Damian's team. It feels creative, energetic and mischievous as well, just as it should be.\\" Kavanagh felt that the concise \\"pillars\\" of BBC Three, combined with its new structure, would give creators more flexibility and immediacy in how they produce content. He explained that \\"we can allow people to do things that I don't think other broadcasters can really do at the moment‚Äîin terms of giving people room to try things and also play around with form in a way we couldn‚Äôt have done if we'd stayed on television\\", with the remainder of the BBC's content ecosystem as a \\"safety net\\". Kavanagh also emphasized a continued goal to use the service as an incubator for new talent, hoping that it will be remembered as \\"the place that spotted the next James Corden, the next Aidan Turner, the next whoever.\\" On 13 February 2016, prior to the service's launch, it was reported that the BBC was considering merging BBC Three and BBC Radio 1 under unified management if the digital BBC Three service is not successful. Kavanagh stated that he himself was unaware of this proposal, but added that BBC Three was \\"a really powerful youth brand with 13 years' heritage\\" and that he \\"[didn't] see the logic in winding down something that has that audience, and has that badge of quality, and has that heritage.\\" The BBC Three television channel formally signed off during the early morning of 16 February 2016, concurrent with the official re-launch of the new BBC Three. The last programme aired was an episode of Gavin & Stacey, introduced by its co-star James Corden from the set of his current U.S. chat show The Late Late Show in Los Angeles.  Content  The new BBC Three service is delivered primarily via iPlayer, offering new, original content, as well as full series of previous BBC Three programmes (branded as \\"Box Sets\\"). New content consists of full-length programmes, and short-form web series and features; Kavanagh explained that the new BBC Three would focus primarily on original comedies and documentaries. All long-form programmes commissioned for BBC Three must be aired at a later date on BBC One or BBC Two. In February 2019, it was announced that BBC Three programmes would air Mondays through Wednesdays on BBC One on following the News at Ten, beginning on 4 March 2019. Despite the refocus on comedy, the proportion of the channel‚Äôs output (in minutes) devoted to comedy actually fell post-switch, from 41% to 33%. By contract, the proportions of the channel‚Äôs output devoted to factual programming did increase. BBC Three produces two curated content channels, such as The Daily Drop‚Äîwhich features blogs, videos, photo galleries, social network content, and other content trending online‚Äîand The Best Of. 20% of the outlet's budget will go towards web series. Programmes from the former BBC Three channel were carried over, including new series of Cuckoo, Life and Death Row and People Just Do Nothing. The initial slate of new programs to debut through BBC Three included the Doctor Who spin-off Class (which was cancelled after a single series), the new dramas Clique and Thirteen, Live from the BBC, a stand-up comedy series focusing on up and coming comedians; the three-part web series The Man Who Witnessed 219 Executions; and Unsolved: The Boy Who Disappeared. Promoted as being a British equivalent to the web series Serial, Unsolved would feature weekly installments investigating a real-life crime story. The service will also produce a series of short films in collaboration with Idris Elba and up and coming talent. In 2017, the millennial relationship series Just a Couple premiered With the service's budget cut to ¬£30 million, some of BBC Three's historic staples, such as panel shows, Don't Tell the Bride, and U.S. animated comedy Family Guy were dropped. Some BBC Three series had already been moved to other outlets in anticipation of the shutdown; Russell Howard's Good News was moved to BBC Two in 2014, and Don't Tell the Bride was moved to BBC One for a single series before being dropped and acquired by Sky 1. ITV2 acquired rights to new episodes of Family Guy and other Seth MacFarlane series in March 2015, although the BBC continued to hold rights to past episodes of Family Guy until 2017. The annual minutes of programming being made available by BBC Three on iPlayer after the channel closed its broadcast platform was around 80% less than the annual minutes of programming broadcast before the closure. The comedy-drama Fleabag premiered on BBC Three in 2016, and was renewed for a second series premiering in 2019. The series achieved critical acclaim, with its second series receiving 11 nominations at the 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards (on behalf of U.S. co-production partner Amazon Video) and winning in six categories‚Äîincluding Outstanding Comedy Series. In 2019, BBC Three aired RuPaul's Drag Race UK. In 2020, it was announced that BBC Three had acquired UK broadcast rights to Canada's Drag Race.Kelly Townsend, \\"Canada‚Äôs Drag Race sashays away to the U.K.\\". Playback, June 15, 2020.

She was sentenced to five years of incarceration. Bagavutdinova has been named a political prisoner by several NGOs, citing contradictory facts presented as evidence and lack of material evidence. Human rights groups note that Bagavutdinova had made several critical remarks about Russian security services prior to her arrest.  Activism  A map of Dagestan The Northern Caucasus region of Dagestan contains dozens of ethnic groups and languages.[22] It has been dogged by conflicts between the Islamic Sufis, who recognise the state, and Salafis, who reject secular rule.[22] This conflict has led Dagestan to the highest levels of violence in the North Caucasus republics.[23][24] The Russian Interior Ministry stated that of the 399 terrorist crimes in the North Caucasus in 2013, 242 were in Dagestan.[25] Bagavutdinova's work with Pravozashchita documented and publicized human rights concerns related to Salafi causes. The group had been placed under surveillance and some members of the group had been searched. Charges and imprisonment Dagestani police forces charge Bagavutdinova \\"maintained close kinship and friendship relations with active members of the 'Buynaksk Jamaat', was actively engaged in propaganda of the 'Salafi' trend of Islam, known as 'Wahhabism', and involved in recruiting individuals to join [illegal armed forces].\\" Several human rights groups have stated concerns with the way this trial was conducted. The court found its verdict on the testimony of five secret witnesses, two of which were prisoners found with weapons in their homes. One later recanted his testimony. They initially testified that Mamma Dalgatov, a Dagestani, met Bagavutdinova in the department store where she worked. According to the court, Bagavutdinova told Dalgatov to fight jihad against the government. The court claimed that Bagavutdinova cultivated a friendship and promised to marry Dalgatov if he joined the insurgency. Dalgatov was killed in an anti-terrorist action in 2013. International response The Institute of Modern Russia and Memorial, a human rights group which Russia has called a \\"foreign agent,\\" have called Bagavutdinova a political prisoner. The group Human Rights Watch has called Bagavutdinova's trial \\"politically motivated and unfair.\\" Human rights groups say that the secret witnesses gave contradictory descriptions of the person alleged to be Bagavutdinova. This included different heights and ages. One witness later recanted his testimony, stating he had made his statements under pressure. Witnesses report that Bagavutdinova had previously been harassed by local authorities for her work on human rights campaigns in the area. They also argue that holding the entire trial behind closed doors is a violation of her human rights. Russian officials have stated that there is no state process for convicting a person for a political crime. The Moscow Helsinki Group, the oldest human rights organization in Russia, argue that while there are no laws against political crimes, there have been cases of politically motivated charges.

Early life and education Benjamin F. Shobe was born on October 2, 1920, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and spent most of his life in Louisville, Kentucky. His parents were both educators. His father, Walter L. Shobe, was the Dean of Men at Kentucky State College and later principal of a high school for blacks. Anna L. Shobe, his mother, was an elementary school teacher who taught Benjamin for a time. Shobe had one older brother, Dr. Walter Shobe. Benjamin F. Shobe earned a bachelor's degree in 1941 from Kentucky State College (now Kentucky State University), a historically black school in Frankfort. While in college, Shobe, along with his brother Walter, was inducted into the Tau Sigma Honor Society for his academic excellence. Shobe was an active member of the debating team. One of his professors, Dr. Henry E. Cheaney, encouraged him to pursue a career in law. Shobe wanted to pursue a law degree at a school in Kentucky such as the University of Louisville or the University of Kentucky, but state law prohibited African Americans from attending graduate or professional schools in Kentucky. Under the Anderson-Mayer Bill, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was required to pay tuition and fees for African Americans to attend graduate and professional schools at out-of-state institutions. The state paid the tuition and fees for Shobe to attend the University of Michigan Law School (Ann Arbor campus). While in law school, Shobe was selected for mentorship in the Society of Barristers. He graduated from the University of Michigan with his law degree in 1946 and returned to Louisville, Kentucky to practice as a trial attorney. Career After spending three years as an associate in the law firm of Charles Anderson, Shobe began his own practice. As a civil rights attorney for the NAACP, Shobe worked with Thurgood Marshall (who later became the first black US Supreme Court Justice), James Nabritt, and James A. Crumlin to integrate the University of Kentucky in 1949. These attorneys represented Lyman T. Johnson, a black student who could not attend the university's graduate school because he was black. Shobe and his fellow attorneys won the case, Lyman T. Johnson v. University of Kentucky, paving the way for minorities to attend the university's graduate and professional schools. In 1951, Shobe partnered with attorneys James A. Crumlin and Robert L. Carter to represent plaintiffs in Sweeney v. City of Louisville. Shobe and his team made successful arguments and won the case in the federal courts. As a result of Shobe's work, public parks in Louisville, Kentucky were desegregated. On January 6, 1953, Judge Frank Ropke appointed Shobe to the Jefferson Circuit Court, making him the first African American to serve as a judge in Kentucky since Reconstruction. Shobe served as a hearing officer for the Workman's Compensation Board, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for eight years, and a Trial Commissioner. At the request of the Kentucky Secretary of Justice, Shobe traveled throughout Kentucky training lawyers on the state's criminal code. In 1972, Shobe appointed Olga Peers, who would later become the first female Circuit Court Judge in Kentucky, to the old Louisville Police Court. In November 1976, Governor Julian Carroll appointed Shobe to serve as the Chief Judge of the 15th Division of the Jefferson Circuit Court. Shobe was the first African American to be appointed as a Chief Judge, serving with honor until his retirement in 1992. For several years after his retirement from the bench, Shobe served as an Alternative Dispute Resolution Specialist for Retired Judges and Associates. Civic and religious engagement Shobe served as President as the Louisville Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. A life member of the National Urban League, Shobe also joined Ye Olde Esquires, Inc. Shobe joined Portland Memorial Baptist Church in 1978 where he served as a Deacon and Sunday School teacher. Awards and honors In 1992, Shobe was honored by the Louisville Bar Association as Judge of the Year. The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights inducted Shobe into the Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians as its 42nd honoree in 2006. Shobe received the Nathaniel A. Harper Diversity Award from the Kentucky Bar Association in 2012. Death Shobe died at the age of 95 on January 29, 2016. Funeral services were held at Portland Memorial Baptist Church on February 8, 2016. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate Shobe's life at his funeral. Ministers and community leaders spoke highly of Shobe's love of God and his family as well as his commitment to serving others. Attorneys and judges from across Kentucky paid tribute to Shobe for his kindness, integrity, and brilliance. Chief Justice John D. Minton of the Kentucky Supreme Court lauded Shobe's character and accomplishments. A letter honoring Shobe from US President Barack Obama was read. The American Flag at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, was flown at half-mast in honor of Shobe on the day of his funeral. Legacy In 2006, the Louisville Bar Association and the Louis D. Brandeis American Inns of Court at Louisville Association developed the Judge Shobe Civility and Professionalism Award to recognize Louisville Bar Association members \\"whose lives and careers embody professionalism, civility, honesty and courtesy\\" ‚Äì all trademarks portrayed by Shobe throughout his career, association officials said. About his life, [Shobe] says, \\"I was always willing to try, I was never going to back down, I was willing to take the challenge, win, lose, or draw.\\" In 2012, the Louisville Black Lawyers Association and the Kentucky Court of Justice sponsored the dedication of the Circuit Judge Benjamin F. Shobe Jury Assembly Room in the Jefferson County Judicial Center. The Kentucky Bar Association will honor Shobe posthumously at its 2016 Annual Convention. Shobe mentored attorneys and judges throughout his life. For years after his retirement, colleagues visited and consulted him for advice and support. In a joint resolution, the Kentucky state legislature honored the memory of the late jurist by designating the I-264 overpass over Northwestern Parkway in Jefferson County as the \\"Judge Benjamin Shobe Memorial Overpass\\" in 2017. Judge Shobe is survived by his wife of 43 years, Barbara Kirby-Shobe, his ten children, one adopted son, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Sources * A.D.

Always on the leading edge of fashion, Holland & Sons employed some of England's foremost designers and participated in all of the International Exhibitions of 1851, 1855, 1862, 1867, 1872 and 1878. Holland and Sons also participated in many of the leading international exhibitions including London in 1862, Vienna in 1873 and Paris in 1867 and 1872. After a brief period in which the company was known as Taprell, Holland & Son c.1835-43, William Holland gained sole command after the senior partner Taprell's retirement. From 1843 onwards they were known as Holland and Sons. The relationship between builder and cabinet maker is similar to another leading Victorian firm, Trollope and Sons. Their earliest known commission was to furnish the Athenaeum Club, London, 1824- 1838. They also worked alongside the prestigious firm of Thomas Dowbiggin at Osborne House, and eventually took over their premises and business at 23 Mount Street, London in 1851 and 1853 respectively. In 1851, when the company was based in Mount Street and employed 351 people, they won a prize at the Great Exhibition for a bookcase. By then, after being granted a Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom) early in the reign of Queen Victoria, they had already taken a leading part in the decoration and furnishing of Osborne House, Sandringham House, Balmoral Castle, Windsor Castle and the apartments of the Prince and Princess of Wales at Marlborough House, executing numerous exceptional pieces of furniture. Holland and Sons also executed over three hundred separate commissions for the British Government, including the Palace of Westminster, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and oversaw the State funeral of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. One of their celebrated private commissions was a suite of bedroom furniture for the late Sir Harold Augustus Wernher, 3rd Baronet at Luton Hoo. During the latter half of the 19th century, Holland and Sons also supplied furniture for such notable London clubs as the Reform Club and the Oxford and Cambridge Club. Along with Gillows they shared the commission for the new Palace of Westminster.

Aukh encompasses parts of the Novolak, Khasavyurtovsky Babayurtovsky and Kazbekovsky districts. The Chechens of Dagestan call themselves Aukhovites, and speak a sub dialect of the Galanchozh dialect.  Historical Inhabitants of Aukh  Aukh was always inhabited by Chechen tribes and were mentioned by several sources of the time as Okoki, Kachkalyki, Gueni, Michkizi and others. The Kumyk General and writer Devlet-Mirza Shikhaliev wrote in 1848 that one of the most ancient inhabitants of Endirey(one of the oldest and biggest settlements in Aukh) were the Gueni who he considered to be Chechen(from the teip Gunoy).https://e-libra.su/read/532280-rasskaz-kumyka-o-kumykah.html Aukh was very mixed with a lot of different Chechen Teips from all areas of Chechnya and Ingushetia, due to this the tribes living there had several different names in Russian sources. All of them recognized themselves as Nakhchoy (Chechens) as can be attested by the letter to the inhabitants of Endirey in 1756 by the Sala-Uzden prince Adzhi who in his letter calls all of the inhabitants \\"Nation of Nakhshai\\".  History  = Okotsk Lands = Aukh in the upper right (Russian: –û–∫–æ—Ü–∫–∞—è –∑–µ–º–ª—è) is an Old Russian term used by the Russian Tsardom to denote a Chechen feudal state, which they encountered in the 16th century. Okotsk was one of the biggest and most influential states in the North Caucasus, and had a rivalry with the other polities of Dagestan, particularly the Kumyk controlled Shamkalate of Tarki. It distinguished itself by being in opposition to Persian, Ottoman and Crimean hegemony over the North Caucasus, allying itself with the Russian Tsardom instead. The Knyaz Shikh Okotsky commanded at some point a host of 500 Cossacks and 500 Chechens (Aukhovites), although the 500 Aukhovites were part of a larger immobilized Chechen force of 1000 infantry and 100 mounted cavalry.

In 1843 the Aukh Naib district was one of the most important Naibstva, it had up to 1500 families and could equally supply 1500 soldiers to the Caucasian Imamate. In another report from 1857 Aukh under Naib Hatu had in total 530 warriors or which 200 were cavalry and 330 infantry. http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Kavkaz/XIX/1800-1820/Dvizenie/201-220/219.htmhttp://www.vostlit.info/Texts/Dokumenty/Kavkaz/XIX/1840-1860/Karta_Shamil_1273/text.htm Another famous Naib of Aukh was Bashir-Sheikh from Endirey who belonged to the famous Endirey nobility called Sala-Uzden. Bashir Sheikh was in 1834 considered as a candidate for the leadership of the Imamate but declined due to his injury that made one of his legs lame. = Administrative Dispute = In 1921, Aukh was included in the Dagestan ASSR, despite the desire of Aukhovites to join the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. According to another explanation, the reason was the entering Aukhovites fear of losing their winter pastures in the territory of the Khasavyurtovsky District. In 1943, the territory was incorporated into the Aukh district, which only lasted til February 1944, when Aukhovite Chechens were ethnically cleansed from their homeland along with the rest of the Chechen nation. Part of Aukh was incorporated into the new Novolaksy district and the property and houses of the ethnically cleansed Chechens, were given to Laks free of charge. The villages Shircha-Aukh (Kalininaul) and Aukh-Aktash (Leninaul) were transferred to the Kazbekovski District and the property there was given to Avars. In 1956, Chechens began to return to their historical homeland, widespread ethnic conflict ensued.  Ethnic cleansing  DASSR, hence the name Novolak district, New Lak district. With the permission of the authorities of the Soviet Dagestan, on October 5, 1943, the Aukhovites formed their national Aukhov district (the territory of the modern Novolaksky and part of the Kazbekovsky regions) with the center in Yaryksu-Aukh (modern Novokuli). But at the end of February 1944, the Aukhovites, sharing a similar fate with other Vainakhs, were ethnically cleansed from their homeland. The authorities disbanded the Aukh district, giving the land of Aukhovites to other ethnic groups of Dagestan. In the period from 1957 to 1960, the majority of Aukhovites returned to the Soviet Dagestan, however, the leadership of the republic forbade them to resettle the land of their ancestors, especially in the Novolaksky and Kazbekovsky districts (only a few successfully repatriated). Due to restrictions, Aukhovites began to settle in other settlements of the republic, which the authorities indicated to them (legislatively, this ban was enacted by a resolution of the Council of Ministers of the DASSR on July 16, 1958). Until 1961, Aukhovites fought for their return to their native places of residence after which under the threat of a new ethnic cleansing, they had to temporarily abandon their claims. Monument in honor of the Chechen-Aukhovites that were affected by Aardakh. Aukhovites never abandoned attempts to return their former dwellings occupied by Avars and Laks. The resulting interethnic tension led to clashes, sometimes with tragic consequences. In 1964, Aukhovites made another attempt to return to their native homeland, acting in an organized manner and emphasizing the peaceful nature of their action. The leadership of the Soviet Dagestan was confused and declared these actions ‚Äúriots‚Äù, although no repressive measures were taken against the participants in the events then. Once again, Aukhovites tried to return to their homes in 1976 and 1985 in the village of Chapaevo (Chech. Keshen-Evla), and in 1989 in many native Aukh villages. In response to these actions, the local party leadership began to turn the Avars and Laks against the Aukhovites. On July 3, 1989, a rally was organized demanding the renewed cleansing of Aukhovites from Dagestan.

Founded by William Findlay \\"Billy\\" Maclean, it was popular among Toronto's working class and similar in style to The New York Herald. It was said to be the \\"editorially boldest\\" of the Toronto press, and was notable for its irreverence, noisy expos√©s of civic corruption, skilful skirting of the libel laws, and opposition to the religious establishment. Journalists such as Hector Charlesworth, Joseph E. Atkinson and John Bayne Maclean first worked there, before moving on to senior positions at other publications. It once declared that \\"A newspaper editorially has no inherent personality of its own nor apart from that of the individuals who direct and control its policy. That is the basic element in journalism, though it is often forgotten or ignored by the public to whom it is of vital interest.\\" History During the 1880 byelection for West Toronto, Maclean was approached by city alderman Peter Ryan to form an evening newspaper to support his campaign as the Liberal candidate. At that time city editor for The Globe, Maclean and two other Globe reporters founded The World. Although originally intended to last just for that campaign period, Maclean liked it enough to continue publication afterwards as a morning newspaper. =Scoops= When the World published rumours in 1894 about the health of Prime Minister Sir John Thompson (which were subsequently confirmed by reports of his fatal heart attack at Windsor Castle), fellow Tories felt he had tried to destroy the party by making it look vulnerable and never forgave him. In a 1905 expos√©, it reported that the Globe was being used by Robert Jaffray and George Cox to pressure the government of James Whitney to approve a grant of a third franchise by the Niagara Parks Commission (on which Jaffray was a commissioner) to the Electrical Development Company of Ontario (of which Cox was a director). It also reported that the State of Michigan was investigating the illegal use by Cox of trust money held by Canada Life, and that the Globe, the Star and the News went out of their way to support Canada Life's activities. =Espousal of populist causes= The World was a champion of many causes, including: :* criticizing the government of Oliver Mowat in the mid-1880s over its handling of liquor licensing and other issues; :* campaigning from 1894 for, and achieving a successful result in, an 1897 referendum that allowed Toronto's streetcars to operate on Sundays; :* campaigning in 1907 for the creation of what would later become Toronto Hydro, in order to provide a competitor for the Toronto Electric Light Company; :* support for subways, suffrage, and the Bloor Viaduct. During most of this time, Maclean was also a nominally Conservative MP in the House of Commons of Canada, first for York East for 1892 to 1904, and then for York South from 1904 to 1926. Known for being unpredictably independent, he campaigned in the House and the World for a Bank of Canada, a national currency, the public ownership of railways, hydroelectricity, and telephones, a uniform passenger rate on trains, the rejection of reciprocity, a Canadian-made constitution and a Canadian head of state. He also supported Sir Wilfrid Laurier's naval policy in 1910. =Scandals= The World was caught up in several scandals of its own making: . :* In 1911, the Globe claimed that the World had solicited deposits for the \\"rotten\\" Farmers' Bank of Canada in exchange for its financial support. :* Maclean's campaign for the construction of the Bloor Viaduct was compromised by his ownership of a farm west of the Don River valley. =The Sunday World= American Sunday newspapers became popular in Toronto in the 1880s, with the Buffalo Express even beginning a Canadian edition in 1887, but the Lord's Day Act prevented any local Sunday papers from being printed or sold on that day. By arranging for printing and distribution on Saturday night (but with a Sunday date), The Sunday World began circulation on Victoria Day, May 24, 1891, to compete against the popular Saturday weekend editions being issued by The Globe and The Daily Mail. In 1895 it described itself as \\"the brightest, crispest, most cosmopolitan, most interesting of Canadian weeklies.\\" Initially printed as an eight-page broadsheet, it was converted into a 24-page tabloid on January 20, 1901. It later added a half tone broadsheet supplement in 1902. =Relationships with other Toronto papers= When John A. Macdonald fell out with The Toronto Mail in 1887, he considered buying The World, but decided not to proceed when Maclean insisted on remaining as its editor in chief. Macdonald then went on to form The Toronto Empire. The Toronto Star was first printed on World presses, and at its formation in 1892 The World owned a 51% interest in it as a silent partner. That arrangement only lasted for two months, during which time it was rumoured that Maclean was considering selling the Star to the Riordon family. After an extensive fundraising campaign among the Star staff, Maclean agreed to sell his interest to Horatio Clarence Hocken. =Financial difficulties= The World always experienced cash flow problems during its existence, as Maclean drew profits from it to fund his other interests as a politician, horse breeder, and land speculator. The Globe described him as being the \\"poorest of business men,\\" but in 1913 the Canadian Courier described him as \\"the only newspaper proprietor who was ever unable to pay all salaries regularly and publish a paper and remain popular.\\" His need for cash led some to believe that his editorial views were for sale: :* Following the 1897 Sunday streetcar referendum, the World was rewarded by the Toronto Railway Company; :* In return for purchasing large volumes of advertising, the World would write puff pieces about the advertisers; :* In 1902, it was rumoured that Joseph Flavelle was considering purchasing the World for $350,000, being $50,000 for the newspaper itself and $300,000 for \\"goodwill\\". Closure In March 1920, creditors forced the World to go into liquidation. There were rumours that it would be sold, with possible buyers said to include the United Farmers of Ontario and the Southam newspaper chain, but the daily edition was closed in 1921, with all assets sold to The Mail and Empire. The Sunday World was later sold to The Toronto Star in 1924 to be merged with the Star Weekly. Toronto would not have a Sunday newspaper again until The Toronto Telegram published Sunday editions for a few months in 1957, followed by a more successful introduction by The Toronto Sun of a continuing Sunday edition beginning in 1973.

It was released on Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One worldwide in February 2016. In Layers of Fear, the player controls a psychologically disturbed painter who is trying to complete his magnum opus as he navigates a Victorian mansion revealing secrets about his past. The gameplay, presented in first-person perspective, is story-driven and revolves around puzzle-solving and exploration. Layers of Fear: Inheritance was released on 2 August 2016 as a direct follow up add-on to the first game. This time the player controls the painter's daughter with the downloadable content focusing on her apparent relapse into trauma after returning to her old house. A definitive port for the Nintendo Switch, entitled Layers of Fear: Legacy, was released on 21 February 2018 and it features, in addition to the Inheritance DLC, Joy-Con, touchscreen, and HD Rumble support. A limited physical retail release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, published by Limited Run Games in North America, would be available starting October 2018. A sequel titled Layers of Fear 2 was announced in October 2018 and was released on May 29, 2019. Gameplay The player takes control of an artist who has returned to his studio. His initial goal is to complete his masterpiece, and the player's role is to figure out how this task should be accomplished. The challenge comes from puzzles which require the player to search the environment for visual clues. The house appears straightforward at first, but it changes around the player as they explore it in first person. These changes in the environment provide scaffolding for the puzzles and provide regular jump scares common to games of this genre. The game is divided into six chapters with various items for the player to find in order to complete his work. The game is heavily dimmed, and there are objects that uncover certain aspects of the painter's history. While completing the painting, there is a letter that is slowly pieced together, which shows the origin of his masterpiece, and objects which explain the secret of the painter through dialogue flashbacks. Plot Set in the 1920s United States, the unnamed protagonist returns home from a court hearing. After briefly exploring his empty house, he goes to his workshop to start working on his \\"magnum opus\\". After he adds the first layer, he starts having hallucinations about his past encounters. The man was an ambitious young painter who used his pianist wife as a model for his painting. Soon his wife became pregnant and she bore a daughter. After she gave birth, he decided to spend more time working on his paintings, leaving his wife to care for their daughter. After buying a dog for his family, he started to have drinking problems due to constant stress and noise outside his workshop. He attached a muzzle to the dog, but was soon plagued by rats, likely a figment of his schizophrenia. The dog may have later been killed by him. His talent started to slowly decay and his vision for the painting became twisted, and he began to drive away his friends by painting gory and horrific works for simple jobs, including a set of illustrations for Little Red Riding Hood. After a long period of neglect, his wife decided to burn his paintings, including his most cherished work, \\"The Lady In Black\\". He had a drunken fit and apparently beat her, driving her to leave with their child. He tried calling her multiple times but failed to reconcile with her. After some time, he got a phone call telling him that she was critically injured in a fire. She ended up horribly disfigured, but their daughter survived. After the fire, he took his wife, now a wheelchair user, and daughter back home so he could take care of them. His drinking problems continued due to the constant \\"distractions\\" of their presence. After regaining her ability to walk, the wife was neglected even more because her husband thought she lacked \\"beauty\\". After he had another drunken outburst, his wife committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathroom. In the present day, it is revealed that he went insane and possibly took six body parts of his wife to work on his painting: her skin as the canvas, her blood as the overlay, her bone marrow as the undercoating, a brush made from her hair, her finger for the smearing and her eye as the spectator. The character is shown using these items, but considering the cyclical nature of one of the endings and the general ambiguous nature of what is shown throughout the story, it's possible that this isn't meant to be taken literally. There are three different endings featured in the game, each depending on the player's actions during the course of the game. The endless loop ending shows that the artist was working on a portrait of his wife as the masterpiece. He seemingly succeeds in creating the painting, and steps back to admire it only to see the figure of his wife devolve into a mutilated figure that proceeds to taunt him. Horrified, he grabs the painting and hurls it into a room full of identical paintings, all of which begin to laugh. It is revealed that the painter spent years shut in his house working on the same picture multiple times trying to perfect it in a cycle of obsessive mental deterioration. If the player enters the room where the artist threw the painting into, it is revealed that all the portraits are well made and resemble the artist's wife, but he can only see them as a disfigured mess. Returning to the studio, he unveils a blank canvas and begins working on the next painting, further continuing his self-destructive cycle as the screen fades to black. The family ending is much the same, but this time he puts his child in the painting too. He then realizes the horrible mistakes he has made, and that he can never bring them back, no matter how many times he tries. He goes to the room upstairs and burns all of his previous paintings along with his finished work before laying down and dying in the fire. The selfish ending ends with a portrait of himself as his final attempt. Being finally satisfied, he decides to hang it in the room upstairs. The next shot goes to his painting on a display at a museum among other famous Victorian artists. = Inheritance = The Inheritance downloadable content add-on tells the story of the painter's daughter coming back to her childhood home to face her past after she left \\"The St. Martin de Porres Home for Problem Children\\". Beginning in the 1960s, exploring the destroyed home with a flashlight, she relives her experiences and witnesses the full scope of the tragedy that has swallowed up the family. During the course of these relived memories, there are different outcomes depending on the daughter's actions. These include deliberate choices, such as heading more often towards the mother or father portrait while exploring, which will lead to remembered dialogue portraying the mother or father, respectively, in a more favorable light. Non-deliberate choices involve the daughter having to perform in-game tasks that often affect an interaction with the father. One example involves the daughter creating artwork, where the daughter could create childish drawings with crayons (earning harsh disapproval from the father), or where the daughter can paint along with the father's suggestions (earning praise if done correctly). These outcomes can lead to the daughter either viewing the father as a harsh man who never wanted anything but a protegee, or viewing the father as a caring man who had trouble showing it. The \\"good\\" ending occurs if most of the memories lead to the daughter viewing the artist favorably. Upon entering her old bedroom, the daughter sees a portrait of her with a flower - her inheritance by her father. She views this portrait as an apology, \\"expressed in the only language [the artist] ever truly knew\\". Seeing the father as a tragic figure, who was driven insane and depressed by the memories of the house, takes the portrait and burns the house down. As the house burns, the daughter leaves accepting she cannot understand the artist, but can forgive him. The portrait is later shown hanging in the daughter's home, while the daughter admires her own child's drawings. However, the scene ends with the daughter criticizing her child's choice in color - mirroring the same statement the artist made years ago - while the portrait distorts, heavily implying that the daughter is now beginning to experience the same mental imbalance and obsession over perfection as her father. The \\"bad\\" ending occurs if most of the memories lead to the daughter viewing the artist negatively. Upon entering her old bedroom, and seeing the portrait of her, the daughter continues having flashbacks of the artist yelling at her for crying and making noise. Still viewing the portrait as an apology, the daughter thinks of the artist's smugness in thinking a painting would resolve her bad childhood. Viewing the portrait as not enough of an apology, in a room filled with bad memories, the daughter smashes it against a dresser. The action inadvertently knocking over a lit candelabra. Fire engulfs the room, leading the ceiling to collapse both trapping and burying the daughter in the burning house. The \\"true\\" ending appears if the daughter collects all nine of her crayon drawings present throughout the house, and is able to rearrange them - with the lights on - to reveal a larger portrait of her. In darkness, a hidden sketch of a large rat reveals a map of the house, showing a marked location the daughter can now find. Realizing her father planted this clue knowing that she would see it, the daughter realizes her true inheritance is seeing the world as her father had. Upon following the map and finding a covered canvas, the daughter remembers being told that \\"insanity runs in my family\\", and decides to \\"let it run\\". This ending closes on the canvas being unveiled to show the same first layer the artist started with for his story, and the decrepit room appearing bright and intact as it had for the artist. Development Layers of Fear was heavily inspired by P.T., a teaser game for the cancelled video game, Silent Hills. The plot, in particular the ending with the blank canvas, closely parallels Anthony M. Rud's short story \\"A Square of Blank Canvas\\" from the April 1924 issue of Weird Tales. The game uses the Unity game engine. Reception Nick Monroe of The Escapist praised the game. \\"A magnum opus (...) A superb example of making story and atmosphere work together (...) Layers of Fear achieves its goal of making you scared as a player, instead of just existing as something scary\\".https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video- games/editorials/reviews/15403-Layers-of-Fear-Review Matt Ferguson from Syfy Games praised the storytelling calling it \\"Perfection\\" and saying the game was, \\"an evocatively thrilling horror game: it strikes a fantastic balance between narrative, gameplay, atmospheric immersion.\\"http://www.nerdappropriate.com/2016/08/16/review-layers-of-fear- inheritance-is-scary-good/ Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku said \\"Layers of Fear is one of the biggest horror surprises of the year.\\"http://kotaku.com/layers- of-fear-is-the-one-of-the-biggest-horror-surpris-1727798873 Danielle Riendeau and Dave Tach of Polygon said \\"Layers of Fear is like P.T. on drugs.\\" Matt Thrower from GameSpot rated the game a 7/10 saying, \\"Stacked up like the rickety tiers of a Gothic building, Layers of Fear proves aptly named.\\" Leon Hurley praised the game in a GamesRadar review, stating \\"it's one of the best horror games I've ever played and literally creates a new tool set for interactive scares.\\" He complimented the game's art and the \\"unease from a horror experience\\" it provides, giving it a maximum score. Choi Rad of IGN found the subject of the game interesting but declared the game not scary lacking tension and having telegraphed scares and that \\"every time I started to enjoy the flow, it was broken by small puzzle challenges that just aren‚Äôt fun to solve.\\" Joe Juba of Game Informer echoed Rad's statements of critiquing the games telegraphed scares, noting that it felt like a haunted house at a carnival rather than P.T., declaring that \\" After a scary moment, it doesn‚Äôt allow players enough breathing room, because the next one is always immediately around the corner. Every time you enter a room or a hallway, something happens.\\"  Sequel  In October 2018, developer Bloober Team announced that a sequel to Layers of Fear, titled Layers of Fear 2 and previously code-named Project M√©li√®s, it was published by Gun Media on May 28, 2019.https://www.pcgamer.com/layers-of-fear-2-revealed-set-to-come-out-next- year/ References External links * Category:2016 video games Category:Aspyr games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Psychological horror games Category:Video games developed in Poland Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games set in the 1920s Category:Video games set in the 1960s Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Works about painting ","title":"Layers of Fear"},{"id":"49440888","text":"Gremuchiy is an urban-type settlement as part of the Krasnogorievsk rural locality in the Boguchansky District of Russia.

Andy Field (born 21 June 1973 in Ilford) is professor of Quantitative Methods at the University of Sussex. Field did his B.Sc. Psychology 1991‚Äì1994 at City University London and his D.Phil. at University of Sussex from 1994‚Äì1997. Field is the author of several textbooks about statistics, which typically deal with software application of statistical theory in SPSS and R. His books are characterised by an irreverent, sometimes outrageous, writing style that is atypical of academic texts. His student- friendly approach to writing led to The Times Higher Education Supplement dubbing him 'the Harry Potter of the social sciences'. Field received different honors from the British Psychological Society: their Teaching Award in 2005 which recognises unusually significant contributions to education and training in psychology within the UK. And in 2007 the Book Award for the second edition of his book Discovering Statistics Using SPSS: and sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll. In 2010 he received a National Teaching Fellowship for individual excellence in teaching. He became fellow of the Higher Education Academy in 2009 and fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in 2010. His current field of research lies in anxiety, child development and maths attainment. In 2016 Field published An Adventure In Statistics: The Reality Enigma, which is described as a textbook embedded within a fictional novel. The book also contains graphic novel elements. The book was a finalist for The Association of Learned & Professional Society Publishers Award for Innovation in Publishing, the British Book Design and Production Awards (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Education category) and the British Psychological Society book award.  Personal life  In his books, Field typically cites the music that he listened to while writing. The bands cited are predominantly in the genres of Rock music, Progressive rock, and Heavy metal music. He lists his musical heroes as Dave Murray of Iron Maiden and Mikael √Ökerfeldt and Martin Axenrot of Opeth. From 1989 until 1996 Field played guitar and sang in the heavy metal band Scanxion and in a 2014 article he discusses playing the drums in a band called Fracture Pattern. His books make frequent references to his pets. He is married with two sons, and lives in Brighton. Books *Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics: and Sex and Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll.

The book provides a detailed account of these two places as they change over time drawing on industrial histories, ethnographic observation, oral history interviews, and fieldwork on both sides of the border.

The station was enlarged in 1894.Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire 1901 Crane Street was on the Newport to Blaenavon line which closed for passengers in 1962 (passenger services on the line to Brynmawr had ended in 1941). Part of the station building was used in the creation of a station on the Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway. The site of the station is now occupied by Tesco's car park in Pontypool.

The Vepsians are a Finnic people of northern Russia whose language belongs to the Uralic languages. Nikolay Abramov Life and career Abramov composed poems and literature in both Vepsian and Russian, which have been translated into more than 20 languages. He was the author of seven collections of poetry, which have been released in Vepsian, Russian, Estonian, French and Hungarian. Abramov first published his poetry in the Finnish-language journal, Punalippu, in February 1989. His book, Koumek√ºmne koume, which was released in 1994, was the first Vepsian-language book of literature ever published. He was accepted into the Writers' Union of Russia in 1998.

It is one of several ghost towns situated within the 125,000 acre acoustic buffer zone of NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center. It stood along the banks of the Pearl River and had been the site of a very large sawmill and logging community. History Formerly known as Cabanage Latanier, meaning \\"palmetto camp\\", much of the early European history is unknown. The earliest person to own land in the area was Jean Baptiste Rousseve. In 1788, Rousseve was granted 1000 arpens in the area and built a house at what would become Logtown. In 1805, Rousseve transferred his claim to Joseph Challon, and the Challon name was associated with the town into the twentieth century. As the timber industry built the town into a major population in the nineteenth century, the town was named Logtown. The town's economy relied on logging and lumber shipping. The first sawmill was built in 1845 by E. G. Goddard of Michigan. In 1889, Henry Weston founded the H. Weston Lumber Company. At the time it was America's largest lumber company, employing 1,200 men, using over 20 barges and four two-masted schooners, and at its peak supporting a community of over 3,000 people. The H. Weston Lumber Company operated in Logtown until 1930. By then, all of the usable and merchantable lumber had been exhausted, and the town population rapidly declined, along with its industrial importance. By 1961, there were about 250 residents. Today Today, the only thing left untouched is the Logtown cemeteries. There are three privately owned family cemeteries with graves dating back as early as the 1850s. Along the Pearl River you can find an artesian well and concrete and brick structures that were once the foundations of some of the buildings. Snaking through the pine and hardwood forest is the Possum Walk Trail, a 3 mile hiking trail stretching in between the Nasa Infinity Science Center and Logtown. Along the trail you can find many signs telling Logtown's history and even see remnants of the historic Dummy Line railroad.

At age 37, he was the youngest state university president in the United States.  Early life and education  Babbidge was born on May 18, 1925 in West Newton, Massachusetts, the son of a merchant sea captain and his wife. His family moved to New Haven when he was 4 years old and then to Amherst, New York, when he was 12. Babbidge graduated high school in Amherst. He became the first member of his family to go to college. He put himself through college by a combination of scholarships and part-time jobs, including bricklaying. Babbidge earned three degrees in history from Yale University. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1945, his master's degree in 1948, and his doctorate in 1953. His doctoral dissertation examined the founding and early years of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. While appreciative of football, Babbidge never played sports. He was blind in his left eye from a childhood accident.  Career  Babbidge taught American studies at Yale and became director of financial aid. He then joined the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, where he served as special assistant to the commissioner of education (1955‚Äì1956), assistant to the secretary of the department (1957‚Äì1958), and finally as assistant U.S. commissioner of education and director of the Division of Higher Education (1959‚Äì1961). Babbidge received the department‚Äôs Distinguished Service Medal in 1961 before he moved to become vice president of the American Council on Education (1961‚Äì1962). The U.S. Junior Chamber named him one of the ‚Äúten outstanding young men of the nation‚Äù because of his work administering the National Defense Education Act. Babbidge and his wife, Marcia Adkisson, invented the political board game Convention, which John F. Kennedy played during his 1960 presidential campaign. = President of the University of Connecticut = Babbidge presided over major growth at UConn. Student enrollment rose from 11,877 in 1962 to 20,514 in 1972, while graduate student enrollment more than doubled from 1720 to 4225 over the same period. The number of doctoral degrees awarded more than tripled. The library grew from 270,000 volumes to 1.15 million, becoming one of only fifty-nine of the nation‚Äôs 2,200 four-year colleges and universities that could claim such resources. In New England, only Harvard, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, and MIT had larger collections by the end of his tenure. Babbidge established new dental and medical schools, and began construction on an $85 million complex that became the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington. Under his leadership, the university opened a campus at Avery Point in Groton, launched more than a dozen academic departments and programs, and established the Honors Program, the UConn Foundation, and the William Benton Museum of Art. Babbidge also raised faculty salaries, thereby making UConn more competitive in attracting talent. The latter half of Babbidge's tenure saw campus roiled by student protests against the Vietnam War, racism, and sexism. Babbidge himself remained generally popular with students and faculty. However, in 1970, Connecticut elected a fiscally conservative governor, Thomas Meskill, whose attitude toward UConn \\"bordered on antagonism,\\" according to historian Bruce M. Stave. Babbidge announced his resignation on October 1, 1971, to be effective one year from that date. The University Senate and more than 7,000 students signed a petition asking him to stay on. After a long and troubled search for Babbidge's successor, during which Provost Edward V. Gant served as acting president, Glenn Ferguson was named president and took office in 1973. = After UConn = Upon his resignation from UConn's presidency in 1972, Babbidge became master of Timothy Dwight College at Yale University, where he remained for four years. He entered the race for the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, dropping out in deference to Ella Grasso.

It is centred on the town of Two Wells with the locality of Port Gawler at the south western corner of its boundary. It is one of the eight hundreds of the County of Gawler. It was named in 1851 by Governor Henry Young either directly or indirectly after the former Governor George Gawler. The following localities and towns of the Adelaide Plains Council area are situated inside (or largely inside) the bounds of the Hundred of Port Gawler: * Port Gawler * Two Wells * Lewiston * Middle Beach * Lower Light (most part) * Korunye (most part) * Reeves Plains (most part) Local government The first local government body established in the area was the District Council of Mudla Wirra, proclaimed in 1854. Mudla Wirra council encompassed those parts of the Hundred of Port Gawler and Hundred of Grace south of the River Light as well as all of the Hundred of Mudla Wirra. In 1856 those parts in the hundreds of Grace and Port Gawler seceded to form the District Council of Port Gawler. North of the River Light it was not until 1873 that local government was formed by the establishment of the District Council of Dublin which encompassed both the Hundred of Dublin and that unincorporated north western part of the Hundred of Port Gawler. In 1935 Port Gawler council amalgamated with Dublin and Grace councils to form the District Council of Mallala (initially called District Council of Light, much later called Adelaide Plains Council). This brought the entire hundred under the local governance of a single council body. 300px See also * Gawler River (South Australia) * Lands administrative divisions of South Australia References Port Gawler Category:1851 establishments in Australia ","title":"Hundred of Port Gawler"},{"id":"49441736","text":"Chaudhary Charan Singh Post Graduate College is a government aided private college adjacent to Saifai, Etawah.

He had a great knowledge of the history of art and he was always interested in the work of his contemporaries.John Russell, \\"Art: Cham Hendon's Worlds Out of Small Beakers\\", New York Times, February 2, 1979. When asked once if he was \\"driven\\" to make paintings, he replied that he didn't think he was driven, he just wasn't happy doing anything else. Hendon moved to Connecticut in 2007 where he continued painting until the end of his life. He was very active in the New Haven art community and he attended the opening of his last one-man show at Fred Giampietro Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut two months before his death. Cham Hendon died of lung cancer at his home in Hamden, Connecticut at the age of 77.

Cham showed an interest in art from an early age and he won several prizes in high school for his art work, but after graduation in 1954The Birmingham News, \\"Birmingham Native Cham Hendon back in city for art exhibit\\", Susan Strickland, January 21, 2003 he decided to follow the lead of his father, and his older brother, Harry, and become an engineer. He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology and graduated in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in Engineering. After fulfilling his military obligation, Hendon attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1963. While attending the Art Institute he met and married Cathryn \\"Kay\\" Campbell. Their first child, Sarah Patricia Hendon, was born in Chicago on April 2, 1962. Hendon and his family then moved to New Mexico, where he attended graduate school at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque. He graduated with a master's degree in Fine Arts in 1965. His second daughter, Jean Campbell Hendon, was born in Albuquerque on July 10, 1963. After graduation, Hendon took a position at the University of Denver, Denver Colorado, where he taught painting, drawing and design. His third child, a son, Luke Chambless Hendon, was born in Denver on January 23, 1967. In 1967, Hendon relocated his family to Madison, Wisconsin where he became the Director of the Madison Art Center, a position he held from 1968 to 1977.Madison Art Center Newsletter, \\"New Acquisitions\\", Madison, Wisconsin, July‚ÄìAugust, 1989 During this time, he continued to paint in a small studio at his home. By 1977 when he left the Madison Art Center, he had separated from his wife, moved into a larger studio space and was devoting his time to exploring a new approach to painting with acrylic paint. He completed a Master of Fine Arts degree that year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his paintings were represented by the Phyllis Kind Gallery in Chicago. During this time, he met Shelley Lynn (O'Meara) Caldwell and in 1978, he moved, with Shelley and her small son, Ian Michael Caldwell,born October 25, 1972 in Madison, Wisconsin, to Shelley Caldwell and Ronald B. Caldwell. to a loft in Tribeca in New York City. He remained with Shelley until his death in 2014. They have one daughter, Wallis Helon Caldwell Hendon, born in New York City on May 16, 1981. New York years, 1978-1999 =Painting= John Russell, art critic for the New York Times, wrote in 1979, \\"When Marcia Tucker got together an exhibition called \\"Bad Painting\\" at the New Museum not long ago, the best bad painter on view was a young man from Wisconsin called Cham Hendon.\\" Hendon's work was marked by \\"a speculative and tenacious intelligence\\", and Russell went on to say that the paintings were good to look at, they had something to say and they were not taken from anyone else. That unique quality of Hendon's paintings defies classification. Some of his work has been called \\"narrative painting\\",Nassau County Museum of Art, \\"American Narrative Painting and Sculpture: The 1980's\\", From the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (exhibition catalog), Roslyn Harbor, New York, 1991. but only a portion of his work fits that definition. His paintings have \\"affinities with Pop Art\\", but not the \\"dead- pan look of Pop Art\\". His method of painting is \\"akin to Jackson Pollock\\" New Vision, Newsletter of the Waterworks Visual Arts Center, \\"Cham Hendon, Paintings\\", Perry Nesbitt, Salisbury, North Carolina, Vol. 2, No. 2, March/April, 1990. and has been described as a \\"slow motion form of action painting\\",Arts, \\"Cham Hendon\\", Judd Tully, April 1979, p. 19. but the result is figurative, not abstract. Hendon's style has been referred to as \\"poured pointillism\\",Flash Art, \\"Cham Hendon\\", Judd Tully, No. 104, October/November, 1981, p. 13. and \\"synthetic impressionist portraits\\".The Waterloo Courier, \\"Cham Hendon Exhibition Is Dynamic, Forlorn\\", Cynthia Greene-Bickley, Waterloo, Iowa, December 7, 1990, p.

D7. There are many variations on the description of how the paintings are done, but most agree that the paintings are created by pouring the paint onto a canvas stretched on a flat surface. The canvas has a drawing on it to guide Hendon's work and the poured paint builds up a thick, multicolored surface that defines the shapes in the drawing.Interview, Gorky's Granddaughter, Zachary Keeting and Chris Joy, February, 2012. The resulting paintings are difficult to put into words.

But knowing how the paint is applied, and reading descriptions of the paintings, does not prepare the viewer for the visual impact of an actual painting.

Zyuohgers Amu, Leo, Yamato Kazakiri, Misao Mondo, Sela, and Tusk. The core five Zyuohgers are composed of four , humanoids with animal features from a pocket dimension called , and one human who fight together to defend Earth from the Dethgaliens. Each Zyuohger carries a , a cuboid-like device which they use to transform, control their mecha, disguise the Zyuman members of the team as normal humans and use as a cellphone, and a , a sidearm that has both a for the finisher and a for the finisher. They also possess a special mode known as that associates each of them with the animal they represent, manifesting certain features from said animal once this ability has been activated. The Zyuohgers later gain another human member that was originally captured and brainwashed to fight for the Dethgaliens, but joins their side after he breaks free from the villains' control with their help. Following the destruction of Ginis and the Dethgaliens, their owners learning that Zyuland was part of Earth, the Zyuohgers' Champion's Proofs merge their realities back into one with humanity and Zyumans entering a coexistence. =Yamato Kazakiri= is a young zoologist with empathy for humans and animals alike who transforms into the red-colored . He also leads the Zyuohgers. During his childhood, Yamato got lost in a forest during a stormy night after running away from his home due to his resentment for his father and was rescued by a mysterious eagle Zyuman who presented him with a cube known as the , which he kept as a good luck charm. Years later, Yamato discovers a massive structure known as the which serves as the gateway between Earth and Zyuland, and uses the Champion's Proof to travel to the other side, where he meets the other Zyuohgers for the first time. Once back on Earth, the Champion's Proofs in his and the other Zyuohgers' possession transform into the Zyuoh Changers to help them fend off the Dethgalien's first attack, but with the Link Cube destroyed and the sixth Champion's Proof gone missing, the other Zyuohgers end up stranded on Earth and Yamato decides to shelter them. On several occasions, Yamato met the Zyuman that rescued him in the past named Bud who was responsible for severing the Link Cube after the Zyuland officials were discovered trying to dispose human trespassers into their dimension. He greatly resented his father due to the latter's inability to arrive at his mother's final hours before her death, but soon learned his reason for saving Bud in the past. Yamato later discovers that his vision has increased to superhuman levels after he became a Zyuohger, allowing him to see far distances and dodge enemy attacks much faster. With the help of the gorilla Zyuman Larry, Yamato gains the ability to transform into . With help from the Gokaigers, the Zyuohgers gain the which allows Yamato to transform into . *As the Zyuoh Eagle, Yamato's Wild Release grants him a pair of eagle wings on his arms which allow him to fly and strike enemies from above at high speed.

By combining his energy with the other Zyuohgers, Zyuoh Gorilla can perform the finisher. *As the Zyuoh Whale, Yamato wields the Whale Change Gun as his main weapon. His finishers are the , which can get even stronger by combining his energy with the other Zyuohgers, and the , which can freeze the target in place instead of destroying them. During the final battle against Ginis, Yamato is empowered by the Earth's energy which allows him to activate a Great Wild Release in a similar fashion to Zyuoh The World where he combines the powers and features of his three Zyuohger forms into one. This enables him to fly and wield the Eagriser like Zyuoh Eagle, be strong and muscular like Zyuoh Gorilla, and wield the Whale Change Gun like Zyuoh Whale. During the battle against Pocane Daniro, Yamato fuses with Bud into an indigo-colored version of Zyuoh Eagle called , also known as the , via the Cube Condor's power This enables him to fly and wield both Zyuohgers' Eagrisers.

After the Dethgalien's defeat, she reunites with her brother and parents. Later, she works at a children's home for both humans and Zyumans. As the Zyuoh Shark, Sela's Wild Release grants her a shark dorsal fin on her back which allows her to swim in all kinds of surfaces as if they were made of water as well as launch herself into a spinning attack with the fin acting as a sawblade.

On the one hand, great female Celts are known from mythology and history; on the other hand, their real status in the male- dominated Celtic tribal society was socially and legally constrained. Yet Celtic women were somewhat better placed in inheritance and marriage law than their Greek and Roman contemporaries. Our knowledge of the situation of Celtic women on the European mainland is almost entirely obtained from contemporary Greek and Roman authors, who saw the Celts as barbarians and wrote about them accordingly. Information about Celtic women of the British Isles comes from ancient travel and war narratives, and possibly the orally transmitted myths later reflected in Celtic literature of the Christian era. Written accounts and collections of these myths are only known from the early Middle Ages. Archaeology has revealed something of the Celtic woman through artefacts (particularly grave goods), which can provide clues about their position in society and material culture. Reliefs and sculptures of Celtic women are mainly known from the Gallo-Roman culture. A consistent matriarchy, which was attributed to Celtic women by Romantic authors of the 18th and 19th centuries and by 20th century feminist authors, is not attested in reliable sources.  Duration and extent of Celtic culture  thumb300pxExtent of Celtic people and language: The Celts (Ancient Greek ŒöŒ≠ŒªœÑŒøŒπ Keltoi; Latin Celtae, Galli, Galati) were tribes and tribal confederations of ancient Europe, who resided in west central Europe in the Late Bronze Age and early Iron Age (the Hallstatt culture). In the La T√®ne period they expanded, through migration and cultural transmission, to the British Isles, northern Iberia, the Balkan peninsula and Asia Minor. The Greeks and Romans commonly referred to areas under Celtic rule as ŒöŒµŒªœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ or Celticum.Livy, Ab urbe condita 5.34 They had a relatively uniform material culture (especially in the La T√®ne period) and non-material culture (customs and norms), which differed from neighbouring peoples like the Italians, Etruscans, Illyrians, Greeks, Iberians, Germans, Thracians and Scythians.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 32 ff. The Celtic mainland was characterised by this culture from 800 BC at the earliest until about the fifth century AD (End of the Roman rule in the Celtic sphere and Christianisation of Ireland). Claims made by some Celtic scholars, that traces of Celtic culture are already visible in the second millennium BC, are controversial. In Post-Roman Britain, Celtic culture and rule continued, until pushed to the margins of the island after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons. In Ireland, Celtic culture remained dominant for even longer. Linguistically, the Celts were united as speakers of Celtic languages, which were and are Indo-European languages related most closely to German and Latin, with clear common features.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. pp. 187, 295 f.  Women in Celtic society  References to Celtic women are not only rare but are also excluding medieval source material from the inhabitants of Brittany, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, derived from the writings of the Celts' Greek and Roman neighbours. In addition, the overwhelming majority of these sources come from the first century BC and the first century AD. The main problem, however, is the fact that the term \\"Celtic\\" spans such an enormous area, from Ireland to Anatolia; there is no reason to expect that the position of women was the same over this whole area. Source material must, therefore, be clarified by archaeological evidence, which, however, can only answer certain kinds of questions. = Evidence =  Archaeology  The Vix Krater, an imported Greek wine- mixing vessel found in the famous grave of the \\"Lady of Vix\\" Archaeological finds are almost entirely burials; in the Hallstatt culture area, which is the dispersion area of this cultural material, especially at D√ºrrnberg near Hallein, this material can already be identified as Celtic in the Late Hallstatt phase (sixth century BC). The grave goods of female inhumations indicate cultural exchange with southern Europe, especially the North Italian Este and Villanovan cultures.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 43, 307 f. Female burials are associated with specific grave goods, such as combs, mirrors, toiletries (nail cutters, tweezers, ear spoonsHelmut Birkhan: Kelten. Bilder ihrer Kultur. pp. 351, image 658.), spinning whorls (flywheel of a pindle, a tool for making yarn,Since the wooden body of the spindle does not survive, it is the clay whorl which is most commonly found in graves; stone weights from wooden looms are also common) pottery vessels, necklaces, earrings, hairpins, cloak pins, finger rings, bracelets and other jewellery. A large majority of graves have no gender-specific grave goods, but where such goods are found, they almost always belong to female graves.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 78, 149, 387, 633, 1849 f. The Vix Grave from modern France is the most famous rich female burial, but there are several other significant ones. In the Vix Grave a huge bronze krater or mixing bowl was found which indicates the high status of the woman buried there. It derives from a Greek workshop and is 1.6 m high, weighs over 200 kg and has a volume of 1100 litres, making it the largest metal vessel to survive from the ancient world.Arnulf Krause: Die Welt der Kelten, pp. 131 f. In eight cremation graves from Frankfurt Rhine-Main from the middle and late La T√®ne period, which contained young girls, statues of dogs were found, measuring 2.1 to 6.7 cm in length. They were made of jet, clay, glass and bronze; their purpose, whether amulet, votive gift or toy, cannot be determined.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, p. 810. There is evidence that in the earlier Celtic periods rich torcs of precious metal were mainly worn by females; later this changed. Another example of a richly furnished female grave is a grave chamber of the necropolis of G√∂blingen-Nospelt (Luxembourg), containing an amphora of fish sauce (garum fish sauce from Gades was a widely popular food seasoning), a bronze saucepan with strainer lid, a bronze cauldron, two bronze basins with a bronze bucket, a Terra sigillata plate, several clay cups and jugs, a mirror and eight fibulae.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, p. 650\\\\. The reconstructed grave chamber is depicted in Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Bilder ihrer Kultur. p. 323, image 567. Archaeological finds in the 19th century were often interpreted in light of contemporary ideas about gender without consideration of differences between modern and ancient cultures. Gender roles were assumed to be unalterable and, accordingly, grave goods were identified as \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" without ambiguity. Only when it became possible to determine the sex of human remains through osteological analysis was this approach revealed as overly simplistic.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 632 f.  Literary sources  Written evidence is first transmitted by the Greeks: the historian and geographer Hecataeus of Miletus (Periegesis), the seafarer and explorer Pytheas of Massilia (On the Ocean) (both of these works survive only in fragments), the geographer and ethnologist Herodotus (Histories) and the polymath Poseidonius (On the Ocean and its Problems). Nothing of Poseidonius' work survives directly; it is only transmitted as citations in other authors, such as Julius Caesar's (Commentarii de Bello Gallico). Other Greek writers include Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheke), who used older sources, Plutarch (Moralia), who took a position on the role of women, and Strabo (Geography), who expanded on the work of Polybius (Histories) through personal travels and research. Among the works of Roman historians are the universal history of Pompeius Trogus (Philippic History) which only survives in the epitome of Marcus Iunianus Iustinus. As a Gaul himself (he belonged to the Vocontii tribe), Trogus would have transmitted much of his information at first hand. Tacitus (Annals) described Britannia and its conquest by the Romans; Ammianus Marcellinus (Res Gestae) had served as a soldier in Gaul; Livy (Ab Urbe Condita) reported on Celtic culture; Suetonius (Lives of the Caesars) was also a Roman official and describes Caesar's Gallic Wars; and the senator and consul Cassius Dio (Roman History) recounted the campaign against the Celtic queen Boudicca. Julius Caesar had portrayed an image of the Celts in his Bellum Gallicum, tailored above all to his own domestic political purposes.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. p. 181. Among later historians, there is also Gerald of Wales who was born to a Cambro-Norman family in the 12th century and composed an important account of the history and geography of the British Isles. = Social position = Princess Tomb of Reinheim  Women as secular and religious leaders  The social position of women differed by region and time period.

Thus modern authors refer to them as both \\"Ladies\\" and \\"Princesses\\".Alexander Demandt: Die Kelten, p. 50; Bernhard Maier: Geschichte und Kultur der Kelten. p. 142. The chariot found in the grave of an elite female person in Mitterkirchen im Machland is accompanied by valuable goods like those listed above.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten.

CaesarCaesar: De bello Gallico 6,19: ‚Ä¶ vitae necisque potestatem. stresses the \\"power of life and death\\" held by husbands over their wife and children. Strabo Strabo Ge√¥graphik√° III 3, 7 mentions a Celtic tribe, in which the \\"Men and women dance together, holding each other's hands\\", which was unusual among Mediterranean peoples. He states that the position of the sexes relative to each other is \\"opposite... to how it is with us.\\"Strabo Ge√¥graphik√° IV 4, 3 Ammianus Marcellinus,Ammianus Marcellinus Res gestae XV 12, 1 in his description of the manners and customs of the Gauls, describes the furor heroicusThe name is modern, modelled on the furor Teutonicus of Lucan Bellum Civile 1.255 (heroic fury) of the Gallic women, as \\"large as men, with flashing eyes and teeth bared.\\"Helmut Birkhan. Nachantike Keltenrezeption. pp. 598 f. To understand this statement properly, it is necessary to know that Romans at this time had an average height of 1.5 metres, while Celtic women in the time of Caesar were sometimes 1.55 m tall. They were, therefore, from the point of view of ancient historians, actually as large as (Roman) men. Recent research has cast doubt on the significance of these ancient authors' statements.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. pp. 132 f. The position of Celtic women may have changed, especially under the influence of Roman culture and law, which saw the man as head of his household.Frank Siegmund in the SWR-Interview from the series Die Kelten: Die Frauen, das Essen und der Luxus der Kelten, online British female rulers, like Boudicca and Cartimandua, were seen as exceptional phenomena; the position of king (Proto-Celtic *rig-s) - in Gaul mostly replaced by two elected tribal leaders even before Caesar's time - was usually a male office.Wolfgang Meid: Die Kelten. pp. 96 f. Female rulers did not always receive general approval. Thus, according to Tacitus, the Brigantes \\"goaded on by the shame of being yoked under a woman\\"Tacitus, Annales 12,40. revolted against Cartimandua; her marital disagreement with her husband Venutius and the support she received from the Romans likely played an important role in her maintenance of power. On the other hand, he says of Boudicca, before her decisive defeat, \\"[The Britons] make no distinction of gender in their leaders.\\"Tacitus Agricola 16 Whether a Celtic princess Onomaris (·ΩàŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÅŒπŒæ), mentioned in the anonymous Tractatus de Mulieribus Claris in bello (\\"Account of women distinguished in war\\"), was real, is uncertain. She is meant to have taken leadership when no men could be found due to a famine and to have led her tribe from the old homeland over the Danube and into southeastern Europe.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 337, 1024; John T. Koch: Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Band 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, , p. 1396; David Rankin: Celts and the Classic World, pp. 248 f. In later times, female cultic functionaries are known, like Celtic/Germanic seeress VeledaHer name derives from the Celtic banfili; (Proto-Celtic *·π∑elƒ´-s, cf. fili, Welsh gweled, \\"to see\\"; Latin vultus, \\"visage\\"): Helmut Birkhan: Nachantike Keltenrezeption. pp. 487 f. who has been interpreted by some Celtologists as a druidess.Johannes Hoops: Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde.

Celtic es, who prophesied to the Roman emperors Alexander Severus, Aurelian und Diocletian, enjoyed a high repute among the Romans.Bernhard Maier: Die Religion der Kelten. G√∂tter, Mythen, Weltbild. p. 158 f. On the lead Curse tablet from Larzac (c. 100 AD), which with over 1000 letters is the longest known text in the Gaulish language, communities of female magic users are named, containing \\"mothers\\" (matƒ´r) and \\"daughters\\" (duxtƒ´r), perhaps teachers and initiates respectively.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 530 f.  Female slaves  Slave women were mostly war booty, female property given up by insolvent debtors,Arnulf Krause: Die Welt der Kelten, p. 70. or foreign captives and could be employed within the household or sold for profit. As slaves, women had an important economic role on account of their craft work, such that in Ireland, the word cumal (\\"slave woman\\", Old Welsh: aghell and caethverched) was also the term for a common measure of wealth ( a cumal, worth ten s√©t [\\"cows\\"]).Wolfgang Meid: Die Kelten. p. 107; Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 989 f. According to Caesar, favorite slaves were thrown on their masters' funeral pyres and burnt along with their corpses.Caesar De bello Gallico 6.19; Arnulf Krause: Die Welt der Kelten, pp. 171 f.  Childrearing  That caring for children was the role of the women is stated by ancient authors. In addition, in families of higher social standing, there was an institution of foster parentage (Old Irish: aite [foster father] and muimme [foster mother], similar to the Gothic atta [dear father], German Mama and English mummy), in which children of household were given away. The cost which the birth parents had to pay to the foster parents was higher for girls than for boys, because their care was considered more expensive. But there was also a form of foster parentage in which no fee was charged, designed to tighten the links between two families.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. pp. 342 f.  Matriarchy  = Ancient evidence = The mythic rulers of British Celtic legends and the historical queens Boudicca, Cartimandua and (perhaps) Onomarix can be seen only as individual examples in unusual situations, not as evidence of a matriarchy among the Celts. The transmitted texts of pre-Christian sagas and ancient authors speak strongly against its existence. = Modern speculation = The idea of a Celtic matriarchy first developed in the 18th and 19th centuries in connection with the romantic idea of the \\"Noble Savage\\". According to 19th century Unilineal evolutionism, societies developed from a general promiscuity (sexual interactions with changing partners or with multiple simultaneous partners) to matriarchy and then to patriarchy.Helmut Birkhan: Nachantike Keltenrezeption. pp. 1022 f. Heinrich Zimmer's Das Mutterrecht bei den Pikten und Skoten (The Matriarchy of the Picts and Scots) of 1894 argued for the existence of a matriarchy in Northern Ireland and Scotland.Helmut Birkhan: Nachantike Keltenrezeption. pp. 592 f. The evidence was British Celtic sagas about great queens and warrior maidens. The contents of these sagas were falsely presented related to the reality of the relationship between the sexes. In 1938 in his work Die Stellung der Frau bei den Kelten und das Problem des keltischen Mutterrechts (The Position of the Woman among the Celts and the problem of the Celtic Matriarchy), Josef Weisweiler pointed out the misinterpretation: The feminist author Heide G√∂ttner-Abendroth assumes a Celtic matriarchy in Die G√∂ttin und ihr Heros (1980), but its existence remains unsubstantiated. Marion Zimmer Bradley depicted a matriarchal reinterpretation of the stories of King Arthur, Lancelot and the Holy Grail in The Mists of Avalon (1987), which were dominated by the female characters. She employed the contrast between the Celtic matriarchal culture and the Christian patriarchy as a theme of her work. Ingeborg Clarus attempted in her book Keltische Mythen (1991) to reduce the Celtic sagas of Britain to a battle between the sexes, as part of her theory about the replacement of a matriarchy by a patriarchy. She thus continues the evolutionary theories of the 19th century. She calls matriarchy the \\"Pre-Celtic heritage of Ireland\\", and she claims that the transition to patriarchy took place in the 1st century AD in the time of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster .Ingeborg Clarus: Keltische Mythen. Der Mensch und seine Anderswelt. pp. 61, 109, 118 f.  Matrilineality  Matrilineality (the transmission of property through the female line) is not attested for the Celts either. In a matrilineal society, children are related only to the family of the mother not to the family of the father. A situation like that among the Picts, where, according to some accounts, kingship was inherited through the maternal line, but not inherited by the women themselves,David Rankin: Celts and the Classic World. pp. 248 f. The Irish clan (fine, compare with the Old High German word wini, \\"friend\\"Wolfgang Meid: Die Kelten. pp. 105.) was patrilineal and the relatives of the mother had only a few rights and duties relating to the children.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. p. 227. Thus they received only a seventh of the weregild if a child was killed and the male relatives had a duty to seek vengeance for the deed.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 1032 f. Describing the Celtic expansion into southern and southeastern Europe around 600 BC, Livy claims that the two war leaders Bellovesus and Segovesus elected by the army were the sons of the sister of Ambicatus, king of the Bituriges. Here perhaps matrilineality could be a reason for the selection of these leaders, rather than the king's own sons, but other reasons cannot be ruled out, even if the story is not fictional.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 91 f. Among the Iberian, Gallaeci, women had an important role in the family and the clan, despite the importance of men as warriors, indicated by frequent matrilineal succession among them.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 588 f. = Legal position = Nearly all of the following legal matters seem to have been similar, with some regional variation, both on the mainland and in the British Isles.  General legal position  General legal equality ‚Äì not just equality between men and women ‚Äì was unusual among the Celts; it was only a possibility within social classes, which were themselves gender-defined. Celtic women were originally not allowed to serve as legal witnesses and could not conclude contracts with the assistance of a man. In the law and proverb collections Cr√≠th Gablach (\\"The split cow\\") and Bretha Cr√≥lige (\\"Decisions concerning blood guilt\\"), the wergeld was specified exactly for men and women of different social classes and the compensation for women (or their heirs in the event of their death) was significantly smaller, often half the cost for a man of the same class.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 989 f.  Marriage law  In British Celtic law, women had in many respects (for instance marriage law) a better position than Greek and Roman women. According to Irish and Welsh law, attested from the Early Middle Ages, a woman was always under the authority of a man, first her father, then her husband, and, if she was widowed, her son. She could not normally give away or pass on her property without their agreement. Her marriage was arranged by her male relatives, divorce and polygyny (the marriage of one man to several women) were controlled by specific rules. Polyandry (the marriage of one woman to several men) was unusual, although some Celtologists conclude that it sometimes occurred from the Irish saga Longas mac nUislenn (The Exile of the Sons of Uislius). Caesar provides an example of the subordinate position of women: according to him, men had the power of life and death over their wives, as they did over their children, in a similar manner to the Roman pater familias. If the head of a high ranking family died, his relatives would gather and interrogate the wives as well as the slaves, when the death seemed suspicious. Should they consider their suspicions to be correct, they would burn the wives, after torturing them in every possible way. However, he also describes the financial role of the wives as remarkably self-sufficient.Arnulf Krause: Die Welt der Kelten, pp. 131 f.; David Rankin: Celts and the Classic World, p. 131. Caesar also says that among the Britons, up to a dozen men (father, sons and brothers) could jointly possess their women.Caesar De bello Gallico 5, 14 The resulting children would be assigned to whichever man was willing to marry the woman. Today this is seen as a common cliche of ancient barbarian ethnography and political propaganda intended by Caesar to provide a moral justification for his campaigns.Bernhard Maier: Geschichte und Kultur der Kelten. p. 228; David Rankin: Celts and the Classic World, pp. 248 f. In general, monogamy was common. Having several legal wives was limited to the higher social classes.Alexander Demandt: Die Kelten, p. 49. Since marriage was seen as a normal agreement between two people (Cain Lanamna, \\"Agreement of two\\"), it could be dissolved by both partners. A \\"temporary marriage\\" was also common. The position of the wife (Irish: c√©t-muinter, \\"First of the household\\", or pr√≠m-ben, \\"Chief woman\\") was determined by the size of the dowry she brought with her. There were three kinds of marriage: that in which the woman brought more than the man, that in which both brought about equal amounts and finally that in which the woman brought less. If the husband wished to carry out a clearly unwise transaction, the wife possessed a sort of veto power. In a divorce, the wife usually had full control over her dowry. The concubine (Irish: adaltrach, cf. Latin adultera adultress) had much less power and was subordinate to the main wife. She had a legal duty (L√≥g n-enech) to assist the first wife in case of illness and could be harassed and injured by her with impunity for the first three days after her marriage, with only very restricted rights of self-defence (pulling hair, scratching and punching back). After these three days, the ordinary punishments would apply to both in the event of injury or murder.Wolfgang Meid: Die Kelten. pp. 111 f.; Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 1562 f. Adultery by the wife, unlike adultery by the husband, could not be atoned for with a fine. A divorce in the case of adultery could only occur with the agreement of both parties and the wife was not permitted to seek one so long as her husband maintained intimate relations with her. If she was pregnant with her husband's child, she could not have intercourse with other men before the birth of the child, even if thrown out by him. These rules were binding for Celtic noblewomen, but they may have been less strictly binding on the lower classes. In Wales, the wife was allowed to leave her husband if he committed adultery three times, if he was impotent, and if he had bad halitosis taking with her the property which she had brought into the marriage or acquired during it. A rape had to be atoned for by the culprit by handing over the sort of gifts customarily given at a wedding and paying a fine since it was considered a form of \\"temporary\\" marital tie.  Inheritance law  The inheritance law of the British Celts disadvantaged women, especially daughters, in similar ways to marriage law. Only if the inheritance came from the mother or if the daughters originated from the last marriage of a man and the sons from an earlier marriage, were the two genders treated the same. After that, the inheritance returned to her paternal relatives (Fine). This institution of the \\"inheriting-daughter\\" has a parallel in ancient Indian law, in which a father without sons could designate his daughter as a putrikƒÅ (son- like daughter). In Gallic law, widows (old Irish: fedb, Welsh: gweddwn, Cornish gwedeu, Breton: inta√±vez) inherited the entire property left behind by their husband. They could dispose of this property freely, unlike in Old Irish law, in which the widow was under the control of her sons. Only a right to make gifts and a restricted power of sale were granted to her, which was called the bantrebthach (\\"Female householder\\"). The right to make gifts was restricted to transfers within the family.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 2014. Welsh women only received the right to inherit under king Henry II of England (1133‚Äì1189).  C√°in Adomn√°in  The abbot and saint Adomnan of Iona produced the legal work C√°in Adomn√°in (The Canon of Adomnan) or Lex Innocentium (The law of the innocents) on the property of women (especially mothers) and children. He describes the condition of women up till that point, with self-aware exaggeration, as cumalacht (enslavement), in order to highlight the importance of his own work. Adomnan reports that a woman who: According to legend, an experience of Adomnan and his mother had been the impetus for this legal text. The view of a slain Celtic woman and her child - \\"mother's blood and milk streaming over\\" - on the battlefield, shocked his mother so much that she forced her son, by fasting, to compose this law book and to present it to the princes.David Rankin: Celts and the Classic World, pp. 254 ff. (for the whole passage, C√°in Adomn√°in) = Sexuality = In the Trencheng Breth F√©ne (The Triad of Irish Verdicts, a collection of writings dating from the 14th to the 18th centuries) the three female virtues were listed as virginity before marriage, willingness to suffer, and industriousness in caring for her husband and children.Lisa Bitel: Land of Women: Tales of Sex and Gender from Early Ireland. p. 23. The ancient authors regularly describe Celtic women as large, crafty, brave and beautiful. Diodorus and Suetonius, in particular, describe the sexual permissiveness of Celtic women. According to Suetonius, Caesar spent a lot of money on sexual experiences in Gaul. His legionnaires sang in the triumph that he had seduced a horde of Gallic women, calling him a \\"bald whoremonger\\".Suetonius, Divus Iulius 51. Celtic women were described as fertile, prolific and good breastfeeders. These are all clich√©s of the Greeks and Romans about barbarian peoples.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 23 f. Gerald of Wales describes how the Irish are \\"the most jealous people in the world\\", while the Welsh lacked this jealousy and among them guest-friendship-prostitution was common.Gerald of Wales, Descriptio Cambriae 1.10.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. p. 983. In the Irish saga of Conchobar mac Nessa, the king is said to have the right to the first night with any marriageable woman and the right to sleep with the wife of anyone who hosted him. This is called the Geis of the king.Rudolf Thurneysen: Die irischen Helden- und K√∂nigssage bis zum 17. Jahrhundert. Halle 1921, p. 394, 525. Whether this right actually existed and was exercised by the Celts is not attested outside the sagas.Helmut Birkhan. Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. p. 1091. In the saga Immram Curaig Ma√≠le D√∫in (The Sea Voyage of Ma√≠le D√∫in), the conception of the main character occurs when a random traveller sleeps with a nun of a cloister. She says before this \\"our act is not beneficial if this is finally the time when I conceive!\\" The suggestion that Irish women used this knowledge for birth control, sometimes drawn from this is questionable. Large numbers of children are mentioned among the Celts by the ancient authors.In Strabo Geography 4.4.3, Livy Ab urbe condita libri 38.16.13, Justin Philippic History 25.2.8)Wolfgang Meid: Die Kelten. p. 117. The statement of Gerald of Wales that incest had a pervasive presence in the British Isles is false according to modern scholars, since he complains only that a man can marry his cousins in the fifth, fourth and third degrees.Gerald of Wales, Descriptio Cambriae 2.6Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. p. 872. Incest played a key role in British Celtic myth, such as in Tochmarc √âta√≠ne (\\"The Courting of √âta√≠n\\") as in other ancient cultures (like Ancient Egypt or the pair of Zeus and Hera in classical Greece. In actual social life, however, a notable meaning cannot be found.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. p. 180. = Health = Palaeopathological research based on bone samples and, in the best-case scenario, on mummified corpses indicates illnesses found among the ancient Celts. Diseases like sinusitis, meningitis and dental caries leave typical traces. Growth disorders and vitamin deficiencies can be detected from the long bones. Coproliths (fossilised fecal matter) indicate severe worm infections. In total, the data indicates a society which, as a result of poor hygiene and diet, suffered from weak immune systems and a high rate of illness. This is even more marked in women than in men. This is pretty normal for people of this time and area. Among Celtic women degenerative damage to the joints and spinal column were particularly notable on account of the amount of heavy lifting they did. Trauma from violence was more common among men. Differences as a result of social position are not visible. The \\"Lady of Vix\\" was a young Celtic woman of exceptionally high standing, who suffered from pituitary adenoma and otitis media.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 967 f., 1438 f. Skeletal finds in graves provide the following age statistics for the ancient Celts: the average age at death was 35 years old; 38 for men and 31 for women.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 339. = Appearance of Celtic women = Gurk, Carinthia)  Clothing  On account of the poor survival rate of materials (cloth, leather) used for clothing, there is only a little archaeological evidence; contemporary images are rare. The descriptions of ancient authors are rather generalistic; only Diodorus transmits something more detailed.Diodorus Siculus: Bibliotheca historica V 30. According to his report, normal clothing of Celtic men and women was made from very colourful cloth, often with a gold-embroidered outer layer and held together with golden fibulae.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. p. 194. The women's tunic was longer than the men's; a leather or metal belt (sometimes a chain) was tied around the waist. The regional variation in fashion (as well as differences based on age and class) were more complex than the simple tunic. The boldly patterned dresses seen on vases from Sopron in Pannonia were cut like a kind of knee-length maternity dress from stiff material with bells and fringes attached. Tight- waisted skirts with bells in the shape of a crinoline are also depicted. An overdress with a V-shaped cut which was fixed at the shoulders with fibulae was found in Noricum.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 163, 1076 ff. The chain around the waist had hooks for length adjustments, the leftover chain was hung on a chain-link in a loop. The links of this chain-belt could be round, figure-8 shaped, with cross-shaped or flat intermediate links, doubled, tripled, or more with enamel inlays (see Blood enamel). The so-called Norican-Pannonian belt of Roman times was decorated with open-worked fittings. A pouch was often hung from the belt on the right side.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 702, 927. In the British Isles during the Iron Age, ring-headed pins were often used in place of fibulae on dresses and for fixing hairdos in place. This is demonstrated by the different positions the needles are found in burials.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, p. 1593. On a first century AD Celtic gravestone from , a girl is depicted in Norican clothing. It consists of a straight under-dress (Peplos) which reaches to the ankles, a baggy overdress reaching to the knees, which is fastened at the shoulders with large fibulae. A belt with two ribbons hanging down at the front holds the dress in place. In her right hand she holds a basket, in her left hand she holds a mirror up before her face. On her feet there are pointed shoes. Her hair is mostly straight, but coiffed at the back.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, p. 930, pl. H. In everyday life, Celtic women wore wooden or leather sandals with small straps (Latin: gallica, \\"Gallic shoe\\"). Bound shoes made from a single piece of tanned leather tied together around the ankle are often only detectable in graves from the metal eyelets and fasteners which survive around the feet.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, p. 1147. Three mannequins with reconstructed Helvetic/Celtic women's outfits were displayed in the exhibition ‚ÄûGold der Helvetier - Keltische Kostbarkeiten aus der Schweiz‚Äú (Gold of the Helvetii: Celtic Treasures from Switzerland) at the Landesmuseum Z√ºrich in 1991.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Bilder ihrer Kultur. p. 355, Images 667, 668. Grave goods, amber and gold ()  Jewelry  Gold jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, rings) were worn as symbols of social class and were often of high craftsmanship and artistic quality. Girls of the Hallstatt and early La T√®ne culture wore amber chains and amulets as individual chains or multiple string colliers; the colliers had up to nine strings and over a hundred amber beads.Sylvia und Paul F. Botheroyd: Lexikon der keltischen Mythologie. pp. 40 f., 144 f. Amulets were both decoration and apotropaic charms. They were probably added to the tombs of women who were killed violently, to protect the living.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 57 f., 71. Torcs (neck rings) are found in graves of important men and women up to about 350 BC, after that they are usually restricted to male graves.Ingeborg Clarus: Keltische Mythen. Der Mensch und seine Anderswelt. pp. 20 f. The \\"Lady\\" from the tomb at Vix had a torc, placed on her lap, as a grave good; the woman in the tomb at Reinheim wore one around her neck. Boudicca, Queen of the Iceni in Britain around 60 BC is described as wearing a torc, which might reflect her exceptional circumstances as a war leader or be an embellishment of the Roman chronicler.Sylvia und Paul F. Botheroyd: Lexikon der keltischen Mythologie. p. 331. The Hallstatt-period limestone statue of a Celtic woman found at the entrance to the tomb of the \\"Lady of Vix\\" wears a torc and sits on a throne.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 1955 f. Bust of a Norican woman with a Modius cap, W√∂lfnitz-Lendorf, Carinthia)  Head coverings and hairstyles  Since almost no depictions of women survive from the La T√®ne period, archaeologists must make do with Roman provincial images. In these, women are seldom depicted bare-headed, so that more is known about headcoverings than about hairstyles. Celtic women of this time wore winged caps, felt caps in the shape of upturned cones with veils, cylinder-shaped fur caps, bronze tiaras or circlets. The modius cap was a stiff cap shaped like an inverted cone which was especially common in the first century AD around Virunum. It was worn with a veil and rich decoration and indicated women of the upper class. The veil worn over the cap was often so long that it could cover the entire body. In north Pannonia at the same time, women wore a fur cap, with a spiked brim, a veil cap similar to the Norican one and in later times a turban-like head covering with a veil.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 715 f., 950 f. Among the Celtiberian women a structure, which consisted of a choker with rods extending up over the head and a veil stretched over the top for shade, was fashionable.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. p. 163. The hair was often shaved above the oiled forehead. In the Hallstatt period, hairnets have been found; in some accounts, individual emphasised braids (up to three) are mentioned, but most women tied their hair back in a braid. The hair was often coloured red or blonde.Helmut Birkhan: Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. pp. 163, 1067 f. The seer Fedelm in Irish sagas is described with three braids, two tied around her head and one hanging from the back of her head down to her calves. Unlike married women, unmarried women usually wore the hair untied and without a headcovering.Bernhard Maier: Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur. p. 228. Hair needles for fixing caps and hairdos in place are common grave finds from the late Hallstatt period. They have ring-shaped heads which could be richly decorated in some regions. From the La T√®ne period, such needles are only rarely found.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie. A‚ÄìK und L‚ÄìZ, pp. 1343 f., 71.  Women in Celtic mythology  Matrona (National Archaeology Museum, England) In the mainland Celtic area, a great number of goddesses are known; on account of the lack of political unity of the Celts, they seem to have been regional deities. Unlike the Greeks and Romans, the Celts never had a single pantheon, although the Romans attempted to connect them up on the basis of their functions, through the Interpretatio Romana. The mother goddesses which had great importance in Celtic religion were also united in this way under the names Matres and Matronae. In the mythology of the British Celts almost no goddesses are present. The female figures named in the local Irish sagas mostly derive from female figures of the historically unattested migrations period, which are recounted in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (Book of the Taking of Ireland). They were originally described as mythic people, transformed into deities and later into demons after their respective expulsions by the following wave of invaders - mostly these resided in the Celtic Otherworld. An enumeration of the most important female figures of history (not exclusively Irish) is found in the account of the poet Gilla Mo-Dutu √ì Caiside which is known as the Bansenchas (contains 1147 entries). A similar development occurred in Britain, especially in Wales. Very often these mythic female figures embody sovereignty over the land or the land itself (see hieros gamos).Sylvia und Paul F. Botheroyd: Lexikon der keltischen Mythologie. p. 257. Examples from Ireland include Macha and Medb, from Wales, Rhiannon. The dispute between Medb and her husband Ailill mac M√°ta over the wealth brought into the marriage by each of them is the indirect trigger for the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley). All kinds of legal issues in marriage are described in the Celtic myths: The marriage of a sister by her brother (Branwen ferch Ll≈∑r, \\"Branwen, daughter of Ll≈∑r\\"), the marriage of a widowed mother by her son (Manawydan fab Ll≈∑r, \\"Manawydan, the son of Ll≈∑r\\"), rape and divorce (Math fab Mathonwy, \\"Math, the son of Mathonwy\\"), marriage of a daughter against the will of her father (Culhwch and Olwen). If the girl objected to the marriage, the only way out is self-help: the imposition of almost impossible tasks on the prospective groom (Tochmarc Emire, \\"The Wooing of Emer\\"); escape with a husband of her own choosing (The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr√°inne), or suicide (Longas mac nUislenn, \\"The Exile of the son of Uislius\\"). The already mentioned Queen of Connacht, Medb, broke with all conventions and selected her own husbands, whom she later repudiated when she tired of them. To each warrior from whom she desired support, she promised the \\"Favour of her leg\\" (Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn) and even marriage to her daughter Findabair - when Findabair discovers this, she takes her own life out of shame. Other female figures from Celtic mythology include the weather witch Cailleach (Irish for \\"nun,\\" \\"witch,\\" \\"the veiled\\" or \\"old woman\\") of Scotland and Ireland, the Corrigan of Brittany who are beautiful seductresses, the Irish Banshee (woman of the Otherworld) who appears before important deaths, the Scottish warrior women Sc√°thach, Uathach and Aoife. The Sheela-na-Gig was a common grotesque sculpture which presented an exaggerated vulva. Her significance - ultimately as a fertility symbol - is debated and her dating is uncertain.Sylvia und Paul F. Botheroyd: Lexikon der keltischen Mythologie. pp. 294 f. Possibly the display of the vulva was meant to have an apotropaic power, as in the Irish legend in which the women of Ulster led by Mugain the wife of King Conchobar mac Nessa unveil their breasts and vulvae in order to prevent the destruction of Emain Macha by the raging C√∫ Chulainn.Sievers/Urban/Ramsl: Lexikon zur Keltischen Arch√§ologie.

","title":"Ancient Celtic women"},{"id":"49441829","text":"Das dumme G√§nslein (The Silly Goose) is one in a trio of German animated short films produced in 1944 by Hans Fischerkoesen, who was the chief animator and author. It is a tale of a female goose consumed by adventure and urban glamour in her countryside life, who had to be saved from a cunning fox by her friends and family. The moral of the tale was not be extravagant and adventurous due to its consequences and it not being what one would expect, and promoting that people should live a ‚Äònormal‚Äô German family life. The animation has an underling theme of Nazi propaganda. It symbolises the V√∂lkisch ideology to be traditionally conventional, demonstrating the idea that a woman's main purpose was to produce ‚Äòtrue‚Äô German children, and not be individualistic or sexually sinful. It represents that if you vary from the traditional German life then the consequences could be dire, possibly leading to death. This can relate to the Nazi fear policy, by which people who opposed the regime or were seen as asocial, were punished and it could have eventually lead to their death. The film also indirectly contains anti-Semitism through the character of the cunning fox. Plot The scene begins with the mother goose and her four children imprisoned in a wooden cart traveling to the countryside. While on their journey they pass a vibrant city which includes urban glamour shops influenced by international fashion, an exotic parrot and lively music. The mother goose and the other three siblings are frightened, meanwhile the silly goose is mesmerised by the bright lights and people dancing. The mother drags the goose back away from the urban city surroundings and drops her. Meanwhile, a passing cart is carrying a fox stole. The silly goose touches it when again the mother drags her back. When approaching the countryside the other geese are happy, while the silly goose seems bored with her rural surroundings, at which the mother looks perplexed as to why. A train passes by which quickly shifts this arrangement as the silly goose is excited to see something unnatural, whereas the mother pulls the other siblings back in fear. When they arrive at the farm they are released from the wooden box and allowed to be free in their rural environment. The silly goose then begins to admire herself in the reflection of the water, while the mother teaches the other geese how to drink. It is repeatedly shown in different scenes how the three geese march after their mother and learn from her, whereas the silly goose mocks them. The silly goose then tries to make luxury items out of ordinary things. For example, she uses a caterpillar as a scarf, corks as heels, straw hats and makes eyelashes from pig hairs. The other animals on the farm shake their heads in disapproval. The goose admires herself in a mirror, then her mother smashes the glass and tries to teach her how to lay an egg. After this, a traditional German male goose approaches the silly goose with the intention to court her, however she turns him away. Following this, the goose is approached by a sly fox, shown as peering through the fence and creeping up on her. After stealing a scarecrows clothes, the fox then charms her back to his lair. When entering the lair the fox lets out a sinister laugh. Inside the lair there are geese locked up, a slave cat making music on a xylophone of bones and ants turning a spit roast. The goose then tries to escape and is trapped in the mouth of the fox running through the forest. Eventually she is rescued by all the animals on the farm. After this, the silly goose is with the normal male goose and their four children, which she keeps in line and doesn't allow them to behave in her previous ‚Äòsilly‚Äô ways. Historical Context The animation's main purpose was to instill Nazi ideology onto the public, specifically to indoctrinate the German youth. The underlining theme is to live the ‚Äòtraditional German life‚Äô and not variate towards adventure or luxury, with the animation grounded in nature. It was produced in 1944 when censorship of all media, including child short films, had to go through Joseph Goebbels who was the leader of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 13 March 1933. The totalitarian state wanted to have absolute control of media in an attempt to control the masses, and Goebbels himself claimed: ‚ÄòGerman cinema had the mission of conquering the world as the vanguard of the Nazi troops‚Äô. The principle of the cartoon was to keep the German population in line and implant the idea that if someone was to variate from what they were told, the consequences could be fatal. Between 1939 and 1941, film propaganda would have been less effective because public opinion regarding the war did not need influencing as much. However, from 1941 onwards when German defeats began, tales such as these became valuable to keep the public in order and keep support for the government strong. Lord Northcliffe claimed that ‚ÄòThe bombardment of the German mind was almost as important as the bombardment by cannon‚Äô. The ministry recognised that to reach the maximum target audience, their propaganda must be intellectually slower so more people could understand the basic concepts, and to offer escapism from the serious social and political problems without the audience being aware it was propaganda. In Mein Kampf it recognised that ‚Äòpropaganda must be addressed to the emotions and not to intelligence‚Äô. This led to many children's animations being produced, leading to film being one type of media which helped to crush Hitler's opposition in Germany. This animation includes four main aspects: the role of the mother, being asocial, anti-Semitism and showing Fischerkoesen subtle resistance to some of the Nazi policies. Role of the mother One of the main V√∂lkisch ideologies was the role of the traditional German mother that would produce many children to fulfil their biological obligation. This is represented in the Kinderreich (with many children) policy, which rewarded women who had four or more children. The animation demonstrates this ideology by showing the mother and the silly goose eventually having four children each, despite previously not learning how to lay an egg. In addition, with the silly goose turning away the normal German goose and being charmed by the fox, can relate to the other tropes in Nazi ideology, such as inter-racial marriages being prohibited between people of ‚Äòtrue‚Äô German blood and Jews, with the Nuremberg Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour in September 1935 enforcing this. Being Asocial The animation shows the silly goose in some aspects to be what Nazis would define as ‚Äòasocial‚Äô. The definition of asocial is very elastic and could range from being a thief, alcoholic, prostitute or anyone that resisted the Nazi authority and ideals. With the silly goose consumed by luxury and embracing the facets of Parisian fashion is criticised in many areas in the animation. The most obvious example being when she uses natural aspects to dress and look differently, such as using pig hairs as eyelashes. This was condemned by the Nazi party for two reasons. Firstly, it went against their ideal for a traditional Aryan German race, with women wearing no makeup, being natural and physically healthy. Secondly, with the war affecting the German economy, propaganda was aimed at preventing people buying international goods in order to keep money in the country. Goebbels announced that propaganda for merchandise such as clothes had to be discontinued in 1941, because no one could afford them and it would ‚Äòdraw blood‚Äô. Therefore, the ideal to create a united German nation was achievable by no individuals varying from the country look. This concept is displayed in the animation towards the beginning, where the cart drives past the glamorous urban city and the silly goose is pulled away by her mother and dropped. This represents the first symbol of hurt from embracing the urban city life, reflecting it back to if someone went against V√∂lkisch ideology there could be fatal circumstances, with two thirds of non-Jews in concentration camps, during 1933 to 1943, being defined as asocials. Therefore, the motive to influence the audience to be natural and not be taken to urbanite glamour underlines the animation and can reinforce the idea that the animation was in fact propaganda to indoctrinate the youth. Anti-Semitic influences The character of the fox represented in the cartoon can be symbolic of anti-Semitism during Hitler's dictatorship. Stereotypes of the Jewish population were at their height in 1944, for example being cunning and having large noses, and of course, many factors played into part to alienate and exterminate them from society. Therefore, with the master Aryan race being part of Nazi ideology they used propaganda as a tool for exclusion, with Jews becoming the central characters of many films from 1939 onwards. Although the animation does not directly link the character of the fox to Jews, background of other instances doing this using foxes, rats and pests, can suggest its message was to exterminate them as a necessity and not a crime. An example of this can be Der St√∂renfried, which was a German animation produced in 1940. Its content includes Nazi forces fighting against and eventually beating the fox, with the German people rejoicing at the end. The animation indirectly instils the concept of the corrupt ‚ÄòJew in disguise‚Äô, with an international conspiracy to take over the world, such as in Jud S√ºss. Another example of this can be from a booklet for the German youth called ‚ÄòThe German National Catechism‚Äô, where it includes ‚Äòthe goal of the Jew is to make himself the ruler of humanity‚Äô. The first representation of the fox in the animation is at the beginning with the fox stole on a passing cart. By the silly goose being drawn to it, and the mother goose pulling her away can show the idea that Germans should stay away from Jews. Furthermore, the most prominent representation of the Jew in the animation is the character of the fox that charms the silly goose back to his lair. The method the fox follows to bring her back can be seen as ritualistic and reiterates the theme of a Jewish conspiracy to conquer the world. Therefore, it can be said that the animation was subtly alienating the Jewish population and to some extent trying to justify the exclusion of Jews through the mass killings which began from March 1942. In addition, the way in which the fox is defeated can tell a lot about attitudes towards Jews. With all the farm coming together to chase him away could signify that the Germans needed to be united in their ‚Äòfight‚Äô against the Jewish population. William Moritz argues that Hans Fischerkoesen is in fact subverting the ideology of nazi-ism through the silly goose, pointing that the symbolism being used within the film pushes more against the ideology of fascism and nazi-propaganda. Hans Fischerkoesen‚Äôs Personal Beliefs With the animation being in close contact with Goebbels it clearly had hints of typical Nazi propaganda aspects as stated above. However Fischerkoesen's own personal beliefs on Nazi policies could have been quite different. There are a few aspects within the animation which suggest Fischerkoesen himself did not agree with Nazi policies, such as the concentration camps. For example, the animation shows animal entrapment, brutality and exploitation which could reflect how people were treated in the camps. These could show Fischerkoesen had a humanitarian perspective and did not agree with some of the Nazi's actions, with him working front line in World War One. However, he made the animation to fit into the circumstance as he didn't want to oppose the regime. Links to other animations When Hans Fischerkoesen produced this short animation he also produced two others (as a trio) with the same underlining concept: adventure and luxury would eventually lead to personal downfall. These shorts are: Der Schneemann (The Snowman, 1944) and Verwitterte Melodie (Weathered Melody, 1942), which were both ideas from Horst von M√∂llendorff. Der Schneemann is particularly interesting because it represents the idea that if one were trapped in a given environment, they must be functional to survive, presented in the snowman leaving his environment and having a fatal end. This links to German society, where people would have been expected to stay in their environment and not be adventurous, emphasising the fear policy the Nazis held. Also, there is another animation called Armer Hansi produced in 1943 with a similar concept. Quality of animation to the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda became very important, which is demonstrated in these shorts. As stated by Hans Steinback in 1937, they used film as a messenger of V√∂lkisch ideology, and with the war ongoing Goebbels wanted to represent Germany as growing industrially just as in peacetime, and to be able to compete with the rival; America. To improve the quality for this trio of shorts Fischerkoesen used a combination of 2D and 3D, using the stereo animation stand. When released, the animation became well known for its quality. Emil Reinegger, head of Paris Film Distributors, claimed that it was surprisingly favourable and better than the bulk of American trick films. References Further reading * Ascheid, A. (2003).

She received her Bachelor from Ryerson Polytechnic University, and her Masters from The Ontario College of Art and Design University. She currently works and lives in Toronto, Ontario.  Artistic approach  Beck's artistic practice is characterized by its humour and its accessibility. These characteristics are employed to address her interests, frequently subjects of ecology, economy, labour and questions of fact and fiction. Her work is often large-scale, and can be seen outside of the traditional gallery space as often as inside. In 2001 Beck entered the art scene with her first artwork √ñDE. √ñDE is a company that designs, markets and produces economically affordable weapons using inexpensive materials. The weapons can be purchased in one of seven seasonal colours and assembled using an allan key. √ñDE premiered in Vancouver at the Third Avenue Gallery in August 2001, going on to be exhibited widely, including in Seattle and Philadelphia, and winning her The Canada Council's Joseph S Stauffer Prize, created to \\"encourage young Canadians of outstanding promise or potential.\\" The original √ñDE armoured vehicle will be on display in Calgary at The Military Museums until early September, 2018. Sarah Beck, √ñDE, 2001 In 2009 Beck created Dirty Loonie as Canada's official entry into the VIi√®mes International Jeux de la Francophonie in Beirut, Lebanon, winning Canada a silver medal in the sculpture category. This artwork went on to be exhibited at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in the Cultural Olympiad, and in Toronto's 2012 Nuit Blanche as part of The Museum for the End of the World. Beck also created Postcards from the End as part of The Museum for the End of the World. Beck describes Postcards from the End as \\"sculptural postcards viewers posed with to commemorate their visit\\". The three large-scale works were disaster themed life-sized dioramas meant for the taking and sharing of selfies, and meant to blend photo ops with disaster. In 2015 her work The Light, was exhibited in Jubilee Plaza in Fort McMurray, Alberta at the end of 2015. Created as an epitaph to the last days of the tungsten light bulb, which as of 2015 will no longer be produced in North America, The Light is filled with 360 light bulbs that ran continuously until they all burned out.

In the center the field is low; reaching (at most) 0.35 Teslas. The field rises to as high as 15 Teslas at the ends. This change in the strength is needed to reflect the particles and get them internally trapped (see: the magnetic mirror effect). Heating The plasma is heated using two methods, simultaneously. The first is neutral beam injection, where a hot (25 keV), neutral beam of material is shot into the machine at a rate of 5 megawatts. The second is Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating which is where electromagnetic waves are used to heat a plasma, analogous to microwaving it.

The Greek party met with the Turkish, and Greek soldier, Zissis Karagogos, met with one of the Turkish soldiers who offered to trade cigarettes. The Greek soldier set down his rifle and helmet and as he moved closer, he was fatally shot by a Turkish soldier lying in wait. This sparked a fire-fight between both parties that killed two Turkish soldiers, Lt. Hakan Turkyilmaz and Pvt. Mehmet Kalyon, and wounded a Greek soldier, Dimitris Karayannis. It is unknown why the Greek soldier fired on by Turkish soldiers. Turkish officials said that the incident began when two Greek soldiers crossed the border and were warned to draw back. Then a Greek fired across the border, killing a Turkish private. Other Turkish troops rushed to the scene and in the ensuing battle a Greek soldier and a Turkish lieutenant were killed.Three Killed in Greece-Turkey Border Clas In response to the death of one of its soldier, the Greek defense ministry demanded an apology and compensation. Turkish forces increased security along the border and the Cabinet met in emergency session. The Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned Greek Ambassador to protest the firing. While Greek forces in the area were put on alert.The Associated Press - Three Killed in Border Clash In the end, both sides deemed the exchange a \\"local one\\" and did not escalate the situation. Top military and civilian authorities from both countries later met to discuss a border protocol aimed at preventing future confrontations. Turkish and Greek soldiers have exchanged fire in the past as Greeks tried to stop Iranian refugees from entering the country illegally from Turkey, but this incident was the first in which there have been casualties. During this period Greek soldiers along the border with Turkey were on alert after receiving reports that Turkey planned to help thousands of refugees slip into Greece illegally.United Press International - Greeks, Turks exchange fire, no casualties  See also  * 1987 Aegean crisis - border dispute between Greece and Turkey the next year that almost escalated into an all-out war.

Clark Halyard (1896 1989) was a banker, activist and first woman president of the Milwaukee chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  Biography  Halyard was born in Covington, Georgia. She was the daughter of a sharecropper. Halyard graduated with a degree in education from Atlanta University. She married Wilbur Halyard in 1920. She and her husband lived in Beloit for some time, where they started a NAACP branch there. In 1923, she and her husband moved to Milwaukee. At the time when they had moved to Milwaukee, they discovered white realtors \\"openly discussed strategies to restrict the city's black population\\" to certain areas of town. In 1925, she and her husband co-founded the first black-owned savings and loan in Milwaukee, Columbia Savings and Loan Association. The couple opened the savings and loan with a single ten-dollar bill. This bank allowed black people to apply for loans without facing racial discrimination. It was \\"virtually impossible for blacks to obtain a mortgage so they could purchase a home\\" at the time. To make the savings and loan a success, neither she nor Wilbur Halyard \\"drew a salary\\" for the first 10 years. Halyard worked as a director at Goodwill Industries for 20 years, while at the same time acting as \\"bookkeeper and secretary for Columbia.\\" By the late 1960s, their Columbia's assets were valued at $4 million. Halyard became the first woman president of the Milwaukee chapter of the NAACP in 1951. During her time as president, she \\"increased dues-paying membership from 39 to 1,416 people.\\" She remained active in the NAACP in other capacities, often as treasurer.

At the time of his nomination, Garland was the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This vacancy arose during Obama's final year as president, and shortly after Scalia's death was announced. But even before Obama had named Garland, and in fact only hours after Scalia's death was announced, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void. He said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president‚Äîto be elected later that year.\\"McConnell On Supreme Court Nomination,\\" March 16, 2016, official website of the Republican Leader of the U.S. Senate (Sen. Mitch McConnell), retrieved September 21, 2020.\\"What every Republican senator has said about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year,\\" PBS News Hour, retrieved September 21, 2020 Senate Democrats criticized the move as being unprecedented, and responded saying that there was sufficient time to vote on a nominee before the election. Scalia's death brought about an unusual, but not unprecedented, situation in which a Democratic president had the opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice while the Republicans controlled the United States Senate. Before 2016, such a situation had last arisen in 1895, when a Republican-led Senate confirmed Democrat Grover Cleveland's nomination of Rufus Wheeler Peckham to the Court in a voice vote; conversely, in 1988 a Democratic-led Senate had confirmed Republican Ronald Reagan's nomination of Anthony Kennedy and in 1991, a Senate held 57‚Äì43 by Democrats nevertheless confirmed Justice Clarence Thomas. Political commentators at the time widely recognized Scalia as one of the most conservative members of the Court, and noted that‚Äîwhile many considered Merrick Garland a centrist, and he had been called \\"essentially the model, neutral judge\\"‚Äîa replacement less conservative than Scalia could have shifted the Court's ideological balance for many years into the future. The confirmation of Garland would have given Democratic appointees a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time since the 1970 confirmation of Harry Blackmun. The 11 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican majority refused to conduct the hearings necessary to advance the vote to the Senate at large, and Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress, 293 days after it had been submitted to the Senate. This marked the first time since the Civil War that a nominee whose nomination had not been withdrawn had failed to receive consideration for an open seat on the Court. Obama's successor, Donald Trump (a Republican), nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on January 31, 2017, soon after taking office. Background =Death of Antonin Scalia= Associate Justice Antonin Scalia On February 13, 2016, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly while at the Cibolo Creek Ranch in Shafter, Texas. He was the second of three Supreme Court justices to die in office this century; the others were Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2005. Before him, the last incumbent justice to die was Robert H. Jackson in 1954. Scalia had been appointed associate justice by President Ronald Reagan in September 1986 to fill the vacancy caused by the elevation of William Rehnquist to chief justice, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. He went on to become a part of the court's conservative bloc, often supporting originalist and textualist positions on the interpretation of the constitution, being one of the judges against abortion rights for women and favouring conservative, republican right-wing ideology. Details. The vacancy on the Court created by Scalia's death came during a U.S. presidential election year, the seventh time since 1900 that this has happened. Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution grants plenary power to the president to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court. At the time of Scalia's death, the incumbent president was Barack Obama, a member of the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party held a 54‚Äì46 seat majority in the Senate. Because of the ideological composition of the Court at the time of Scalia's death, and the belief that President Obama could replace Scalia with a much more liberal successor, some concluded that an Obama appointee could potentially swing the Court in a liberal direction for many years to come, with potentially far-reaching political consequences. =Thurmond rule debate = Scalia's election-year death triggered a protracted political battle that did not end until 2017 after a new president had been inaugurated. The Senate's Republican leadership was quick to assert that the vacancy should not be filled until after the 2016 presidential election. They cited a June 1992 speech by then-senator Joe Biden, in which Biden argued that President Bush should wait until after the election to appoint a replacement if a Supreme Court seat became vacant during the summer or should appoint a moderate acceptable to the then-Democratic Senate, as a precedent. Republicans later began to refer to this idea as the \\"Biden rule\\". Biden responded that his position was and remained that the president and Congress should \\"work together to overcome partisan differences\\" regarding judicial nominations. The \\"Biden rule\\" has never been a formal rule of the Senate. PolitiFact noted that Biden's speech was later in the election year than when the GOP blocked Garland, there was no Supreme Court vacancy, there was no nominee under consideration, the Democratic-led Senate never adopted this as a rule, and that Biden did not object to Bush nominating judicial nominees after Election Day. Democrats also countered that the U.S. Constitution obliged the president to nominate and obliged the Senate to give its advice and consent in a timely manner. Republicans argued in response that the Senate was fulfilling its obligation of advice and consent by saying that the next president should make the appointment. There were, however, 11 months left to President Obama's term at the time of Scalia's death, and the Democrats argued that no precedent existed for such a lengthy delay and that previous presidents had nominated individuals in election years. Democrats also argued that even if such a precedent existed, President Obama's term had sufficient time remaining that such a precedent would not apply. The precedent, known as the Thurmond rule, dated back to President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to become chief justice, but had since been inconsistently applied.Russell Wheeler, Judicial Confirmations: What Thurmond Rule?, Brookings Institution (March 19, 2012).Daniel Victor, What Is the 'Thurmond Rule'?, New York Times (February 13, 2016). On February 23, the 11 Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee signed a letter to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stating their unprecedented intention to withhold consent on any nominee made by President Obama, and that no hearings would occur until after January 20, 2017, when the next president took office. This position subsequently became known as the \\"McConnell rule\\". That August, McConnell, who played an instrumental role in keeping Merrick Garland from filling Scalia's vacant seat, heralded the party's uncompromising intransigence by declaring to a crowd in Kentucky, \\"One of my proudest moments was when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.\\" McConnell later called the question of whether the rule should become Senate policy \\"absurd\\", stating that \\"neither side, had the shoe been on the other foot, would have filled [the vacant seat]\\". =Scholars and lawyers urging Senate to consider a nominee= On February 24, 2016, a group of progressive-leaning U.S. constitutional-law scholars sent an open letter to President Obama and the U.S. Senate urging the president to nominate a candidate to fill the vacancy and the Senate to hold hearings and vote on the nominee.Top Constitutional Law Scholars Say No Exception to the Rule in Filling Supreme Court Vacancy in Election Year (February 24, 2016). The letter, which was organized by the progressive American Constitution Society, stated that it would be \\"unprecedented\\" for the Senate to fail to consider a Supreme Court nominee, and \\"would leave a vacancy that would undermine the ability of the Supreme Court to carry out its constitutional duties.\\" The signatories wrote that \\"the Senate's constitutional duty to 'advise and consent'‚Äîthe process that has come to include hearings, committee votes, and floor votes‚Äîhas no exception for election years. In fact, over the course of American history, there have been 24 instances in which presidents in the last year of a term have nominated individuals for the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed 21 of these nominees.\\"Statement of Constitutional Law Scholars on the Supreme Court Vacancy (February 24, 2016). Among the 33 professors signing the letter were Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of California, Irvine School of Law; Adam Winkler of the UCLA School of Law; Kermit Roosevelt III of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, and Gene Nichol of the University of North Carolina School of Law. In a letter sent to President Obama on March 3, 2016, a different group of predominantly progressive scholars of American history, politics, and the law wrote to President Obama to \\"express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination for the Supreme Court made by a president with eleven months to serve in the position.\\"Tanya Somanader, Letter from the Experts: The President's Supreme Court Nominee Deserves a Chance (March 10, 2016). See also PDF version of letter. The scholars wrote: > It is technically in the power of the Senate to engage in aggressive denial > on presidential nominations. But we believe that the Framers' construction > of the process of nominations and confirmation to federal courts, including > the Senate's power of \\"advice and consent,\\" does not anticipate or > countenance an obdurate refusal by the body to acknowledge or consider a > president's nominee, especially to the highest court in the land.

Anything less than that, in our view, > is a serious and, indeed, unprecedented breach of the Senate's best > practices and noblest traditions for much of our nation's history. Signatories to this letter included, among others, Thomas E. Mann, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Norman J. Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin; Pamela S. Karlan of Stanford Law School; Yale Law School professor Harold Hongju Koh; Geoffrey R. Stone of the University of Chicago Law School; and historian James M. McPherson of Princeton University. On March 7, 2016, a group of 356 law professors and other legal scholars released a letter (organized through the progressive judicial advocacy group Alliance for Justice) to the Senate leadership of both parties urging them \\"to fulfill your constitutional duty to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a prompt and fair hearing and a timely vote.\\" The letter writers argued that Senate Republicans' announcement that they would refuse to consider any Obama nominee was a \\"preemptive abdication of duty\\" that \\"is contrary to the process the framers envisioned in Article II, and threatens to diminish the integrity of our democratic institutions and the functioning of our constitutional government.\\"Over 350 law professors urge senators to fulfill their constitutional duty, Alliance for Justice (March 7, 2016). See also full text of letter. Among the signatories to this letter were prominent law professors Charles Ogletree, Kenji Yoshino, and Laurence Tribe. On March 9, 2016, in a letter to Obama and Senate leadership, a group of almost 250 prominent corporate lawyers urged the Senate to hold hearings on the president's nominee.Martha Neil, Fill Scalia vacancy, urge nearly 250 corporate lawyers in letter to Obama and Senate leaders, ABA Journal (March 9, 2016). See also full text of letter. The letter stated that \\"When a vacancy on the court arises, the Constitution is clear ... Article II, Section 2 states that the President 'shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... judges of the Supreme Court' ... Though the Senate may ultimately choose not to consent to the president's nominee, it would be unprecedented for the Senate to refuse to perform its 'advice and consent' role in this context. Not only does the Constitution direct the sitting president to nominate an individual to fill a vacancy on the court no matter whether it is an election year, nearly one third of all presidents have nominated a justice in an election year who was eventually confirmed.\\" The letter, organized by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,Zoe Tillman, Big Law Partners, General Counsel Urge Senate Action on SCOTUS Pick, National Law Journal (March 9, 2016). also expressed concern about the \\"profound effect\\" of an under-staffed Court on the national economy, particularly in close cases. Signatories to the letter came from a number of national law firms, as well as counsel for Google Inc.. On March 10, 2016, the Democratic attorneys general of 19 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia released a letter to Obama and Senate leadership in both parties calling for prompt Senate action on the president's (then yet-to-be-named) nominee.Karen Sloan & Zoe Tillman, Letters Urge Prompt Review on Any Obama Nomination, New York Law Journal (March 11, 2016). See also full text of letter. The letter stated that \\"the states and territories have a unique and pressing interest in a full and functioning Supreme Court\\" and that refusal to consider a nominee would \\"undermine the rule of law and ultimately impair the functioning of state governments.\\" In March 2016, former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr., a Republican, and former Connecticut U.S. senator Joseph Lieberman, an independent, both co-chairs of the problem-solving group No Labels, wrote that \\"there is no modern precedent for the blockade that Senate Republicans have put in place. Even highly-contentious nomination battles in the past, including those over Robert Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas, followed the normal process of hearings and an up-or-down vote. Leaving the current blockade in place could leave a seat on the Court vacant for the remainder of this term and perhaps the next as well, which could leave major cases in limbo until 2018. That is simply not acceptable. We cannot let today's crisis of leadership turn into a full-blown constitutional crisis.\\"Jon Huntsman & Joseph Lieberman, The Republican SCOTUS Blockade Is 'Not Acceptable', Time (March 25, 2016). That same month, John Joseph Gibbons and Patricia Wald, the former chief judges of the Third Circuit and D.C. Circuit, respectively, warned that the Senate's refusal to act on a Supreme Court nomination \\"would set a dangerous precedent, and invite attempts to extend it to other situations where the Executive and the Legislative branches are in political conflict with one another.\\" Gibbons was appointed by a Republican president, while Wald was appointed by a Democratic president.Zoe Tillman, Former Federal Appeals Chief Judges Urge Senate to Act on Supreme Court Nominee, National Law Journal (March 14, 2016). Law professors Robin Bradley Kar and Jason Mazzone, in a May 2016 study published in the NYU Law Review Online, called the situation \\"unprecedented,\\" noting that the Senate had never before transferred a president's appointment power in comparable circumstances to an unknown successor. =Scholarly and legal counterarguments= George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin argued the Constitution imposes no such duty upon the Senate to hold confirmation hearings and to give a nominee an up-or-down vote. Jonathan H. Adler agreed, writing that while he personally has \\"long argued that the Senate should promptly consider and vote on every presidential judicial nominee, ... there is no textual or historical basis\\" for the contention that the Senate has a constitutional obligation to do so. Eugene Volokh argues that there has not been a \\"constant practice of Senators agreeing that every nominee should be considered without regard to there being a looming election\\" and that \\"in the absence of such a practice, we come down to more results-oriented politics.\\" George Mason University law professor David Bernstein argued that while \\"preexisting constitutional norms\\" would suggest that \\"hearings and eventual votes on Supreme Court nominees\\" were mandatory, this norm is not required by the constitutional text and has been undermined by recent political practice. Bernstein also noted that a Democratic-controlled Senate in 1960, in reaction to President Eisenhower's 1956 recess appointment of William J. Brennan Jr., passed a Senate resolution \\"Expressing the sense of the Senate that the president should not make recess appointments to the Supreme Court, except to prevent or end a breakdown in the administration of the Court's business.\\" Noah Feldman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, has said \\"it's hard to argue that [the Constitution] requires the [Senate] to put a nominee to a vote.\\" Vikram Amar, constitutional law professor and dean of the University of Illinois College of Law, wrote that \\"the text of the Constitution certainly does not use any language suggesting the Senate has a legal obligation to do anything,\\" but that the \\"absolutist position\\" taken by Senate Republicans presents \\"grave risks\\" of escalating the judicial-appointment process into \\"extreme moves and countermoves.\\" Nomination =Potential candidates= Prior to Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, media commentators speculated about who might be nominated to fill the vacancy on the Court. A number of writers argued that the Senate Republicans would continue to block the confirmation process regardless of the nominee, and suggested that Obama may as well choose a candidate for political motives. For instance, Michael Tomasky suggested that a nomination of Mariano-Florentino Cu√©llar may encourage Latinos to vote in the November 2016 election and \\"alter the presidential race dramatically as well.\\" Tom Goldstein, arguing that \\"[t]he nomination itself is part of the president's legacy, even if partisan politics prevents confirmation,\\" recommended nominating a black woman to encourage black and female voters to participate in the election. Goldstein concluded that the most likely candidate of such description was Ketanji Brown Jackson. Other commentators suggested that Obama should compromise by selecting a centrist or even moderate conservative candidate. After analyzing voting trends for Supreme Court nominees since the confirmation of Hugo Black in 1937, political scientists Charles Cameron and Jonathan Kastellec explained that \\"even an ideological twin of Justice Stephen Breyer‚Äîthe most moderate of the court's current liberals‚Äîwould fail to get even a majority of votes in the current Senate\\". Without naming potential nominees, Cameron and Kastellec concluded that the Senate would only approve \\"a highly qualified moderate.\\" In that vein, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid suggested the nomination of Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. However, Sandoval soon withdrew his name from consideration. Zachary A. Goldfarb and Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Obama might nominate Sri Srinivasan because he \\"has the sort of impeccable credentials that are much beloved by the Supreme Court bar\\" and that his reputation as a moderate liberal may appeal to conservatives in the Senate. By early March 2016, Obama reportedly scheduled interviews with five candidates‚ÄîMerrick Garland, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Jane L. Kelly, Sri Srinivasan, and Paul J. Watford‚Äîbefore narrowing the list down to three candidates: Srinivasan, Garland, and Watford. Garland had been interviewed for a seat on the Court in 2010, when Justice Elena Kagan was selected to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens. Back in 2010, Republican Senator Orrin G. Hatch publicly said that he had urged Obama to nominate Garland as \\"a consensus nominee\\" who would easily win Senate confirmation. On March 11, 2016 (five days before President Obama nominated Judge Garland), Senator Hatch said: \\"The President told me several times he is going to name a moderate, but I do not believe him. ... [Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably will not do that because this appointment is about the election. So I am pretty sure he will name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants.\\" Also on March 11, 2016, Hatch said that refusal to now consider any Obama nominee to the high court was \\"the chickens coming home to roost\\", and he cited historical episodes as well as old quotations from Democratic senators to explain why. =Announcement= Garland meeting with Democratic U.S. Senator Al Franken Merrick Garland with Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins Garland speaks with Democratic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer On March 16, 2016, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacant seat on the Court. In a formal Rose Garden ceremony, Obama, flanked by Garland and Vice President Joe Biden, declared: \\"I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America's sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even- handedness and excellence. Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term; neither should a Senator.\\" He went on to say: \\"To suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland does not even deserve a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court, when two-thirds of Americans believe otherwise‚Äîthat would be unprecedented.\\" Garland then briefly spoke, stating that \\"fidelity to the Constitution and the law have been the cornerstone of my professional life\\" and promising to \\"continue on that course\\" if confirmed for the Supreme Court. The White House simultaneously released a biographical video of Garland, featuring old photographs of Garland and his family, an interview with the judge, and archival footage of him at the scene of the Oklahoma City bombing, which Garland investigated.Julie Hirschfeld Davis, White House Releases Video of Garland, The New York Times (March 16, 2016). In the video, Garland states: \\"When I am standing with the President and he announces my nomination, I actually think it is going to feel a little bit like it is an out-of-body experience.\\" The selection of the year old Garland, the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell Jr. in 1971 at age , caught prediction markets by surprise. On the PredictIt market, traders predicted that Srinivasan would be the nominee, trading as high as 97% on this outcome. Response to the nomination Immediately following the president's announcement of Garland, Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, announced a firm refusal to consider nominees to the Supreme Court until the next presidential inauguration. Citing what he called \\"the Biden Rule\\", McConnell argued that there should not be a nomination so close to the next presidential and congressional election, but rather that the nomination should await the outcome of that election (which was 8 months away, and 10 months to the next presidential and congressional inaugurations): :\\"The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so of course the American people should have a say in the Court‚Äôs direction‚Ä¶The American people may well elect a President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next President may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.‚Äô ...declaring: :\\"The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next President nominates, whoever that might be.\\" Senator Orrin Hatch said: \\"I think well of Merrick Garland. I think he is a fine person. But his nomination does not in any way change current circumstances.\\" Soon thereafter, Senator Jeff Flake said that Garland should not be confirmed unless Hillary Clinton wins the November presidential election. He argued that should Clinton win, Garland should be confirmed in the Senate's lame-duck session because he is less liberal than any nominee Clinton might put forward. After meeting with Garland in April, Flake reiterated this position. Hatch echoed this sentiment, saying that he was \\"open to resolving this [Garland's nomination after a Clinton win] in a lame duck [session in December].\\" By the beginning of April however, a total of 29 Republicans had announced that even after election, regardless of its outcome, they would not consider the Garland nomination. In April, two Republican Senators, Jerry Moran and Lisa Murkowski, after weeks earlier expressing support for proceeding with hearings as a part of the nomination process, had reversed their positions, saying that they now opposed hearings on Garland's nomination. Two other Republicans, Mark Kirk and Susan Collins, expressed their support for hearings and an up-or-down vote on Garland, with Collins also supporting Garland's nomination. Some Republicans, including Ted Cruz and John McCain, suggested that the Senate might not confirm any nominee to replace Scalia, particularly if Democrats retain control of the presidency. In April 2016, a letter signed by sixty-eight of Garland's former law clerks urging his confirmation was delivered to Senate leaders. The Washington Post summarized the letter as painting \\"a familiar portrait of Garland as a careful judge, a hardworking public servant and a devoted family man.\\" The former clerks wrote: \\"There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland. Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers.\\"Mike DeBonis, Merrick Garland's ex-clerks to Senate: Confirm our old boss to the Supreme Court, Washington Post (April 4, 2016). On May 2, eight former Solicitor General of the United States endorsed Garland as \\"superbly qualified\\", including Republicans Paul Clement, Gregory G. Garre, Theodore Olson, and Ken Starr. On June 21, the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary granted Garland its \\"well-qualified\\" rating. Commenting on his integrity, the ABA noted: \\"Most remarkably, in interviews with hundreds of individuals in the legal profession and community who knew Judge Garland, whether for a few years or decades, not one person uttered a negative word about him.\\" In August 2016, Steve Michel, a New Mexico lawyer, filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to compel Republican leaders in the Senate to take a vote on the nomination. On November 17, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the plaintiff, who had simply alleged he was a voter, had no standing to sue. Over 150,000 people signed a \\"We the People\\" petition posted in November 2016 on the White House website asking President Obama to independently appoint Garland to the Supreme Court, espousing the theory that the Senate had waived its advise and consent role. The petition received an official White House response, but the administration did not embrace the petitioners' point of view. Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress, after languishing 293 days. Donald Trump, Barack Obama's successor, consistently opposed the Garland nomination during the presidential campaign. Soon after taking office, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy caused by Justice Scalia's death; he was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017. Two years later, in May 2019, Senator McConnell was asked what he would do if a Supreme Court justice were to die in 2020, an election year. He stated that the Senate would fill such a vacancy. McConnell repeated the statement in September 2020 following the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, citing a strengthened Republican majority in the Senate after 2018 midterm elections. Effect of vacancy on rulings Scalia's death left the court with eight judges for a majority of its 2015 term and the beginning of its 2016 term, and the vacancy was the second-longest since 1900. With the vacancy persisting for some time, the Court showed a reluctance to accept new cases. The Court's slow pace in accepting new cases reflected \\"an increased cautiousness considering the real possibility of 4‚Äì4 deadlocks on anything ideologically divisive\\".Lawrence Hurley, \\"Divided U.S. Supreme Court cautious about taking new cases\\", Reuters (April 4, 2016). From the time of Scalia's death in late February 2016 until the first week of April 2017, the Court accepted only three cases, none likely to be controversial. By contrast, over the previous five years the Court took up an average of eight cases over the same period. For cases that were not decided before his death, Justice Scalia's votes were not counted, with the cases decided by the remaining eight members of the Court. When the Court issues any ruling with votes split 4‚Äì4, the Court does not publish a written opinion with respect to the merits of the case and the ruling of the lower court is affirmed, although the Court's affirmance has no effect as precedent in future cases. Citing the Court's practices following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1954, Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog suggested in February 2016 that the Court was more likely to set evenly-divided cases for reargument after a new justice is appointed to the Court. However, the Court split 4‚Äì4 in at least five cases of the 2015 term: * Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, an important case on the funding of public-sector labor unions;Amy Davidson, 4‚Äì4 at the Supreme Court, New Yorker (April 1, 2016). * Hawkins v.

Previously named the Wild Europe Field Programme, it was initiated in 2011 by four organisations: WWF-Netherlands, ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe and Conservation Capital, following the \\"Conference on Wilderness and Large Natural Habitat Areas\\" (Wild Europe) conference in Prague in 2009. The organisation sees opportunities for what it calls \\"nature conservation\\" in changes to Europe's landscape through a change in farming practices that results in small farmers, shepherds and other grazing livestock farmers giving up nearly one million hectares of land each year. The initiative aims to redesign around one million hectares of land by 2022 and create wilderness areas across Europe.Wouter Helmer et al.: Rewilding Europe: A New Strategy for an Old Continent In 2014, Luigi Boitani, the president of the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe signed a cooperation agreement with Rewilding Europe. Locations Rewilding Europe is working in eight rewilding areas located in 10 European countries. So far, the initiative has chosen pilot sites in the following eight areas: = Western Iberia rewilding area = Located in Portugal in the C√¥a Valley on the border with Spain. Rewilding Europe is trying to increase the number of semi-wild livestock such as feral horses and cows. Due to depopulation and land abandonment, there is a significant decrease in grazing, which has caused natural succession and more plant cover in the landscapes. The organisation promotes grazing as a tool to lower the risk of fire. The organisation claims more \\"wild\\" livestock will lead to more diverse \\"mosaic landscapes\\", which may improve conditions for populations of roe deer and species extinct from the region such as Iberian ibex. Besides the promotion of conservation grazing, the organisation is also occupied with promoting ecotourism, advocacy in order to convince the Portuguese government to set aside more land in order to create a biological corridor, and a project to increase number of the wolves in the area. = Danube Delta rewilding area = The 580,000 hectare large delta is home to massive amounts of water birds of all kinds, most notably pelicans of two species, herons, storks, cormorants and terns. It is a favourite staging area for passage migrants and also wintering grounds for masses of migrating water birds from the steppes, the boreal forests and the tundras further north. The region has some of Europe's very few remaining grazed mosaique forest landscapes, kept in their natural state by the wild horses and wild cattle still present. Working with partners, the Rewilding Danube Delta team is working to significantly improve the ecological integrity and natural functioning of 40,000 hectares of wetland and terrestrial delta habitat, using rewilding principles on a landscape scale. Revitalised and self-governing natural processes, particularly flooding and natural grazing, will govern landscape formation, driving other natural processes, wildlife comeback, increased biodiversity and the development of a nature-based economy. The Danube Delta rewilding area is part of the Tauros breeding programme, managed by the Taurus Foundation and Rewilding Europe. The aim of the programme is to bring back a functional, wild version of the aurochs ‚Äì called the Tauros ‚Äì by establishing viable wild populations of this animal in several European locations. Due to translocations in 2016 and 2017, the number of Tauros grazing near Sfantu Gheorghe is now 18 animals. Rewilding Europe works to create new opportunities for delta communities by supporting the development of nature-based business. = Southern Carpathians rewilding area = Part of the region which counts more than 1 million hectares of protected areas already in place, rich wildlife, large intact forests, a high concentration of biodiversity, relatively intact wild landscapes, wild rivers, and large areas of mosaic vegetation largely shaped by traditional farming and grazing practices is a good start for nature conservation work. The work of Rewilding Europe and its partners is focused on bringing back the European bison. Since 2013, Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania have been working together in the Southern Carpathians rewilding area to reintroduce this iconic species. The major objective of this ongoing project is to create a demographically and genetically viable population in the Southern Carpathians, comprising free- roaming sub-populations in the Tar√ßu Mountains and nearby Poiana RuscƒÉ Mountains. So far bison releases took place in 2014 and 2015. In June 2016, a third bison release took place as part of the European Commission-funded LIFE Bison project, with a fourth release of nine animals taking place in April 2017. Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania work together to create one of the largest contiguous wild areas in Europe. = Velebit rewilding area = Situated on a mountain chain right on the Adriatic coast in Croatia, Velebit rewilding area is one of the wildest areas of the whole Mediterranean. The area hosts two national parks, a biosphere reserve, several hiking trails, old-growth forests, deep canyons, ancient open lands and wildlife like Balkan chamois, red deer, brown bear, wolf and lynx. Many local inhabitants have moved out of the area towards the coast. As a result, many areas of this region are now characterised by land abandonment, rural exodus and fading cultural tradition. Rewilding Europe is working with its partners to transform challenges into opportunities. This has seen the establishment of the 17,000-hectare Velebit Nature Reserve, situated between two large national parks. Here rewilding is offering a fresh approach to wildlife management and underpinning the development of a local nature-based economy, creating a wildlife and ecological corridor in the Velebit mountains. Wildlife watching hides are constructed and new ones will be built in future to create job opportunities benefiting the local community. In collaboration with the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Forestry, the Rewilding Velebit team are working to have the Ramino Korito old-growth beech forest, located in the southern part of Velebit Mountains, designated a special woodland reserve, highlighting the rarity and biological value. On the Lika Plains, a grassland located in the foothills of Velebit Mountains, Rewilding Europe is working to reintroduce wild and semi-wild grazers. Since it began in 2015 the project has doubled in size and now extends across 1000 hectares. On December 10, 2014 hiker Zdenko ƒêaniƒá was killed by Sayaguesa bull. = Central Apennines rewilding area = Characterized by a rich diversity of ecosystems and, therefore also wildlife species. The work of Rewilding Europe and its partners in Central Apennines focuses on developing large ‚Äûcoexistence corridors‚Äú by connecting the local economy with wilder nature in four corridors collectively covering more than 40,000 hectares. In the protected areas, the Abruzzo and Majella National Parks and Sirente Velino Regional Park, the corridors are aimed to benefit the wildlife populations, and the quality of nature and nature related experiences. The 10-year project's goal is to reduce bear mortality and conflict by installing traffic accident prevention measures, removing old fencing, restoring and improving signage, and distributing new mobile electric fences. Furthermore, RE and its partners work on supporting nature-based enterprises in and around corridor areas, and raising awareness about wildllife and nature conservation amongst local communities and people visiting the area is. = Rhodope Mountains rewilding area = The Rhodope Mountains is the only breeding area for griffon vultures in Bulgaria and also the most important breeding site for the globally threatened Egyptian vulture on the Balkan peninsula. The work of Rewilding Europe focuses on restoring food chains in Rhodope Mountains. Restoring natural food chains is a flagship project of Rewilding Europe, supported by the European Commission through the LIFE project ‚ÄúConservation of black and griffon vultures in the cross-border Rhodope mountains‚Äù. Rewilding Europe's main focus is to help vultures and other scavenging species by boosting the availability of wild herbivore carcasses, thereby closing the circle of life. Together with local partners Rewilding Europe is increasing the number of local ungulates through several annual red deer and fallow deer releases, with reintroduced animal behaviour monitored through the use of GPS collars. Rewilding Europe is boosting biodiveristy through mosaic landscape creation. Together with partners, Rewilding Europe is creating space for natural processes like forest regeneration, free flowing rivers, herbivory and carnivory to impact ecosystems. Rewilding Europe and Rewilding Rhodope extends its efforts to restore steppe habitat, and increase the population of the endangered European ground squirrel. = Oder Delta rewilding area = The region is a unique combination of rich mosaic of large wild continental, marine and freshwater ecosystems. The region stretches over more than 250 000 hectares, of which nearly 70 000 hectares are the open waters of the lagoon. Rewilding Europe and local partners have started work on several pilot business projects here, based on the exploration of nature-based economic opportunities. A developing network of local wilderness guides, wildlife watching tours and hides, lodging and other nature-based enterprises is creating jobs and burgeoning support for rewilding. The eventual aim is to develop an alternative, sustainable and competitive model of land and sea use for local landowners, entrepreneurs and residents. The Oder Delta team is working with partners to boost biodiversity in the delta by improving habitats. The Rewilding Oder Delta team is currently working to restore fish populations and fish migration in the Stettin Lagoon and associated rivers. Activities such as include the rewilding of river banks, the restoration of natural hydrodynamics, the removal of obstacles to support fish migration, and the re-wetting of areas adjacent to waterways are being performed. = Lapland rewilding area = Currently working in collaboration with fishing associations on both the R√•ne and Pite√•, Rewilding Lapland is now working hard to boost fish migration, through activities such as spawning ground restoration and the removal of artificial obstacles. Sonar- based fish counters are used on both rivers to measure results. Together with river restoration, Rewilding Lapland is exploring new nature-based business opportunities, providing support to enterprises involved in fishing and otter watching on the lower R√•ne. Rewilding Lapland and local partners to support guided reindeer migration, raising awareness of these threats and supporting Sami communities in their fight for traditional grazing rights. Rewilding Lapland collaborates with Sami communities to develop wildlife watching businesses and guided reindeer tourism, the Rewilding Lapland team and partners are working to grow a local nature-based economy and reduce human- wildlife conflict. Rewilding Europe Tools Rewilding Europe uses a number of tools to support its activities. =European Rewilding Network= European Rewilding Network (ERN) is an online network set up to connect areas in the continent where rewilding efforts are taking place, including both the core Rewilding Europe locations as well as many other sites with externally run projects. Promoting the sharing of knowledge and experience between the many projects and locations is a main goal of the network. The tools ERN uses are Online Seminars (webinars) held quarterly on various rewilding topics. ERN forum, open and free to all members, this online platform is used to post questions and information, interact at any time, and view previous webinars on a wide range of rewilding-related topics. ERN Bridge, is a virtual bridge set up in hopes to close the gap between the needs of the vast numbers of rewilding initiatives with students and volunteers searching to gain experience by working in nature conservation and rewilding. Direct access to Rewilding Europe Capital (REC), Europe's first ‚Äòrewilding enterprise‚Äô funding facility that provides financial loans to new and existing business that catalyse, support and achieve positive environmental and socio-economic outcomes that support rewilding in Europe. ERN members are eligible for a direct access to European Wildlife Bank, a tool designed to facilitate the reintroduction and restocking of herbivores to rewilding areas across the European continent. =Rewilding Europe Capital= Rewilding Europe Capital (REC) is the first ‚Äòrewilding enterprise‚Äô funding facility that provides financial loans to new and existing business that catalyse, support and achieve positive environmental and socio-economic outcomes that support rewilding in Europe. European Investment Bank provided Rewilding Europe Capital with a 6 million euro loan finance contract. It is the first project of the ‚ÄúBank on Nature Initiative‚Äù, set up by the European Commission. The signing ceremony took place in the Berlaymont Building, headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. REC forms part of the enterprise component of Rewilding Europe, which is working to build a business case for wild nature in Europe. REC was established to positively stimulate enterprise economies connected to natural landscapes and their wildlife. REC achieves this by providing commercial business loans to businesses that can: positively address negative socio-economic impacts caused by rural land abandonment; directly and indirectly support rewilding processes and activities in Europe and to those which deliver economic returns from nature and wildlife related sectors that also work to conserve natural landscapes, capital and rural cultures and heritage connected to them. By 2018 Rewilding Europe in total loaned out to 18 enterprises the sum of 520,000 euros. =European Safari Company= Launched at the end of 2016, European Safari Company (ESC), is a dynamic online booking platform dedicated to offering authentic and personalized nature and wildlife- based travel experiences. Heavily committed to providing clients with access to wilder nature, local cultures, spectacular landscapes and unique wildlife experiences, the European Safari Company differentiates itself through its strong connection and support for rewilding and nature-based economies. European Safari Company supports and connects locally based partners with unique experiences the travellers. =European Wildlife Bank= European Wildlife Bank (EWB) a tool Rewilding Europe uses to help bring back more natural numbers of the original native herbivores in our rewilding areas. These big grazers and browsers play key roles for the natural functioning of Europe's ecosystems. Tauros, wild horses and European bison are an example of the species involved in the European Wildlife Bank. European Wildlife Bank developed a database for all the animals in the bank. This includes information on births and deaths in all relevant areas across Europe, the start and end dates of contracts, the yearly availability of animals, and the demand for animals from new rewilding areas. By 2018 Rewilding Europe signed 16 contracts with partner organisations in nine countries. =Rewilding Europe Policy Work= Titled \\"Making Space for Rewilding: Creating an enabling policy environment\\" is a policy brief written by Dr. Paul Jepson, Course Director at the School of Geography and Environment at the University of Oxford and Frans Schepers, Managing Director of Rewilding Europe. The brief was written with the aim to make rewilding widely acceptable and recognizable as an innovative conservation method. The brief communicates that rewilding as such represents a growing movement in Europe and has attained scientific, practical and media presence. The interviews have been conducted with ten experts from the field of EU nature and legislation and in rewilding to explore the opportunities to create a policy environment which would support fuller expression of rewilding visions and principles. With the help of this brief, Rewilding Europe works on getting support on enabling environment for rewilding in its nature conservation and land-use policies. Four main targets to be implemented in the EU policy are: 1) recognizing rewilding as a new conservation approach emerging from the inter-disciplinary conservation science interacting with currents in culture and society, 2) positions rewilding as a complimentary approach with the potential to extend the scope and impact of the EU nature policy in a cost-effective manner, supporting better implementation of the Nature Directives and 3) undertakings to support and invest in rewilding initiatives and studies and engage in dialogue with the rewilding movement in preparation for the 2030 biodiversity strategy. In March 2017, a coalition of five organisations kicked off a new initiative to promote and strengthen the EU ecological restoration agenda. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding, Rewilding Europe, BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, WWF European Policy Office, the European Environmental Bureau and the German Institute for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), launched this 3-year initiative, funded by WWF Netherlands. The overall aim of the project is to strengthen the EU restoration agenda and ensure that specific actions are taken to create a coherent ecological network in Europe, by promoting and using rewilding principles.  Rewilding Europe Publications  Since its establishments Rewilding Europe publishes annual reviews covering its activities, achievements in rewilding areas, specific ten-year objectives, news about rewilding, nature-based economies, nature-based tourism, wild nature and more. Rewilding Europe published a brochure on: *Policy Brief-making space for rewilding *A Vision for a Wilder Europe Furthermore, three species publications can be found on the official website: *Rewilding Horses in Europe *The Aurochs Born to Be Wild *Rewilding Bison Plan ‚Äì a ten years plan Some of the practical guides include: *Wildlife watching hides - the only available publication on the market about ways to design and build professional wildlife watching hides. *Natural Grazing ‚Äì Practices in the Rewilding of Cattle and Horses - the publication written to help rewilding initiatives to learn and adopt some of the latest lessons and practices on setting up and developing natural grazing initiatives. *Circle of Life ‚Äì a new way to support Europe‚Äôs scavengers - Rewilding Europe's and Dutch NGO ARK Nature mutual publication aiming to help Europe's scavengers by encouraging a fresh look at how herbivore carcasses are managed across the continent. Various scientific publications have also been published such as: *Wildlife comeback in Europe *WILD10 proceedings *Aurochs Genetics study =Rewilding Europe‚Äôs work with universities= Rewilding Europe engages with many European universities, as rewilding is a future-oriented, long-term conservation approach, and which requires raising awareness of the younger generations. Some of the universities with which Rewilding Europe has good connections are Oxford, Cambridge, Leipzig, Madrid, Amsterdam, Zagreb and Warsaw.

The process is associated with Parametricism a style within contemporary avant-garde architecture, promoted as a successor to post-modern architecture and modern architecture. History Parametric thinking emerged as a theory-driven design education, project and delivery movement in the early 2010s, with its earliest practitioners harnessing and adapting the then new parametric design software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture and related design fields. In the architecture education context in 2011 professors of the schools of architecture David Karle and Brian Kelly of University of Nebraska published advocacy for a paradigm shift in design education. Karle and Kelly also highlighted that \\"digital tools are currently being used in design schools across the country. This paradigm in both education and practice of architecture is continually changing the profession, from the way in which design is conceived, represented, documented, and fabricated. Parametric design can be defined as series of questions to establish the variables of a design and a computational definition that can be utilized to facilitate a variety of solutions. Parametric thinking is a way of relating tangible and intangible systems into a design proposal removed from digital tool specificity and establishes relationships between properties within a system. It asks architects to start with the design parameters and not preconceived or predetermined design solutions.\\".http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks.id- acadiaregional2011_012 Parametric thinking in the design process context of best practice as defined by designer/technologist Chris Swartout of M Moser Associates is \\"a pedagogic approach that combines design and generative solution delivery through reliance on a multidisciplinary team‚Äôs knowledge expertise at the outset of the project.

History Construction of the palace was commissioned in 1560 by the widow of Giovanni di Bartolomeo Malvezzi, Paola di Antonio Maria Campeggi; the design was by Bartolomeo Triachini. The facade rises on the narrow street of San Donato. In 1725 the Marquis Giuseppe Maria Malvezzi de' Medici (1670‚Äì1736) commissioned the design of the scenic staircase from Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena and construction completed by Alfonso Torreggiani. In the mid-nineteenth century, Giovanni Malvezzi (1819‚Äì1892), refurbished the palace under the direction of Francesco Cocchi. In 1931 the building was sold by Aldobrandino Malvezzi (1881‚Äì1961), professor at the University of Florence, to the Province of Bologna. Interiors The rooms of the main floor maintain much of Cocchi's 19th-century wall decor. The Sala dello Zodiaco has ceiling frescoes of the zodiac.

The last ironclad completed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was laid down in January 1884, launched in July 1887, and completed in September 1889. She was armed with a main battery of three guns and had compound steel plating of the same thickness on her armored belt. The ship had an uneventful career, in large part due to her rapid obsolescence. She made trips to foreign countries to represent Austria-Hungary, but was reduced to a coastal defense ship by 1906. She continued in this role through World War I, based at Cattaro Bay, where her crew took part in the Cattaro Mutiny in early 1918. After the war, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and renamed Kumbor, but she remained in their inventory for only a year, being sold for scrap in 1922. Design Line drawing of Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf In the decades that followed the Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866, naval expenditure in the Austro-Hungarian Empire were drastically reduced, in large part due to the veto power the Hungarian half of the empire held. Surrounded by potentially hostile countries powers on land, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was more concerned with these threats, and so naval development was not prioritized.Gardiner, p. 267 Admiral Friedrich von P√∂ck argued for several years to improve the strength of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, finally winning authorization to build the center battery ship in 1875.Sondhaus, pp. 37‚Äì39 He spent another six years trying in vain to secure a sister ship to Tegetthoff.Sondhaus, p. 54 Finally, in 1881, P√∂ck succeeded in securing funding for a new ironclad, authorized as \\"Ersatz \\", a replacement for the earlier ironclad frigate.Sondhaus, p. 86 The new ship, to be named Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, cost 5.44 million gulden.Sondhaus, p. 100 The design for the new ship was prepared by Josef Kuchinka, the Director of Naval Construction for the Austro-Hungarian Navy; a second ship, , was authorized at the same time. Nearly another decade would pass before the Austro-Hungarian Navy secured funding for new capital ships, the three s begun in 1893.Gardiner, p. 272 =General characteristics and machinery= Model of Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of , and she displaced . Her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer steel hull plating was riveted; it was also extensively sub-divided into watertight compartments and had a double bottom. She was fitted with electrical pumps that had a capacity of of water per hour. Her crew varied between 447 and 450 officers and enlisted men throughout her career. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino manufactured Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolfs propulsion system.\\"The New Austrian Ironclad\\", p. 141 The ship was powered by a pair of two-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines, driving two screw propellers. Steam for the engines was provided by ten coal-fired fire- tube boilers that were trunked into two funnels. Her propulsion system was rated to provide for a top speed of . With forced draft, the power could be increased to , though the increase in speed was modest, to . The ship was fitted with four electrical generators to power internal lighting and searchlights. =Armament and armor= Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolfs aft barbette gun Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was armed with a main battery of three 35-caliber guns mounted singly in open barbettes. Two were placed forward in sponsons over the battery deck to maximize end-on fire, with the third placed aft. The guns were manufactured by Krupp, while the carriages that carried them were built by Armstrong Mitchell & Co.. Each of the forward guns had an arc of 180 degrees, while the stern gun could traverse 270 degrees, all hydraulically operated. The guns fired a shell using a charge of brown powder, which produced a muzzle velocity of . While the open barbettes provided a wide field of fire for the slow-firing guns, they were rapidly rendered obsolete by the successful application of quick-firing (QF) technology to large-caliber artillery pieces. The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of six 35-caliber guns, also built by Krupp. These guns fired a shell with a propellant charge. She carried seven QF guns for close-range defense against torpedo boats; five were 44-caliber guns and the other two were shorter 33-caliber pieces, all built by Hotchkiss. Her gun armament was rounded out by a pair of 44-caliber QF guns and a pair of 15-caliber landing guns for use by landing parties. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried four torpedo tubes; one was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and one on each broadside. Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was protected with compound armor manufactured by the Dillinger H√ºtte works in Germany.Sondhaus, p. 90 The ship's armored belt was 305 mm thick amidships, where it protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces, and reduced to elsewhere. Transverse bulkheads capped the ends of the thickest portion of the belt, with the forward bulkhead and the aft bulkhead thick. An armored deck thick protected the ship's vitals from shells that passed over the side armor. The barbettes for the main battery were thick. Service history Painting of an Austro-Hungarian squadron, led by Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, in Kiel, Germany Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf c. 1915 as a station ship in Cattaro Bay SMS Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was laid down on 25 January 1884 at the Navy Dockyard in Pola. She was launched on 6 July 1887 and then began fitting out, which was completed in September 1889.Gardiner, p. 271 Embarrassingly for the Habsburgs, the ship's namesake had committed suicide earlier that year. In 1890, the German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, invited the Austro-Hungarian fleet to take part in the annual fleet training exercises in August. Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, the ironclad Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, and the protected cruiser were sent to Germany under the command of Rear Admiral Johann von Hinke. While en route, the squadron made visits in Gibraltar and Britain; during the latter stop, the ships took part in the Cowes Regatta, where they were reviewed by Queen Victoria. The ships also stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark and Karlskrona, Sweden. During the voyage back to Austria- Hungary, the squadron visited Cherbourg, France and Palermo, Italy. Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf experienced repeated difficulties with her engines on the trip, but it was nevertheless considered to be a great success in the Austro- Hungarian Navy.Sondhaus, p. 110 In 1892, celebrations to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first trans-Atlantic voyage were held in several countries; Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I represented Austria-Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa, Italy, Columbus's birthplace. While there, she was inspected by King Umberto I of Italy and his son Victor Emmanuel III.Sondhaus, p. 112 Already by 1898, the ship was regarded by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as a second-rate vessel, after less than 10 years in service. The rapid pace of naval development in the late 19th century had quickly rendered her obsolescent.Sondhaus, pp. 144, 158 Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was reclassified as a coastal defense ship in 1906. In 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to sell the ship, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, and Tegetthoff to Uruguay to raise funds for new projects, but the deal fell through.Sondhaus, p. 219 After Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in July 1914, beginning World War I, the ship was stationed in Cattaro Bay under Commander Richard Florio, the leader of Mining Command II. The force also included an old destroyer, four torpedo boats, a minelayer, and two minesweepers, among other minor vessels. She remained there for the duration of the conflict.O'Hara et. al., p. 8 By early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard the armored cruiser and quickly spreading to other ships.Halpern, pp. 49‚Äì50 Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf as she steamed to the Bay of Teodo, the outermost part of Cattaro Bay. The batteries scored a single hit that killed two men, which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. On the morning of 3 February, the s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed.Sondhaus, pp. 318‚Äì324Halpern, pp. 52‚Äì53 With the end of the war in November 1918 and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the fledgling Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in March 1921.

He was elevated to vice president of the parliament in 1988, and retired in 1991 as its leader. Prior to his political career, he worked as a human rights lawyer. Career Born in Changtu County in 1920, Liang obtained an LLD and SJD from Japan's Meiji University, after having studied at Changchun Law and Political University. In 1941, he became a prosecutor in Changchun. In the midst of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liang became an intelligence operative based in northeastern China, feeding information within the Japanese-occupied territory to Chongqing, the provincial capital of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. Liang was arrested and taken as a Japanese prisoner of war in 1944. He was released upon Japanese surrender in 1945. The experience left a tremendous impression on Liang, who would make the cause of human rights a motif of his life's work. Liang was elected as a legislator for his home province of Liaoning in 1948 as hostilities between Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party forces resumed following the Japanese surrender. Liang followed Chiang to Taiwan after the KMT were driven off the mainland completely in 1949. Under martial law in Taiwan, Liang gained a reputation as a fierce defender of human rights and advocated non-violence with regards to the protest movement, in contrast to the more militarist wing of the KMT. He stepped forward in 1960 to defend pro-democracy activist Lei Chen, who was charged with sedition for criticizing Chiang's regime. Liang's defense of Lei angered Chiang, who strongly considered Liang's expulsion from the Kuomintang. Despite this threat, Liang later defended Peng Ming-min, who stood accused of the same charges in 1964. After Chiang's death in 1975, Liang worked as a troubleshooter for the better part of a decade between Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, and the Tangwai movement as the government began to relax some controls on free speech and political dissent. Liang also took credit for persuading Chiang Ching-kuo to handle protests in a peaceful manner. Liang was one of the founding members of the National Unification Council formed in 1990. Alt URL In 1991, Liang became the leader of the Legislative Yuan. He was involved in a fight on the floor of the parliament that same year. It began when Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Chun-hsiung hit Liang in the face, causing Liang to respond in kind. Liang was also injured by a glass thrown by Ju Gau-jeng. In addition to his position as a legislator, Liang was also a senior advisor to President Lee Teng-hui. After his retirement from politics, Liang became president of the Straits Peaceful Reunification Association. Personally, he continually pushed for Chinese unification, opposed Lee's policy of Taiwanization, and repeatedly attempted to expel Lee from the Kuomintang. Liang died of anaphylactic shock caused by pneumonia at Cathay General Hospital in Taipei on 27 August 2004, at the age of 84.

The street is situated in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood and is home to four listed buildings. The street has existed since at least the 1400s, when it was known as Sturisgade and Stus Gaden, probably for councillor Jep Sture, who had a house there. It was officially given its current name in 1796. In the middle of Studsgade lies the small square Rykind from where the narrow alley Sn√¶vringen leads to Mejlgade.  History  Studsgade was the northern inroad to the Medieval town, and like other roads leading into the town, it was built on at an early time. In the 1400s, it was a street of significance. Mejlgade was established at a later time and became the thoroughfare for traffic from Gren√• while Studsgade was turned in the direction of Randers, so it included the northern part of today's N√∏rreport. Studsgade may have had a city gate in the direction of Gren√•, but in the 1700s it had been moved to the site of the current Aarhus School of Architecture. In 1757, a new road was opened from Studsgade to Christiansbjerg in the north, which funneled a lot of traffic from Munkegade's Port to Studsgade. The increased traffic made Studsgade more useful for merchants, and several merchant's houses from that time can be found along the street today.

Much of the show's promotion and marketing concentrated on the production's all-male cast, and Davies' muscular physique hadn't gone unnoticed, with 8 Days Magazine featuring him as their Shirtless Guy of the Week in the run-up to the show opening at the Esplanade Theatre on 4 November 2015. The Singaporean edition of Esquire Magazine also ran a four-page interview with Davies. Davies revived the role during the show's run at Park Theatre, London in February and March 2017 to enthusiastic reviews. Debbie Gilpin of Broadway World described his portrayal as \\"without doubt this is one of the standout lead performances of the year so far\\" and Jane Kemp of WhatsOnStage.com commented \\"Alex is played with brutal splendour by Jonno Davies\\". The show transferred to the New World Stages theatre, off Broadway, New York in September 2017 with Davies, making his US stage debut, leading a new, all-American supporting cast. Reviews of the New York production were polarised, with Helen Shaw from Time Out describing the show as \\"rancid and confused\\", and vulture.com's Sarah Holdren commenting that it was \\"shockingly unshocking\\" with Davies' performance as \\"a bit unvarying\\" being examples of bad reviews. On the other hand, Roma Torre from New York One stated \\"Davies, fresh from the London production, is phenomenal\\" and Frank Sheck from The Hollywood Reporter enthused \\"Davies, repeating his London stage success and making his U.S. theatrical debut, is so physically charismatic you can't take your eyes off him\\" typifying the praise. Davies' portrayal was strong enough for The New York Times' Michael Paulson to include him as the only actor in a \\"Tomorrow's Marquee Names, Now in the Making\\" feature. Whilst in New York, Davies modelled for several fashion designers and clothing manufacturers, including Loris Diran, Florshiem, Scarci and Cego. In addition to performing in A Clockwork Orange, Davies played the title role in Dracula at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2014 and was also a cast member of the Olivier Award-nominated production of Shakespeare in Love at the Noel Coward Theatre in London's West End in 2015. In June 2019, it was announced that Jonno Davies had been added to the cast of the then-forthcoming Amazon Prime series The Hunt (subsequently renamed Hunters), starring Al Pacino. Davies played the recurring character Tobias in the series. Davies has appeared in several TV series and films, including Kingsman: The Secret Service as Lee Unwin, Casualty, Spotless, Silent Witness, Hollyoaks and Doctors. He plays the role of Andrew King in the British cyber-crime thriller King of Crime released at the end of 2018. Davies trained at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, graduating in 2013. He was Italia Conti's nominee at the Spotlight Prize competition in his final year. He has been in a relationship with actress Rachel Bright, best known for playing Poppy Meadow in EastEnders, since 2014. They are due to be married in October 2020.

A cat behaviorist can be officially certified with years of college. However, it is also possible for a behaviorist to work locally without completing extensive training.  Education  An Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist holds a degree from a college or university. Animal behavior study is essential, with focus on biological or behavioral science. The degree includes a thesis conducted with intense research. The coursework requires several credits in ethology, animal behavior, comparative psychology, animal learning, conditioning and animal psychology (experimental psychology). Associate behaviorist requirements also need experience along with the education. The Animal Behavior Society requires two or more years of experience with applied animal behavior and interaction with particular species. At least three letters of recommendation are necessary to prove experience and education. A Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist holds a doctoral degree with focus on animal behavior, and possesses five years of experience, or holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine that requires two years of residency in animal behavior and three years of experience in applied animal behavior. The coursework and endorsements are identical to the Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist. However, a Certified Animal Behaviorist will have to obtain the skills necessary for working closely with a species as a researcher, be an intern or research assistant, and show original creations or interpretations of animal behavior.  Duties  It is a common goal for the cat behaviorist to sort out problem behaviors and to create a strong communication between owner and pet. A cat behaviorist will work with both the cat and owner to achieve understanding between the relationships. They also concentrate on the unique changes in behavior in the pet and normal behavior so they can identify any irregular activities. They can even work along with veterinarians to distinguish the right medications for the animal. As part of their duties, it is common for a behaviorist to work in a close environment with the cat, inspecting every detail necessary. A cat behaviorist must use their training of animal behavior to study responses and issues to lessen anxiety or fears rooted in the environment or elsewhere. They may question the owner's habits, house structure and living spaces of the pet to pinpoint certain concerns. It may be possible that in order to stop any unwanted behaviors, the owner of the pet will have to change their behavior first. Understanding each other is one of many steps to peace in a warring household, and a cat behaviorist exists to provide just that: a link of communication between cat and owner. They aid in preventing or stopping psychological, health, and physical problems in the cat, such as scratching, biting, fighting, obesity, urine marking and more. A behaviorist will also inform or educate the owners about development stages in the cat in order to create an understanding. Once the owner understands the physical and social needs of a cat, behavior issues and other problems will decline. A cat behaviorist will encourage socialization between the guardian and the cat to aid the process and gain a beneficial relationship. Social learning is extremely important for a cat and a cat behaviorist recognizes this and will incorporate these factors into the daily life. They promote healthy learning and stimulation with play and interaction. A cat behaviorist will also describe what is normal behavior and what is not, so that the owner can continue making that distinction and continue to help the cat.  Certification  An applied animal behaviorist can specialize not just with cats, but with dogs, horses, and even parrots. A certified behaviorist will have undergone graduate training in courses such as zoology, biology and animal behavior in certain universities. Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (CAABS) are behaviorists with a doctoral degree and Associate Certified Applied Behaviorists (ACAABS) are those who studied with a master's degree. There are various different organizations and associations that provide certification. The American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB) has a list of requirements before an individual can become board-certified, including an internship, examinations, creating a scientific journal and more. The Animal Behavior Society (ABS) has two levels of certification: Associate Certified and Certified, and a fee along with other conditions such as hours to be completed. The Animal Behavior Institute (ABI) provides numerous classes and opportunities to become certified as well. The Association of Pet Behavior Counsellors (APBC), located in the United Kingdom, also includes courses and available institutes in which to become certified. The Companion Animal Sciences Institute (CASI) will give credit and programs that contribute toward certification.  Employment  With a certified degree in animal behaviorism, a cat behaviorist can find a place of work in different fields. The need for animal specialty care and service is expected to increase, so jobs are in high demand. Specifically, many cat behaviorists have started their own line of work as independent cat trainers and behavior modifiers, including Jackson Galaxy and Sophia Yin. Jackson Galaxy has partnered up with Animal Planet and provides a show called My Cat from Hell, which identifies behavioral issues in cats and Sophia Yin created her own website to help individuals with problem cats. Mieshelle Nagelschneider, also known as The Cat Whisperer, is another very popular cat behaviorist and online consultant for cat owners. She is the author of the book, The Cat Whisperer (Random House Publishing), which has been featured in the New York Times. She has appeared on The Today Show, NBC Dateline, National Geographic, and Animal Planet. Other cat behaviorists have developed interest in veterinary jobs, animal control, animal shelters, kennels, and other animal-related work.  Salary  Since the employment opportunities for cat behaviorists differ, there is no set working salary. Those working for non-profit companies or researchers, such as zoos, typically earn less than those working for private companies. It also depends on the role of the job and where the behaviorist works. According to Michael Hutchins from the American Zoological Association, \\"Most animal behaviorists earn from $35,000 to $90,000 and more\\".

The organization aims to support local and tribal communities through education, social awareness, and agricultural science. Founded in 1953, as Gaurkheda Panchkroshi Rachnatmak Karyakari Sahakari Mandali, Satpuda Vikas Mandal has worked tirelessly over the past 60 years to bring education and technology into the region while maintaining customs and culture in the local communities it supports. History The Bombay government started a Sarvodaya Programme as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. This Programme included selection of 25-30 tribal and backward villages in every district. These villages were handed over to the volunteers who believed in the spirit of development according to Gandhian ideology. The part of Maharashtra known as East Khandesh (Jalgaon) was also covered under this programme. The late Dhanaji Nana Chaudhari The responsibility for the same was entrusted to noted freedom fighter and Gandhian Shri Dhanajinana Chaudhari. This responsibility was entrusted by the Chief Minister of the State Mr. Morarji Desai. Shri Dhanajinana Chaudhari selected 25 villages in the Satpuda range for development. Seeing the vastness of the work Mr. Madhukarrao Chaudhari and his 6 colleagues under took a socio- economic survey of these villages. Based upon the findings of the survey a plan was drawn up for the development work to be undertaken in the region. 1n 1949 the developmental work under Sarvodaya was started in this area. Through this Programme of Sarvodaya work was undertaken for People‚Äôs Awareness, Education, Road development, Water Supply, Health and other basic necessity required for leading a good life. Efforts were made to unite forest labourers. Cooperative Societies were opened at village level. This helped in extending financial help to the villagers. Due to these developmental interventions there was a lot of anguish among the contractors and the village moneylenders. On 29 December 1952 this anguish took a violent turn when some tribals were hired to assassinate Shri Dhanajinana Chaudhari. The two objectives of this assassination were firstly to stop all these developmental interventions and secondly to develop hatred towards the Tribal Community. This assassination of the patron and catalyst of development gave a great set back to all the social and developmental workers of the region. Keeping Gandhian ideology of not hating the sinner but the sin Mr. Madhukarrao Chaudhari and Bhausaheb Bonde again started this work for serving the people. The area was full with the thought that if one life was lost then the people would bring 10 such lives for sacrificing but the developmental work would not stop. In the year 1953 at the age of 24 Mr. Madhukarrao Chaudhari completed his M.Com and accepted the post of director of the Sarvodaya Scheme. He was also threatened to be killed but his strong determination for social cause made him bold enough to continue with his work. Although in all the villages some work was being carried out but Mr. Madhukarrao Chaudhari was worried about the future of these programmes. He was interested in making these programmes a part of the long- term developmental initiatives. There was risk that these programmes would stop as soon as the government aid for these programmes would be stopped. It was difficult and not wise to depend upon grant by the government to foster the Gandhian values and concept of development. Hence there was requirement to bring an element of self-reliance. He shared this concept with Bhausaheb Bonde, Khushalji Patil, Kashinath Bhagwan Firke, Hirasingh Pawar, Vajirbhai Tadvi, Abbasbhai Jamadar, Govinda Borole, Dhondubhau Patil, L. M. Pawar, Balirambhau and Mirabai Chaudhari. All these people accepted this idea and they pooled some money by their efforts and created a team of 20 people. This led to creation of an organisation named ‚ÄúGaurkheda Panchkroshi Rachnatmak Karyakari Sahakari Mandali‚Äù on 13 July 1953. After this idea was communicated to the local people, they accepted the idea and the concept. They even decided to give some grain as local contribution for running this project. The first year‚Äôs contribution in the form of money had been Rupees 2,750 /-. The first President of the organization was Prof. Janardhan Dhanu alias Bhanu Chaudhari. In 1954 this organization started an Ashram School at Pal. During this course from village Udali a person named Namdeo Goma Patil who was related to Madhukarraoji donated 10 Acres of his land at Pal to the organization. The first headmaster for the school was Shri P.G. Chaudhari. This Ashram School became a unit of development for the entire area. A Moral Education Center was also started at Pal. This provided education to the indigenous community. In 1969, the organization started D. N. Wandrekar Middle Ashram School. The first headmaster for the school was Shri R. D. Chaudhari. The students at Ashram School were given a regular education and also some knowledge about agriculture that brought labour and knowledge together. Primary Ashram Schools construction was done with the help of the government. Voluntary Shramdan2 done by the people helped in construction of middle schools. These people were teachers, students and students of government at Polytechnic College of Jalgaon. The then Governor of the State Hon. Dr. Ali Yawar Jung inaugurated this school building in 1972. In the year 1971 the organization was transformed in the form of a Public Trust that came to be known as ‚ÄòSatpuda Vikas Mandal‚Äô. The first Secretary of this organization was Shri Sunitbhai Bonde, who was an agriculture graduate and had a wide experience of working amongst tribals in Thane district of Maharashtra. Partnerships Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) is a front line agricultural extension center funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. KVK in Pal, Jalgaon District, is primarily funded and supported by Satpuda Vikas Mandal. The two organizations work in partnership to provide education, training, scientific testing and advice to local farmers and communities in order to improve crop yields and quality. CERES Global is a project of the not-for-profit CERES Community Environment Park, based in Melbourne, Victoria. There has been a long history of social, cultural and structural engagement between the two organizations. Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, through CERES Global, has formed a partnership with SVM and the communities in the Yawal Ranges. Since 2014, groups of Swinburne ICT students have been working with SVM to implement technologies throughout local schools and organizations in the area.

Barry was killed as he attempted to attack police officers with his machete. Four years prior to the incident, he had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for making radical statements. The attack was investigated as a possible instance of lone-wolf terrorism. In 2017, the White House said it was a terrorist attack. Attack Barry first entered the restaurant at about 5:20 p.m. and spoke to an employee. The nature of that conversation has not been revealed by investigators. However, NBC News reported that Barry asked the employee where the restaurant's owner was from. According to restaurant owner Hany Baransi, the employee told Barry that Barsani is from Israel. Barry left the restaurant afterwards and returned half an hour later, armed with a machete. Barry immediately swung his machete to attack Debbie and Gerald Russell, both 43, who were sitting in a booth near the front of the restaurant. He then moved on to the next table of people and then attacked Bill Foley, a musician performing at the restaurant and a friend of Baransi's. Neil McMeekin, at the 2nd table attacked, was able to get Barry off of Foley by hitting him with a chair. Shafi Ali, an immigrant from Dubai and an employee of Nazareth Restaurant, then drove Barry off with a metal baseball bat. Foley, the Russells, and Neil McMeekin all suffered injuries from the attack. About twenty people were inside the restaurant at the time of the attack. Barry fled the scene in a white Toyota Corolla and collided shortly thereafter with a Mercedes. The driver of the Mercedes called 9-1-1, explaining that he had just gotten into an accident, and that the other driver had a large knife. During the police pursuit, officers ran a routine search on the license plate number of the car Barry was driving; the search triggered an alert instructing the pursuing officers to contact the local terrorism task force. The officers tried to execute a PIT maneuver to force his Toyota off the road, but it was unsuccessful. A second PIT maneuver succeeded, and the vehicle crashed into a street curb. As officers approached the vehicle, Barry emerged and lunged at them with the machete and a filet knife, yelling \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" He was first tasered by officers, but when this did not stop him, they fired their guns. Barry was shot repeatedly and died of a bullet wound in his neck. Barry was 30 at the time of his death. A native of Guinea in West Africa, he had arrived in the U.S. in 2000. At the time of the attack, he was in the U.S. legally on a green card. He had worked in computer programming and information technology. FBI investigation Although he did not have any encounters with Columbus police, Barry was known to the FBI for making radical comments. The FBI has not released details of their investigation into him, which took place four years before the attack. Jeff Pegues, the homeland security correspondent for CBS News, reported that \\"law enforcement is concerned that this incident has the hallmarks of the type of so-called 'lone wolf' terrorist attack.\\" An investigation into the possibility of Berry being a self-radicalized Islamist terrorist was launched a week after the attack. As of May 10, 2016, authorities have not ruled out the possibility that Barry was a self-radicalized \\"lone wolf\\". Nazareth Restaurant Hany Baransi, the owner and manager of the popular restaurant on North Hamilton Road, describes himself as an Israeli Christian Arab who immigrated to America from Haifa, Israel. He has been operating Nazareth Restaurant in a local strip mall for 27 years. Nazareth is known for serving Middle Eastern dishes including shawarma, gyros, lamb kebabs, and stuffed grape leaves. An Israeli flag is on display inside his restaurant. The Washington Post described Barsani as a \\"popular local figure\\" and his restaurant as a \\"multicultural mingling place\\"; a painting of a Christian, a Jew, and a Muslim in amicable conversation hangs on the wall. Baransi believes that the attack was an act of terrorism because he is Israeli and added that there were a number of other restaurants in the strip mall that Barry could have chosen to attack. However, an FBI official stated that the investigation was still in its early stages and that it was too soon to jump to conclusions. Aftermath Columbus area musicians organized a benefit concert to raise funds for the victims. The restaurant was closed down in the immediate wake of the attack, with a partial reopening four days after the attack. Baransi expected the restaurant to be fully back to normal operation by February 19. The restaurant fully reopened at 11:00 a.m. on that day, but it was abruptly closed down again hours later, with a post on social media clarifying that the staff needed more time to recuperate. In the days immediately after the attack, Barsani announced his belief that his employees were in danger because of his Israeli background and the hatred he and his staff were subsequently subjected to. He also added that he loved the U.S., but felt it was no longer safe; that local and national officials had not offered support to him, the victims, and his employees and customers; and that he was disappointed the attack was not being recognized as an act of terrorism. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther told reporters that he hoped to persuade Barsani to stay in Columbus. The restaurant stayed open, although Barsani continued to assert that authorities in Columbus and the United States in general do not take the threat of terrorist sufficiently seriously. In November 2016, following a car ramming and stabbing attack at Ohio State University, Columbus Police Deputy Chief Michael Woods compared it to the restaurant attack committed by Barry as also a potential act of terrorism. In February 2017, the White House listed the machete attack as a terrorist attack.

No 64 The Southern Folklife Collection is an archival resource at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, dedicated to collecting, preserving and disseminating traditional and vernacular music, art, and culture related to the American South. The Southern Folklife Collection is located in UNC's Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library. History The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Folklore Program was one of the first graduate programs for Folklore in the United States. The early faculty included , Arthur Palmer Hudson, and Guy B. Johnson, all of whom donated materials that were ultimately placed in the SFC. In 1968, faculty members of the Folklore Program established the UNC Folklore Archives. The John Edwards Memorial Foundation was formed in California in 1962 as an archive and research center named for Australian record collector John Edwards. Following Edwards untimely death in 1960, his remarkable collection of American country music records, along with a wealth of correspondence and other research materials, was strengthened by additions from his American friends and colleagues, including Eugene Earle, Archie Green, D. K. Wilgus, Ken Griffis, Ed Kahn, and Norm Cohen. In 1983, UNC purchased the John Edwards Memorial Collection, and, in the fall of 1986, the UNC Folklore Archives and the JEMC were combined to form the Southern Folklife Collection. The SFC officially opened for research during the Sounds of the South conference at UNC in April 1989. Australian collector and discographer John Edwards Scope The Southern Folklife Collection is an archival resource for the study of American folk music and popular culture. Its holdings document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production. Centered around the John Edwards Memorial Collection, the SFC is rich in materials documenting the emergence of old- time, country-western, bluegrass, blues, folk, gospel, rock and roll, Cajun and zydeco musics. The SFC contains over 300,000 sound recordings, 3,000 video recordings and eight million feet of motion picture film as well as tens of thousands of photographs, song folios, posters, manuscripts, books, serials, research files and ephemera. Collections Notable collections held by the SFC include those of Apollo Records (1944), Broadside magazine, Guy and Candie Carawan, Eugene Earle, William R.

T. obliqua is one of many species apart of the genus, Tmesipteris, more commonly known as \\"hanging fork-ferns\\". Tmesipteris is one of two genera in the order Psilotales, the other genus being Psilotum. T. obliqua is endemic to eastern Australia.  Anatomy and biology  T. obliqua is a weeping, epiphytic fern ally that grows on trunks of tree ferns, such as Dicksonia antarctica and some rocky surfaces. Fronds of T. obliqua are unbranched and grow to 20-65cm in length. T. obliqua has a thick fleshy rhizome but no true roots. This rhizome is brittle and resents disturbance. The stems are usually without branches and smooth at the base, except for a single groove on the upper surface of the lower section of stem. Leaves are oblong in shape, sometimes broad as well, and are roughly 20-30mm in length, 4-8mm wide. Leaves are not crowded (c. 3 per cm), are asymmetrical at the base and apex truncate with a fine excurrent point. Leaves reduce in size towards apex of stem (younger parts of the plant are smaller). T. obliqua are non-flowering and spore forming. Sporangia are borne in pointed 2-chambered capsules at the base of specialise forked bracts, which are narrower and shorter than sterile leaves. It has been discovered that Tmesipteris obliqua has the largest known fern genome (1C = 150.61 pg). Its genome size was estimated by flow cytometry in comparison with the genome of Paris japonica (Melanthiaceae; 1C = 152.23 pg), the largest genome so far reported for any eukaryote. This discovery has shown a double in genome size compared to genome size values previously encountered in ferns.  Distribution and Habitat  Tmesipteris obliqua is an epiphyte commonly found growing on the trunks of tree-ferns, especially the soft tree-fern, Dicksonia antartica and occasionally shady, moist rock-faces. thumb This species is widespread and common from sea level up to 600m in communities of fern gullies, rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests. T. obliqua thrives in moist, shady, humid and rocky environments and soil tolerances include mossy logs, rock or soil amongst exposed roots. T. obliqua unique lifestyle allows for gr T. obliqua is most commonly found distributed along eastern Australia.  Cultivation  Due to its epiphytic nature, T. obliqua grows best in areas of high rainfall, large amounts of shade and some humidity in communities with rocky surfaces. These very specific growth requirements, plus the delicacy of the species, makes it extremely difficult for cultivation.

He is the brother of Bogdan Popoviƒá, also a well-known and equally influential literary critic and university professor. Biography Pavle Popoviƒá was born on 16 April 1868 at Belgrade where he was brought up and educated, until he graduated in 1889 from the Grandes √âcoles, as the university was then still called. After serving as an assistant schoolmaster, first at ≈†abac and then in Belgrade, he went to Geneva and Paris, from 1894 until 1896, as a postgraduate student of French literature. After the publication of his study of the \\"French moralists\\" in 1893 and a critical work on Vladika Petar II Petroviƒá- Njego≈° of Montenegro's famous poem The Mountain Wreath (Gorski Vjenac), in 1894, he was appointed as assistant professor in Serbian Literature at the university, his alma mater, in 1895. Four years later Pavle published a \\"Survey of Serbian Literature,\\" from its beginnings until modern times, and this was translated into Russian in 1913. During the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, Pavle served in the army as a sergeant, attached to the Serbian Armed Forces' General Headquarters. During the Great War, he was sent by the Government on special missions, first to Italy, then to France and finally to England, where he remained until the end of the war. While in London, he was in charge of all those Serbian schoolboys and undergraduates who, after the invasion of Serbia, were brought to England in the summer of 1916 through the generosity of the British people and the enterprise of the Serbian Relief Fund, founded by Lady Paget, the wife of Sir Ralph Paget. In his spare time, Pavle wrote a brief \\"Survey of Jugoslav Literature\\" which the Cambridge University Press published in Serbian in 1918. He also wrote a number of articles and pamphlets, literary and political, in English. On his return home in 1919, he was made Professor of Jugoslav Literature at the University of Belgrade (in 1905, Belgrade's Grandes √âcoles became the University of Belgrade) and soon afterwards he became one of the most successful Rectors, distinguishing himself in rebuilding the university and in particular its library, which the German bombardments had destroyed. He was a visiting professor at King's College London. Pavle Popoviƒá was also the secretary of the Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga (Serbian Literary Society) from 1911 to 1920, its vice-president from 1920 to 1928, and president from 1928 to 1937. Literary critic Pavle Popoviƒá was French-oriented, like his brother Bogdan. Pavle complimented Jovan Skerliƒá's work by publishing an overview of Serbian literature (1913) that emphasized early literary history and the oral tradition that followed. His method of literary history combined archival research, philosophical polemics, and comparative perspective, discourse, inspired by other contemporary European literatures, gave a touch of elegant and witty lightness to anecdotal narratives, and soon influenced a younger generation of critics and essayists. Pavle grew into an authoritarian figure in Serbian academia but was less present in public than his brother. His literary history and his numerous specialized studies on nineteenth-century Serbian theater and other matters were considered a standard for more than 60 years, along with Skerliƒá's work, which was, to be sure, ideologically more attractive. Pavle Popoviƒá corresponded with the following scholars Milivoy S. Stanoyevich, George Rapall Noyes, John Dyneley Prince, Robert William Seton- Watson, Watson Kirkconnell, and many other academics.

Early life Portrait of his mother, Lucy Tappan Bowen, by Francis Bicknell Carpenter, 1859, at the National Gallery of Art John Elliot Bowen was born on June 8, 1858 in Brooklyn, N. Y. He was the fifth of seven sons born to Henry Chandler Bowen (1813‚Äì1896) and Lucy Maria Tappan (1825‚Äì1863). He was a direct descendant, on his father's side, from the Apostle Eliot, whose name he bore. On his mother's side, he was a great-grand nephew of Benjamin Franklin. His elder brother was Clarence Winthrop Bowen (1852‚Äì1935). Bowen graduated from Yale College in 1881. Career On July 16, 1881, he sailed with his brother Herbert Wolcott Bowen (1856‚Äì1927) on the SS City of Chester for a year of travel in Europe, and other countries, including Egypt, going up the Nile into Nubia, Palestine, Syria and Constantinople. He then studied for a few months in Germany. After his return to America became a member of the editorial staff of The Independent, in special charge of its literary correspondence and enterprise. At the same time he pursued a course of study in political science in Columbia College, where he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1886, presenting a thesis on \\"The Conflict between the East and West in Egypt,\\" which was published afterwards. In 1888, he also published a volume of poetical translations of Carmen Sylva's Songs of Toil. In 1888, Bowen visited Washington, DC with his father, mother, sister Grace Aspinwall Bowen (1850‚Äì1940), his fianc√© Ethel, and cousin Fanny Lincoln to watch the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison as President of the United States. After the inauguration, there was a small informal reception at the White House that Bowen attended. Purportedly, the families of the Cabinet officers did not know each another and because Bowen did know most of them, he acted the part of introducer for the officers as well as for the President and his wife. Personal life On January 3, 1890, in his 32rd year of life, he died in Brooklyn, after six weeks' illness, of typhoid fever. His death was particularly sad, as the previous evening had been fixed as the date of his marriage to Ethel.

He was still a child when his father, Guigues III, died on the Fourth Crusade and he inherited Forez. His mother was Alix and his uncle, Renaud, archbishop of Lyon, acted as regent until he came of age in 1218.. Guigues's first wife was Mahaut, daughter of Guy II of Dampierre. In 1223, Guigues granted a communal charter to the town of Montbrison. On 16 April 1224, he returned the places of Saint- Rambert, Bonson, Chambles, Saint-Cyprien and Saint-Just to the monastery of √éle Barbe, declaring that they were allods held freely and that he and his predecessors had unjustly possessed them. In 1224, Guigues also founded a collegiate church of thirteen canons at Montbrison, dedicating it to the Virgin Mary. The foundation of Notre-Dame-d'Esp√©rance was confirmed by Archbishop Renaud in October 1224. The charter of foundation mandated that the canons be in residence for at least six months of the year. In 1226, Guigues married Matilda, daughter of Peter II of Courtenay, countess of Nevers and widow of Herv√© IV of Donzy. With the death of her son-in-law, Guy of Ch√¢tillon, at the siege of Avignon that same year, Guigues became count of Nevers.. In 1235, Guigues joined the Barons' Crusade. He came from an illustrious crusading family. His father had gone on the Fourth Crusade and his ancestor Count William III had joined the First Crusade. Likewise, his wife's family had crusaders in every generation going back to the Crusade of 1101. Guigues IV's primary motivation for crusading was to remove the sentence of excommunication that had been placed him for the alleged spoliation of monasteries and sheltering heretics.. Likewise, by taking the crusader vow Guigues received relief from interest payments on his large debts and extensions on repayment of principal.Lower (2005), p. 71. When the Barons' Crusade finally set out in 1239, Guigues left his counties under the government of Matilda in his absence. He and his retinue‚Äîat least a chaplain, William of Vichy; two squires; and a physician‚Äîwere part of the army of King Theobald I of Navarre. Theobald's county of Bar-sur-Seine bordered Guigues's county of Nevers and in the 1220s the two had a brief boundary dispute. Theobald left the Holy Land to return home in September 1240, Guigues and Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy stayed behind to construct a fortress at Ascalon.Lower (2005), p. 52. The poet Eustache le Peintre de Reims wrote a short song in Old French, Amours, coment porroie chancon faire, about Guigues's participation in the Crusade.. While in the Holy Land, Guigues received a relic of the True Cross from the Master of the Temple, Armand de P√©rigord.. He died at Castellaneta in Italy while returning from his crusade. His body was brought back to Forez and lies in the church he had founded at Montbrison.. In his will, Guigues names his two children: his successor, Guigues V, and his younger son, Renaud. He expressed the wish that Renaud would enter the church. He left the relic of the cross to his eldest son. He named as his executors Jean de Bernin, the archbishop of Vienne; Beatrice, the countess of Albon; the abbot of B√©nissons-Dieu; and the dean of Montbrison.

The bombs were loaded onto transport trucks from where they would be defused at the Al-Suwaira Multinational Division Central-South army base. At 12:05 a.m, the trucks reached the base and a Ukrainian back-up team from the 72nd separate mechanised brigade assisted the sappers in unloading the explosives from the transport vehicles. While this was happening an explosive rigged between two of the aerial bombs detonated itself, caused a mass explosion that killed 8 Ukrainian troops and a Kazakh sapper, while also wounding 10 others of varying degrees, including 6 Ukrainians and 4 Kazakhs. Among the dead was a 52nd Battalion Ukrainian lieutenant colonel. Following the incident, the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for the explosion. According to the Ukrainian contingent commander in Iraq, Major General Serhiy Popko, there were reports of men sitting in a car and surveying the troops unload the charges before the blast, and then quickly speeding away afterwards. This caused speculation as to whether the IED was triggered remotely. In reaction to the deaths, Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma called for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. This was the primary cause that led to the direct pullout of 1,650 Ukrainian troops in December 2005. The Kazakh mission pulled out in 2008, suffering its sole fatality.

The township seceded from the district council as a corporate municipality in 1868, only to re-amalgamate with the district just over a hundred years later, in 1969. Ultimately the hundred became part of the much larger District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys by amalgamation in 1997 with district councils to the south. Localities Apart from Clare itself, the following localities and towns of the Clare and Gilbert Valleys council area are situated inside (or largely inside) the bounds of the hundred: Armagh, Benbournie, Boconnoc Park, Emu Flat, Gillentown, Hill River (most part), Penwortham, Polish Hill River, Spring Farm, Sevenhill, Spring Gully and Stanley Flat (most part).

The stated objective of the organization is to \\"address and eradicate the practice of human rights abuses and impunity that empowers officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran to perpetrate widespread human rights violations against Iranian citizens, and to hold them accountable for their actions.\\"  Objectives and mission  While traditionally plethora of human rights organizations have concentrated on documenting human rights abuses, lobbying and monitoring human right situations; JFI's distinctive mission is human rights advocacy to promotes accountability and redress. Helping to counsel and empower survivors and the relatives of victims is an essential part of JFI's work. By documenting, researching, awareness raising, advocacy and litigation, JFI, endeavors to serve as a source of analysis and information on the human rights situation in Iran, as well as an active NGO advocate in the international arena.  Activities and projects  JFI's main areas of work include ethnic and religious minorities, LGBTIs, women, and those who are persecuted because of their political beliefs. To achieve its mission, JFI researches, documents, validates cases and uses various media outlets to enhance the situation of human rights. JFI seeks justice through international venues and institutions where local systems of justice and accountability are nonexistent or insufficient. = Litigation for human rights = In 2015, as a third party of interest, JFI intervened in the case of Mohammad Sarafraz and Hamid Reza Emadi two of the Islamic Republic (IRI) officials who had challenged their travel ban and asset freeze case before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). These sanctions were approved in March 2013 by the EU Commission due to their involvement in serious human rights violations. Both parties were found guilty of serious human rights violations by ECJ marking the first time that a European court held an IRI official accountable for their culpability in a torture related case. The court ruled that in their capacity as the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Broadcasting, IRIB, and its subsidiary Press TV, they were guilty of serious human rights abuses. JFI presented expert witnesses who testified about the fact-based study of JFI called: Cut, Take Press TV off the Air. As a result, the sanctions against these two human rights violators remained in place. Additionally, Islamic Republic media mouthpiece, Press TV, has also been taken off the air in several countries. JFI urged satellite companies and governments to take Press TV off the air, and sanction both the entity and the individuals who were responsible for human rights violations. Over the course of one year, Press TV was taken off the air by several satellite companies, such as Eutelsat, and in several countries, including Germany, Spain and the United States. = Human Rights Violators Database = Initiated by JFI, the Data Bank of human rights violators identifies perpetrators and collects evidence about their roles in gross human rights abuses. The specific aim of the program is to transform, redress and fight impunity in the Iranian legal systems where the judiciary is complicit with governmental transgression. Documenting organizations and individuals in violations of human rights is a JFI project which seeks to name and shame government officials who have been engaged in severe human rights violations. Through media coverage, direct sanctions and legal measures; JFI campaigns to shine the international spotlight on human rights violations of Islamic Republic of Iran officials. Many of those who were sanctioned by the European Union or the U.S. Treasury had been previously identified by Justice for Iran as human rights violators. Some of those individuals include Ali Ashraf, Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam, Rashidi Aghdam, Morteza Kiasati, Seyed Mohammad Bagher Mousavi, Seyed Reza Mousavi Tabar, Mohammad Sarafraz, Assadollah Jafari, Hamid Reza Emadi, and Abdolsamad Khoramabadi and organizations such as IRGC's Center to Investigate Organized Crime and Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Following advocacy campaigns by Iranian human rights activists, the Council of the European Union passed a regulation which allowed the EU to adopt restrictive measures, including travel ban and freezing of the assets, against those who were complicit in or responsible for directing or carrying out grave human rights violations. = Human Rights Defenders Program =  A Legal Aid Clinic  JFI has pioneered a web-based pro bono legal and psychological hotline program to aid and assist activists and prevent future state sponsored violence. This program called Dastgiri also provides prerequisite security measures for those in critical situations and in a proper time generates coverage in Persian and international media as required. One of the features of JFI's Dastgiri program provides a link between those in need of legal assistant and those who can provide such services pro bono publico in Iran. Experienced lawyers help activists who have sometimes done nothing but merely participated in marching and have been arrested. This is one of the only Iranian online hotline networks which provides counseling, criminal defense, training in movement support, and litigation to challenge the system enabling impunity. This program has helped a wide range of activists such as women's right defenders, ethnic minorities, LGBT rights activists, human rights lawyers, journalists and political activists. =U.N. Advocacy= JFI also attempts to raise public awareness through the United Nations and other international mechanisms. Although, Iran has not ratified many international conventions like The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) or the U.N. Convention against Torture, JFI has asserted the use of the remaining UN human rights mechanisms including United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures. JFI regularly has submitted alternative reports pursuant to U.N. Commissions and has participated in advocacy efforts alongside other international organizations such as FIDH, REDRESS and Amnesty International. In 2013, the U.N. Committee on International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in its Concluding Observations on Iran's implementation of the ICESCR adapted JFI's alternative report findings and expressed serious concern about a wide range of pressing substantive human rights abuses faced by women, children, Baha‚Äôis, workers and trade unionists, members of ethnic minorities including the Kurds, Ahwazi Arabs, Azeris, Baluchs and Afghans. refugees and migrants, and also members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In 2015, issues raised by JFI in its submission to United Nations Universal Periodic Review resulted in 50 recommendations to Iran which directly addressed the issue of early and forced marriages, as well as the rights of women and gay and transgender people. In October 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women identified, one of JFI research projects regarding sexual torture, called Crime and Impunity as a primary source that has uncovered the cases of female political prisoners rape in \\"Islamic Republic of Iran throughout the 1980s, including the rape of young virgin girls before execution, forced marriages and other forms of sexual violence, some of which continues to this day.\\" Based on information primarily provided by JFI alternative report in 2016, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) reprimanded the Islamic Republic of Iran's delegation for failing to carry out institutional reforms which prescribes the marriages of children as young as nine years old and marriages of parents with their own stepchildren. JFI's findings were adapted by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in the third and fourth periodic reports of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In mid-November 2018 United Nations‚Äô General Assembly's Human Rights Committee approved a resolution against Iranian government's continuous discrimination against women and limitation of freedom of thought. = Publications = According to JFI, along with its commitment to pursue Justice, JFI's founding principles includes active research on sociopolitical questions and a robust commitment to gather facts about the various human rights cases. JFI conducts fact-finding research to investigate human rights violations. Many of these reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to Human Right violations and pressuring authorities in question. Issues raised by Justice for Iran in its reports include religious, ethnic, social and gender discrimination, torture, use of underage children for marriage, Hijab, impunity of state sponsored crimes, political corruption, abuses in Iranian civil and criminal justice systems, and the legalization of homosexuality and LGBTI rights. Here is a selected list of research reports and publications of JFI research in English: # The Unfinished Tale; The mothers and families of Khavaran: 30 years pursuit of truth and Justice (to be published in 2016). # Diagnosing-Identities-Wounding-Bodies: Human Rights Violations against Lesbian, Gay and Transgender People in Iran by Raha Bahreini (2014) #Thirty-five Years of Forced Hijab: The Widespread and Systematic Violation of Women‚Äôs Right in Iran by Maryam Hosseinkhah (2014) #Women‚Äôs Reproductive and Domestic Labour at the Service of Nation-Building by Maryam Hosseinkhah and Ananymous (2014) #Stolen Lives, Empty Classroom: An Overview on Girl Marriage by Maryam Hosseinkhah (2013) #Raped out of Paradise: Women in Prisons of the Islamic Republic of Iran (2013) #Putting a Face to the Crime; Islamic Republic Figures Responsible for the Persecution of Bah√°‚Äô√≠s in Iran (2013) #Seeking Rights to Cultural Identity; The Deathly Struggle of Ahwazi Arab Activists (2013) #Crimes and Impunity: Sexual Torture of Women in Islamic Republic Prisons by Shadi Sadr and Shadi Amin (2012) #Iran: an Afghan Free Zone?!

Take Press TV off the Air(2012) #Stoning in Muslim Contexts: A Mapping Report(2012)  Awards and honors  = Bludgeon Award = Following an anti- women Iranian Supreme Court's decision in 2010, JFI nominated Ayatollah Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, as well as majority of the Iranian Supreme Court judges, for the International Bludgeon award. Bludgeon award is given by the Women's Link which seek to identify the best and worst judicial decisions that affect gender equality. Since based on this Supreme Court's decision, if a wife has disagreement with her husband and leaves him and the husband takes another wife without obtaining her permission, the first wife is considered to be disobedient and thereby cannot obtain a divorce. Ayatollah Eje‚Äôi won the International Bludgeon but did not attend the ceremony to receive his award. = Women‚Äôs Voices Now (WVN) Prize = In 2014, one of JFI's video production called Final Moment which is about the rape of virgin political prisoners prior to execution won the prize of the Women's Voices Now (WVN) Film Festival. It was also screened in Herat Women's International Film Festival where it was met with great enthusiasms and applause from the audience, especially Afghan women.

The works is based on the site of the Haverton Hill shipyard, initially operating as the Furness Shipbuilding Co. Ltd., established 1918. Shipbuilding at the yard ended in 1979. History Haverton Hill built HMS Erne (U03) in 1943 The Haverton Hill shipyard opened in 1917 under a wartime construction programme. Shipbuilding took place at the yard from 1919 to 1969 as the Furness Shipbuilding Company under the shipping group Furness Withy. In 1968 the yard was acquired by Swan Hunter who operated the yard for a further decade, and finally by Smith's Dock Co. Ltd who built three ships at the yard in 1978. Shipbuilding ceased in 1979. In 2008 the shipyard reopened under Tees Alliance Group (TAG) to construct the foundation structure of an oil rig 'SeaDragon 1', initially to be leased to Pemex (Mexico). In 2009 the contract between TAG and the rig development company (Sea Dragon Offshore) was terminated, with the financier (Lloyds TSB) citing financial risk, and the work transferred to a yard in Singapore with previous experience of rig construction.

By 1993, Ju had again decided to switch affiliations. Though he briefly considered joining the Kuomintang, he was named the New Party candidate for governor of Taiwan Province in August 1994. As a result, Ju consolidated the CSDP with the New Party on 28 December 1994.

It is attached to the Shukla Yajurveda, and classified as one of the Samanya Upanishads of Hinduism. The Subala Upanishad, together with the relatively older Mudgala Upanishad, are two Upanishads that discuss the Purusha Sukta of Rigveda, both notable for asserting that Narayana (Vishnu) is the Brahman (Highest Reality, Supreme Being). The Subala Upanishad text differs from Mudgala Upanishad in presenting more verses of the Purusha Sukta, being longer, and for declaring Narayana to be the father, the mother, the refuge, the friend and the goal of every living being. The text is notable as the one frequently referred to by Ramanuja, the 11th-century proponent of Vishishtadvaita (qualified monism) school of Vedanta philosophy and a major influence on Vaishnavism in the 2nd millennium CE. Some modern scholars suggest that the Narayana theology of the Subala Upanishad may have been the decisive impetus to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita philosophy. History The author or composition date of Subala Upanishad is unknown. Hans Hock states that it is a late Upanishadic text. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Subalopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 578‚Äì579 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 30. Contents The Subala Upanishad is structured into sixteen chapters and deals a range of topics, including cosmology, physiology, psychology, and metaphysics. =Cosmology= The text opens as a conversation between Vedic sage Raikva (Subala) and Prajapati, the former is credited in the Chandogya Upanishad for Samvargavidya. Raikva asks about the origin of universe, with the question \\"What was at first?\\" The answer that follows in the text mirrors the Nasadiya Sukta hymn 10.129 of the Rigveda. In both texts, Prajapati replies that there was neither Sat (Be-ness), nor Asat (not-Be- ness), nor Sat-asat (co-mingling of both Sat and Asat). This Vedic cosmogony asserts that the universe started from nothing, a state where neither spirit nor matter nor a mingling of either existed. The Subala Upanishad asserts that in this nothingness existed the absolute Para-brahman, from which darkness emerged. This account resonates with the verses of the Purusha Sukta hymn 10.90 of the Rigveda. The text states that from the darkness emerged ether (or space). In turn, air emerged from ether, fire emerged from air, water emerged from fire, and earth emerged from water. From earth emerged the egg, which split to create atmosphere and land. Between atmosphere and land emerged the divine person (Purusha) with one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand arms, and one thousand feet, who created death. The Brahman then created seven sons filled with truth, called Prajapatis. Out of the divine Purusha's mouth emerged the Brahmins, from the arms emerged the Kshatriyas, from the thighs emerged the Vaishyas and from the feet emerged the Shudras. From his mind emerged the moon, from the eyes came the sun, from his heart came the life-force (prana). Chapter 2 asserts that from the apana of the divine Purusha came the Yakshas, Rakshasas, domestic animals, and Gandharvas. From his bones emerged the mountains, while the herbs and trees came from his hair. His forehead and anger became Rudra, while his exhalation became the Vedas, the Sutras, the grammar, the Nyaya logic, the prosody, the dharma, and all human knowledge and all beings. Atma (soul) emerged as divine light absorbing everything in the universe. He divided his own self (Atman of Purusha) into two, thus creating woman and man. The text asserts that along with the cycle of creation is competing cycle of destruction, wherein Vaishvanara destroys and returns everything back to darkness, where there is \\"neither Sat, nor Asat, nor Sat-asat.\\" =Virtuous life as means to self- knowledge= Chapter 3 elaborates the path to moksha (liberation) through realization of the ultimate reality and being, the Atman and the Brahman. Atman and Brahman, asserts the text, is unborn, uncaused, devoid of form or nature that can be sensed; is imperishable, neither short nor long, neither definable nor obscure, neither provable nor shrouded, neither manifested nor measurable, neither with interior nor with exterior. One attains this Atman and self-knowledge through virtues, which are six in number ‚Äì truthfulness, charity, austerity, non-injury to others, Brahmacharya, and renunciation. The text then repeats the \\"da, da, da\\" axiology found in section 5.2Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, page 150 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, referring to dama (self-restraint), dƒÅna (charity) and daya (compassion). =States of consciousness= Chapter 4 states that the soul resides in the heart of a living being (dahara), in a ten petaled lotus. The heart feeds the 72,000 vessels in the body (nadis). The immortal soul, the innermost center of one's existence, is ever-present as the \\"resplendent effulgence\\", whether one is in an awake state of consciousness or dreaming in one's sleep. This section of the Subala Upanishad resonates with the doctrine presented in the much more ancient Chandogya Upanishad's section 8.1. =Organs in the human body are divine= Chapter 5 asserts, one by one, that 14 organs in the human body and ahamkara (personality) are divine. He who moves in these organs and binds them is the \\"fearless, sorrowless, infinite\\" Atman (soul, self). For example, states the text, the eye is the deity Surya and the source of knowledge, and is thus linked to the soul. The tongue and mouth are Varuna, the hands are Indra, the feet are Vishnu, the mind is Moon, ahamkara (personality) is Rudra, and the sexual organs are Prajapati. One must meditate on one's soul, states the text. This soul is the all-knowing ruler of all these organs and the source of happiness. The text asserts that soul is what is discussed by the Vedic texts and scriptures. =Narayana: the basis= Chapters 6 and 7 state that Narayana (Vishnu) is the one divine alone. The directional gods, all Devas, time and the aeons, the planetary systems, the climatic phenomena, the fourteen nadis, all organs of living beings, parents, siblings, fire, and ghee (clarified butter) are identified as manifestations of Narayana. Narayana is the radiant indwelling spirit in everyone and in every creature, asserts the text. =Dissolution= Chapter 8 through 12 state that everything except the Narayana (soul) is transitory and subject to dissolution. Everything merges back into the immortal, fearless, sorrowless, endless, seedless Brahman. Chapter 10 asserts that Atman is Brahman, and everything rests in one's own soul. =The life of the sage= Chapter 13 asserts that the child is a state of innocence and non-attachment, and this is what one must cultivate. The child knows of no classes or stages of life and learns innocently. So also, states the text, is the state of moksha (liberation) for a sage, who knows no fear, worries, cravings, anger, or falsehood. =Gradual dissolution in the supreme= Chapters 14 to 16 assert that with self-knowledge, a person dissolves into the supreme, the Narayana. In this state, there is \\"neither Sat, nor Asat, nor Sat-asat.\\" Impact The Subala Upanishad was frequently cited by the 11th-century scholar Ramanuja, the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita (qualified monism) school of Vedanta philosophy. His bhasya (commentary) on Brahma Sutras, for example, references the Subala Upanishad, as he interprets the Sutras. Ramanuja justifies Vishnu as each individual self (Atman, soul), the inner self of everyone, everything in the world, the means to ultimate liberation, with theological arguments partly based on the Subala Upanishad. Bartley states that the Narayana theology of the Subala Upanishad was an important influence on Ramanuja, while Oberhammer and Rastelli describe Subala Upanishad as possibly the decisive impetus to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita philosophy. According to John Plott, the Subala Upanishad influenced the Bhakti movement in medieval India.

He is son of Kashvad, father of Giv and Roham and the grandfather of Bizhan. His first appearance is in the time of Kay Kavus and thereafter he appears almost in every story of the heroic age, sometimes he is the spahbed of Iranian Army. His personality is described very positively with traits such as loyalty, patience and altruism.  In Shahnameh  Goudarz plays a vital role in the story of Kay Khosrow. Kay Khosrow is one of the greatest kings of Shahnameh and he is the son of Siavash and Farangis and the grandson of Kay Kavus. Kay Khosrow was born and grown up in Turan. One day the Soroush (angel) comes to Goudarz in his dream and tells him that the son of Siavash is in Turan and Iranians should go there and bring him back to Iran. He tells Goudarz that only his son, Giv, could do this job. Goudarz then sends Giv to Turan in search of Kay Khosrow and after seven years, Giv finally finds Kay Khosrow and brings him back to Iran. At this time, Goudarz is an old man. Goudarz is the one who kills Piran Veyse in the story of Davazdah Rokh. Unlike many other Iranian heroes who disappear in snow after Kay Khosrow's ascent, Goudarz survives this accident along with Rostam and ZƒÅl.  Historical Goudarz  It has been suggested that Goudarz in Shahnameh is actually Gotarzes II of Parthia. The only difference is that in Shahnameh, Goudarz is the father of Giv, but in history it is the opposite, the historical Gotarzes is son of a certain Giv (this is known from his coins).

The film documents Russia's fight against Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Inside Fighting Russia is produced by Stuart Legg, and narrated by Lorne Greene. The film's French version title is La Russie sous les armes.  Synopsis  In 1942, during the Second World War, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, led by Joseph Stalin faced a formidable foe in Nazi Germany. Hitler's armoured legions attacked without warning, penetrating deep into the Soviet Union but were met by a fierce resistance. From ordinary citizens to the military that had to withstand the enemy attacks, the indomitable spirit of Russia began to change the course of the war. With the Soviet Union now a major member of the Allied war effort, millions of Russians bolstered by their faith and courage, are thrown into the caldron of war. Factory workers, farmers in their fields, educators and students in their schools, doctors in their hospitals, all symbolized the country's utilization of its cooperative energy to fight fascism. Workers in Canada and Great Britain demonstrated their solidarity with their Russian allies with street rallies in Montreal and London. The vast resources of labor and materials were mobilized by the Communist leadership. Since the 1920s and 1930s, with great sacrifices made by the working class and peasants, the Soviet Union had been transformed through a series of Five-Year Plans, into the world's second greatest industrial power. Turning to war factories in Siberia, far from the front lines, workers turned out tanks and aircraft, the new weapons of a mechanized war. With Moscow almost in sight, the furious Soviet counterattacks slowed and then stopped the advancing Nazi forces. In the coming months, the Soviet military leaders planned to throw back the invading Nazi armada and regain lost territories.

They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959. Historian Malek Khouri, in analyzing Inside Fighting Russia and the role of propaganda in the NFB wartime documentaries, said. \\"During the early years of the NFB, its creative output was largely informed by the turbulent political and social climate the world was facing. World War II, Communism, unemployment, the role of labour unions, and working conditions were all subjects featured by the NFB during the period from 1939 to 1946\\".Khouri 2007, back cover.

She describes her faith as \\"Always full of questions about God, Tauring said the pastors at church 'would see me coming and run.' When she got antsy with all the formal, sometimes silent church prayer, her grandmother encouraged her to go outside in nature, and 'pray as loud as you want, talk to God like Jesus did.'...Tauring doesn't see Christianity and the practices of the pagans and heathens as inherently contradictory. She says she has 'a personal relationship' with Jesus, but not with any organized religion...'Just because something is pre-Christian doesn't mean it's anti-Christian,' she said. 'Jesus didn't invent compassion.

Historically, it is notable as a site for the mining of gypsum and since 1970, the majority of the land within the current extent of the locality is within the protected area called the Innes National Park. Description Inneston is located about west of the state capital of Adelaide. It occupies all of the land on the south western tip of Yorke Peninsula south west of a line running from Willyama Bay on the south coast of the peninsula near Marion Bay to Gym Beach on the west coast of the peninsula.DEWNR, 2014 The coastline extending from Willyama Bay to Cape Spencer consists of a number of bays such as Cable Bay and Stenhouse Bay with some prominent headlands such as Rhino Head and a line of cliffs between Cable Bay and Stenhouse Bay. From Cape Spencer to West Cape, an unbroken line of cliffs ranging in height between and with some sandy beaches at their feet make up the south west coast of Yorke Peninsula. From West Cape to Pondalowie Bay, the cliff line is of a relatively lower height. From the south end of Pondalowie Bay to Gym Beach, areas of sand dunes dominate the shoreline and the land immediately adjoining it with the exception of Royston Head and the cliff line extending eastward to Dolphin Beach. The land between the locality‚Äôs north-eastern boundary and the coastline is dominated in part by a network of saline lakes including lakes such as Inneston Lake, Marion Lake and Spider Lake.Department of Marine and Harbors, 1985, chart 23 The locality is serviced by a road connected to the western end of the Yorke Highway which passes through Marion Bay and then Stenhouse Bay and which follows the coastline as a sealed road passing Chinamans Hat Island, Cable Bay and the turn-offs to Cape Spencer, Ethel Beach, West Cape and Pondalowie Bay. The road concludes as a sealed road at the Pondalowie Bay and continues as an unsealed road, passing turn-offs to Dolphin Beach and Shell Beach, to terminate at Browns Beach in the north west. History =Agriculture= Land within Inneston was first used in 1847 by William Burrage to graze sheep near Cape Spencer. In 1851, land in the vicinity of Cape Spencer became available for leasing and by 1855, Burrage held two leases. Water for grazing was sourced from wells fed by ‚Äúnatural springs.‚Äù Wells were established at Pondalowie Bay and Browns Beach during the 1850s and allowed ‚Äúthe establishment of sheep stations at Cape Spencer, Carribie and Stone Hut in the 1860s.‚Äù Cropping was carried out within the locality with ‚Äúpoor yields due to the intense coastal environment and soil infertility.‚Äù After 1927, land under cultivation increased due to ‚Äúa better understanding of the importance of trace elements (mainly manganese).‚ÄùDEH, 2003, page 27 =Mining= Abandoned gypsum mining equipment View of buildings at the abandoned mining town The Bellco Chalk Factory Stenhouse Bay Jetty In 1889, the mining of gypsum began at Marion Lake by the Australian Gypsum and Whiting Company who developed infrastructure both at the lake and at the township of Marion Bay including a railway connecting both the mine and the town.DEH, 2003, page 28 In 1913, the mining of gypsum was commenced at Inneston Lake by the Permasite Company, a Victorian enterprise owned by Messrs. Bell, Stenhouse and Innes, and who developed infrastructure at both the lake and at a settlement on the coastline that would subsequently be named as Stenhouse Bay and including a railway connecting both sites. The development at Inneston Lake grew into a town known as Inneston and which by the early 1900s has a population of about 150 people and included facilities such as ‚Äúa public hall, butcher, baker, bank and post office.‚Äù Later developments included a plaster factory built in 1916, a chalk factory opened in 1922 and as of 1927, the town had ‚Äútennis court, cricket and other recreational facilities.‚Äù Development at Stenhouse Bay included the construction of a jetty for the loading of goods onto ships. The two mining operations were consolidated under the control of one company, the Waratah Gypsum Pty Ltd, at a time during the late 1920s or the 1930s. It is reported that of gypsum was extracted from sites at Marion, Inneston and Spider Lakes between the years 1905 and 1973. In 1970, mining continued on land not included in Innes National Park and is reported as ceasing sometime immediately prior to 2003. =National park= Land within what is now Inneston was declared under the South Australian National Parks Act 1966 as Innes National Park in 1970 to ‚Äúconserve important habitat for the western whipbird, the mallee fowl and to protect a number of heritage buildings at Inneston‚Äù (sic). The national park was enlarged during the years 1977, 1984 and 1993 in ‚Äúresponse to significant recreational use.‚ÄùDEH, 2003, page 5 Official naming Land in the locality was originally known as Cape Spencer. The mining settlement located at Inneston Lake and which was known as Inneston was officially proclaimed as a town in 1927. In 1999, boundaries were created for the ‚Äúlong established name.‚Äù In 2011, these boundaries were adjusted specifically to remove part of the locality and place it in the adjoining locality of Marion Bay to ‚Äúensure the whole of the residential area is located within Marion Bay.‚Äù The locality also includes the following places that are also gazetted under the South Australian Geographical Names Act 1991 - Pondalowie Bay and Stenhouse Bay.

History It was created in the 1860s when closer settlement came to the Mid-North, allowing grain farming by self-employed farmers. The government town of Hilltown was surveyed in September 1865. The first lots at Hilltown were sold by public auction in March 1866. Street names of the surveyed township honored pioneering pastoralists of the region such as John Harris Browne and Charles Brown Fisher. It was proposed to rename it Yakkalo in 1916 and Milne in 1926, but neither took effect. Subsequent public infrastructure, since closed, included a railway siding and primary school. The Spalding railway line passed the town in 1922, the station was named for the Hundred of Milne which is the cadastral division in which the town was established. It was named in 1860 after Sir William Milne, MP. The town was recorded as diminished in 1929. The local railway station had been opened under the name of Milne, but was altered to Hilltown in 1939. The railway closed in 1984. Hilltown Post Office opened on 2 January 1914 and closed on 4 April 1985.

Their music has been described as an intelligent and often melancholy mix of pop and electronic music intended for dance but outside the mainstream of electronic dance music. They describe their sound as \\"dance pop with a slightly melancholy feel to it\\". Biography and origins Benoit Simon was born and raised in Paris. From an early age, he showed an interest in the electronics, especially as they related to sound. As a youth, he created music on an Atari home computer with his childhood friend and made himself a Vocoder. He also played some guitar. Inspired by the emerging genre of French house, and by Daft Punk in particular, Simon began making electronic music in earnest in 1995. For his day job, he worked in voice recognition and speech synthesis, work that led him to move to Boston in 2002. Benjamin \\"Sergio\\" Myers is from the small town of Fairfield, Iowa, the son of a professor. As a youth, he played rock guitar, but never wrote music or joined a band. He attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate and then began working towards a PhD in Renaissance literature at Johns Hopkins. After a DJ friend introduced him to the electronic music scene in Berlin one summer, he was inspired to begin making electronic music. As his interests became increasingly focused on music, he quit graduate school to devote more time to it. Moving to Washington, D.C., he taught English at St. Albans School while continuing to focus on his music. During this time, he released several tracks on Wolf + Lamb Records under the name Sergio Giorgini, which he later referred to as \\"very sporadic, rudimentary things.\\" Myers and Simon met in May 2008 at the birthday party of a mutual friend in the D.C. neighborhood of Adams Morgan. By this time, Simon was living in D.C., still pursuing his interest in electronic music while working his day job. About eight months after meeting, the duo began making music together in Simon's studio. Within two months, they produced the tracks \\"Full Grown Man\\" and \\"What I've Lost\\", which were released on the What I've Lost EP in November 2009 to favorable reviews. What I've Lost was their first release under the name Benoit & Sergio. Further successful releases followed in the 2009‚Äì10 school year. In the summer of 2010, Myers quit his teaching job at St. Albans and moved to Berlin to work on music full- time. His decision was partly influenced by his increasing discomfort with leading a double life as a high school teacher by day and electronic music artist by night. Another factor in Myers's decision was his father's cancer diagnosis, which prompted him to examine his own life. \\"I thought that if I was still doing the same job in 30 years, I could be where my dad is,\\" he recalled, \\"and I'd always have this what-if feeling.\\" While Simon initially stayed in D.C., the two continued to collaborate on their music, preferring to meet up to work together in person. In 2011, the duo became well-established in the electronic music world following the January release of the hit track \\"Walk & Talk\\", which Myers described as \\"sort of a zeitgeist song.\\" They also received playtime on BBC Radio 1 as part of Seth Troxler‚Äôs mix on the show Essential Mix. Their success was recognized at the end of the year when they were named the iTunes Breakthrough Electronic Artists of the Year and one of Resident Advisor's Top 10 Live Acts of 2011. The duo continue to enjoy success in the electronic music scene. Style and influences Benoit & Sergio's music is often described as melancholy and intelligent. The duo have described their own sound as \\"dance pop with a slightly melancholy feel to it\\" (or more poetically as \\"Cadillac Caribbean dance pop under an autumnal sky\\" and \\"an alloy of copper and silk\\"). They have been noted for staying outside the mainstream of electronic music, maintaining an emphasis on lyrics and vocals and a pop sensibility. Benoit & Sergio generally do not consider themselves to be DJs, preferring to play live shows of mostly their own music. Benoit & Sergio cite a wide variety of influences from electronic artists such as Isol√©e, Thomas Melchior, and Ricardo Villalobos to rock musicians, including Talking Heads, Pavement, Roxy Music, and Paul Simon. The duo have described differences in their individual influences despite their shared musical taste, with Benoit being more influenced by disco and Sergio being more influenced by rock. These influences are unusual for electronic artists, and Sergio has described them as contributing to the difference between the duo's sound and mainstream electronic music.

He is the moving spirit behind the performance of Baroque music in a country, which eventually may lead to the discovery of Philippine Baroque music. He is the founder of the Las Pi√±as Boys Choir (1969) and of the International Bamboo Organ Festival, held every year since 1976 at the St. Joseph‚Äôs Church of Las Pi√±as City, Metro Manila, a former school director of St. Joseph's Academy until 1994. Early life and career Born in Hasselt (Belgium) on February 22, 1944, he is the 6th child of a family of nine. Since grade 3 he was a member of the boys' choir (Saviozangers) of the\\"St.Jozefscollege\\" in his hometown Hasselt (Belgium). Two of the former choir conductors, Leo Van Nevel and ADEM (November 2010) Liber Amicorum dedicated to Paul Schollaert 70 with a contribution by Leo Renier (p.31-32) who later played a major role in the choir life of Flandres, have influenced his involvement in music for the rest of his life. During his high school days (1952‚Äì61), he took up organ (with Albert van den Born,Tongerse annalen 4 jg nr.4 (1990) p.38 : Albert van den Born, een groot Tongenaar (1915-1980) organist at the Basilica of Our Lady in Tongeren, Belgium) and music history (with Camille Swinnen, musicologist and founder of the ‚ÄúBasilica Concerten‚Äù) at the Municipal Conservatory in Hasselt. He joined the Mission Congregation of Scheut (CICM) in 1962. During his formation years, he was in charge of the Schola (Gregorian chant) and the liturgical music. When studying in Louvain (1964‚Äì68), he was a member of the team which spearheaded the renewal of liturgical music at the University Parish in line with the new directions of the Second Vatican Council. During that same period, he took up private lessons in harmony with . Las Pi√±as Boys Choir He arrived in the Philippines in February 1969 and attended a language course before being assigned to the Parish of St.Joseph in Las Pi√±as, home of the Bamboo Organ. He stayed there as assistant parish priest and director of the parochial school until 1994. Soon after his arrival, he formed the \\"Himig Kawayan Boys Choir\\", which had their first public appearance during the Midnight Mass of Christmas of the same year. Three years later, the choir participated in the First National Children's Choir Competition, organized at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, where they ended with a third prize. Because of the many engagements that followed, Leo Renier contacted Engracio Tempongko, who had been the assistant of Fr.John Van de Steen CICM, conductor of the then famous Manila Cathedral Choir during the 60‚Äôs. The name of the choir was changed into the ‚ÄúLas Pi√±as Boys Choir‚Äù. And when they participated in the Third National Children‚Äôs Choir Competition in 1975, the choir ended first. History has proven that the choir has become the place to provide the musicians the Bamboo Organ needs to safeguard its future. Several of the alumni have taken up a career in music, among them the present conductor of the choir, Armando Salarza, and the organ builder Cealwyn Tagle. The Restoration of the Bamboo Organ and the yearly Festival Leo Renier, together with his colleague Fr. Mark Lesage, spearheaded the restoration of the Bamboo Organ done by Johannes Klais Orgelbau in Bonn, Germany (1973‚Äì75). While the organ was in Bonn, he undertook a study trip to Graus and Roda de Is√°bena in Spain, in search for the background of Fr. Diego Cera,Samson-Lauterwald, Helen The Bamboo Organ of Las Pi√±as ‚Äì Second Edition The BambooOrgan Foundation (2006) p.22-58&http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/37921/1/Ezquerro-1998-Resenya- Salamero%20Reymundo.Ensayo%20bi the builder of the Bamboo Organ. After the organ was flown back to the Philippines by SABENA Belgian World Airlines (free of charge), he initiated the International Bamboo Organ Festival and became its first artistic director (1976‚Äì94). The Festival received its much-needed support from the Cultural Center of the Philippines and their president Dr.Lucresia R.Kasilag, the various embassies, and the private sector so that soon the Festival firmly established itself as part of the cultural life of Metro Manila. Training of Filipino organists But the restoration of the Bamboo Organ would not be complete without training local organists. In cooperation with the Goethe Institut Manila, he organized for 3 consecutive years (1976‚Äì78) a workshop for organists, conducted by in order to develop an organ school where young boys and girls would be trained to play the Bamboo Organ. Among the participants was the music and piano teacher of St.Joseph‚Äôs Academy, Donna Ofrasio, who soon became the resident organist, teacher of the Bamboo Organ and wife of the then priest, Leo Renier. Some 40 local students were trained under her tutelage between 1977 and 1994. In 1979, Leo Renier became director of the St.Joseph‚Äôs Academy (SJA) of Las Pi√±as . Under his administration, a Technical School was built with the help of the Belgian Government, offering courses in auto mechanics, electronics, electricity, and metal to the 3rd and 4th year students of SJA. He was also assigned as National Director of Chiro Philippines (1978-1992). He resumed his position as conductor of the Las Pi√±as Boys Choir and expanded the choir by letting the previous members after the mutation of their voices join as tenors and basses. The yearly Festival now became the venue where the boys were exposed to the great choral works by J.S.Bach, Mozart and, Haydn, with Miles Morgan as Festival conductor from 1982 to 2000. At the same time, the resident organist was exposed to the teaching methods of the visiting organist (among them Peter Hurfort, Luigi F.Tagliavini, Guy Bovet, Stanislas Deriemaeker, Hans and Martin Haselb√∂ck). Results followed soon. In 1982, a long-term cooperation was established with the Institute for Churchmusic in Graz, and their director Dr.Johann Trummer, providing scholarships for young talents from Las Pi√±as, selected from among the members of the Las Pi√±as Boys Choir and the piano/organ department of SJA. Among them were Armando Salarza, Gerardo Fajardo and Bernabe Palabay as organ scholars; Cealwyn Tagle and Edgar Montiano (1969-2002) as organ builders. This development had been without any doubt the result of the restoration of the Bamboo Organ, which from long before it was granted the title, behaved like a real \\"National Treasure\\": for the benefit of the national musical heritage. The 300 years old Philippine organ tradition In October 1977, Hans Gerd Klais has undertaken a study trip to the islands of Cebu and Bohol and requested Leo Renier to accompany him. It was the beginning of the making of an inventory of the few historical Spanish organs the Philippines possessed: these instruments were completely forgotten and in most cases abandoned. The following organs were visited: Argao in Cebu (still playable), and Loboc, Baclayon, Loay, Maribojoc and Antiquera in Bohol. Klais published an article about his findings with technical descriptions and drawings in ‚ÄúActa OrganologicaKlais, Hans Gerd Philippinische Orgeln aus dem 18.und 19.Jahrhundert Acta Organologica (1979) Band 13 p.75-123‚Äù. It was obvious that these instruments were endangered, as was already the case in Antiquera with only a few pipes and the windchest stored in the church tower. But a restoration like the one undertaken for the Bamboo Organ would be too costly and unaffordable. The only solution would be the transfer of technology, by having a Filipino organ builder. A Philippine organ builder In 1988, Cealwyn Tagle was sent to Austria to work as an apprentice at the workshop of organ builder Helmut Allgauer in Gr√ºnbach am Schneeberg. Being a family enterprise, his exposure involved all aspects of the crafts starting with the selection of the woods, the making of the technical drawings and ending with the voicing of the organ. He was joined two years later by Edgar Montiano (+2002). In 1992, they moved to Klais Orgelbau in Bonn each for their own specialization, to become part of the team which would build the Klais organ in the EDSA Shrine in Manila. If the Las Pi√±as Bamboo Organ would always be in need of a good organist, there would also be a need in the future for a second pipe organ to play the music that was not playable at the Bamboo Organ. Funds were gathered for the construction of a practice organ in Las Pi√±as to be ready by the time Armando Salarza would return to Las Pi√±as after finishing his studies in Austria (1992). As a first step, in 1989 Renier had a new wing constructed (the Centennial Building) on the school grounds of SJA, with a new library, 10 classrooms, and an auditorium which would eventually house the practice organ. This ‚ÄúAuditorium Organ‚Äù would also become a final thesis for the two Filipino apprentices to prove their skill as organ builders. The organ was inaugurated on February 21, 1994. In the same year, Renier assisted in the establishment of the ‚ÄúDiego Cera Organ Builders‚Äù (DCOB) who put up their workshop in Talon (Las Pi√±as) to become a self-sustaining enterprise. He negotiated with Fr.Pedro G.Galende OSA the restoration of the organ of San Agustin in Intramuros, which would become the first historical organ in the country to be restored by the DCOB (completed in 1998). It appeared now that all these muted instruments soon would be able to speak again. Social engagement, educator and editor After having served Las Pi√±as for 25 years, Leo Renier became an NGO-worker, and founded the ‚ÄúCenter for Small Entrepreneurs‚Äù (CSE) with their offices in the Asian Social Institute (ASI). He left priesthood and married Donna Ofrasio, a music teacher in the parochial school which he served as director until 1994, and moved to Silang, where he engaged in hog farming for 10 years. But his expertise and care for the Philippine organ patrimony never left him. He was a consultant for church music at the Manila Cathedral Basilica, Intramuros, Manila (2006-2009). He engaged in teaching church music at the Maryhill School of Theology (SY 2007-2009) and was invited as a resource person on liturgical music for the First Liturgical Music Congress held in San Beda College, Mendiola, Manila ( October 29‚Äì30, 2013) and for the 9th Biennial National Convention of Church Cultural Heritage practitioners in Sorsogon (1 ‚Äì 4 June 2015). He organized the yearly Summer Course for Church musicians in Las Pi√±as since 2012. He was also a contributor to the Geschichte der Kirchenmusik published by Laaber Verlaghttp://www.laaber-verlag.de Band 4: Musik in jungen Kirchen p.271-276 (2014). Since 2009, he became again a member of the program committee of the International Bamboo Organ Festival, became a trustee of the Bamboo Organ Foundation in 2013 and was appointed as Executive Director of the International Bamboo Organ Festival. Renier took the initiative to have the liturgical repertoire of Nic Sengson performed during the 37th (‚ÄúAwitan Kristo‚Äù) and 40th (‚ÄúExodus‚Äù) International Bamboo Organ Festival. To make organ music available for Filipino organists, Renier made use of the computer programs so that decent scores of otherwise unavailable music for a divided keyboard (one of the characteristics of the colonial organs) would be within the reach of student organists. Without these ready-for-use scores available, Filipino organ students would not be able to demonstrate the real personality of the Spanish organs. At the same time, to combat the wrong practices of organists who were adjusting to the electronic organ and were using the entertaining style fitted to these instruments, he made organ accompaniments available for some 150 popular hymns.

The Historical organs of the Philippines The Diocese of Bohol with its magnificent baroque churches is the keeper of seven out of 17 historical organs (Baclayon, Dimiao, Garcia Hernandez, Loay, Loboc, Loon and Maribojoc) . The Boholanos developed over the years a very strong awareness of their cultural heritage. They have a professionally trained curator in charge: Fr.Milan Ted D.Torralba. Having now an organ builder in the country, they were the first to take advantage of the situation and engaged in the restoration of the organs in Loay (1999), Loboc (2003) and Baclayon (2008). With the number of playable instruments steadily increasing, the possibility was discussed with Guy Bovet when performing for the 7th time at the International Bamboo Organ Festival in 2010, to make the existence of an Iberian organ tradition in the Philippines known to the rest of the world by means of a recording. His acquaintance with the Spanish organ tradition and its literature and his equal familiarity with the Philippines made him the ideal person to be entrusted with a project featuring the character of each of the six instruments. Sound engineer was Claude Mar√©chaux. Both had to work in sometimes extremely difficult circumstances to get a quiet environment, even at night. Together with the 4 CD‚Äôs, a booklet was produced containing a first written history of the pipe organs in the Philippines. The launching of the CD‚Äôs took place on 17 November 2011 in the church of San Agustin in Intramuros, and so the name ‚ÄúThe Historical Organs of the Philippines‚Äù had been coined. The Bamboo Organ stopped being a single curiosity: it now became part of a cultural history which sadly had been forgotten. On August 5, 2011, King Albert II of Belgium had conferred on Renier the Knighthood in the Order of the Crown for his cultural and social contributions to the Philippines The Bohol earthquake (October 15, 2013) However, the same problem as the one that had plagued Las Pi√±as soon became obvious in Bohol: without organists, the money spent for the restoration of these instruments would be a waste. Leo Renier discussed this problem with Usec. Daniel Corpuz of the Department of Tourism. A budget of Php.200,000 was soon approved by the DOT. The 2 days long monthly workshop was conducted by Mrs. Donna O.Renier for advanced piano students between November 2012 and October 2013. The training program came to an abrupt end with the earthquake of October 15, 2013. The 3 restored organs (Baclayon, Loay and Loboc) only experienced minor damages: the Filipino restorer, Cealwyn Tagle, had glued the joints together as an additional security, being aware that an eventual earthquake would have shaken the organ case so that the entire organ would have fallen apart. The organ of Loboc was the only one in continuous danger since it was leaning forward hooked into a wall with cracks. Two more organs in Loon and Maribojoc (not yet restored) were completely buried under the rubble of a totally destroyed church. Only one month earlier, Leo Renier had submitted a petition (including an inventory) to the National Museum, to have all 17 Historical Organs of the Philippines declared National Cultural Treasures. This request had been endorsed on September 12, 2013, by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and on September 27, 2013, by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP). Fortunately, that so much awareness around the pipe organs had been built up during the previous years, if not they would have disappeared into complete oblivion, as what had happened during previous centuries with so many Filipino pipe organs hit by an earthquake. Leo Renier was requested by the NHCP to make an assessment of the five organs in Bohol, and to participate at the Expert‚Äôs Conference held on 17‚Äì20 November 2014 in Cebu and Tagbilaran. While waiting for the rehabilitation or reconstruction of the churches, the three organs of Loboc, Loay and Baclayon have been dismantled (2014‚Äì15) and kept in bodegas; in Loon and Maribojoc, all organ parts have been carefully recovered together with all other artworks. In 2014, Leo Renier negotiated with the Department of Tourism the initial funding of the restoration of the 3 remaining Spanish organs in Cebu: Argao, Dalaguete and Boljoon. The first two have been dismantled (Sept.1-10, 2015) and were transported to the workshop of the Diego Cera Organ Builders. With the help of Prof.Guido Dedene and Cealwyn Tagle, he opened a website ‚ÄúOrganographia Philipiniana‚Äù with a complete inventory of all the pipe organs in the Philippines, to bring the country back on the map of Iberian Organ tradition (together with Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Latin America).http://countries.diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/binaries/Newsletter_19_tcm425-259779.pdf References Category:Belgian organists Category:Male organists Category:Belgian expatriates in the Philippines Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century organists Category:21st-century male musicians ","title":"Leo Renier"},{"id":"49445960","text":"Oh Hyun-Mi (born ) is a South Korean female volleyball player.

He won a Pulitzer Prize twice, for The Consul (1950) and for The Saint of Bleecker Street (1955). He founded the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of the Two Worlds) in Spoleto in 1958 and its American counterpart, Spoleto Festival USA, in 1977. In 1986 he commenced a Melbourne Spoleto Festival in Australia, but he withdrew after three years. Menotti died on February 1, 2007, at the age of 95 in a hospital in Monte Carlo, Monaco, where he had a home. He was buried in East Lothian, Scotland. Early life and education Born in Cadegliano-Viconago, Italy, near Lake Maggiore and the Swiss border, Menotti was the sixth of eight children of Alfonso and Ines Menotti,Time, February 1, 2007 his father being a coffee merchant. Menotti began writing songs when he was seven years old, and at eleven wrote both the libretto and music for his first opera, The Death of Pierrot. He began his formal musical training at the Milan Conservatory in 1923. Following her husband's death, Ines Menotti went to Colombia in a futile attempt to salvage the family's coffee business. She took Gian Carlo with her, and in 1928 she enrolled him at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, but she returned to Italy. Armed with a letter of introduction from the wife of Arturo Toscanini, Gian Carlo studied composition at Curtis under Rosario Scalero.Gian Carlo Menotti Fellow students at Curtis included Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber. Barber became Menotti's partner in life and in work, with Menotti crafting the libretto for Barber's most famous opera, Vanessa, which premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1958. As a student, Menotti spent much of his time with the Barber family in West Chester, Pennsylvania. After graduation, the two men bought a house together in Mount Kisco, New York, which they named \\"Capricorn\\" and shared for over forty years.

While there, he jokingly referred to himself as \\"Mr McNotti\\". Career as composer Gian Carlo Menotti, photographed by Carl Van Vechten in 1944 It was at Curtis that Menotti wrote his first mature opera, Amelia Goes to the Ball (Amelia al Ballo), to his own Italian text. The Island God (which he suppressed, though its libretto was printed by the Metropolitan Opera and can be found in many libraries) and The Last Savage were the only other operas he wrote in Italian, the rest being in English. Like Wagner, he wrote the libretti of all his operas. His most successful works were composed in the 1940s and 1950s. Menotti also taught at the Curtis Institute of Music. Music critic Joel Honig served as his personal secretary during the late 1950s. Menotti wrote the libretti for two of Samuel Barber's operas, Vanessa and A Hand of Bridge, as well as revising the libretto for Antony and Cleopatra. Amelia al Ballo is the only one of Menotti's operas still to be published in its original or perhaps \\"complementary\\" Italian libretto (alongside the English) (see Ricordi editions 1937, 1976 and recent): it is an example of the traditional romantic Italianate style, with a nod to (but not an imitation of) Puccini and, notably, Mascagni (whose final opera, Nerone, had premiered in 1935). The success of Amelia prompted NBC to commission an opera specifically for radio, The Old Maid and the Thief, one of the first such works. Following this, he wrote a ballet, Sebastian (1944), and a piano concerto (1945) before returning to opera with The Medium and The Telephone, or L'Amour √† trois. His first full-length opera, The Consul, which premiered in 1950, won both the Pulitzer Prize for Music and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Musical Play of the Year (the latter in 1954). American soprano Patricia Neway starred as the tormented protagonist Magda Sorel, for which she won the Donaldson Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1950. Menotti apparently intended to give a role to a then-unknown Maria Callas, but the producer would not have it.Gruen, pp. ?? In 1951, Menotti wrote his Christmas opera Amahl and the Night Visitors for NBC. It was the first opera ever written for television in America,\\"Gian Carlo Menotti\\" (Obituary) in The Daily Telegraph (London), February 2, 2007. Retrieved March 28, 2007 and first aired on Christmas Eve, 1951. The opera was such a success that the broadcasting of Amahl and the Night Visitors became an annual Christmas tradition. It remains Menotti's most popular work to this day. Menotti won a second Pulitzer Prize for his opera The Saint of Bleecker Street in 1955. With Goya, Menotti reverted to a traditional Giovane Scuola Italian style. Menotti also wrote several ballets and numerous choral works. Notable among these is his cantata The Death of the Bishop of Brindisi, written in 1963, and the cantata Landscapes and Remembrances in 1976 ‚Äì a descriptive work of Menotti's memories of America written for the United States Bicentennial. Also worthy of note is a small Mass commissioned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore ‚Äì Mass for the Contemporary English Liturgy. He also wrote a violin concerto, symphonies, and a stage play, The Leper. It was in the field of opera, however, that he made his most notable contributions to American cultural life. =List of Menotti's operas= http://usopera.com/composers/menotti.html * Amelia Goes to the Ball (Amelia al ballo) (1937) * The Old Maid and the Thief, radio opera (1939) * The Island God (1942) * Sebastian (1944) ballet * The Medium (1946) * The Telephone, or L'Amour √† trois (1947) * The Consul (1950) * Amahl and the Night Visitors, television opera (1951), with Chet Allen in the title role * The Saint of Bleecker Street (1954) * The Unicorn, the Gorgon, and the Manticore (1956) * Maria Golovin (1958) * Labyrinth, television opera (1963) * The Last Savage (1963) * Martin's Lie (1964) * Help, Help, the Globolinks!

For three weeks each summer, Spoleto is visited by nearly a half-million people. These festivals were intended to bring opera to a popular audience and helped launch the careers of such artists as singer Shirley Verrett and choreographers Paul Taylor and Twyla Tharp.Time (Milestones section), February 19, 2007 In June and July 2007 the Festival of Two Worlds, which Menotti founded and oversaw until his death, dedicated the 50th Anniversary of the Festival to his memory, organised by his son Francis. Menotti works performed during the festival included Maria Golovin, Landscapes and Remembrances, Missa O Pulchritudo, and The Unicorn, the Gorgon, and the Manticore. Spoleto in Melbourne He left Spoleto USA in 1993 to take the helm of the Rome Opera, and in 1986, he extended the concept to a Spoleto Festival in Melbourne, Australia. Menotti was the artistic director during the period of 1986‚Äì88, but after three festivals there, he decided to withdraw ‚Äì and took the naming rights with him. However, while he was in Melbourne, he put the finishing touches to his opera Goya. The Melbourne Spoleto Festival has now become the Melbourne International Arts Festival.Bernard Holland, \\"Lyrical master of libretto and Spoleto\\",(obituary), The Age, February 3, 2007 Honors In 1984 Menotti was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor for achievement in the arts, and in 1991 he was chosen Musical America's \\"Musician of the Year\\". In addition to composing operas to his own texts, on his chosen subject matter, Menotti directed most productions of his work. In 1997, he was awarded the Brock Commission from the American Choral Directors Association., Retrieved March 2016 In 2010, the main theatre in Spoleto was renamed as the Teatro Nuovo Gian Carlo Menotti to honour his role as creator and spirit of the festival.Theatre profile on MySpoleto.

These wars, alongside the larger Russo-Ottoman War (1877‚Äì78) ended in defeat and substantial territorial losses for the Ottoman Empire which was formalised at the Congress of Berlin. This expulsion was part of the wider persecution of Muslims in the Balkans during the geopolitical and territorial decline of the Ottoman Empire. On the eve of conflict between Montenegro and the Ottomans (1876‚Äì1878), a substantial Albanian population resided in the Sanjak of ƒ∞≈ükodra. In the Montenegrin- Ottoman war that ensued, strong resistance in the towns of Podgorica and Spu≈æ toward Montenegrin forces was followed by the expulsion of their Albanian and Slavic Muslim populations who resettled in Shkod√´r. On the eve of conflict between Serbia and the Ottomans (1876‚Äì1878), a substantial, at times compact and mainly rural Albanian population alongside some urban Turks (some of Albanian heritage) lived with Serbs within the Sanjak of Ni≈ü. Throughout the course of the war, the Albanian population depending on the area reacted differently to incoming Serbian forces by either offering resistance or fleeing toward nearby mountains and Ottoman Kosovo. Although most of these Albanians were expelled by Serbian forces, a small presence was allowed to remain in the Jablanica valley where their descendants live today. Serbs from Lab moved to Serbia during and after the first round of hostilities in 1876, while incoming Albanian refugees thereafter 1878 repopulated their villages. Albanian refugees also settled alongside the north-eastern Ottoman-Serbian border, in urban areas and in over 30 settlements located in central and south-eastern Kosovo. Ottoman authorities had difficulties accommodating to the needs of the refugees and they were hostile to the local Serbian population committing revenge attacks. The expulsion of the Albanian population from these regions was done in a manner that today could be classed as ethnic cleansing as the victims were not only combatants, but civilians. These Albanian refugees and their descendant populations became known in Albanian as Muhaxhir; plural: Muhaxhir√´, a generic word for Muslim refugees (borrowed from Ottoman Turkish: Muhacir and derived from Arabic: Muhajir). The events of this period generated the emergence of the Serbian-Albanian conflict and tense relations between both peoples.  Sanjak of ƒ∞≈ükodra  On the eve of conflict between Montenegro and the Ottomans (1876‚Äì1878), a substantial Albanian population resided in the Sanjak of ƒ∞≈ükodra. In the Montenegrin- Ottoman war, the Montenegrin army managed to capture certain areas and settlements along the border, while encountering strong resistance from Albanians in Ulcinj, and a combined Albanian-Ottoman force in the Podgorica- Spu≈æ and Gusinje-Plav regions.. \\"Meanwhile Austria-Hungary's occupation of Bosnia-Hercegovina, which had been conceded at the congress, acted as a block to Montenegrins territorial ambitions in Hercegovina, whose Orthodox Slav inhabitants were culturally close to the Montenegrins. Instead Montenegro was able to expand only to the south and east into lands populated largely by Albanians ‚Äì both Muslims and Catholics ‚Äì and Slav Muslims. Along the coast in the vicinity of Ulcinj the almost exclusively Albanian population was largely Muslim. The areas to the south and east of Podgorica were inhabited by Albanians from the predominantly Catholic tribes, while further to the east there were also concentrations of Slav Muslims. Podgorica itself had long been an Ottoman trading centre with a partly Turkish, but largely Slav Muslim and Albanian population. To incorporate such a population was to dilute the number of Montenegrins, whose first loyalties lay with the Montenegrin state and Petroviƒá dynasty, not that this was seen as sufficient reason for the Montenegrins to desist from seeking to obtain further territory.\\"; p.23 \\"It was only in 1880 after further fighting with local Albanians that the Montenegrins gained an additional 45 km, stretch of seaboard extending from just north of Bar- down to Ulcinj. But even after the Congress of Berlin and these later adjustments, certain parts of the Montenegrin frontier continued to be disputed by Albanian tribes which were strongly opposed to rule by Montenegro. Raiding and feuding took place along the whole length of the porous Montenegrin-Albanian border.\\" As such, Montenegro's territorial gains were much smaller. Some Slavic Muslims and the Albanian population who lived near the then southern border were expelled from the towns of Podgorica and Spu≈æ.. \\"What one sees over the course of the first ten years after Berlin was a gradual process of Montenegrin (Slav) expansion into areas that were still exclusively populated by Albanian-speakers. In many ways, some of these affected communities represented extensions of those in the Malisor√´ as they traded with one another throughout the year and even inter-married. Cetinje, eager to sustain some sense of territorial and cultural continuity, began to monitor these territories more closely, impose customs officials in the villages, and garrison troops along the frontiers. This was possible because, by the late 1880s, Cetinje had received large numbers of migrant Slavs from Austrian-occupied Herzegovina, helping to shift the balance of local power in Cetinje's favor. As more migrants arrived, what had been a quiet boundary region for the first few years, became the center of colonization and forced expulsion.\\" ; p.254. footnote 38. \\"It must be noted that, throughout the second half of 1878 and the first two months of 1879, the majority of Albanian-speaking residents of Shpuza and Podgoritza, also ceded to Montenegro by Berlin, were resisting en masse. The result of the transfer of Podgoritza (and Antivari on the coast) was a flood of refugees. See, for instance, AQSH E143.D.1054.f.1 for a letter (dated 12 May 1879) to Dervish Pasha, military commander in I≈ükodra, detailing the flight of Muslims and Catholics from Podgoritza.\\" These populations resettled in Shkod√´r city and its environs. A smaller Albanian population formed of the wealthy elite voluntarily left and resettled in Shkod√´r after Ulcinj's incorporation into Montenegro in 1880.. \\"As noted above, the vernacular mobility term 'Podgori√ßani' (literally meaning 'people that came from Podgori√ßa', the present-day capital of Montenegro) refers to the progeny of Balkan Muslims, who migrated to Shkodra in four historical periods and in highest numbers after the Congress of Berlin 1878. Like the Ulqinak, the Podgori√ßani thus personify the mass forced displacement of the Muslim population from the Balkans and the 'unmixing of peoples' (see e.g. Brubaker 1996, 153) at the time of the retreat of the Ottoman Empire, which has only recently sparked renewed scholarly interest (e.g. Blumi 2013; Chatty 2013).\\" ; p. 406.. \\"Migration to Shkodra was mostly from the villages to the south-east of the city and from the cities of Podgorica and Ulcinj in Montenegro. This was connected to the independence of Montenegro from the Ottoman Empire in the year 1878 and the acquisition of additional territories, e.g. Ulcinj in 1881 (Ippen, 1907, p. 3).\\"  Sanjak of Ni≈ü  = Background = Toponyms such as Arbana≈°ka and ƒêjake shows an Albanian presence in the Toplica and Southern Morava regions (located north-east of contemporary Kosovo) since the Late Middle Ages.. \\"Esht√´, po ashtu, me pesh√´ historike nj√´ sh√´nim i M.

Then there to Mount ƒêjake, is the castle that served Ivan (John) and Albanians used to defend themselves. There were traces not only from the 13th and 14th centuries, but the 15th century where we see fairly multiple toponymic traces like the village Arbana≈°ka, river Arbana≈°ka, mountain Arbana≈°ka, village ƒêjake, mountain ƒêjake and others.

Residents of Ivankula headed by Ivan Beg are living there since the 14th century and they are of Albanian origin. Albanians belong to three religions, but most of them belong to the Muslim one, after Orthodoxy and then a minority belongs to the Catholic confession.

Due to the Ottoman-Habsburg wars and their aftermath, Albanians from contemporary northern Albania and Western Kosovo settled in wider Kosovo and the Toplica and Morava regions in the second half of the 18th century, at times instigated by Ottoman authorities. On the eve of the outbreak of a second round of hostilities between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire in 1877, a notable Muslim population existed in the districts of Ni≈°, Pirot, Vranje, Leskovac, Prokuplje and Kur≈°umlija. The rural parts of Toplica, Kosanica, Pusta Reka and Jablanica valleys and adjoining semi-mountainous interior was inhabited by compact Muslim Albanian population while Serbs in those areas lived near the river mouths and mountain slopes and both peoples inhabited other regions of the South Morava river basin.. \\"During the second war (December 1877 - January 1878) the Muslim population fled towns (Vranya (Vranje), Leskovac, √úrg√ºp (Prokuplje), Ni≈ü (Ni≈°), ≈ûehirk√∂y (Pirot), etc.) as well as rural settlements where they comprised ethnically compact communities (certain parts of Toplica, Jablanica, Pusta Reka, Masurica and other regions in the South Morava River basin). At the end of the war these Muslim refugees ended up in the region of Kosovo and Metohija, in the territory of the Ottoman Empire, following the demarcation of the new border with the Principality of Serbia. [38] [38] On Muslim refugees (muhaciri) from the regions of southeast Serbia, who relocated in Macedonia and Kosovo, see Trifunovski 1978, Radovanoviƒç 2000.\\" The Muslim population of most of the area was composed out of ethnic Gheg Albanians and with Turks located in urban centres. Part of the Turks were of Albanian origin. The Muslims in the cities of Ni≈° and Pirot were Turkish-speaking; Vranje and Leskovac were Turkish- and Albanian-speaking; Prokuplje and Kur≈°umlija were Albanian-speaking. Muslim Romani were also present within the wider area. There was also a minority of Circassian refugees settled by the Ottomans during the 1860s, near the then border around the environs of Ni≈°..

Shepherd (1923) =Population figures= Estimates vary on the size of the Muslim population within these areas. In his extensive studies of Ottoman population movements, American historian Justin McCarthy regarding the Muslim population of the Sanjak of Ni≈ü gives the figure of 131,000 Muslims in 1876, with only 12,000 remaining in 1882... \\"Justin McCarthy has, along with other historians, provided a necessary corrective to much of the history produced by scholars of the Armenian genocide in the United States. McCarthy demonstrates that not all of the ethnic cleansing and ethnic killing in the Ottoman Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries followed the model often posited in the West, whereby all the victims were Christian and all the perpetrators were Muslim. McCarthy has shown that there were mass killings of Muslims and deportations of millions of Muslims from the Balkans and the Caucasus over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy, who is labeled (correctly in this author's estimation) as being pro- Turkish by some writers and is a denier of the Armenian genocide, has estimated that about 5.5 million Muslims were killed in the hundred years from 1821‚Äì1922. Several million more refugees poured out of the Balkans and Russian conquered areas, forming a large refugee (muhajir) community in Istanbul and Anatolia.\\". \\"In the Balkans all statistics of death remain contested. Most of the following figures derive from McCarthy (1995: 1, 91, 161‚Äì4, 339), who is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate. Yet even if we reduced his figures by as much as 50 percent, they would still horrify. He estimates that between 1811 and 1912, somewhere around 5 1/2 million Muslims were driven out of Europe and million more were killed or died of disease or starvation while fleeing. Cleansing resulted from Serbian and Greek independence in the 1820s and 1830s, from Bulgarian independence in 1877, and from the Balkan wars culminating in 1912.\\" Whereas historian Noel Malcolm gives the figure for the Albanian population of the area as numbering around 110,000. Albanian historians such as the late Sabit Uka postulate that 110,000 is a conservative estimate based on Austro- Hungarian statistics and gives a higher figure of 200,000 for the total Albanian population of the area.. Other Albanian researchers like Emin Pllana, Sk√´nder Rizaj and Turkish historian Bilal ≈ûim≈üir place the number of Albanian refugees from the region as numbering between 60‚Äì70,000 people..... \\"The Serbian-Ottoman wars 1877/1878, followed mass and forceful movements of Albanians from their native territories. By the end of 1878 there were 60,000 Albanian refugees in Macedonia and 60,000-70,000 in the villayet of Kosova. At the 1878 Congress of Berlin, the Albanian territories of Ni≈°, Prokuple, Kur≈°umlia, Vranje and Leskovac were given to Serbia.\\" Albanologist Robert Elsie estimates the number of Albanian refugees at some 50,000.. Jovan Cvijiƒá estimated that the number of Albanian refugees from Serbia was about 30,000 a figure which current day Serbian historians such as Du≈°an Batakoviƒá also maintain... \\"In the 1980s and 1990s, overtly nationalist Serbian scholars such as Du≈°an Batakoviƒá received the most generous support for the publication of their work. The focus of much of such nationalist history was Kosovo.[2].... [2] Batakoviƒá wrote a series of nationalist works on Kosovo, of which several (The Kosovo Chronicles [Belgrade, 1992] and Kosovo, la spirale de la haine [Paris, 1993]) have been translated into other languages. Many similar works have not been translated: e.g., Kosovo i Metohija u srpskoj istoriji, ed. R. Samard≈æiƒá (Belgrade, 1989); D. Bogdanoviƒá, Knjiga o Kosovu (Belgrade, 1985); and A. Uro≈°eviƒá, Etniƒçki procesi na Kosovu tokom turske vludavine (Belgrade, 1987).\\" That number was accepted by Serbian historiography and remained unquestioned for almost a century. Drawing upon Serbian archive and travelers documents historian Milo≈° Jagodiƒá believes that the number of Albanians and Muslims that left Serbia was \\"much larger\\", agreeing with ƒêorƒëe Stefanoviƒá that the number was 49,000 Albanian refugees out of at least 71,000 Muslims that left. =Prelude= There were multiple reasons held by the Serbian government for the expulsions. Serbian authorities intended to expel the Muslim population, as they were deemed unreliable and undesirable that needed to be substituted with other inhabitants. Retaliation for attitudes held toward Christians within the Ottoman state was also used as a motive. Prime Minister Jovan Ristiƒá wanted a homogeneous country, without Muslims and with a reliable population in the area. Ristiƒá viewed Albanian populated territories as strategically important and representing a future base to expand into Ottoman Kosovo and Macedonia. General Kosta Protiƒá, who led the Serbian army during the war, did not want Serbia to have \\"its Caucasus\\", as an Albanian minority was viewed as a possible security concern. Supporting Protiƒá's views for expulsion of the Muslim population, including Albanians, were most of the senior Serbian army officers and Prince Milan.. \\"–ö–Ω–µ–∑ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω —Å–µ —É —Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –Ω–∞–ª–∞–∑–∏–æ —É –ù–∏—à—É, –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω —Å–≤–æ—ò–∏–º –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–∏–º–∞. –ü–æ—Å–µ–±–Ω–æ —ò–µ –±–∏–æ –±–ª–∏–∑–∞–∫ —Å–∞ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–æ–º –ö–æ—Å—Ç–æ–º –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–∏—õ–µ–º –∏ —É –∫–æ–Ω–∑—É–ª—Å–∫–∏–º –∫—Ä—É–≥–æ–≤–∏–º–∞ —É –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—É —Å–µ —Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–æ –¥–∞ —ò–µ –≤–ª–∞–¥–∞—Ä –ø–æ–¥ —ö–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏–º —É—Ç–∏—Ü–∞—ò–µ–º. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–∏—õ —ò–µ —Ç–æ–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞—Ç–∞, –∞ –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —ö–µ–≥–∞, –±–∏–æ –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∏ –∑–∞–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ –∏—Å–µ—ô–∞–≤–∞—ö–∞ –º—É—Å–ª–∏–º–∞–Ω–∞, –ø–∞ –∏ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–∞, –∏–∑ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ. –ä–µ–≥–æ–≤–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–æ–≤–µ –¥–µ–ª–∏–æ —ò–µ –∏ –≤–µ—õ–∏ –¥–µ–æ –≤–∏—à–∏—Ö –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–∞ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ –≤–æ—ò—Å–∫–µ. –ö–Ω–µ–∑ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω —ò–µ —Ç–æ–∫–æ–º —Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –±–∏–æ —Å–∞–≥–ª–∞—Å–∞–Ω —Å–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–≤–∞—ö–µ–º –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–∞. [Prince Milan at that time was located in Ni≈°, surrounded by his officers. He was especially close with General Kosta Protiƒá and the consulate circles in Belgrade was thought to be the ruler under his influence. General Protiƒá during the war, and after him, was the chief proponent of the policy of the eviction of Muslims, including Albanians, from Serbia. His attitude was shared by most of the senior officers of the Serbian army. Prince Milan during the war, was in conformity with the expulsion of Albanians.]\\" = Expulsion = Hostilities broke out on 15 December 1877, after a Russian request for Serbia to enter the conflict. The Serbian military crossed the border in two directions. The first objective was to capture Ni≈° and the second to break the Ni≈°-Sofia lines of communication for Ottoman forces. After besieging Ni≈°, Serbian forces headed south-west into the Toplica valley to prevent a counterattack by Ottoman forces. Prokuplje was taken on the third day of the war and local Albanians fled their homes toward the Pasjaƒça mountain range, leaving cattle and other property behind. Some Albanians returned and submitted to Serbian authorities, while others fled to Kur≈°umlija. Advancing Serbian forces heading to Kur≈°umlija also came across resisting Albanian refugees spread out in the surrounding mountain ranges and refusing to surrender. Many personal belongings such as wagons were strewn and left behind in the woods. Kur≈°umlija was taken soon after Prokuplje, while Albanian refugees had reached the southern slopes of the Kopaonik mountain range.. \\"But when General Josef Freiherr von Philipovich led the Austro- Hungarian troops into Bosnia in the summer of 1878, the time for mosque burning and religious cleansing was over. Balkan developments always lagged behind Europe. Muslim Albanians were obliged to flee Kursumlije in 1878 after Serbia expanded into the four southern districts of Ni≈°, Pirot, Toplica and Vranje. But when the Serbians moved into Kosovo in 1912, they were no longer pursuing the goal of a pure Orthodox Christian state.\\" Ottoman forces attempted to counterattack through the Toplica valley and relieve the siege at Ni≈°, which turned the area into a battlefield and stranded Albanian refugees in nearby mountains. With Ni≈° eventually taken, the refugees of the Toplica valley were unable to return to their villages. Other Serbian forces then headed south into the Morava valley and toward Leskovac. The majority of urban Muslims fled, taking most of their belongings before the Serbian army arrived. The Serbian army also took Pirot and the Turks fled to Kosovo, Macedonia and some went toward Thrace. Ottoman forces surrendered Ni≈° on 10 January 1878 and most Muslims departed for Pristina, Prizren, Skopje and Thessalonika. The Albanian neighbourhood in Ni≈° was burned..\\"This was the year that saw Serbia expanding southward and taking Nis. The Albanian quarter was burned and Albanians from the surrounding villages forced to flee.\\" Serbian forces continued their southwest advance entering the valleys of Kosanica, Pusta Reka and Jablanica. Serbian forces in the Morava valley continued to head for Vranje, with the intention of then turning west and entering Kosovo proper. The Serbian advance in the southwest was slow, due to the hilly terrain and much resistance by local Albanians who were defending their villages and also sheltering in the nearby Radan and Majdan mountain ranges. Serbian forces took these villages one by one and most remained vacant. Albanian refugees continued to retreat toward Kosovo and their march was halted at the Goljak Mountains when an armistice was declared. The Serbian army operating in the Morava valley continued south toward two canyons: Grdelica (between Vranje and Leskovac) and Veternica (southwest of Grdelica). After Grdelica was taken, Serbian forces took Vranje. Local Muslims had left with their belongings prior to Serbian forces reaching the town, and other Muslims of the countryside experienced tensions with Serbian neighbours who fought against and eventually evicted them from the area. Albanian refugees defended the Veternica canyon, before retreating toward the Goljak mountains. Albanians who lived nearby in the Masurica region did not resist Serbian forces, and General Jovan Belimarkoviƒá refused to carry out orders from Belgrade to deport these Albanians by offering his resignation. Ottoman sources state that Serbian forces during the war destroyed mosques in Vranje, Leskovac and Prokuplje. = Aftermath = In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Congress of Berlin acknowledged those territorial gains and the area became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, known as Novi Krajevi/Novi Oblasti or new areas.. \\"The so-called New Areas (Nove oblasti) were given their final legal shape under a special law, in the form of the counties of: Ni≈°, Vranje, Pirot and Toplica.\\". \\"The most readily available example of this balancing the domestic political needs of radical nationalists with larger economic demands is the management of the so- called Novi Krajevi (new areas) of Ni≈° recently transferred to Serbia.\\" Due to depopulation and economic considerations some small numbers of Albanians were allowed to stay and return though not to their previous settlements and instead were designated concentrated village clusters in the Toplica, Masurica and Jablanica areas. Of those only in the Jablanica valley centered around the town of Medveƒëa have small numbers of Albanians and their descendants remained..\\"N√´ koh√´t e sotme fshatra t√´ Jabllanic√´s, t√´ banuara kryesisht me shqiptare, jan√´ k√´to: Tupalla, Kapiti, G√´rbavci, Sfirca, Llapashtica e Ep√´rrne.

[In contemporary times, villages in the Jablanica area, inhabited mainly by Albanians, are these: Tupale, Kapiti, Grbavce, Svirca, Gornje Lapa≈°tica. Meanwhile, the mixed villages populated by Albanians, Montenegrins and Serbs, are these: Stara Banja, Ravna Banja, Sjarinska Banja, ƒêulekre≈°ta (ƒêulekari) Sijarina and the municipal center Medveƒëa. Two Albanian families are also encountered in the neighborhood of Marovica called Sinanovo, and some families in the center of Leskovac. Vllasa is formally a neighborhood of the village Grbavce, Dediƒái is a neighborhood of Medveƒëa and Dukati, a neighborhood of Sijarina. So this is the demographic situation in question that remains, somewhat different before World War II as Sijarina and ƒêulekari were villages with mixed populations, even in this latter settlement were many Serb families, and now the majority is made up of Albanians.]\\" This was due to a local Ottoman Albanian commander Shahid Pasha from the Jablanica area negotiating on good terms with Prince Milan and thereby guaranteeing their presence.. Some other Albanians such as merchants attempted to remain in Ni≈°, but they left after murders occurred and their property was sold off at low values. In 1879, some Albanian refugees from the Leskovac region complained in a petition that their properties and Muslim buildings had been demolished and could no longer return. The only other Muslim population permitted to remain were the Muslim Romani who in 1910 numbered 14,335 in all of Serbia with 6,089 located in Vranje.. \\"Vranje itself became a major Gypsy centre, with a large population of Serbian-speaking Muslim Gypsies. After the nineteenth- century expulsions of Muslim Slavs and Muslim Albanians from the Serbian state, these Gypsies were virtually the only Muslims permitted to remain on Serbian soil: in 1910 there were 14,335 Muslims in the whole kingdom of Serbia (6,089 of them in Vranje), and roughly 90 per cent of the urban Muslims were Gypsies. A campaign by the Orthodox Church did succeed in converting more than 2,000 of them in the 1890s; but in general Serbian attitudes to the Gypsies have combined social contempt (of the sort expressed by all Balkan peoples towards them) with an element of tolerance or even indulgence.\\" Most remaining Albanians were forced to leave in subsequent years for the Ottoman Empire and Kosovo in particular.. Serbs from the Lab river region moved to Serbia during and after the war of 1876 and incoming Albanian refugees (muhaxhir√´) repopulated their villages. Apart from the Lab river region, sizeable numbers of Albanian refugees were resettled in other parts of northern Kosovo alongside the new Ottoman-Serbian border.. Most Albanian refugees were resettled in over 30 large rural settlements in central and southeastern Kosovo... Many refugees were also spread out and resettled in urban centers that increased their populations substantially.. Western diplomats reporting in 1878 placed the number of refugee families at 60,000 families in Macedonia, with 60-70,000 refugees from Serbia spread out within the vilayet of Kosovo. The Ottoman governor of the Vilayet of Kosovo estimated in 1881 the refugees number to be around 65,000 with some resettled in the Sanjaks of √úsk√ºp and Yeni Pazar. Some of these Albanian refugees were also resettled in other parts of the Ottoman Empire such as the Samsun region of the Black Sea..\\"Using secondary sources, we establish that there have been Albanians living in the area of Nish for at least 500 years, that the Ottoman Empire controlled the area from the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries which led to many Albanians converting to Islam, that the Muslim Albanians of Nish were forced to leave in 1878, and that at that time most of these Nishan Albanians migrated south into Kosovo, although some went to Skopje in Macedonia. ; p. 557. It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912‚Äì13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants' children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912‚Äì13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish... Our interviews indicate that Samsun Albanians descend from Albanians who had been living in the villages around the city of Nish‚Ä¶ pp. 557‚Äì558. In 1690 much of the population of the city and surrounding area was killed or fled, and there was an emigration of Albanians from the Mal√´sia e Madhe (North Central Albania/Eastern Montenegro) and Dukagjin Plateau (Western Kosovo) into Nish. Tensions within the Kosovo vilayet between Albanian refugees and local Albanians arose over resources, as the Ottoman Empire found it difficult to accommodate to their needs and meager conditions. These refugees also became a strong opposition group to governance by the Sultan.. \\"As these Ni≈° refugees waited for acknowledgment from locals, they took measures to ensure that they were properly accommodated by often confiscating food stored in towns. They also simply appropriated lands and began to build shelter on them. A number of cases also point to banditry in the form of livestock raiding and \\"illegal\\" hunting in communal forests, all parts of refugees' repertoire... At this early stage of the crisis, such actions overwhelmed the Ottoman state, with the institution least capable of addressing these issues being the newly created Muhacirin M√ºd√ºriyeti... Ignored in the scholarship, these acts of survival by desperate refugees constituted a serious threat to the established Kosovar communities. The leaders of these communities thus spent considerable efforts lobbying the Sultan to do something about the refugees. While these Ni≈° muhacirs would in some ways integrate into the larger regional context, as evidenced later, they, and a number of other Albanian-speaking refugees streaming in for the next 20 years from Montenegro and Serbia, constituted a strong opposition block to the Sultan's rule.\\"; p.53. \\"One can observe that in strategically important areas, the new Serbian state purposefully left the old Ottoman laws intact. More important, when the state wished to enforce its authority, officials felt it necessary to seek the assistance of those with some experience, using the old Ottoman administrative codes to assist judges make rulings. There still remained, however, the problem of the region being largely depopulated as a consequence of the wars... Belgrade needed these people, mostly the landowners of the productive farmlands surrounding these towns, back. In subsequent attempts to lure these economically vital people back, while paying lip-service to the nationalist calls for \\"purification,\\" Belgrade officials adopted a compromise position that satisfied both economic rationalists who argued that Serbia needed these people and those who wanted to separate \\"Albanians\\" from \\"Serbs.\\" Instead of returning back to their \\"mixed\\" villages and towns of the previous Ottoman era, these \\"Albanians,\\" \\"Pomaks,\\" and \\"Turks\\" were encouraged to move into concentrated clusters of villages in Masurica, and Gornja Jablanica that the Serbian state set up for them. For this \\"repatriation\\" to work, however, authorities needed the cooperation of local leaders to help persuade members of their community who were refugees in Ottoman territories to \\"return.\\" In this regard, the collaboration between Shahid Pasha and the Serbian regime stands out. An Albanian who commanded the Sofia barracks during the war, Shahid Pasha negotiated directly with the future king of Serbia, Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá, to secure the safety of those returnees who would settle in the many villages of Gornja Jablanica. To help facilitate such collaborative ventures, laws were needed that would guarantee the safety of these communities likely to be targeted by the rising nationalist elements infiltrating the Serbian army at the time. Indeed, throughout the 1880s, efforts were made to regulate the interaction between exiled Muslim landowners and those local and newly immigrant farmers working their lands. Furthermore, laws passed in early 1880 began a process of managing the resettlement of the region that accommodated those refugees who came from Austrian-controlled Herzegovina and from Bulgaria. Cooperation, in other words, was the preferred form of exchange within the borderland, not violent confrontation.\\" Tensions in the form of revenge attacks also arose by incoming Albanian refugees on local Kosovo Serbs that contributed to the beginnings of the ongoing Serbian-Albanian conflict in coming decades.. \\"For Serbia the war of 1878, where the Serbians fought side by side with Russian and Romanian troops against the Ottoman Empire, and the Berlin Congress were of central importance, as in the Romanian case. The beginning of a new quality of the Serbian-Albanian history of conflict was marked by the expulsion of Albanian Muslims from Ni≈° Sand≈æak which was part and parcel of the fighting (Clewing 2000 : 45ff.; Jagodiƒá 1998 ; Pllana 1985). Driving out the Albanians from the annexed territory, now called \\"New Serbia,\\" was a result of collaboration between regular troops and guerrilla forces, and it was done in a manner which can be characterized as ethnic cleansing, since the victims were not only the combatants, but also virtually any civilian regardless of their attitude towards the Serbians (M√ºller 2005b). The majority of the refugees settled in neighboring Kosovo where they shed their bitter feelings on the local Serbs and ousted some of them from merchant positions, thereby enlarging the area of Serbian-Albanian conflict and intensifying it.\\" The expulsions also triggered the emergence of the League of Prizren (1878‚Äì1881) as a reaction to prevent further territories with Albanian populations from being awarded to Serbia and Montenegro.. \\"In consequence of the Russian-Ottoman war, a violent expulsion of nearly the entire Muslim, predominantly Albanian-speaking, population was carried out in the sanjak of Ni≈° and Toplica during the winter of 1877-1878 by the Serbian troops. This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The displaced persons (Alb. muhaxhir√´, Turk. muhacir, Serb. muhad≈æir) took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April of 1878.... The account shows that these displaced persons (muhaxhir√´) were highly hostile to the local Slav population. But also the Albanian peasant population did not welcome the refugees, since they constituted a factor of economic rivalry. As a consequence of these expulsions, the interreligious and interethnic relations worsened. Violent acts of Muslims against Christians, in the first place against Orthodox but also against Catholics, accelerated. This can he explained by the fears of the Muslim population in Kosovo that were stimulated by expulsions of large Muslim population groups in other parts of the Balkans in consequence of the wars in the nineteenth century in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated and new Balkan states were founded. The latter pursued a policy of ethnic homogenisation expelling large Muslim population groups.\\"; p. 467. \\"See K.

Clewing (as well as M√ºller) sees the expulsions of 1877 ‚Äì 1878 as a crucial reason for the culmination of the interethnic relations in Kosovo and 1878 as the epoch year in the Albanian-Serbian conflict history.\\" Amidst these events, during spring/summer 1879, multiple violent and predatory raids were conducted into Serbia by groups of Albanian refugees into former areas of residence, at times with the acquiescence of Ottoman authorities.. \\"–û–¥–ª—É–∫–µ –ë–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥ –∫–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å–∞ –æ —É–≤–µ—õ–∞—ö—É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ, –ø–æ—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∞ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∏–∑ –Ω–µ–¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ –∑–∞–≤—Ä—à–µ–Ω–æ–≥ —Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–∏–≤ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥ –±—Ä–æ—ò–∞ –º—É—Å–ª–∏–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–∑–±–µ–≥–ª–∏—Ü–∞ —É—Ç–∏—Ü–∞–ª–∏ —Å—É –Ω–∞ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω—Ü–µ –¥–∞ —É –ö–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤–∏–Ω–∏ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—ò—É –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤—É –∫–æ—ò–∞, —Å–∫—É–ø–∞ —Å–∞ –¶—Ä–Ω–æ–º –ì–æ—Ä–æ–º –∏ –ì—Ä—á–∫–æ–º, –Ω–∞–≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞–≤–∞ —ö–∏—Ö–æ–≤–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—É–ª–∏—Å–∞–Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–æ–º –ü—Ä–∏–∑—Ä–µ–Ω—Å–∫–µ –ª–∏–≥–µ. –ù–µ–º–∏—Ä–∏ –∏ –≤—Ä–µ—ö–∞ –∫–æ—ò–µ —ò–µ –∞–ª–±–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç –∏–∑–∞–∑–∏–≤–∞–æ —É –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–º –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º –≤–∏–ª–∞—ò–µ—Ç–∏–º–∞ —Ç–æ–∫–æ–º —á–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–∏ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞—ö–∞ –õ–∏–≥–µ (1878‚Äì1881), –æ–¥—Ä–∞–∂–∞–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Å—É –∏ –Ω–∞ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò—É –∏ —Ç–æ –Ω–∞—ò—á–µ—à—õ–µ –∫—Ä–æ–∑ –∏–∑–∞–∑–∏–≤–∞—ö–µ –∏–Ω—Ü–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —ö–µ–Ω–æ—ò –Ω–æ–≤–æ—ò —ò—É–∂–Ω–æ—ò –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∏. –£–ø–∞–¥–∏ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–∞ –∏–∑ –ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –û—Å–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò—É, –ø—Ä–µ—Ü–∏–∑–Ω–∏—ò–µ —É –¢–æ–ø–ª–∏—á–∫–∏ –∏ –í—Ä–∞—ö—Å–∫–∏ –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥, –ø–æ—á–µ–ª–∏ —Å—É –æ–¥–º–∞—Ö –Ω–∞–∫–æ–Ω —Ä–∞–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—ö–∞ 1878. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ. –ü–æ—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–∞, –Ω–µ–¥–æ–≤–æ—ô–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ—ô–µ–Ω–∞ –∏ —Å–∞ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–µ—É—Ç–≤—Ä—í–µ–Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, –∫–∞–æ –∏ –Ω–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–∫ —ò–∞–∫–µ –æ—Å–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–µ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —É –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–º –≤–∏–ª–∞—ò–µ—Ç—É –æ–º–æ–≥—É—õ–∞–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Å—É –∏–Ω—Ü–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–µ –æ–≤–µ –≤—Ä—Å—Ç–µ. –£ —Ç–æ–∫—É –ø—Ä–æ–ª–µ—õ–∞ –∏ –ª–µ—Ç–∞ 1879. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ —É–ø–∞–¥–∏ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–∞ –±–∏–ª–∏ —Å—É –Ω–∞—ò—É—á–µ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—ò–∏, –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ —Å–≤–∞–∫–æ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏. –ä–∏—Ö–æ–≤–∞ –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∞ –±–∏–ª–µ —Å—É –Ω–µ–º–∞–ª–µ —ô—É–¥—Å–∫–µ –∂—Ä—Ç–≤–µ –∏ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å–Ω–∞ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—ò–∞–ª–Ω–∞ —à—Ç–µ—Ç–∞. –ò–ø–∞–∫, —ö–∏—Ö–æ–≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò—Å–∫–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—ò –Ω–∏—ò–µ —É —Ç–æ–º–µ; –æ–Ω –ª–µ–∂–∏ —É –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–º –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∞–º–∞ —á–∏—ò–µ —Å—É –∏–º–ø–ª–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—ò–µ –¥–∞–ª–µ–∫–æ –ø—Ä–µ–≤–∞–∑–∏–ª–∞–∑–∏–ª–µ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –æ–±–∏—á–Ω–∏—Ö –ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∏—Ö —á–∞—Ä–∫–∏ –∏ –∫–æ—ò–µ —Å—É –∑–∞–¥–∏—Ä–∞–ª–µ –¥—É–±–æ–∫–æ —É —Å–∞–º—É —Å—É—à—Ç–∏–Ω—É –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–µ –∏ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ –ö–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤–∏–Ω–µ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ. [The decisions of the Berlin Congress on maximizing Serbia, devastating experience of the recent war and the influx of a large number of Muslim refugees had affected the Albanians to the Principality of Serbia recognize the country that, along with Montenegro and Greece, supposedly threatens their interests formulated program of the League of Prizren. The unrest and turmoil, which caused the Albanian movement in Kosovo and other vilayets during the four years of operation of the League (1878‚Äì1881), reflected on Serbia, mostly through provoking incidents in her new southern border. Raids Albanians from the bordering parts of the Ottoman Empire in Serbia, more precisely in Toplica and Vranje District, began immediately after the 1878 demarcation. The porous, sufficiently populated with Serbian foreign undetermined borders, and a lack of strong Ottoman rule in Kosovo Vilayet allowed the incidents of this kind. During the spring and summer of 1879 raids by Albanians were the most frequent, almost daily. Their immediate result was no small casualties and some damage. However, their historical significance is not that; here lies in diplomatic consequences whose implications far beyond the importance of common border skirmishes and which encroach deeply into the very essence of the state and national policy of the Principality of Serbia.]\\" In the aftermath of the war and expulsions, British diplomatic pressure for some time was applied to Serbia to allow the Albanian refugees to go and return to their homes, though it later subsided. The Ottoman Empire was lukewarm about returning refugees to Serbia as the refugees were seen as integral in demographically strengthening the Muslim element in its remaining territories such as Kosovo vilayet still under its sovereignty. Ethnic map of Medveƒëa municipality (2002 census). = International and local observations/reactions to events = Great Powers In April 1878, Jelinek, the Austro-Hungarian consul reported Muslim refugees arriving into Ottoman Kosovo with occurrences of typhoid outbreaks and some refugees being abysmally resettled within Prizren and Gjakova districts that overall contributed to their miserable state. Jelinek also noted the refugees hostility to Kosovo Serbs, as they committed acts of violence against them.. \\"The displaced persons (Alb. muhaxhir√´, Turk. muhacir, Serb. muhad≈æir) took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April of 1878 as follows: The continuous arrivals of Muslim refugees from the Serbian and Russian occupied Turkish territories have indisputably contributed not a little to the general discontent among the Muslim population, and still more to misery among the refugees, aggravated by the typhoid epidemic that has broken out among them in many places. In the Prizren district, 5000 refugees, and in Djakova, 2000, have been accommodated, of course in the most appalling manner. An immediate and highly regrettable consequence of the present precarious political situation, particularly for the Christians, is the general insecurity of life and property, which has been steadily worsening in Prizren and its suburbs for some time, in the most alarming ways. At least eight Greek- orthodox Slavs were treacherously murdered on the road between the railway stations at Lipljan and Veressovitz, [...] including Prizren's; and the panic among the Christians concerning the Muslims goes so far that all the traffic in the city ceases as soon as the sun goes down, and no one dares, even during the day, to venture alone into the neighbourhood, even for a few minutes.

Gould also noted that the refugees were \\"wandering about in a starving condition\\" and was instrumental for a time in applying British diplomatic pressure on Serbia to allow the refugees to return home.. \\"The other powers behaved as if the Albanians did not exist. At the Congress of Berlin, Disraeli and Bismarck had parcelled out Albanian lands both to Serbia and to Montenegro. Serbia received the Toplica region while Montenegro obtained the town of Podgorica and the port of Bar, to which a second port, Ulcinj, was added in 1880. When the Serbs expelled thousands of Albanians from the Toplica and Vranje area in 1878 to make way for colonists, the British Resident in Serbia, Gerald Francis Gould, complained to Lord Salisbury of Serbian brutality. 'The peaceful and industrious inhabitants of over 100 Albanian villages in the Toplitza and Vranja Valley were ruthlessly driven forth from their homesteads by the Servians [sic] in the early part of this year. These wretched people have ever since been wandering about in a starving condition,' he wrote. Nothing happened to Serbia as a result of these complaints, and the Serbs quickly and efficiently resettled the area.\\". \\"–û–Ω–∞ —ò–µ, –º–µ—í—É—Ç–∏–º, —É—Ç–∏—Ü–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –ì—É–ª–¥–∞ –¥–∞ —ò–æ—à –≤–∏—à–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω–∑–∏–≤–∏—Ä–∞ —Å–≤–æ—ò–∞ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—ò–∞—ö–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–µ –ø–∏—Ç–∞—ö–µ –∞–ª–±–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É–ø–∞–¥–∞ —Ä–µ—à–∏ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ü–∏—ò–æ–º –º—É—Ö–∞—ü–∏—Ä–∞. –î–æ–±–∏–≤—à–∏ –∑–∞ —Ç–æ –æ–¥–æ–±—Ä–µ—ö–µ —Å–≤–æ—ò–µ –≤–ª–∞–¥–µ, –ì—É–ª–¥ —ò–µ –ø–æ—á–µ—Ç–∫–æ–º —ò—É–Ω–∞ –ø–æ—á–µ–æ –¥–∞ –≤—Ä—à–∏ —ò–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∏—Ç–∏—Å–∞–∫ –Ω–∞ –†–∏—Å—Ç–∏—õ–∞ –¥–∞ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ –≤–ª–∞–¥–∞ –¥–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∞–∫ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–º–∞. –ò—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–æ —Å–µ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∏–æ –∏ –¥–∞ —É–±–µ–¥–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Ö —Å–∏–ª–∞ —É –∏—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç —Å–≤–æ–≥ –≥–ª–µ–¥–∏—à—Ç–∞. –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞—Ä –∏–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ª–∞ —ò–µ –∏–∑–±–µ–≥–∞–≤–∞–æ –¥–∞ –ì—É–ª–¥—É –ø—Ä—É–∂–∏ –±–∏–ª–æ –∫–∞–∫–∞–≤ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞–Ω –æ–¥–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä, –∏–∑–≥–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∞—ò—É—õ–∏ —Å–µ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—à—õ—É –ø–∏—Ç–∞—ö–∞, —É —á–∏—ò–µ–º —Ä–µ—à–∞–≤–∞—ö—É –∫–æ–Ω–∞—á–∞–Ω –æ–¥–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞–¥–∞ –∫–Ω–µ–∑—É. –ë—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫ —ò–µ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ—ò—É —Ä—É–∫—É, –±–µ–∑ —É–ø—É—Ç—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –æ–¥ –ø—Ä–µ—Ç–ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—ô–µ–Ω–∏—Ö, —Å–∞—á–∏–Ω–∏–æ —ò–µ–¥–∞–Ω –∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—á–∞–Ω –º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–¥—É–º –∫–æ—ò–∏–º —Å–µ –æ–¥ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ –∑–∞—Ö—Ç–µ–≤–∞ –¥–∞ –¥–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∞–∫ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–º–∞. –û–Ω —ò–µ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ –Ω–∞–≥–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏–æ –†–∏—Å—Ç–∏—õ—É –¥–∞ —õ–µ –º—É –∏—Å—Ç–∏ –±–∏—Ç–∏ —É—Ä—É—á–µ–Ω, —É–∫–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ –∫–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤ –æ–¥–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ –±–∏–æ –ø–æ–≤–æ—ô–∞–Ω. –°–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∞—ò—É—õ–∏ –ì—É–ª–¥–æ–≤ –∫–æ—Ä–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–µ–≤–∏—à–µ –∏—Å—Ö–∏—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–º, –°–æ–ª—Å–±–µ—Ä–∏ –º—É —ò–µ –Ω–∞–ª–æ–∂–∏–æ –¥–∞ —Å–µ —É–∑–¥—Ä–∂–∏ –æ–¥ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞—ò–µ –º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–¥—É–º–∞, –Ω–æ –†–∏—Å—Ç–∏—õ –Ω–∏—ò–µ –∏–º–∞–æ –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞ –¥–∞ –±—É–¥–µ —É–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç —Å–∞ —Ç–∏–º. –î–∞–∫–ª–µ, –†–∏—Å—Ç–∏—õ–µ–≤–æ–º –Ω–æ—Ç–æ–º –∏ –±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º –∏–Ω—Å–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ä–∞—ö–µ–º –Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∏, –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º –∞–ª–±–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É–ø–∞–¥–∞ —ò–µ –∏–∑–∞—à–∞–æ –≤–∞–Ω –æ–∫–≤–∏—Ä–∞ –±–∏–ª–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ª–Ω–∏—Ö —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ-—Ç—É—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ–¥–Ω–æ—Å–∞. –£ —ö–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ —Ä–µ—à–∞–≤–∞—ö–µ —Å—É —Å–µ —É–º–µ—à–∞–ª–µ —Å–∏–ª–µ, –∏–ª–∏ –±–æ—ô–µ —Ä–µ—á–µ–Ω–æ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ë—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—ò–∞, —á–∏—ò–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–≤ –Ω–∏—ò–µ –±–∏–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–Ω–∞–∫–ª–æ–Ω –ø—Ä–µ–º–∞ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏. –°–≤–∞–∫–∞–∫–æ –¥–∞ —ò–µ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ—ò –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—ò–∏ –±–∏–ª–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ª–∞–∫—à–µ –¥–∞ —Å–µ –Ω–æ—Å–∏ —É –æ–≤–æ–º –ø–∏—Ç–∞—ö—É —Å–∞–º–æ —Å–∞ –ü–æ—Ä—Ç–æ–º, –Ω–µ–≥–æ –∏ —Å–∞ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–º –ë—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—ò–æ–º. –î–∞ —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –±—É–¥–µ –≥–æ—Ä–∞, –±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–≤, –ø–∞ –∏ –ª–∏—á–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–≤ —ö–µ–Ω–æ–≥ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ì—É–ª–¥–∞, –º–æ—Ä–∞–ª–∏ —Å—É –¥–∞ –±—É–¥—É —É—Ç–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ –ø—Ä–µ —É–≤–∞–∂–∞–≤–∞–Ω–∏, —à—Ç–æ —ò–µ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∞ –±–∏–ª–∞ —É –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—É –ø—Ä–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞ —Å–∞ –æ–≤–æ–º —Å–∏–ª–æ–º –æ–∫–æ –∑–∞–∫—ô—É—á–µ—ö–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–Ω–æ–≥ —Ç—Ä–≥–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥ —É–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞, –∞ —É –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç—É —Å—É–∫–æ–±–∞ —Å–∞ –ê—É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ-–£–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–º –æ–∫–æ –∏—Å—Ç–æ–≥ –ø–∏—Ç–∞—ö–∞. [It is, however, affected Gould to further intensify their efforts to resolve the issue of the Albanian incursions and repatriation of the muhajirs. Having obtained the approval of their governments, Gould in early June began to exert strong pressure on Ristiƒá to Serbian government allow the return of Albanians. At the same time trying to convince deputies and other forces to share that point of view. Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs to Gould avoided to provide any concrete response, saying the importance of questions, whose resolution definitive answer belongs to the prince. British envoy was then on his own, without instructions from superiors, made an official memorandum from the Serbian request to allow the return of Albanians. He discreetly hinted Ristiƒá that he would be given the same if the prince's response was not favorable. Considering Gould's step too hasty, Salisbury ordered him to refrain from handing the memorandum, but Ristiƒá had no way to be familiar with it. So Ristiƒá noted the British insistence on repatriation, problem of the Albanian incursions goes beyond the Serbian-Turkish bilateral relations. In its resolution had interfered forces, or rather Great Britain, whose attitude was not disposed toward Serbia. Be sure that the Serbian diplomacy was much easier to deal in this matter only with the Porte, than with Great Britain.

On the other hand, Russia's vice-consul in the Kosovo vilayet Ivan Yastrebov advised the local Ottoman governor Nazif Pasha to prevent the return of refugees to Serbia as their presence within the Kosovo area would strengthen the local Muslim element..'\\"–ö–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ –≤–∞–ª–∏—ò–∞, –ù–∞–∑–∏—Ñ-–ø–∞—à–∞, –ø–æ–¥ —É—Ç–∏—Ü–∞—ò–µ–º —Ä—É—Å–∫–æ–≥ –≤–∏—Ü–µ–∫–æ–Ω–∑—É–ª–∞ —É –ü—Ä–∏–∑—Ä–µ–Ω—É, –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –à–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞, —Å—Ç–µ–∫–∞–æ —ò–µ —É–≤–µ—Ä–µ—ö–µ –¥–∞ —õ–µ –û—Å–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –º–æ—õ–∏ –¥–∞ –∑–∞–¥—Ä–∂–∏ —É –±—É–¥—É—õ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–æ—ò–µ –ø—Ä–µ–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–µ –±–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–µ —Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –∞–∫–æ —É —ö–∏–º–∞ –±—É–¥–µ —à—Ç–æ –≤–∏—à–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—Å–∞–ª–æ –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–æ, —Ç–µ —Å—Ç–æ–≥–∞ –ª–æ—ò–∞–ª–Ω–æ, –º—É—Å–ª–∏–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏—à—Ç–≤–æ. –à–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤—ô–µ–≤–∞ –∞—Ä–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ —ò–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –æ—ò–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –≤–µ—õ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—ò–µ—õ–µ –≤–∞–ª–∏—ò–∏–Ω–æ —É–±–µ—í–µ—ö–µ –¥–∞ –º—É—Å–ª–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏ –Ω–µ –±–∏ —Ç—Ä–µ–±–∞–ª–æ –¥–∞ –∂–∏–≤–µ —É —Ö—Ä–∏—à—õ–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞–º–∞ –∏ –¥–∞ —Å–µ –ø–æ–∫–æ—Ä–∞–≤–∞—ò—É –Ω–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—á–∫–∏–º –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–º–∞, —ò–µ—Ä —ò–µ —Ç–æ —É —Å—É–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–∞ –ö—É—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–º. –ö–∞–∫–æ —ò–µ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—ò–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–∞ –±–∏–ª–∞ —É –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ—ò —Å—É–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–∞ –æ–≤–æ–º —Å–≤–æ—ò–µ–≤—Ä—Å–Ω–æ–º \\"—Ç–µ–æ—Ä–∏—ò–æ–º –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—ò–µ\\", –æ–Ω –∏—Ö —ò–µ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ –æ–¥–≤—Ä–∞—õ–∞–æ –æ–¥ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–∞. –í–∞–∂–Ω–æ —ò–µ –∏—Å—Ç–∞—õ–∏ –¥–∞ —ò–µ –æ–≤–µ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—ò–µ –ø—Ä–∏–±–∞–≤–∏–æ —ò–µ–¥–∞–Ω —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É—Å–∫–∏ –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∞ —É –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ—ò –∫–æ–º—É–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∏ —Å–∞ –ù–∞–∑–∏—Ñ-–ø–∞—à–æ–º –∏ —Ç–æ –∫—Ä–∞—ò–µ–º —Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–±—Ä–∞ 1879. [Kosovo governor, Nazif Pasha, influenced by the Russian vice consul in Prizren, Ivan Yastrebov, gained confidence that the Ottoman Empire will be able in the future to keep its remaining Balkan territories only if in them is more like a religious is concentrated, and therefore loyal Muslim population. Jastrebov's argument is only strengthened the governor's already existing conviction that Muslims should not live in Christian countries and to obey infidel government, because it is contrary to the Quran. As the repatriation of Albanians was in direct opposition to this kind of \\"theory of the concentration\\", they were actively discouraged them from returning. It is important to note that this information is obtained by a French diplomat in direct communication with Nazif Pasha and to the end of September 1879.]\\" Serbian Josif H. Kostiƒá, a local school headmaster from Leskovac witnessing the flight of refugees during winter 1877 noted that many of them had fled their homes with meagre clothing and that from the \\"Gudelica gorge and as far as Vranje and Kumanovo, you could see the abandoned corpses of children, and old men frozen to death\\".. \\"This period also saw a deterioration in relations between the Muslims and Christians of Kosovo. The prime cause of this was the mass expulsion of Muslims from the lands taken over by Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro in 1877-8. Almost all the Muslims (except, as we have seen, some Gypsies) were expelled from the Morava valley region: there had been hundreds of Albanian villages there, and significant Albanian populations in towns such as Prokuplje, Leskovac and Vranje. A Serbian schoolmaster in Leskovac later recalled that the Muslims had been driven out in December 1877 at a time of intense cold: 'By the roadside, in the Gudelica gorge and as far as Vranje and Kumanovo, you could see the abandoned corpses of children, and old men frozen to death.' Precise figures are lacking, but one modern study concludes that the whole region contained more than 110,000 Albanians. By the end of 1878 Western officials were reporting that there were 60,000 families of Muslim refugees in Macedonia, 'in a state of extreme destitution', and 60-70,000 Albanian refugees from Serbia 'scattered' over the vilayet of Kosovo. Albanian merchants who tried to stay on in Ni≈° were subjected to a campaign of murders, and the property of those who left was sold off at one per cent of its value. In a petition of 1879 a group of Albanian refugees from the Leskovac area complained that their houses, mills, mosques and tekkes had all been demolished, and that 'The material arising from these demolitions, such as masonry and wood, has been sold, so that if we go back to our hearths we shall find no shelter.' This was not, it should be said, a matter of spontaneous hostility by local Serbs. Even one of the Serbian Army commanders had been reluctant to expel the Albanians from Vranje, on the grounds that they were a quiet and peaceful people. But the orders came from the highest levels in Belgrade: it was Serbian state policy to create an ethnically 'clean' territory. And in an act of breath- taking cynicism, Ivan Yastrebov, the vice-consul in Kosovo of Serbia's protector-power, Russia, advised the governor of the vilayet not to allow the refugees to return to Serbia, on the grounds that their presence on Ottoman soil would usefully strengthen the Muslim population. All these new arrivals were known as muhaxhirs (Trk.: muhacir Srb.: muhad≈æir), a general word for Muslim refugees. The total number of those who settled in Kosovo is not known with certainty: estimates ranged from 20,000 to 50,000 for Eastern Kosovo, while the governor of the vilayet gave a total of 65,000 in 1881, some of whom were in the sancaks of Skopje and Novi Pazar. At a rough estimate, 50,000 would seem a reasonable figure for those muhaxhirs of 1877-8 who settled in the territory of Kosovo itself. Apart from the Albanians, smaller numbers of Muslim Slavs came from Montenegro and Bosnia.\\". \\"nuk po z√´m√´ n√´ goj√´, me p√´rjashtim t√´ atyre pak t√´ dh√´nave q√´ i kishte par√´ me sy t√´ vet m√´suesi i Leskovcit, Josif Kostiq, i cili, nd√´r t√´ tjerash flet per disa pamje trishtuese e t√´ llahtarshme, q√´ i kishte par√´ personalisht me rastin e ikjes s√´ shqiptar√´ve, gjat√´ dimrit t√´ ftoht√´ t√´ vitit 1877‚Äì1878, ai thot√´: ¬´Pash√´ f√´mij√´, gra, pleq dhe plaka, t√´ cil√´t u detyruan t'i l√´n√´ dhomat e tyre t√´ ngrohta dhe t√´ marrin ikjen n√´ sy, dhe shum√´ prej tyre i v√´rejta se ishin t√´ zbathur dhe t√´ zdeshur¬ª.[168]...[168] Josif H.

[it won't go without mention, with the exception of few sources that who had seen with their own eyes the teacher from Leskovac, Josif Kostiƒá, who, among other things discusses some very sad sights of the horrible events, he had seen personally the occasion of the flight of the Albanians during the cold winter of 1877‚Äì1878, he says: ¬´I saw children, women, old men and old women, who were forced to leave their warm dwellings and take flight in the bosom of their eye, and i saw many of them were barefoot and undressed¬ª.[168]‚Ä¶ [168] Josif H. Kostiƒá, Oslobodjenje grada Leskovac, Leskovac, 1907, fq. 1‚Äì15.]\\" The journalist Manojlo ƒêorƒëeviƒá argued for peaceful reconciliation with the Albanians and condemned the policies undertaken by the Serbian state. In later years there were retrospective views regarding these events. Prior to the Balkan wars, Kosovo Serb community leader Janjiƒáije Popoviƒá stated that the wars of 1876‚Äì1878 \\"tripled\\" the hatred of Turks and Albanians, especially that of the refugee population toward the Serbs by committing acts of violence against them. Belgrade Professor of Law ≈Ωivojin Periƒá stated in 1900 that conciliatory treatment toward the Albanians by Serbia in allowing them to remain could have prevented such hostility and possibly gained Albanian sympathies. Scholar Jovan Had≈æi-Vasiljeviƒá noted in 1909 that the overall motivation for the expulsion was to \\"create a pure Serbian nation\\" through \\"cleansing\\" the area of non-Christians.. \\"In 1878, following a series of Christian uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, the Russo-Turkish War, and the Berlin Congress, Serbia gained complete independence, as well as new territories in the Toplica and Kosanica regions adjacent to Kosovo. These two regions had a sizable Albanian population which the Serbian government decided to deport. The Serbian Army Commander insisted that Serbia 'should not have its Caucasus' and the Prime Minister argued that the Albanian minority might represent a security concern. In 1909, Serbian intellectual Jovan Had≈æi-Vasiljeviƒá explained that the major motivation for the 1878 deportation was also to 'create a pure Serbian nation state' by 'cleansing' the land of the non-Christians, as 'the great Serbian poet Njego≈° argued'. Had≈æi-Vasiljeviƒá was here interpreting Njego≈° rather loosely, as Njego≈° work focused on the Slavonic Muslims and not on Albanian Muslims. The ominous implication was that Albanians, as non-Slavs, were not even capable of assimilation. While the Serbian state authorities repeatedly attempted to assimilate the Slavonic Muslims, they refrained from attempting to 'Serbianize' the Albanians. While both security concerns and the exclusive nationalist ideology influenced the government's policies, there was also some Serbian resistance to the 'cleansing' of the Albanians. General Jovan Belimarkovic opposed the deportation and offered his resignation to the government over this issue and journalist Manojlo ƒêjorƒëjeviƒá also condemned these policies and argued that Serbia should have pursued a policy of peaceful reconciliation towards the Albanians. In Toplica the Albanians were encountered, and we had nothing more important to do but to expel these warlike, but hard-working people from their homes. Instead of making a peace with them as the defeated side ‚Äì they were without any good reason pushed across the border ‚Äì so that they'll settle on the other side as the enemies of everything Serbian, to become the avengers towards those who pushed them from their homes. Despite some voices of dissent, the Serbian regime 'encouraged' about 71,000 Muslims, including 49,000 Albanians, 'to leave'. The regime then gradually settled Serbs and Montenegrins in these territories. Prior to 1878, the Serbs comprised not more than one half of the population of Nis, the largest city in the region; by 1884 the Serbian share rose to 80 per cent. According to Ottoman sources, Serbian forces also destroyed mosques in Leskovac, Prokuplje, and Vranje.\\" ; p.470. \\"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations. The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there. Janjiƒáije Popoviƒá, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876‚Äì8 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo. In 1900 ≈Ωivojin Periƒá, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion. The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians. From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks. Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state.\\" = Legacy = These events in later years would also serve as a possible Serbian solution to the Albanian question in Kosovo and Macedonia for individuals such as Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, who advocated similar measures due to their success.. \\"In 1937, an official memorandum titled 'Iseljavanje Arnauta\\" (The Expulsion of the Albanians) emerged from the mainstream Serbian political establishment. It was written by Vasa Cubriloviƒá, a political adviser to the royal Yugoslav government and conspirator in the 1914 assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the event which helped spark the First World War. \\"The Expulsion of the Albanians\\" argued that Hitler's and Stalin's success in expelling Jews and others presaged the success of a plan to render the lives of Albanians so intolerable and terror-filled that they would leave for Albania and Turkey:\\"; p. 6. \\"There is one more method which Serbia very effectively used after 1878, the secret burning of Albanian villages and town quarters.\\"..

They are known today as muhaxhir (derived from Arabic, via Ottoman, meaning exile or sometimes a more neutral, immigrant). Like similar groups throughout the world who have informed the nationalist lexicon-Heimatvertriebene, Galut/Tefutzot, al- Laj'iyn, Prosfyges, Pengungsi, Wakimbizi, P'akhstakanner-the \\"Nish muhaxhir\\" constitute a powerful sub-group in present-day Kosova's domestic politics and economy.\\"; p. 209. \\"These natives of Ni≈°'s primary historian is Sabit Uka, D√´bimi i Shqiptar√´ve nga Sanxhaku i Nishit dhe vendosja e tyre n√´ Kosov√´, 1878‚Äì1912, 4 vols. (Prishtine: Verana, 2004)\\". They have also established local associations that document and aim to preserve their regional Albanian culture of origin.. Many can also be identified by their surname which following Albanian custom is often the place of origin. For example: Shulemaja from the village of ≈†iljomana, Gjikolli from D≈æigolj, Pllana from Velika and Mala Plana, Retkoceri from Retkocer, Huruglica from Oruglica, Hergaja from Rgaje, By√ßmeti from Donji, Gornji and Srednji Buƒçumet, Nishliu from the city of Ni≈° and so on.. \\"Pra, k√´tu n√´ vazhdim, pas d√´bimit t√´ tyre me 1877‚Äì1878 do t√´ sh√´nohen vet√´m disa patronime (mbiemra) t√´ shqiptar√´ve t√´ Toplic√´s dhe viseve tjera shqiptare t√´ Sanxhakut t√´ Nishit.

[So here next, after their expulsion 1877‚Äì1878 will be noted with only some patronymic (surnames) of the Albanians of Toplica and other Albanian areas of Sanjak of Nis. This means that the Albanians expelled after moving, attained the appellation muhaxhir√´ (refugees), which instead for the family surname to take the name of his grandfather, clan, or any other, they for their family surname take the name of the village of the Sanjak of Nis from where they were expelled from.]\\" ; pp. 53‚Äì54. Within Serbia today though the Serbian-Ottoman wars of 1876‚Äì1878 are mentioned within school books, the Albanian population's expulsion by the Serbian army is omitted. This has limited Serbian students' knowledge of the events that led to bad relations amongst both peoples.. para. 11. \\"A similar topic could be found in textbooks when it comes to their coverage of the anti-Turkish wars of 1876‚Äì1878 which also triggered off migrations on a large scale. The Muslim (predominantly Albanian) population fled or was expelled from the territories liberated by Serbian and Montenegrin armies. However, although these wars are regularly mentioned in all schoolbooks dealing with the period, absolutely none of them makes mention of the expulsion of the Albanians. The case was similar to the one of the First Serbian Uprising, only expulsions of 1878 had more far- reaching consequences: the embittered Albanians were usually settled down in Kosovo, terrorizing the local Serbs, instigating them to flee to free Serbia and upsetting thus the ethnic balance still further. Without knowing these facts, students cannot understand the subsequent bad relations between the two peoples. In this way Serbian students are lulled into believing that their people always fought not only for the just cause, but also always with just means.\\"; para.12 \\"Closely connected with the wars of 1876‚Äì1878 is the beginning of the Albanian national awakening embodied in the League of Prizren which was set up by Albanian leaders in 1878 in order to prevent carving up of the Albanian-inhabited territories by victorious Serbia and Montenegro.\\" See also * Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78) * Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78) * League of Prizren * Albanian National Awakening * Ottoman Kosovo * Kosovo Albanians * Albanians in Montenegro * The Expulsion of the Albanians * Circassian genocide * Yugoslav colonisation of Kosovo References =Citations= =Sources=                      *  Further reading  *Clewing, Konrad (2000), \\"Mythen und Fakten zur Ethnostruktur in Kosovo-Ein geschichtlicher √úber- blick [Myths and facts about the ethnic structure of Kosovo-a historical overview]\\".

The article was used to attack Ruhollah Khomeini, described as an Indian Sayyed, who later founded the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Background  The hostilities between Iran and Iraq ended with a treaty proposed in 1975. Iranians were allowed to travel to Iraq in 1976. As result many tapes and writings of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who was in exile in Iraq, were brought into Iran. Disapproval of the Shah was increasing in Iranian mosques. People were demanding that the Constitution of 1906/07 be fully restored. Articles in the constitution included: the right to free elections, a government responsible to the elected legislative body or the Majles , a Shah with limited authority, and a committee of Mujtahids to veto bills not deemed to be in accord with Muslim law. In October 1977, the mysterious death of Khomeini's son Mostafa caused the people's dissatisfaction to grow, in part because journalists Nikki Keddie and Yann Richard attributed his death to SAVAK, Iran's secret police. In January 1978, in an attempt to reduce religious opposition inciting people against the Shah, the Iranian newspaper Ettela'at published an article entitled \\"Iran and Red and Black Colonization\\" which attacked Ruhollah Khomeini. The article was published one week after a speech by President Jimmy Carter in which he referred to Iran as an \\"island of stability\\" in one of the more troubled areas of the world.  Events  On 4 January 1978, the article \\"Iran and Red and Black Colonization\\" was sealed in the Imperial Court and sent from Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, who is thought to have written it, to Information Minister Daryush Homayun for publication in one of Iran's newspapers. The regime saw the article as a way to attack its religious opponents. It was published on 7 January 1978 in Ettela'at, printed in red ink on page 7 in the section known as \\"Comments and Ideas\\". The article contained offensive content about Ayatollah Khomeini, who was described as a foreign agent. Khomeini was attacked as an adventurer who was faithless and devoted to colonialism. The article described him as an Indian Sayyed who had lived for some time in India, and had contact with British colonial centres. The article was written at the Imperial Court based on documents that had been collected by SAVAK. Because the original text of the article was relatively tame, the Shah had allegedly ordered it to be rewritten and its tone had then become more insulting. Ahmad Rashidi Motlagh was the fictitious name of the author of \\"Iran and Red and Black Colonization\\". According to Bahman Baktiari, the main authors of the article were Daryush Homayun and Farhad Nikukhah, a low-ranking ministry official. The day that the article was published fell on the anniversary of the unveiling when Reza Shah had declared the law banning women from wearing the hijab.  Reaction  One day after the publication of the article, it was met with huge protests in Qom. Classes at Qom's seminary were cancelled. People went to the homes of Marja' in Tehran and Qom to show their support. In the evening, at the Azam mosque of Qom, they chanted slogans such as \\"Long live Khomeini\\" and \\"Death to the Pahlavi regime\\". On 9 January, the protests continued and grew larger. The Bazaar was closed. In the afternoon, police began firing into the crowd killing and injuring many people. The day after the shootings, people gathered to protest and to commemorate the deaths in many Iranian cities including: Tabriz, Yazd, Isfahan, Shiraz, Jahrom, and Ahwaz. The article's publication was generally recognized as the beginning of the Iranian Revolution and four hundred days later the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown. This article had the effect of placing Khomeini at the center of the revolutionary movement.

It is a shrub with narrow leaves, brightly coloured sepals and petals growing in two widely separated areas. Description Eremophila micrantha is an erect shrub growing to a height of between with its branches and leaves covered with fine grey hairs, although resin secretions may make these parts sticky and the hairs difficult to discern. The leaves are arranged alternately and are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and have prominent raised resin glands especially on the edges and lower surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, egg-shaped to lance-shaped yellow to red sepals which are long but which enlarge after flowering. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube and lobes are cream-coloured to pale yellow with bright red spots on the outside but not inside. The outer surface of the tube and both surfaces of the lobes are glabrous but there is a band of soft hairs inside the tube. The 4 stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and the fruits which follow are oval to cone-shaped with a pointed end and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (mirabilis) is a Latin word meaning \\"wonderful\\" or \\" strange\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila mirabilis occurs in two disjunct locations, one near Niagara and the other north of Mullewa in the Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Plants in both areas grow in stony clay on laterite slopes. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that is poorly known and from only one or a few locations. Use in horticulture The unusual flower colouring of this eremophila, with spots on the outside of the petal tube, and the long-lasting, large red or yellow sepals makes it a valuable addition to a garden or for a container plant on a patio. It can be propagated from cuttings but these are often slow to strike. A preferred method is grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. This shrub prefers well-drained soil in full sun and although moderately drought tolerant, needs occasional watering in a long drought. It is not frost hardy, so needs to be grown in a sunny part of the garden.

In 1979, he began working in the postroom of the GMB, over time being promoted to become a legal officer, then an organiser, and finally in 2007 as the union's Regional Secretary for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire. In 2009, Roache led a 13-week strike of refuse workers and street cleaners employed by Leeds City Council; this was the longest strike in the GMB's history. He also ran the \\"End Foul Pay\\" campaign for football clubs to pay ground staff higher wages. Roache was elected as General Secretary and Treasurer of the GMB in November 2015, receiving 56.7% of the vote on a turnout of 4.2%, beating the one other candidate, Paul McCarthy. Roache took up the post in 2016. He was re-elected in 2019 with 61% of the vote. In April 2020 Roache resigned suddenly, on the grounds of ill health, amid reports he had been forced to resign. A GMB statement said Roache's chronic fatigue syndrome illness some years ago had restarted and he resigned following medical advice. The Guardian reported that an internal GMB inquiry had recently started into anonymous personal and detailed allegations made against Roache. Other interests Alongside his role in the GMB, Roache was the chair of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS) and also of the Yorkshire and Humber Trades Union Congress. Some reports suggested he was supportive of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party and had criticised the 2015 Labour manifesto drawn up under Ed Miliband, though other reports state he was not an enthusiastic backer, or a critic, of Corbyn.

He is the vocalist, guitarist and songwriter for the bands Gesu no Kiwami Otome, Indigo la End, Genie High, the instrumental band Ichikoro, and also works as a songwriter for other musicians.  Biography  Kawatani grew to like music when he was eight years old, when he heard T.M.Revolution's song \\"High Pressure\\" (1997). He began composing music while he was a university student at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. There, he met Masao Wada at the light music club (currently known as Gesu no Kiwami Otome's bassist Ky≈´jitsu Kach≈ç). In April 2009, Kawatani formed the band Indigo la End, mostly performing live performances in the Shinjuku, Shimokitazawa and Shibuya areas of Tokyo. Indigo la End released their debut extended play Say≈çnara, Subarashii Sekai in April 2012, though the independent label Space Shower Music. In May 2012, Kawatani asked members of other bands who played at the Shimokitazawa Era live house to form a musical project together, as a fun activity outside of their regular projects, and called this band Gesu no Kiwami Otome. Kawatani continued to release music with Indigo la End, with their second extended play Nagisa nite in September 2012 and their first album Yoru ni Mah≈ç o Kakerarete in February 2013. A month after their debut album, Gesu no Kiwami Otome also debuted through Space Shower Music, releasing the extended play Dress no Nugikata. In December 2013, both of Kawatani's bands were signed to Warner sub-label Unborde. Both musical units released their major label debut releases on April 2, 2014: Minna Normal for Gesu no Kiwami Otome and Ano Machi Record for Indigo la End. In August 2014, Gesu no Kiwami's song \\"Ry≈çkiteki na Kiss o Watashi ni Shite\\" was used as the drama Around 30-chan: Mush≈´sei's opening theme song and released as a single. It reached number four on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The band's debut album Miryoku ga Sugoi yo (2014) reached number four on Oricon's album charts, and their second, Ry≈çseibai (2016), reached number one, after several commercially successful singles released in 2015: \\"Watashi Igai Watashi ja Nai no\\", \\"Romance ga Ariamaru\\" and \\"Otonatic\\". In 2014, Kawatani composed songs for musicians outside of his two bands for the first time, when he gave the boyband SMAP two songs for their album Mr. S. Kawatani worked with the band again in 2015, on their single \\"Ai ga Tomaru made wa\\", and has also worked with Tomohisa Yamashita, and the girl group Team Syachihoko on their single \\"Shampoo Hat\\" (2014).  Personal life  Kawatani's real name is Kenta, though he has used the name Enon Kawatani since at least 2011. In Gesu no Kiwami Otome's early releases, Kawatani used the pseudonym MC.K. In January 2016, Sh≈´kan Bunshun magazine reported that Kawatani had gotten married in secret to a non-celebrity woman in mid-2015, and that Kawatani was suspected to be having an affair with television personality Becky. The article detailed leaked conversations between the pair from the messaging application Line. This led Becky to hold a press conference a day before the issue's release where she apologized for her conduct, and Kawatani to release an apology statement, in which he professed that he and Becky were merely close friends. In December 2015, Shin-Ei Animation had contacted Kawatani to ask him to write the theme song for the film Crayon Shin-chan: Fast Asleep! Dreaming World Big Assault! (2016), and for his band Gesu no Kiwami Otome to perform it. However, after the adultery allegations were published, Shin-Ei rescinded their offer.

Her admission to the use of a 'familiar spirit' and association with the fairies were the main cause of her conviction and her death sentence. For consistency the name 'Bessie Dunlop' is used throughout. Life and character Bessie was the wife of Andrew Jack of Lynn, Lyne, Lin or Linn a hamlet and the name of a glen through which the Caaf Water runs, lying in the Barony of Lynn, then owned by Robert, Master of Boyd, eldest son of Lord Boyd.Henderson, Page 14 It seems therefore that their farm lay near or at the bottom of the Lynn Glen on the Caaf Water, near Dalry in North Ayrshire, Scotland. She was married to Andrew Jack and her surname suggests an Ayrshire connection as the town of Dunlop in the old Cunninghame district lies in the nearby parish of Dunlop. She is recorded as driving cattle at one point and sheep are also mentioned together with a horse and a journey to Edinburgh and Leith with her husband to collect animal feed, so a small family farm is implied at the very least.Love, Page 107 Bessie also records a meeting at the 'Thorn of Dawmstarnik' which is probably Dalmusternock on the Kilmarnock to Glasgow road.Scott, Page 92 A kiln is mentioned on one of the visits of Thomas Reid to Bessie's house and it is possible that her husband was the miller at one of the mills in the Lynn Glen. She was called the 'goodwife' which was one step down from a laird and a miller's wife would have a right to that assignation.Henderson, Page 18Scott, Page 92 She was of child bearing age at the time of these events and had surviving children with another born during the four-year period that she knew Thomas Reid.Henderson, Page 11Henderson, Page 17 Her husband features very little in the story considering how often Thomas Reid is in her company, but very little evidence exists of any impropriety other than the breaking of relatively minor social conventions such as trying to tug her by her apron strings to encourage her to go to the elfhame. A John Jack is mentioned as the father of one of her patients.Scott, Page 93 Association with Thomas Reid and the Queen of Elfland Old Monkcastle and Monkcastle's home farm buildings in 1906 The entrance to the 'Elfhame' at Cleeve Cove in the Disk Water Glen =Thomas Reid= When Bessie Dunlop was accused of sorcery and witchcraft she answered her accusers that she received information on prophecies, the whereabouts of lost goods and the natural remedies from Thomas or Tom Reid, a former barony officer of Blair near Dalry who claimed to have been killed at the Battle of Pinkie some 29 years before in 1547.Chalmers, Page 70.Love, Page 137. She describes him in terms of an elderly, well dressed, honest and respectable man with a long grey beard who carried a white wand.Love, Page 137 Bessie revealed to her interrogators that she had \\"Never known him when he was alive\\",Henderson, Page 27 but had first met Thomas or Tom Reid circa 1572 whilst driving cattle to the common grazing between her own house and the yard or garden of Monkcastle and after a discussion he then disappeared through a hole in a wall or dyke at Monkcastle garden, apparently a hole too small for a living person to pass through.Chalmers, Page 71. Service records that he came out of a stone dyke, more than once, without reference to anything unusual.Service, p.194Service, p.195 On their first meeting she had been crying and at a total loss with worry for a cow had died, her new born sickly child, she was still weak from her child birth exertions and finally her husband was taken with 'land ill' and she did not expect him to live. It was at this point that they had first met when he approached her. It has been proposed from a number of lines of reasoning that Thomas Reid was actually a Catholic priest or an adherent to that faith, in hiding within the new Protestant regime. He seems to have known her for he greets her with Gude day, Bessie and uses the Catholic greeting Sancta Maria. When she tells him of her troubles he replies in a priest-like fashion first asking \\"Why must tho make such dole and weeping for any earthly thing?\\",Scott, Page 92 adding that she must have angered God by questioning him and his advice was to make amends to the Almighty.Scott, Page 92 He had expressed an opinion that the Reformation was not goodScott, Page 94 and when he tries unsuccessfully to draw her away from Christianity he oddly adds a comment about the faith she took at the font-stone.Scott, Page 92 The scene of their first meeting and his supposedly odd disappearance, Monkland or Monkcastle, was a former property of the abbots of Kilwinning AbbeyHay, Page 11 that may have afforded a good place to hide and had many small holes or gaps in garden walls, an ice house, the main dwelling and its cellars, etc. that could be seen as too small to squeeze through, especially as he was at some distance from her at the time.Love, Page 108 He himself said that he lived with the fairies in the Elfhame. Thomas Reid's death at the Battle of Pinkie is unconfirmed, but his employer, John Blair, did die at the battle.Henderson, Page 26 The evidence for Thomas Reid being a ghost is not overwhelming for he is abroad during the day, physically able to hold objects, tug on her apron and even handle fruit, etc. His passage through a narrow hole in a wall or dyke is ambiguous at best and others being unaware of his presence in her house when her husband is busy talking to three tailors is again a matter of opinion as to how this should be interpreted. She is forbidden to speak to him when others are present, such as in Dalry and Edinburgh. His dealings with the members of the 'Court of the Elves' is also open to interpretation as to who they really were. The regular visits she made on his behalf to his son and relativesScott, Page 93 adds to the general picture of a man in hiding constantly covering his tracks as does an odd incident when Bessie visits a survivor of the Battle of Pinkie with proof of who sent her but no clear reason for the visit.Scott, Page 93 =The Court of the Elfhame= The gable end of the Caaf Mill in Lynn Glen on the Caaf Water Bessie asked Thomas why she had been chosen as the recipient of his time, knowledge and advice, the answer was that he had been ordered to help her by the Queen of Elfland. It transpired that at the time of her recent labour a stout lady had come to her door seeking a drink and this was none other than the Queen herself.Henderson, Page 4 A drink had been provided and this element brings various tradition folklore aspects into the equation such as a changeling child as hers was sickly and both she and Thomas predicted its death as well as the recovery of her husband.Henderson, Page 20 Bessie once met Thomas at the 'Thorn of Dawmstarnik' (probably Dalmusternock Farm near Craufurdland CastleAyrshire, Sheet XVIII. Survey date: 1856 Publication date: 1860.) on the Glasgow to Kilmarnock road where he tried to persuade her to deny Christendom in return for living a 'life of luxury'. She turned him down flat and he left in disgust however he appeared again not long after at her home and this time he had eight women and four men from the Court of Elfland who hoped to persuade her to join them. Oddly Thomas had advised her not to speak and they left with a horrible howling hurricane-like sound.Scott, Page 92 They were dressed smartly and Thomas referred to them as 'good wights' or fairies.Scott, Page 92 Bessie on one occasion had tied up her horse near Edinburgh at Restalrig Loch when she became aware of a group of riders passing and vanishing into the lake. Thomas explained that these were the fairies on one of their \\"cavalcades upon earth.\\"Scott, Page 95 =The Elfhame of the Blair= A map of the Cleaves Cove - The Elfhame o'the Blair An interesting associated aspect of Bessie Dunlop's story is that the extensive limestone Cleeves Cove site, one of Ayrshire's greatest natural history sites, lies on the Dusk Water only a few miles from Lynn Glen and Monkcastle. As the barony officer to the Blair Thomas Reid would have known this area well. Tradition records that the caves were the \\"Elfhame o'the Blair\\" or the 'Elfhouse'Paterson, Page 140. and the locals at that time believed that these magical creatures had made this their abode within the many chamber containing stalactites and stalagmites.Dobie, Page 125. At Halloween it was said they would come riding out of the caves on horses that were the size of mice, their long yellow hair straming or tied in knots with crimps of gold. Their quaichs were acorn cups and they drank wine beneath the toadstools. Their cloths were green velvet and their arrows were made of moss-reed tipped with flint arrow heads that were dipped in hemlock poison. The bows were made from the rib bones of unbaptised babies who had been secretly buried in the shaws and glens.Service, Page 54 It is not known how old these 'Elfhame' traditions are however excavation shows that it was dwelt in by man and was used by Covenanters seeking a hiding place from the king's troops. Healing and other practices The veracity of Bessie's testimony at court will never be known for sure, however torture seems to have been used as Service records that a \\"witch doctor, a skeillie man, was fetched frae yont Glesco' to deal wi' the case\\".Service, p.196 He goes on to say that she stripped and a search made for the Devil's Mark and she was also \\"scored abune the breath\\",Service, p.196 that is being slashed with a knife above the mouth as a form of torture used on witchesService, p.244 and that other tortures may have been used.Service, p.197 She does not seem to have benefited financially from the help that she gave people although gifts of food are noted such as \\"a peck of meal and some cheese\\". Bessie had various clients from the aristocracy and merchant class, none of whom came to her assistance at her trial. The Laird of Stanely's wife, daughter of Lady Johnstone sought Bessie‚Äôs assistance when her daughter became ill and Bessie prepared a potion of strong ale, bolstered with ginger, cloves, aniseed and liquorice. Lady Kilbowie was suffering from a 'crooked leg' and Thomas this time advised that nothing could be done to help the elderly patient without making the condition worse. Lady Thirdpart in the barony of Renfrewshire involved Bessie in the search for gold coins stolen from her purse and indeed the money was found after Bessie named the thief.Henderson, Page 15 William Blair of the Strand in Dalry is an example of a person who received unsolicited advice. William Blair‚Äôs eldest daughter was due to be married to the Crawford Laird of Baidland. Bessie advised him of dire consequences if the marriage went ahead such as madness and suicide. The Laird of Baidland agreed to marry William Blair‚Äôs youngest daughter although the thoughts of the elder sister are not recorded.Henderson, Page 16 Bessie had some involvement in midwifery, disclosing that as usual she could do nothing for them without Thomas's assistance, specifically he gave her a green silk lace that she tied around her clients left arm in contact with the skin.Henderson, Page 17 She treated the children of John Jack and Wilson of Townhead with herbs and they recovered.Scott, Page 93 Events leading to the trial and execution An 1811 map showing Dalry, Monkcastle, the Blair, etc. Bessie's problems with the authorities seem to have started with the incident regarding the theft of a cloak belonging to a Hugh Scott. William Kyle, an Irvine burgess had come to her about this and after gaining a promise of him being discrete about her involvement she told him that the culprit was one Mally Boyd who had quickly made the cloak into a kirtle to disguise her actions. William Kyle dealt with this failure to recover the item by having Bessie arrested and confined in Irvine's tolbooth until released thanks to an influential acquaintance, James Blair.Scott, Page 93 James Jamieson and James Baird of Mains of Watterton asked for Bessie's help over the theft of plough- irons, of which two blacksmiths, Gabriel and George Black, were accused and the items were said to have been moved to their father‚Äôs house at Locharside. The Archbishop of Glasgow, James Boyd of Trochrig, was brought into the affair when the blacksmiths took official steps to try and repair their reputations. William Dougal, sheriff's officer, is also said to have taken a bribe of ¬£3 not to find the plough-irons.Scott, Page 93 Bessie's public profile had been growing and unwanted attention was focussing on her activities. She was now accused by person or persons unknown of \\"the using of sorcerie, witchcraft and incantatione, with invocation of spretis of the devill, continewand in familiarite with thame, at all sic tymes as sche thocht expedient, deling with charmes, and abusing pepill with devillisch craft of sorcerie foirsaid .. usit thie divers yeiris bypast\\".The Scotsman This was in 1576, thirteen years after Scotland had passed the Witchcraft Act.The Scotsman She was taken to the High Court of Justiciary in Dalkeith 20 September 1576 and on 8 November she was found guilty and sentenced to be strangled and then burntHenderson, Page 14 on Castle Hill in Edinburgh.Chalmers, Page 72.

Life Mead became a wealthy linen draper of Fenchurch Street in the City of London, and member of the Company of Merchant Taylors. He was captain of a train-band, before joining the Quakers in 1670. On 14 August of that year he was present at a crowded meeting in Gracechurch Street, at which William Penn was the preacher; both were arrested and committed to Newgate Gaol. Plaque at the Old Bailey The trial of Penn and Mead, at which they defended the right of free worship, began at the Old Bailey on 1 September 1670. They were accused of disturbing the peace by unlawfully assembling together by agreement, and pleaded not guilty. The jury pronounced on 5 September that Penn was not guilty of breaking the law, and that Mead was not guilty at all; but jury and prisoners were committed to Newgate. Penn's father, Sir William Penn, was stated by Gerard Croese to have paid fines to secure their release. A detailed account of the trial, under the title The People's Ancient and Just Liberties asserted, was published (London, 1670) by Penn and Mead, and it is also related at length by Joseph Besse in his Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers. The handling of the trial gave rise to Bushel's Case. Thomas Vere, the jury foreman, paid a fine and was released. Edward Bushel(l), one of a group of four jurors who disputed their treatment, successfully applied to the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus, and they were released, following a ruling by Sir John Vaughan. Mead later lived at Highgate, and entertained George Fox there in 1677. He held a leading position among the Quakers, and several times waited on the king with George Whitehead and others. He purchased about 1684 the estate of Goosehays (also Goosehayes, Gooses), in Hornchurch parish, Essex, where Fox was a visitor. He died at Goosehays 3 April 1713, aged 86, and was buried in the Friends' cemetery at Barking with a headstone. Works Mead wrote, with Whitehead and others, several vindications of \\"the people called Quakers\\". One of these was delivered to the House of Lords, 21 February 1701. Family Mead married and lost his first wife, Mary Lawrence, in 1679. A child, Jonathan, died in 1680. In 1681 Mead married Sarah Fell, fourth daughter of Thomas (died 1658) and Margaret Fell; Margaret married George Fox as her second husband. Sarah Fell was a preacher, Hebrew scholar, manager of the large household at Swarthmoor, and a correspondent of William Penn and Robert Barclay. She had been sought in marriage by Richard Lower, court physician, whose brother Thomas married her sister Mary. Sarah Fell obtained from the king in 1670 the order for the release of her mother (then Mrs. Fox) from prison, which she herself conveyed to Lancaster. She was the first clerk of the Lancashire Women's Quarterly Meeting, and before she left Swarthmoor drew up for her sisters Instructions how you may order the business in the Quarterly Women's Meeting Book. Her account-book of family expenditure and many letters were preserved in the Swarthmoor Manuscripts. She died at Goosehays, 9 June 1714, and was buried with her husband at Barking. To Nathaniel Mead, a lawyer and politician who was knighted, his \\"dear and onely child\\", Mead left by will his estates in London, Middlesex, Kent, Essex, and Surrey.

In 2012 Nuqat organised workshops, exhibitions and conferences under the heading The Lost City of Arabesque in both Kuwait and Dubai - the latter was produced in conjunction with the Dubai Culture and Arts Authority and Tashkeel and traced the route of traditional arts in Dubai to their modern counterparts. 2009: The First conference was conducted under the theme ‚ÄúNuqat Ala Al Huroof‚Äù meaning ‚Äúdotting the I‚Äôs‚Äù with 3 speakers, 3 workshops, and 80 participants over 2 days. 2010: A bigger conference under the theme of ‚ÄúVisual Pollution in the Arab World‚Äù was conducted with 12 speakers, 9 workshops and 200 participants over 3 days. 2012: Nuqat was invited by Dubai Design Days to conduct the conference in Dubai as part of their program in March. The conference brought about 26 speakers, 12 workshops, and 200 attendees over 5 days. The same conference was completed in Kuwait. A decision was made to keep Kuwait as the main base with the big conference and conduct several small activities in the GCC and MENA. 2013: Nuqat received the support of the Ministry of State for Youth Affairs and conduced the conference with 27 speakers, 12 workshops, and 750 attendees over 7 days under the theme of ‚ÄúExecuting Culture Shock.‚Äù 2014: The theme was on ‚ÄúThe Missing Link: Practicing the collective approach‚Äù. We asked speakers to tackle a challenging part of the creative process: collaboration. Nuqat got its license as a non- profit company.Nuqat partnered with LOUD Art in Saudi Arabia to produce a second edition of their ‚ÄúExecuting Culture Shock‚Äù program, which according to Nuqat ambassador Tala Saleh was a way to emphasize the ‚Äúcommunal framework‚Äù of Nuqat as an Arab organization.http://english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/art- and-culture/2014/07/12/Changing-face-of-Saudi-art-scene.html 2015: With the theme ‚ÄúThe Copy/Paste Syndrome‚Äù, the 7 days program tackled the idea of originality along with the upsides and downsides of copying. The conference became a program, engaging local and regional cultural organisations to conduct their own activities as part of the program. Also, this year witnessed the launch of Nuqat Junior, the children creative education program. 2016: In 2016, Nuqat ran the annual conference on ‚ÄòThe Seventh Sense: Powering the Creative Economy in the Middle East‚Äô. This NUQAT conference looked at the ways the seventh sense, i.e the mechanism of the human mind that produces new ideas, can develop innovation in the industries of the Arab world and beyond. Looking at the idea of alternative energy, we proposed that creativity should play a larger role in powering our economies as we move forward. During the conference, we ran our first ever round of Exploration Sessions on three aspects of the Creative Economy. These Exploration Sessions brought together various academics, professionals, intellectuals, creatives, designers and more to discuss a given topic of the Creative Economy. 2018: Nuqat presented a special edition two-day forum titled \\"The Human Capital: Investing in Creativity for Social Impact\\". The forum was present to the public talks and discussion panels exploring various delving deeper into the creative economy and stimulating the collective wisdom of our minds and souls for the progress of our communities. For the years of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 the Kuwait edition of the Nuqat conference was hosted in the Amricani Cultural Centre (Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah) and the Sadu House hosted the workshops.http://bazaar.town/the-missing-link-practicing-the-collective- approach/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/fifth-nuqat-creative-conference-kicks/ As for the 2018 forum, Nuqat looked elsewhere, and decided to take a different step concerning where the event would be held thus looked into the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre, the recently opened Culture House/Opera House in Kuwait, JACC provides a space for dialogue to share and showcase skills and knowledge, giving younger voices a forum in which to speak. The cultural centre is a platform for educational and cultural exchange; moreover, it functions as an influential entertainment and culture powerhouse and productive space for the region.https://www.jacc-kw.com/about-us/the-cultural- centre/ Cultural Programming Nuqat regularly organizes art and design competitions, film screenings, exhibitions and other cultural events. In conjunction with 29Letters, a type foundry based in Beirut, Nuqat hosted the first annual Hourouf competition in 2014. Hourouf aims to identify in its pool of applicants new bilingual type designs in Arabic and Latin. Amongst the films screened by Nuqat are Schehrezade‚Äôs Diary by Zeina Daccache and short films by Kuwaiti directors including Dinosaur by Meqdad Al Kout. = Conferences = Nuqat Conferences invite regional and international thought leaders to participate in a curated form of talks, panel discussions, workshops and cultural events that are open to the public. Each conference is meant to explore a central idea providing everyone with the opportunity to participate, learn and move forward with an empowering perspective shift that can potentially lead to positive changes in the MENA region. = Exploration Sessions (Nuqat On Tour) = In 2016, Nuqat ran the annual conference under the topic \\"Powering the Creative Economy\\". The seventh sense, that is the ability for the human mind to produce new ideas, was presented by bringing in different experiences on ways inspiration and creativity is sparked and nurtured across the word. The idea resonated strongly with our audiences and the force of the topic has pushed Nuqat to embark on a two-year research tour on the Middle East. Simultaneously, Nuqat held a pilot series of Exploration Sessions in 2016 which looked at the following three topics: \\"Architecture and Urbanism\\", \\"Design Deficit in the Gulf\\" and \\"Funding the Creative Economy\\". These sessions bought together architects, academics, artists, writers, investors, designers and innovative thinkers to stimulate conversation and create a multi-dimensional understanding of the prevalent issues within three different fields. Following from this analysis, actionable steps were outlined and published in a report by Nuqat. The Nuqat on Tour Logo Educational Programs = Workshops = Since 2009 Nuqat has offered dozens of workshopshttp://nuqat.me/en/nuqat-events in a variety of practical and theoretical art and design subjects. Studio Nuqat is a series of workshops and events offered by Nuqat. Nuqat provides skills building and industry immersion opportunities for teams and individuals (including students, professionals and hobbyists). The objective of Studio Nuqat is to provide a creative outlet that in turn serves to develop the creative capacities, vocational skills and networks of its participants. Studio Nuqat serves as a form of alternative learning as well as a continuing education platform. Nuqat's street art workshop have led to public art interventions in Mubarakiya district and on the Sheraton roundabout at the heart of Kuwait City. Nuqat is currently offering a course series in photography, design and entrepreneurship. = Zain-Nuqat IN‚Ä¢DIG‚Ä¢GO = In 2017, Nuqat went into partnership with Zain Group, the leading mobile telecom innovator in eight markets across the Middle East and Africa. Together, the two organisations are set to introduce a development initiative dubbed IN‚Ä¢DIG‚Ä¢GO, which is an alternative thematic-based educational program for children between the ages of 6 and 11 years. The program is aimed at strengthening the understanding of the participants, expanding their knowledge, and developing their soft and learning skills. The program is the first-of-its-kinds in the region and will be initially launched as a pilot supporting children of Zain employees in Kuwait. This pilot will act as a learning platform for all stakeholders and then after the intention is to roll out the program on a larger scale. thumb240x240px In.Dig.Go Kids with the Team The collaboration is a result of the shared belief between Zain and Nuqat that an educational program capable of equipping future generations with skills and methodologies necessary to face the challenges that lie ahead is pivotal. Nuqat is overseeing the development and coordinating the implementation of the program with a group of creative professionals who will be supported by school teachers from different backgrounds and subjects. Together, they will craft the program with the creative professionals instructing the course. The 4Cs (Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity). This is done through contextual and theme-based learning workshops such as gardening, textile, furniture design, publishing, and much more. Hussa Al Humaidhi, Knowledge Director of Nuqat, commented about IN‚Ä¢DIG‚Ä¢GO, ‚ÄúCreative education sits at the core of what we do as an organisation. Nuqat is thankful and honoured to work with Zain on this exciting pilot program. Our beliefs are strongly aligned that only through equipping our future generations with the right skill-set and ambition, will we be able to progress as a community and as a nation.‚Äù Partnerships Nuqat workshops have received many different sponsors. In 2014 Jazeera Airways and IKEA provided materials and support for workshops in which participants created design solutions for the airlines and the furniture giant. In 2015, Alghanim industries sponsored Dr. Amar Behbehani's workshop 'Innovative Entrepreneurship: A Creative Process' and Elevation Burger sponsored Wajha's workshop 'Social Design  Fi Al Wajha' as well as Liane Al Ghusain and Wakim Zeidan's workshop 'Social Media Writing'.

Along with the Day of the Sun, the birthday of his father Kim Il-sung, it is the most important public holiday in the country. Kim Jong-il was born in 1941 (Juche 30) in the Soviet Union, although North Korean propaganda insists on the date 16 February 1942 (Juche 31) and places the birth at the Mount Paektu area in Korea. His birthday became an official holiday in 1982 when he began his work in the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea. During his lifetime, he kept out of the public eye during his birthdays. In 2012, the year following his death, the holiday was renamed the Day of the Shining Star. The most lavish observances take place in the capital Pyongyang and include mass gymnastics, music performances, fireworks displays, military demonstrations, and mass dancing parties. The North Korean people receive more food rations and electricity than usual on the Day of the Shining Star. Background According to North Korean propaganda, Kim Jong-il was born in a secret camp at Mount Paektu on 16 February 1942. Kim Jong-il was born in February 1941 to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-suk in Siberia in the Russian Federal Republic, Soviet Union where his father had been in exile because of his guerrilla activities. North Korean propaganda, however, dates Kim Jong- il's birth to 16 February 1942 and locates it at the Mount Paektu area in Korea, the mythical place of origin of the Korean people, where Kim Il-sung supposedly ran a guerrilla camp. In reality, the guerrillas were based in Manchuria at the time and Kim himself had been to the Soviet Far East before and after Kim Jong-il's birth. In North Korean propaganda, Kim Jong-il is often associated with the image of the star. He is most often referred to as the \\"bright star\\", although the \\"shining star\\" () is also used. According to legend, a bright star appeared on the sky the night he was born, and guerrilla fighters carved messages on trees proclaiming: \\"Three Heroes Shining in Korea with the Spirit of Mount Paekdu: Kim Il Sung, Kim Ch≈èng-suk, and Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng ('The Bright Star')\\" and \\"Oh! Korea! The Paekdu Star Was Born!\\" History Kim's birthday had been provisionally celebrated from 1976 on, but it became a national holiday only in 1982, two days after he became a member of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea. When he ascended to the leadership of the country, his birthday was marked as \\"The Spring of Humanity\\" on the North Korean calendar. During his lifetime, though, Kim shunned away from public occasions during his birthdays. The anniversary got its present name in 2012, the year following his death, when the Politburo announced that: \\"February 16, the greatest auspicious holiday of the nation when the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il was born, will be instituted as the Day of the Shining Star\\". An equestrian statue with Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung was revealed to commemorate the day. On 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test a few days before the Day of the Shining Star in celebration of it. Celebration Film director Vitaly Mansky at the Mansu Hill Grand Monument around the Day of the Shining Star The holiday begins on 16 February and lasts for two days. Celebrations are observed throughout the country. The capital, Pyongyang, has observances such as mass gymnastics, music performances, fireworks displays, military demonstrations, and mass dancing parties. Boulevards are lined up with flags and banners. Millions of people visit the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il lay in state. Exhibitions of the orchid Kimjongilia take place. The orchid is named after Kim and has been cultivated to bloom around the Day of the Shining Star. Outside of Pyongyang, commemorations are not as lavish. The North Korean government often allocates more food and energy to the people on Day of the Shining Star than normally. Children are given candy, and it is one of the few occasions on which new members are admitted in the Korean Children's Union. Vitaly Mansky's 2015 documentary film Under the Sun chronicles the run up to such a ceremony on the Day of the Shining Star. Government and business offices, banks, and retail close for the Day of the Shining Star. Weddings are commonly held on the Day of the Shining Star. The two-month period between the Day of the Shining Star and the Day of the Sun is known as the Loyalty Festival Period and festivities occur throughout. On the calendar, the Day of the Shining Star takes place after the Generalissimo Day (14 February, commemorating Kim Jong-il's accession to the rank of Taewonsu) and before the International Women's Day (8 March). The Day of the Shining Star is one of three days celebrating Kim Jong-il on the calendar, the other two being the Generalissimo Day and the Day of Songun (25 August, commemorating the beginning of Kim's Songun, or army-first, leadership).

Foulis and M. Bennett to serve as a framework for unsharp measurements in quantum mechanics.D. Foulis and M. Bennett. \\"Effect algebras and unsharp quantum logics\\", Found. Phys., 24(10):1331‚Äì1352, 1994. An effect algebra consists of an underlying set A equipped with a partial binary operation ‚äû, a unary operation (‚àí)‚ä•, and two special elements 0, 1 such that the following relationships hold:Frank Roumen, \\"Cohomology of effect algebras\\" * The binary operation is commutative: if a ‚äû b is defined, then so is b ‚äû a, and they are equal. * The binary operation is associative: if a ‚äû b and (a ‚äû b) ‚äû c are defined, then so are b ‚äû c and a ‚äû (b ‚äû c), and (a ‚äû b) ‚äû c = a ‚äû (b ‚äû c). * The zero element behaves as expected: 0 ‚äû a is always defined and equals a. * The unary operation is an orthocomplementation: for each a ‚àà A, a‚ä• is the unique element of A for which a ‚äû a‚ä• = 1. * A zero-one law holds: if a ‚äû 1 is defined, then a = 0. Every effect algebra carries a natural order: define a ‚â§ b if and only if there exists an element c such that exists and is equal to b. The defining axioms of effect algebras guarantee that ‚â§ is a partial order.  Examples  The motivating example of an effect algebra is the set of effects on a unital C*-algebra: the elements a\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{A} satisfying 0\\\\leq a \\\\leq 1. The addition operation on a,b\\\\in[0,1]_{\\\\mathfrak{A}} is defined when a+b\\\\leq 1 and then a‚äûb = a+b. The involution is given by a^\\\\perp = 1-a. Other examples include any orthomodular poset (and thus any Boolean algebra).  Types of effect algebras  There are various types of effect algebras that have been studied. * Interval effect algebras that arise as an interval [0,u]_G of some ordered Abelian group G. * Convex effect algebras have an action of the real unit interval [0,1] on the algebra. A representation theorem of Gudder shows that these all arise as an interval effect algebra of a real ordered vector space. * Lattice effect algebras where the order structure forms a lattice. * Effect algebras satisfying the Riesz decomposition property. * An MV-algebra is precisely a lattice effect algebra with the Riesz decomposition property. * Sequential effect algebras have an additional sequential product operation that models the L√ºders product on a C*-algebra. * Effect monoids are the monoids in the category of effect algebras. They are effect algebras that have an additional associative unital distributive multiplication operation.

He was a Union Army officer in the American Civil War, served as a judge of the Milwaukee Superior Court, and held several local offices in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. Early life and education Born in Burlington, New York, Sutherland's parents died when he was young. From age seven, he was homeless and drifted between various guardians until age 10, when he went to live with his older brother, Andrew, who was a teacher in Norwich, Connecticut. Andrew was able to give his brother an education, and together they traveled to Waukau, Wisconsin, in 1855. After leaving school, George returned to New York. He taught school there for two years while attending West Westfield Academy. Civil War service In September 1862, Sutherland enlisted for service with the Union Army in the American Civil War. He was enrolled in Company A, 1st New York Light Artillery Battalion. They were sent to the defense of Washington, D.C., but did not see combat. During 1863, they were dispatched to Philadelphia and Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to restore order in the midst of draft riots. Sutherland was unhappy with this form of service, so that year obtained permission to attend the Philadelphia Military School, where they were training officers to command \\"colored\\" regiments. He received a commission as a captain on July 23, 1864, and was sent to Kentucky to raise volunteers for the 13th U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery Regiment. While working in Kentucky, he was engaged in fighting at Eddyville, Kentucky, was shot in the arm and captured by the enemy. He was able to escape with the help of a woman, but after arriving at the Union hospital in Clarksville, Tennessee, he became sick with Typhoid fever. He was hospitalized for three months, then returned to service on the staff of the court martial at Lexington, Kentucky, where he remained until mustering out of the service in November 1865. Legal and political career After the war, Sutherland returned to school. First at Ripon College, then Amherst College, where he graduated in 1870. He studied law with Judge Willard, in Utica, New York, and completed his legal education in 1871 at Columbia Law School. He was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin in 1871 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and entered private practice in Ripon, Wisconsin. In 1872, he became City Attorney in Ripon and also served on the Fond du Lac County Board of Supervisors. In 1874, he moved to the city of Fond du Lac, and partnered with Judge David Taylor until he was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1878. In 1879, Sutherland was elected to represent Fond du Lac County in the Wisconsin State Senate on the Republican Party ticket. He also served as postmaster for Fond du Lac from 1883 to 1885, but was removed by President Grover Cleveland for \\"offensive partisanship.\\" Sutherland moved to Milwaukee in 1886, and, in 1897, was elected judge of the Milwaukee Superior Court, defeating incumbent Judge Robert N. Austin. He served for two years before his death in 1899. Personal life and family Sutherland married Adela Merrell at Kirkland, New York, May 3, 1871. They had at least two daughters together. Sutherland was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Grand Army of the Republic. Sutherland died suddenly of heart disease in Chicago, Illinois, while coming home from a foreign trip.

History The zoo first opened on September 28, 1993. Since 2004, the zoo's black swans have been engaged in a commensal relationship with the koi found in the zoo's waters. The swans had originally begun dipping their food pellets into the water to moisten the texture, and as a result, the koi learned to swim up to the swans and eat the pellets. In November 2011, Chinese state tabloid The Global Times reported that the park's management had sent requests to other Chinese zoos, asking for respective mates to be delivered for a ruffed lemur and a chimpanzee held in their zoo. On May 1, 2014, a lioness in the park gave birth to three cubs and neglected to care for them. Park workers had begun bottle-feeding the cubs in order to keep them nourished. A local pet store sent a Golden Retriever to care for the cubs, and the dog was accepted by the cubs as their surrogate mother on May 16. =Controversy= On October 2, 2014, a horse that was pulling tourists in a heavy carriage in the zoo, for the twelfth time that day, collapsed and died. The tourists, as well as some of the zoo's security guards, concluded that the horse's death was a result of overworking and malnourishment.

The indigenous Mangarayi and Yangman peoples know the tree as mirndir, the Ngarluma name it as malygan and Yindjibarndi peoples know the tree as majgan. It has smooth, powdery bark, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus leucophloia is a mallee or small tree that forms a lignotuber. It typically grows to a height of . Its new bark is pale pink to pale orange but matures to white and ages in patches to dark pink or grey. The trunk is often crooked and has a base diameter of around . The crown of the tree is usually as wide as the tree is tall and has a moderately dense canopy. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are glaucous, more or less square in cross-section with a wing on each corner, and leaves that are egg-shaped to more or less round, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull green to grey-green colour on both sides, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, sometimes up to eleven, on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded, blunt conical or shortly beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between March and August and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, barrel- shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim or prominently protruding, depending on subspecies. The seeds are yellow-brown and round or elliptical. Taxonomy Eucalyptus leucophloia was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1976 in the paper Six new taxa of Eucalyptus from Western Australia, published in the journal Nuytsia. The type specimen had been collected by Alex George in 1971 from around the Rudall River. The specific epithet (leucophloia) is derived from ancient Greek words (or word elements) meaning \\"white\\" and \\"-barked\\", in reference to the \\"strikingly white bark\\". In 2000, Ken Hill and Brooker described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus leucophloia subsp. euroa L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill has the valves of the fruit prominently protruding above the rim; * Eucalyptus leucophloia Brooker subsp. leucophloia has the valves of the fruit enclosed below the rim. Brooker placed E. leucophloia in Section Brevidoliae with E. rupestris, E. kenneallyi, E. umbrawarrensis, E. confluens, E. brevifolia and E. ordiana. Distribution Subspecies leucophloia is found in gullies and on hills and plains in the western Pilbara region of Western Australia where it grows in skeletal soils over sandstone. Subspecies euroa occurs in the central parts of the Northern Territory between Katherine, Tennant Creek and the southern part of Arnhem Land and into north western Queensland between Mount Isa, Cloncurry and Dajarra. It is found among low woodland communities it will often form pure stands over an understorey of Acacia shrubs and Triodia spinifex grasses. In a mixed woodland is often associated with Eucalyptus gamophylla, Corymbia terminalis and Eucalyptus odontocarpa.

He was a full Professor of Power Systems in the Department of Information Technology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, in 2010‚Äì2016 and is now emeritus. He is a Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (since 1992), Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (since 1994), the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (since 2015), and a Foreign Member of the US National Academy of Engineering (since 2016). As of February 2019, he has earned more than 25,000 citations and his h-index is 72 (Google Scholar).  Biography  G√∂ran Andersson earned his master's degree from Lund University in 1975 in the field of engineering physics. He finished his PhD studies at the same institute in mathematical physics, namely on the theory of rotational excitations in nuclei, in 1980.Dissertation von C. G√∂ran Andersson, Studies in the theory of rotational excitations in nuclei, Lund Universit√§t, URL: http://libris.kb.se/bib/217890 After his PhD studies, he worked as a research engineer at ASEA, now ABB, in the HVDC division from 1980‚Äì1985. In 1985, he became the Section Manager for Systems Engineering in the same division until 1986. During these years he was mostly researching on dynamics and control of power systems with a main focus on HVDC. After his time at ASEA, he became a professor at the Royal Institute of Technology at Stockholm. He was the head of the Institute for Electric Power Systems group from 1986 to 2000. His main research focus there was on dynamic stability issues in power systems. He graduated a total of 14 PhD students during his time at KTH, including Prof. Antonio Conejo (Ohio State University). In 2000, he moved to Switzerland where he became a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, where he is heading the Power Systems Laboratory. G√∂ran Andersson is married to Anne since 1975, and they have three children.  Research  His most recent research work can be divided into three major topics within the field of electric power systems: # Power System Dynamics and Control: he and his PhD students have studied how VSC-HVDC can be used in the European grid in order to enhance the stability. Other work aimed at investigating the pros and cons of HVDC grids. In this case the European grid was also used as test system. An important aspect considered in this work is the need of communication. As the European system connects a large number of countries, further work within this area focused on the operation of multi-area systems. The interaction between several transmission system operators, each with limited information of the status of neighboring systems, has been studied, and his group has proposed methods aiming at increasing the overall system security through exchange of selected pieces of information. Another important topic that has been covered by multiple PhD theses is the topic of demand response. His group has developed methods and tools to enable thermal loads to offer regulating and balancing power. This has resulted in the spin-off Adaptricity. A key reason why demand response has gained attention is because it can support the integration of variable renewable generation. Prof. G√∂ran Andersson's group has also looked at how in the situation with increased uncertainty, security assessment can be done and formulated as a stochastic program with chance constraints. But the work on security is not just purely focused on the physical aspects, he has also done work on cyber-security of SCADA systems. # Power Markets: The aim of the work in this field is to develop realistic models for liberalized power markets, particularly the ones in Europe. An important aspect is the modeling of energy prices, with the aim of forecasting these. The Hourly Price Forward Curve (HPFC) is an important tool in this context, and much work is devoted to this topic. An approach, combining statistical and fundamental models, has been implemented. The original HPFC was usable only for a single price area. His group has been developing it for several areas through the incorporation of market coupling mechanisms. Another application is the valuation of pumped hydro storage plants in the new market conditions. Non-linear learning techniques are used to better capture seasonal variations. # Future Energy Systems: Prof. Andersson's group initiated the development the Energy Hub concept around 2003. It is now used by many researchers and planners worldwide. The Energy Hub has been the basis for many projects concerning future energy systems, and the concept has been further developed and adapted for new applications. Additionally, the group has worked in a number of projects regarding the integration of electrical vehicles (EV) in power systems. Together with research groups in mechanical engineering and traffic planning, the researchers at the Power Systems Laboratory have developed a model that incorporates traffic flow simulation and energy consumption while driving, so that the state-of-charge for the individual vehicles can be determined. From this, control schemes for the charging of vehicles taking into account grid constraints, power prices, and the preferences of the vehicle owners have been designed. As another line of research which falls into the topic of future energy systems, the work on developing an expansion plan taking into account corrective control that can be accomplished by HVDC links should be mentioned. It was shown that this possibility could result in substantial savings. Another main contribution of the group concerned operational flexibility, which has gained in interest due to the integration of photovoltaic and wind power, which are fluctuating. A special modeling framework, the Power Node model, was developed for this purpose. The Power Node is related to the Energy Hub and can be seen as a complement.

However, Meredith attempts to take charge and conflicts with her on a case. After several arguments, Maggie tells Meredith that she is her half-sister. Meredith, in disbelief, points out that she would know that her mother would be pregnant when she was five years old, as Maggie is five years younger than she. Meredith works with Alex Karev to decide whether Maggie is lying or if she is wrong. They discover she is correct. Meredith gets flashes back to the time of her mother's crisis at five years old, and remembers being at a hospital and hearing a screaming baby. After several weeks, Webber admits to Maggie that he is her father. Maggie is angry at him. Later, when he comes to apologize for not being there as a father, Maggie corrects him and says he is not her father, as she has adoptive parents she loves, and that she is only angry because of his dishonesty and making her look foolish and naive for weeks. Derek and Meredith decide to have Maggie come over to their house for dinner, to get to know Maggie better. After Maggie says yes, Derek decides it is a good idea to ask Richard as well. Richard reluctantly agrees. The night of the dinner, Maggie and Richard show up, but no-one answers. Maggie leaves him after that. Maggie develops a relationship with radiologist, Ethan Boyd. She admits her awkwardness in relationships, having ended her previous engagement to Dean, who she was unable to sleep in the same bed with. Meredith ends up in a bind with no one to watch her kids, so Maggie offers to watch them. Richard and Maggie eventually come to good terms, and Maggie's helping with Meredith's kids help her integrate into her family home more. Maggie learns about the histories of Meredith, Alex and Callie Torres as they commemorate their dead friend, George O'Malley. After Derek's death, Meredith abandons Seattle for a year, leaving Maggie a note. Maggie is shocked by this, and admits she felt abandoned by Meredith right when they were starting to become a family. She invites Webber to a Christmas party, noticing his loneliness. Meredith eventually returns home, hugging Maggie and re- integrating into her old family home. While Maggie and her colleagues are busy dealing with Keith Gardner after a tunnel collapse, Maggie gets a phone call that her parents are getting a divorce. Her mother confesses to her that she'd been having an affair with their car serviceman for eleven years and they had only stayed together for her sake, but were getting a divorce now that she was out on her own. Maggie is emotional about this, but she doesn't want to bother her colleagues about it. Later, she confides in Meredith over the issue, but feels it is silly in comparison to her husband's death. Meredith, however, says she can tell her anything and she should come to her whenever she is having a problem. After Meredith buys her house back from Alex, she invites Maggie and Amelia Shepherd to move in with her. They assist Meredith in caring for her kids. Maggie also often mediates between Meredith and Amelia, who frequently get into fights over little things. She often helps with Meredith's three kids, with each \\"sister\\" in charge of getting one kid ready for the day. In the twelfth season, Maggie develops a relationship with intern Andrew DeLuca. Maggie and DeLuca keep their relationship private to avoid difficulties at work. DeLuca grows frustrated with their secrecy, so Maggie abruptly decides to go public. When this happens, DeLuca becomes uncomfortable with the way he is viewed by others because he is dating an attending, and doesn't want others to think he is getting special treatment. He also feels intimidated by her authority and ultimately ends things with her. Maggie attempts to move on and develops an interest in Nathan Riggs. However, she is unaware that Meredith has a sexual relationship with him. She confides in Meredith about her feelings at Amelia's wedding to Owen Hunt. In the thirteenth season, Maggie is hurt when she discovers that Meredith had been lying to her about Alex's actions assaulting DeLuca. She tells her to never lie to her again, but Meredith continues to hide her relationship with Riggs. Riggs tells Meredith that she needs to tell Maggie and Maggie works up the courage to ask Riggs out, but Meredith told him to say no. Maggie‚Äôs mother Diane also comes to the hospital and is treated by Jackson Avery for what turns out to be cancer. Before Diane succumbs to her illness, she encourages Maggie to live a fuller life outside of her career. Jackson is there for Maggie as she grieves, and the two grow closer. It isn‚Äôt until Jackson's ex- wife April Kepner points out their bond that Jackson and Maggie realize their feelings for one another. In the fourteenth season, Maggie and Jackson initially try to bury their feelings, but Jackson decides to pursue her. They eventually begin a romantic relationship and attend Alex and Jo Wilson's wedding together. Development =Casting and creation= On April 5, 2014, TVLine reported that Kelly McCreary best known for her series regular role on The CW's short lived medical drama Emily Owens, M.D. and recent guest appearances on Scandal had been cast in a guest star role. McCreary was slated to debut on the May 8, 2014 episode. On October 23, 2014, it was announced that McCreary was promoted to series regular after being credited as guest- starring until the eleventh episode. It was a couple of months after McCreary wrapped her stint on Scandal that she was invited to audition for Grey's. McCreary revealed that she originally auditioned for the character of \\"Claudette\\" with dummy sides, unbeknownst to her. The only information McCreary had about the character was \\"that she was adopted, that she would recur, and she was going to be a very important storyline.\\" Just before the script reading for the season 10 finale, Rhimes summoned McCreary to inform her of Maggie's true identity. \\"I was really psyched\\" McCreary revealed when Rhimes informed her of Maggie's lineage. \\"I felt really honored to be the one to accept the challenge.\\" However, it wasn't until McCreary experienced the reactions to Maggie's existence from her fellow cast mates that McCreary realized just how big of a deal the character would be. The character's potential existence was first referenced in the press in February 2009 when Michael Ausiello hinted at the possibility of Meredith having a half-sibling, the product of her mother's affair with Richard. Initial speculation pointed to Jesse Williams' Jackson Avery as the child, but the actor refuted those rumors. Shonda Rhimes revealed that the character had always been a part of the original story plans, but the character's existence was not set in stone until season 4. =Characterization= Kelly McCreary expressed her excitement about how special Maggie in an interview with BuddyTV. \\"I just feel like it's a rare opportunity to be able to play somebody that is so complex and fully realized and smart and fierce and compassionate and awkward and the whole thing.\\" Maggie is very good at her job so she can find a place in a professional capacity, but in her personal life, she \\"gets more than she bargained for\\" McCreary said. \\"I think she's a really good doctor\\" McCreary said of Maggie. \\"She's obviously super-bright. She's very young to be as high in her field as she is.\\" McCreary further described Maggie as a \\"really great problem-solver.\\" Maggie is \\"very compassionate\\" and at the same time can \\"keep a clear head and do the right thing medically all the time.\\" McCreary further described Maggie as \\"so dynamic.\\" While Maggie initially \\"came across as all business,\\" Kelly McCreary relishes in playing \\"Maggie's neurotic, existential, meltdown side.\\" \\"Maggie also won't really back down from a fight; she's very decisive.\\" = Introduction = Kate Aurthur noted that until Maggie's introduction, Grey's was not \\"known for dropping in stories that it planted seasons before  it's never been filled with twisty mythology.\\" Rhimes insisted that the timing wasn't right for Maggie's introduction in previous seasons. In season 3, the series introduced Meredith's paternal half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) and it was at that time that Maggie became a serious topic of discussion. Though Lexie was killed off in the season 8 finale, \\"Flight,\\" Rhimes felt it was still too soon for Maggie's arrival. The scribe even thought the show might end without the character ever being introduced. \\"Then we hit this moment in time and I remember walking into the writers' room and going, 'You guys, it's time.'\\" When Maggie makes the sudden revelation that she is Ellis' child to Richard, viewers are left to wonder about her history. The second episode of the season puts Maggie front and center. The episode appropriately titled \\"Puzzle With a Piece Missing,\\" focuses on Maggie's struggle to fit in throughout her life, even with her own adoptive parents whom she is very different from. Though she is very close with her parents, and they get along very well, she's grown up \\"still feeling like something's missing.\\" Kelly McCreary said \\"That's what's really compelling to me about Maggie: that sort of dark underbelly of this person who seems to really have it all together.\\" Maggie struggles to build relationships with her colleagues. She unknowingly shares confidential information about Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and she gets she also insults the hospital board when she tries to prop up Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). Though she's got the \\"best intentions,\\" things backfire. Maggie also serves as a \\"mentor\\" to Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington). As Maggie discovers she has several things in common with Richard, the stage is set for Maggie to learn that Richard is her father. \\"I think people will relate to the awkwardness of being the new kid at school\\" McCreary said of the episode's comedic tone. Despite so many different interactions, the episode highlights \\"Maggie's loneliness.\\" The Maggie-centric episode also featured Kelly McCreary stepping into the coveted role of narrator for the episode, which was usually reserved for Ellen Pompeo's Meredith, and on occasion other veteran cast members. \\"It was overwhelming and very surprising\\" McCreary said of being the center of attention so early into her Grey's tenure. She continued, \\"I felt terrified and also really grateful that they trusted me with the institution about of Grey's Anatomy for a whole episode.\\" McCreary relished in finally learning the character's history. \\"[It] was a huge gift to have 65 pages worth of material telling me exactly who she is. It was great!\\" Reception Critics responded positively to the development of Pierce in her centric episode \\"Puzzle With a Piece Missing\\". Fempop gave a largely positive review writing, \\"Puzzle With a Piece Missing is a funny and insightful look both into this latest interloper and the established characters of Grey‚Äôs.\\" praising the new addition, \\"Thankfully she‚Äôs (Pierce) her own person, confident and happy to bring the thunder and put everyone, from interns to the chief of surgery, into their places.\\" Entertainment Weekly lauded the episode stating, \\"Coming into the second week without Cristina Yang, Grey‚Äôs was smart to focus all of its attention on the newcomer. With most other main characters only making occasional cameos, it made it more difficult to feel Yang‚Äôs absence. And by showing Maggie‚Äôs side of the story, it made her more relatable. It was a win-win.\\" adding on McCreary's character, \\" this episode is about how Maggie is her own, very likable person.\\" On her character TV Fanatic wrote, Overall, we got to know Maggie a little better and it's nice to see that she's made some friends. It was a fair episode that showed Maggie's basically a work in progress. Maybe she'll grow on us eventually.\\" For the thirteenth season, Vulture writer, Maggie Fremont spoke positively about the character: \\"It‚Äôs never easy for a long-running series to introduce a new character, especially when that character is meant to immediately fit in with the rest of the ensemble. But when Maggie Pierce arrived in season ten, that‚Äôs exactly what Grey‚Äôs Anatomy did. It could‚Äôve been easy to dislike her ‚Äî she showed up to take over cardio as Cristina Yang was leaving, for chrissakes! She was yet another one of Meredith‚Äôs long-lost sisters. The cards were really stacked against Maggie Pierce. Yet, thanks to the writers and Kelly McCreary‚Äôs terrific performance, Maggie was immediately endearing. She is weird and neurotic and cheerful. She is nothing like Cristina, but she fills a void that Meredith needs filled in order to function. Can you really imagine Grey‚Äôs without Maggie Pierce?\\"  References   External links  *Maggie Piece at ABC.com * Maggie Pierce on IMDb Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional characters from Seattle Category:Fictional storytellers Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Fictional female doctors Category:Fictional cardiothoracic surgeons Category:Female characters in television Category:Crossover characters in television ","title":"Maggie Pierce"},{"id":"49447853","text":"Anna Artamonova (born ) is a Russian female volleyball player.
