The specimens were found in rocks around 70 million years old dating from the Late Cretaceous of the Mesozoic Era. Coelosimilia is similar to modern-day scleractinians, except for the composition of its calcitic, non-aragonitic skeleton. It is the only known scleractinian so far to have an entirely calcitic skeleton. Coelosimilia is known from several specimens collected from carbonate Maastrichtian deposits located in the modern-day country of Poland. Together, these areas would have been the continental shelves of the Late Cretaceous European continent. Polish locations known to have produced specimens of the taxon include chalk-pits and quarries in Nasi≈Ç√≥w, Lubycza Kr√≥lewska and Mielnik. The specimens collected from these locations, identified as the ZPAL H.II series (6,7,8) are in the collections of the Paleobiological Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The discovery and analysis of Coelosimilia has changed the previous understanding of the evolution of the Scleractinia. Modern-day scleractinian corals have skeletons composed of aragonite, a calcitic mineral. Analysis of the skeleton of Coelosimilia does not seem to support development from aragonitic compounds. Instead, the skeleton is primarily calcitic  a type not ever seen in extant scleractinia. It is the first recorded instance of a scleractinian coral producing a non-aragonitic skeleton. Production of non- aragonitic skeletons by marine organisms, or the evolution of organisms capable thereof has been explained as a response to the ratio of the elements Magnesium (Mg) and Calcium (Ca) dissolved in seawater. Magnesium is a component of aragonite, and an abundance of the element is necessary for the development of aragonitic structure-building organisms. The presence of Coelosimilia during the Late Cretaceous has been suggested as an indicator of a low ratio (less than 2) of Mg to Ca in Cretaceous seas. In contrast, modern- day ratios of the two elements would be more than twice the suggested Cretaceous value, at a ratio of around 5.2. This has been used as an indicator of the shifts in the ratios of the two minerals in the oceans over the geologic time scale.

Biography Nassau Castle Sch√∂nau Abbey Rupert was a son of Dudo of Laurenburg (German: Dudo von Laurenburg) and the fourth of the seven daughters of count Louis I of Arnstein, possibly her name was Irmgardis or Demudis. Rupert is mentioned as count of Laurenburg between 1124 and 1152. He probably ruled together with his brother Arnold I. Rupert and Arnold built Nassau Castle around 1120. In 1124, Rupert became the Bishopric of Worms's Vogt over the Weilburg Diocese. He inherited this position from the Hessian Count Werner IV of Gr√∂ningen. Idstein, which had come under the control of Dudo in 1122, was also added to this fief. Through this, Rupert was able to decisively expand the possessions of his House. He gained, among other lands, the village of Dietkirchen and established himself in the Haiger Mark. Along with numerous property and lordship rights in the Westerwald and Dill River region, Weilburg's territory included the former K√∂nigshof Nassau, which had fallen to Weilburg in 914. This did not, however, settle the dispute with the Bishop of Worms over the legality of constructing Nassau Castle. Rupert had little luck in this dispute between his house and the Bishop of Worms over the sovereignty over Nassau Castle. He was excommunicated by Pope Eugene III.Sauer (1889). The dispute was settled through the intervention of the Archbishop of Trier in 1159, about five years after Rupert's death. In 1126, Rupert endowed the Benedictine Sch√∂nau Abbey near Lipporn. The land had already in 1117 been donated by Count Dudo to Schaffhausen Abbey for construction of a monastery. Under Rupert's rule, from 1126 to 1145, the Romanesque buildings were constructed, presumably including a three-nave basilica. The Abbey included both a monastery for monks and a convent for nuns. From 1141 until her death in 1164, the abbey convent would be the home of St. Elizabeth of Sch√∂nau. Rupert is mentioned in a charter from 1132 as Lord of Miehlen. Rupert is regularly mentioned on court days and the Imperial Diet of King Conrad III of Germany, for example during Christmas 1146 in Speyer, where Bernard of Clairvaux preached the crusade. Rupert often appears as witness in royal charters. Rupert had continual disputes with several of his neighbors. He was a loyal follower of the Hohenstaufen Emperors. He died before 13 May 1154. Marriage and children Rupert married before 1135, possibly , to Beatrix of Limburg (‚Ä† 12 July after 1164, still mentioned in 1165), daughter of Walram II the Pagan, Count of Limburg and Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Jutta of Guelders (daughter of Count Gerard I of Guelders). From this marriage the following children were born:Cawley. # Arnold II of Laurenburg (‚Ä† 1158/1159), mentioned as count of Laurenburg 1151‚Äì1158. # Rupert II of Laurenburg (‚Ä† ca. 1159), mentioned as count of Laurenburg 1154‚Äì1158. In a charter from 1148 a certain Gerhard of Laurenburg is mentioned, who quite possibly was a younger son of Rupert I, however his relationship does not appear in any charter.Some sources consider Gerhard, to be the son of Rupert I's brother, Arnold I. See: Family tree of the early House of Nassau, retrieved on 2009-01-22. However, Erich Brandenburg in his Die Nachkommen Karls des Gro√üen states that it is most likely that Gerhard was Rupert I's son, because Gerhard was the name of Beatrix of Limburg's maternal grandfather. See: Table 11, Page 23 and note on page 151, quoted at Genealogy of the Middle Ages , retrieved on 2009-01-23. No marriage is mentioned for this Gerhard.

It is native to North America, where it is native to eastern Canada, much of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It has also been noted as an introduced species in other regions, including parts of the United States outside its native range. In some areas, such as California, it is an occasional noxious weed. This species is a perennial herb growing tall with somewhat oval-shaped leaf blades long borne on petioles. Flowers occur in the leaf axils. The bell-shaped corolla is up to wide and is yellow with purplish markings around the center. The husk covering the berry is up to long with ten veins. There are two varieties:Physalis longifolia.

The fresh fruit \\"tastes like an effervescent, under-ripened strawberry\\", and the dried berry \\"tastes like a cross between a raisin and dried cranberry.\\" Native American groups used it for food. The Puebloan peoples called the fruits charoka and shuma charoka and ate them fresh or cooked. The Zuni people referred to the plant and its relative Physalis hederifolia as Ke‚Äôtsitokia, and probably used them in similar ways. Women grew it in household gardens. The tomato-flavored berry was boiled and ground with onion, coriander, and chilis to make a dish considered to be a delicacy. The fruit was also dried and mixed into flour for bread. Today the Zuni use the closely related common tomatillo (P. philadelphica) in a sauce recipe derived from the traditional dishes that used wild species. The var. subglabrata has been listed in government compendia of Louisiana restricted taxa believed to be hallucinogenic, but this is likely inaccurate.

The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The large, square rudder was hinged to the rear end of the fuselage, and extended below the ventral line of the fuselage. The inline engine was neatly cowled in, with the exhaust being collected together in a single stack that extended above the upper wing.

His two key hitting coaches growing up were Bob Molinaro, a family friend who is a former major leaguer and Eastern League manager, and Valencia's mother Mindy. =High school= Valencia played shortstop for four years for the Spanish River High School Sharks. He earned South Florida Sun-Sentinel All-County honors as a junior, and was named first team All-Palm Beach County three times and second-team All-State twice. As a junior in 2002 he was Offensive Player of the Year after hitting .430, and as a senior in 2003 he hit .575. College =UNC Greensboro= Although Valencia had dreamed of playing for the University of Miami, its baseball program did not recruit him, and instead he went to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, one of two teams that had offered him a full baseball scholarship. In his freshman year, Valencia played third base and batted .338 with a .527 slugging percentage and a team-leading 8 home runs. He was the 2004 Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, and was voted second-team All-Conference. =University of Miami= Homesick for Florida, Valencia sought to transfer to the University of Miami after his freshman year, even though it only offered him a modest scholarship. UNC-Greensboro initially agreed to release Valencia from his scholarship, but later refused, placing him in jeopardy of losing a year of college eligibility under NCAA Division I rules. He appealed to a university committee which ruled in his favor, allowing him to leave while preserving his eligibility. During his sophomore year, Valencia played first base for the University of Miami Hurricanes alongside then-third-baseman Ryan Braun. He hit .300 and drove in 63 runs while batting fifth in the lineup, and was named to the All-Regional Team. By his sophomore year of college, he had added 40 pounds. \\"It's night and day\\" from UNC-Greensboro, said Valencia. \\"It's awesome. It's what every Florida kid dreams of.

When Braun left to join the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system in 2005, Valencia replaced him at third base for his junior year, batting .324 with a .475 slugging percentage. Valencia hit .312 with 124 runs batted in (RBIs) in 122 games over two years with the Hurricanes, and played in the College World Series.

Description Males reach a body length of three to four millimeters, with females up to five mm. This species is very similar to Pseudeuophrys erratica, which is rarer and found below the bark of trees on forest fringes. As P. lanigera is mostly found inside buildings, adults can be found even in deep winter. It is better suited to the dry climate of modern concrete architecture than other salticids in the area like Salticus scenicus. Adults can be found the whole year. Pseudophrys lanigera.jpgmale Pseudeuophrys.lanigera.juvenile.1.jpg2mm long juvenile female Distribution P. lanigera is distributed in western and southern Europe, eastward to the Caucasus. In Germany this species is most often observed inside houses, or on the external walls of buildings, indicating it is synanthropic at least in some parts of its range. A first find in Romania was published in 2007, and in Poland the first find was in 1999. Originally this species was distributed in Southwest Europe, and was first found in Germany in the 1950s, where it is now found only in or near human dwellings. Biology P. lanigera has been observed feeding on booklice such as Liposcelis. Name The species name (lanigera) means wool-bearing; the genus name 'looking like' (pseud) 'good' (eu) 'eyebrows' (ophrys).

However, the teachings closely resemble those of evangelical doctrine. The Church holds a Thursday night Bible Study at 7:00pm and a Saturday night worship services at 6:00pm that includes Biblical teaching, food giveaways and live music. The Church also offers a kids' service for children and teen ministry earlier in the day. Discipleship homes The church has created and supports \\"discipleship homes,\\" or residential rehabilitation facilities for those who are drug addicted, in need or being released from jail. There is a home for battered women with children and women who are homeless. These homes are free of charge. Those who enter the discipleship program are not charged rent, but in exchange are taught the Bible daily, required to attend church services and work in different areas of the church. A 12-step Christian recovery program is taught in some of the facilities and offers free counseling through a partnership it has in the greater Richmond area.

ISRIC Wageningen, The Netherlands, 2001 is a soil with a light-coloured, coarse-textured, surface horizon that shows signs of periodic water stagnation and abruptly overlies a dense, slowly permeable subsoil with significantly more clay than the surface horizon. In the US Soil Classification of 1938 used the name Planosols, whereas its successor, the USDA soil taxonomy, includes most Planosols in the Great Groups Albaqualfs, Albaquults and Argialbolls. These soils are typically in seasonally waterlogged flat lands. They occur mainly in subtropical and temperate, semi-arid and subhumid regions. Planosols are formed mostly in clayey alluvial and colluvial deposits. Geological stratification and/or a pedogenetic process of destruction and removal of clay has resulted in the relatively coarse-textured, light-coloured surface soil abruptly overlying finer textured subsoil; impeded downward percolation of water causes temporarily reducing conditions with a stagnic colour pattern, at least close to the abrupt textural change. Planosols in their natural state support a sparse grass vegetation, often with scattered shrubs and trees that have shallow root systems that can cope with temporary waterlogging. Agricultural land use on is normally less intensive than that on most other soils under the same climate conditions. Vast areas of Planosols are used for extensive grazing. Wood production on Planosols is much lower than on other soils under the same conditions. In the temperate zone these soils are mainly in grass or planted to crops such as wheat and sugar beet. Yields are modest even on drained and deeply loosened soils. Root development on natural unmodified Planosols is hindered severely by oxygen deficiency in wet periods, dense subsoil and, in places, by toxic levels of Al in the rootzone. Planosols in Southeast Asia are widely planted with paddy rice. Other crops met with little success. Fertilizers are needed for good yields. In climates with long dry periods and short infrequent wet spells the best land use are grasslands. Strongly developed Planosols with a very silty or sandy surface soil are best left untouched. Planosols cover an estimated 130 million hectares of the world. Major areas with Planosols occur in subtropical and temperate regions with clear alternation of wet and dry seasons, as in South America (Uruguay, northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, the Brazilian pampa, the Pantanal mato-grossense and northeastern Brazil), Africa (Sahelian zone, East and Southern Africa), the east of the United States of America, Southeast Asia (Bangladesh and Thailand), and Australia.

The park is open daily except in winter, and an admission fee is charged. Visitors can see the animals roaming freely in a centuries-old botanical garden. History From 1662 until 1988, the garden was a private estate, with a ch√¢teau built in 1848 by the family of Freslon Freslonni√®re. It was acquired in 1884 by Casimir Jourde, whose grandson Paul became a wildlife painter and world traveler. In the 1930s Paul and his wife, H√©l√®ne Castori, having discovered a game reserve maintained by Khengarji III, Maharao of Kutch, decided to create an \\"animal paradise\\" at Branf√©r√© by letting exotic animals from around the world acclimatize to the property and roam free, creating a park where animals and humans could interact. In 1965 the park opened to the public after thirty years of development, and in 1988 it was bequeathed to the Fondation de France. Animals Today the park contains almost 1,000 animals representing nearly 150 species, including antelope, gibbons, hippopotamus, lemurs, llamas, prairie dogs, tapirs, wallaby, zebras, and yaks, as well as flamingos, parrots, pelicans, and storks, all set within landscapes of prairies, waterfalls, and small islands. Its grounds have displayed botanical plantings since the 18th century, and today contain about 70 species of trees and shrubs including araucaria, azaleas, camellias, laricio pines, rhododendrons, sequoia, and a 300-year-old weeping specimen listed as one of the remarkable trees in France.

History  The museum was first formed in 1954 when two separate institutions, the Egyptian Museum and the Cyprus Collection, were combined. The Egyptian Museum had been created in 1928 from artifacts collected in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century while the Cyprus Collection was the result of the excavations of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Cyprus collection in the museum is the largest outside Cyprus and of great scholarly value. A new gallery of Cypriote antiquities sponsored by the A.G. Leventis Foundation and designed by White Architects was opened in January 2009. Besides Egypt and Cyprus the museum also holds collections of Greek and Roman antiquities, near eastern antiquities from Shah Tepe, Luristan bronzes and Islamic art.

It first appeared in mid-January 1999, spreading through email and usenet. The worm installs itself and runs in the background of a victim's machine, without their knowledge. It is generally considered the first virus to propagate by email, and has served as a template for the creation of other self-propagating viruses. Happy99 has spread on multiple continents, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Significance Happy99 was described by Paul Oldfield as \\"the first virus to spread rapidly by email\\". In the Computer Security Handbook, Happy99 is referred to as \\"the first modern worm\\". Happy99 also served as a template for the creation of ExploreZip, another self-spreading virus. Spread The worm first appeared on 20 January 1999. Media reports of the worm started coming in from the United States and Europe, in addition to numerous complaints on newsgroups from users that had become infected with the worm. Asia Pulse reported 74 cases of the virus from Japan in February, and 181 cases were reported in March‚Äîa monthly record at the time. On 3 March 1999, a Tokyo job company accidentally sent 4000 copies of the virus to 30 universities in Japan. Dan Schrader of Trend Micro said that Happy99 was the single most commonly reported virus in their system for the month of March. A virus bulletin published in February 2000 reported that Happy99 caused reports of file-infecting malware to reach over 16% in April 1999. Sophos listed Happy99 among the top ten viruses reported in the year of 1999. Eric Chien, head of research at Symantec, reported that the worm was the second most reported virus in Europe for 2000. Marius Van Oers, a researcher for Network Associates, referred to Happy99 as \\"a global problem\\", saying that it was one of the most commonly reported viruses in 1999. When virus researcher Craig Schmugar posted a fix for the virus on his website, a million people downloaded it. Technical details The worm spreads through email attachments and usenet. When executed, animated fireworks and a \\"Happy New Year\\" message display. The worm modifies Winsock, a Windows communication library, to allow itself to spread. The worm then attaches itself automatically to all subsequent emails and newsgroup posts sent by a user. The worm modifies a registry key to automatically start itself when the computer is rebooted. In some cases, the program may cause several error messages to appear. The worm was written by a French virus writer known as \\"Spanska\\". Other than propagating itself, the worm does no further damage to an infected computer. The worm typically uses port 25 to spread, but uses port 119 if port 25 is not available. The executable of the worm is 10,000 bytes in size; a list of spammed newsgroups and mail addresses is stored on the infected hard drive. The worm spreads only if the Winsock library is not set to read-only.

Written and directed by BAFTA award-winning Dominic Savage, it stars Colin Firth, Robert Carlyle, David Oyelowo, Anne-Marie Duff and Emilia Fox, and explores aspects of poverty, race, inequality, homelessness, immigration and class in modern Britain by following the stories ‚Äì at times intertwining ‚Äì of several people living in London. Plot City banker Mark (Colin Firth) lives with his pregnant wife Laura (Emilia Fox) in a large house in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood. Although he has just made a fortune in a financial deal, Mark refuses to give money to a beggar in an underground station, but later regrets this behaviour and begins to feel guilty about his success and opulent lifestyle. Another day, he returns to find the homeless man and gives him 100 pounds. Mark then resolves to use his wealth to help the indigent and volunteer as an outreach worker. As the film develops, it becomes clear that his newfound concern for the poor is also a form of escapism from his materialistic wife, and that he feels trapped and frightened by his life. Robert (Robert Carlyle), a convicted murderer, is released from prison and moves into a hostel in Swiss Cottage. There he meets the pregnant Michelle (Anne-Marie Duff), who has been relocated with her young daughter by a social worker to protect them from her abusive husband. Robert and Michelle form an intriguing relationship, while Robert continues looking for his mother, whom he has not seen for many years. In the hostel also lives a Nigerian immigrant family ‚Äì journalist Yemi (David Oyelowo), his wife Itshe (Nikki Amuka-Bird) and their daughter. Yemi works as kitchen help in a restaurant and Itshe as a house cleaner. They desperately need to raise 5,000 pounds to bring Yemi's father from Nigeria to London, before the political gangs who forced them into emigrating kill him. Mark begins to collaborate with Sally (Julia Davis), the social worker who placed Michelle in the hostel, and helps to allot 17-year- old runaway Zoe (Nichola Burley) a room there. He soon becomes very close to the teenager. One night at the hostel, Zoe kisses him, but he rejects her advances and returns home to his wife, who seems distraught by his absences and is convinced that he is having an affair. Robert finds out that his mother died while he was in prison and breaks off his relationship with Michelle. Mark and Laura manage to settle their differences in a restaurant: he explains the reasons of his being away and apologizes for having been so cruel in his neglect. While driving home after the dinner out, Mark almost hits Robert, who is walking back to the hostel. Enraged by the near-accident, Robert follows them and stabs Mark to death when he comes to the door.

But as the project developed, director Dominic Savage decided to broaden his focus and deal with social inequality: \\"I knew then that one of the issues I really wanted to deal with was the extremes of difference in people's lives ‚Äì and, in a place like London, those extremes can be experienced within just a few streets. People can be in hugely different worlds but sharing the same space.\\" The working titles were London, The London Project and To Have and Have Not. The film was neither scripted nor rehearsed: all the actors had to improvise on set, a method Dominic Savage considers \\"the most organic way of making a film but also the most risky (...)\\".

The fair, which has become a model for other fairs across the country, brings over 300 renowned national and international authors exhibitors to a weeklong celebration of all things literary and includes pavilions for translation, comics, children, and young adults. The mission of Miami Book Fair International is to promote reading, encourage writing, and heighten an awareness of literacy and the literary arts in the city's multi- ethnic community. The eight-day book festival has draws hundreds of thousands of book lovers to downtown Miami each November for a festival of all things read and written. A collection of select book fair sessions, dating back to 2006, are available in audio and video format via Miami Dade College at iTunes U. History Miami Book Fair International, originally known as \\"Books by the Bay was founded in 1984 by Miami-Dade College Wolfson Campus President, Eduardo J. Padr√≥n, Books & Books owner, Mitchell Kaplan, Craig Pollock of BookWorks, as well as other local independent bookstore owners, in cooperation with the Miami-Dade Public Library System.

Community Partners and Sponsors =Florida Center for the Literary Arts (FCLA)= The now- parent organization of Miami Book Fair International, the Florida Center for the Literary Arts, serves both students and residents of Miami-Dade County. Discussion about the development and structure of the Center began in the late 1990s and involved Miami Dade College faculty and staff, members of the board of Miami Book Fair International, special advisors from the book industry and selected members of the community. Building on the success of Miami Book Fair International over the years, and the tremendously positive response of the community, the idea of a literary center was conceived to help advance the College's vast and diverse literary traditions. The College received a generous grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to create a permanent endowment for the Center. This support paved the way for a solid base for the Florida Center for the Literary Arts. Full programming began in January 2002. As a department of Miami Dade College, FCLA is an umbrella organization producing literary programming that embraces authors and writing, journalism, play and screen writing, reading and literacy, and the successful Miami Book Fair International. Outreach to the community consists of reading campaigns and book discussions, writing workshops, author presentations, panel discussions, master classes, and more. The Center collaborates with a number of cultural institutions and other partners in South Florida, and indeed throughout the State, to create innovative or theme based initiatives year- round. The creation of the Center is a reflection of Miami Dade College's commitment to inspire students, as well as to serve the community by promoting the craft and power of the written word. =Sponsors= Corporate sponsors, past and present, have included Florida Blue, Target, State Farm, Florida Power & Light, American Airlines, Pollo Tropical, Barefoot Wine, Comcast, and Coca-Cola. =Partners= Community partners have included Miami-Dade Public Schools.

Synopsis After reading a report that black pupils from inner city schools are being failed by the education system, IT consultant Joe (David Oyelowo) decides to become a teacher. Having secured himself a job at a school in South London, Joe uses a series of discriminatory methods to ensure black students are given extra tuition over their white contemporaries (targeting them for detention being one such method). When he is falsely accused of assaulting one of the pupils in his care (Charles Mnene), Joe is suspended from work pending an investigation. He appears on local radio where he defends himself against black rights activist Councillor Watts (Brian Bovell) who denounces Joe as \\"the embodiment of 21st century Britain [...] a Ku Klux Klanman with a black face\\". As a result of the broadcast, the community begins to turn against Joe and he loses his job. When he slips into a deep depression, Joe's marriage breaks up and he finds himself homeless. Following these events, Joe begins exhibiting apparent racism towards other black people. He soon, however, finds himself being taken in by the members of a local gospel church. He observes black society as a detached onlooker at first, mocking the apparent cultural differences he perceives from the perspective of his new 'white' persona. Through the charity he receives he manages to find gainful employment as a handyman and meets Heather (Nikki Amuka-Bird) who helps in his eventual rehabilitation into black society. As the play reaches its conclusion Joe's innocence in the mistreatment of the pupil is revealed. Having rediscovered his heritage, Joe comes to the realisation that race and cultural identity are merely a state of mind. Style and themes The play's title derives from the phrase shooting the messenger; it is told entirely from the perspective of the central character who frequently addresses the audience. His asides to camera do not serve a strict narrative function, but allow him to deliver his ruminations on black culture and society.

The awards are named in memory of the renowned British actor Ian Charleson, and are run by the Sunday Times newspaper and the National Theatre. The awards were established in 1990 after Charleson's death, and have been awarded annually since then. Sunday Times theatre critic John Peter (1938‚Äì2020) initiated the creation of the awards, particularly in memory of Charleson's extraordinary Hamlet, which he had performed shortly before his death.Peter, John. \\"Stairway to success\\".

The awards for the previous year's performances are presented the following year. The 2018 awards were presented on 13 May 2019, and the winner was Bally Gill.

The awards defined a classic play as one written prior to 1900; this cut-off was eventually extended to 1918. The awards are presented at a friendly, low-key private luncheon at one of the restaurants at the National Theatre. There is no filming and no outside press, and there are no acceptance speeches; the awards are attended however by Britain's theatre royalty, who take great interest in preserving the foundations of their profession.

It is located approximately west of Charing Cross. It is bordered by Kensington, Shepherd's Bush, Hammersmith, Holland Park and Brackenbury Village. The Brook Green neighbourhood takes its name after the recreational park space also named Brook Green, which runs from Shepherd's Bush Road to Hammersmith Road. The area is principally composed of tree-lined streets with Victorian townhouses and boasts a significant French and Italian expatriate community. Brook Green itself and adjacent streets are among the most prestigious and expensive residential addresses in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham due to their proximity to leading schools such as St Paul's Girls' School, Bute House Preparatory School for Girls, and Ecole Francaise Jacques Prevert. Brook Green has two main shopping areas, Shepherd's Bush Road and Blythe Road, the latter of which is home to a number of small, independent shops. Also tucked in behind the green is a large Tesco supermarket. Brook Green is also close to Kensington High Street, King Street and Westfield London. History Holy Trinity, Brook Green The name Brook Green is first recorded in 1493, and the hamlet was established by the 16th century. The area was developed as industrialisation spread out of London. Businesses in Brook Green included the Osram Lamp Factory, now converted into social housing, J. Lyons and Co. and its complex at Cadby Hall, and Post Office Savings Bank Headquarters in Blythe Road. Brook Green was also home to St Mary's College from 1850 to 1925, when the college moved to Strawberry Hill. Main building of St Paul's Girls' School St Paul's Girls' School, one of the leading independent schools in the country, has been situated on Brook Green since its foundation in 1904. The composer Gustav Holst was Director of Music at the school from 1905 to 1934, and in 1933 wrote Brook Green Suite for the school's junior orchestra. The Brook Green Hotel has stood at the western end of Brook Green since 1886. The original brook, which was covered over in the 19th century, still flows under the hotel. The area's inns ‚Äì the Brook Green Hotel and the Queen's Head ‚Äì were originally coach houses, and became popular entertainment venues. Today, the Brook Green Hotel is a pub on ground level, along with a cocktail bar in the basement below and a hotel upstairs. The Queen's Head overlooks the green itself at the front and has a garden at the back. Brook Green boasts four English Heritage blue plaques: they commemorate the artist Sir Frank Short, the composer Gustav Holst, the Silver Studio of design, and the writer Elizabeth Anne Finn (founder of the charity now known as Elizabeth Finn Care). There is also Brook Green Market and Kitchen, a FARMA certified farmers market in Addison Primary School.

Variadic templates are supported by C++ (since the C++11 standard), and the D programming language. C++ The variadic template feature of C++ was designed by Douglas Gregor and Jaakko J√§rvi and was later standardized in C++11. Prior to C++11, templates (classes and functions) could only take a fixed number of arguments, which had to be specified when a template was first declared. C++11 allows template definitions to take an arbitrary number of arguments of any type. template class tuple; // takes zero or more arguments The above template class will take any number of typenames as its template parameters. Here, an instance of the above template class is instantiated with three type arguments: tuple, std::map>> some_instance_name; The number of arguments can be zero, so will also work. If the variadic template should only allow a positive number of arguments, then this definition can be used: template class tuple; // takes one or more arguments Variadic templates may also apply to functions, thus not only providing a type-safe add-on to variadic functions (such as printf), but also allowing a function called with printf-like syntax to process non-trivial objects. template void printf(const std::string &str;_format, Params... parameters); The ellipsis (...) operator has two roles. When it occurs to the left of the name of a parameter, it declares a parameter pack. Using the parameter pack, the user can bind zero or more arguments to the variadic template parameters. Parameter packs can also be used for non-type parameters. By contrast, when the ellipsis operator occurs to the right of a template or function call argument, it unpacks the parameter packs into separate arguments, like the in the body of below. In practice, the use of an ellipsis operator in the code causes the whole expression that precedes the ellipsis to be repeated for every subsequent argument unpacked from the argument pack, with the expressions separated by commas. The use of variadic templates is often recursive. The variadic parameters themselves are not readily available to the implementation of a function or class. Therefore, the typical mechanism for defining something like a C++11 variadic replacement would be as follows: // base case void printf(const char *s) { while (*s) { if (*s  '%') { if (*(s + 1) != '%') ++s; else throw std::runtime_error(\\"invalid format string: missing arguments\\"); } std::cout << *s++; } } // recursive template void printf(const char *s, T value, Args... args) { while (*s) { if (*s  '%') { if (*(s + 1) != '%') { std::cout << value; s += 2; // only works on 2-character format strings ( %d, %f, etc ); fails with %5.4f printf(s, args...); // called even when *s is 0 but does nothing in that case (and ignores extra arguments) return; } ++s; } std::cout << *s++; } } This is a recursive template. Notice that the variadic template version of calls itself, or (in the event that is empty) calls the base case. There is no simple mechanism to iterate over the values of the variadic template. However, there are several ways to translate the argument pack into a single argument that can be evaluated separately for each parameter. Usually this will rely on function overloading, or ‚Äî if the function can simply pick one argument at a time ‚Äî using a dumb expansion marker: template inline void pass(Args&&...) {} which can be used as follows: template inline void expand(Args&&... args) { pass( some_function(args)... ); } expand(42, \\"answer\\", true); which will expand to something like: pass( some_function(arg1), some_function(arg2), some_function(arg3) etc... ); The use of this \\"pass\\" function is necessary, since the expansion of the argument pack proceeds by separating the function call arguments by commas, which are not equivalent to the comma operator. Therefore, will never work. Moreover, the solution above will only work when the return type of is not . Furthermore, the calls will be executed in an unspecified order, because the order of evaluation of function arguments is undefined. To avoid the unspecified order, brace-enclosed initializer lists can be used, which guarantee strict left-to-right order of evaluation. An initializer list requires a non- return type, but the comma operator can be used to yield for each expansion element. struct pass { template pass(T...) {} }; pass{(some_function(args), 1)...}; Instead of executing a function, a lambda expression may be specified and executed in place, which allows executing arbitrary sequences of statements in-place. pass{([&](){ std::cout << args << std::endl; }(), 1)...}; However, in this particular example, a lambda function is not necessary. A more ordinary expression can be used instead: pass{(std::cout << args << std::endl, 1)...}; Another way is to use overloading with \\"termination versions\\" of functions. This is more universal, but requires a bit more code and more effort to create. One function receives one argument of some type and the argument pack, whereas the other receives neither. (If both had the same list of initial parameters, the call would be ambiguous ‚Äî a variadic parameter pack alone cannot disambiguate a call.) For example: void func() {} // termination version template void func(const Arg1& arg1, const Args&&... args) { process( arg1 ); func(args...); // note: arg1 does not appear here! } If contains at least one argument, it will redirect to the second version ‚Äî a parameter pack can be empty, in which case it will simply redirect to the termination version, which will do nothing. Variadic templates can also be used in an exception specification, a base class list, or the initialization list of a constructor. For example, a class can specify the following: template class ClassName : public BaseClasses... { public: ClassName (BaseClasses&&... base_classes) : BaseClasses(base_classes)... {} }; The unpack operator will replicate the types for the base classes of , such that this class will be derived from each of the types passed in. Also, the constructor must take a reference to each base class, so as to initialize the base classes of . With regard to function templates, the variadic parameters can be forwarded. When combined with universal references (see above), this allows for perfect forwarding: template struct SharedPtrAllocator { template std::shared_ptr construct_with_shared_ptr(Args&&... params) { return std::shared_ptr(new TypeToConstruct(std::forward(params)...)); } }; This unpacks the argument list into the constructor of TypeToConstruct. The syntax perfectly forwards arguments as their proper types, even with regard to rvalue-ness, to the constructor. The unpack operator will propagate the forwarding syntax to each parameter. This particular factory function automatically wraps the allocated memory in a for a degree of safety with regard to memory leaks. Additionally, the number of arguments in a template parameter pack can be determined as follows: template struct SomeStruct { static const int size = sizeof...(Args); }; The expression will yield 2, while will give 0.  D  = Definition = The definition of variadic templates in D is similar to their C++ counterpart: template VariadicTemplate(Args...) { /* Body */ } Likewise, any argument can precede the argument list: template VariadicTemplate(T, string value, alias symbol, Args...) { /* Body */ } = Basic usage = Variadic arguments are very similar to constant array in their usage. They can be iterated upon, accessed by an index, have a property, and can be sliced. Operations are interpreted at compile time, which means operands can't be runtime value (such as function parameters). Anything which is known at compile time can be passed as a variadic arguments. It makes variadic arguments similar to template alias arguments, but more powerful, as they also accept basic types (char, short, int...). Here is an example that print the string representation of the variadic parameters. and produce equal results. static int s_int; struct Dummy {} void main() { pragma(msg, StringOf!(\\"Hello world\\", uint, Dummy, 42, s_int)); pragma(msg, StringOf2!(\\"Hello world\\", uint, Dummy, 42, s_int)); } template StringOf(Args...) { enum StringOf = Args[0].stringof ~ StringOf!(Args[1..$]); } template StringOf() { enum StringOf = \\"\\"; } template StringOf2(Args...) { static if (Args.length  0) enum StringOf2 = \\"\\"; else enum StringOf2 = Args[0].stringof ~ StringOf2!(Args[1..$]); } Outputs: \\"Hello world\\"uintDummy42s_int \\"Hello world\\"uintDummy42s_int = AliasSeq = Variadic templates are often used to create a sequence of aliases, named AliasSeq. The definition of an AliasSeq is actually very straightforward: alias AliasSeq(Args...) = Args; This structure allows one to manipulate a list of variadic arguments that will auto-expand. The arguments must either be symbols or values known at compile time. This includes values, types, functions or even non-specialized templates. This allows any operation you would expect: import std.meta; void main() { // Note: AliasSeq can't be modified, and an alias can't be rebound, so we'll need to define new names for our modifications. alias numbers = AliasSeq!(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6); // Slicing alias lastHalf = numbers[$ / 2 .. $]; static assert(lastHalf  AliasSeq!(4, 5, 6)); // AliasSeq auto expansion alias digits = AliasSeq!(0, numbers, 7, 8, 9); static assert(digits  AliasSeq!(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)); // std.meta provides templates to work with AliasSeq, such as anySatisfy, allSatisfy, staticMap, and Filter. alias evenNumbers = Filter!(isEven, digits); static assert(evenNumbers  AliasSeq!(0, 2, 4, 6, 8)); } template isEven(int number) { enum isEven = (0  (number % 2)); }  See also  For articles on variadic constructs other than templates * Variadic function * Variadic macro in the C preprocessor  References  External links *Working draft for the C++ language, January 16, 2012 *Variadic Templates in D language Computer programming Articles with example C++ code ","title":"Variadic template"},{"id":"21191350","text":"Gerard James Stokes (born 1955) is a New Zealand former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s, and coached in the 1980s through to the 2010s, who represented New Zealand.

It is produced as a collaboration between Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Astrosphere New Media Association. The individual episodes are written, recorded, and produced by people all around the world. The podcast had 3,000‚Äì10,000 listeners each day. History In 2008, astronomer Pamela Gay initiated brainstorming via e-mail on possible \\"new media\\" programs for 2009, the International Year of Astronomy (IYA). The discussion included Michael Koppelman from Slacker Astronomy, Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy, and others involved in the IYA. Their ideas were distilled down into the 365 Days Of Astronomy podcast. The podcast was to publish one episode per day over the entire year of 2009 and was originally planned to only run for that year. In 2013, the show evolved to add video. In 2015, it joined the UNESCO International Year of Light. In 2017, 365 Days of Astronomy became a production of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, when the CosmoQuest grant moved to the ASP and Pamela Gay became the Director of Technology and Citizen Science at the ASP. Production The intention is for individuals, schools, companies, and other organizations to record 5 to 10 minutes of audio for each episode. Contributors sign up for a particular day or for up to twelve episodes: one per month. Contributors include both professional and amateur astronomers as well as other scientists, historians, and others with an interest in astronomy. In the first three years of the project, contributors from every continent except Antarctica submitted episodes. Each episode has a common intro and outro that ties it to the overall theme. Avivah Yamani, project manager through 2012, was based in southeast Asia and expressed desire to encourage more diverse participants. The podcast's theme song, \\"Far\\", was written and recorded by George Hrab. A longer version of the song is available on his album Trebuchet, which was released in June 2010.

The McLean House near Appomattox, Virginia is within the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. The house was owned by Wilmer McLean and his wife Virginia near the end of the American Civil War. It served as the location of the surrender of the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee on April 9, 1865, after a nearby battle. The farm house represents the historical style of construction in Piedmont Virginia of the mid-nineteenth century. The building has a history of attempted preservation of disassembled parts. It was carefully deconstructed in the 1890s for shipment and display in Washington, D.C. but those plans fell through, and the materials remained on site. In the 1940s it ended up in the hands of the National Park Service and was reconstructed on its original foundation. The house was made available for public viewing in 1949. It was recorded in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures in 1989. History Lee Surrenders to Grant at Appomattox The McLean House was originally constructed by Charles Raine in 1848. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR Eliza D. Raine's estate sold the house to Wilmer McLean in 1863. It had formerly been a tavern (not to be confused with the nearby Clover Hill Tavern, which Raine had previously owned). One of the first battles of the American Civil War took place on the farm of Wilmer McLean at the Bull Run tributary, the First Battle of Bull Run (First Battle of Manassas). Soon after that battle the McLeans, seeking to avoid the war, moved to the village of Clover Hill, Virginia (the name of which was changed to \\"Appomattox Court House,\\" having just become the county seat). Because of the name of the village, many mistakenly think the surrender was signed in the courthouse building. (In years past, the county seats of many rural counties, especially in Virginia, had names that were simply the name of the county plus \\"Court House\\"; some of these remain today.) The courthouse is about from the Appomattox Station where the trains came into Appomattox, Virginia. Because the First Battle of Bull Run, fought on July 21, 1861, took place on Wilmer McLean's farm about to the north in Virginia, it can be said that the Civil War started in McLean's backyard in 1861 and ended in his parlor in 1865 (although neither event marked the true beginning or ending of hostilities). McLean was a retired major in the Virginia militia. He was too old to enlist at the outbreak of the Civil War and decided to move to get away from the Civil War. After the war, he would say of himself that he moved because he loved peace, but he made a small fortune running sugar through the Union blockade. He was also a slave owner, and there are slave quarters next to McLean's house. Nonetheless, in the morning of Palm Sunday April 9, 1865, the war came back to McLean when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant at his home. The terms of surrender were: \\"The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the government of the United States until properly exchanged, and each company or regimental commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands,\\"... neither \\"side arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage\\" to be surrendered; and, as many privates in the Confederate Army owned horses and mules, all horses and mules claimed by men in the Confederate Army to be left in their possession. The table and chairs used by Lee and Grant when negotiating the surrender are now part of the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, and the Chicago History Museum. After the surrender, many Union soldiers purchased some of McLean's furniture; however, some was stolen. McLean sold pictures of his house after the Civil War; however, he failed financially.  Preservation  Although he had made a considerable fortune smuggling sugar, McLean's money was in Confederate currency, which became worthless with the collapse of the Confederacy, and he was nearly ruined by the end of the war. In the fall of 1867 the McLeans left Appomattox Court House for Mrs. McLean's estate in Prince William County, Virginia. The banking house of Harrison, Goddin, and Apperson of Richmond, Virginia, obtained a judgment against Wilmer McLean when he defaulted on loans against the property. The house, by then known as the \\"Surrender House\\", was sold at public auction on November 29, 1869, and purchased by John L. Pascoe. Records show he then rented it to the Ragland family of Richmond, Virginia. The renter Nathaniel H. Ragland then purchased the property for $1,250 in 1872. After Nathaniel died in 1888, his widow Martha sold the property in 1891 for $10,000 to a Captain Myron Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York. Dunlap and some other investors who participated devised a few plans intending to capitalize on the historical significance of the property. One scheme they came up with was to move the disassembled house to Washington, D.C. to become a permanent display as a Civil War museum. There they would charge entrance fees to view the \\"surrender house\\" that ended the Civil War. They hired architects to measure drawings including elevations. They also hired contractors for materials specifications lists. The house was disassembled piece by piece and packed for shipping. At this point the investors involved ran out of money and legal problems came about. This scheme was never brought to fruition. The house became just a heaping piles of boards and bricks and sat prey to vandals, collectors, and the environment for fifty years. Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument was created by Congress on April 10, 1940. It included approximately at the village once known as Clover Hill. The meticulous reconstruction archeological work began at the site in 1941 amongst overgrown brushes and honeysuckle. One of the first steps was to collect historical data so architectural plans could be drawn up to work from. From the original materials salvable the project included some five thousand original bricks. The project came to an abrupt stop on December 7, 1941, with the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces. The United States entered into World War II. Bids for the reconstruction of the McLean House were reopened on November 25, 1947 and work continued. Eighty-four years after the historic surrender, reuniting the country, the McLean House was opened by the National Park Service for the first time to the public on April 9, 1949. In front of a crowd of approximately twenty thousand people a speech was given by Pulitzer Prize winning historian Douglas Southall Freeman. A ribbon was cut by the guests of honor at the dedication ceremony by Major General Ulysses S. Grant III and Robert E. Lee IV on April 16, 1950. The McLean House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. McLean House marker Elizabeth Bacon Custer's will of November 18, 1926, presented to the Probate court of New York City on May 11, 1933, stated: \\"...the two flags of truce, one made of a white towel and the other' of a white handkerchief, which were used on the occasion of the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox, and also a table on which the surrender of General Lee to General Grant was written.\\" The will further explained that these items were at the Memorial Hall of the War Department Building in Washington, D.C. A McLean house marker is at the front gate to the house. The inscription reads: Historical significance The McLean House has meaningful value because of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865. It also preserves the distinctive characteristics embodying the style and method of construction typical in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-nineteenth century as well as being typical of a county government seat of that time period. It also represents a typical farming community in Virginia of the mid- nineteenth century.

They were registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on October 15, 1966. National Park Service The tavern was built by two brothers as a stagecoach stop for the line they started in 1809 between Richmond and Lynchburg, Virginia. They had bought a farm at Clover Hill which was halfway between these town. It came with a small building that served as headquarters for their enterprise. This was expanded into a tavern and a guest house inn for travelers. It was a popular rest stop and prospered, eventually turning into a village. History The tavern originally opened in 1819 on the Richmond-Lynchburg Road for travelers and is the oldest original structure in the village of Appomattox Court House, with the exception of the Sweeney Prizery outside of the local of the village but within the Park. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR It became a popular rest stop and over-night lodging for the stagecoach travelers.Gutek, p. 299 The Clover Hill Tavern inn grew and farmhouses grew up around it soon after it opened. It was built by Alexander Patteson and his brother Lilburne Patteson as a stagecoach stop for the line between Cumberland County and Lynchburg. The Patteson brothers formed a partnership in 1809 to develop a stagecoach line between Richmond, Virginia, and Lynchburg. They purchased the farm acreage of Clover Hill in 1814, which was about halfway between these towns.Marvel, A Place Called Appomattox, p. 1-6 The land came with an existing small frame dwelling which they used as the headquarters for their stagecoach business.Brown, p. 121 There was much optimism after the War of 1812. The brothers made considerable money since there was a good economic boom starting in 1815. Clover Hill developed into a thriving commercial village with many people passing through into the \\"frontier states\\", such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana. Lilburne died in 1816. In 1819, Alexander built a -story, four-bay structure as his main residence for his large family. This also served as a tavern. Patteson also built a three-story tavern guest house to go with the tavern. The residence became the Clover Hill Tavern with the guest house converted into an additional dining room and additional guest rooms. The tavern was the residence of Captain John Raine and his wife Eliza in the 1840s. In 1839, the Raines purchased half interest in the tavern and the accompanying for $1,525 from the estate of Alexander Patteson, who died in 1836. In 1840, they purchased the other half interest of the property for the same price from the estate of Lilburne Patteson. The stagecoach was stopping twice every day at the tavern during the week and once during the weekend. In spite of this, through poor management of running the tavern business, he ultimately had to sell the property to his brother Hugh in 1842 for the balance of the overdue notes on the property. The 1840 U.S. Census of Prince Edward County shows the Raine family consisted of 10 children, seven boys and three girls. In 1845, when Appomattox County was established, a post office was formed and the original \\"court house\\" was built along with law offices and other government- related businesses. The village of \\"Clover Hill\\" changed its name to \\"Appomattox Court House\\". In 1846, Samuel D. McDearmon bought the Clover Hill Tavern. The village had approximately 150 people throughout the 1850s. In 1865, on Palm Sunday, the rapidly approaching end of the Civil War changed the prosperity of the Clover Hill Tavern with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant. The Generals arranged a meeting to be held in town at the McLean House so Lee could formally surrender his troops to Grant, effectively ending the American Civil War. Approximately thirty thousand paroles for the Confederate soldiers were printed in the Clover Hill Tavern. At the time of General Lee's surrender to Union commander Grant in 1865 the Tavern and its associated outbuildings were owned by Wilson Hix. Billy Hix, Wilson's son, was the sheriff of the village of Appomattox Court House then. Brigadier General George H. Sharpe, as head of the Bureau of Military Information and Assistant Provost Marshal, made the Clover Hill Tavern his headquarters starting on April 10, 1865. Sharpe was designated by Grant to oversee the printing of parole passes which were issued to the Confederate veterans. Research by historians of the Park reveal that perhaps the paroles were printed in the wooden dining room wing at the west end of the Tavern that no longer is there. The paroles allowed the surrendered Confederate soldiers to travel unmolested to their homes. The Clover Hill village (\\"Appomattox Court House\\") of the 1850s consisted of the Clover Hill Tavern, the Old Appomattox Court House, two blacksmith shops, the original county jail, the Jones and Woodson law offices, the Plunkett-Meeks Store, two stables, the McLean and Peers homes and some cabins. A National Park Service marker at the front entrance of the Clover Hill Tavern reads: Historical significance The Clover Hill Tavern with its guest house and slave quarters have special meaning in American history as designated by the National Park Service under their criteria by embodying the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, and method of construction in the mid nineteenth century. The buildings and resources constitute a typical farming community of Virginia as well as a government seat (county \\"court house\\" seat) of the nineteenth century in the United States. They were all registered and documented in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Physical description The Clover Hill Tavern is constructed of local brick laid in a Flemish bond. The two-story structure has a full attic. It is wide by deep.

The Clover Hill Tavern was restored in 1954 by the Park. Guest house and kitchen Clover Hill Tavern guest house The guest house and kitchen associated with the Clover Hill Tavern was originally constructed around 1819. It is a separate independent three-story brick structure that was used as another tavern dining room and overflow guest rooms. The guest house building was reconstructed and renovated in 1954 and rehabilitated in 1997. The self-standing separate structure is located northwest of the Clover Hill Tavern, which was refurbished in 1953. National Park Service The first floor was an additional kitchen and the second story was used for additional guest rooms. It is wide and deep. It has a full finish attic, but no cellar. The south side has four bay windows on the second floor with two board and batten doors at the center flanked sash windows.

In the 1800s this structure gave the surrounding village the name, Appomattox Court House. The 1865 surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 at the nearby McLean House by General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant commenced the conclusion of the American Civil War that finalized with the surrender of the Shenandoah on November 6, 1865. The court house was registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on June 26, 1989. It is located on Virginia State Route 24, three miles (5 km) northeast of the town of Appomattox in Appomattox County, Virginia, where the \\"new\\" Appomattox Court House is located. History The original \\"old\\" Appomattox Court House was the first county seat of Appomattox County, Virginia. It was built in 1846, one year after Appomattox County was established, at what was known then as Clover Hill, Virginia. It was the second government public structure built after Appomattox County was formed. It was in the center of the village on a large green lot surrounded by the Richmond-Lynchburg stage road. The first building constructed after the county became official was the original wooden county jail built in 1845. The original courthouse was built across the street from the Clover Hill Tavern in 1846. This original courthouse building burned down in 1892. A second courthouse was constructed in 1892, which is near the location of the Appomattox Station in the town of Appomattox, Virginia. The reconstructed \\"old\\" Appomattox Court House is now the visitor center for the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. On the first floor is the information desk. On the second floor is a museum and the auditorium. An interpretive video presents the events of General Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia's surrender to Lieutenant General Grant. Civil War weapons are on display, as are many photographs relating to the event. The \\"old\\" Appomattox Court House was reconstructed in 1963 and 1964 as the park's visitor center and information desk for the National Park Service. Historical significance The reconstructed \\"Court House\\" American Civil War museum 2nd floor The original county \\"court house\\" played no role in the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant, as it was Palm Sunday and the court was closed for the day. The actual surrender took place at the McLean House. The National Park Service states that the Old Appomattox Court House is of paramount importance by virtue of its association with the site. It is vital under certain criteria of the National Park Service and by virtue of its creation of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park by federal law. It represents the participation of the federal government in the preservation and commemoration of historically significant events related to the conclusion of the American Civil War. Description The reconstructed Old Appomattox Court House is a two-story structure of running bond brick with a raised second floor main entry. There is a second story east and west entry porch. The building has newel posts and balusters. The four-panel entry doors on the main level are flanked by 12/12 double hanging sash windows. The size of the structure is wide by deep. It has three bays with a hipped flat-seam roof with wood trusses. The rebuilt edifice has a brick paved first floor beneath the second floor hipped-roof porch with brick cast stone steps and cast iron railings. The lower level has a similar layout with a smaller four- panel door flanked by 8/8 double hanging sash windows. The end elevations have two internal chimneys flanked by 8/8 double hanging sash windows on the first floor with three 8/8 double hanging sash windows on the second level.

In the 1840s the Sweeney clan lived on the stagecoach road northeast of Clover Hill, the name of the village now known as the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. John Sweeney, a wheelwright and Charles' brother, lived in the old family home on the north bank of the Appomattox river with his wife and four children. When Joel was not touring the country entertaining he would stay at John's cabin. Just up the road the four children of John's, being nephews and nieces of Charles, could see their uncle's small cabin. Charles lived in the tiny cabin with his wife and two remaining children. Charles Sweeney's older son Robert, a left-handed fiddle player, lived in even a smaller cabin with his wife and baby daughter downhill from John.Marvel, A Place Called Appomattox, p. 18 Charles Sweeney was born in 1794 as was his wife, Mary.Farrer, p. 209 Historical significance Charles Sweeney The National Park Service states the Charles Sweeney Cabin is meaningful by virtue of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. There is some evidence, in the form of a circa 1930 post card, which indicates that General Fitzhugh Lee and his staff stayed in this house the night before the Surrender. It was originally built between 1830 and 1840 by Charles Sweeney, altered between 1940 and 1950, and restored in 1988 and 1994. Description The Charles Sweeney Cabin is a single-story one-room structure with a loft. It is about twenty feet wide by about eighteen feet deep. The cabin is a post and beam hall house set on dry-laid fieldstone pier foundation, typical of what was in rural Virginia in the nineteenth century. The hall house consists of a \\"hall\\" or keeping room, that was the main room of the cabin. It served as an assortment of various rooms when needed; consisting of a living room, dining room, kitchen, workroom and bedroom. Cooking was done in a fireplace that was set to one end of the large room. A rough, crudely quoined, fieldstone chimney extends to the second floor and above with brick. There are windows on the north, south and east sides. The south and east sides have single four-paneled doors. The interior of the cabin is in good condition. The roof is made of oak shakes, square-butted, and is supported at the eaves by a box cornice. The ends are covered with scribed end boards. The one-room interior of the Charles Sweeney Cabin has a loft accessible in the northwest corner by a dog-leg stairway. The stairway has many of its original balusters. It also has original trim on the stringers, the structural member of the stairway that supports the treads and risers. The square newel and rail are formed from one piece of an oak branch. There is a small closet under the staircase that has its original four-paneled door with concave, quarter-circle corners on the raised panels. All the inside of the \\"hall\\" room exposed to the eye is whitewashed. The door and window surrounds suggest the cabin was intended to be, but never was, plastered. The east side has a four-paneled door which is flanked by 6/6 double hanging sash windows. The east side has a single centered four-panel door on the main floor that opens directly into the multi- purpose keeping room. Above is a six-light (eight foot by twelve inch) casement. The north side has a single 6/6 double hanging window. Hewn oak L-formed corner posts and knee braces alternate with the secondary members made of pine.

Historical significance The Sweeney-Conner cabin is a vital part of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park by virtue of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. It is also noteworthy because of its distinctive characteristics as an example of vernacular architecture of a \\"hall\\" type cabin common in rural Virginia at the time of the Surrender. In Virginia small one room cabins were designed to be as a hall-and-parlor house with chimneys at each end, not in the center as a New English style cabin.Glassie, pp. 126‚Äì129 The National Park Service says the Sweeney-Conner cabin is also distinctive because of its characteristics as an example of an original antebellum single pen log cabin and representative of typical homesteading construction within southcentral Virginia prior to the American Civil War. The National Park Service restored it in 1986 and 1987. Description The Connor-Sweeney cabin is a single story log plank cabin similar to the R. J. N. Williams cabin with a sleeping loft. Its foundation is a deeply pointed fieldstone foundation. There is a shake roof supported by a box cornice at the eaves. It is about sixteen feet wide and about eighteen feet deep with a gable roof. The logs are half-diamond notch interlocking ends with each log approximately six inches wide by nine inches high. The chinking material and composition is unknown. The logs are shimmed and sheathed in six inch exposure weatherboard with two to four inch wide corner boards. There are plain boxed cornice overhangs on north and south elevations. There are flush tapered rake boards on the gable ends. The exposed end chimney on the east side is of stone with a gap between the stack and the gable end. Flanking the chimney are two small four-light casement sash windows. There are entries on the north and south sides. There are two windows on the east side with the loft space that are on both sides of the chimney. There is one window on the west side in the loft area.

Robert E. Lee and his subordinate commanders to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, future President of the United States. *Criteria C - It preserves the distinctive characteristics of embodying the period and method of construction typical in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-nineteenth century. It is considered typical of a county government seat and of a typical farming community in mid-nineteenth century Virginia.

It was registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on June 26, 1989. History In the early sixteen hundreds, Captain John Smith explored the territory of Virginia under the sponsorship of the Virginia Company of London to colonize it for profits. In 1612, Smith made a map of what he had found. In his detailed map he showed the area including rivers and mountains. He also included settlements of the many tribes of Indians. Smith showed a tributary off the James River where there was an Indian Village that was called \\"Appamatuck\\". The tributary river joining the James River near this village was named after the Appamatuck Indians. There were many spelling variations for Appamatuck over the next two hundred years and it eventually developed for the English settlers into \\"Appomattox\\". The need for localized service set about the formation of a new county by an act that was passed on February 8, 1845. It came from parts of Prince Edward, Buckingham, Charlotte and Campbell counties. The new \\"Appomattox County\\" seat was put at Clover Hill because it was centrally located along the Richmond-Lynchburg stagecoach road. Most of the new county came from Prince Edward County. There was already a stagecoach stop at Clover Hill, the new county seat hamlet which was high overlooking the Appomattox River. After officially made the courthouse seat and the name changed to \\"Appomattox Court House\\" in 1845 there was a surge of activity in real estate. Lots changed hands several times in land speculation in anticipation of new public buildings. The first building constructed was a county jail in 1845, a log structure. Then came a new courthouse across the stagecoach road west in 1846. During the American Civil War the original log jail burned down around 1867. It was replaced in 1870 with the present three story brick jail, the New County Jail, which was already started in construction in 1860. Historical significance The New County Jail represents the participation of the federal government in the preservation and commemoration of historically significant events. It also has distinctive characteristics as an example of embodying a type, period, and method of construction in the 1870s in rural Virginia. It is noted both as a county government seat and of a farming community in Piedmont Virginia in the nineteenth century. Description The New County Jail layout and exterior finish clearly depict its use as a jail. It is a three-story building of forty feet wide and twenty feet deep and across Main Street from the site of the old original wooden county jail. The construction of the building started in 1860, however it was not finished until 1867 due to the Civil War. The structure is made of brick and iron. It has at least two different brick types due to the long construction time. The prisoner jail cells with iron bars were on the top two floors. It also has an attic.

The first floor where the sheriff's office and quarters were have fireplaces. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR It is constructed with interior partitions of brick with stone window sills and lintels at the cells. It is built with a standing seam gable roof. There is a wooden platform on brick piers at the rear door and the metal frame walls are mortared. The gable roof was replaced in 1978. The chimney tops were repaired in 1982. The exterior walls are of local brick with half-brick vent holes into the crawl space below the first floor level. The second and third floor has outer east and west windows. The cell windows have lintels and sills cut from local sandstone. The center hall and first floor windows have wood sills and lintels.

It was originally built by Samuel McDearmon in 1854 and rented by Woodson for his law office until he purchased it a couple of years later. It is a small structure and was built next to the main general store of Appomattox (then called Clover Hill).Marvel, A place called Appomattox, has an extensive bibliography (pp. 369-383) which lists manuscript collections, private papers and letters that were consulted, as well as, newspapers, government documents, and other published monographs that were used in his research of Appomattox. The one room structure is historically significant to the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and was registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on June 26, 1989. History The law office building was built between 1851 and 1856. It was purchased by lawyer John W. Woodson in 1856. It was a working law office during the time of the surrender of Confederate General Lee to the Union commander General Grant on April 9, 1865. Its furnishing are consistent with law offices of the time period, including an attorney's desk and a portrait of George Washington.Gutek, Plantations and Outdoor Museums in America's Historic South, p. 299 John W. Woodson was no longer living at the time when General Lee surrendered to General Grant. Woodson was born March 8, 1824 and died July 1, 1864. There is no confirmed evidence that it was necessarily always occupied by Woodson. He was an attorney that practiced law in the Old Appomattox Court House. Woodson rented the building from Samuel D. McDearmon starting on January 1, 1854. He used the building to store his law books, legal documents, and a change of clothing. In his book A Place Called Appomattox, historian William Marvel notes that \\"it was not until the first court day of 1854 that Woodson bought a hasp, hinge, and padlock for the building and a lock for the chest in which he could store a change of clothes.\\"Marvel, A Place Called Appomattox, p. 39 In 1856 Woodson purchased the beige frame building from McDearmon, who was bankrupt by then. Woodson's village office was on the same corner lot as John Sear's blacksmith shop and had a small footprint.Marvel, A Place Called Appomattox, pp. 38-47 Woodson decided to sell the balance of the lot not used by himself to a John Plunkett, who owned the adjacent village general store known as the Plunkett- Meeks Store. The historian Marvel indicates that when John Woodson died of typhoid in 1864 \\"the little law office at Clover Hill\\" was left to his wife.Marvel, A Place Called Appomattox, p. 186 Historical significance The Appomattox Court House National Historical Park declares there are three of the National Register Criteria that make the structure historically significant. *Criteria A - It has meaningful value because of its association with the site of the surrender of the Confederacy's supreme military commander and its principal army, which represented the conclusion of the American Civil War. *Criteria B - It has meaningful value because of its association with the site of the surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee and his subordinate commanders to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, future President of the United States. *Criteria C - It preserves the distinctive characteristics of embodying the period and method of construction typical in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-nineteenth century. It is considered typical of a county government seat and of a typical farming community in mid-nineteenth century Virginia. Description The Woodson Law Office is a single story frame structure that is twelve and a half feet wide by fourteen and a half feet deep. Its construction started as early as 1851 and is post and beam on brick piers with a standing seam gable roof. It is sheathed in weatherboard with six inch exposure. There is an 8-panel door on the east gable front side. The west side has an external common bond brick chimney with a single step and a five course corbelled drip. The south and north sides have 6/6 double-hung sash with ten-inch and twelve-inch lights. It has single full-width shutters with exterior faces of beaded boards laid diagonally. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR It was moved from its original location to be connected to north side of the Plunkett-Meeks store before 1874. It presently shows the relationship as it was to the Plunkett-Meeks Store and village scene at the time of surrender of General Lee to General Grant. The National Park Service restored the building in 1959 and in 1985.

The Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store and storehouse building was registered and documented in the National Register of Historic Places on June 26, 1989. Description The Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store is a two-story gray building with a basement and attic. It has a deep pointed rubble fieldstone raised foundation and sheathed in weatherboards with a gable wood shingle roof. The wood shingles are round-butt. The building is about twenty feet wide by thirty six feet deep. The north porch is five feet by sixteen feet. The east end of the Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store has an eight-foot by eighteen-foot temple form entry porch on brick piers. The paried four-panel entry doors are flanked by 9/9 double hanging windows. The second floor has 6/9 double hanging windows. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR The Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store is enclosed at the second floor approached by a set of open riser stairs. The first floor is furnished and interpreted as a General Store and post office. The second floor is used for offices of the park. The structure was restored in 1959 and again in 1983. The structure was altered some in 1874. Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks storage building next to Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks store and behind the Woodson Law office =Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks storage building= The one story frame building was built by John Plunkett around 1850. The original orientation of the Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks storage building is not known. It may have had doors facing the main village street and the Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store and may have been located on the fence line at the southwest corner of the property. The one story gray structure is sixteen feet wide by fourteen feet deep. It has a gable roof and deeply pointed, rough-cut, fieldstone piers. The structure is sheathed in weatherboards of about five and a half inches. They are covered by a clipped- corner wood shingle roof. The west and south entrances have four panel doors. The north side does not have any openings. The sash windows are 6/6 double hanging. Its present location is next to the Plunkett‚ÄìMeeks Store and behind the Woodson Law office, although this probably was not its original location when built originally by John Plunkett in 1850.

Formerly four large mansions in 1873 and part of the Coastguard station, the hotel has extensive sea views. It is a Marriott hotel in Bournemouth. History =1873‚Äì1902= The origin of the Bournemouth Highcliff Marriott Hotel can be traced back to 1873 when a terrace of four large mansions was in the process of being built on the West Cliff. The terrace never operated as four houses as planned. During the year a company was formed for the purpose of \\"finishing it and opening it as a monster hotel with all the most recent improvements\\". The new hotel was named Highcliffe Mansions. Highcliffe Mansions were soon attracting \\"aristocratic patronage\\". Among those staying there in February 1875 were the Earl and Countess of Dartmouth, Lord and Lady Vivian, Lady Barbara Legge and her three daughters and Lady Charlotte Sturt. The hotel's success was not surprising. Its prominent position gave it extensive views seaward, and, in those days, inland; and being new was \\"fitted and supplied with novelties and conveniences suitable for the requirements of first class visitors\\". =1902‚Äì1940= During those years there were a number of changes at the Highcliffe. No 105 St Michael's Road, known as \\"Glengarry\\", was acquired in 1920, and became an annexe of the hotel. A garage was built behind it. A few years later a two-floor, four-bay extension was added in St Michael's Road attached to the north side of the main building. It had a sloping roof with dormer windows. Highcliffe Houses, east of the hotel, nine cottages of 1831 formerly part of the Coastguard station converted into three houses, was acquired by the Highcliffe in November 1925. Later on a house called the Beacon on the corner of Beacon Road and West Cliff Drive was also bought. This was leased by the Highcliffe and became The Bay Hotel. Collingwood House in Kerley Road was purchased in 1932. The main development in this period was the building of a large six-bay extension on the east of the hotel. Old deeds show this to have been completed by 1925. This gave the hotel a sea frontage of around 500 feet. The extensive grounds had a nine-hole putting green. There was also modern garage accommodation sufficient for 50 cars. In the mid 1930s a new Cocktail Lounge furnished in the then fashionable Art Deco style was opened. Old Front of the Bournemouth Highcliff Marriott Hotel =1940‚Äì1945= In May 1940, after a meeting of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee at the hotel, their leader Clement Attlee telephones Downing Street with the news that Labour would join a National Government but not if Chamberlain was Prime Minister. In less than two hours King George VI had sent for Winston Churchill and asked him to form a Government. Soon afterwards the hotel was requisitioned by the government. Canadian troops, and later Americans, were billeted here. =1945‚Äì1957= At the end of the war, the Highcliffe was acquired by international hotelier Auguste Wild. Born in Alsace in 1869 Wild had managed luxury hotels in Switzerland and Egypt before taking over the Royal Court Hotel in Sloane Square in London in 1919. After it was de-requisitioned, the Highcliffe re-opened on May 20h 1946 with the Labour Party Conference, the first since their election victory in July 1945. Terms at this time for full board were 9 guineas a week. Following Auguste Wild's death in 1957 at the age of 89, chairmanship of Wild's Hotels Ltd passed to his son Robert. In 1956, the hotel changed its name to Highcliff. For years there had been confusion, particularly with deliveries of post, with the Highcliffe Hotel at Highcliffe near Christchurch, about ten miles east of Bournemouth. It was decided to settle the matter by the toss of a coin. The other Highcliffe won the wager and so Wild's hotel lost its \\"e\\". =1957‚Äì1988= The 1960s saw many improvements and changes at the Highcliff. In 1962 an extension until 2am for drinking and dancing was granted, one of the first in the country London under the provisions of the 1961 Licensing Act. Around the same time the Cliff Top Swimming Pool was completed. In 1965 a new lounge bar was opened and the kitchens modernised at a cost of ¬£30,000. A veranda was built along the south front. At the end of 1970, the Highcliff was closed while extensive modernisation work was carried out and a fully equipped conference centre was built. The hotel re-opened in May 1971. It became a popular venue for the annual conferences of all the political partied and trade unions. Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair and many well-known trade union leaders, have all been to the Highcliff. Others who have stayed at or visited the Highcliff over the years, include Robert Louis Stevenson, who stayed in 1884 while he was looking for a house, Beatrice and Sydney Webb, Madame Prokofiev, U Thant, then Prime Minister of Burma, Rudolf Schwartz, the first post-war of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Rudolf Nureyev. The hotel has had close connections with Rotary, Round Table and Lions International. =The Highcliff, Whitbread and Marriott International= In 1999, Whitbread PLC the leisure and hotel group bought the Swallow Group for ¬£578 million and thus became the owners of the Highcliff Hotel. Three years earlier, Whitbread had acquired the Marriott franchise in Britain. A¬£6.5 million refurbishment of guest bedrooms incorporating new bathrooms and air conditioning, the main function suites and the restaurant, was begun in 2000 to raise the hotel to Marriott Standards. In May 2001 came the start of a new chapter in the hotel's history with the official launch of the Bournemouth Highcliff Marriott Hotel. Since 2006 the hotel has been fully managed by Marriott International.

History The Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House has major importance to the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park by virtue of its association with the history and the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant of the American Civil War.Howard, p. 331 It was constructed in 1849 to 1850 by Thomas S. Bocock and Henry F. Bocock, brothers. Thomas was a member of the United States Congress and Speaker of the Confederate House of Representatives. At the time Henry was Clerk of the Court for Appomattox County. Lewis Daniel Isbell (1818-1889) was Appomattox County Commonwealth Attorney during the American Civil War (Judge later) and occupied the house at the time General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant in 1865. He was Appomattox County's representative to the Secession Convention of 1861 and voted to secede from the Union. Historical significance The Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House has importance because of its distinctive characteristics of a type, period, and method of construction during the nineteenth century in rural Virginia. The building with its resources associated with the Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House are typical of both a county government seat (\\"court house\\") in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-nineteenth century and of a farming community in Virginia. Description The Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House is much like the Peers House. The post and beam house is a three bay two-story structure. The Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House is nineteen feet wide by fifty feet deep with a raised basement of brick laid in common bond. The gable roof is covered with wood shingles. The house frame is sheathed by weatherboards. The southeast closet extension has a shed roof, is two and a half feet by six and a half feet. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR The north (entrance) porch has a flat roof of nearly fifteen feet by ten and a half feet.

The first-floor, second-floor and basement windows are 6/6 DH. The first and second floor windows have shutters. The north facade entry door is a wood door with four raised panels, with a fifteen-light transom above. The Bocock‚ÄìIsbell House was restored in 1948 to 1949 and preserved in 1992 to 1993. Work was done on it again to stabilize it in 1995 and again it was preserved in 1999.

The one-story post and beam building was inherited by his wife Mariah upon his death in 1851. It is important to the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park because of its association with the site where the surrender of the Confederate Army under Robert E. Lee to Union commander Ulysses S. Grant took place on April 9, 1865 with their major commanders. On that morning Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's Union infantry advancing through the village was halted on the outskirts of town. As his right flank reached the Mariah Wright house, a flag of truce came out from the Confederate lines. General George Armstrong Custer of Little Bighorn fame received the flag. Historical significance The Mariah Wright House is historically important because it embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, and method of construction in the nineteenth century in rural Virginia.

Historical marker left A marker near titled \\"Lee's Last Attack\\" says: Description and architecture Back addition added after the war The single story Mariah Wright House is topped with a gable roof and attic. The structure is roughly forty feet deep by eighteen feet wide. The west side of the house has a full length front porch and a central east porch of sixteen and a half feet by seven and a half feet. Both porches are on stone piers with wood shingle shed roofs. The house siding is beaded pine weatherboard. The Mariah Wright House has centered external gable chimneys of filestone to the second floor level. It is stepped back in stone and continuing up as free-standing brick stacks with corbelled drips and accented whitewashed course just below the drip. The doors have six panels with raised centers on the west, east and south facades. The windows are a combination of 4/4 double hanging and 6/6 double hanging. There are two four-light casements flanking the chimney. The Mariah Wright House had an attached kitchen wing added around 1890. In 1965 the National Park Service restored the house, removing the kitchen wing and excavating a basement and full cement foundation. Extensive archeological investigations were conducted at this time and many artifacts were found.

The remains of a stone chimney is what remains in the ruin rubble. The original structure was about wide by deep. It was built with log planks of full dovetail notching. The loft area in the cabin was evidenced by mortising of the second-story joists. The once tin roof was covered with wood shingles. The cabin was constructed in 1850 to 1899 by James N. Williams.

It is a nineteenth-century plantation with a main house and an associated well and slave cabins. Because it existed at the time of the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant, it is significant under certain criteria of the National Park Service. There are certain Civil War-era maps that show that there were approximately 10 buildings on this site then. Samuel D. McDearmon purchased the undeveloped \\"Clover Hill\\" tract from Hugh Raine in 1846, cutting off for a county seat for the new Appomattox county. In 1849 he began improving the now property adding $1,056 worth of buildings. By 1851 he had made improvements totaling $2,800, likely indicating that the mansion house had been completed. This chronology also corresponds to his known political and financial zenith. Although he offered the tract for sale in October 1854,Marvel A Place Called Appomattox p.42-3.

It was modified in the beginning-to-early twentieth century (1900 to 1920) with a one-story wrap- around porch and a second-story walkway and porte cochere. The front lower- story entrance has a double-leaf door with side and transom lights, the same for second-story porch. The windows were of 6/6 thin muntin double-hung sash with an alteration on the east facade of 4/1 sash. The roof appears to have had a widow's walk. The house was removed between 1965 and 1970. The McDearmon-Tibbs estate was an early-pre-Civil War plantation that was a working farm up to the mid-twentieth century. A well served the main house and slave cabin area. The well was located northeast of the McDearmon-Tibbs-Scott house. There is a cast-in-place concrete cover over the original brick-lined well. The cover is about square with a opening. The abutting cover at side is an basin with wall. The basin rests on top of cover and is supported by two cast-in-place piers. The well is filled except for the top . =Tinsley-Scott Tenant House Ruin #1-West= The Tinsley-Scott Tenant House Ruin #1-West is given the structure number 31A. It is one of two tenant house ruins behind the Tibbs-Scott main house ruin. It was built within line of original slave cabins as depicted on the Micheler Map. The slave houses date from post Civil War to the 1880s, but construction components appear to be from earlier structures; possibly slave cabins or other structures. This house is believed to post-date the eastern house due to its smaller size and use of bead board for interior finishes. It was built in 1865 to 1880 and altered in the later part of the twentieth century. It was originally two stories, four bay wide by one room deep. It had a gable roof with a central chimney, centered within roof ridge. Its size was about wide by about deep. It was high to the roof peak. It had boxed eave/fascia with heavy timber brace framing with earlier nails found embedded in sill beam in inverted position. There were two doors offset from centered chimney, flanked by double-hung sash. The second story has collapsed to the first floor level in the center. It is intact on the east elevation. The interior exhibits bead board finish applied to frame. =Tinsley-Scott Tenant House Ruin #2-East= The Tinsley-Scott Tenant House Ruin #1-West is given the structure number 31B. It is one of two tenant house ruins behind the Tibbs-Scott main house ruin. It was built within line of original slave cabins as depicted on the Micheler Map. The slave houses date from post Civil War to the 1880s, but construction components appear to be from earlier structures; possibly slave cabins or other structures. This house is believed to pre-date the western house due to its larger size and use of plaster and lath on interior finish. It was built in 1865 to 1880 and abandoned in 1950 to 1960. It was originally two stories, four bay wide by one room deep. It was a gable roofed tenant house. Its size was about wide by about deep. It was about to the bottom of the exposed sill and about to the bottom of the foundation. It was built in braced timber frame. The interior has ghosts of plaster and lath on wood members. The central chimney is centered on ridge. The western wall is still standing, and the remaining majority of the house has collapsed inward. The western sill beam has mortised holes for roof rafters and the eastern sill is in height. Coleman house ruin The original Coleman Family homestead was given to Samuel H. Coleman and his wife Armanda as a wedding present from the bride's father. The farm existed in 1862 and continually worked into the early 20th century. The Coleman house ruin is located north of the Oakville Road trace in an area of heavy Civil War fighting leading up to the end of the war. The Coleman house ruin is significant under certain criteria of the National Park Service by virtue of its association with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. It is significant under certain criteria as being likely to yield information important in Virginia history of the 19th and 20th century. The house was abandoned between 1920 and 1950. The above ground remains are high by over long, however the lines of the remaining foundation are clearly visible. The north elevation contains ruins of an exterior stone fireplace, deep by long by high. There are indications of a brick chimney stack. The upper wall configurations or construction is unknown. The theory is that it was log plank. The Coleman Tobacco Barn was an original agricultural outbuilding to the Coleman estate and the only remaining still- standing structure. The building located north of the Richmond-Lynchburg Stage Road Trace existed at the time of the American Civil War and is representative of the grain culture. It is significant under certain criteria by embodying the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, and method of construction in rural Virginia of the nineteenth century. The buildings and resources constitute a holistic landscape typical of both a county government seat in Piedmont Virginia in the mid-19th century and of a farming community in Virginia. Sweeney dam ruin and mill race The original Sweeney dam and mill race were built by Alexander Sweeney around 1790 to power his milling operation that are now ruins. The structures are located south of the prizery and were built in the 18th century. It was used up to the time of the end of the American Civil War. They were abandoned in 1930 to 1940. The earthen dam ruin was stone infill of over in length by almost high and bridged the Appomattox River. It is tapered shape with a walkway at approximately west at the base. It varies at the top from wide.

It was registered in the National Park Service's database of Official Structures on June 26, 1989. History Transporting goods in hogsheads This building, constructed around 1790 to 1799, is the oldest structure in the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. The Sweeney prizery is a building that was a tobacco-packing house owned by Major Joel Flood in 1865. The local farmers would bring their crop of tobacco here to be packed in hogsheads for storage and later transport to the market. Many Confederate soldiers camped in this vicinity during the previous night of the surrender of the Confederate army to the Union army on April 9, 1865.Appomattox Court House: Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, Virginia, U.S. Department of the Interior The Sweeney prizery is located near the site of General Lee's headquarters.Scott, p. 282 The Sweeney prizery was built primarily as a residence for Alexander Sweeney and the cellar used as a prizery for his business. A prizery is a building where tobacco was \\"prized.\\" Prized means the tobacco is pressed layer by layer into hogshead barrels, large casks or barrels to store and transport tobacco. These casks often weighed up to 1000 pounds. The tobacco plants were first \\"stemmed\\" (stripped of fibers) and then packed when the autumn harvest came in. Tobacco is handled in a leaf stemmery. It is received in baskets from the warehouse and weighed. Then it is roughly graded by basketsfuls and stored in heaps waiting for stemming. The leaves are conditioned for handling. After stemming the \\"strips\\" are graded and bundled into \\"hands.\\" These are straddled over sticks and put through drying and \\"prized\\" into hogsheads. The scrap tobacco resulting from handling the leaf was stored in bulk. When it was in sufficient quantity it was then cleaned in a sand reel, dried, and \\"prized.\\"The Weekly Underwriter, Item notes: v.83 (1910:July-Dec.) Historical significance The prizery is outstanding under certain criteria of the National Park Service for its distinctive characteristics of a tobacco packing house. The National Park Service points out it is of historical importance because of the association with the nineteenth century events of the village of Appomattox Court House (then also known as Clover Hill) and with the site of General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865.U.S. Government Printing Office, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1978, Item notes: v. 5, p. 501 Physical description The Sweeney prizery (tobacco packing house) is a single story structure with a loft and full cellar. The building was intended as a residence and prizery. It is about thirty six feet wide by sixteen feet deep. The prizery is built into a bank. The building has a foundation of rough-hewn sandstone that makes up the cellar walls. There is board sheathing on the inside of the exterior weatherboards. and and one photo, undated, at Virginia DHR The prizery cellar has no external openings except the three on the southeast side of two doors and a paired upward-opening casement. There are two brick external chimneys, one at each gable end. The interior ceilings are unplastered. The supports are heavily whitewashed. The front northwest elevation has two doors. The post-1865 east porch and \\"ell\\" addition was removed in 1959 when first mothballed. The Sweeney prizery was also called the Flood Tenant House and the St. Clair house. The foundation was stabilized in 1959 and again in 1979. In 1959 there was metal cover sheeting put in place to protect the wood clapboard walls and wooden shingled gable roof. ::Pictures of the Sweeney prizery as it looked in 1959.

Biography  Born on 23 March 1886 in Dieuze, a town situated in a part of France occupied by the Prussians since 1871, Rouzet moved to the Paris area as soon as he could. His first step was to have his French citizenship made official through the \\"reinstatement process\\" (needed in his case in those days). He started his professional life as an apprentice in different companies exploring various technologies. During the same period, he attended evening classes at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers (National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts), and some time later he sat for a diploma at the Ecole des Travaux Publics (School of Public Works), which he obtained as an electrical engineer. During World War II, from 1 November 1941 to 30 September 1944, he acted as an occasional agent for the Forces Fran√ßaises Combattantes (French fighting forces) in the CND-Castile Network, under the command of Colonel R√©my. After the war, he brought his expertise as vice president to the Centre d'Etudes de la R√©sistance (Studies of the Resistance Center) in the town of Clichy-la- Garenne. Rouzet died on 4 March 1948. Discoveries and inventions Rouzet invented the logarithmical variable condenser. After his military service as a telegrapher, he reenlisted, contributing his most important invention, a wireless telegraph system allowing aircraft communications at unequalled distances at that time. The invention played a major part during World War I. Fond of music, he studied the tuning principles of instruments, and, using as a basis Mercadier's and Marie Alfred Cornu's experiments on the relationship between the frequencies of fundamental chords, he developed a theory called rational scale, which took into account the different \\"colours\\" of a single theme played in different keys. This theory was awarded a prize by the Acad√©mie Nationale de Metz (National Academy of Metz), a member of which he became, and by the \\"Soci√©t√© d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale\\" (Society of Encouragement for National Industry). But the supporters of the simple chromatic scale remained unconvinced, and their theory was maintained. Unsatisfied with the principles that were considered the basis of thermodynamics, he devoted himself to the study of that field of physics and brought forward a theory based on other new grounds, to give better explanations for some physical and chemical phenomena. His theory was short- lived. Nevertheless, he carried on with more exhaustive researches in that field where he obtained major developments. After his death, the theory was presented to the CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research), \\"who recognized the relevance of it\\", but said that \\"the principles taught at present, as imperfect as they may be, were sufficient practically speaking.\\" History of the Rouzet TSF (wireless telegraph system) Lucien Rouzet at his transmitting station on board the test aeroplane on 3 May 1912 in Chartres In the early years of the 20th century, radio connections, which used Morse Code, were only land transmissions. The techniques to amplify signals upon reception were still unknown, so the maximum distance at which messages could be detected depended entirely upon the transmitter's power. In the military field, General Ferri√© had a major communication network built, but the transmitting stations were too heavy to be carried aboard aeroplanes. Therefore, engineers tried to minimise the weight-to-power ratio, and short- distance connections between planes and the ground became possible. Among those engineers was Rouzet, who developed a system that proved to be extremely efficient, as revealed during a test flight lasting nearly one hour at an altitude of more than on 7 May 1912. Journalists were present, and articles reported the test and its results in French and foreign newspapers. Rouzet then filed for patents in France and many other countries (with, not surprisingly, much difficulty in Germany, who was France's enemy at the time). The Soci√©t√© Industrielle de TSF et d'√©lectricit√© (Industrial Society of Wireless Telegraph and Electricity) was set up to operate the invention, and devices were supplied to several countries (except Germany). The French army, however, demanded an official comparative test with the other systems. In May 1914, on a single circuit over Blois and the Sarthe region, the test was carried out, with reception at Villacoublay. The signals broadcast by the aeroplane carrying the Rouzet system were the only ones received unbroken. The military demanded another test, but war was on its way, and the test was not carried out. As a result, the French air squadrons had no wireless telegraph. However, the Rouzet system was used by the allied forces. The British Admiralty mandated its use;The War in the Air; Vol. 1, by Walter Raleigh. a letter signed by Post Captain Navy Attach√© to the Embassy of England on 23 January 1915 reads: > I am authorised by the Admiralty to inform you that the satisfactory results > achieved so far can be attributed for a large part to the devices > manufactured by your Establishment.Original: Je suis autoris√© par l'Amiraut√© > de vous faire conna√Ætre que les r√©sultats satisfaisants obtenus jusqu'ici, > peuvent √™tre attribu√©s dans une grande mesure aux appareils fabriqu√©s par > votre Maison. Later, the French Navy made widespread use of those devices for active observation of maritime aviation ranging more than away. On land, Rouzet, from the top of the Eiffel Tower, was able to set up communications to even greater distances. When the \\"lamp\\" for the amplification of signals on reception was perfected, interest was lost in Rouzet's system, and the operating company ceased activity. On that occasion, Rouzet was offered a silver cup, engraved in French with the salutation: \\"Tribute from the Board of Directors of the TSF and Electricity Industrial Company to their engineer, Lucien Rouzet, inventor of the first wireless telegraph system for aeroplanes.\\"Original: Hommage du Conseil d'Administration de la Soci√©t√© Industrielle de TSF et d'√©lectricit√© √† son ing√©nieur Lucien Rouzet, inventeur du premier syst√®me de TSF applicable aux a√©roplanes.

Moreover, Malino also produces fruits and vegetables that grows in typical mountain slopes in Bawakaraeng. Most people of South Sulawesi still consider the mountains a sacred place and still practices local rituals there. Temperatures in Malino ranges from 10 ¬∞C to 26 ¬∞C. When it is the wet season the city is often foggy. The journey from Makassar to this area takes about 2 hours. The Thousand Staircase Waterfall, Takapala Waterfall, Nittoh Tea Gardens, Lembah Biru, Japanese Bunker Heritage, and Mount Bawakaraeng are the hallmarks of Malino. Souvenirs typical of this area are Passion fruits, glutinous lunkhead, Tenteng Malino, apples, wajik, etc. Malino is also a rice producing area for the region of South Sulawesi. The town was the venue for the 1946 Malino Conference during the Indonesian National Revolution. The Malino II Accord was also signed there in February 2002. History Before it was renamed Malino, locals called the village 'Lapparak (·®í·®Ñ·®ë)'. Laparrak (·®í·®Ñ·®ë) in the Makassarese language means flat. The city of Malino has come to be known and increasingly popular since the Dutch colonial era, especially after the Governor-General Caron in 1927 ruled in \\"Celebes on Onderhorighodon\\" and made Malino in 1927 as a resting place for government employees.

Malino Conference  left The Dutch organised a conference in the Sulawesi town of Malino in July 1946 as part of their attempt to arrange a federal solution for Indonesia. From the end of World War II, Indonesian Republicans had been trying to secure Indonesian Independence from the Dutch colonial control. The Dutch invited thirty-nine Indonesian representatives of the local rulers (rajas), Christians, and several other ethnic groups of Kalimantan and East Indonesia who supported the idea of some form of continuing Dutch connection. However, the Dutch had not anticipated the level of support amongst the Indonesians for genuine autonomy. The conference resulted in plans for a state in Kalimantan and another for East Indonesia.

Between 1941 and 1944, more than a million Jews living in the Soviet Union were murdered by Nazi Germany's \\"Final Solution\\" extermination policies. Most of them were killed in Ukraine because most pre-WWII Soviet Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement, of which Ukraine was the biggest part. According to Yale historian Timothy D. Snyder, \\"the Holocaust is integrally and organically connected to the Vernichtungskrieg, to the war in 1941, and is organically and integrally connected to the attempt to conquer Ukraine.\\" Death squads (1941‚Äì1943) The Last Jew in Vinnitsa, the 1942 photograph showing a Jewish man near the town of Vinnytsia about to be shot dead by a member of Einsatzgruppe D.

Total civilian losses during the war and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at four million, including up to a million Jews who were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen, the Order Police battalions, Wehrmacht and local Nazi collaborators. Einsatzgruppe C (Otto Rasch) was assigned to north and central Ukraine, and Einsatzgruppe D (Otto Ohlendorf) to Moldavia, south Ukraine, the Crimea, and, during 1942, the north Caucasus. According to Ohlendorf's testimony at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, \\"the Einsatzgruppen had the mission to protect the rear of the troops by killing the Jews, Romani, Communist functionaries, active Communists, uncooperative slavs, and all persons who would endanger the security.\\" In practice, their victims were nearly all Jewish civilians (not a single Einsatzgruppe member was killed in action during these operations). The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum tells the story of one survivor of the Einsatzgruppen in Piryatin, Ukraine, when they killed 1,600 Jews on 6 April 1942, the second day of Passover: Jews digging their own graves.

The most notorious massacre of Jews in Ukraine was at the Babi Yar ravine outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29‚Äì30 September 1941. (An amalgamation of 100,000 to 150,000 Ukrainian and other Soviet citizens were also killed in the following weeks). The mass killing of Jews in Kiev was decided on by the military governor Major-General Friedrich Eberhardt, the Police Commander for Army Group South (SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Friedrich Jeckeln) and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by a mixture of SS, SD and Security Police. On the Monday, the Jews of Kiev gathered by the cemetery, expecting to be loaded onto trains. The crowd was large enough that most of the men, women, and children could not have known what was happening until it was too late: by the time they heard the machine-gun fire, there was no chance to escape.

This is the estimate found in such respected works as The Destruction of the European Jews by Raul Hillberg. In the late 1990s, access to Soviet archives increased the estimates of the prewar population of Jews and as a result, the estimates of the death toll have been increasing. In the 1990s, Dieter Pohl estimated 1.2 million Jews murdered, and more recent estimates have been up to 1.6 million. Some of those Jews added to the death toll attempted to find refuge in the forest, but were killed later on by Home Army, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or other partisan groups during the German retreat.

He managed a Los Angeles nightclub called Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco in the early seventies. He was the subject of a documentary by late filmmaker George Hickenlooper entitled Mayor of the Sunset Strip. He was described as a \\"famous groupie, now respectable\\" by Mick Jagger, and the film documented Bingenheimer's status as a person with numerous high-profile friends. In 2007, he was honored with the 2,330th star on Hollywood Boulevard. Early life Bingenheimer was born in Mountain View, California, to a star-struck mother who separated from Bingenheimer's father when he was only three years old. His father had wanted to be a celebrity but settled for attending celebrity golf events. His mother was described as a \\"difficult woman\\" and a \\"relentless autograph hound\\". One report suggested he had a lonely childhood, since he often spent nights alone while his mother worked as a waitress. Another report suggested that the emerging rock music of the day became his \\"home\\" and a way for him to deal with the divorce of his parents. He devoured fan magazines; he was \\"obsessed\\" with stars. When Bingenheimer was 16,Note: another report was this happened when Rodney was 17; another one suggests he was there when he was 14. his mother drove him to southern California and dropped him off at the house of Connie Stevens, and instructed him to get the star's autograph. Then she left abruptly. This was the beginning of a six-year separation from his mother, and he was on his own in Los Angeles, around the year 1963. Career When Bingenheimer arrived in Los Angeles actor Sal Mineo dubbed him \\"The Mayor of the Sunset Strip.\\" He formed friendships with pop stars of the day such as The Byrds and Sonny & Cher, for whom he was a live-in publicist. In his own words, Bingenheimer \\"became the talk of the town because I had the perfect Brian Jones ‚Äòdo‚Äô (hairstyle).\\" Bingenheimer worked as an intern at Mercury Records. He escorted British pop star David Bowie to L.A. hot spots. He auditioned for the Davy Jones part in the Monkees. While he did not get chosen, he dressed like Davy Jones and had a similar haircut then later worked as a double or stand-in for Jones in the Monkees episode \\"Prince and the Pauper\\". The Monkees stand-in role was a \\"break\\" for Bingenheimer. Bingenheimer was described as shy, thin and unassuming with a \\"squeaky voice\\", usually described as soft. One report suggested his voice was \\"so soft you have to lean in to hear it\\". Another writer described his voice as soft like a \\"harmonica that cuts through the angry noise of today's frat jocks\\". His voice has also been described as \\"tentative\\" and not a \\"vibrating personality\\" or a \\"great radio voice\\" but reflecting almost \\"painful sincerity\\". He was described as having a \\"small, womanish face\\" and that he's worn the \\"same haircut (shaggy with bangs)\\" for most of his life. Actor MacKenzie Phillips reportedly called him a \\"gnome\\" and he's been described as having a faint resemblance to Andy Warhol. Bingenheimer had a certain resemblance to pop star Sonny Bono while Cher and Bingenheimer \\"bonded\\" with Sonny and Cher becoming almost \\"surrogate parents\\" to him. Bingenheimer became a groupie of sorts and formed attachments with prominent artists including Sonny and Cher. He met Cher by going backstage after a concert and according to Bingenheimer, she looked at him and said \\"Oh my God, you look just like Sonny!\\" They \\"bonded\\" and he went to work for them and \\"they took care of me,\\" he said. In a later interview, Bingenheimer explained that many artists grew to like and trust him because of his sincerity, taste in music and not being pushy. Writer Alison Powell in The Guardian wrote that his \\"sincerity helped him gain the trust of Brian Wilson, the Beatles, even Elvis\\". During these years he was photographed near countless celebrities from the worlds of acting and music and Hollywood, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Adam Ant, the Beach Boys and many others, almost like a \\"real life rock'n'roll Zelig.\\" He ingratiated himself to many stars, people liked him. He got himself a job as a gofer for the Monkees and worked as a caterer at one point. In those days of \\"free love\\", he found many young women to \\"mother him\\" and sometimes have sex with him. He was described as being a go-between serving the needs of young women and rock stars and often had sex with women as a precondition for them meeting rock stars later on, according to writer David Edelstein in Slate magazine. Wherever he went in the music and club scene, \\"his face was his passport\\". According to Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant, Bingenheimer had more sex with women than Plant. Incidents contributed to Bingenheimer‚Äôs notoriety. He and Sonny Bono were reportedly asked to leave the Hollywood restaurant Martoni‚Äôs because of their hippie appearance, which reportedly prompted Bono to write the song \\"Laugh at Me\\". Bingenheimer brought Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson to the recording session for Tina Turner‚Äôs lead vocal on the Phil Spector classic \\"River Deep, Mountain High,\\" and he was included in a dialogue by the all-female band The GTOs on their Frank Zappa-produced LP Permanent Damage. In the late 1960s he was hired by Nik Venet to do publicity for Linda Ronstadt‚Äôs group The Stone Poneys but he became so disenchanted with the LA music scene during this period that he moved to the United Kingdom where he enjoyed the London nightclub vibe with the help of his friend David Bowie. He discovered the nascent British glam rock scene and met other emerging stars such as Rod Stewart. Bingenheimer bought many records in London. It was Bowie who suggested that Bingenheimer return to Los Angeles and open a new music club. Club days Siouxsie and the Banshees. Bingenheimer flew back and opened a nightclub initially called the E Club on Sunset Strip with two partners. Outside there was the British flag, the Union Jack. It served \\"British bangers\\" and beer. It had a small \\"VIP area\\" which was a roped-off section near the dance floor. The club opened in October 1972 at 8171 Sunset, near his various West Hollywood apartments, and Bowie was one of the club‚Äôs first guests. It subsequently moved to 7561 Sunset and was renamed Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco. In this version it became a favorite hangout for many rock stars (and a favored haunt for young female groupies) and through the Disco Bingenheimer introduced much of the Los Angeles music scene to glam rock. At one point, Elvis Presley dropped by for \\"pints of Watney's\\". The English Disco also featured occasional live performances, including appearances by The New York Dolls and The Stooges in 1973, and Iggy Pop staged his infamous concert on August 11, 1974, during which he performed an improvised \\"play\\" called Murder of the Virgin (in which he was whipped by guitarist Ron Asheton, who was dressed in a Nazi uniform) and which climaxed with Iggy repeatedly slashing his chest with a knife. In October 1974, Jerome T. Youngman and the band Punk performed with fellow Detroit band Mighty Quick. Speaking of this period, David Bowie later recalled: When the club closed in 1975, Bingenheimer was reportedly disenchanted with the stylized dance genre disco to the extent that he abruptly abandoned his club \\"English Disco,\\" so as not to be associated with the popular movement. But a later report suggested that a disagreement between the owners was the primary cause of the club's closure. During this brief period between his nightclub and KROQ, he made extra money selling his Beatles memorabilia to David Daniel, a friend from his nightclub and the Rainbow Bar and Grill. Bingenheimer briefly resurrected the English Disco in the early 2000s. The Los Angeles-based punk/new wave group The Von Steins performed at the grand re-opening. Radio days: KROQ Due to his far-reaching connections within the burgeoning Hollywood music scene, Bingenheimer was given a show on the then relatively unknown Pasadena FM and AM radio station KROQ, called Rodney on the ROQ, which began in August 1976 and ended June 5, 2017. His tentative voice conveyed a \\"painful sincerity\\" suggesting that he \\"loves the music he plays\\", introducing it like a matchmaker introducing two lovers ‚Äì a person to a song. His radio show strongly influenced the emergence of the Los Angeles punk scene in the late 1970s and was at odds with the prevailing country-rock style that dominated the West Coast music scene at the time. The show featured the latest punk and new wave and glam releases from London and New York, and labored to help celebrities build their careers alongside \\"anybody brave or stupid enough to put out a record in Los Angeles,\\" he said. Bingenheimer later summed up his programming philosophy: Bingenheimer helped popularize European vocalist Nena (pictured in 2008) whose hit song 99 Luftballons became a hit in the U.S. in 1983. Bingenheimer was one of the very few DJs on commercial radio in Los Angeles who was described as having autonomy over music selection. For example, he was described as the first DJ to play many then-up-and-coming bands, including The Runaways, Blondie, the Ramones, The Pandoras, The Hollywood Squares, Social Distortion, Van Halen, Duran Duran, Oasis, The Donnas, No Doubt, Dramarama, The Offspring, The Go-Go's, the Germs, The B-52's, X, The Vandals, Buck Brothers, the Sex Pistols, Teenage Fanclub, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Suicidal Tendencies and others. Nena's song \\"99 Luftballons\\", a hit in German-speaking countries in early 1983, became a hit in the USA in 1984 after Bingenheimer promoted it. Nina Hagen and Christiane Felscherinow, who promoted the film Christiane F. ‚Äì We Children from Bahnhof Zoo, joined his show. Christiane was asked by a listener, what kind of music she liked. So \\"99 Luftballons\\" was put on air.Christiane Felscherinow/Sonja Vukovic: Christiane F. - Mein zweites Leben. Deutscher Levante Verlag, Berlin 2013. P. 95. It went on to become a worldwide hit‚Äîan event that arguably would not have happened if not for Bingenheimer. Also in 1983, KROQ became the first radio station to play the Venice crossover band Suicidal Tendencies, when Bingenheimer added their song \\"Institutionalized\\" to its playlist. Bingenheimer developed a reputation in Los Angeles for being a kingmaker for new artists. His show became an influential part of KROQ, which was a strong influence nationally. One reporter wrote \\"if you make it onto KROQ in America, you've made it in America. This is the house that Rodney built and which corporate radio has spread like spores across the nation.\\" Many bands knocked on the parking lot door of KROQ‚Äôs studio in Pasadena and handed Rodney a copy of their music. If he liked a track, such as Agent Orange‚Äôs 1979 hit \\"Bloodstains,\\" he would play that song within the hour. In 1978, guitarist Eddie Vincent and drummer Tad of The Hollywood Squares gave Rodney a copy of their just released 45 single at his studio door. Within minutes Bingenheimer introduced the mysterious group to his wide listening audience and played \\"Hillside Strangler.\\" The song promptly charted in Record World‚Äôs New Wave Hit Parade. Power pop band Candy singer Kyle Vincent, who at the time was Kim Fowley's personal assistant, tells a similar story: \\"We had just finished recording a few tracks with Kim producing. He told me to take one of the songs over to Rodney's studio, knock on the door, and tell him that Kim says we're the illegitimate sons of Rick Springfield and the Go-Gos. On the way back to my apartment Rodney talked about it and then played it. That was pretty historic for us.\\" Bingenheimer was credited for giving the group Broken Bottles a big break by playing their single Gothic Chicks. In 1995, Bingenheimer introduced a segment to his show titled \\"American in London,\\" co- hosted by Liza Kumjian-Smith, focusing on news and releases from upcoming British bands, which brought Brit Pop to the US and broke many UK bands such as Coldplay, Doves, Muse, Pulp, and more recently the Arctic Monkeys, among others. In the final years of his weekly show, he had been relegated to the midnight to 3:00 a.m. slot on Monday mornings. In 1998, he interviewed the Toronto band Chicklet when they dropped by the station while on tour. This was his first live air interview in years, with an interview of Bad Religion said to be his last prior to this occasion. Film critic Roger Ebert quoted another employee of the station as having said that the station management was \\"afraid to fire him ... because he's the soul of KROQ.\\" Bingenheimer was also responsible for three Rodney on the ROQ compilation albums as well as the compact disc and later digital download compendium. Also Flipside (fanzine) worked on the Rodney on the ROQ compilation album projects with Posh Boy Records and Rodney Bingenheimer to help unite the project together. The album's inserts were issues of Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine. Each insert includes the bands of each volume (music tracks and lyrics) including pictures and interviews gathered by Flipside. Rodney on The ROQ Volume 1 included Flipside Fanzine insert Issue 21 (December 1980).Flipside Fanzine Issue 21 (December 1980) Rodney on The ROQ Volume 2 included Flipside Fanzine Issue 28 (November 1981).Flipside Fanzine Issue 28 (November 1981) Rodney on The ROQ Volume 3 included Flipside Fanzine Issue 35 (December 82).Flipside Fanzine Issue 35 (December 82) This was a strategic time for a radio personality, a record label and a fanzine to work together to support and promote a growing musical underground and exclusive punk scene. \\"The Best of Rodney On The Roq\\" on Posh Boy Records. In an interview on June 29, 2017, talking about why his show was cancelled earlier on June 5, he mentioned that \\"I have no idea. They have new owners. They are going through a lot of changes right now\\". He continued to say, \\"But I was totally shocked. I went to a meeting and I thought it was with everyone (the staff of KROQ), but it was just me. They said it would be better for me and I might not be happy there anymore.\\" He was present at \\"nearly every major interval in the evolution of rock 'n' roll\\" but was described as being relatively unknown outside of Los Angeles, according to the Boston Globe. But he never exploited his connections to become a \\"mogul\\", according to this report, which suggested that Bingenheimer might find such success \\"vulgar\\". Rather, he's been content to be a \\"hanger-on\\". Another report painted the same picture: Personal life Severa Miles, Rodney Bingenheimer, Giddle Partridge and Dan Kapelovitz in 2010. In Mayor of the Sunset Strip, director Hickenlooper examined Bingenheimer's life in a documentary format. According to one account, Bingenheimer was described as \\"intensely private\\" and was nervous about the documentary project to film his life; filming took place over a six-year period. According to this report, Bingenheimer found it was sometimes difficult to answer questions about his parents and love life. The movie suggested that Bingenheimer has had sex with \\"scores of women\\" during his earlier days but those relationships didn't form into lasting attachments with any particular woman. He has never married but apparently still holds on to the possibility that he'll find a woman who has the \\"ideal 1960s vision in plastic miniskirt, Mary Quant lashes and ropes of bullion fringe.\\" In one scene in the documentary, Bingenheimer and a younger woman who he introduces on camera to celebrities as his \\"girlfriend\\" are being interviewed, and it is only at the end of the scene that it is revealed that she has another boyfriend and does not feel romantic towards Rodney; \\"by the time the scene is over, you feel devastated for him: his face says, I was jilted at the prom.\\", according to Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris in 2004. The movie \\"is a portrait of a man who has always needed celebrities to validate him,\\" according to David Edelstein in Slate. He's been compared to the character in the Woody Allen film Zelig in which the character keeps appearing in disparate places. He dines regularly at a Hollywood Denny's restaurant, arriving at 1pm each day, according to one report. Nancy Sinatra dedicated a booth to Bingenheimer at Canter's Deli in the Fairfax District; a plaque commemorating the dedication hangs on the wall above the booth. He owns a \\"classic blue 1967 Pontiac GTO\\". He wears \\"trademark snug black suits\\". Cultural appearances * Bingenheimer was seen driving The Ramones‚Äô pink Cadillac in the film Rock 'n' Roll High School, and provided the hand clapping in \\"The Return of Jackie and Judy\\" on the Phil Spector-produced End of the Century. He also appears in the video for their 1986 song \\"Something to Believe In\\". * He appeared as himself in Cheech and Chong's 1978 film 'Up In Smoke'. * He appeared DJing at KROQ in the documentary The Unheard Music about X, the punk band from Los Angeles. * He was the subject of the documentary film Mayor of the Sunset Strip, directed by George Hickenlooper and produced by Chris Carter. * After years of grassroots support, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce decided to acknowledge his contribution to music and radio with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame which was presented on 9 March 2007. This is the 2,330th star awarded, and it is in front of the Knitting Factory nightclub at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. When asked about his star, he said \\"then people can literally walk all over me\\" but added \\"from down there I can look up girls' dresses.\\" * Bingenheimer was portrayed by J. P. Manoux in the Darby Crash biopic What We Do Is Secret. * Bingenheimer was played by Keir O'Donnell in the 2010 biopic The Runaways. * Bingenheimer recorded a single titled \\"I Hate the '90s\\", and did spoken-word vocals with Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Hole's Eric Erlandson, and cut singles with Lita Ford (Lets Make the Scene) and Blondie with the single \\"Little GTO\\". * He appears in Troma Entertainment's B.C.

From the end of World War II, Indonesian Republicans had been trying to secure Indonesian Independence from the Dutch colonial control. The Dutch invited thirty-nine Indonesian representatives of the local rulers (rajas), Christians, and several other ethnic groups of Kalimantan and East Indonesia who supported the idea of some form of continuing Dutch connection. However, the Dutch had not anticipated the level of support amongst the Indonesians for genuine autonomy. The conference resulted in plans for a state in Kalimantan and another for East Indonesia. Background Following the 17 August 1945 declaration of independence, the Indonesian War of Independence broke out between the Indonesians and the Dutch, who were tying to regain control over their colony. Following the surrender of Japan and the end of the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the eastern part of the country was occupied by Australian forces, accompanied by Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) officials, who the Australians allowed to take over governance. This was in sharp contrast to the policy of the British forces occupying Java and Sumatra, who prevented the Dutch from interfering in administrative concerns. By early 1946, Acting Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Hubertus van Mook had come to the conclusion that it was no longer possible to return to the pre-war status quo, and began to work towards the establishment of an Indonesian commonwealth linked to the Dutch crown. His proposal for such a commonwealth was approved by Dutch Colonial Affairs Minister Johann Logemann, and announced on 10 February. Negotiations in March between van Mook and Indonesia Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir led to recognition of de facto republican control over Java, Madura and Sumatra, and Dutch sovereignty over the rest of Indonesia. When this became known, Sjahrir was briefly arrested by the Indonesian army. Meanwhile, van Mook began cultivating links with Indonesian leaders outside Java, particularly in west Java and eastern Indonesia, and subsequently decided to move ahead with attempts to establish a federal Indonesia by holding a conference in Malino. right Conference delegates Van Mook began making approaches to prospective delegates in April 1946, asking them to attend and participate in a conference to discuss the structure of a government in eastern Indonesia. In those regions such as Bali and South Sulawesi there were representative bodies in place, and these assemblies appointed delegates. In other areas, NICA officials and local leaders nominated representatives. There were a total of 53 delegates and advisers from across eastern Indonesia, including Borneo and West Papua, as well as from Bangka/Belitung. Indonesian vice-president Mohammad Hatta claimed that these delegates were gathered \\"at the point of a bayonet\\", although the delegated subsequently denied this. There was also a large Dutch delegation headed by van Mook. The negotiations The official opening ceremony was held on 16 July, with van Mook making a long speech in which he stated that \\"the Netherlands Government... considers it imperative that, in the quickest possible way and according to carefully thought out plans, these countries [within the Indonesian federation] will be put in a position to govern themselves.\\" Delegates agreed that colonialism must not return to Indonesia, that there must be continued links between Indonesia and the Netherlands and that Indonesia should be united in the form of a federal United States of Indonesia. This would comprise four \\"autonomous territories\\", Java, Sumatra, the Great East (including West Papua) and Netherlands Borneo. It was also resolved to hold a further conference to determine the form of governance for Borneo and the Great East and that Borneo and the Great East should be represented in negotiations between the Republic of Indonesia and the Dutch. A committee of seven would be established to negotiate the future form of the government with the Dutch General Government Commission Aftermath Three months after the conference, delegates from minority groups met at a conference in Pangkal Pinang, Bangka at which they expressed support for the views expressed at Malino. Members of the General Government Commission subsequently met regional leaders and the Commission of Seven Indonesian representatives, who played only an advisory role. Because of the ongoing political instability in Borneo, it was decided to focus the endeavor to establish a federal state on the Great East region. Van Mook subsequently decided to hold the Denpasar Conference in December 1946 to discuss the establishment of a government in this region. Meanwhile, in November, the Dutch reached their first agreement with the republican side, and recognized republican authority over Java, Madura and Sumatra.

The Japanese drove a parachute brigade (fighting as infantry) of the British Indian Army from its positions with heavy casualties, but suffered heavy casualties themselves. The delay imposed on the Japanese by the battle allowed British and Indian reinforcements to reach the vital position at Kohima before the Japanese. Background In March 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-GO, a major invasion of India. Two divisions of the Japanese Fifteenth Army ‚Äì the 15th and 33rd ‚Äì attacked IV Indian Corps at Imphal, the Japanese 31st Division advanced on Kohima, to cut the main road on which the troops at Imphal depended for supply from Dimapur.Rooney 1992, pp. 25 & 49 The Japanese division advanced over a wide front. It was divided into Left, Centre and Right Assault forces. The Left Assault Force consisted of two battalions of the Japanese 58th Regiment,Katoch 2018, p. 37 with the regimental headquarters and detachments from the division's supporting arms. The regiment's commander was Colonel Utata Fukunaga,Rooney 1992, p. 56 but the force was accompanied by the division's Infantry Group commander, Major General Shigesaburo Miyazaki, who was the senior officer. On 18 March, the force was approaching the village of Ukhrul, about north-east of Imphal and north of Sangshak.Rooney 1992, pp. 50‚Äì53Allen 1984, pp. 213‚Äì215 British dispositions Early in 1944, the 49th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Indian Infantry Division had been stationed at Sangshak, tasked with defending against a Japanese advance from the Chindwin River towards Ukhurl.Allen 1984, p. 212 As the Japanese offensive began, the Japanese surrounded the 17th Indian Infantry Division at Tiddim, south of Imphal. Lieutenant General Geoffry Scoones, the commander of IV Corps, was forced to send the 23rd Division (including the 49th Brigade) to help the 17th Division break out of encirclement.Rooney 1992, p. 51 Subsequently, the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was ordered to move to the Sangshak area, to take over the position vacated by the departure of the 49th. At the time, two battalions of the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade had been conducting advanced jungle training in the Kohima area,Allen 1984, p.652 while the third battalion completed its parachute training in India. The brigade consisted of 152 (Indian) and 153 (Gurkha) Parachute Battalions, with a machine gun company, a mountain artillery battery and other supporting arms. Its commander was Brigadier Maxwell Hope-Thompson. Even before the Japanese attack opened, they had received preliminary orders to move to Sangshak. Because of shortage of transport, they required four days (from 14 March to 18 March) to complete the movement. They took under command the 4th Battalion, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry, which had been part of the 49th Brigade,Allen 1984, pp.212‚Äì213 and two companies of the Nepalese Kalibahadur Regiment consisting of 200 men.Seaman 1989, p. 75 Upon arrival, the brigade found that the area they had been assigned had not been prepared by the 49th, and there was no barbed wire to construct field obstacles. Repeated requests were made for defensive stores by the 50th Brigade, but the demands were not met before the battle began.Rooney 1992, pp. 51‚Äì52 Battle =Preliminaries= The 50th Brigade initially deployed over a large area, with outposts east of Sangshak and the machine-gun company in Ukhrul. On 19 March, the Japanese overran an isolated company (C Company of the 152 Parachute Battalion) deployed on a hill known as Point 7378.Rooney 1992, pp. 52‚Äì52 The company was reduced to 20 men. Urged by his second-in-command (Colonel Abbott) that the brigade risked defeat in detail if it remained strung out as isolated posts, Hope-Thompson ordered his forces to concentrate. Most of the force initially concentrated at Sheldon's Corner, east of Sangshak on 21 March, but that afternoon, Hope-Thomson pulled them back, first to \\"Kidney Camp\\" to the west, and then to Sangshak itself, where they took up a defensive position on a hill just east of the village, with an American missionary church at its north end. The position measured only by , and had no fresh water. Hard rock was found only below the soil, so only shallow trenches could be dug.Allen 1984, pp. 213‚Äì214 The II Battalion of the Japanese 58th Infantry Regiment had meanwhile captured Ukhrul from 50th Brigade's machine-gun company. Major General Miyazaki was present with the battalion. He was aware that there was a British brigade at Sangshak. Although Sangshak was in the sector assigned to 31st Division's neighbouring formation, the Japanese 15th Division, Miyazaki knew that this formation was lagging behind his force. He therefore decided to clear the British from Sangshak to prevent them interfering with his advance.Allen 1984, p.215 =Fighting at Sangshak= The Japanese battalion attacked Sangshak from the north on the night of 22 March. Miyazaki was prepared to wait for his regimental guns and some attached mountain guns to arrive to support the attack, but the battalion commander (Captain Nagaya) attacked hastily without artillery support. The British had a total of 46 mountain guns and 3-inch mortars with which to provide indirect fire support, and despite initial gains, the assaulting Japanese force suffered heavily from British artillery and mortar fire. One of the Japanese officers killed in the 50th Parachute Brigade's positions was found to be carrying vital maps and documents, which contained all of 31st Division's plans. Brigadier Hope- Thompson sent two copies of the documents through the encircling Japanese to IV Corps HQ in Imphal. These were to be vital to IV Corps' and Fourteenth Army's response to the Japanese attack on Kohima.Allen 1984, p.220Rooney 1992, p. 55 The next day (23 March), Allied aircraft tried to drop supplies to the 50th Parachute Brigade, but the brigade's position was so small that many of the supplies went to the Japanese. The Gurkhas of 152 Parachute Battalion attacked to recover them, supported by fighters which had escorted the transport aircraft. They were beaten back, but the Japanese also suffered heavy casualties.Allen 1984, p.216 Japanese artillery was moved into position using elephants, and began firing on Sangshak on 23 March.Rooney 1992, p. 54Seaman 1989, p. 81 On 24 March, the Japanese were reinforced by the III Battalion of the 58th Regiment, accompanied by the regimental commander and Miyazaki. They attacked immediately, but they too were repulsed. The III Battalion of the Japanese 60th Regiment, belonging to Masafumi Yamauchi's 15th Division, also began attacking the defended position from the east on 25 March, supported by artillery fire from two mountain guns from the 21st Field Artillery Regiment. Their commander (Major Fukushima) insisted that his officers properly reconnoitre the objective and plan their approachAllen 1984, p.217 in contrast to the 58th Regiment's hasty tactics. However, his infantry became lost trying to approach the position at night. During the following day, their two attached mountain guns destroyed many of the defenders' shallow trenches. On 26 March, Fukushima's infantry of the 60th Regiment again became lost trying to attack at night and were caught in the open at dawn.Allen 1984, p.218 The Japanese planned a last all-out assault on 27 March (although Miyazaki tried to insist that 58th Regiment alone should attack, so that they would have the sole honour of the victory), but ultimately this effort was unnecessary.Allen 1984, p.219 By that date, the defenders were exhausted and desperately short of water. There were 300 wounded in the position, and the smell of decomposing bodies (including those of the mules belonging to the attached mountain artillery, and supply column) was unbearable. At 6:00 pm on 26 March, Hope-Thompson received orders to withdraw. His brigade moved out under cover of darkness at 10.30 pm, with the 4th/5th Mahrattas providing a rearguard. About 100 wounded were left behind, although many others were carried out.Rooney 1992, p. 56 About 100 other men were captured by another battalion of the Japanese 60th Regiment (the \\"Uchibori battalion\\").Allen 1984, p. 221. The Japanese subsequently occupied the position after a patrol confirmed that it had been abandoned. Aftermath and results The 50th Indian Parachute Brigade had suffered 652 casualties.Singh 2014, p. 221 The Japanese reported capturing 100 prisoners, most of whom were wounded. The Japanese also captured plenty of air-dropped supplies which had missed the defenders at Sangshak, and other equipment including heavy weapons, vehicles and radios. Many of the Indian troops that were taken prisoner were later released ‚Äì albeit having been stripped of their equipment and clothes ‚Äì by the Japanese after they were forced to withdraw and were no longer able to spare troops to guard them.Rooney 1992, p. 57 Japanese casualties were also heavy. The II Battalion, 58th Regiment was the hardest-hit unit, with more than 400 casualties. However, the prolonged battle had also delayed Miyazaki's advance on Kohima by a week, and heavily depleted the 58th Regiment which would lead the attack.Rooney 1992, p. 58 It also delayed some of the 15th Division in their advance on Imphal. Miyazaki's Left Assault Force had the shortest and easiest route to Kohima. They arrived at the vital Kohima ridge only on April 3,Allen 1984, p. 230 by which time Allied reinforcements had also reached the area. In the ensuing Battle of Kohima, the Japanese failed to capture the entire ridge, and were eventually forced to retreat by British counter-attacks and shortage of food and ammunition.Rooney 1992, p. 103Allen 1984, p. 289 References Sources * Allen, Louis, Burma: The Longest War 1941‚Äì45, J.M.

Their son, Rob Jahrling, now lives in Australia and has represented that country in rowing at three Olympic Games. J√§hrling and Wilke got married in August 1980 soon after they both competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics. They later divorced. Rowing career He crewed the East German coxed pair boat with Friedrich-Wilhelm Ulrich and cox Georg Spohr that won the gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. For his Olympic success, he was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver (2nd class) by the state. At the 1977 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, the same team won a silver medal. In the following season, they were beaten by J√ºrgen Pfeiffer and Gert Uebeler (with cox Olaf Beyer) at national rowing regattas and thus moved across to the men's eight instead. J√§hrling became world champion with the eight at the 1978 World Rowing Championships in Cambridge, New Zealand. At the 1980 Summer Olympics, he won his second gold medal with the East German boat in the coxed pairs competition. He was once more awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver (2nd class) for his Olympic success. After his active career, J√§hrling worked as a rowing coach. With the German reunification, the East Germany rowing system collapsed and of some 200 coaches employed by the East German rowing association, only 28 were taken on afterwards. J√§hrling took a job with Rowing Australia. He was criticised for selecting Sally Robbins for the women's eight at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Precipitated silica is produced by precipitation from a solution containing silicate salts. The three main classes of amorphous silica are pyrogenic silica, precipitated silica and silica gel. Among them, precipitated silica has the greatest commercial significance. In 1999, more than one million tons were produced, half of it is used in tires and shoe soles.Otto W.

Like pyrogenic silica, precipitated silica is essentially not microporous (unless prepared by the St√∂ber process). Production The production of precipitated silica starts with the reaction of an neutral silicate solution with a mineral acid. Sulfuric acid and sodium silicate solutions are added simultaneously with agitation to water. Precipitation is carried out under acidic conditions. The choice of agitation, duration of precipitation, the addition rate of reactants, their temperature and concentration, and pH can vary the properties of the silica. The formation of a gel stage is avoided by stirring at elevated temperatures. The resulting white precipitate is filtered, washed and dried in the manufacturing process. : Na2(SiO2)7 \\\\+ H2SO4 \\\\+ O ‚Üí 7 SiO2 \\\\+ Na2SO4 \\\\+ H2O : Na2SiO3 \\\\+ H2SO4 ‚Üí SiO2 \\\\+ Na2SO4 \\\\+ H2O Properties The particles are porous.

Early life Eleanor Butler Alexander was born on December 26, 1888 in New York City, the only daughter of Henry Addison Alexander, a prominent New York lawyer, and Grace Green. She was a great-granddaughter of the late Theron Butler. Career Throughout her life Eleanor not only supported her husband's career but also proved a highly organized, socially conscious person in her own right. From July 1917 to December 1918, she was heavily involved in YMCA canteen work in France and was described by her fellow canteen worker Marian Baldwin as \\"working like a horse.\\" She helped improve the conditions of Puerto Rican women while her husband was governor of the island (1929‚Äì31); she organized the first American women's committee for China Relief (1937); and she directed the American Red Cross Club in England (1942).

Biography Ida was born on 13 August 1794 at Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany. Her father was George I, Duke of Saxe- Meiningen; and her mother was Luise Eleonore, daughter of Prince Christian of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. She was titled Princess Ida of Saxe-Meiningen, Duchess in Saxony with the style Serene Highness from her birth until the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15), when the entire House of Wettin was raised to the style of Highness. Her siblings were Adelaide (later wife of King William IV of the United Kingdom) and Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, with whom she maintained a close relationship. In Meiningen on 30 May 1816 she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, who served as a General in the Netherlands and she followed him in his various garrison cities during the following years; however, during the summer she lived in Liebenstein and Altenstein Palace, where she also remained when her husband made his North American tour. In 1830 she and her children participated in the coronation of her sister and brother-in-law in London, and from 1836 she moved to Liebenstein as her permanent summer residence. Thanks to her charitable activities, Ida was very popular among the population. On 22 June 1850 she was one of the godparents of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert; however, because was unable to be physically present, she was represented by the Duchess of Kent, mother of the Queen. Ida died of pneumonia in Weimar on 4 April 1852 aged 57. Her last words were: \\"I hope that this night would sleep well\\". She was buried in the Weimarer F√ºrstengruft. Two years later, in 1854, her brother Bernhard II erected the called Ida monument at the now ruined Burg Liebenstein. In 2004 the monument was extensively renovated.

Stagnosol (Ah-Bg1-Bgc-Bg2) Stagnosols are periodically wet and mottled in the topsoil and subsoil, with or without concretions and/or bleaching. The topsoil can also be completely bleached (albic horizon). A common name in many national classification systems for most Stagnosols is pseudogley. In the USDA soil taxonomy, many of them belong to the Aqualfs, Aquults, Aquents, Aquepts and Aquolls. They are developed in a wide variety of unconsolidated materials like glacial till, and loamy aeolian, alluvial and colluvial deposits and physically weathered siltstone. Stagnosols occur on flat to gently sloping land in cool temperate to subtropical regions with humid to perhumid climate conditions. The agricultural suitability of Stagnosols is limited because of their oxygen deficiency resulting from stagnating water above a dense subsoil. Therefore, they have to be drained. However, in contrast to Gleysols, drainage with channels or pipes is in many cases insufficient. It is necessary to have a higher porosity in the subsoil in order to improve the hydraulic conductivity. This may be achieved by deep loosening or deep ploughing. Drained Stagnosols can be fertile soils owing to their moderate degree of leaching. Stagnosols cover 150‚Äì200 million ha worldwide. For the greater part in humid to perhumid temperate regions of West and Central Europe, North America, southeast Australia and Argentina. Here Stagnosols are associated with Luvisols as well as silty to clayey Cambisols and Umbrisols. They also occur in humid to perhumid subtropical regions, where they are associated with Acrisols and Planosols. with a light-coloured, coarse-textured, surface horizon that shows signs of periodic water stagnation and abruptly overlies a dense, slowly permeable subsoil with significantly more clay than the surface horizon. In the US Soil Classification of 1938 used the name Planosols, whereas its successor, the USDA soil taxonomy, includes most Planosols in the Great Groups Albaqualfs, Albaquults and Argialbolls.

It was the first book of original poetry published by a woman in England. It was also the first book of poetry written by an English woman in an effort to attract a patron. The volume contains several short poems, each dedicated to a different woman, a long title poem Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum and the first English country house poem entitled \\"The Description of Cooke- ham\\".http://faculty.goucher.edu/eng211/ameilia_lanyer_sdrj.htm Poems Lady Anne Clifford. = Contents = *To the Queenes Most Excellent Majestie *To the Lady Elizabeths Grace *To All Vertuous Ladies in Generall *To the Ladie Arabella *To the Ladie Susan *The Authors Dream to the Lady Marie *To the Ladie Lucie *To the Ladie Margaret *To the Ladie Katherine *To the Ladie Anne *To the Vertuous Reader (prose) *Eve's Apology in Defense of Women *Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum *The Description of Cooke-ham *To the Doubtfull Reader (prose) = Description = As their titles suggest, the ten prefatory poems were each dedicated to a woman Lanier was inspired by, influenced by, or hoped to attract as a patron. These dedications were used to \\"assert the dignity and merit of all women\\" by declaring the greatness of the women she wrote to. Woods, xxxiii Eve by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1528 The title poem is a significantly longer work that focuses on the crucifixion of Jesus, a defence of women, and the importance of woman in the Biblical crucifixion narrative. Suzanne Woods observes that the poem is \\"meditating and expanding on the events from the female point of view,\\" which was a revolutionary retelling of the crucifixion at the time.Woods, xxxvii Lanier's defense of women shifts the blame of sin from Eve and onto Adam saying, \\"But surely Adam cannot be excus'd, / Her fault, though great, yet he was most too blame\\"luminarium.org Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum The poem goes on to explain that Adam should have avoided temptation since he is depicted as stronger than Eve in the Bible. Lanier strengthens her defence of women by praising the women in the crucifixion story who stood behind Jesus when his disciples forsook him. For example, Lanier's focus on Pilate's wife, a woman who attempts to persuade her husband not to crucify Jesus, shows Lanier's dedication to the recognition of women in the Bible even if they are nameless. Lanier's attention to the women in the poem characterizes her unique retelling of the biblical story. Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum is also noteworthy because, at the time of its writing, there were no other women who were writing about religious texts in the same way as Lanier. The Poetry Foundation states, \\"Apart from these English psalm translations, there was one other notable work of religious verse written before Lanyer's.\\"Poetry Foundation, √Ümilia Lanyer Therefore, Lanier's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was groundbreaking in the theological genre of poetry as well as English literature as a whole. = Reception = There is no indication of any recognition of Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum in Lanier's lifetime. It did not gain Lanier a fortune as her attempt to attract a patron suggests she wanted. The collection appears to have had an underwhelming reception due to the nontraditional nature of the poems. The British Library explains the writing by stating, \\"Lanier uses the language of piety and respect to mount a radical, self-assured ‚Äòdefence of Women‚Äô. The feminist style that scholars and researchers like those at the British Library attribute to Lanier is probably one of the reasons Salve \\"Deus Rex Judaeorum\\" was not well received. Lanier's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was, for the most part, forgotten for centuries. One scholar says, \\"[\\"Salve Deus Rex Judeaorum\\" was] consigned to oblivion for nearly four centuries, Lanyer has only in recent decades become the focus of a significant body of critical scholarship and achieved a presence in the mainstream of Renaissance poetry.\\" Although the reception to Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was poor, the work has come to claim an important place in the history of English literature. By the account of most scholars, researchers, and biographers Lanier's collection of poems was a groundbreaking text for feminism, literary tradition, and poetry overall. Salve Deus Rex Judeaorum was indeed forgotten for centuries, but it has finally achieved recognition thanks to carefully edited editions like that of Suzanne Woods and journal articles including \\"Remembering Aemilia Lanyer\\" by Kate Chedgzoy.Woods, The Poems of Aemilia Lanyer Chedgzoy, \\"Remembering Aemilia Lanyer\\" References External links *Full text of Salve Deus Rex Iud√¶orum 1611 books 1611 poems Cultural depictions of the Passion of Jesus English poetry collections Depictions of Jesus in literature ","title":"Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum"},{"id":"21192717","text":"Andreas Schulz (born 5 October 1951) is a German rower who competed for East Germany in the 1976 Summer Olympics.

The band also quotes the following musical influences: Cursive, My Bloody Valentine, Nirvana, Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Queens Of The Stone Age, David Bowie, Arcade Fire, Idlewild, Bj√∂rk, and Kate Bush. Formed in 2006, the band was composed of Owen Brinley (vocals/guitar), Lindsay Wilson (cello), James Field (drums) and Rory O'Hara (bass). Affiliated with the independent label Dance to the Radio, the band released a few singles prior to making its full-length debut album, released 24 March 2009. History The band was formed in early 2006 by Owen Brinley and Dominic Ord. Owen Brinley was the former singer of the now-defunct band Colour of Fire, under the name of Owen Richards. Owen and Dominic ran a popular monthly club night in York, called Grammar. This is where the name of the band comes from. However, the band made their live debut at Fibbers in York on 1 October 2006, under the name \\"Rose Parade\\" (named after the song from Elliott Smith‚Äôs Either/Or album). It was during the Grammar nights that Owen and Dom met bass player Rory O'Hara. Later on, Rebeca Dumican joined the band as cellist. A five-track promo EP was made, and the band was one of the 10 bands selected to play the Unsigned Stage at The Carling Weekend, the 2007 Leeds Festival. Whiskas, from the band Forward Russia and founder of the Dance To The Radio label, was one of the competition judges. Grammatics caught the label's attention and were soon signed to UK independent label Dance To The Radio. Grammatics' first commercial release was a four-track, Japan-only EP entitled Verity and Reverie. This was followed by a limited-edition 7\\" vinyl single featuring an early version of the track \\"Shadow Committee\\", released through Dance to the Radio in October 2007. The band performed twice on consecutive days at that year‚Äôs Leeds Festival. Singles D.I.L.E.M.M.A/Polar Swelling (a limited-edition double A-side 10\\" vinyl single), New Franchise (offered as a free download) and The Vague Archive were released as the band undertook several headlining tours of small UK venues. Following a string of sold-out limited-edition vinyl releases, Grammatics‚Äô self-titled debut album was released in March 2009. The album was recorded during June‚ÄìNovember 2008 in Bridlington, East Yorkshire with young producer James Kenosha (also drummer with Duels). Line up changes have now been completed, and the band were thought to be recording their second album. It has since been announced that the group were to split, playing final dates in August 2010. They supported the band Bloc Party on their British tour in October 2009. The band announced in July 2010 that after a final tour and EP, they would disband due to financial reasons, as well as members living in different cities. Brinley now performs as Department M (often written as Dept.M) and has released two albums, a self-titled debut on Fierce Panda and follow up 'Deep Control' on Hide & Seek records. Musical style Grammatics‚Äô music was based around Brinley‚Äôs complex but melodic songwriting style. Their sound veered between driving cello-led dissonant bombast and a more introverted, plaintive side.

Core Acacia members Sigsworth and Nilere had originally bonded over a mutual interest in John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen,Account of band history on Acacia's MySpace page, retrieved 30 January 2009 but retained their parallel (and more commercial) interest in \\"pop melodies with very strange arrangements.\\"\\"Guy Sigsworth: Bjork live\\" (interview in Sound On Sound magazine, published May 1996, retrieved 30 January 2009) Nilere had first learned to play the guitar to Chinese and Balinese scales (before being introduced to R'n'B forms) and the band's songs were strongly influenced by this factor.Acacia biography @ New Musical Express , retrieved 3 April 2009 The band were known to describe their sound as \\"liquid music\\", due to the distinctive \\"underwater tabla\\" sound. Nilere once described Acacia as \\"a fourth world band, because the music's alien to everyone.\\" History =Roots and formation= Alexander Nilere (the son of a wealthy and prominent Nigerian family based in the UK) had originally been scheduled to travel to America and study medicine. More interested in music, he fooled his parents by faking his departure from Heathrow Airport and subsequently settled in the London squat scene.Account of band history on Acacia's MySpace page, retrieved 30 January 2009 During this period, he was introduced to Guy Sigsworth, a former harpsichord student obsessed by Stravinsky and electronic music. Sigsworth had already made a considerable mark for himself as a rising keyboard player, songwriter and junior producer on the British pop scene. In 1991, he had played and recorded with Bomb The Bass and Seal (co-writing the latter's hit single \\"Crazy\\"), and had followed this up in 1992 by working with Hector Zazou, Naked Truth and Seal's former musical partner Adamski. By the time he met Nilere, he had moved on to become Bj√∂rk's keyboard player and musical director of her live band. Initially forming Acacia as a duo project, Nilere and Sigsworth subsequently recruited Maurizio Anzalone (a self-taught Spanish/Italian guitarist who'd developed a playing style blending punk and the avant-garde). As percussionist, they recruited future world-music/British- Asian club music star Talvin Singh, who'd already established himself as a live performer with Siouxsie And The Banshees, Bj√∂rk and the On-U Sound System. Singh stayed with Acacia for \\"about three gigs\\". He was replaced by another British Asian: Ansuman Biswas, an experimental poet and performance artist who happened to play tabla, percussion and santoor. =Early singles= Acacia spent much of 1993 working on their music, and subsequently began to sell it via home-made cassette. They released their debut single, \\"Maddening Shroud\\" in April 1994 - a song fusing Balkan gypsy voices and gamelans to \\"an insistent nursery rhyme melody\\". \\"Maddening Shroud\\" was followed with a witty electronic soul-pop cover of Morrissey's \\"The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get\\". Both singles, plus the interest built up by the band's compelling live concerts, attracted enough attention and then a deal from London label Radar Records. This gave Sigsworth enough immediate financial security to enable him to leave Bj√∂rk's live band and to begin recording Acacia's debut album in his home studio at a basement flat near Abbey Road Studios. =Singles for Radar Records= Acacia's third single (and their first release for Radar Records) was 1995's \\"Hate\\" EP. By this time, Acacia had gained a part-time fifth member in the shape of backing singer Imogen Heap, who was recruited to the project by Sigsworth after he had heard her voice on a demo tape. Although Heap would never become a full-time member of the band, she was featured prominently on almost every song the band recorded from then on, and would perform at Acacia's live gigs whenever possible. Members of Acacia would return the favour by performing in Heap's backing band for her 1996 showcase at the Prince's Trust Concert in Hyde Park, London. Acacia's fourth single, released later in 1996, was \\"Sway\\", a song of bisexual intrigue which gained the band some more press attention (although not much mainstream attention). =Line-up changes and further singles= Maurizio Anzalone left the band following the release of \\"Sway\\". He was replaced by Luca Ramelli - an Italian guitarist and sound designer based in London - who finished off the remaining guitar tracks on the album. Shortly afterward Ansuman Biswas also left the band to resume his solo work. Biswas was replaced by versatile session drummer/percussionist Eshan Khadaroo (aka Eshan K).Account of life in Acacia on Luca Ramelli's MySpace page, retrieved 30 January 2009 Signing a new deal with Warner Music UK, the new Acacia lineup re-recorded their first single, \\"Maddening Shroud\\". This gained the band the most interest they'd received so far and was promoted by a striking video. The band also played a UK tour and also played two concerts in Los Angeles at the Viper Room and Whiskey (as part of a possible deal with Interscope Records). A sixth single - the rave-inflected \\"Wired\\" - followed. =Cradle, and the end of the band= Completed in 1996, the Acacia debut album - Cradle - was released in early 1997 and looked set to take the band to the next stage. However, problems with contract issues between Warner Music UK and Interscope were revealed which caused the album to be pulled from record stores at the last moment. (Enough copies of the album reached press and public to generate a few reviews and promote some mild cult interest.) While the details of the legal problems are yet to be disclosed, they proved to be serious enough to entirely halt Acacia's career. With their impetus and opportunity apparently lost, the members of Acacia opted to split up the band. =Life after Acacia= The breakup of Acacia was entirely amicable, with several members continuing to work together on other projects. In particular, Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere maintained their writing partnership, working together on songs for both Imogen Heap and for British soul singer Hinda Hicks. Post-Acacia, Sigsworth also resumed his work as keyboard player and producer, going on to work with Mandalay, Badmarsh & Shri, Goldie, Robyn and Lamb. He has since moved into the premier league of pop sessions and productions thanks to his collaborations with Britney Spears, Alanis Morissette and Madonna (for the latter, he co-wrote and produced the smash hit single \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\"). During the last days of Acacia, Sigsworth and Imogen Heap had been working on Heap's debut solo album I Megaphone, for which Sigsworth co-wrote and produced the debut single \\"Getting Scared\\". Sigsworth and Heap subsequently formed the pop duo Frou-Frou (who recorded a cover of \\"Maddening Shroud\\" for their Details album). Although Frou Frou was a short-lived project (due to problems with record companies and Heap's desire to produce herself) the two remain friends and occasional collaborators. Alexander Nilere went on (under the new pseudonym of \\"Blackmoth\\") to form the R'n'B/club music project Hexdragon with Nellee Hooper, which produced the singles \\"Da Boogaloo\\" and \\"Two Summers\\". Unfortunately, the debut Hexdragon album suffered the same fate as Acacia's Cradle and was pulled on the eve of its release for undisclosed reasons. Alternating between his own name and the Blackmoth pseudonym, Nilere then went on to a solo career and has also worked with Bj√∂rk, Peyton, Saian Supa Crew and The Prodigy. After his stint in Acacia, Eshan Khadaroo went on to drum with Blue Man Group, Bow Wow Wow, Psapp, Incognito, Jon Hassell, Bonnie McKee, Gemma Hayes, Badmarsh & Shri and his former Acacia bandmate Imogen Heap. He is one of the many members of Cirque Du Soleil.Biography on Eshan K's Beat Kitchen website, retrieved 31 January 2009 Both Talvin Singh and Ansuman Biswas resumed their own solo careers after leaving Acacia. Luca Ramelli left London to return to Italy in 1999. He now mostly creates music for commercials and fashion events, but remains very enthusiastic about Acacia and has expressed interest in participating in a reunion should it ever happen. In 2012, Acacia finally regained rights to their recordings and began a reissue programme.

The inscription running around the rim of the bell has been identified as old Tamil. Translated, it says \\"Mohoyiden Buks ship‚Äôs bell\\". Some of the characters in the inscription are of an archaic form no longer seen in modern Tamil script, thus suggesting that the bell could be about 500 years old, possibly from the Later Pandya period.

The bell might have been dropped off the shore by a Portuguese ship, whose sailors had been in touch with the Indians.

It claims lineage to the historical party of the same name which was active between 1861 and 1929 and which advocated the right to self-determination at the time when Croatia was part of Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There were other briefly active splinter parties with the same name in the early 20th century which often changed forms and merged with each other but were eventually all disbanded by 1929. Since the early 1990s and the foundation of the contemporary party a number of right-wing factions have also splintered from it or formed nationalist parties independently, using the name in some form, as they all claim to be the \\"true\\" adherents to the ideology of the original 19th-century party. In Croatia the name is usually taken to refer to either the historical party or the 1990 party as it is the only party to date carrying that name which managed to win seats in the Croatian Parliament. Smaller parties carrying the name generally receive marginal coverage in the local media even though they regularly run in both local and general elections. In addition, some of these parties also operate similarly named branches in Bosnia and Herzegovina, usually on a nationalist platform promoting interests of Bosnian Croats and regularly running in the Bosnian general elections. Note that the native name of all these parties contains the word prava which is the both singular and plural genitive form of the word pravo (which in English means \\"right\\" - as in the \\"right to self-determination\\"). Because of this the name is regarded as a singular in Croatia (literally \\"Croatian Party of Right\\"), but commonly appears in English in the plural form, probably to distinguish it from the English term \\"Right\\" which is generally used for right-wing ideology. Nevertheless, both historical and contemporary parties carrying the name are considered representatives of the conservative, nationalist, or even far-right side of the political spectrum.

An earnest preoccupied man may converse: an over- excited or coarse-minded man may talk; but neither the one nor the other can causer in the precise French acceptation of the word. Boswell says, 'Though his (Johnson's) usual phrase for conversation was 'talk,' yet he made a distinction; for when he once told me that he dined the day before at a friend's house, with 'a very pretty company,' and I asked him if there was good conversation, he answered, 'No, sir, we had 'talk' but no conversation; there was nothing discussed.' On another occasion, however, when he said there had been good 'talk,' Boswell rejoined, 'Yes, sir, you tossed and gored several persons.' Positiveness, loudness, love of argument and eagerness for display, are fatal to causerie; which we take to consist in the easy, careless, unforced flow of remarks, fancies, feelings, or thoughts, ‚Äì the results of reading, observation, or reflection [...] In Strictness, therefore, perhaps the title of causeries should only be given to such a book as we should call 'Table-Talk'.\\" ‚Äî Hayward, Abraham (1873). \\"Varieties of History and Art.\\" In: Biographical and Critical Essays, Vol., II. London: Longmans, Green & Co., pp. 1‚Äì2. A causerie is generally short, light and humorous and is often published as a newspaper column (although it is not defined by its format). Often the causerie is a current-opinion piece, but it contains more verbal acrobatics and humor than a regular opinion or column. In English, causerie is commonly known as \\"personal story\\", \\"talk of the town\\",Kinnunen, Aarne: ‚ÄùPakina.‚Äù Otavan Suuri Ensyklopedia 7, pp. 5011‚Äì5012. Helsinki: Otava, 1979. \\"funny story\\" or \\"column\\" instead. The causerie style is characterized by a personal approach to the reader; the writer \\"babbles\\" to the reader, from which the term derives. Language jokes, hyperbole, intentional disregard of linguistic and stylistic norms, and other absurd or humorous elements are permitted. For example, in a causerie about a politician, she or he may be placed in an imagined situation. Sentences are usually kept short, avoiding over-explaining, and room is left for the reader to read between the lines. The content of causerie is not limited and it may be satire, parody, opinion, factual or straight fiction. Causerie is not defined by content or format, but style. Although usually published in a newspaper, many authors have published anthologies. The causerie as a form became popular in the English-speaking world during the later nineteenth-century following the widely published and influential essays of Andrew Lang.

His extensive work on the genus Salix led to several plants being named in his honour.W.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', Botanical Gazette, 21 (1896), pp.\\\\53-66  Biography  Michael Schuck Bebb was born on December 23, 1833 in Butler County, Ohio, one of five children to William Bebb and Sarah Schuck.Year: 1850; Census Place: Fairfield, Butler, Ohio; Roll: M432_663; Page: 235; Image: 236. His formative years were spent on the family farm in Hamilton, Ohio, where his interest in horticultural subjects took root amidst ‚Äúthe pleasure grounds, vegetable and fruit gardens‚Äù and ‚Äúwell stocked greenhouse‚Äù.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p55 Through his uncle, Evan Bebb, the young Bebb received a complete set of the Natural History Reports of the State of New York and Emerson‚Äôs Trees and Shrubs of Massachusetts. These books opened up the hitherto unknown world of botany to the sixteen-year-old, who could now trace the genera and species of given plants and learn from their relationship. Applying this new found knowledge to the trees, shrubs and herbs around him, Bebb began work collecting and preparing specimens for his famous herbarium of later years.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p56 During this time his father, William Bebb had become active in politics and campaigned for the Whig politician William Henry Harrison in 1836 and 1840. In 1846 he himself was elected Governor of Ohio, only the third governor born in the state. After declining a second term in office, Governor Bebb withdrew from public life and moved his family to his newly acquired estate Fountaindale in Winnebago County, Illinois. Instead of travelling with the family along the regular route to the estate via the Miami canal, the seventeen-year-old Michael Schuck Bebb assisted his brother in law in driving a herd of short horn cattle four hundred miles into the state of Illinois. This epic journey opened up new and exciting species of flora to the young man and further fuelled his growing passion for botany.C.T.Foreman,'Robert Bebb', http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v021/v021p052.pdf During his time at Fountaindale, Michael acquired four standard books, Wood‚Äôs Class Book of Botany, Gray‚Äôs Botanical Text Book and Manual, Torrey and Gray‚Äôs Flora of North America and Gray‚Äôs Genera Illustrata, which enabled him to develop into a trained and skilled veteran of natural flora.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p57 During his time attending Beloit College in Wisconsin, he became acquainted with Dr.George Vasey, after a chance encounter at a local state fair. A short time later, Michael received a collection of grasses, sedges and junci from Dr. Vasey. Their correspondence and exchanges would continue through the years. As well as Dr. Vasey, Bebb also corresponded with a number of other noted botanists over the years including Dr.Asa Gray, William M. Canby and Henry Nicholas Bolander.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p59 In 1857, he married Katherine Josephine Hancock, a member of the celebrated Massachusetts family of the same name and in 1861 moved the family to Washington where Michael was employed in the Pensions office.C.T.Foreman,'Robert Bebb', http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v021/v021p052.pdf During his free time, Michael continued to collect plants and to correspond and exchange with the leading botanists of the day. He joined the Naturalists‚Äô Club and became well known amongst the scientific community in Washington.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p58 In 1865, his wife died, leaving him the sole guardian of their three children. He resigned from the Pensions office and on February 19, 1867 married Anna Carpenter and moved the whole family to the Fountaindale estate in Illinois.C.T.Foreman,'Robert Bebb', http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v021/v021p052.pdf It was here, in 1873 that Bebb began his special study of willows, corresponding with the eminent British authority on Salix, Rev. J.E. Leefe. In 1874 he was asked to contribute his salices to Brewer and Watson‚Äôs Botany of California by Dr. Asa Gray, and in the same year he published his first scientific paper on willows in The American Naturalist, entitled ‚ÄúA new species of willow (S.laevigata) from California, and notes on some other North American species.‚ÄùDeane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p60 In 1878 he began to contribute writings to the Botanical Gazette on various aspects of willows. These included six papers entitled ‚ÄúNotes on North American willows.‚Äù His work on willows also appeared in Rothrock‚Äôs Botany of the Wheeler Report and in the Botany of California as well as his illustrations in the Gray's Manual Flora. In 1880 the leading Swedish authority on salices, Nils J. Anderson died, leaving Michael Schuck Bebb as the eminent botanist on the genus salix.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p61 In October 1879 the family moved from Fountaindale to Rockford, Illinois. The financial strain of a farm the size of Fountaindale proved too costly for Bebb and he eventually sold the property to a practical farmer.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p61 In 1885 he suffered a serious attack of pleurisy, to which he never fully recovered, though this did not hamper his botanical zeal, publishing four series of ‚ÄúNotes on the White Mountain willows‚Äù in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club between 1888 and 1890, and contributed the Salices to the sixth edition of Gray's Manual, also in 1890.Deane, 'Michael Schuck Bebb', p62 Towards the end of his life, his industrious work on the genus Salix was rewarded by the naming of several plants in his honour.C.T.Foreman,'Robert Bebb', http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v021/v021p052.pdf In 1885 the genus Bebbia, native to Southern California was named in his honour by Prof. E.

Bailey and in 1895, Salix Bebbiana published by Prof. C. S.

In the 1970s The Tabernacle became a community arts centre, leased on a peppercorn rent from Kensington and Chelsea Council by a management committee made up of local enthusiasts. The committee hired the Tabernacle's only complete (small) hall to local community groups to raise funds for further development of the building and to run basic services, for example employing a youth worker to coordinate programmes for the children of local residents in what was at the time an extremely disadvantaged neighbourhood. The rival Carnival Arts Committee and Carnival Development Committee both made use of the venue each year in the weeks leading up to the Notting Hill Carnival featuring bands such as the Mangrove steel band. Despite the injection of considerable energy and goodwill by a wide range of local groups, the Tabernacle had a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence, and in the late 1970s the main hall was still undeveloped, stripped of its seating and not in daily use.

Alternative Medicine on Trial (North American title: Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine) is a 2008 book about alternative medicine by Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst.  Overview  The book evaluates the scientific evidence for acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and chiropractic, and briefly covers 36 other treatments. It finds that the scientific evidence for these alternative treatments is generally lacking. Homeopathy is concluded to be completely ineffective: \\"It's nothing but a placebo, despite what homeopaths say\\". Although Trick or Treatment presents evidence that acupuncture, chiropractic and herbal remedies have limited efficacy for certain ailments, the authors conclude that the dangers of these treatments outweigh any potential benefits. Such potential risks outlined by the authors are contamination or unexpected interactions between components in the case of herbal medicine, risk of infection in the case of acupuncture and the potential for chiropractic manipulation of the neck to cause delayed stroke. The book is very critical of Prince Charles' advocacy of alternative medicine and the actions of his now-defunct The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. Trick or Treatment is dedicated, in an ironic fashion, to the Prince.  Contents  The book contains six chapters: How do you determine the truth? :This chapter describes the methods and history of clinical trials, such as the trial to determine a proper treatment for scurvy by James Lind and the story of Florence Nightingale. James Lind was a British physician who pioneered naval hygiene. He recommended that citrus fruit and lemon juice should be included in the diets of seamen to eradicate the illness of scurvy. Lind was able to come to the conclusion that these remedies may reduce this particular illness through the various clinical trials he performed that were successful. Florence Nightingale is another example used in the novel as someone who practiced the scientific medicine and evidence based medicine as she pioneered the profession of nursing. The truth about acupuncture :This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding acupuncture, a form of alternative medicine in which acupuncturists place needles in the body for the purpose of blocking Ch'i meridians throughout the body, thus encouraging full health. The authors examine the recent history of acupuncture and several various trials of the technique. The authors conclude that acupuncture is essentially a placebo. The truth about homeopathy :This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding homeopathy, an alternative medicine technique which consists of finding a substance (which causes symptoms similar to the condition needing to be treated in a healthy person), then diluting that substance to an extreme degree. The chapter examines the history of homeopathy and reviews various trials regarding the technique, especially the trial done by Jacques Benveniste, a French researcher. The authors conclude that homeopathy is a placebo. The authors offered a ¬£10,000 prize for anyone who could prove homeopathy was effective.http://www.trickortreatment.com/challenge.html The truth about chiropractic therapy :This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding chiropractic, an alternative medicine technique which aims to cure illness by manipulating the spine, based on the theory that almost all conditions and diseases are caused by misaligned vertebrae in the spine block the body's vital force. The history of chiropractic, as well as several of the trials on chiropractic are described. The authors conclude that there is no evidence to support most of chiropractic's claims. However, the authors state that chiropractic might be beneficial in certain limited situations concerning back pain. As well, the authors find that chiropractic can be very dangerous, especially when it comes to the manipulation of the neck, and state that patients should \\"try conventional treatments before turning to a chiropractor for back pain.\\"Singh, Simon & Edzard Ernst. Trick or Treatment. 2008. Page 170. The truth about herbal medicine :This chapter discusses the evidence surrounding herbal medicine, such as the use of St. John's Wort and Aloe vera. The authors conclude that several herbal medicines can be effective to treat illness, while others, such as billberry, chamomile, and ginseng, are ineffective. Does the truth matter? :This chapter discusses the state of alternative medicine in society, focusing on Prince Charles's endorsements of alternative medicine.  Reception  The book received generally good reviews. The New England Journal of Medicines review said this about the authors: \\"Simon Singh is a physicist and science journalist, and his coauthor, Edzard Ernst, is a physician and professor of complementary medicine. Ernst is one of the best qualified people to summarize the evidence on this topic.\\" The Daily Telegraph found the book to be \\"a clearly written, scrupulously scientific examination of the health claims of key areas of alternative medicine: acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic therapy and herbal medicine. The results are stark. In no case, apart from in some limited ways in herbal medicine, do any of these 'therapies‚Äô work. On the contrary, they can be life- threatening.\\" The journal Nature tempered a generally positive review with a concern that the authors' sense of certainty \\"mirrors that of the proponents of alternative therapies, leaving each position as entrenched as ever.\\" Trick or Treatment drew criticism from consumers and practitioners of alternative therapies. The British Journal of General Practice published a review by Jeremy Swayne (former dean of the Faculty of Homeopathy) that was critical of the book and its argument. A review by Harriet A. Hall on Quackwatch stated that some negative reviews of Trick or Treatment demonstrated \\"an appalling poverty of thought\\"; articulating that since the reasoning behind the author's conclusions is solid, critics instead deny the methods of science, misrepresent the book's contents and use ad hominem attacks against the authors.  Subsequent libel case and freedom of speech  Singh was sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association for comments he wrote in a column in The Guardian about the book. In 2010, after 2 years, the BCA dropped the case after the court of the appeal found that Singh was expressing opinion, rather than stating facts. The presiding judges commented that \\"this litigation has almost certainly had a chilling effect on public debate which might otherwise have assisted potential patients to make informed choices about the possible use of chiropractic\\".

Saint Peter's Basilica. The World Day of the Sick is an awareness day, or observance, in the Catholic Church which was instituted on May 13, 1992 by Pope John Paul II. Beginning in 1993, it is celebrated every year on February 11, the memorial of Our Lady of Lourdes. It is not a liturgical celebration, but it seeks to be for all believers \\"a special time of prayer and sharing, of offering one's suffering\\".1993 Message History Pope John Paul II had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease as early as 1991, an illness which was only disclosed later, and it is significant that he decided to create the World Day of the Sick only one year after his diagnosis.Disabled World The pope had written a great deal on the topic of suffering and believed that it was very much a salvific and redeeming process through Christ, as he indicated in his apostolic letter Salvifici Doloris.https://web.archive.org/web/20050930062256/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp- ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html He chose the memorial of Our Lady of Lourdes for the date of the observance because many pilgrims and visitors to Lourdes, France, have been reported to have been healed at the Marian Sanctuary there through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin. The pope also venerated the sanctuary of Harissa in Lebanon. In 2005, the World Day of the Sick had a special significance since the ailing pope later died on April 2 of that year. Many people had gathered in St. Peter's Square in Rome to pray for him as he laid dying. In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation on this day, and he gave his declining health as his reason for retiring.

She served in the Channel, where she captured a small privateer, and in the East Indies, where she participated in the capture of Isle de France (now Mauritius) and the operations around it. She was wrecked in 1822. Service Racehorse was commissioned in March 1806 under Commander Robert Forbes, who sailed her for the Mediterranean on 25 May. By June 1807 she was under Captain William Fisher, cruising in the Channel. Racehorse was among the vessels that detained the Danish ships Die Twende Softre on 28 August, and Swannen on 7 September. On 4 December she recaptured the Portuguese ship Gloria. On 2 March 1808 Racehorse captured the French privateer lugger Amiral Gantheaume off the Seven Islands, which are 16 miles west of Behat. Amiral Gantheume was armed with four guns and had a crew of 28 men. She was two days out of Granville and had not taken anything. Racehorse then cruised the Channel Islands. Fisher sailed for the Cape of Good Hope on 29 September. There a number of her crew volunteered aboard other ships during the Invasion of Ile de France. On 13 and 14 March 1809, Racehorse was in company with her class-mate, , about 1000 miles from Rodrigues. Harrier fell behind and this was the last sighting of her; she was lost, presumed foundered. In December 1810, Commander James de Rippe replaced Fisher. Racehorse was sent to Mauritius to join the squadron there under James Hillyar that had been assembled to attack the French squadron under Francois Roquebert that was expected from Brest. Early in 1811 Racehorse was in company with her sister-ship Elipse when Eclipse recaptured the Donna Emilia. On 3 February, Racehorse captured the slaver Othmany. The French squadron evaded Hillyar, but Racehorse and the rest of the squadron, now under Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg, caught them off Tamatave in Madagascar. In the ensuing Action of 20 May 1811, the British defeated the French and captured two of their ships. Racehorse was not heavily engaged, and suffered no casualties. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Off Tamatave 20 May 1811\\" to the remaining survivors of that action. Racehorse was present at the capture of the N√©r√©ide three days later. Racehorse then sailed for the Cape on 7 August. On 19 September she and captured the French slaver brig Eclair. On 5 January 1812 Eclipse, with Racehorse in company, took the lugger Eliza with 145 slaves, which she sent to the Cape of Good Hope.Metropolitan Trust Company (London, England). Report of the directors, Volumes 6-9, p.39. Racehorse captured the American ship Monticello on 12 November. Racehorse also shared in the proceeds of the capture, on 16 November, of Valentine. On 3 February 1813, Racehorse was under the command of Commander George F. Rich, and in company with , under the command of Commander Samuel Hoare. They captured the American ship Rose, which was carrying tea and 8907 Spanish dollars (worth approximately ¬£2226). On 15 August 1813 Racehorse sailed from the Cape of Good Hope as escort to several vessels, including bound for St Helena and Britain.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4815. Post- war Racehorse was paid off into ordinary at Portsmouth in 1813. She was recommissioned in May under Commander George Pryse Campbell, who took command on 5 May, for the Mediterranean. Racehorse came under the command of Commander Charles Abbot on 27 January 1821 when Campbell was promoted to post-captain. Fate Racehorse returned to Britain in 1822 under Captain William Suckling, who had taken command in February 1822. On 14 December 1822 she sailed from Holyhead, Anglesey, bound for the Isle of Man to meet with the Revenue cutter Vigilant. That night she was wrecked on a reef of rocks off Langness on the Isle of Man. Her pilot mistook the light on Langness Pier for the light on Douglas Pier. Boats from Racehorse took a number of the crew to shore, and five intrepid local men made four trips out and back to rescue more. On the last trip, with Suckling on board, the boat overturned in the surf. Six men from Racehorse drowned, as did three rescuers from Castletown. The subsequent court martial reprimanded the Master, Henry Hodder, for failing to take constant depth soundings, and warned him to be more careful in the future. The court martial severely reprimanded the pilot, William Edwards, for sailing too close to land, and mulcted him of all pay due. There is a detailed account of the loss of the Racehorse in Janet Gleeson's book The Lifeboat Baronet - Launching the R.N.L.I. Whilst the author indicates that RNLI founder Sir William Hillary was not present at this particular event, living elsewhere on the Isle of Man, she argues that the shipwreck was undoubtedly a significant contributing factor to his desire to set up a national lifesaving organisation.

Cannula transfer or cannulation is a subset of air-free techniques used with a Schlenk line, in transferring liquid or solution samples between reaction vessels via cannulae, avoiding atmospheric contamination. While the syringes are not the same as cannulae, the techniques remain relevant. There are two methods of transfer: vacuum, and pressure. Both utilize differences in pressures between two vessels to push the fluid through. Often, the main difficulty encountered is slow transfer due to the high viscosity of the fluid. Equipment =Septa= A rubber septum. The top folds over the neck of a flask to give an airtight sealSepta (singular: septum) are rubber stoppers which seal flasks or bottles. They give an airtight seal, preventing the ingress of the atmosphere, but are able to be pierced by sharp needles or cannulae. =Cannula= Cannulae are hollow flexible tubes of varying bore, usually 16-22 gauge thick. They are commonly made of stainless steel or PTFE for chemical resistance. Stainless steel cannulae are usually 2‚Äì3 feet long, due to their relative inflexibility, while PTFE cannulae can be much shorter. The ends are usually sharp and non-coring, allowing them to easily pierce a rubber septum, without being clogged by rubber particles. Flat ends may be chosen on occasion, because they tend to provide more complete transfer of fluids. Stainless steel cannulae tend to collapse when cut with wire cutters. They are best cut using pipecutters of appropriate size. Other workers recommend deeply scoring the cannula with a triangular file, then sharply snapping the weakened section. =Needles and syringes= Wide-bore needles of similar gauge are often used. Unlike hypodermic-type needles sometimes used in the chemistry laboratory, these needles tend to be reused due to cost. Long needles may be flexible enough to be bent in U-shapes; shorter needles often are not. Polypropylene syringes used for medical applications are least expensive. While the material is relatively solvent-resistant, though they are designed primarily for aqueous solutions, some degradation or leaching by the contents may occur. In particular, the black rubber seal may swell and cause the plunger to seize. All-glass gas-tight syringes have better solvent resistance, though they tend to leak more than plastic syringes. Greases used on the barrel may leach into the contents. Glass syringes with a teflon seal at the plunger are available as well, but they are more expensive. They tend to be used for microsyringes (usually containing less than 100 ŒºL). Luer fittings are preferred, as needles are locked in even under higher pressure, e.g. when transferring viscous liquids. =Cleaning and storage= Cannulae and needles should be quickly flushed out with an appropriate solvent to prevent undetectable corrosion damage to the stainless steel. Since they are usually used for air-sensitive work, they are commonly kept in a hot oven, to reduce the adsorption of water molecules. Before use, they are usually subjected to three vacuum-refill cycles to remove any traces of air.  Cannula transfer methods  = Vacuum based = The two ends of the cannula are inserted through the septa covering donating and receiving flasks. The cannula extends below the surface of the fluid to be transferred. A vacuum is applied to the receiving flask, and the low pressure relative to the donating flask causes the fluid to flow through the cannula. The main drawback of vacuum transfer is that if there are any leaks, air will be drawn into the system and spoil the air-free environment. Loss of the fluid by evaporation is another problem, though less so where the fluid is a neat liquid, than a solution of known concentration. = Positive pressure = The two ends of the cannula are connected similarly. The receiving flask is connected to its own gas bubbler, while the donating flask is connected to a source of inert gas. By increasing the inert gas pressure, the pressure within the donating flask is raised higher than the receiving flask, and the fluid is forced through the cannula. The main drawback of pressure transfer, is that transfer can be slow due to the small pressure difference between donating and receiving flasks. Inert gas lines are usually vented out of a gas bubbler placed in-line to prevent overpressure. The vents need to be isolated by capping the bubbler outlet, or stopping the egress of inert gas with a stopcock or pinch clamp, to ensure sufficient pressure to complete the transfer. The use of a mercury bubbler instead of one filled with oil used to be popular, but is out of favor due to the difficulty in dealing with mercury spills. = Syphoning = By carefully filling the cannula fully with either above techniques, then allowing the pressures within the vessels to equalize, a syphon may be set up. This arrangement allows the slow addition of a fluid to a reaction vessel; the rate of addition may be controlled by adjusting the relative height of the donor vessel. Syringe transfer Fluids may also be transferred via syringes; at all times a slight over-pressure of inert gas is maintained to prevent the ingress of moisture or air, as well as providing refill volume. This method is also applicable for transferring fluids from bottles similar to the Aldrich Sure/Seal-type. Prior to withdrawing the needle for subsequent transfer, the needle bore is usually filled with inert gas to serve as a buffer from the atmosphere. Handling pyrophoric material While handling pyrophoric material (e.g. tert- butyllithium and trimethylaluminum), traces of the compound at the tip of the needle or cannula may catch fire, and cause a clog. Some workers prefer to contain the tip of the needle or cannula in a short glass tube flushed with an inert gas, and sealed via two septa. Instead of exposing the needle tip to the air, it is withdrawn into the inerted tube. Where desired, it may be inserted into a flask via two septa (one on the tube, one on the flask). Used this way, needle tip fires are eliminated, reducing the obvious hazards. Also, there is a reduced tendency for the needle tip to clog due to the reaction of traces of the reagent with air to give salts. Filtration Filtration is most easily accomplished using a syringe filter. PTFE filters tend to be most chemically resistant; nylon filters are less so. Using a cannula, a filter stick Air-free technique#Gallery may be used. A filter stick is a short length of glass tubing sealed on one end with a septum, and sealed on the other with filter paper, or a sintered glass frit. For larger volumes, it may be preferable to connect the donor and receiving flasks via ground glass joints to a sintered glass filter tube.

She was the daughter of Lord Edmund Howard and Joyce Culpeper, cousin to Anne Boleyn (the second wife of Henry VIII), and niece to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Howard was a prominent politician at Henry's court, and he secured her a place in the household of Henry's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, where she caught the King's interest. She married him on 28 July 1540 at Oatlands Palace in Surrey, just 19 days after the annulment of his marriage to Anne. He was 49, and she was still a teenager, at about 17 years old. Catherine was stripped of her title as queen in November 1541. She was beheaded three months later on the grounds of treason for committing adultery with her distant cousin Thomas Culpeper. Family life Catherine was one of the daughters of Lord Edmund Howard ( ‚Äì 1539) and Joyce Culpeper ( ‚Äì ). Her father's sister, Elizabeth Howard, was the mother of Anne Boleyn. Therefore, Catherine Howard was the first cousin of Anne Boleyn, and the first cousin once removed of Lady Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I), Anne's daughter by Henry VIII. She also was the second cousin of Jane Seymour, as her grandmother Elizabeth Tilney was the sister of Seymour's grandmother Anne Say. As a granddaughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk (1443‚Äì1524), Catherine had an aristocratic pedigree. Her father was not wealthy, being the third son among 21 children and disfavoured in the custom of primogeniture, by which the eldest son inherits all his father's estate. When Catherine's parents married, her mother already had five children from her first husband, Ralph Leigh ( ‚Äì 1509); she went on to have another six with Catherine's father, Catherine being about her mother's tenth child. With little to sustain the family, her father was often reduced to begging for handouts from his more affluent relatives. After Catherine's mother died in 1528, her father married twice more. In 1531 he was appointed Controller of Calais. He was dismissed from his post in 1539, and died in March 1539. Catherine was the third of Henry VIII's wives to have been a member of the English nobility or gentry; Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were royalty from continental Europe. Early life Catherine was probably born in Lambeth in about 1523, but the exact date of her birth is unknown. Soon after the death of her mother (in about 1528), Catherine was sent with some of her siblings to live in the care of her father's stepmother, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk. The Dowager Duchess presided over large households at Chesworth House in Horsham in Sussex, and at Norfolk House in Lambeth where dozens of attendants, along with her many wards‚Äîusually the children of aristocratic but poor relatives‚Äîresided. While sending young children to be educated and trained in aristocratic households other than their own was common for centuries among European nobles, supervision at both Chesworth House and Lambeth was apparently lax. The Dowager Duchess was often at Court and seems to have had little direct involvement in the upbringing of her wards and young female attendants. As a result of the Dowager Duchess's lack of discipline, Catherine became influenced by some older girls who allowed men into the sleeping areas at night for entertainment. The girls were entertained with food, wine, and gifts stolen from the kitchens. Catherine was not as well educated as some of Henry's other wives, although, on its own, her ability to read and write was impressive enough at the time. Her character has often been described as vivacious, giggly and brisk, but never scholarly or devout. She displayed great interest in her dance lessons, but would often be distracted during them and make jokes. She also had a nurturing side for animals, particularly dogs. In the Duchess's household at Horsham, in around 1536, Catherine began music lessons with two teachers, one of whom was Henry Mannox. Mannox's exact age is unknown; although it has recently been stated that he was in his late thirties, perhaps 36, at the time, this is not supported by Catherine's biographers. Evidence exists that Mannox was not yet married, which would be highly unusual for someone from his background at the time to have reached mid-thirties without being married - he married sometime in the late 1530s, perhaps 1539, and there is also some evidence that he was of an age with two other men serving in the household, including his cousin Edward Waldegrave (who was in his late teens or early twenties from 1536-8). These pieces of evidence indicate that Mannox too was in his early to mid-twenties in 1538. This is, however, guess work, based on interpreting fragmentary surviving details about Mannox, since there are no baptismal records for him. Subsequently a relationship arose between Catherine and Mannox, the details and dates of which are debated between modern historians. The most popular theory, first put forward in 2004 by Retha M. Warnicke, was that the relationship between them was abusive, with Mannox grooming and preying on Catherine from 1536-8, and this is expanded upon in detail by Conor Byrne. Other biographers, like Gareth Russell, believe Mannox's interactions with Catherine took place over a much shorter period of time, that Mannox was of roughly the same age as her, but that \\"their relationship was nonetheless inappropriate, on several levels.\\" He believes Catherine was increasingly repulsed by Mannox's pressure to lose her virginity to him and was angered by his gossiping with servants about the details of what had gone on between them. Mannox and Catherine both confessed during her adultery inquisitions that they had engaged in sexual contact, but not actual coitus. When questioned Catherine was quoted as saying, \\"At the flattering and fair persuasions of Mannox, being but a young girl, I suffered him at sundry times to handle and touch the secret parts of my body, which neither became me with honesty to permit nor him to require.\\" Catherine severed contact with Mannox in 1538, most likely in the spring. It is not true, as is sometimes stated, that this was because she began to spend more time at the Dowager Duchess's mansion in Lambeth, as Lambeth was Mannox's home parish and where he married, perhaps in later 1538-9. He was still living in Lambeth in 1541. Shortly after, Catherine was pursued by Francis Dereham, a secretary of the Dowager Duchess. They allegedly became lovers, addressing each other as \\"husband\\" and \\"wife\\". Dereham also entrusted Catherine with various wifely duties, such as keeping his money when he was away on business. Many of Catherine's roommates among the Dowager Duchess's maids of honour and attendants knew of the relationship, which apparently ended in 1539, when the Dowager Duchess found out. Despite this, Catherine and Dereham may have parted with intentions to marry upon his return from Ireland, agreeing to a precontract of marriage. If indeed they exchanged vows before having sexual intercourse, they would have been considered married in the eyes of the Church. Arrival at court Catherine's uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, found her a place at Court in the household of the King's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. As a young and attractive lady-in-waiting, Catherine quickly caught Henry's eye. The King had displayed little interest in Anne from the beginning, but on Thomas Cromwell's failure to find a new match for Henry, Norfolk saw an opportunity. The Howards may have sought to recreate the influence gained during Anne Boleyn's reign as queen consort. According to Nicholas Sander, the religiously conservative Howard family may have seen Catherine as a figurehead for their fight by expressed determination to restore Roman Catholicism to England. Catholic Bishop Stephen Gardiner entertained the couple at Winchester Palace with \\"feastings\\". As the King's interest in Catherine grew, so did the house of Norfolk's influence. Her youth, prettiness and vivacity were captivating for the middle-aged sovereign, who claimed he had never known \\"the like to any woman\\". Within months of her arrival at court, Henry bestowed gifts of land and expensive cloth upon Catherine. Henry called her his 'very jewel of womanhood' (that he called her his 'rose without a thorn' is likely a myth). The French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, thought her \\"delightful\\". Holbein's portrait showed a young auburn-haired girl with a characteristically hooked Howard nose; Catherine was said to have a \\"gentle, earnest face.\\" Marriage Catherine Howard's arms as queen King Henry and Catherine were married by Bishop Bonner of London at Oatlands Palace on 28 July 1540, the same day Cromwell was executed. She was a teenager and he was 49. Catherine adopted the motto, Non autre volont√© que la sienne or \\"No other wish but his\\" using the English translation from French. The marriage was made public on 8 August, and prayers were said in the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace. Henry \\"indulged her every whim\\" thanks to her \\"caprice\\". Catherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox had taught her to play the virginals. She was too young to take part in administrative matters of State. Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day she dressed with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read Non autre volont√© que la sienne (No other will but his/hers), decorated in gold around her sleeves. The Queen escaped plague-ridden London in August 1540 when on progress. The royal couple's entourage travelled on honeymoon through Reading and Buckingham. After the Queen's Chamberlain got drunk and misbehaved, the King was in a bad mood when they moved on to Woking, when his health improved. The King embarked on a lavish spending spree to celebrate his marriage, with extensive refurbishments and developments at the Palace of Whitehall. This was followed by more expensive gifts for Christmas at Hampton Court Palace. That winter the King's bad moods deepened and grew more furious. Undoubtedly the pain from his ulcerous legs was agony, but did not make relations any easier at court. He accused councillors of being \\"lying time-servers\\", and began to regret losing Cromwell. After a dark depressed March, his mood lifted at Easter. Preparations were in place for any signs of a royal pregnancy, reported by Marillac on 15 April as \\"if it be found true, to have her crowned at Whitsuntide.\\" Downfall Catherine may have been involved during her marriage to the King with Henry's favourite male courtier, Thomas Culpeper, a young man who \\"had succeeded [him] in the Queen's affections\\", according to Dereham's later testimony. She had considered marrying Culpeper during her time as a maid-of-honour to Anne of Cleves. Culpeper called Catherine \\"my little, sweet fool\\" in a love letter. It has been alleged that in the spring of 1541 the pair were meeting secretly. Their meetings were allegedly arranged by one of Catherine's older ladies-in-waiting, Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford (Lady Rochford), the widow of Catherine's executed cousin, George Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's brother. During the autumn Northern Progress, a crisis over Catherine's conduct began to loom. People who claimed to have witnessed her earlier sexual behaviour while she was still a ward at Lambeth reportedly contacted her for favours in return for their silence, and some of these blackmailers may have been appointed to her royal household. John Lascelles, the brother of Mary Lascelles, claimed that he had tried to persuade his sister to find a place within the Queen's royal chamber. However Mary had allegedly refused, stating that she had witnessed the \\"light\\" ways of Queen Catherine while they were living together at Lambeth. Supposedly after hearing this John Lascelles reported such news to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, who then interrogated Lascelles's sister. Under the Archbishop's interrogation, Mary alleged that Catherine had had sexual relations while under the Duchess's care, before her relationship with the King. Cranmer immediately took up the case to be made to topple his rivals‚Äîthe Roman Catholic Norfolk family. Lady Rochford was interrogated and from fear of being tortured agreed to talk. She told how she had watched for Catherine backstairs as Culpeper had made his escapes from the Queen's room. Letter from Catherine Howard to Thomas Culpeper During the investigation a love letter written in the Queen's distinctive handwriting was found in Culpeper's chambers. This is the only letter of hers that survived (other than her later \\"confession\\"). On All Saints' Day, 1 November 1541, the King arranged to be found praying in the Chapel Royal. There he received a letter describing the allegations against Catherine. On 7 November 1541 Archbishop Cranmer led a delegation of councillors to Winchester Palace, Southwark, to question her. Even the staunch Cranmer found the teenage Catherine's frantic, incoherent state pitiable, saying, \\"I found her in such lamentation and heaviness as I never saw no creature, so that it would have pitied any man's heart to have looked upon her.\\" He ordered the guards to remove any objects that she might use to commit suicide. Imprisonment and death Establishing the existence of a precontract between Catherine and Dereham would have had the effect of terminating Catherine's royal union, but it would also have allowed Henry to annul their marriage and banish her from Court in poverty and disgrace instead of executing her, though there is no indication that Henry would have chosen that alternative. Yet Catherine steadfastly denied any precontract, maintaining that Dereham had raped her. Catherine was stripped of her title as queen on 23 November 1541 and imprisoned in the new Syon Abbey, Middlesex, formerly a convent, where she remained throughout the winter of 1541. She was forced by a Privy Councillor to return Anne of Cleves's ring that the King had given her; it was a symbol of her regal and lawful rights. The King would be at Hampton Court, but she would not see him again. Despite these actions taken against her, her marriage to Henry was never formally annulled. Culpeper and Dereham were arraigned at Guildhall on 1 December 1541 for high treason. They were executed at Tyburn on 10 December 1541, Culpeper being beheaded and Dereham being hanged, drawn and quartered. According to custom, their heads were placed on spikes atop London Bridge. Many of Catherine's relatives were also detained in the Tower with the exception of her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who had sufficiently distanced himself from the scandal by retreating to Kenninghall to write a grovelling letter of apology. The Duke of Norfolk's son Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, a poet, remained a favourite of the King. The Duke, knowing his family had fallen from grace, wrote an apology on 14 December to the King, excusing himself and laying all the blame on his niece and stepmother. All of the Howard prisoners were tried, found guilty of concealing treason and sentenced to life imprisonment and forfeiture of goods. In time they were released with their goods restored. The King sank further into morbidity and indulged his appetite for food and women. Catherine herself remained in limbo until Parliament introduced on 29 January 1542 a bill of attainder, which was passed on 7 February 1542. The Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541 made it treason, and punishable by death, for a queen consort to fail to disclose her sexual history to the king within twenty days of their marriage, or to incite someone to commit adultery with her. This measure retroactively solved the matter of Catherine's supposed precontract and made her unequivocally guilty. No formal trial was held. When the Lords of the Council came for her she allegedly panicked and screamed as they manhandled her into the barge that would escort her to the Tower on Friday 10 February 1542, her flotilla passing under London Bridge where the heads of Culpeper and Dereham were impaled (and remained until 1546). Entering through the Traitors' Gate she was led to her prison cell. The next day the bill of attainder received Royal Assent and Catherine's execution was scheduled for 7:00 am on Monday 13 February 1542. Arrangements for the execution were supervised by Sir John Gage in his role as Constable of the Tower. The night before her execution Catherine is believed to have spent many hours practising how to lay her head upon the block, which had been brought to her at her request. She died with relative composure but looked pale and terrified; she required assistance to climb the scaffold. She made a speech describing her punishment as \\"worthy and just\\" and asked for mercy for her family and prayers for her soul. According to popular folklore her last words were, \\"I die a Queen, but I would rather have died the wife of Culpeper\\". However no eyewitness accounts support this, instead reporting that she stuck to traditional final words, asking for forgiveness for her sins and acknowledging that she deserved to die \\"a thousand deaths\\" for betraying the king, who had always treated her so graciously. This was typical of the speeches given by those executed during that period, most likely in an effort to protect their families, since the condemned's last words would be relayed to the King. Catherine was beheaded with a single stroke of the executioner's axe. Lady Rochford was executed immediately thereafter on Tower Green. Both bodies were buried in an unmarked grave in the nearby chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, where the bodies of Catherine's cousins Anne and George Boleyn also lay. Other cousins were also in the crowd, including the Earl of Surrey. King Henry did not attend. Catherine's body was not one of those identified during restorations of the chapel during Queen Victoria's reign. She is commemorated on a plaque on the west wall dedicated to all those who died in the Tower. Upon hearing news of Catherine's execution Francis I of France wrote a letter to Henry regretting the \\"lewd and naughty [evil] behaviour of the Queen\\" and advising him that \\"the lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men\\". Historiography Catherine has been the subject of contention for modern biographies, A Tudor Tragedy by Lacey Baldwin Smith (1967), Katherine Howard: A Tudor Conspiracy by Joanna Denny (2006), Katherine Howard: Henry VIII's Slandered Queen by Conor Byrne (2019), and Young and Damned and Fair by Gareth Russell (2017). Each is more or less sympathetic, though they disagree on various important points involving Catherine's motivations, date of birth and overall character. Her life has also been described in the five collective studies of Henry's queens that have appeared since the publication of Alison Weir's The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1991) ‚Äî such as David Starkey's The Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII (2003). Several of these writers have been highly critical of Catherine's conduct, if sympathetic to her eventual fate. Baldwin Smith described Catherine's life as one of hedonism and characterised her as a \\"juvenile delinquent\\", as did Francis Hackett in his 1929 biography of Henry. Weir had much the same judgement, describing her as an \\"empty-headed wanton\\". The general trend, however, has been more generous, particularly in the works of Antonia Fraser, Karen Lindsey, David Loades, Joanna Denny, Conor Byrne, Josephine Wilkinson, and Gareth Russell. Portraits Portrait of a Lady, perhaps Katherine Howard, c. 1540 (Royal Collection) Portrait Miniature of Katherine Howard, c. 1540 (Buccleuch Collection) Painters continued to include Jane Seymour in pictures of King Henry VIII long after she died, mainly because Henry continued to look back on her with favour as the only wife who gave him a son. Most of the artists copied the portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger because it was the only full-sized picture available. After Catherine Howard was executed, even the Howard family removed her picture from their family portrait gallery. Debate continues about the identity of the sitter(s) for these portraits, and there is no portrait conclusively known to be of Henry's fifth queen. =Miniatures= Two portrait miniatures by Hans Holbein the Younger, one in the Royal Collection and another in the Buccleuch Collection, may be the only surviving depictions of Catherine painted from life (in the case of the Royal Collection version at Windsor). The historian David Starkey dated it (from details of her dress and the technique of the miniature) to the short period when Catherine was queen. In it, she wears a pendant jewel that is similar to that shown in Holbein's portrait of Jane Seymour at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and identical to that shown in the portrait of Henry VIII‚Äôs third queen, in the Mauritshuis, The Hague. Records show that these jewels belonged to the Crown, not to any queen personally, and there is no record that they were removed from the treasury and given to anyone else. The pearls may tie in with a gift to Catherine from Henry in 1540, and she is the only queen to fit the dating whose appearance is not already known. For female sitters, duplicate versions of miniatures only exist for queens at this period. There are no other plausible likenesses of her to compare to. Both versions have long been documented as of Catherine Howard, since 1736 for the Buccleuch version and 1739 (or at least the 1840s) for the Windsor version. =Other portraits= A Holbein drawing (below) is also traditionally identified as being of Catherine Howard, but this is widely disputed.

Two copies of Holbein's original are extant: one at Hever Castle and another owned by the National Portrait Gallery in London. \\"This portrait was previously identified as Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry VIII. The sitter is now thought to be a member of the Cromwell family, perhaps Elizabeth Seymour (c.1518‚Äì1568), sister of Henry VIII‚Äôs third wife, Jane Seymour, and wife of Thomas Cromwell‚Äôs son Gregory.\\" The portrait has long been associated with Henry VIII's young queen; however, the identification of the portrait as Catherine Howard is widely but not universally discounted. File:Holbein, Hans (II) - Portrait of a lady, probably of the Cromwell Family formerly known as Catherine Howard - WGA11565.jpgPortrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family c. 1535‚Äì1540 (Toledo Museum of Art) File:Unknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpgUnknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard, late 17th century, after Hans Holbein the Younger File:Unknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard, engraving.jpgUnknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard, 1902, after Hans Holbein the Younger The inscription on the portrait, ETATIS SV√Ü 21, indicates that the sitter was twenty-one years old, an age Catherine Howard never reached. Herbert Norris notes that the sitter is wearing a sleeve which follows a style set by Anne of Cleves, which would date the portrait to after 6 January 1540, when Anne's marriage to Henry VIII took place. Anne of Cleves was queen consort from 6 January ‚Äì 9 July 1540. Until 1752, the year commenced on Lady Day, 25 March. The original Holbein is dated to 1535‚Äì1540, but the National Portrait Gallery dates their copy to the late 1600s. This would seem to indicate a sitter who was still a connection to be commemorated over a century later (unlike Catherine). Historians Antonia Fraser and Derek Wilson believe that the portrait is far more likely to depict Elizabeth Seymour. Antonia Fraser has argued that the sitter is Jane Seymour's sister, Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, on the grounds that the lady bears a resemblance to Jane, especially around the nose and chin, and wears widow's black. Black clothing, however, was expensive, and did not necessarily signify mourning: it was an indication of wealth and status. Derek Wilson observed that \\"In August 1537 Cromwell succeeded in marrying his son, Gregory, to Elizabeth Seymour\\", the queen's younger sister. He was therefore related by marriage to the king, \\"an event worth recording for posterity, by a portrait of his daughter-in-law.\\" The painting was in the possession of the Cromwell family for centuries. The portrait shown on this page, attributed to Hans Holbein, dated circa 1535‚Äì1540, is exhibited at the Toledo Museum of Art as Portrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family (1926.57). Another version of the portrait, now located at Hever Castle, dating from the 16th century, is exhibited as Portrait of a Lady, thought to be Catherine Howard. The National Portrait Gallery exhibits a similar painting, Unknown Woman, Formerly Known as Catherine Howard (NPG 1119), which has been dated to the late 17th century.

The painting is attributed to the workshop of Hans Holbein. Portrayal in media =On stage= * In 1998 Emilia Fox played the title role in Katherine Howard at the Chichester Festival Theatre, in Chichester, Sussex; she would later play Henry's third wife Jane Seymour in the 2003 ITV drama Henry VIII. *Aimie Atkinson (later Vicki Manser and Sophie Issacs) portrays a highly sympathetic Howard in Six the Musical on the West End, emphasizing her playfulness and youth, as well as her history of abuse. Samantha Pauly would portray her in the Broadway run of the show at the Brooks Atkinson theater. =In film and television= * Catherine was first portrayed on screen in 1926, in the silent film Hampton Court Palace, when she was played by Gabrielle Morton. * In 1933, in The Private Life of Henry VIII, Catherine was played by Binnie Barnes. In this comedy of manners, Catherine ambitiously sets out to seduce the king, played by Charles Laughton, but ultimately falls in love with the debonair, devoted Thomas Culpeper, played by Robert Donat. Catherine's story dominates the film. * In 1970 Angela Pleasence played Catherine in a 90-minute BBC television drama, as part of the series The Six Wives of Henry VIII, opposite Keith Michell as Henry VIII, Patrick Troughton as the Duke of Norfolk and Sheila Burrell as Lady Rochford. In this interpretation, Catherine is characterised as a selfish hedonist who uses the na√Øve Culpeper to try to get herself pregnant to secure her position. * Catherine Howard made a cameo appearance, played by Monika Dietrich, in the 1971 slapstick British comedy Carry On Henry, with Sid James as Henry VIII. * In 1972 Lynne Frederick portrayed a deeply sympathetic Queen Catherine in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (a film version made subsequent to the 1970 BBC series) opposite Keith Michell as Henry VIII, in a production that highlighted her youth and positive qualities. * In 2001 Michelle Abrahams played Catherine in Dr. David Starkey's television documentary on Henry's queens. * In 2003 Emily Blunt gave a more sympathetic portrayal of Catherine in the ITV television drama Henry VIII, which focused on Catherine's sexual escapades. This production, once again, explained her adultery by her relatives' desire for her to get pregnant. It shows Catherine crying and screaming with fear at her execution, although contemporary accounts suggest she died in a more dignified manner. * In 2009 and 2010 Tamzin Merchant played Catherine Howard in the third and fourth seasons of the Showtime series The Tudors. Merchant portrays Catherine as being flighty yet sweet, sexually adventurous, fun-loving and unquestionably adulterous. She is willingly seduced into the affair with Culpeper (who nurses a lustful obsession with her) by Lady Rochford, whose motivations are somewhat murky. This interpretation also details Catherine's blackmail at the hands of her former friends from Lambeth, a detail often omitted from modern retellings due to its deficit of historical evidence. * Elena Valentine played Catherine in the 2016 Henry VIII and His Six Wives TV mini-series by Oxford Film & Television. * In 2015, an episode of Horrible Histories entitled \\"Horrid Henry VIII\\" featured Louise Ford portraying Catherine Howard. * Lauren McQueen portrayed Catherine in the 2016 documentary drama Six Wives with Lucy Worsley =In music= * Rick Wakeman recorded the piece \\"Catherine Howard\\" for his 1973 album The Six Wives of Henry VIII. On his 2009 live version of the album the spelling is changed to \\"Kathryn Howard\\". * Catherine's story is related in the song \\"Catherine Howard's Fate\\" by the band Blackmore's Night. * Catherine also appears in the musical Six, originated by Aimie Atkinson, in the West End, and on Broadway production is Samantha Pauly. She sings the song \\"All You Wanna Do\\", portraying her relationships outside of her marriage to King Henry VIII and including her affair with Thomas Culpeper and getting sexually abused as a child with Henry Mannox and Francis Dereham.

The palace was commissioned by King Friedrich Wilhelm II (Frederick William II of Prussia) and designed in the early Neoclassical style by the architects Carl von Gontard and Carl Gotthard Langhans. The palace remained in use by the Hohenzollern family until the early 20th century. It served as a military museum under communist rule, but has since been restored and is once again open to the public. Building history The Marmorpalais was designed by the architects Carl von Gontard and (from 1789) Carl Gotthard Langhans, the designer of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. The Marmorpalais was reserved as a summer residence for the private use of the king, who had an artistic temperament. With this new construction the nephew and successor of Frederick the Great dissociated himself from his childless uncle, whom he disliked and who favored earlier Baroque and Rococo forms. The red brick Marmorpalais was originally a two-story square building. A fine view of the surrounding gardens and lakes is possible from a round pavilion on the flat roof of the cubical structure. Among other buildings, the little castle on the Pfaueninsel in the Havel river was constructed as an eye-catcher. A stairway and gallery accessed from the roof lead into the belvedere. Sculptured putti carrying a basket of fruit decorate the tip of the pavilion. The palace got its name from the grey and white Silesian marble used for the decorative elements and partitioning structures. Boat moorings could be approached by members of the court via a large terrace on the lake side of the palace, from which a stairway led down to the water. The king enjoyed extensive boat rides; even Charlottenburg Palace on the Spree river in Berlin could be reached by boat from here. On the nearby lake shore is to be found the palace kitchen, which was built 1788-1790 by Langhans in the romantic style of a half-sunken classical temple ruin. An underground corridor provides a connection with an artificial grotto on the ground floor of the palace which served as a dining room in summertime. The Marmorpalais is closely associated with Wilhelmine Enke (also spelled Encke), known popularly as \\"Beautiful Wilhelmine\\". As Frederick William II's mistress she had a great influence on the interior decoration of the palace; in 1796 she was made Countess Lichtenau. After only a few years of use the palace was considered to be too small, and in 1797 construction started on two side wings designed by Michael Philipp Boumann. The architect connected these single-story, rectangular extensions to the right and left of the main entrance on the garden side of the palace with galleries in the form of quarter circles. The marble required to decorate these extensions was obtained by removing Frederick William's colonnades from Park Sanssouci and incorporating the pillars in the new building. This garden architecture designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff had originally stood on the main boulevard connecting Sanssouci Palace and the New Palace. Historical map of the Potsdam surroundings, 1773. Heiliger See is the small lake in the NE quadrant When the king died in November 1797, just the shell of the extensions had been completed. His son and successor, Frederick William III of Prussia, being uninterested in the project, only had the exterior finished. This was still the situation in the 1830s when Prince Wilhelm (William), later Kaiser William I, and his spouse Augusta moved into the Marmorpalais while they awaited the completion of their new residence at Babelsberg Palace (1833-1835-1849). His brother, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, known as \\"a royal nostalgic romanticist\\", commissioned the architect Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse to complete the unfinished interior structure and fittings for the two side extensions between 1843 and 1848. Frescos with scenes from the Nibelungenlied were added to the outside to decorate the colonnade walls. The building's technical and sanitary facilities were updated when Prince Wilhelm (William), later Kaiser Wilhelm II, and his family lived in the Marmorpalais from 1881 until he acceded to the throne in 1888. The last royal inhabitants of the Marmorpalais were Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and his spouse Cecilie, who lived there for most of the year between 1904 and 1917, when they moved to nearby Cecilienhof Palace, built for them in the Neuer Garten. After the German monarchy came to an end in 1918, the Marmorpalais was placed under the control of the Prussian palaces administration in 1926 as a result of a settlement between the Free State of Prussia and the Hohenzollern family regarding property claims. It opened as a palace museum in 1932, with restored interior furnishings from the 18th and 19th centuries. Toward the end of World War II the palace suffered serious damage when the north wing was hit by an incendiary bomb, and the main building by a grenade. Its condition further deteriorated after the war, over a period of time when the Soviet Red Army used it as a venue for an officers' mess, beginning in 1946. In 1961, the East German GDR Army Museum was established in the building. Inside, historic military equipment, uniforms and historic documents were on display and on the outside, cannon, a T-34 tank, a high-speed patrol boat, a MiG fighter airplane and a rocket were exhibited. The weapons were removed in 1989. Starting in 1984, the National People's Army made plans for a fundamental restoration as the building continued to fall into disrepair. These plans came to fruition in 1988 and the work continued in late autumn 1990 after the return of the property to the palaces administration. Since 14 April 2006 all 40 rooms have been renovated and opened to the public. Repair of the exterior surface was completed in autumn 2009 after several years of restoration work. The interior rooms Beginning in 1790, Carl Gotthard Langhans was commissioned with designing the interior rooms. Marble fireplaces and antique sculpture were a prominent feature in decisions about the decorative furnishings; these had been purchased in Italy for the Marmorpalais by the architect Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff. This Saxon nobleman, who was already famous for planning and executing early Neoclassical buildings in Dessau-W√∂rlitz, had been invited to work in Berlin in 1787. On the ground floor of the main building there is a vestibule leading to a stairway extending the entire height of the building. Behind it is a large room designed as a grotto and used in the summertime as a dining room. This room is situated on the eastern side of the palace and faces the lake. Because of its shady location and the calm, cool effect of its greyish blue marble paneling its occupants enjoyed a pleasant room climate. On either side of this middle axis there were six private rooms serving as royal living quarters. Upstairs, the rooms are grouped around the central marble stairway. The largest room, the concert hall, extended across the entire lake side of the palace. It was later used as a salon during the reign of the German Kaisers. The furnishings and decorative architecture of the rooms reflected a taste for the Neoclassical style, the only exception being the so-called Oriental cabinet on the upper floor, which Langhans designed as a Turkish tent with a divan. World Heritage Site Since 1990, the Marmorpalais has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\\". The palace is administered by the Stiftung Preu√üische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin-Brandenburg.

In 1899, Reach sold his interest to Rogers due to repeated disagreements about the direction of the club. Reach and Rogers sold the Phillies to a group led by James Potter in February 1903, but retained the rights to the team's stadium, National League Park (which eventually became Baker Bowl). On August 8, a balcony collapsed at the park, killing 12 people and injuring hundreds more. Rogers was nearly ruined by the resulting avalanche of lawsuits, and was forced to sell the stadium to Potter as well. Eventually, both Rogers and Reach were absolved of blame and financial responsibility for the accident by the U.S. Supreme Court. Rogers died of heart failure in Denver, Colorado on March 13, 1910.

It sought to resolve trade issues between the two countries and agree boundaries between Spanish Florida and the English colony of Georgia. The Convention established a Boundary Commission to set borders between Georgia and Florida, while Spain provided compensation of ¬£95,000 for confiscated British property. In return, the British South Sea Company would pay ¬£68,000 to settle Spanish claims for profits due on the Asiento de Negros. Despite being owned by the British government, it refused to do so; both countries rejected the Convention, leading to the outbreak of the War of Jenkins Ear on 23 October 1739. Background Robert Walpole, British Prime Minister In the 18th century, wars were often fought over commercial issues, due to the then dominant economic theory of mercantilism. This viewed trade as a finite resource, so if one country increased its share, it must be at the expense of others. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ending the War of the Spanish Succession included commercial provisions allowing Britain to trade directly with New Spain. They included the Asiento de Negros, a monopoly to supply 5,000 slaves a year to its colonies in the Americas and the Navio de Permiso, permitting British ships to sell 1,000 tons of goods in Porto Bello and Veracruz. However, these turned out to be relatively unprofitable and have been described as a 'commercial illusion'; between 1717 to 1733, the British sent only eight ships to the Americas. Georgia in 1733 raised tensions by threatening Spanish possessions in the Caribbean Basin. The real profits came from smuggled goods that evaded customs duties, with demand from Spanish colonists creating a large black market. Accepting it could not be stopped, the Spanish authorities used it as an informal instrument of policy. During the 1727 to 1729 Anglo-Spanish War, French ships carrying contraband were let through, while British ships were stopped. The British accepted the occasional confiscation of ships and goods as part of the cost of business but were concerned by the prospect of being replaced by the French. These were heightened by the 1733 Pacte de Famille between Louis XV and his uncle Philip V, indicating greater alignment between France and Spain. The 1729 Treaty of Seville allowed the Spanish to board British vessels trading with New Spain; in 1731, Robert Jenkins, captain of the Rebecca, claimed a coast guard officer severed his ear. The legend this was later exhibited to the House of Commons has no basis in fact and the incident forgotten with the easing of restrictions in 1732. The establishment of the British colony of Georgia in early 1733 increased tension, since it appeared to threaten Spanish Florida, vital for protecting trade between mainland Spain and its colonies. A second round of 'depredations' in 1738 led to demands for compensation, British newsletters and pamphlets presenting them as inspired by France. This placed political pressure on Robert Walpole, the long-serving British Prime Minister, to reach a satisfactory deal. Negotiations Benjamin Keene, British Ambassador to Spain and chief negotiator Delegates from both sides met at the El Pardo palace in Madrid from late 1738. By January 1739, they had drawn up a basic agreement. The British had initially demanded ¬£200,000 in compensation but ultimately accepted just ¬£95,000. Spain originally demanded unlimited rights to search vessels, but this was eventually restricted to those in Spanish waters. In return, the British South Sea Company would pay Philip V of Spain ¬£68,000 to settle his share of proceeds from the Asiento de Negros and a Boundary Commission established to settle borders between Georgia and Florida. The chief British negotiator Sir Benjamin Keene felt this was a good deal and signed on January 14. Aftermath The Convention was extremely unpopular in London. Many merchant captains were unhappy that the British compensation claim had been more than halved, the South Sea Company being concerned by the agreement allowing the Spanish limited rights to search British ships. Within months, the situation had turned sharply towards war, and the Convention grew increasingly fragile. Opponents published a list of all those who voted in favour of the Convention, including details of their income from government positions. When the South Sea Company refused to pay the agreed ¬£68,000, Philip V rescinded the asiento de Negros. On 20 July 1739, the Admiralty sent a naval force under Admiral Vernon to the West Indies, reaching Antigua in early October. Three British ships attacked La Guaira, principal port of the Province of Venezuela on 22 October; Britain formally declared war the next day, beginning the War of Jenkins' Ear. Sir Benjamin Keene was closely associated with Walpole and after his fall, there was some discussion of impeaching him for negotiating the Convention. The war later become submerged into the wider War of the Austrian Succession. The issues that had started the war were largely ignored during the Congress of Breda and the Treaty of Aix- la-Chapelle that ended it in 1748, as they were no longer priorities for the two sides. Some issues were eventually resolved in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, but illegal British trade with the Spanish colonies continued to flourish. The Spanish Empire in the Caribbean remained intact and victorious despite several English attempts to seize some of its heavily defended and fortified colonies. Spain would later use its trading routes and resources to help the rebels' cause in the American Revolution. The issue resurfaced in the dispute between the United States and Spain known as the West Florida Controversy; it was initially resolved by Pinckney's Treaty in 1796, then settled when Spanish Florida was relinquished in the 1819 Adams-Onis Treaty.

A Dolly Varden, in this sense, is a woman's outfit fashionable from about 1869 to 1875 in Britain and the United States. It is named after a character in Charles Dickens, and the items of clothing referred to are usually a hat or dress. Name Dolly Varden is a character from Charles Dickens's 1839 historical novel Barnaby Rudge set in 1780. The Dolly Varden costume was an 1870s version of fashions of the 1770s and 1780s. Fashion The term \\"Dolly Varden\\" in dress is generally understood to mean a brightly patterned, usually flowered, dress with a polonaise overskirt gathered up and draped over a separate underskirt. The overdress is typically made from printed cotton or chintz, although it can be made from other materials such as lightweight wool, silk and muslin. An 1869 fashion doll in the collection of the V&A; Museum of Childhood is dressed in the Dolly Varden mode; unusually the outfit is in dark colours.1869 Fashion doll wearing Dolly Varden costume in the collection of the V&A; Museum of Childhood.

Accessed 6 February 2010 A Dolly Varden hat, as it relates to the dress, is usually understood to mean a flat straw hat trimmed with flowers and ribbons, very like the 18th-century berg√®re hat. It is also closely related to the Pamela hat or \\"gipsy hat\\" that was popular during the earlier part of the century. Although the typical Dolly Varden fashion of the large overskirt and polonaise died out with changes in fashion at the turn of the century, the names continued to be associated with chintz patterned fabrics and peplum style dresses. Even in the late 1930s, chintz patterned fashions might still have the name 'Dolly Varden' attached to them. Popular culture The Dolly Varden fashion fad inspired many popular songs, such as G.W. Moore's \\"Dressed in a Dolly Varden\\" and Alfred Lee's novelty song, \\"Dolly Varden\\", (published Cleveland, 1872) which contains the lyrics: Have you seen my little girl? She doesn‚Äôt wear a bonnet. She‚Äôs got a monstrous flip-flop hat with cherry ribbons on it. She dresses in bed furniture just like a flower garden A blowin‚Äô and a growin‚Äô and they call it Dolly Varden. In the 1870s, the Theatre Royal in London presented an entertainment called The Dolly Varden Polka, composed by W.C. Levey.Levey, W. C. The Dolly Varden (polka music) composed by W.C. Levey Accessed 6 February 2010 The fashion led to the naming of the Dolly Varden trout. In the second book of the novel Alexandria Quartet by Lawrence Durrell, Scobie, a gay Binbashi, tells the protagonist Darley that when he cross-dresses he wears a Dolly Varden hat. One of the most famous uses of the name in theatre was the Dolly Varden comic opera which opened in 1902 starring Lulu Glaser. Although the main character fit the image of the Dickens character, the play itself was based on The Country Wife by William Wycherley. Another interesting occurrence of the name is in the eponymous decorative cake, a recipe for which features in the 1980 Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake Book. Also known as a 'Princess Cake', the modern Dolly Varden cake uses the torso of a doll (sometimes called a doll pick) inserted into a conical cake which is then decorated as the doll's dress. 'Dolly Varden' aluminium cake tins are now broadly available from cookware retailers for this purpose. The name for the cake no doubt developed from the Dolly Varden dress. However, in the late 19th century, the Dolly Varden cake was different. Many recipes call for a double layered cake with one layer as a lemon or vanilla cake and the other as a rich spice or fruit cake. Chunks of cherries in the cake were often used to mimic the chintz of the fashion. Cedro, Carmel.

The diocese was incorporated according to the laws of the state of Wyoming. The parishes of the diocese were likewise incorporated with the bishop, the pastor and two lay trustees serving as a corporate board at each parish. He was successful in his appeals to the newly formed Catholic Church Extension Society for funds to expand the church across the state. He also directed the building of Cheyenne's St. Mary's Cathedral and a new episcopal residence. The cathedral was dedicated in 1909. He served the diocese as its bishop for nine years. Archbishop of Dubuque Following the retirement of Archbishop John Keane, Pope Pius X named Bishop Keane the fifth bishop and third archbishop of Dubuque on August 11, 1911. Even though he succeeded a man who shared his last name, they were not related, the two men had very different personalities. John Keane was well liked in the community, and nicknamed \\"Sugar\\" for his kind and generous nature. James Keane however, would come to be nicknamed \\"Hickory\\" due to his stern nature. On the same day that Keane was named Archbishop of Dubuque, the Diocese of Des Moines was established from the western half of the Diocese of Davenport. To compensate it for the loss of territory, Clinton County was given to the Davenport Diocese from the archdiocese. At this time the present boundaries of the archdiocese were established. One of Keane's interests as archbishop was Columbia (now Loras) College. When he came to Dubuque, Columbia had an enrollment of 330 and a staff of 20. By the time he died it had an enrollment of 700 and a faculty of 48. He began an endowment fund for the college in 1917, and it became one of only seven Catholic educational institutions in the U.S. with an endowment fund of at least one million dollars .http://www.encyclopediadubuque.org/index.php?title=KEANE%2C_James_J. He also started the diocesan newspaper, the Witness. Two movements were of interest to Keane during his time as archbishop. He was known as a staunch supporter of the temperance movement, and Keane took every opportunity to speak out against alcohol consumption. He was also a member of the Irish Peace Commission of 1920, which was focused on the conflict between England and Ireland. He gained national notoriety as one of the speakers at the 1926 World's Alliance for International Friendship. Keane led the archdiocese for 18 years until his death on August 2, 1929. Like his predecessor, James Keane was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Key West, Iowa.

Despite featuring Bram Stoker's name in the title, the film is not directly based on any of his writings or a mockbuster to the 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula, but shares similarities to films such as Blade: Trinity, Dracula 2000, Underworld: Evolution and Van Helsing. The film also shares some similarities with the 1971 Hammer horror film Countess Dracula, which also features a Dracula-esque femme fatale in the lead role.  Plot  The film takes place in an unidentified city (presumably New York City) in the modern day, and follows the characters of Rufus King (Thomas Downey) and Jacob Van Helsing (Rhett Giles), both of whom have been observing recent attacks made upon young teenagers in the city at night. Van Helsing correctly identifies that the attacks are being made by a group of vampires residing in the city. The vampires are led by a foreign seductress named Countess Bathorly (Christina Rosenberg), who hopes to use the humans to feed her growing vampire clan and to eventually seize control of the city, while at the same time using her growing power to gain the powers of \\"the Master\\". Discovering Bathorly's plan, Van Helsing and King begin to hunt down and destroy the vampires one by one, until they finally face the Countess herself and try to kill her once and for all, before her evil consumes the city and allows Dracula's curse to consume the human race. Reception Critical reaction to Dracula's Curse has been mixed to positive. Scott Foy of Dread Central wrote, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse isn't a bad movie. If you're looking for a vampire film cut from the same cloth as Vampire: The Masquerade or the short-lived TV series Kindred: The Embraced then you'll probably dig Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse, but you'll need to have a little patience.\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse (2006) Dread Central Patrick Luce of Monsters and Critics said, \\"Although at times some of the acting is a bit stiff and the special effects are a bit lacking, Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse ... is still packed full of enough gun fights, sword fights and vampire action to deliver a 'popcorn' rollercoaster ride of a fun movie.\\"DVD Review: Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse - Monsters and Critics Trash City's review stated, \\"Though falling some way short of perfection, if you liked Hellsing (the anime) or Ultraviolet (the Brit-TV show), then this will probably still be of interest, and is entertaining as such. But if your tastes run more to the fast 'n' furious style of vampire cinema which Hollywood currently prefers, then it's likely less recommended.\\"Trash City review: Bram Stoker's Dracula's Curse Horror DNA's review said, \\"[It's] the best movie The Asylum has to offer. ...

Opsi is developed and maintained by uib GmbH from Mainz, Germany. The main parts of Opsi are open-source licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License..  Features  The key features. of opsi are: * Automated operating system installation (OS deployment) * Software distribution * Patch management * Inventory (hardware and software) * License Management / Software Asset Management * Support of multiple locations A tool for automated installations is important and necessary for standardization, maintainability and cost saving of larger PC networks. Opsi supports the client operating systems MS Windows XP, Server 2003, Windows Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, Server 2008R2, Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Server 2012 R12 and Windows 10. The 32- and the 64-bit versions are supported. For the installation of an opsi-server there are packages available for the Linux distributions Debian, Ubuntu, SLES, Univention Corporate Server, CentOS, RHEL and OpenSuse.  Automated operating system installation  Via management interface a client may be selected for OS-Installation. If the client boots via PXE it loads a boot image from the opsi-depotserver. This bootimage prepares the hard disk, copies the required installation files, drivers and the opsi client agent and starts finally an unattended OS-Installation. Opsi uses the automatic detection of the necessary drivers for PCI-, HD-Audio- and USB-Devices. OS-installation via Disk image is also supported.  Software distribution  For the automatic software distribution some software, the opsi-client-agent, has to be installed on each client. Every time the client boots the opsi-client-agent connects to the opsi-server and asks if there is anything to install (default). If this shall be done a script driven installation program (opsi-winst) starts and installs the required software on the client. During the installation process the user login can be blocked for integrity reasons. To integrate a new software packet into the software deployment system, a script must be written to specify the installation process. This script provides all the information on how this software packet has to be installed silent or unattended or by using tools like AutoIt or Autohotkey. With the opsi-winst steps like copy files or edit the registry can be done. The opsi-client-agent can also be triggered by other events or via push-installation from the opsi-server.  Patch-Management  The mechanism of the software deployment can also be used to deploy software patches and hotfixes.  Inventory (hardware and software)  The hardware and software inventory also uses the opsi-client-agent. The hardware information is collected via calls to WMI while the software information is gathered from the registry. The inventory data are sent back to the opsi-server by a web service. The inventory data may imported via a web service to a CMDB e.g. in OTRS..  License management / Software Asset Management  The opsi License Management module supports the administration of different kinds of licenses like Retail, OEM and Volume licenses. It counts the licenses that are used with the software deployment. Using the combination of the License Management and the software inventory, Software Asset Management reports on the number of free and installed licenses can be generated. The License Management module is part of a Co-funding Project and not released as open source yet.  Support of multiple locations  The software to be installed can be deposited bandwidth saving on several depot server. The configuration data can be stored and edited on one single server.  opsi-server  The opsi-server provides the following services: * The configuration-server stores the configuration data of the clients and provides the methods to manage these data via a web service or the command-line. The data can be stored in files, in OpenLDAP or in a MySQL Database. * The depot-server stores software packages that may be installed on the clients. To provide support for multiple locations, multiple depot-servers may be controlled by one configuration-server. * A TFTP-Server provides the boot images for the OS-Installations. * A DHCP-Server may be integrated in the opsi-server.  Management interface  For managing opsi a graphical user interface. is available as an application or as a browser Applet. Management is also possible with a command line tool or via web service..  License  The opsi core features are open-source according to the GNU General Public License Version 3 and are free of charge. The core features are software distribution (or software deployment), OS deployment and hard- and software-inventory. These free components can be supplemented with closed source add-ons that require the payment of a fee. They are called Co- funding Projects.  Co-funding projects  Even though opsi is open source, there are some components which are not for free at the moment. These components are developed in a co-funding project. This means, that these parts are only available for those customers who paid a contribution to the cost of development. As soon as the development of a co-funding project is refinanced, the component will be part of the free opsi-version and can be used free of charge. It will be open source (as long as not prevented caused by technical reasons). The first of these co-funding Projects was the opsi support for Windows Vista/Windows 7. It was completed on 1 February 2008 and is free of charge since 1 March 2010. The source code was divided from the not yet paid parts and is open source since 30 November 2010. At the moment (January 2011) there are three co-funding projects: Treeview builds hierarchical groups of clients to manage; MySQL as backend for all data; and the license management module. The main focus of co-funding projects is to create software once for a pool of purchasers who share the cost and make it open source as soon as it paid in full...

(also known as Helene A. von Damm, n√©e Helene Antonia Winter; born May 4, 1938) is a former United States diplomat and Ambassador to Austria who also worked as an assistant to President Ronald Reagan. Early life Helene Antonia von Damm, born Helene Antonia Winter in LinzHelene (A.) von Damm, born Helene Winter May 4, 1938 in Linz:   (Austria) in 1938, grew up in Ulmerfeld-Hausmening (now part of Amstetten, Austria), where here father worked as engineer (German title: Betriebsingenieur) at the Neusiedler Papierfabrik (that was since 1918 part of the Neusiedler AG, now Mondi). She had a tumultuous childhood, marked by the Second World War, the Soviet occupation, and the death of her father from tuberculosis when she was twelve years old. She recalled that she \\"had a difficult time digesting\\" the things she witnessed as a child, and dreamed of \\"a better life in places far away.\\" In 1958 von Damm married a U.S. Army corporal named Charles McDonald and emigrated to the United States. In 1959 the couple settled in Detroit, where she found work as a typist and immersed herself in politics. Career Following her 1964 split from McDonald, von Damm moved to Chicago and worked as a secretary for the American Medical Political Action Committee. It was in that role that she first met Ronald Reagan during a speech in 1965. Von Damm was deeply critical of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, and was attracted to Reagan's political vision. ‚Ä≥Reagan was one of the few people who spoke totally differently ... He made a lot of sense to someone who had just come from socialism. Johnson wanted to change things back to what I'd left. I resolved that if Reagan ever ran for office, I'd try to get on his team‚Ä≥, she said. She moved to California in 1966 to work for Reagan's gubernatorial campaign. She started as a scheduling assistant, and in 1969 was appointed as his personal secretary. She continued working with Reagan through his two terms as governor. She then served as his executive assistant during his business years, and as a finance director for nine northeastern states during the 1980 Presidential campaign. After Reagan was elected president, von Damm was named Director for Presidential Personnel, and held that position for two years until 1983. Von Damm was appointed US Ambassador to Austria in 1983. She served for just over two years before resigning in 1986. Personal life Von Damm divorced her first husband in 1964, after growing restless with what she described as her former husband's lack of ambition. In 1971 she was remarried to Christian von Damm, a Bank of America executive of German descent. The marriage did not last, as von Damm notes that she had difficulty reconciling her demanding career with domestic life. She married her third husband Byron Leeds in 1981. Leeds, a Morris County, New Jersey computer industry consultant, had been an old friend. However, he remained in New Jersey while she was working in Washington. Following her diplomatic appointment to Austria the couple grew further apart, and they divorced soon after. While in Austria she married her fourth husband, Peter G√ºrtler, owner of Vienna's luxurious Sacher Hotel (himself very recently divorced). The relationship became a subject of public fascination, and eventually von Damm decided to signal her intention to resign. In June 1985 she cabled a resignation letter to Washington, indicating that it was ‚Ä≥the interests of our country‚Ä≥ that she step down. She left her post in 1986, and divorced Guertler the next year. He committed suicide in 1990. Since the year 2000 up until his death on May 27, 2016, she lived in her Vienna flat with the German actor J√ºrgen Wilke (de:J√ºrgen Wilke).

The system enables the user to view a number of parameters in real time, including current vehicle location, vehicle fuel consumption, driver times, vehicle emissions, and service intervals. The service was introduced in 1994. How it works Dynafleet is a web-based package that communicates with mobile tracking hardware installed on delivery vehicles. GPS devices and associated hardware communicate detailed data to the Dynafleet main database, which can be accessed via internet from any PC. A communication screen in the vehicle allows for two-way communication between the driver and the home office. In addition to fuel consumption, the hardware is capable of logging how many times the vehicle stops, its load during each stage of its trip, and its AdBlue consumption. Packages Dynafleet offers several different packages, depending on the client's needs. The three services provided by the system include: *Fuel & Environment: provides access to a number of reports, including fuel consumption, environmental reports, and vehicle service intervals. *Driver Times: offers remote tachograph download, activityreports etc. *Positioning: provides detailed maps, showing the location of individual delivery vehicles. *Messaging: provides the capacity to send text messages between drivers and their home office. Increased efficiency Dynafleet gives everyone in the transport chain important information. This in turn increases understanding of the entire operation, and costly mistakes can be avoided. The assignments are carried out more efficiently and planning is easier. The driver receives rapid and accurate information in clear text. The driver's environment is safer and there are fewer misunderstandings. With Dynafleet, the driver can take decisions that promote more economical driving. The traffic planner can take decisions that utilise the entire vehicle fleet and minimise empty runs. This allows companies to handle more orders with existing personnel and the existing vehicle fleet. The fleet manager can plan service intervals so that the vehicle fleet's active time is maximised. The information stored in the system allows managers to follow up everything from individual vehicles to the entire fleet. Dynafleet also gives the company an objective basis for subsequently rewarding those who do things correctly. At the office, administrative work is made easier. Dynafleet is easily integrated with existing office systems via a software option (API). This simplifies administration since Dynafleet's information is accessed from an office's regular administration program. Mobile applications Volvo also introduced a mobile application for their Dynafleet service, available on iPhone, iPad and android. New features include fuel efficiency score. This works by tracking fuel consumption for every vehicle and driver in any given fleet. Using this, the Dynafleet app calculates fuel efficiency scores for four key areas: anticipating and braking, engine and gear utilization, speed adaptation, and standstill. Each score can then be broken down into specific parameters for more detailed information.http://www.volvotrucks.com/trucks/global/en- gb/newsmedia/pressreleases/Pages/pressreleases.aspx?pubId=12995 References External links *Dynafleet web site *Dynafleet Virtual tour Volvo Trucks ","title":"Dynafleet"},{"id":"21193825","text":"Yaw Frimpong (born 4 December 1986 in Accra) is a Ghanaian professional footballer.

The square contains the Monument to the People's Heroes, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China in the square on October 1, 1949; the anniversary of this event is still observed there.The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed Tiananmen Square is within the top ten largest city squares in the world (440,500 m2 ‚Äì 880√ó500 m or 109 acres ‚Äì 960√ó550 yd). It has great cultural significance as it was the site of several important events in Chinese history. Outside China, the square is best known for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests that ended with a military crackdown, which is also known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or June Fourth Massacre.Wong, Jan (1997) Red China Blues, Random House, p. 278, . History Mao Zedong Mausoleum. The \\"corridor of a thousand steps\\" is visible behind the Gate of China, and Tiananmen Gate is in the distance. The Tiananmen (\\"Gate of Heavenly Peace\\"), a gate in the wall of the Imperial City, was built in 1415 during the Ming dynasty. In the 17th century, fighting between Li Zicheng's rebel forces and the forces of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty caused heavy damage to, or even destroyed, the gate. Tiananmen Square was designed and built in 1651, and was enlarged fourfold in the 1950s.Safra, J. (Ed.). (2003). Tiananmen Square. In New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The (15th ed., Chicago: Vol. 11). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica INC. p. 752. Britannica Online version Tthe gate historically known as the \\"Great Ming Gate\\", the southern gate to the Imperial City stands near the center of the square. It was renamed the \\"Great Qing Gate\\" during the Qing dynasty, and the \\"Gate of China\\" during the Republican era. Unlike the other gates in Beijing, such as the Tiananmen and the Zhengyang Gate, this was a purely ceremonial gateway, with three arches but no ramparts, similar in style to the ceremonial gateways found in the Ming tombs. This gate had a special status as the \\"Gate of the Nation\\", as can be seen from its successive names. It normally remained closed, except when the Emperor passed through. Commoner traffic was diverted to side gates at the western and eastern ends of the square, respectively. Because of this diversion in traffic, a busy marketplace, called \\"Chess Grid Streets\\", was developed in the big, fenced square to the south of this gate. Iconic image of the Tiananmen Square from the May Fourth movement of 1919 In 1860, during the Second Opium War, when British and French troops invaded Beijing, they pitched camp near the gate and briefly considered burning down the gate and the entire Forbidden City. They decided ultimately to spare the Forbidden City and instead burn down the Old Summer Palace. The Xianfeng Emperor eventually agreed to let the foreign powers barrack troops ‚Äì and later establish diplomatic missions ‚Äì in the area, hence there was the Legation Quarter immediately to the east of the square. When the forces of the Eight- Nation Alliance besieged Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, they badly damaged the office complexes and burnt down several ministries. After the Boxer Rebellion ended, the area became a space for the foreign powers to assemble their military forces. (video) Two shots of the namesake gate to the north followed by a shot of inside Tiananmen Square, 2017. In 1954, the Gate of China was demolished, allowing for the enlargement of the square. In November 1958, a major expansion of Tiananmen Square started, which was completed after only 11 months, in August 1959. This followed the vision of Mao Zedong to make the square the largest and most spectacular in the world, and intended to hold over 500,000 people. In that process, a large number of residential buildings and other structures have been demolished.Li, M. Lilliam; Dray-Novey, Alison J.; Kong, Haili (2007) Beijing: From Imperial Capital to Olympic City, Palgrave, On its southern edge, the Monument to the People's Heroes has been erected. Concomitantly, as part of the Ten Great Buildings constructed between 1958 and 1959 to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary History Museum (now the National Museum of China) were erected on the western and eastern sides of the square. For the first decade of the PRC, each National Day (October 1) was marked by a large military parade in Tiananmen Square, in conscious emulation of the annual Soviet celebrations of the Bolshevik Revolution. After the disaster of the Great Leap Forward, the CCP decided to cut costs and have only smaller annual National Day celebrations in addition to a large celebration with a military parade every 10 years. However, the chaos of the Cultural Revolution almost prevented such an event from taking place on National Day, 1969, which did take place (parades were also held there in 1966 and 1970). Ten years later, in 1979, the CCP again decided against a large scale celebration, coming at a time when Deng Xiaoping was still consolidating power and China had suffered a rebuff in a border war with Vietnam early in the year. By 1984, with the situation much improved and stabilized, the PRC held a military parade for the first time since 1959. The aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre prevented any such activities in October 1989, but military parades have been held in 1999 and 2009, on the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the PRC's founding. On May 8, 2015, a military parade was also held to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. In 1971, large portraits of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, and Mao Zedong were erected in the square, painted by artist Ge Xiaoguang, who is also responsible for producing the famous portrait of Mao that hangs over the Gate of Heavenly Peace. In 1980, with the downgrading of political ideology following Mao's death, the portraits were taken down and thenceforth only brought out on Labor Day (May 1) and National Day. In 1988, the CCP leadership decided to display only the portraits of Sun and Mao on national holidays. One year after Mao's death, a mausoleum was built near the site of the former Gate of China along the main north‚Äìsouth axis of the square. In connection with this project, the square was further increased in size to become fully rectangular and being able to accommodate 600,000 people. The urban context of the square was altered in the 1990s with both the construction of National Grand Theater in its vicinity and the expansion of the National Museum.

Along the west side of the square is the Great Hall of the People. Along the east side is the National Museum of China (dedicated to Chinese history predating 1919). Erected in 1989, Liberty, a statue representing the western icon holds her torch over the square. Chang'an Avenue, which is used for parades, lies between the Tian'anmen and the square.Trees line the east and west edges of the Square, but the square itself is open, with neither trees nor benches. The square is lit with large lamp posts which are fitted with video cameras. It is heavily monitored by uniformed and plain-clothes police officers. Events Tiananmen Square has been the site of a number of political events and student protests. Perhaps the most notable events that have occurred here were protests during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the proclamation of the People's Republic of China by Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, the Tiananmen Square protests in 1976 after the death of Zhou Enlai, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 after the death of Hu Yaobang. The latter resulted in military suppression and the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilian protestors. One of the most famous images that appears during these protests was when a man stood in front of a line of moving tanks and refused to move, which was captured on Chang'an Avenue near the square. Security cameras at Tiananmen Square Other notable events included annual mass military displays on each anniversary of the 1949 proclamation until October 1, 1959; the 1984 military parade for the 35th anniversary of the People's Republic of China which coincided with the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping; military displays and parades on the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in 1999; the Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident in 2001; military displays and parades on the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in 2009, and an incident in 2013 involving a vehicle that plowed into pedestrians. Access The square, located in the city center, is readily accessible by public transport. Line 1 of the Beijing Subway has stops at Tiananmen West and Tiananmen East, respectively, to the northwest and northeast of the square on Chang'an Avenue. Line 2's Qianmen Station is directly south of the square. City bus routes 1, 5, 10, 22, 52, 59, 82, 90, 99, 120, 126, 203, 205, 210 and 728 stop north of the Square. Buses 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 20, 22, 44, 48, 53, 54, 59, 66, 67, 72, 82, 110, 120, 126, 301, 337, 608, 673, 726, 729, 901, 90, Áâπ2, Áâπ4 and Áâπ7 stop to the south of the Square. The square is normally open to the public, but remains under heavy security. Before entry, visitors and their belongings are searched, a common practice at many Chinese tourist sites, although the square is somewhat unusual in that domestic visitors often have their identification documents checked and the purpose of their visit questioned. Both plain-clothes and uniformed police officers patrol the area. There are numerous fire extinguishers placed in the area to put out flames should a protester attempt self-immolation.

In the traditional version of this pyrolysis process, called charcoal burning, the heat is supplied by burning part of the starting material itself, with a limited supply of oxygen. Charcoal can also be produced by heating the material in a closed retort. This process also happens while burning wood, as in a fireplace or wood stove. The visible flame in that case is actually due to combustion of the volatiles given off as the wood turns into charcoal. The soot and smoke commonly given off by wood fire result from incomplete combustion of those volatiles. Charcoal itself burns at a higher temperature than wood, with hardly a visible flame, and gives off practically no smoke, soot, or unburnt volatiles. History The production of wood charcoal in locations where there is an abundance of wood dates back to ancient times. It generally begins with piling billets of wood on their ends to form a conical pile. Openings are left at the bottom to admit air, with a central shaft serving as a flue. The whole pile is covered with turf or moistened clay. The firing is begun at the bottom of the flue, and gradually spreads outwards and upwards. The success of the operation depends upon the rate of the combustion. Under average conditions wood yields about 60% charcoal by volume, or 25% by weight; small-scale production methods often yield only about 50% by volume, while large-scale methods enabled higher yields of about 90% by the 17th century. The operation is so delicate that it was generally left to colliers (professional charcoal burners). They often lived alone in small huts to tend their wood piles. For example, in the Harz Mountains of Germany, charcoal burners lived in conical huts called K√∂ten which are extant today. An abandoned charcoal kiln near Walker, Arizona, USA. The massive production of charcoal (at its height employing hundreds of thousands, mainly in Alpine and neighbouring forests) was a major cause of deforestation, especially in Central Europe. In England, many woods were managed as coppices, which were cut and regrown cyclically, so that a steady supply of charcoal was available. Complaints (as early as the Stuart period) about shortages may relate to the results of temporary over-exploitation or the impossibility of increasing production to match growing demand. The increasing scarcity of easily harvested wood was a major factor behind the switch to fossil fuel equivalents, mainly coal and brown coal for industrial use. The modern process of carbonizing wood, either in small pieces or as sawdust in cast iron retorts, is extensively practiced where wood is scarce, and also for the recovery of valuable byproducts (wood spirit, pyroligneous acid, wood tar), which the process permits. The question of the temperature of the carbonization is important; according to J. Percy, wood becomes brown at , a deep brown-black after some time at , and an easily powdered mass at . Charcoal made at is brown, soft and friable, and readily inflames at ; made at higher temperatures it is hard and brittle, and does not fire until heated to about . In Finland and Scandinavia, the charcoal was considered the by-product of wood tar production. The best tar came from pine, thus pinewoods were cut down for tar pyrolysis. The residual charcoal was widely used as substitute for metallurgical coke in blast furnaces for smelting. Tar production led to rapid local deforestation. The end of tar production at the end of the 19th century resulted in rapid re-forestation of affected areas. The American form of the charcoal briquette was first invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer of Pennsylvania in 1897 and was produced by the Zwoyer Fuel Company. The process was further popularized by Henry Ford, who used wood and sawdust byproducts from automobile fabrication as a feedstock. Ford Charcoal went on to become the Kingsford Company.  Production methods  Charcoal under a microscope. Charcoal has been made by various methods. The traditional method in Britain used a clamp. This is essentially a pile of wooden logs (e.g. seasoned oak) leaning in a circle against a chimney. The chimney consists of 4 wooden stakes held up by some rope. The logs are completely covered with soil and straw allowing no air to enter. It must be lit by introducing some burning fuel into the chimney; the logs burn very slowly and transform into charcoal in a period of 5 days' burning. If the soil covering gets torn or cracked by the fire, additional soil is placed on the cracks. Once the burn is complete, the chimney is plugged to prevent air from entering. The true art of this production method is in managing the sufficient generation of heat, by combusting part of the wood material, and its transfer to wood parts in the process of being carbonised. A strong disadvantage of this production method is the huge amount of emissions that are harmful to human health and the environment (emissions of unburnt methane). As a result of the partial combustion of wood material, the efficiency of the traditional method is low. Modern methods employ retorting technology, in which process heat is recovered from, and solely provided by, the combustion of gas released during carbonisation. Yields of retorting are considerably higher than those of kilning, and may reach 35%-40%. The properties of the charcoal produced depend on the material charred. The charring temperature is also important. Charcoal contains varying amounts of hydrogen and oxygen as well as ash and other impurities that, together with the structure, determine the properties. The approximate composition of charcoal for gunpowders is sometimes empirically described as C7H4O. To obtain a coal with high purity, source material should be free of non-volatile compounds. Wood charcoal is obtained as the residue by destructive distillation of wood such that the products are: * Liquid products ‚Äì Pyroligneous acid and wood tar * Gaseous products ‚Äì Wood gas * Residual product ‚Äì Wood charcoal Types Binch≈çtan, Japanese high grade charcoal made from ubame oak Ogatan, charcoal briquettes made from sawdust Burning ogatan *Common charcoal is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum. *Sugar charcoal is obtained from the carbonization of sugar and is particularly pure. It is purified by boiling with acids to remove any mineral matter and is then burned for a long time in a current of chlorine to remove the last traces of hydrogen. It was used by Henri Moissan in his early attempt to create synthetic diamonds. *Activated charcoal is similar to common charcoal but is manufactured especially for medical use. To produce activated charcoal, common charcoal is heated to about in the presence of a gas (usually steam), causing the charcoal to develop many internal spaces, or \\"pores\\", which help the activated charcoal to trap chemicals. Impurities on the surface of the charcoal are also removed during this process, greatly increasing its adsorption capacity. *Lump charcoal is a traditional charcoal made directly from hardwood material. It usually produces far less ash than briquettes. *Japanese charcoal has had pyroligneous acid removed during the charcoal making; it therefore produces almost no smell or smoke when burned. The traditional charcoal of Japan is classified into three types: White charcoal (Binch≈çtan) is very hard and produces a metallic sound when struck. Ogatan is a more recent type made from hardened sawdust. *Pillow shaped briquettes are made by compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Briquettes may also include brown coal (heat source), mineral carbon (heat source), borax, sodium nitrate (ignition aid), limestone (ash- whitening agent), raw sawdust (ignition aid), and other additives. *Sawdust briquette charcoal is made by compressing sawdust without binders or additives. It is the preferred charcoal in Taiwan, Korea, Greece, and the Middle East. It has a round hole through the center, with a hexagonal intersection. It is used primarily for barbecue as it produces no odour, no smoke, little ash, high heat, and long burning hours (exceeding 4 hours). *Extruded charcoal is made by extruding either raw ground wood or carbonized wood into logs without the use of a binder. The heat and pressure of the extruding process hold the charcoal together. If the extrusion is made from raw wood material, the extruded logs are subsequently carbonized. Uses Grill charcoal made from coconut shell Charcoal has been used since earliest times for a large range of purposes including art and medicine, but by far its most important use has been as a metallurgical fuel. Charcoal is the traditional fuel of a blacksmith's forge and other applications where an intense heat is required. Charcoal was also used historically as a source of black pigment by grinding it up. In this form charcoal was important to early chemists and was a constituent of formulas for mixtures such as black powder. Due to its high surface area charcoal can be used as a filter, and as a catalyst or as an adsorbent. =Metallurgical fuel= Charcoal burns at temperatures exceeding . By comparison the melting point of iron is approximately . Due to its porosity, it is sensitive to the flow of air and the heat generated can be moderated by controlling the air flow to the fire. For this reason charcoal is still widely used by blacksmiths. Charcoal has been used for the production of iron since Roman times and steel in modern times where it also provided the necessary carbon. Charcoal briquettes can burn up to approximately with a forced air blower forge. In the 16th century, England had to pass laws to prevent the country from becoming completely denuded of trees due to production of iron. In the 19th century charcoal was largely replaced by coke in steel production due to cost. =Industrial fuel= Historically, charcoal was used in great quantities for smelting iron in bloomeries and later blast furnaces and finery forges. This use was replaced by coal in the 19th Century as part of the Industrial Revolution. =Cooking and heating fuel= Prior to the Industrial Revolution, charcoal was occasionally used as a cooking fuel. It is counted as a smokeless fuel; that is, the carbon is sufficiently pure that burning it causes substantially less air pollution that burning the original uncarbonized organic material would. In the 20th century, clean-air legislation mandated smokeless fuels (mostly coke or charcoal) in many areas of Europe. In the 21st century, charcoal has been advocated as a way to improve the health of people burning raw biomass is burned for cooking and/or heating. Modern \\"charcoal briquettes\\", widely used for outdoor cooking, are made with charcoal but may also include coal as an energy source as well as accelerants, binders and filler. = Reducing agent = Certain types of charcoal, such as wood charcoal, are used for reducing heated metallic oxides to their respective metals: * ZnO + C ‚Üí Zn + CO * Fe2O3 \\\\+ 3C ‚Üí 2Fe + 3CO Charcoal can also be used to reduce super heated steam to hydrogen (along with the formation of carbon monoxide): * C + H2O (1000 ¬∞C) ‚Üí H2 \\\\+ CO (Water gas) =Syngas production, automotive fuel= Like many other sources of carbon, charcoal can be used for the production of various syngas compositions; i.e., various CO + H2 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ N2 mixtures. The syngas is typically used as fuel, including automotive propulsion, or as a chemical feedstock. In times of scarce petroleum, automobiles and even buses have been converted to burn wood gas (a gas mixture consisting primarily of diluting atmospheric nitrogen, but also containing combustible gasses, mostly carbon monoxide) released by burning charcoal or wood in a wood gas generator. In 1931 Tang Zhongming developed an automobile powered by charcoal, and these cars were popular in China until the 1950s and in occupied France during World War II (called gazog√®nes). =Pyrotechnics= Charcoal is used in the production of black powder, which is used extensively in the production of fireworks. It is usually ground into a fine powder, with airfloat grade being the finest particle size available commercially. When used in black powder compositions, it is often ball-milled with other ingredients so that they are intimately mixed together. Certain charcoals perform better when used to make black powder, these include spruce, willow, paulownia and grapevine among others. Charcoal produces fine dark orange/golden sparks. Usually, powder with a mesh size from 10 to 325 is used to obtain showers of golden sparks in pyrotechnic compositions. = Cosmetic use of bamboo charcoal = Charcoal is also incorporated in multiple cosmetic products. It can be produced a.o. from regular bamboo cut into small pieces and boiled in water to remove soluble compounds. Raw bamboo charcoal is obtained after drying and carbonization in an oven at elevated temperature. The role of charcoal in cosmetics is based on its highly effective absorbing properties at a microscopic-scale. = Carbon source = Charcoal may be used as a source of carbon in chemical reactions. One example of this is the production of carbon disulphide through the reaction of sulfur vapors with hot charcoal. In that case the wood should be charred at high temperature to reduce the residual amounts of hydrogen and oxygen that lead to side reactions. =Purification and filtration= Activated carbon Charcoal may be activated to increase its effectiveness as a filter. Activated charcoal readily adsorbs a wide range of organic compounds dissolved or suspended in gases and liquids. In certain industrial processes, such as the purification of sucrose from cane sugar, impurities cause an undesirable color, which can be removed with activated charcoal. It is also used to absorb odors and toxins in gases, such as air. Charcoal filters are also used in some types of gas masks. The medical use of activated charcoal is mainly the absorption of poisons. Activated charcoal is available without a prescription, so it is used for a variety of health-related applications. For example, it is often used to reduce discomfort and embarrassment due to excessive gas (flatulence) in the digestive tract. Animal charcoal or bone black is the carbonaceous residue obtained by the dry distillation of bones. It contains only about 10% carbon, the remaining being calcium and magnesium phosphates (80%) and other inorganic material originally present in the bones. It is generally manufactured from the residues obtained in the glue and gelatin industries. Its decolorizing power was applied in 1812 by Derosne to the clarification of the syrups obtained in sugar refining; but its use in this direction has now greatly diminished, owing to the introduction of more active and easily managed reagents. It is still used to some extent in laboratory practice. The decolorizing power is not permanent, becoming lost after using for some time; it may be revived, however, by washing and reheating. Wood charcoal also to some extent removes coloring material from solutions, but animal charcoal is generally more effective. =Art= Four sticks of vine charcoal and four sticks of compressed charcoal Two charcoal pencils in paper sheaths that are unwrapped as the pencil is used, and two charcoal pencils in wooden sheaths Charcoal is used in art for drawing, making rough sketches in painting and is one of the possible media for making a parsemage. It must usually be preserved by the application of a fixative. Artists generally utilize charcoal in three forms: * Vine charcoal is created by burning grape vines. * Willow charcoal is created by burning sticks. * Powdered charcoal is often used to \\"tone\\" or cover large sections of a drawing surface. Drawing over the toned areas darkens it further, but the artist can also lighten (or completely erase) within the toned area to create lighter tones. * Compressed charcoal charcoal powder mixed with gum binder compressed into round or square sticks. The amount of binder determines the hardness of the stick. Compressed charcoal is used in charcoal pencils. =Horticulture= One additional use of charcoal was rediscovered recently for horticulture. Although American gardeners have used charcoal for a short time, research on Terra preta soils in Amazonia has discovered the widespread use of charcoal produced by pyrolysis in the absence of oxygen, i. e. biochar, by pre-Columbian natives to ameliorate unproductive soil into soil that is rich in carbon. The technique may find modern application, both to improve soils and as a means of carbon sequestration. =Animal husbandry = Charcoal is mixed with feed, added to litter, or used in the treatment of the manure. Poultry benefits from using charcoal in this manner. A concern that activated charcoal might be used unscrupulously to allow livestock to tolerate low quality feed contaminated with aflatoxins resulted in the Association of American Feed Control Officials banning it in 2012 from use in commercial livestock feeds. =Medicine= Charcoal pile Charcoal was consumed in the past as dietary supplement for gastric problems in the form of charcoal biscuits. Now it can be consumed in tablet, capsule or powder form, for digestive effects. Research regarding its effectiveness is controversial.Am J Gastroenterology 2005 Feb 100(2)397‚Äì400 and 1999 Jan 94(1) 208-12 Charcoal has been used in combination with saccharin in research to measure mucociliary transport time. Charcoal has also been incorporated in toothpaste formulas; however, there is no evidence to determine its safety and effectiveness. Red colobus monkeys in Africa have been observed eating charcoal for the purposes of self-medication. Their leafy diets contain high levels of cyanide, which may lead to indigestion. So they learned to consume charcoal, which absorbs the cyanide and relieves indigestion. This knowledge about supplementing their diet is transmitted from mother to infant. Environmental sustainability Production and utilisation of charcoal, like any use of woody biomass as fuel, typically results in emissions and can contribute to deforestation. The use of charcoal as a smelting fuel has been experiencing a resurgence in South America resulting in severe environmental, social and medical problems. Charcoal production at a sub-industrial level is one of the causes of deforestation. Charcoal production is now usually illegal and nearly always unregulated as in Brazil where charcoal production is a large illegal industry for making pig iron.The documentary film The Charcoal People (2000) shows in detail the deforestation in Brazil, the poverty of the laborers and their families, and the method of constructing and using a clamp for burning the wood. Massive forest destruction has been documented in areas such as Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is considered a primary threat to the survival of the mountain gorillas. Similar threats are found in Zambia. In Malawi, illegal charcoal trade employs 92,800 workers and is the main source of heat and cooking fuel for 90 percent of the nation's population. Some experts, such as Duncan MacQueen, Principal Researcher‚ÄìForest Team, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), argue that while illegal charcoal production causes deforestation, a regulated charcoal industry that required replanting and sustainable use of the forests \\"would give their people clean efficient energy ‚Äì and their energy industries a strong competitive advantage\\". Recent assessments of charcoal imported to Europe have shown that many charcoal products are produced from tropical wood, often of undeclared origin. In an analysis of barbecue charcoal marketed in Germany, the World Wildlife Fund finds that most products contain tropical wood. As a notable exception, reference is made to barbecue charcoal imports from Namibia, where charcoal is typically produced from surplus biomass resulting from bush encroachment. In popular culture The last section of the film Le Quattro Volte (2010) gives a good and long, if poetic, documentation of the traditional method of making charcoal. The Arthur Ransome children's series Swallows and Amazons (particularly the second book, Swallowdale) features carefully drawn vignettes of the lives and the techniques of charcoal burners at the start of the 20th century, in the Lake District of the UK. Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's opera King and Charcoal Burner is based on a Czech legend about a king who gets lost in a forest and is rescued by a charcoal burner.

French nationals make up the second largest European immigrant group in Mexico, after Spaniards. Migration history French immigration to Mexico started after Mexico became an independent country in 1821, as foreign immigration was prohibited by Spanish authorities under the colonial regime. The first wave of French immigration to Mexico occurred in the 1830s, following the country's recognition by France, with the foundation of a French colony on the Coatzacoalcos River, in the state of Veracruz. In total, 668 settlers were brought from France to populate the colony. Most of them went back to France as the project of colonization failed, but some permanently settled in Mexico. In 1833, another colony was founded in the state of Veracruz as well, under the name of Jicaltepec. A second wave of French immigration came to Mexico at the end of the 1840s, during the California Gold Rush (at the time gold was discovered, California was still part of the Mexican territory). As a consequence, in 1849 French represented the second foreign community in Mexico after Spaniards. Between 1850 and 1914, Mexico received 11,000 French immigrants. According to the 2010 Census, French people form the second largest European emigrant community in Mexico after Spaniards, and eleventh overall immigrant community. There are around 9,500 French nationals registered in Mexico and about 6,000 to 7,000 Frenchmen unregistered. Two thirds of them are Mexicans of French ancestry holding double nationality. Many Mexicans of French descent live in cities and states such as Zacatecas, San Luis Potos√≠, Aguascalientes, Veracruz, Guanajuato, Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and Mexico City.  Second Mexican Empire  Most French Mexicans descend from immigrants and soldiers that settled in Mexico during the Second Mexican Empire, headed by Maximilian I of Mexico and masterminded by Emperor Napoleon III of France in the 1860s to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term or Am√©rique latine, or 'Latin America'). Emperor Maximilian's consort, Carlota of Mexico, a Belgian princess, was a granddaughter of Louis-Philippe of France.  The \\"Barcelonnettes\\"  The largest wave of immigration from France to Mexico came from the city of Barcelonnette, in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Between 1850 and 1950, 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants of the Ubaye Valley immigrated to Mexico. Many established textile businesses between Mexico and France. While 90% stayed in Mexico, some returned to Barcelonette, and from 1880 to 1930, built grand mansions called Maisons Mexicaines and left a mark upon the city. Today, there are 60,000 descendants of the \\"Barcelonnettes\\".  French settlement in Veracruz  French home in Paso de Telaya, San Rafael, Veracruz. In 1833, 98 personsLa colonisation fran√ßaise de Jicaltepec, Veracruz coming from Haute- Sa√¥ne, Haute-Marne, C√¥te-d'Or and Yonne settled in a colony called Jicaltepec, in the state of Veracruz. In 1874, the community resettled on the other bank of the river, in San Rafael. From 1880 to 1900 the population of the colony grew from 800 to 1,000 inhabitants. There are now around 10,000 French Mexicans in the state of Veracruz.  Involvement in World War II  Jean Ren√© Champion, a Mexican of French ancestry, was the first Free French Forces (Forces Fran√ßaises Libres) officer to enter Paris on the day when the city was liberated from the Nazis on August 26, 1944. The Art Nouveau Palacio de Hierro in Orizaba, Veracruz was designed by Gustave Eiffel. French contributions to Mexican society  The French introduced cultural traits adopted by the Mexican culture and may have helped coin the term ‚ÄúMariachi‚Äù, though it is not certain. The word ‚ÄúMariachi‚Äù may have originated during French Napoleonic rule in the 1860s since French settler families used the music during weddings(marriage). Clark attributes this to \\"phonetic coincidence\\" (Clark, 1996). An important culinary contribution was the bolillo, which is now widely used for the torta. The French also heavily influenced Mexico's pan dulce.

The inauguration ‚Äì the last non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to take place in the 20th century ‚Äì marked the commencement of Gerald Ford's only term (a partial term of ) as President. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the oath of office. The Bible upon which Ford recited the oath was held by his wife, Betty Ford, open to Proverbs 3:5‚Äì6. Ford was the ninth vice president to succeed to the presidency intra-term, and he remains the most recent to do so. Although this was the ninth non- scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to take place since the presidency was established in 1789, it was the first to take place due to the president's resignation. Ford had only become Vice President eight months earlier, after the resignation of Spiro Agnew due to bribery allegations while serving as Governor of Maryland. He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Thus, when he succeeded Nixon, Ford became the first (and remains the only) person to have held both the office of Vice President and President without having been elected to either. Nixon's farewell The Fords escort the Nixons across the South Lawn of the White House to Army One before Gerald Ford takes the oath of office, August 9, 1974 V-for-victory sign as he departs the White House after resigning In a televised Oval Office speech on August 8, 1974, President Richard Nixon, who was facing impeachment proceedings for his role in the Watergate scandal and alleged cover-up, announced to the nation that he would resign the Presidency of the United States \\"effective at noon tomorrow [August 9].\\" At 9:00 am the following morning, Nixon gave a farewell talk to an East Room assembly of White House staff and selected dignitaries, including the Cabinet and Vice President Ford. It was an emotional event, with President Nixon nearly breaking down a number of times. When it was finished, Vice President Ford escorted the President and First Lady to an Army helicopter, where the President waved his famous \\"v-sign\\" before flying off to Air Force One and a flight to \\"exile\\" in California. The nuclear codes were left with Ford. Ford's swearing-in Nixon's resignation was tendered to United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at 11:35 am. At that moment, Ford became the 38th President of the United States, although he took the official oath of office at 12:05 pm. Once the former President (and now private citizen) Nixon left the building, the White House staff began preparations for Ford's swearing in. More chairs were added for the much larger crowd of invited guests than was at the farewell. The oath was administered to Ford by Chief Justice Warren Burger in the White House East Room. Chief Justice Burger was traveling in the Netherlands at the time, and was flown back to Washington on an Air Force plane. The first phone call that President Ford, a former center on the University of Michigan football team, made after his inauguration was on Saturday, August 10, 1974, to Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes, who had just recently suffered a heart attack. Remarks upon swearing- in Immediately after taking the presidential oath, Ford gave a speech (authored by Counselor to the President Robert T. Hartmann) alluding in his remarks to the unique and \\"extraordinary circumstances\\" that led to his ascension to the presidency: Immediately after the 850-word address was over, Ford introduced his new press secretary, Jerald terHorst to the press corps, and met with the Cabinet. Ford asked Henry Kissinger to stay on as Secretary of State in the new administration. Later that day, Ford met with ambassadors of the NATO nations.

After the sudden death of his father, he was faced with the responsibility of becoming the primary caretaker of his household with his father's debts to pay.Yas Biography in bio98 Yas was forced to leave his college ambitions behind and begin to work and support his entire family. It was at this time that he began to write poetry which soon turned into lyrics for his music.Yas Tunes Biography Music career Yas started his work after the 2003 Bam earthquake. Devastated by the disaster, it was then, that he wrote his first song \\"Bam\\". This was the beginning of his rapping career. He realized that through rap music he had the ability to reach people by telling full stories that he thought was not easy to do through other forms of music which only consisted of a few versus and a chorus. Realizing that through his music, he had the ability to inspire people and reach millions of other young people in Iran.Yas Biography in Fanpop Yas in 2006 made a song called CD Ro Beshkan (Break The Disk) which was written about a well known female actress Zahra Amir Ebrahimi in Iran who was the victim of a Sex scandal tape. The scandal ultimately ended her blossoming career. In the song Yas criticizes the people for playing a role in her demise and asked everyone to stop spreading her shame and to get rid of that infamous footage from their computers and cellphones. The song was listened to and downloaded by millions in Iran alone. His music has crossed the International waters and he is becoming the voice of his generation or Iranians inside and outside of their country.First hits song Yas Yas in June 2008 made a song called Hoviate Man [my identity] describing his pride in his Iranian heritage and a mention of the controversial 300 film. The song has become sort of a national anthem for the younger generations especially the Iranian diaspora that are eager to connect to their rich culture and history. His music has set a new standard for Persian rap and has inspired many up and coming rappers to follow his lead and sing of more meaningful and positive messages in their own music.Worldwide Concert Tour Dates Yas Yas in 2008 made and wrote a song named \\"Darkam Kon\\" (Understand me). Yas's music was a protest to the government and for poverty and people who can't find jobs. Yas performing in 2018. In May 2011 Yas made a song called \\"Az Chi Begam\\" (What Can I Say) which is a protest song for those schoolchildren who suffered from a fire in addition to injustice and misery, like their fellow countrymen. Yas‚Äôs voice rises against the negligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in providing substandard facilities, in this case a very old oil burning heater, which caused eight 7-year-old schoolchildren burned in Doroudzan village‚Äôs school disaster. Yas wrote and performed this song when popular Korean drama series Jumong kept the majority of Iran's population preoccupied that they did not notice the fire or the limitations a real Iranian artist has to tolerate. Yas presents the material circumstances of Iran in which production and importation are the monopoly of a small group of people, the ones in power, living in palaces and towers. He suggests that aristocrats maintain the status quo while the majority fall into the abyss of false consciousness through manipulation from selected entertainment productions. However, he selects his position as an artist trying to find a solution to social problems by creating his own art and literature.

ERGEG was set up by the European Commission to assist the commission in consolidating a single EU market for electricity and gas. ERGEG's members are the heads of the national energy regulatory authorities in the EU's 28 Member States. Foundation and Mission ERGEG was set up by the European Commission (Decision of 11 November 2003 2003/796/EC) as its advisory body on internal energy market issues. It is made up of the national energy regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. Its purpose is to facilitate a consistent application, in all Member States, of the provisions set out in Internal Market in Electricity DirectiveDirective 2003/54/EC, Directive 2003/55/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, as well as of possible future EU legislation in the field of electricity and gas\\". With the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) fully operational (since March 2011), ERGEG was dissolved by the European Commission (Commission Decision of 16 May 2011 repealing Decision 2003/796/EC) with effect from 1 July 2011. All past works relating to ERGEG activity (documents, reports, public consultations etc.) can be found on this website of the European Energy Regulators. Objectives and Functions The role and aim of the ERGEG was to advise and assist the European Commission in ensuring the creation and smooth functioning of the internal energy market in Europe. ERGEG facilitates consultation, coordination and cooperation of national energy regulators contributing to a consistent application, in all Member States, of EU energy legislation. In advising the European Commission ERGEG worked transparently and was committed to best regulatory practice in terms of conducting its public consultations and engaging with stakeholders. From ERGEG to ACER Since March 2011, a new organisation, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) became fully operational. ACER was established following the entry into force of third energy liberalisation legislative package (3rd Package) on 3 September 2009, has been assigned a series of tasks and responsibilities in relation to Europe's electricity and gas markets. ACER is a European Community body with legal personality, funded by the EU budget, with a staff of around 50 persons. With ACER fully operational, ERGEG was formally dissolved by the European Commission, with effect from 1 July 2011. ERGEG's work Some examples of what ERGEG, the energy regulators' advisory group to the European Commission, did in practice: * ERGEG Regional Initiatives One of ERGEG's flagship projects was the Regional Initiatives, which it launched with the European Commission's backing in Spring 2006, in an effort to speed up the integration of Europe's national energy markets. The ERGEG Regional Initiatives establish 7 electricity and 3 regional gas markets in Europe as an intermediate step to the creation of a single, competitive EU market in electricity and gas. Since 2011, ACER takes over responsibility for the Regional Initiatives. * Monitoring compliance with existing rules ERGEG carried out extensive monitoring of compliance with rules (e.g. transparency, access, and implementation of consumer rights) and advised the European Commission accordingly. To assist in the practical implementation of the principles set out in the current energy laws, ERGEG developed Guidelines of Good Practice (GGPs) in certain areas. ERGEG GGPs are voluntary guidelines (i.e. not legally enforceable) which are developed in consultation with stakeholders. * Advising the European Commission on legislative proposals ERGEG advised and assisted the European Commission in the preparation of draft implementing measures in the field of electricity and gas. For example, ERGEG provided significant input to the European Commission in the preparation of its third energy liberalisation legislative package proposals (September 2007). Members ERGEG members were the national energy regulatory authorities of the 28 EU Member States. The European Commission is represented at a high level. The energy regulators of the countries who are candidates for accession to the EU and the countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) participated in ERGEG meetings as Observers.

He is known for his \\"Terrorist\\" collection. Life and career Hassanzadeh was born in 1963 in Tehran, to a working class Azerbaijani family who were fruit-sellers. He was just 17 years when the Iran-Iraq war broke out, and he dropped out of school and enlisted in the Basiji militia, but was subsequently obliged to remain as a conscript.Issa, R., PƒÅkbƒÅz, R. and Shayegan, D., Iranian Contemporary Art, Booth-Clibborn Editions, 2001, p. 26; Daragahi, B., \\"Iranian Artists Inspired by Adversity,\\" Los Angeles Times, 27 March, 2011, Online: When he returned from the war, he chose to work on themes that reflected his experiences of war.Fard, H.J., \\"Iranian Painters for Peace,\\" Peace Review, Vol. 25, No.2 , pp 284-290, DOI:10.1080/10402659.2013.785334 Following his return to civilian life, he studied art, enrolling in the Mojtama-e-Honar University (1989‚Äì91) where he studied painting and later at the Persian Literature at Azad University (1995‚Äì99), both in Tehran.Amirsadeghi, H., Different Sames: New Perspectives in Contemporary Iranian Art, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 50 His art teachers advised him to \\"draw small\\" so that his work would be marketable, but he ignored this advice. From the outset, he was determined to paint large murals and posters. Los Angeles Times, 27 March, 2011, Online: He first exhibited in the 1980s, but only gained international recognition with War (1998), a grim and trenchant diary of his own experiences as a volunteer soldier during the Iran-Iraq war (1980‚Äì1988). In Ashura (2000) a 'women-friendly' interpretation of the most revered Shiite religious ceremony, he depicted chador-clad women engulfed by religious iconography. Chador (2001) and Prostitutes (2002) continued his exploration of sociological themes particular to Iran's hyper-gendered urban landscape. Shatanawi, M., \\"The Disquieting Art of Khosrow Hassanzadeh,\\" ISIM Review, vol. 18,, no. 1, 2006, pp 55-56 The latter paintings used police mug shots to pay tribute to sixteen prostitutes killed by a serial killer in Mashhad, a religious capital of Iran. The paintings were created after filmmaker Maziar Bahari commissioned Hassanzadeh to create a poster for his film, And Along Came a Spider. In Terrorist (2004) the artist questions the concept of 'terrorism' in international politics by portraying himself, his mother and sisters as 'terrorists'. Unlike many of his contemporaries who have left Iran, Hassanzadeh has chosen to continue to live and work as an artist in Iran.Clare, C., Subversive Ceramics, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, p. 148 He is currently based in Tehran, where he works as an actor, visual artist and ceramist. His work featured in many exhibitions in Europe and the Middle East. Time magazine described him as one of the country's \\"hottest\\" artists. Time, Vol. 169, 2007, p. 39 Work His works often deal with issues that are considered sensitive in Iranian society and therefore he is frequently referred to as a 'political' artist or 'pop' artist. Scholars have described his style as somewhere between dissident and regime art.Clare, C., Subversive Ceramics, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, p. 148-149 The artist, himself, calls his work \\"people's art\\" because it deals with social issues that affect everyday people. Daragahi, B., \\"Iranian Artists Inspired by Adversity,\\" Los Angeles Times, 27 March, 2011, Online: His work is influenced by the Saqqa Kaneh movement and traditional Iranian art. He has had solo shows in Amsterdam, Beirut, Dubai, London, Phnom Penh, and Tehran. His work is held by the British Museum, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, the World Bank and the Tropenmuseum.

Lily and Marshall reflect on a tradition of Lily bringing a six-pack of beer with her every time she returns from a trip and they decide to end the tradition, but independently change their minds. Marshall gets Robin to drive him to the airport in the midst of the snow storm to pick up Lily, arguing with her about the importance of traditions in relationships. They get trapped on the side of the road after a snow plow covers them in snow due to Robin ignoring his warnings to deliver a rant, but they eventually get to the airport terminal. When they arrive, Lily is not there. Marshall realizes that that day's lunchtime phone-call ritual between himself and Lily had been in a voicemail Lily had left that her flight back to New York City has been delayed for two more days due to the snow storm. Marshall ignored the call because he felt that all of their traditions were slipping away and that it was a natural progression of their relationship to let their rituals die, from the lunchtime phone-call to the New Year's kiss. After realizing she wants to continue the tradition, Lily tries to find some vintage Seattle beer. Arriving at the airport an hour early, she encounters Ranjit, and they drive to a local liquor store, only to find that the store only has a keg. She does not find Marshall at the airport. Suddenly, airport residents, the \\"Fighting Hens\\", start playing marching band instruments to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", and Marshall greets Lily. Marshall asks if he now has to bring a marching band each time he picks up Lily.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A rating. Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 8.3 out of 10, commenting that it was \\"a good episode\\" but pointing out a storyline flaw as \\"you can't take liquids on a plane anymore\\". The TV Critic rated the episode 67 out of 100, describing the humour as \\"decent\\" and praising the twist at the end. Cindy McLennan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A‚àí.

The film is adapted loosely from the 1912 novel The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, but the film bears a closer resemblance to the remake of King Kong released in the same year, particularly as both stories center on a giant ape. Hence, King of the Lost World is a mockbuster of said film, a tradition that The Asylum usually undergoes. Plot A plane crashes in a remote jungle. Many survive, but the front end of the plane and the cockpit are nowhere to be found. The only way to seek help is to find the cockpit and radio a message. Ed Malone (Jeff Denton) climbs a small hill and sees the cockpit about a mile distant. A group decides to leave the plane to search for the radio. John Roxton (Rhett Giles) leads the group through the jungle. The remaining survivors stay at the crash site in case a plane passes by. The group arrives at the fuselage to learn that it's not part of the plane they crashed in. In addition, the radio and critical instruments have been stripped and removed. They are startled by the arrival of Lieutenant Colonel Challenger (Bruce Boxleitner), who managed to travel alone to the downed plane, carrying a briefcase he doesn't seem to want to part with. The group continues to look for the cockpit with some individuals being killed or lost along the way. They encounter a military plane. Challenger tries to rig a missile as a signal gun, but fails. The group finds a cavern for shelter that night, and are attacked by giant scorpions. John and Tianka are killed, while a desperate Ed, Challenger, Rita, Dana, and Natalie flee for safety. As they escape from the stream, they are captured by natives living on a plateau. It is learned that the natives have been stripping the planes to avoid outsiders. The natives are discovered to be survivors from a crash long ago, and have developed a sacrificial rite to appease the creatures of the jungle. Dana and Natalie are brainwashed into joining them, while Ed is chosen as the sacrifice. However, the sacrificial ceremony fails when a giant ape attacks, and Dana (who faked being brainwashed) saves Ed. They meet up with Challenger and Rita, then spot military jets overhead, moving in to attack the giant ape, but are destroyed. Challenger is killed by a native, leaving Ed alone to fight the ape. Ed detonates a nuclear bomb from a crashed plane and successfully kills the ape, but also destroys their cockpit, trapping Ed, Rita, and Dana in the jungle. They contemplate dying, to which Ed tersely replies: \\"Not today\\" before kissing Rita. Cast * Bruce Boxleitner as Lt.

In this film he is American. * In the novel, the character of Professor Challenger was a misanthropic scientist. In this film, he is a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force. * The character of Professor Summerlee is now a woman named Rita Summerlee. * The expedition in the novel originally journeyed to the Lost World to prove Prof. Challenger's claims that dinosaurs lived in modern times. In the film, the expedition accidentally crash-land into the Lost World. * There was no giant ape in the novel, the original antagonists were a race of ape-men living in the Lost World. *In the film, the characters are stranded on an island, however, in the novel and previous film adaptions, the story takes place on a plateau. *There are giant scorpions, giant spiders, man-eating vines and giant winged lizards in the film. In the novel there are only dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. * In the movie many characters, including Challenger and John Roxton die. However they survive in the original novel. Reception HorrorTalk found the movie to be one of the Asylum's best, stating \\"The bottom line is King is a fun romp through the jungle from beginning to end.\\" Dread Central agreed it was a better work, but criticized the third act as convoluted, as well as the lack of the titular ape.

The six retreating collaborationist units who joined Siegling included Bataillon 57 (ukrainische), Bataillon 60 (wei√üruthenische), Bataillon 61, 62, 63 (ukrainische), and Bataillon 64 (wei√üruthenische). Background Most members of the Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling originated from the pro-Nazi Belarusian Home Defence (BKA). The total number of soldiers evacuated by the Nazis to East Prussia from across Belarus during the Soviet advance might have reached 10,000. They regrouped northeast of Warsaw in occupied Poland, under the command of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Hans Siegling who was also the SS-and-Police leader of the White Ruthenia. The new Brigade consisted of 4 rifle regiments as well as artillery and cavalry unit. It was renamed by Himmler in August 1944, as the 30th Waffen-Grenadier- Division der SS (russische Nr. 2). It consisted of men from the former Soviet Union, mainly from Belarus, including whole Kommandanturas of Bielaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona (BKA) and participants in Vlasov's movement, but also units of the German Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo), Sicherheitsdienst (SD), and Ordnungsdienst from the area. By November 1944, the battalion whose formation started in August originally ‚Äì as the Schuma Brigade Siegling ‚Äì was transported to France as the 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian). While in France, the brigade remained under the leadership of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Hans Siegling. By February 10, 1945 the formation was nearly wiped out by mass Belarusian desertion and by the Allies. Only one regiment was left. Some reinforcements came from other formations, but not enough. The battalion was renamed again as the 30th SS Grenadier Division (1st White Ruthenian) or Wei√üruthenische Nr. 1 (in German), but in April 1945, it was entirely disbanded.Georg Tessin, Verbande und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen SS im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939-1945 Vierter Band: Die Landstreitkrafte 15‚Äî30 Frankfurt/Main: Verlag E. S. Mittler & Sohn GmbH, 1970. See: Lexikon.  Formation of Schuma Brigade Siegling Belarusian Shuma in March 1943 The German forces along with the Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian collaborators under the German command were pushed out from the Belorussian SSR during the Soviet Operation Bagration of August 1944. They gradually retreated west from the GK Wei√üruthenien (as it was called then) toward occupied eastern Poland between June 22 and August 19, 1944. Dozens of units remained scattered around. The German forces included remnants of the SiPo, SD, and Ordnungsdienst. Among them, was also units of Bielaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona (BKA) and the Belarusian Kommandantura personnel. At the end of June 1944 the SS commander Curt von Gottberg issued an order to create the Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling which by July 20, 1944 was formed and prepared for duty. The formation of the brigade's four regiments was completed by July 31, 1944 ‚Äì all 4 regiments were named after their commanders were stationed at that time at different places: 1st Regiment at Grady under command of Sturmbannf√ºhrer Hans √ñsterreich, 2nd regiment at Stawicz - commander Sturmbannf√ºhrer Helmuth Gantz, 3rd regiment at Czartoriak ‚Äì commander Sturmbannf√ºhrer Wilhelm Mocha and 4th regiment ‚Äì commander Sturmbannf√ºhrer Ernst Schmidt. Artillery unit was stationed at Suliny. Brigade also has a cavalry unit. Approximate number of the personnel is estimated as follows: up to 6 thousand auxiliary Ordnungspolizei, 2 thousand SD men, and up to 8 thousand members of the Bielaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona. They were spread over many locations in East Prussia. Belarusian Auxiliary Police Battalion Siegling in 1944 Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling in its full formation operated in Belarus from late July 1944. In August 1944 (possibly earlier) an order was issued to form a division formation from Brigade Siegling - thus all personnel was transferred from the rank-and-file of the Ordnungspolizei formations to the SS command. Under the new leadership, the brigade was renamed as the 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian) on August 18, 1944. The Division was composed of the following regiments: Waffen- Gren.Rgt. d. SS 75 (russ. Nr. 4), Waffen-Gren.Rgt. d. SS 76 (russ. Nr. 5) (consisted of three battalions each), Waffen-Artillerie-Rgt d. SS 30 (russ. Art.Rgt. 2) (consisted of three artillery batteries) and Replacement Regiment were created. The combat-ready units of the Brigade Siegling were transferred to France to participate in operations against the French Resistance. The transfer of all units in a brigade-size formation to France was decided under general command of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Hans Siegling. Siegling led dozens of Nazi security warfare operations in Belarus since 1941 as the commander of the 57th Schuma regiment (Schutzmannschaft Bataillon 57).One of the reasons for the transfer to France ‚Äì apart from other military objectives ‚Äì was that Schuma suffered from persistent desertion. For example, once they acquired military weapons, the local Poles left en masse and joined the underground Armia Krajowa among other Polish anti-Nazi resistance forces, to attack their yesterday masters. On 6 August 1944, the unit received an order to take part in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising, however, the idea was abandoned. Instead, it was used from August 12 in East Prussia for the harvest collection. Some combat ready units of the brigade were transferred to France in August 1944 fight against the French Resistance.

History  Hutchinson was born in Calcutta, India on Oct. 11, 1932. He was the illegitimate child of Hon. Eric Douglas ‚Äì a Scottish nobleman - and his 15-year-old Anglo-Indian servant Florence. However, despite (or perhaps because of) his noble parentage, he was given to an orphanage, Dr. Graham's Homes in Kalimpongat the age of four months. He later discovered his parentage while going through the files at the Home. He eventually met his mother, when she was a widow living in poverty in Calcutta. He never met his father. Lady Mountbatten, a patron of the orphanage, made note of the young Hutchinson's artistic talent. A portrait of Lady Mountbatten was commissioned, as was a portrait of the orphanage founder Dr. Graham. These early paintings sealed his artistic fate and future: both paintings still survive. The young Hutchinson met and fell in love with Gloria Mudaliar, of Russian and Indian heritage (whose parents had owned a circus!). They married in 1955 and moved to London in 1959, with her sister and their two young children. He eventually started an engineering company which became very successful, though he continued his paintings on the side, with Gloria his most frequent subject. His portrait commissions continued to come in, albeit irregularly; it was his painting of the Queen Mother, wearing the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond from India, that brought him fame, and, to a certain extent, fortune. The family bought two farmhouses in the south of France, with an extensive garden, which they renovated in Indian style. In 1988, they revisited India for the first time and made capital contributions toward a new dormitory at the orphanage where Hutchinson grew up. They eventually moved to Morocco. As a painter, Hutchinson's works include portraits of Nehru, Prince Philip, Elizabeth and the Queen Mother.  Death  Hutchinson died on the evening of 24 June 2010 at his home in Marrakech, Morocco. His wife still lives in Dar el Mudal today, and rents out rooms to visitors.

The Elisabeth-Anna-Palais is a secular red-brick building in Oldenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, located at the northeast of the Schlossgarten Oldenburg, close to the Schloss Oldenburg. History Usually the ducal family resided in Schloss Oldenburg, but Frederick Augustus (from 1900 the last ruling grand duke of Oldenburg) decided to build this as their new home, on a site now between the Schloss and the Augusteum. It was built between 1894 and 1896 to plans by the duke's chief architect Ludwig Freese. Its design imitates Baroque architecture and its southeastern corner (today its left-hand entrance) has an onion-dome-topped tower. During construction Frederick Augustus's wife Princess Elisabeth Anna of Prussia (1857‚Äì95) died and the new building was named in her memory. On 24 October 1896 Frederick Augustus moved into the new residence with his family and his second wife Duchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (born 1869, daughter of Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin). However, revolutionaries forced the Grand Duke to raise the red flag from the flagpoles of the Palais and the Schloss on 8 November 1918 and three days later he renounced his dukedom and retired to his Schloss Rastede at Rastede. After his resignation, the Palais was used for other purposes. The kitchen wing to the east of the main building was demolished in the early 1960s to make room for the new \\"Schlosswall\\" street, though the Palais was now sited right on this new road and thus gained a new entrance. The Palais now houses the Sozialgericht Oldenburg.

The STRING database contains information from numerous sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods and public text collections. It is freely accessible and it is regularly updated. The resource also serves to highlight functional enrichments in user-provided lists of proteins, using a number of functional classification systems such as GO, Pfam and KEGG. The latest version 10.5 contains information on about 9.6 million proteins from more than 2000 organisms. STRING has been developed by a consortium of academic institutions including CPR, EMBL, KU, SIB, TUD and UZH. Usage Protein‚Äìprotein interaction networks are an important ingredient for the system-level understanding of cellular processes. Such networks can be used for filtering and assessing functional genomics data and for providing an intuitive platform for annotating structural, functional and evolutionary properties of proteins. Exploring the predicted interaction networks can suggest new directions for future experimental research and provide cross-species predictions for efficient interaction mapping. Protein‚Äìprotein interaction network visualized by STRING. In this view, the color saturation of the edges represents the confidence score of a functional association Features The data is weighted and integrated and a confidence score is calculated for all protein interactions. Results of the various computational predictions can be inspected from different designated views. There are two modes of STRING: Protein-mode and COG-mode. Predicted interactions are propagated to proteins in other organisms for which interaction has been described by inference of orthology. A web interface is available to access the data and to give a fast overview of the proteins and their interactions. A plug-in for cytoscape to use STRING data is available. Another possibility to access data STRING is to use the application programming interface (API) by constructing a URL that contain the request. Data sources Like many other databases that store protein association knowledge, STRING imports data from experimentally derived protein‚Äìprotein interactions through literature curation. Furthermore, STRING also store computationally predicted interactions from: (i) text mining of scientific texts, (ii) interactions computed from genomic features, and (iii) interactions transferred from model organisms based on orthology. All predicted or imported interactions are benchmarked against a common reference of functional partnership as annotated by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). =Imported data= STRING imports protein association knowledge from databases of physical interaction and databases of curated biological pathway knowledge (MINT, HPRD, BIND, DIP, BioGRID, KEGG, Reactome, IntAct, EcoCyc, NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database, GO). Links are supplied to the originating data of the respective experimental repositories and database resources. =Text mining= A large body of scientific texts (SGD, OMIM, FlyBase, PubMed) are parsed to search for statistically relevant co- occurrences of gene names. =Predicted data= * Neighborhood: Similar genomic context in different species suggest a similar function of the proteins. * Fusion-fission events: Proteins that are fused in some genomes are very likely to be functionally linked (as in other genomes where the genes are not fused). * Occurrence: Proteins that have a similar function or an occurrence in the same metabolic pathway, must be expressed together and have similar phylogenetic profile. * Coexpression: Predicted association between genes based on observed patterns of simultaneous expression of genes.

The Main Hall. Schloss Oldenburg (Oldenburg palace) is a schloss, or palace, in the city of Oldenburg in the present-day state of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the former residence of the counts (1667‚Äì1785), dukes (1785‚Äì1815) and grand dukes (1815‚Äì1918) of Oldenburg. The building now houses part of the State Museum for Art and Cultural History, especially its decorative arts and local history exhibitions, as well as some old master paintings. Immediately outside the palace to the west and north is the Schlossplatz. Opposite it, to the north, is the Schlossh√∂fe shopping mall, opened in 2011. To the south are the Prinzenpalais and Augusteum, also part of the State Museum for Art and Cultural History. To the southwest is the Elisabeth-Anna-Palais, adjacent to the Schlossgarten Oldenburg, the main public park in Oldenburg. History In 1607‚Äì1667, the present palace served as the residence of Anthony G√ºnther, Count of Oldenburg (1583‚Äì1667). After his death without a legitimate heir, most of his land fell into the hands of the Danish royal family for more than a hundred years. During this period, a Danish governor resided in the castle. In 1773, the Holstein-Gottorf family took over control of the newly created Duchy of Oldenburg until 1860. In that year, Grand Duke Nikolas Peter Friedrich (1827‚Äì1900) moved to the nearby Prinzenpalais. By 1894, the palace was the residence of the hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich August (1852‚Äì1931). He abdicated as reigning Grand Duke during the November Revolution of 1918, and in 1919‚Äì20 the palace was transformed into the Landesmuseum Oldenburg by the Government of the State of Oldenburg. It was transferred to public ownership in 1923.

Early life Gonz√°lez was born in Cayey, Puerto Rico in 1954 but moved with her family to central New York when she was three years old. Her migrant farmworker parents moved frequently (Gonz√°lez estimates that she attended thirteen elementary schools), but by the time she reached middle school, Gonz√°lez‚Äôs father had found work in construction and the family settled permanently in Syracuse. She attended Corcoran High School in Syracuse. The first member of her family to receive a high school diploma, Gonzalez received her B.A. in political science and Latin American studies from Binghamton University through the HEOP program and an MPA from Syracuse University. Career Gonz√°lez stayed at Binghamton for eight years as a counselor in the HEOP program. In 1984, Gonz√°lez began working for Syracuse University as an academic advisor. She held various positions in the university‚Äôs administration including interim dean of University College (2004‚Äì2007) and dean of the University College (2007‚Äì2016). =Community service and politics= Gonz√°lez became active in community and Latino politics in the 1980s; by the early 1990s, education had also become a priority. She participated in local committees and wards and was a member of the Association of Neighbors for Latino Advancement (ANCLA), Spanish Action League, and Latinos Concerned for Latino Advancement. In 1990, Gonz√°lez served on the mayor‚Äôs Latino Task Force and the Minority Affairs Advisory Council for the city of Syracuse. More recently, she co-founded the Onondaga Latino Caucus. In early 1991, Gonz√°lez's service on the mayor's Latino Task Force drew the attention of Syracuse Mayor Thomas Young, who nominated Gonz√°lez to the school board after the board‚Äôs president resigned. The first Hispanic to hold a citywide position, Gonz√°lez was elected to the board later that year, becoming the first Latina elected to a citywide office in Syracuse. Gonz√°lez served as a school board member until 1994. After a hiatus from politics to focus on raising her son, she reentered politics in July 2001 when she was selected to fill the vacant position of Syracuse Common Council president, becoming the first Latina to serve on the Common Council. Gonz√°lez narrowly won a four-year term as council president in November 2001, and was reelected to her second and final term in 2005.

It is not necessarily an alternative to the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) since the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive so both could be true simultaneously. IDH also holds that UFOs are a modern manifestation of a phenomenon that has occurred throughout recorded human history, which in prior ages were ascribed to mythological or supernatural creatures. Theory Although ETH has remained the predominant explanation for UFOs by UFOlogists, some ufologists have abandoned it in favor of IDH. Paranormal researcher Brad Steiger wrote that \\"we are dealing with a multidimensional paraphysical phenomenon that is largely indigenous to planet Earth\\".Steiger, Brad, Blue Book Files Released in Canadian UFO Report, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1977, p. 20 Other UFOlogists, such as John Ankerberg and John Weldon, advocate IDH because it fits the explanation of UFOs as a spiritistic phenomenon. Commenting on the disparity between the ETH and the accounts that people have made of UFO encounters, Ankerberg and Weldon wrote \\"the UFO phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors.\\"John Ankerberg & John Weldon, The Facts on UFO's and Other Supernatural Phenomena, (Eugene, OR: Harvest House Publishers, 1992, pp10 In the book UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse published in 1970, John Keel linked UFOs to folkloric or supernatural concepts such as ghosts and demons. The development of IDH as an alternative to ETH increased in the 1970s and 1980s with the publication of books by Vall√©e and J. Allen Hynek. In 1975, Vall√©e and Hynek advocated the hypothesis in The Edge of Reality: A Progress Report on Unidentified Flying Objects and further, in Vall√©e's 1979 book Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults. Some UFO proponents accepted IDH because the distance between stars makes interstellar travel impractical using conventional means and nobody had demonstrated an antigravity or faster-than-light travel hypothesis that could explain extraterrestrial machines. With IDH, it is unnecessary to explain any propulsion method because the IDH holds that UFOs are not spacecraft, but rather devices that travel between different realities. One advantage of IDH proffered by Hilary Evans is its ability to explain the apparent ability of UFOs to appear and disappear from sight and radar; this is explained as the UFO entering and leaving our dimension (\\"materializing\\" and \\"dematerializing\\"). Moreover, Evans argues that if the other dimension is slightly more advanced than ours, or is our own future, this would explain the UFOs' tendency to represent near future technologies (airships in the 1890s, rockets and supersonic travel in the 1940s, etc.).

The term groups most named current architectural styles and can be used to describe many non-vernacular architectural styles. Irreconcilable architectural practices include Functionalism and Brutalism. Description Polite architecture is characterised by stylistic and romantic features which have been intentionally incorporated by an architect for affectation. A building of polite design is conceived to make a stylistic statement which goes beyond its functional requirements. Its design is deferential to national or international architectural fashions, styles, and conventions; paying little or no regard to the conventional building practices and materials particular to a locality. 'The polite' is also a concept of architectural theory used to differentiate from 'the vernacular'. Architectural theory The term is used by architectural historians to contrast with vernacular architecture, which refers to buildings which are constructed from materials and building conventions particular to their locality. The architectural historian Ronald Brunskill has offered the following definition: > The ultimate in polite architecture will have been designed by a > professional architect or one who has acted as such through some other > title, such as surveyor or master mason; it will have been designed to > follow a national or even an international fashion, style, or set of > conventions, towards an aesthetically satisfying result; and aesthetic > considerations will have dominated the designer's thought rather than > functional demands.Brunskill, 2000, page 27 As a theoretical term, the differences between \\"the polite\\" and \\"the vernacular\\" can be a matter of degree and subjective analysis. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, there are buildings which illustrate vernacular and polite content.Brunskill, 2000, page 28 The growth of polite architecture Although originally only accessible to wealthy individuals and institutions, since the developed world's industrialisation buildings characterised by elements of 'the polite' have become prevalent throughout the building stock of developed countries. The rise in the number of buildings reflecting polite architectural features has been influenced by the expansion of the profession of architecture, the availability of more artistically amenable and often more resilient man-made building materials for most structural and decorative purposes, such as cement render, decorative bricks, plastics, glass and metals, and the availability of transport networks capable of delivering materials produced outside of a building's immediate locality. The growth of these elements in the late 18th and 19th centuries, led to an expansion in the proportion of buildings which are of polite design, which may be as a result of aesthetic architects being demanded by choice or by economic convenience. Its growth has continued in the 20th and 21st centuries however has been nuanced by local policy and aesthetic demands to incorporate facets of architectural revivalism in many styles of architecture.

The story follows Luke, an amnesic who spends the duration of the book learning of his life, and slowly uncovering secrets of a conspiracy to hold America back in the space race. It is set out in both chapters and parts. There are six parts to the book, and an unspecified number of chapters which are titled by the time of day they are set, rather than the more common numbering system. Plot summary In America, 1958 a man wakes up in a men's room with no recollection of his past. His clothing, associates and surroundings suggest to him that he is an alcoholic derelict, however his behaviour, intelligence, morals and instinct lead him to investigate and research his past. He establishes (by the simple method of going into a library and pulling books off shelves until he finds one that he understands,) that he is in fact Dr Lucas - a rocket scientist, and well known in his field. He further establishes that he is directly responsible for the design of a rocket due to be launched by America in an attempt to match the Soviet Sputnik, and bolster America's entry into what would become the Space Race. Several people from his past both help and hinder his progress, and the implication is made that he himself was a Soviet spy, and had his memory erased instead of being killed - although this theory is made suspect when his old college friend reveals that he himself was once a Soviet spy and subsequently turned (but not entirely forgiven) by Lucas. The actual spies (and saboteur) are revealed to be both his wife and another close friend, who plan on using the rocket's self-destruct mechanism to destroy the rocket as it is launched, either removing America from the Space Race, or putting their progress back so far that the Soviets will be hard to catch. The plot is foiled with seconds to spare, and his wife apparently commits suicide rather than being caught by driving her car into the sea. The second saboteur is shot and killed in a gun battle prior to Lucas' wife's suicide.

Georgia imported also many slaves from the Congo-Angola region. Many of the Bakongo slaves who arrived in the United States in the 18th century were captured and sold as slaves by African kings to other tribes or enemies during several civil wars. Some of the people sold from Kongo to the United States were trained soldiers. In 1739, there was an uprising in South Carolina, where possibly 40% of the slaves were Angolan. This uprising, known as the Stono Rebellion, was led by an Angolan named Jemmy, who led a group of 20 Angolan slaves, probably Bakongos and described as Catholic. The slaves mutinied and killed at least 20 white settlers and several children. They then marched to Charlestown, where the uprising was harshly repressed. Forty of the slaves in the revolt (some Angolans) were decapitated and their heads strung on sticks to serve as a warning to others. This episode precipitated legislation banning the importation of slaves. The ban was aimed at solving two serious problems: the inhumanity toward the black slaves and the fact the country had more blacks than whites. Later, some 300 former Angolan slaves founded their own community in the Braden River delta, near what is now downtown Bradenton, Florida. They gave it the name of Angola, in honor of the homeland of many of them, and tried to live as free men. However, this Angola was destroyed in 1821. Rich hunters and slaveholders hired 200 mercenaries and captured 300 black people and burned their houses. It is believed, however, that some Angolans fled in rafts and successfully reached Andros Island in The Bahamas, where their lives were established . = Recent emigration = Large-scale Angolan immigration to the United States began in the 1970s, fleeing regional wars in their country. Initially, most Angolans refugees emigrated to France, Belgium, and Portugal ‚Äì the country to which Angola belonged in colonial times and with which they share a language. But in the 1980s, European Economic Community restrictions on immigration forced many of them to emigrate to other countries, such as the United States. Before that, only 1,200 Angolans had emigrated to the US. Between 1980 and 1989, 1,170 Angolans entered the US; between 1990 and 2000, 1,995 more arrived. 4,365 Angolans were registered as living in the United States in 2000.lusotopia: Emigra√ß√£o Angolana (In Portuguese: Angolan Emigration). They settled primarily in Philadelphia, St. Louis, Phoenix, and Chicago. There are also some Angolans in Brockton, Massachusetts, attracted to the area by the presence of the established, Portuguese-speaking Cape Verdean community. In 1992, leaders of the Angolan communities of these cities formed the Angolan Community in the USA (ACUSA). The Chicago branch has aided new immigrants.  Demography  Currently, most Americans who are descendants of Angolan immigrants to the United States speak Portuguese and English. Despite the large family sizes in Angola, most Angolan immigrants in United States are single men or small family groups. In cities such as Chicago, Angolan communities tend to celebrate Angolan festivals, listen to Angolan music or read newspapers about events that occur in Angola. The main communities are concentrated in Philadelphia, St. Louis, Phoenix and Chicago. Meanwhile, the states with the largest Angolan-American communities are Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New Jersey. Although according to estimates by 2000 there were only 1,642 people of Angolan origin in the U.S., according to the same census for that year, 4,365 Angolan-born people lived in the United States, of whom 1,885 were white, 1,635 black, 15 of Asian race, 620 racially mixed and another 210 of unspecified race.

Biography  Milev was born in Mokreni (today Variko, Florina regional unit, Greece), a Bulgarian-populated village in Macedonia, then in the Ottoman Empire. He finished the Bulgarian primary school in his birthplace and went with his father to Cairo, Egypt, where he lived for a period. He continued his education in Galatasaray High School in Istanbul. In 1902, he was a teacher in Istanbul and worked for Simeon Radev's newspaper Evening Mail. He then studied at the Sofia University, from where he graduated in history (1903‚Äì1909). With the recommendations of Professor Vasil Zlatarski and with a Marin Drinov scholarship, Milev specialized history in Vienna, Florence and Rome from 1910 to 1912. During the Balkan Wars, Milev was an interpreter at the headquarters of the Second Bulgarian Army. After the Balkan Wars, he became an associate professor at the Department of Bulgarian History and History of the Balkan Nations at Sofia University (1915‚Äì1922). In 1918 Milev, became director of the press at the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was among the founders of the political party People's Accord (Naroden sgovor) in 1921. In 1922, he worked as the head of the daily newspaper Slovo (\\"Speech\\"). As President of the Association of the Journalists in Sofia, he protected the freedom of speech and press and, as grandmaster of the Zora freemason's lodge, he advocated for the cause of the Macedonian Bulgarians and an autonomous Macedonia. Regardless of his negative attitude towards the policy of the Bulgarian Premier Aleksandar Stamboliyski, Milev was included in the Bulgarian delegation at the Conference of Lausanne in 1922.

In 1925 Milev was selected as the representative of Bulgaria in the United States, but was killed days before his departure. The decision to kill Milev was taken by a group of Macedonian figures around Dimitar Vlahov. It is believed that Milev was one of the main ideological opponents to the Comintern and its supporters in the Macedonian movement.

Early life He was the son of Irish Quaker immigrants who had come to America about five years prior to his birth. His father was engaged in the shipping business until 1766 when he went into hardware, but died later the same year. A few years later, the family moved to Bucks County, Pennsylvania. When thirteen years old, Eddy was apprenticed to learn the tanning business in Burlington, New Jersey but remained there only two years. Business career In September 1779, Eddy removed to New York City, and became a merchant, dealing mostly in imported goods which were shipped from England and Ireland by his brother Charles. In 1781, he earned a large amount by the remittance of money from the British headquarters in New York. In 1782, Eddy married Hannah Hartshorne at New York City. Afterward, he returned to Philadelphia and formed a partnership with his brother George. In the wake of the commercial crisis in the middle of the 1780s, he and his brothers George and Charles went bankrupt. He removed to New York City again, and became the first insurance broker there, and later an underwriter, speculating in public funds. He became thus a director of the Mutual Insurance Company, and the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company. In 1803, he was one of the founders of the New York Savings Bank.The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Thomas Eddy Political career Eddy had been engaged in charitable work, was elected a governor of the New York Hospital in 1793, and became interested in the reform of the penal laws. He lobbied for inmate labor and solitary confinement in place of other forms of punishment such as hanging.. In 1796, Eddy helped State Senators Philip Schuyler and Ambrose Spencer to draft a bill which established the penitentiary system. The bill was passed and Eddy was appointed to the Commission which put it in practice. He was chosen to oversee the construction of the first State Prison, located in Greenwich Village, better known as the old \\"Newgate\\" Prison, and became its first Director, from 1797 to 1801. He also urged the State Legislature to build facilities for the mentally ill. Erie Canal In 1797, Eddy was appointed Treasurer of the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company, which had been established in 1792 with the purpose of developing a navigable route up the Mohawk River to Lake Ontario. When he found his company in financial trouble, he drew upon the idea first proposed by Joshua Forman (member of the New York State Assembly from Onondaga County in 1808) of building a canal, rather than trying to navigate the rivers. He turned to his friend Jonas Platt, then a State Senator and leader of the Federalists in New York, and the two of them decided to propose the creation of a Commission to explore two possible routes of a canal ‚Äì either to Lake Ontario or to Lake Erie. They would report their findings to the New York State Legislature after their expedition to the west. On March 13, 1810, Platt presented his project for a bipartisan Canal Commission to the State Legislature, and received overwhelming support, and Eddy was appointed one of the Commissioners. The Erie Canal was eventually opened in 1825.

The inauguration was held nearly two months after the beginning of the first four-year term of George Washington as President. Chancellor of New York Robert Livingston administered the presidential oath of office. With this inauguration, the executive branch of the United States government officially began operations under the new frame of government established by the 1787 Constitution. The inauguration of John Adams as Vice President was on April 21, 1789, when he assumed his duties as presiding officer of the United States Senate. Start of the first Presidential term The first presidential term started on March 4, 1789, the date set by the Congress of the Confederation for the beginning of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, logistical delays prevented the actual start of the operations of the Executive Branch on that day. On that date, the House of Representatives and the Senate convened for the first time, but both adjourned due to lack of a quorum. As a result, the Presidential Electoral Votes could not be counted or certified. On April 1, the House convened with a quorum present for the first time, and the representatives began their work, with the election of Frederick Muhlenberg as its Speaker. The Senate first achieved a quorum on April 6, and elected John Langdon as its president pro tempore. That same day, the House and Senate met in joint session and the electoral votes were counted. Washington and Adams were certified as having been elected president and vice president respectively. It was 5 p.m. at Mount Vernon on April 14, 1789, when Washington received official notification that he had been unanimously selected by the Electoral College to be the nation's first president. The letter had been sent by Senator John Langdon of New Hampshire, the first president pro tempore of the United States Senate, who had presided over the counting of the electoral votes. Washington replied immediately, and set off in the morning two days later, accompanied by David Humphreys and a Mr. Thomson, who was the Messenger appointed by the Senate, that delivered to General Washington the letter containing the news of his election. =Washington's Journey to New York= On his way to New York City, Washington received triumphal welcomes in almost every town he passed through. These included Alexandria, Georgetown, Maryland (now part of Washington D.C.), Baltimore and Havre de Grace. One of the places he spent the night was Spurrier's Tavern in Baltimore. Just after noon on April 20, Washington arrived to an elaborate welcome at Gray's Ferry in Philadelphia. He left early the next morning for another welcome awaiting him in Trenton. On April 23 he took a small barge with 13 pilots through the Kill Van Kull tidal strait into the Upper New York Bay, and from there the city. A variety of boats surrounded him during the voyage, and Washington's approach was greeted by a series of cannon fire, first a thirteen gun salute by the Spanish warship Galveston, then by the North Carolina, and finally by other artillery. Thousands had gathered on the waterfront to see him arrive. Washington landed at Murray's Wharf (at the foot of Wall Street), where he was greeted by New York Governor George Clinton as well as other congressmen and citizens. A plaque now marks the landing site. They proceeded through the streets to what would be Washington's new official residence, 3 Cherry Street. Inauguration Federal Hall, New York City, site of George Washington's first inauguration, April 30, 1789. Since nearly first light on April 30, 1789, a crowd of people had begun to gather around Washington's home, and at noon they made their way to Federal Hall by way of Queen Street and Great Dock (both now Pearl Street) and Broad Street. Washington dressed in an American- made dark brown suit with white silk stockings and silver shoe buckles; he also wore a steel-hilted sword and dark red overcoat. Upon his arrival at Federal Hall, then the nation's capitol and the site where the 1st United States Congress met, Washington was formally introduced to the House and Senate, after which Vice President John Adams announced it was time for the inauguration (Adams had already assumed the office of Vice President on April 21, when he began presiding over the Senate sessions). Washington moved to the second-floor balcony. Chancellor of New York Robert Livingston, who had served on the Committee of Five which had drafted the Declaration of Independence, administered the presidential oath of office in view of throngs of people gathered on the streets. The Bible used in the ceremony was from St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M., and due to haste, it was opened at random to Genesis 49:13 (\\"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon\\"). Afterwards, Livingston shouted \\"Long live George Washington, President of the United States!\\" http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/ampage?collId=llsj&fileName;=001/llsj001.db&recNum;=15&itemLink;=r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj0011)):%230010001&linkText;=1 Senate Journal April 30, 1789. to the crowd, which was replied to with cheers and a 13-gun salute. The first inaugural address was subsequently delivered by Washington in the Senate chamber, running 1419 words in length. At this time there were no inaugural balls on the day of the ceremony, though a week later, on May 7, a ball was held in New York City to honor the first President. Three days before George Washington took the oath of office as the first president of the United States, Congress passed the following resolution: Resolved, That after the oath shall have been administered to the President, he, attended by the Vice President and members of the Senate and House of Representatives, shall proceed to St. Paul‚Äôs Chapel, to hear divine service.Annals of Congress, Vol. 1, p. 25, April 27, 1789 Accordingly, the Right Rev. Samuel Provoost (1742‚Äì1815), newly appointed chaplain of the United States Senate and first Episcopal bishop of New York, officiated at a service in St. Paul's Chapel on April 30, 1789, immediately following Washington‚Äôs inauguration, with the newly inaugurated President and members of Congress present.

A Southern Unionist, he fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War, commanding units at Mill Springs, Stones River, Chickamauga, Franklin, Nashville, Bentonville, and in the Knoxville and Atlanta campaigns. He had achieved the rank of Brevet Major General by the time he was mustered out in early 1866. After the war, Cooper commanded the Tennessee State Guard, a state militia organized by Governor William G. Brownlow to quell postwar violence across Tennessee. He served as an internal revenue agent during the 1870s before moving to Kansas, where he spent the final decades of his life. Early life Cooper was born on a farm in Whitley County, Kentucky, near Cumberland Falls, on November 25, 1823. He was the son of John Cooper, a War of 1812 veteran, and Hester (Sage) Cooper. He and his parents moved to Campbell County, Tennessee, the following year, where they settled on a farm along Cove Creek, south of Jacksboro. Growing up in Campbell County, Cooper became a deacon in the Longfield Baptist Church in 1839, and married Mary J. Hutson in April 1846.Bishop, p. 64.Temple, p. 101. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Cooper enlisted as a private in the 4th Tennessee Infantry in September 1847. He remained with this unit until he was mustered out in August 1848, having spent several months in Mexico City. After the war ended he returned to Campbell County, and was involved in farming.Warner (1964), p. 91. While not a major landholder, he nevertheless saw a threefold increase in his personal estate from 1850 to 1860.Bishop, p. 65. Cooper became more politically active during the secession crisis that preceded the Civil War. A Whig, he supported Constitutional Union candidate John Bell in the 1860 presidential election. He attended both the Knoxville and Greeneville sessions of the East Tennessee Convention, which sought to create a new Union-aligned state in East Tennessee. He represented Campbell County on the Convention's powerful business committee at the Greeneville session. He initially supported a set of resolutions submitted by T.A.R. Nelson that called for violent measures to be taken if the Convention's demands were not met, but gradually came to favor a more moderate set of resolutions offered by Knoxville attorney Oliver Perry Temple.Temple, p. 102. Civil War service While in Greeneville, Cooper made a secret pact with several other East Tennessee Convention delegates, including Richard M. Edwards and Robert K. Byrd, to return to their respective homes and begin recruiting and drilling men to defend the region against a Confederate invasion.Temple, p. 104. Returning to Campbell County, Cooper began rallying Unionists, farming by day, and recruiting at night. By August, he had recruited over 500 men. He drilled the recruits at King Field, a remote highland meadow near Jacksboro.Temple, p. 105. Upon the approach of Confederate forces, Cooper and his new unit fled to Kentucky. He was mustered in as captain of Company A of the 1st Tennessee Infantry on August 4, 1861. He took part in operations around Cumberland Gap, and was present at the Battle of Mills Springs in January 1862. In March of the same year, Cooper's company attacked and broke through Confederate defenses at Big Creek Gap, a key mountain pass in northern Campbell County. In May 1862, Cooper was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 6th Tennessee Infantry, which he organized and recruited. In July 1862, Cooper and his regiment attacked a Confederate force at Wallace's Crossroads (near modern Andersonville, Tennessee), killing five soldiers and capturing several others. Cooper retreated with Union forces northward to the Ohio River in late September 1862, to regroup. In December 1862, he joined Union forces in Nashville. During the Battle of Stones River in early January 1863, Cooper and the 6th accompanied a supply train from Nashville to the front lines in Murfreesboro, and repulsed an attempt by Joseph Wheeler to capture the supplies.Temple, p. 106. Cooper skirmished with Confederate forces on Lookout Mountain during the latter phases of the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863, and took part in the Knoxville Campaign in late 1863 and early 1864. In April 1864, Cooper commanded the 3rd brigade at the Battle of Resaca in Georgia, where his unit suffered a 30% casualty rate. He afterward took part in General William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign.Bishop, p. 105. Battle of Nashville Cooper was promoted to brigadier general on July 30, 1864. He commanded a brigade of the 2nd Division of the XXIII Corps from June 4, 1864. At the Battle of Utoy Creek he led two brigades in a charge and flanking movement of Armstrongs Dismounted Cavalry Brigade of Bates Division along the Sandtown Road, on August 6, 1864. He temporarily obtained divisional command following the Battle of Jonesborough.Warner (1964), p. 92. Cooper was again in command of his brigade, and intermittently commanded the 2nd Division during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Marching to relieve Nashville, which was threatened by General John B. Hood in November 1864, Cooper was forced to proceed beyond the city to Clarksville to avoid capture, and returned to the city after resting for a day, marching over in six days. Upon reaching the front, he helped thwart Hood's assault on the city, charging and capturing two artillery pieces and a number of Confederate soldiers. In January 1865, Cooper led the 2nd Division to North Carolina, where he took part in the Battle of Bentonville. In March 1865, he was appointed a brevet major general in the Union Army for his service throughout the war, in particular for his actions at Nashville.Warner (1964), p. 92.Bishop, p. 66. He was mustered out on January 15, 1866.Eicher, p. 184. Tennessee State Guard After the war, Cooper moved to Knox County and engaged in politics. When a rift developed between Governor William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow and President Andrew Johnson over how to deal with freedmen and former Confederates, Cooper supported Brownlow, who sought to extend civil rights to former slaves and disfranchise ex-Confederates. Cooper publicly denounced Johnson, and was described by one newspaper as Johnson's \\"most violent enemy.\\"Severance, p. 57. In August 1865, Cooper ran for the 2nd district seat in Congress. Though he placed second, ahead of fellow Union officer Robert K. Byrd and future congressman Leonidas C. Houk, he was still well behind the winner, Horace Maynard.\\"Vote of the Knoxville District,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 13 September 1865, p. 2. He rejected subsequent calls to run for the state legislature.Severance, p. 58. Brownlow's hardline stance toward former Confederates created widespread unrest among Rebel vigilante groups across the state, most notably the Ku Klux Klan. Brownlow initially sought the assistance of the federal army, but its commanders were reluctant to get involved in what was deemed a civil matter. To quell the rising violence and maintain order in the August 1867 elections, Brownlow and his allies in the state legislature created a new state militia, known as the Tennessee State Guard, in January 1867. Brownlow appointed Cooper commander of the State Guard, with the rank of brigadier general, on June 7, 1867.Severance, p. 56. Cooper quickly formalized the Guard's structure, dividing its 1,900 recruits into two regiments, each containing an equal number of companies from each of the state's three grand divisions. Many of the company captains were former Union Army officers. The Guard also included a number of black soldiers. Along with formalizing the Guard's structure, Cooper also resolved various supply and logistics issues. Twenty-one companies were deployed in troubled spots across the state, mostly in Middle and West Tennessee. One week before the August 1867 elections, Cooper declared the Guard ready.Severance, p. 59. In the election, Brownlow easily defeated his Conservative opponent, Emerson Etheridge. Conservatives criticized the State Guard for using ruthless tactics to harass voters, and appealed to President Andrew Johnson for help.Severance, p. 80. Conservative newspapers assailed the State Guard as tyrannical, and Guardsmen were often portrayed as overly aggressive and undisciplined.Severance, pp. 85, 154. Nashville mayor William Matt Brown, who had clashed with Cooper in July 1867, was one of the Guard's most vehement critics. Brown declared that the State Guard did not have the authority to police municipal elections, and formed a special police force to oversee the city's local elections in September 1867. In response, Cooper dispatched a battalion of State Guardsmen to the city, and Brown eventually backed down.Severance, pp. 122, 161. By the end of September, most Guardsmen had been mustered out, and the remaining companies consolidated into a \\"special command\\" to continue to pursue vigilantes. Cooper relinquished command on October 11, declaring the Klan threat contained.Severance, pp. 157, 168. Toward the end of his gubernatorial tenure in January 1869, Brownlow, citing another rise in Klan violence, reactivated the State Guard, and reappointed Cooper its commander. Using powers granted him earlier that year by the state legislature, Brownlow declared martial law in nine Tennessee counties, and ordered the Guard deployed to these counties. Cooper declared that any Klansmen captured would be hanged, and warned local authorities in non-affected counties that martial law would be imposed on them, as well, if they did not aid in the fight against the Klan.Severance, pp. 195‚Äì198. In late February 1869, however, Brownlow's successor, Dewitt Clinton Senter, softened the martial law decree, and afterward began demobilizing the Guard.Severance, pp. 209, 218. Cooper relinquished command for the second time on May 22, 1869.Severance, p. 222. Historians in the late 19th century were often critical of the State Guard, describing it as an instrument of oppression, and going so far as to compare it to Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army of 17th- century England. However, historian Ben H. Severance argues the State Guard was actually a \\"responsible defender of both the Reconstruction process and the civil rights of the freedmen.\\"Severance, p. 223. He suggests that in spite of sporadic reports of drunkenness and violence, the Guard was unusually well- behaved, and cites Cooper's leadership and emphasis on discipline as the reason for this.Severance, pp. 118, 223. Later life Cooper, photographed in 1906 In October 1867, Cooper was among the candidates considered for the soon-to-be-vacant U.S. Senate seat of David T. Patterson, but the legislature elected Brownlow.Severance, p. 286. In May 1869, Cooper attended the contentious state Republican Party convention, which was wrought with consistent infighting between supporters of Senter and supporters of William B. Stokes. When Alfred Cate, Roderick R. Butler, and Thomas H. Pearne scuffled over the chairman's gavel, a frustrated Cooper restored control and convinced the delegates to adjourn for the day in order to cool off. He told the delegates, \\"Go, and drink less bad whiskey and you will be more capable of doing business.\\"Hardy, William Edward, \\"'Fare well to all Radicals': Redeeming Tennessee, 1869‚Äì1870,\\" PhD diss., University of Tennessee, 2013, p. 120. Later that year, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Cooper internal revenue collector for the Knoxville District. He held this position until 1879, when he was removed following an intraparty power struggle.Severance, p. 303. In 1880, Cooper moved to Stafford County, Kansas, where he became involved in farming, and supported local Republican Party candidates.\\"General Cooper Dead,\\" Barton County Democrat, 27 May 2010, p. 1. Shortly after his arrival in Stafford County, he was appointed moderator of the South Central Baptist Association of Kansas, a position he held until 1909. On April 3, 1891, he was injured in the city of Larned in Pawnee County when he was struck by a railroad car, though he recovered.Welsh, p. 76. He died at his home near St. John on May 20, 1910. His body was returned to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was interred in the Knoxville National Cemetery. See also *Samuel P. Carter *James G.

It may vary from above the ears to below the chin. If a man's hair reaches the chin, it may not be considered short. For a woman, however, short varies from close-cropped to just above the shoulders. Different styles of short hair include the bob cut, the crop and the pixie cut. Maintenance Short hair is easier to care for than long hair. For this reason, many women cut their hair short to save time and the effort of maintaining it. Men For men in Europe or European-settled areas, having short hair is now generally the norm, despite long hair or wigs having been fashionable at various times in the past (including ancient Sparta, the 18th century, and the 1970s). In East Asia, the style is in a relativity recent development. Cultures within the Sinosphere generally preserved a tradition of growing out one's hair long without trimming, although it was typically worn tied up. The Qing dynasty required this to be cut into a queue, but it wasn't until the advent of the European colonial empires and the Republic of China that what is normally thought as short hair became popular for men. Women Short hair for women became fashionable in the 1920s. Styles included the bob cut (a blunt cut to the chin or neck and cut evenly all around), the shingle bob (a haircut that was tapered short in the back) and the short crop (cut short in the back and longer hair in front). Women wore longer styles in the 1930s and 1940s, but short hair made a comeback when Audrey Hepburn sported a pixie cut (a very short wispy haircut) in the 1953 film Roman Holiday. Short hair was fairly popular throughout the 60s, but the 70s and 80s favored different hairstyles. It became popular in the 1990s and remains so to this day. There have been other styles, such as the Eton crop (a more extreme take on the short crop), and short layers.

SFC Roberts was awarded a Bronze Star for the design.According to 'U.S. Army Uniform of the Vietnam War\\", by Shelby Stanton, three US Army SF men contributed to the design, testing, and adoption of the STABO harness: Major Robert Stevens, Captain John Knabb, and SFC Roberts. SFC Roberts was not the only one involved in the design, invention and manufacture of the first STABO harness, there was also a Major Robert L. Stevens and Captain John D. H. Knabb. STABO is a combination of letters from each of the three inventors and does not stand for Stabilized Body. The STABO harness/rig was a machine-stitched, skeletonized harness, very similar to that of a standard parachute harness. The harness webbing was made of heavy duty nylon, identical to the type used in the manufacture of parachute harnesses. The STABO rig served two main functions: it was itself an extraction harness and also served as the base for the operator's load bearing equipment in the field. Later versions of the STABO harness were made in small, medium and large sizes. Use To ready a STABO harness for rope extraction, the two leg straps (normally folded and stowed during ground operations (secured by utility tape or rubber bands)) were freed from the back of the harness, routed up between the legs, and each leg strap was then snapped onto a V ring, with one mounted on each lower front waist of the harness. A standard issue LBE pistol belt was laced through the center sections of the rig, and fastened around the operator's waist, which served as the main closure device for the overall rig on the operator. The operator was extracted using a dual rope (or strap) 'Y' design system (one per each STABO rig), lowered by a helicopter. Each strap end typically retained a large carabiner fastener, which was clipped to a large V or D ring permanently attached to each upper shoulder strap of the rig. Once both carabiners were attached to the upper V/D rings on the rig, the operator could then be lifted out vertically by the helicopter. (This extraction method was often referred to informally as the \\"strings\\" method.) The STABO rig was far more secure, safe and comfortable than the McGuire rig, and perhaps most importantly, it allowed the unrestricted use of the operator's hands, to operate any weapons during the frequently 'hot' extractions from a combat landing or pickup zone. Further, the rig was equally effective if an operator was wounded or unconscious. As the STABO rig was used as the base for operator's personal LBE harness, it was worn for the full duration of the combat operation, in which to allow for rapid extraction by the rope (\\"strings\\") method, if a conventional helicopter LZ could not be quickly established (which was frequently experienced in South East Asia, as reconnaissance teams were operating deep in heavily forested enemy territory). The current US Military method for extracting troops using the helicopter rope method is the Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE) system, a direct and close descendant of the STABO rig system that was developed and pioneered in Vietnam/SEA.

He received his name from Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was his godmother.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, biography, and Manners, in the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, Elizabeth, and James, Volume 1, Bensley, 1838, p. 437. He spent his first year at Hampton Court Palace, England. When his father died in 1575, he became the Margrave of Baden-Rodemachern. His guardian, Duke William V of Bavaria, gave him a Catholic upbringing and in 1584 he converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism,Lebensbilder aus Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Kommission f√ºr Geschichtliche Landeskunde in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, 2005, p. 5 (German). as his mother had already done. The strife between Catholics and Protestants divided Edward's family, and on 18 November 1589 he hosted a colloquy in the Town Hall at Baden to discuss the relative claims of Catholicism (represented by Johann Pistorius), Lutheranism (represented by Andre√§ and Jacob Heerbrand), and Calvinism, represented by Schyrius, but it caused only a hardening of viewpoints.Charles Francis Coghlan, The Beauties of Baden-Baden and Its Environs, London: F.

Jahrhundert bis Heute, Gotha: Friedrich Andreas Perthes, 1892, p. 124 (German). after she had borne him a daughter. They ultimately had four children but due in part to his wife's lesser antecedents they were never recognised as his heirs by Ernest Frederick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, who succeeded him.Max Bauer, Die Deutsche Frau in der Vergangenheit, Berlin: Alfred Schall, n.d. [1907], p. 398 (German). In 1587 he visited his relatives in Sweden, and accompanied his cousin Sigismund III Vasa, King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (and also later King of Sweden) to Poland and in 1588 was appointed by him to head the Polish customs and mines. The same year he inherited Baden-Baden, reuniting it with Baden- Rodemachern. However, he treated the Lutherans harshly and squandered the resources of the territory, and his marriage and children were not approved of by his relatives. In 1594 therefore a relative, Ernest Frederick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, took over the whole of Baden-Baden. (Edward's sons were only reinstated in 1622 after the Battle of Wimpfen, when their Catholicism gave them an advantage.Cambridge Modern History, Ed. A.W. Ward, G.W.

The building is configured as a group of laboratory towers with a central service tower. Brick shafts on the periphery hold stairwells and air ducts, producing an effect reminiscent of the ancient Italian towers that Kahn had painted several years earlier. Rather than being supported by a hidden steel frame, the building has a structure of reinforced concrete that is clearly visible and openly depicted as bearing weight. Built with precisely-formed prefabricated concrete elements, the techniques used in its construction advanced the state of the art for reinforced concrete. Despite observable shortcomings, this building helped set new directions for modern architecture with its clear expression of served and servant spaces and its evocation of the architecture of the past. The Richards Laboratories, along with the associated Goddard Laboratories, which were also designed by Kahn and are treated by architectural historians as the second phase of the Richards project, have been designated a National Historic Landmark. History When the University of Pennsylvania decided it needed a new medical research building, the dean of fine arts recommended Louis Kahn, a highly regarded professor of architecture on the faculty there who had been exploring new approaches for modern architecture. Kahn received the commission for the building in 1957, and it was completed in 1960. It was named the Alfred Newton Richards Medical Research Laboratories Building in honor of a noted researcher and former chairman of the Department of Pharmacology. It quickly received widespread acclaim from the architectural community but also criticism from the scientists who occupied it. The Goddard Laboratories, which are connected to the Richard Laboratories, have a similar but heavier appearance. Completed when Kahn was almost 60, this was his first work to achieve international acclaim. In 1961 the Museum of Modern Art sponsored an exhibition devoted exclusively to it, describing it in a brochure as \\"probably the single most consequential building constructed in the United States since the war.\\" In 1962, Vincent Scully, an influential professor of architecture, called it \\"one of the greatest buildings of modern times.\\" The David Goddard Laboratories were also designed by Louis Kahn and were completed in 1965. Although considered to be separate buildings by the university, the Richards and Goddard Laboratories are physically connected and, with similar designs, have the appearance of being a single unit. The Goddard building is generally treated by architectural historians simply as the second phase of the Richards project. It was named in honor of David Rockwell Goddard, a professor of Botany who also served as university provost and who was the main force in planning and raising funds for it. The Richards Medical Research Laboratories and the David Goddard Laboratories were together declared a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009.. They are also contributing properties to the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. Architecture In the Richards building, laboratories are housed in three towers attached in pinwheel formation to a central fourth tower that houses mechanical systems, research animals, stairs and elevators. Each laboratory tower has eight floors, each of which is a square that is entirely free of stairs, elevators and internal support columns. Each tower is supported by eight external columns that are attached to the four edges of each floor at \\"third-point\\" locations, the two points on each side that divide it into three equal parts. That placement resulted in four column-free cantilevered corners on each floor, which Kahn filled with windows. The support structure of these towers consists of pre-stressed concrete elements that were fabricated off-site and assembled on-site with a crane. Outline of aerial view of the Richards Medical Research Laboratories (left) and the associated Goddard Laboratories (right), both designed by Louis Kahn. Attached to the sides of the laboratory towers are large vertical shafts, some of which hold exhaust ducts and some of which hold stairwells. These shafts, the most striking aspect of the building's exterior, are made from cast-in-place concrete and clad with brick. In contrast to the three laboratory towers, which have prominent windows and intricate structures that were assembled from prefabricated elements, the central tower of the Richards building, the one devoted to service functions, has few windows and a structure that is a single unit of cast-in-place concrete. Attached to its wall farthest from the three laboratory towers are four large air intake shafts, each bringing air to one of four conditioning units on the tower's roof from a \\"nostril\\" near the ground, far away from the emissions at the tops of the exhaust shafts. Three of those conditioning units provide fresh air for the three laboratory towers and the fourth serves the central service tower itself. The Goddard building has the same basic design as Richards. Its two laboratory towers and service tower (for stairs, elevators, etc.) are connected in a straight line to the westernmost tower of the Richards building. A research library is located in Goddard's upper floors with reading carrels that cantilever from the building's face. Service tower for Goddard Laboratories Emily Cooperman, a specialist in historic preservation on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, authored the document that nominated the Richards and Goddard buildings together as a National Historic Landmark. In it she says that \\"observers immediately understood them to be a profound statement of American architectural style that provided a potent design alternative to International Modernism, chiefly as it was embodied in the work of Mies van der Rohe (and in particular as it was epitomized by his Seagram Building)\\". This design alternative was provided, she notes, through their clear expression of served and servant spaces, their evocation of the architecture of the past, and their structure of reinforced concrete that is clearly visible and openly depicted as bearing weight, approaches that \\"countered the philosophy of International Modernism of undifferentiated, universal space and volume and of the minimization of the appearance of weight and load through such constructional devices as the glass curtain wall and the predominance of structural steel.\\" According to Thomas Leslie, author of Louis I. Kahn: Building Art, Building Science, \\"[T]he debates that it inspired and the legions of designers who sought to learn from its example made Richards‚Äîfor all its well-documented flaws‚Äîamong the most influential of Kahn's works.\\" =Served and servant spaces= Robert McCarter, author of Louis I. Kahn, says, \\"A breakthrough building for Kahn, this design saw his first clear articulation of the concept of 'servant' and 'served' spaces\\". The served spaces are the laboratories themselves. The servant spaces are the independently structured shafts for ventilation and stairways that are attached to the outside of the laboratory towers and also the two service towers, which house elevators, animal quarters, mechanical systems, and other auxiliary areas. Kahn spoke critically of laboratories that were designed so that numbers on doors along a corridor are the only distinction between the scientists' main work areas and the areas for stairs, animal quarters and other services. By placing service areas in separate structures, Kahn not only honored the services by giving them their own architectural presence but also enhanced the interior of the laboratory towers by removing obstructions from within. This concept has been an acknowledged influence on several younger architects, especially Richard Rogers, who took this idea even farther and designed or co-designed major buildings with service areas fully exposed on the exterior, such as the Lloyd's of London building and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. =Evoking the past= Exhaust shafts at left and middle; stair shaft at right Carter Wiseman, author of Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style, says the perfection of form achieved by Modern architecture at that time had seemingly led the profession to a creative dead end, a situation he summarized by noting that, \\"There was really nowhere to go from the elegantly reductive principles of Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building.\\" Kahn, who up to this point had been an influential professor of architecture but not yet a major architect, had been teaching that part of the problem was that too many architects were turning their backs on the past. With the Richards Medical Research Laboratories Kahn showed a way forward with a design that was clearly in the Modern style and yet evoked images from the past. The building's towers in particular reminded many observers of the centuries-old towers of San Gimignano, Italy, which Kahn had painted several years earlier. Wiseman says, \\"the Richards towers offered the tantalizing possibility that the 'heart' could be restored to the 'mind' of Modern architecture, largely through the acknowledgement that history‚Äîat least in abstracted form‚Äîstill had something to offer.\\" While studying the classic architecture of Italy, Greece and Egypt during a visit in the early 1950s, a few years prior to his work on the Richards Laboratories, Kahn was so moved by the results that had been obtained in the past by thick and massive building materials that he decided to forego the thin and light-weight materials that were most typical of Modern architecture and instead base his work on concrete and masonry. The Richards building, with its structure of concrete, is accordingly reminiscent of the past not only in appearance but also in substance. Moreover, much of it is faced with red brick, a standard building material of earlier times, especially on college campuses, but one that was almost never used in important Modern buildings at that time. =Structure= In contrast to buildings in the style of International Modernism, which typically had structures of relatively light-weight steel frames that were often hidden behind glass walls, the laboratory towers have concrete structures that are clearly visible and openly depicted as bearing weight. The structure was engineered by August Komendant, a pioneer in the use of pre-stressed concrete. This was the first of several outstanding buildings that Kahn and Komendant worked on together, two of which won the prestigious Twenty-five Year Award given by the American Institute of Architects. Entry porch ceiling showing the building's support structure, which is composed of prefabricated concrete elements that were assembled like children's blocks The structure of the Richards building is composed of 1019 pre-stressed concrete columns, beams, trusses and related items that were trucked in from a factory, assembled with a crane like children's blocks, and locked into place with post-tensioning cables running in all three dimensions, something like an old-style toy that is floppy until its parts are pulled together tightly with a string. In line with his belief that structure should be made visible, Kahn exposed these structural parts on the building's exterior and in the laboratory ceilings. For the post-tensioning to be effective, the prefabricated concrete parts had to be precisely dimensioned and perfectly formed. Komendant worked closely with the manufacturer to ensure that outcome, with the result that the largest offset between any two elements in the finished structure was only 1/16 inch (1.6 mm). The Architectural Record noted that the precision achieved seemed more typical of cabinet making than concrete construction. The entryway for the Richards building is in the middle laboratory tower. Kahn left the entire ground floor of that tower open as an entry porch and exposed the structural elements in its ceiling so the public could see how the building was constructed. Particularly interesting are the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor and whose large rectangular openings allow ducts and pipes to be easily routed through the laboratory ceilings. =Shortcomings= Although widely recognized by the architectural community as embodying important new ideas, the Richards Laboratories had significant shortcomings from the viewpoint of the scientists who worked there. Part of the problem was Kahn's lack of experience with the design of research laboratories. Kahn hoped the scientists who were to occupy the new labs would provide him some direction during exploratory meetings, but he noted that they seemed more interested in asking him questions than in giving definite answers to the questions he asked them. Komendant recalled that Kahn's first question to him during this project was, \\"Doctor, what is a medical laboratory? Have you had any experience in this field?\\" Because the building was intended to serve several departments, Kahn found himself having to satisfy several department heads who did not always agree among themselves, and he had to do so without the benefit of a strong overall project leader. Moreover, the university administrators realized very late in the design process that they had not set aside enough money to furnish the new building with the necessary scientific equipment, so they made up for it by making last-minute cuts in the budget for the building itself. Significantly in light of later criticisms about excessive heat and sunlight in the labs, these last-minute cost-cutting changes included a reduction in insulation, the elimination of window blinds and the replacement of insulated glass with regular glass. Excessive sunlight is handled here with shades of various colors, paper taped to windows, and, at the far right, what appears to be the backs of bookshelves placed against windows. The best-known shortcoming is the glare of sunlight in many of the labs. Kahn fervently believed in the importance of natural light and strongly preferred to work by a window himself, \\"refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days.\\" Although he designed the labs to have an abundance of natural light, he was aware of the potential of having too much sunlight and worked to prevent it. The screening material that he planned to use, however, was cut from the budget, and glare has been a persistent issue. The occupants have handled the problem in uncoordinated fashion by taping sheets of paper to the windows, hanging curtains and placing shelves and equipment in front of the windows. A major preoccupation of Kahn's subsequent career was finding ways of avoiding glare by providing natural light indirectly. Another shortcoming stemmed from Kahn's belief that scientists would work better in an open studio setting if given the chance. He designed each floor of the laboratory towers potentially as one large room and trusted that the scientists would see the desirability of keeping it that way to encourage the interchange of ideas. Most scientists disliked that approach, however, preferring privacy and even secrecy, so partitions were put in place on almost all floors. Kahn was so sure that his approach was the right one that he continued to speak of it afterwards as an important aspect of the design. Kahn left the carefully organized pipes and ducts in the ceilings of each floor fully exposed to view, partly as an architectural statement and partly to make it easier to reconfigure laboratory equipment when necessary. Several departments installed dropped ceilings anyway; the microbiology labs, which require strict dust control, were especially in need of them. The partitions and dropped ceilings together interfered with the planned air circulation patterns in the towers, a problem that was not resolved until a renovation in the 1980s. Because of a reduced budget for the Goddard building, Kahn was forced to make some changes to its design that have reduced its interest to architectural historians, who have written much less about it than about the Richards building. Differences between the two buildings are especially noticeable in the cantilevered corners of the laboratory towers, which have a plainer aspect in the Goddard building. In addition, the administration required Kahn to work on the Goddard building in association with an engineering and construction firm, leaving him unable to assert his usual painstaking control over the construction process and resulting in a lower standard of finish detail. Plywood was used to create the forms for poured concrete in the Goddard building, for example, whereas Kahn had used carefully selected planks for that purpose at Richards to create a more interesting concrete finish. As a result, the Goddard building \\"employs a simplified and visually heavier precast structural system\\" than the Richards building and \\"does not possess the same elegant character\\".

The Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been in a state of official schism from one another since the East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054. This schism was caused by historical and language differences, and the ensuing theological differences between the Western and Eastern churches. The main theological differences with the Catholic Church are the papal primacy and the filioque clause. In spirituality, the tenability of neo-Palamism's essence-energy distinction and of the experiential vision of God as attained in theoria and theosis are actively debated. Although the 21st century saw a growth of anti-western sentiments with the rise of neo-Palamism, \\"the future of East‚ÄìWest rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\\".Michael J. Christensen, Jeffery A. Wittung (editors), Partakers of the Divine Nature (Associated University Presses 2007 ), p. 244 Since the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church has generally taken the approach that the schism is primarily ecclesiological in nature, that the doctrinal teachings of the Eastern Orthodox churches are generally sound, and that \\"the vision of the full communion to be sought is that of unity in legitimate diversity\\" as before the division.Orientale lumen, 18 Areas of doctrinal agreement Both churches accept the decisions of the first seven Ecumenical Councils of the undivided Church. These are: There is therefore doctrinal agreement on: Neither Church community subscribes to the Protestant teachings expressed in the five solae, especially regarding the teachings of salvation through faith alone (apart from the individual's merit) or of sola Scriptura (which they understand as excluding important development in doctrinal teachings passed down through sacred tradition). East‚ÄìWest Schism Changes in extent of the Empire ruled from Constantinople. 476 End of the Western Empire; 550 Conquests of Justinian I; 717 Accession of Leo the Isaurian; 867 Accession of Basil I; 1025 Death of Basil II; 1095 Eve of the First Crusade; 1170 Under Manuel I; 1270 Under Michael VIII Palaiologos; 1400 Before the fall of Constantinople The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have been in a state of official schism from one another since the East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054. This schism was caused by historical and language differences, and the ensuing theological differences between the Western and Eastern churches. The Roman Empire permanently withdrew from the City of Rome in 751, thus ending the Byzantine Papacy. The subsequent mutual alienation of the Greek-speaking East and the Latin-speaking West led to increasing ignorance of the theological and ecclesiological developments of each tradition. The Eastern Church and the Western Church used respectively Greek and Latin as its medium of communication. Translations did not always correspond exactly. This also led to misunderstandings. Papal primacy Papal primacy, also known as the \\"primacy of the Bishop of Rome,\\" is an ecclesiastical doctrine concerning the respect and authority that is due to the pope from other bishops and their episcopal sees. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, some understand the primacy of the Bishop of Rome to be merely one of greater honour, regarding him as ' (\\"first among equals\\"), without effective power over other churches. Other Orthodox Christian theologians, however, view primacy as authoritative power: the expression, manifestation and realization in one bishop of the power of all the bishops and of the unity of the Church. The Roman Catholic Church attributes to the primacy of the Pope \\"full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered,\\" with a power that it attributes also to the entire body of the bishops united with the pope. The power that it attributes to the pope's primatial authority has limitations that are official, legal, dogmatic, and practical. In the Ravenna Document, issued in 2007, representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church jointly stated that both East and West accept the fact of the Bishop of Rome's primacy at the universal level, but that differences of understanding exist about how the primacy is to be exercised and about its scriptural and theological foundations. Filioque Differences over this doctrine and the question of papal primacy have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches. The term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the East‚ÄìWest Schism of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides. Also archived as from scoba.us. New York: Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas. =The Filioque clause= (literally \\"and the Son\\") is a Latin term added to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (commonly known as the Nicene Creed), which is absent in the original Greek version. The Latin term ' is translated into the English clause \\"and the Son\\" in that creed: : :who proceeds from the Father . : or in Latin: : :qui ex Patre : =Inclusion and rejection= The ' is included in the form of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed used in most Western Christian churches, first appearing in the 6th century. It was accepted by the popes only in 1014 and is rejected by the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Church of the East. =Consequences= Whether that term ' is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the central Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of the Father's role in the Trinity; for others, denial of what it expresses implies a serious underestimation of the role of the Son in the Trinity. Over time, the term became a symbol of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, although there have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of Maximus the Confessor, who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. =Possible linguistic resolution= In 1995, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (PCPU) pointed out that the ' conundrum may be a problem of language, rather than a problem of theology. The word in Greek indicates a primary cause or an ultimate cause; while the Latin word ' indicates a procession but not from an ultimate cause. The Latin version may be more accurately retranslated into Greek as , rather than . Metropolitan John Zizioulas declared that PCPCU position shows positive signs of reconciliation for the ' issue between the Eastern and Western churches. Transcribed in Neo-Palamism: theoria and hesychasm =Neo-Palamism= The 20th century saw the rise of neo-Palamism, c.q. \\"Neo-Orthodox Movement,\\" in the Eastern Orthodox Churches. According to this point of view, which arose in defense of the Palamite distinction between essence and energia, western theology is dominated by rational philosophy, while Orthodox theology is based on the experiential vision of God and the highest truth. According to neo-Palamism, this is a main division between East and West. Neo-Palamism has its roots in the Hesychast controversy or Palamite controversy (14th century),A. N. Williams, The Ground of Union: Deification in Aquinas and Palamas, An Overview of the Hsychastic Controversy by Archbishop Chrysostomos, English version: Archbishop Chrysostomos, Orthodox and Roman Catholic Relations from the Fourth Crusade to the Hesychastic Controversy (Etna, CA: Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, 2001), pp. 199‚Äí232 in which Gregory Palamas provided a theological justification for the centuries-old Orthodox practice of hesychasm. The hesychast controversy lead to a further distinction between East and West, giving a prominent place to the contemplative practice and theology in the Eastern Orthodox Churches. The publication in 1782 of the Philokalia, which lead to a revival of hesychasm, was accepted in particular by the Slav Orthodox churches. Together with the importance attached to it in the 20th century by the Paris school of Orthodox theology, it has \\"led to hesychasm's becoming definitive for modern Orthodox theology as never before,\\"Andrew Louth in the Oxford Companion to Christian Thought (Oxford University Press 2000 ), p. 88Gerald O'Collins, S.J. and Edward G. Farrugia, S.J., editors, A Concise Dictionary of Theology (Paulist Press 2000 ), article on Hesychasm and that on Neo-Palamism with its Palamite Essence‚Äìenergies distinction. =Rational and mystical theology= According to these modern Eastern Orthodox theologians, western theology depends too much on kataphatic theology. According to Steenberg, Eastern theologians assert that Christianity in essence is apodictic truth, in contrast to the dialectic, dianoia, or rationalised knowledge which is the arrived at truth by way of philosophical speculation.Gregory Palamas: Knowledge, Prayer and Vision. Written by M.C. Steenberg While Thomas Aquinas argued that kataphatic and apophatic theology need to balance each other, Vladimir Lossky argued, based on his reading of Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology. According to Lossky mysticism, c.q. gnosiology, is the expression of dogmatic theology par excellence, while positive theology is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation. According to Lossky, the difference in East and West is due to the Catholic Church's use of pagan metaphysical philosophy, and its outgrowth, scholasticism, rather than the mystical, actual experience of God called theoria, to validate the theological dogmas of Catholic Christianity. Lossky argues that therefore the Eastern Orthodox and Catholics have become \\"different men,\\" stating that \\"Revelation sets an abyss between the truth which it declares and the truths which can be discovered by philosophical speculation.\\" Lossky had a strong influence on 20th century Orthodox theology, and influenced John Romanides, himself also an influential theologian on his own. Romanides saw a strong dichotomy between Orthodox and western views, arguing that the influence of the Franks, and western acceptance of Augustine's theology, is the starting point of western rational theology, and the dichotomy between East and West.Franks, Romans, Feudalism, and Doctrine/Empirical theology versus speculative theology, Father John S. Romanides This same sentiment was also expressed by the early Slavophile movements (19th century) in the works of Ivan Kireevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov. The Slavophiles sought reconciliation with all various forms of Christianity, as can be seen in the works of its most famous proponent Vladimir Solovyov. =Hesychasm= Hesychasm, \\"to keep stillness,\\" is a mystical tradition of contemplative prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which already existed in the fourth century AD with the Desert Fathers. Its aim is theosis, deification obtained through the practice of contemplative prayer,Archbishop Chrysostomos, Orthodox and Roman Catholic Relations from the Fourth Crusade to the Hesychastic Controversy Etna, CA: Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies, 2001), pp. 199‚Äí232 .Orthodox Spirituality by Metropolitan Hierotheos the first stage of theoria, leading to the \\"vision of God\\".The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions by Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos It consists of three stages, namely catharsis, theoria, and completion of deification, c.q. theosis.

Gregory Palamas of Thessaloniki (1296-1359) provided a theological justification for the practice of hesychasm. Palamas stated that there is a distinction between the essence (ousia) and the energies (energeia) of God. While God in his essence is unknowable and indeterminible, the vision of God can be attained when his energy is seen with the eyes as the Uncreated Light. Palamas formulated his ideas on this distinction as part of his defense of the Athonite monastic practice of hesychasmos against the charge of heresy brought by the humanist scholar and theologian Barlaam of Calabria.\\"accusing Gregory Palamas of Messalianism\\" Antonio Carile, Œó ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ œâœÇ Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø ŒüœÅŒ∏ŒøŒ¥œåŒæŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±œÇ -œÄœÅŒøŒøœÄœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒπŒΩŒÆ ŒïœÖœÅœéœÄŒ∑ Thessaloniki 2000, pp. 131‚Äì140, (English translation provided by the Apostoliki Diakonia of the Church of Greece).Notes on the Palamite Controversy and Related Topics by John S. Romanides, The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, Volume VI, Number 2, Winter, 1960‚Äì61. Published by the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Theological School Press, Brookline, Massachusetts. Orthodox theologians generally regard this distinction as a real distinction, and not just a conceptual distinction. Historically, Western Christian thought has tended to reject the essence- energies distinction as real in the case of God, characterizing the view as a heretical introduction of an unacceptable division in the Trinity and suggestive of polytheism.\\"No doubt the leaders of the party held aloof from these vulgar practices of the more ignorant monks, but on the other hand they scattered broadcast perilous theological theories. Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'. Thirty years of incessant controversy and discordant councils ended with a resurrection of polytheism\\" (Simon Vailh√©, \\"Greek Church\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909)John Meyendorff (editor), Gregory Palamas ‚Äì The Triads, p. xi.

Retrieved on 12 September 2014. =Catholic views on Hesychasm= The later 20th century saw a change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas.John Meyendorff (editor),Gregory Palamas - The Triads, p. xi While some Western theologians see the theology of Palamas as introducing an inadmissible division within God, others have incorporated his theology into their own thinking,Kallistos Ware in Oxford Companion to Christian Thought (Oxford University Press 2000 ), p. 186 maintaining that there is no conflict between his teaching and Roman Catholic thought.\\"Several Western scholars contend that the teaching of St. Gregory Palamas himself is compatible with Roman Catholic thought on the matter\\" (Michael J. Christensen, Jeffery A. Wittung (editors), Partakers of the Divine Nature (Associated University Presses 2007 ), p. 243). Sergey S. Horujy states that \\"hesychast studies may provide fresh look at some old interconfessional divisions, disclosing unexpected points of resemblance\\", and Jeffrey D. Finch says that \\"the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\\".J. Christensen, Jeffery A. Wittung (editors), Partakers of the Divine Nature (Associated University Presses 2007 ), p. 244 Pope John Paul II repeatedly emphasized his respect for Eastern theology as an enrichment for the whole Church. While from a Catholic viewpoint there have been tensions concerning some developments of the practice of hesychasm, the Pope said, there is no denying the goodness of the intention that inspired its defence. Future directions Jeffrey D. Finch claims that \\"the future of East‚ÄìWest rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\\". The Catholic Church considers that the differences between Eastern and Western theology are complementary rather than contradictory, as stated in the decree Unitatis redintegratio of the Second Vatican Council, which declared: The Catholic Church's attitude was also expressed by Pope John Paul II in the image of the Church \\"breathing with her two lungs\\".Ut unum sint, 54 He meant that there should be a combination of the more rational, juridical, organization-minded \\"Latin\\" temperament with the intuitive, mystical and contemplative spirit found in the East. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, citing documents of the Second Vatican Council and of Pope Paul VI, states: On 10 July 2007 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published a document,Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church approved by Pope Benedict XVI, that stated that the Eastern churches are separated from Rome (the member churches of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East) and for that very reason \\"lack something in their condition as particular churches\\", and that the division also means that \\"the fullness of universality, which is proper to the Church governed by the Successor of Peter and the Bishops in communion with him, is not fully realised in history.\\"\\"Catholic Church only true church, Vatican says\\" (CBC News 10 July 2007) On 3 July 2019, it was revealed that during a Vatican meeting with Orthodox Archbishop Job of Telmessos, who represented the Orthodox Church's Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, during the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul on 29 June 2019, Pope Francis stated that unity rather than leveling differences should be the goal between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Pope Francis also gave Bartholomew nine bone fragments which were believed to have belonged to St. Peter and which were displayed at a public Mass which was held in the Vatican in November 2013 to celebrate the \\"Year of Faith\\". Despite holding a \\"cordial\\" meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom the Pope has had a history of good relations, on 4 July 2019 tensions between the Vatican and Russian Orthodox churches still remained, with Pope Francis stating that it is unlikely that he will visit Russia unless Putin agrees to not include the Russian Orthodox Church in the visit. Putin also stated to the Pope that he would not invite the Pope to Russia without this condition.https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/07/04/pope-meets-putin-two-leaders- talk-about-ukraine-syria-venezuela/ Pope Francis also hinted that he was willing to support the concerns of Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which has expressed opposition to both Putin's intervention in Ukraine and the Vatican's current relationship with Putin. At the beginning of a two-day Vatican meeting with Ukrainian Greek-Catholic leaders on 5 July 2019, Pope Francis hinted that he supported the Church's concerns in Ukraine and called for greater humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The Pope previously expressed dismay over the Russian Orthodox Church's role in the conflict in Ukraine in early 2019 as well. During the 5 July 2019 meeting, Pope Francis also accused the Russian Orthodox Church of attempting to manipulate \\"other religions\\" in Ukraine as well.

Joseph Boczov or J√≥zsef Boczor, aka Ferenc Wolff (born 3 August 1905, Fels≈ëb√°nya, Hungary d. 21 Feb 1944, Fort Mont-Val√©rien, France), was a chemical engineer, Hungarian Jew, and volunteer fighter for the French liberation army FTP-MOI. In 1942 Boczov founded and led the 4th detachment, called the d√©railleurs, as they specialized in derailing trains. A specialist in explosives, Boczov had participated in military operations during the Spanish Civil War. He was executed in 1944 by the Germans after a show trial in Paris of the Manouchian Group. Early life and education  Boczov was born into a Jewish Hungarian family. He studied science and math, and in college studied chemical engineering. War At the age of 23, Boczov left his home town on foot to fight in Spain for the International Brigades. He spent six months on the roads and in prisons before reaching his goal. While there, he applied his education to explosives warfare. After the defeat of the Spanish republic and refugees' seeking shelter in France, the French interned him and other brothers-at-arms in the camps of Argel√®s and Gurs. Along with many of his compatriots, Boczov discarded his nationality. As a stateless person, he was deported to Germany. Boczov was the leader of the Romanian group in the camp; he organised an escape during their deportation, and during the escape, he was the last to leave. = Second World War = Migrating to Paris, Boczov arrived in the 1930s and became connected with the many other Hungarians there. After the Fall of France, when the first groups of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) were formed, he became chief of the first detachment of FTP-Immigr√©s, composed of Hungaro-Romanians from the region. He organized the first grenade attack on the train station at Belleville, where large quantities of goods were stored in the depots. Boczov's detachment specialized in derailing SS and Wehrmacht trains. They first worked with simple tools, but refined their techniques as German surveillance improved. As a chemical engineer, Boczov faced with many challenges, and carried on with ingenuity and initiative. As the underground struggle unfolded to higher and higher levels, Boczov's intelligence and experience earned him the leadership of the 4th detachment, assigned to commit sabotage against the railways used by the German army. From 24 September 1943, Boczov saw he was being followed by the Brigades Sp√©ciales n¬∞ 2 of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux, so went into hiding. He used various addresses in Paris: 85, rue de Turbigo; 1bis, rue Lanneau; and 9, rue Caillaux. On 21 October 1943, Boczov, L√©on Goldberg and four other fighters left on a mission to stop a German convoy on the Paris ‚Äì Troyes line at Grandpuits near Mormant. They successfully derailed the train that night, but failed to notice they were being followed. In a firefight, three resistance fighters were killed or taken prisoner, and the others got away but were identified. The noose was tightening. Joseph Boczov was arrested on 27 November 1943. Accused of having carried out 20 attacks (which surpassed his successes), he was brought before the military tribunal in February 1944 in a show trial of the Manouchian Group. He was shot at the fort mont Val√©rien on 21 February 1944 with 21 other members of the group. Boczov was one of ten men of the Manouchian Group whose name and photo were featured on the Affiche rouge German propaganda poster; he was described by the following: :\\"BOCZOV JUIF HONGROIS CHEF D√âRAILLEUR 20 ATTENTATS\\". Before the war, Boczov worked as a carpenter and lived in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

The mission would have comprised at least two independent elements, NASA's Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) and ESA's Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), to perform coordinated studies of the Jovian system. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Roscosmos (Russian Space Agency) had expressed their interest in contributing to EJSM-Laplace, although no deals had been finalized. JEO was estimated to cost US$4.7 billion,Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013‚Äì2022 (2011) (page 365) while ESA would spend US$1.0 billion (‚Ç¨710 million) on JGO. In April 2011, European Space Agency (ESA) stated that it seemed unlikely that a joint US‚ÄìEuropean mission will happen in the early 2020s given NASA's budget, so ESA continued with its initiative, called the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) that will be based on the JGO design. Selection of JUICE for the L1 launch slot of ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme was announced on 2 May 2012. Later, in June 2015, NASA approved the Europa Clipper and it entered the formulation stage,Howell, Elizabeth (20 June 2015). \\"NASA's Europa Mission Approved for Next Development Stage\\" Space.com. Retrieved 21 June 2015 with an expected launch between 2022-2025.  Origins  In February 2008, NASA and ESA began joint investigations into sending a probe to study the icy satellites of the outer Solar System under the title Outer Planet Flagship Mission.Outer Planet Flagship Mission Two primary candidate missions were considered under the study: EJSM and Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM), also known under the ESA designation TandEM. In February 2009, it was announced that NASA/ESA had given EJSM priority ahead of the TSSM.NASA and ESA Prioritize Outer Planet MissionsRincon, Paul Jupiter in space agencies' sights, BBC News (18 February 2009) The ESA contribution still faced funding competition from two other missions, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the International X-ray Observatory (IXO), which is why NASA kept a contingency plan of sending its part of the mission as a stand-alone project.  Mission architecture  A map showing all the nations which are either currently part of (red) or interested in becoming a part of (brown) the EJSM. The most distinctive feature of the EJSM/Laplace-study, was the proposed collaboration with multiple orbiters and landers: * NASA: Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), proposed to study Europa and Io. * ESA: Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), proposed to study Ganymede and Callisto * JAXA: Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter (JMO), proposed to study Jupiter's magnetosphere. * JAXA: Jupiter and Trojan Asteroid Explorer (JTAX), proposed to study a Jupiter trojan. The baseline EJSM architecture consisted of JEO and JGO, which were proposed to be launched in 2020 and explore the Jupiter System before settling into orbit around Europa and Ganymede, respectively. The JEO and JGO were separate and independent spacecraft developed, launched and operated by their respective organizations to work together. Their launch dates and interplanetary trajectories were not to be dependent on each other, but would have been synergistic. = Goal = The goal was to determine whether the Jupiter system harbors habitable environments, while focusing on Europa and Ganymede. The main science objectives supporting this goal were: * Characterize sub-surface oceans * Characterize the ice shells and any subsurface water * Characterize the deep internal structure for Ganymede and the intrinsic magnetic field * Compare the exospheres, plasma environments, and magnetospheric interactions. * Determine global surface compositions and chemistry * Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity, and identify and characterize candidate sites for future in situ exploration.

Burrowes is known, however, for having documented the construction of the canal and the landscape of the surrounding area in a series of watercolour paintings, thus creating an important eyewitness record of one of the most important engineering projects of 19th century Canada. Biography Burrowes was born in 1796 in Worcester, England. At the age of 17, he enlisted in the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, and he was posted to Fort Henry in Kingston, Upper Canada in 1815. In 1826, he joined a team assembling in Montreal to build a military canal linking Lake Ontario to the Ottawa River and worked for 20 years - 1826 to 1846 - as a civilian employee on the Rideau Canal project as overseer, surveyor and clerk. Assigned to Bytown (the settlement that later became Ottawa, the capital of Canada), Burrowes served as Assistant Overseer of Works for the Rideau Canal project. He was one of the first persons to take up land and build a home on Wellington Street, the road upon which Canada's Parliament Buildings would be built decades later. In 1829, Burrowes was posted to Kingston Mills, upstream from Kingston, where he served as Clerk of the Works of the Cataraqui section of the Rideau Canal until his retirement in 1846. In 1819, he married Grace Rodgers and till 1826 had 3 sons with her. In 1826, the family moved from Montreal to Bytown. It was in Bytown that their 4th son (namely, John By Burrowes) was born but he died just after 7 months and, was later followed by his mother Grace, who died in 1827. After about 10 years, Thomas considered remarriage and married Margaret Morrision and had 7 childrens (6 girls, 1 boy) with her, all born at Kingston Mills. In retirement, Burrowes worked as a farmer, supplementing his income by serving both as a postmaster and Justice of the Peace in Kingston Mills. Burrowes died in 1866. His home, Maplehurst, still stands. Artwork Throughout his career, Burrowes painted watercolours documenting the construction of the canal and the landscape of Upper Canada. His paintings were discovered in 1907 in the attic of one of Burrowes' daughters in Detroit, Michigan, and were donated to the Archives of Ontario in 1948 by Burrowes' grandson. The paintings have been referred to as \\"some of the most famous images in Ontario history\\", constituting \\"one of the most important ever private donations to the Archives of Ontario\\".A Private, Precious Gift, Archives of Ontario, Retrieved 21 January 2008.

It is made from young leaves that are thinly rolled to have a long, twisted appearance that unfurls when brewed. The name Hyson is probably derived from a Cantonese name (), although there are also anecdotal claims that it was named after an English tea merchant, Phillip Hyson. Hyson is graded into the following three categories: Mi Si, Cheng Si and Fu Si. While hyson tea is often thought of as a low-grade or mediocre quality tea, young hyson is considered high quality. It is harvested earlier, \\"before the rains,\\" and has a full-bodied, pungent taste and is golden in color. Young hyson tea is subdivided into Chun Mee (a hard, small, twisted leaf), Foong Mee (a long, large, curly leaf), Saw Mee (a small, non-hard, twisted leaf), and Siftings. It is also sometimes classified as First, Second, and Third Young Hyson. The Chinese name for young hyson is Yu Chin Ch'a and is categorized as the following: Mi Yu, O Yu, I Yu, Ya Yu as well as Si Yu. Brewing methods To brew, use 1 teaspoon per 6 oz cup, use water that is below boiling point, and steep for 2‚Äì3 minutes. Hyson tea has been described as light, warm, smooth, good-bodied, earthy, sunny, and spring-like in flavor. It can be served hot or iced. Milk and sugar are not typically added and are thought to diminish the flavor of hyson tea, but cold hyson tea is often garnished with lime or lemon. Historical and literary references Despite often being considered of mediocre quality, hyson tea was highly prized by the 18th century British and tea tax on hyson tea was higher than for other teas. During the Boston Tea Party hyson tea represented 70 of the more than three hundred chests of tea that were destroyed. Hyson tea is referenced in the first stanza of \\"Xenophanes\\" by Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1847: \\"By fate, not option, frugal Nature gave One scent to hyson and to wall-flower, One sound to pine-groves and to waterfalls, One aspect to the desert and the lake.\\" The English essayist Charles Lamb mentions Hyson tea in his essay \\"Old China\\", which appears in the collection Essays of Elia (Last Essays of Elia, published 1835): \\"I was pointing out to my cousin last evening, over our Hyson (which we are old fashioned enough to drink unmixed still of an afternoon) some of these speciosa miracula upon a set of extra-ordinary old blue china\\".

A =Acererak= Acererak Mentzer, Frank. \\"Ay pronunseeAY shun gyd\\" Dragon #93 (TSR, 1985) was a powerful wizard who became a lich, and later a demilich. Publication history Acererak first appears in the original Tomb of Horrors adventure (1978) by Gary Gygax as the main adversary. One of the areas in the Tomb is a \\"Chapel of Evil\\", described as \\"obviously some form of temple area - there are scenes of normal life painted on the walls, but the people have rotting flesh, skeletal hands, worms eating them, etc.\\"Gygax, Gary. Tomb of Horrors (TSR, 1978) The adventure described him as \\"a human magic-user/cleric of surpassing evil\\" who took the steps necessary to preserve his life force as the lich, Acererak.\\" The boxed set adventure Return to the Tomb of Horrors (1998) by Bruce Cordell included a small booklet titled \\"The Journal of the Tomb\\", which notes that the character Desatysso discovered that Acererak \\"owed much of his power\\" to Tenebrous.Cordell, Bruce R.. Return to the Tomb of Horrors. Renton, WA: TSR, 1998 Cordell's article \\"Return to the Tomb of Horrors\\" in Dragon #249 (July 1998) mentions that \\"While alive, Acererak built an unholy temple to a now deceased power. When the project neared completion, he slew every worker, excavator, and consecrating priest who had assisted in the temple's construction.\\" The article notes that the result of Acererak's work was the dungeon crawl detailed in the Tomb of Horrors module.Cordell, Bruce. \\"Return to the Tomb of Horrors.\\" Dragon #249. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, July 1998 In the article \\"Open Grave\\" by Bart Carroll and Steve Winters for the \\"D&D; Alumni\\" column in Dragon #371 (January 2009), the authors interviewed Bruce Cordell about the Return to the Tomb of Horrors adventure, where he revealed that he developed the origins of Acererak \\"as a persecuted tiefling child to his development as a wizard and priest of Orcus, to his creation of his tomb that was actually a test to winnow souls\\".Carroll, Bart, and Steve Winters. \\"Open Grave: D&D; Alumni.\\" Wizards of the Coast. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2009 The fourth edition adventure also titled Tomb of Horrors (2010) by Ari Marmell and Scott Fitzgerald Gray mentions in the introduction that \\"Acererak resurfaced as a worshiper of Orcus, using the cult's resources to construct a number of lairs and tombs - the most infamous of which would become known as the Tomb of Horrors. Some sources claim that Acererak was using Orcus's worshipers to complete his own schemes, and that he felt no true loyalty to the demon prince.\\"Marmell, Ari. Tomb of Horrors (Wizards of the Coast, 2010) The introduction goes on to say that \\"Once he attained lichdom, Acererak ceased paying homage to Orcus, lending credence to the notion that his worship had never been more than a means to an end.\\" Acererak is featured in the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Relationships Acererak is the son and ally of the balor Tarnhem, a worshipper of Orcus, and an apprentice of Vecna. In life, he was the enemy of a paladin of Pelor named Pentivel, and the wizard-architect who designs his tomb is called Morghadam. He is revered by a group of wizards known as the Covenenticle of Acererak. The necromancers of Skull City, former followers of Acererak, go on to form a group known as the Votaries of Vecna, making a new home in the Black Spire on the Plane of Shadow. The githyanki necromancer Kastya Zurith-Movya seeks to return the true Acererak to existence as an ally against his people's lich- queen. Home The Tomb of Horrors is long Acererak's home in undeath. As a demilich, he moves to the demiplane of Moil to complete his grand plans. There is a shrine of Acererak, in the form of a five-foot statue of a humanoid skull, on the second layer of Pandemonium. History Acererak the Devourer is described as a cambion, the result of an ancient conjurer summoning a demon, a balor named Tarnhem, far beyond his ability to control. Tarnhem devours the conjurer and takes his human mother by force. Acererak's mother survives her son's birth, but she is killed by a torch-wielding mob ten years later. The boy is rescued by none other than Vecna, the Whispered One, who kills the advisors urging him to kill the child; instead, he takes on the half-demon as an apprentice. Even then, ten-year-old Acererak loathes life, looking forward to becoming undead like his master. During Vecna's siege of Fleeth, the lich is severely wounded and rescued by Acererak. Vecna subsequently promotes the cambion. It is unknown if Acererak is present when Vecna is betrayed by Kas the Bloody-Handed in the fourth century before the Common Year, but at some point, he moves to the Vast Swamp where he constructs a lair for himself, colloquially known as the Tomb of Horrors (and described in an adventure module of the same name). While still alive, Acererak builds a subterranean temple complex in the name of Orcus, burying its architect and all of its workers within. Eventually, Acererak succumbs to the lure of lichcraft, and has himself buried in a labyrinthine tomb, where he commits himself to his studies and, eventually, demilichdom, abandoning his body for the planes beyond. Many adventurers over the years attempt to raid Acererak's tomb, but it is believed that none are able to destroy him, despite some claims. The sequel module Return to the Tomb of Horrors retconned and expanded on the setting. At some point, a group of necromancers settle the area outside the tomb, creating a community of sorts known as Skull City. Acererak's tomb is revealed to be a mere antechamber to the demilich's true dwelling, the lost city of Moil on the border of the Negative Energy Plane, where he had spent thousands of years working on a process to fuse his essence with the plane and gain control over all undead throughout the multiverse. According to the 3rd edition Tome of Magic, Acererak, following his destruction by adventurers completing the Tomb of Horrors, passes on to become a vestige - an ineffable, amoral entity which can be summoned and bound by characters known as Binders. Acererak grants his summoner lich-like powers, including immunity to cold and the ability to speak with the dead.Sernett, Matthew, Dave Noonan, Ari Marmell, and Robert J. Schwalb. Tome of Magic: Pact, Shadow, and Truename Magic (Wizards of the Coast, 2006). According to the adventure \\"Prisoner of the Castle Perilous,\\" Acererak created a simulacrum in the Negative Energy Plane to torment Saint Pentivel, an old foe from his mortal life. This simulacrum eventually transforms itself into a complete being through the aid of an artifact known as the Soul Machine.Greer, Stephen S. \\"Prisoner of the Castle Perilous.\\" Dungeon #153. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2008. Available online: In 4th edition D&D;, Acererak appears in the book Open Grave: Secrets of the Undead as a member of the Undead Hall of Infamy. He also features in a sidequest in the adventure Revenge of the Giants and in the 4th edition remake of Tomb of Horrors as central antagonist. Other Acererak is referenced in a piece of Omega Tech in a Gamma World adventure, Factory of Misfit Omega Tech, specifically the Hunting Knife of Acererak. Its hilt is studded with green and red soul gems. Acererak is also referenced in the novel Hero written by R.A. Salvatore, released in 2016. The reference is made when talking about Malcanthet, the Queen of the Succubi, and the deal she had made with Acererak involving a demonic mirror that traps souls. Acererak uses those souls to feed his undeath. =Aegwareth= Aegwareth is a human shade. A former Elder Hierophant Druid, Aegwareth lived at White Plume Mountain until -800 CY, when he was slain by the wizard Keraptis, who took White Plume mountain for himself. Aegwarth now exists as a shade.Cordell, Bruce R. Return to White Plume Mountain (TSR, 1999)Wilson, Steve. \\"GreyChrondex 4.1\\" (2000).

He is an elderly Baklunish man who walks with a limp, dresses in plain robes, and covers his shaved head with a simple turban. Alhamazad is a good friend of Mordenkainen, whom he has known for over twenty years. He is wary of Drawmij, and holds great antipathy for Warnes Starcoat. Kermin Mind-Bender of the Boneheart once served as Alhamazad's apprentice, but the two are now enemies.Brown, Anne.

In the game, each animal lord is a humanoid being, powerful like a celestial paragon or demon prince, that represents all animals of its chosen type. For example, there is a Mouse Lord, a Lizard Lord, and a Hawk Lord. The most well-known animal lord is Rexfelis, the Cat Lord.Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual II (TSR, 1983).Varney, Allen, ed. Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (TSR, 1994). =Arnd= Arnd, also known as Arnd of Tdon, was a legendary Oeridian hero who lived ages ago, before the Great Migrations. \\"A humble priest from the south,\\" he is famed for establishing the first paladins of Heironeous among the Oeridian tribes. He is also known as a possessor (in more ways than one) of the artifact known as the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd, which he wore while leading a rebellion against the wizard Virtos. It is said that Arnd's spirit still inhabits the armor that bears his name, attempting to aid the poor whenever possible. Arnd is credited with writing Unknown Movements of the Universe, a wizardly spellbook. However, as a priest Arnd is probably not the author of the book in question, unless he was multi-classed. It is possible there was a wizard called Arnd separate from the legendary priest. Arnd of Tdon was named after Don Arndt, a player in the first Greyhawk campaign.Cook, David. Book of Artifacts.

Bellevue, WA: Paizo Publishing, 2007Some notes on Unknown Movements of the Universe, on Canonfire! =Azalin= B =Bigby= Bigby was created by Rob Kuntz as a low-level non-player character evil wizard in the early dungeons of Greyhawk in 1973. Gary Gygax's character, the wizard Mordenkainen, encountered Bigby. The two wizards engaged in combat; Mordenkainen managed to subdue Bigby using a charm spell, and forced Bigby to become his servant. Kuntz ruled that Bigby would be Mordenkainen's servant as long as he remained under the charm spell, but until Gygax, through roleplaying, had won Bigby's loyalty, the evil wizard would remain a non- player character under Kuntz's control. After a long time and several adventures, Mordenkainen managed to convince Bigby to leave his evil ways behind, and Kuntz ruled that it was safe to remove the charm spell, since Bigby had changed from an enemy to a loyal henchman; therefore Gygax could use Bigby as a player character.Gygax: \\"Mordenkainen was adventuring in Rob's dungeon when he surprised a 3rd level magic-user of Evil persuasion. Mordie's charm spell worked on that worthy, whose name turned out to be Bigby. By dint of fellowship, lecturing, mentoring, and sharing with Bigby, he was not only turned from [Evil] to Neutral, but from there to a leaning towards [Good] as he considered his past actions.\\" Q: \\"I heard a story which made it sound like Bigy was an NPC that you charmed and [who] later became your PC.\\" Gygax: \\"Mordenkainen did indeed manage to get the drop on Bigby, [and] charm him. At the time Bigby was a 3rd-level [Evil] dungeon dweller. By word and deen Mordie brought him around from [Evil] to [Neutral], and thus Bigby became his apprentice. I got to roll the stats for that character after Rob [Kuntz] determined he was a loyal henchman of Mordenkainen.\\" For a time after this, Kuntz ruled that all the names of Mordenkainen's future henchmen had to rhyme with Bigby. This resulted in Zigby the dwarf; Rigby the cleric; Sigby Griggbyson the fighter; Bigby's apprentice, Nigby; and Digby, who eventually replaced Bigby as Mordenkainen's new apprentice. Thereafter, Gygax developed Bigby into a powerful wizard second only to Mordenkainen, and eventually Bigby became one of the original members of Gygax's Circle of Eight, a group of adventurers made up of eight of Gygax's own characters. When Gygax wrote TSR's AD&D; Players Handbook, he borrowed Bigby's name to describe a series of \\"hand\\" spells (Bigby's crushing hand, Bigby's grasping hand, etc.). This custom continued on in later versions of D&D;, with over two dozen \\"hand\\" spells eventually ascribed to Bigby. When Gygax was forced out of TSR in 1985, he lost the rights to most of his characters, including Mordenkainen and Bigby.Gygax: \\"Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag.\\" Bigby is one of the famous mages of the Greyhawk setting whose spells were included in the 1988 Greyhawk Adventures hardbound. Bigby was reintroduced as a member of a repurposed Circle of Eight in 1989 in The City of Greyhawk boxed set, where he appeared as part of a cabal of nine wizards who sought to balance the forces of Good and Evil in the world.Niles, Douglas, and Carl Sargent. The City of Greyhawk (TSR, 1989) He also appeared in the adventure Vecna Lives!, where he was temporarily killed by an ancient warlord armed with the hand and eye of Vecna.Cook, David. Vecna Lives! (TSR, 1990) When TSR decided to reboot the World of Greyhawk campaign setting in 1991, Carl Sargent moved the storyline of the setting forward a decade to 585 CY, the year after the end of a continental war called the Greyhawk Wars. By this time, Bigby had returned to life via the agency of a clone spell, and was once again a member of the Circle, now known as the Circle of Five after the deaths of Tenser and Otiluke and the treason and departure of Rary. Bigby remained a potent character in subsequent versions of the Greyhawk setting, which updated the storyline to 591 CY. =Bucknard= Bucknard is a powerful human wizard, and former member of the Circle of Eight. In Dungeon's Age of Worms adventure path, Bucknard is referred to as \\"Balakarde\\". He is described as affable, esteemed, talented and powerful, yet stubborn and headstrong. He has one known sister, Maralee, and is also a former member of the Circle of Eight. In 556 CY, Bucknard's sister and adventuring companion, Maralee, was slain by sons of Kyuss. Bucknard took her death (and seeing her devoured by ghoulish worms) hard. Depressed for years, he emerged from his depression to become one of the most potent wizards of his generation. He had dedicated himself to one overriding task: the destruction of Kyuss. In 571, Bucknard became one of the founding members of the Circle of Eight, as Mordenkainen invited some of the most prominent mages in the Flanaess to join him in a successor organization to the Citadel of Eight. At the height of his powers, Bucknard began deeply obsessing over occult manuscripts relating to the Worm God and his cult. He grew increasingly secluded and paranoid, no longer confiding even with close friends like Tenser. Abruptly resigning from the Circle of Eight in 579 CY, he traveled to Alhaster to research his theory that the Ebon Triad cult had been created there as a front for the cult of Kyuss. Lashonna, the town's most knowledgeable expert in the occult, agreed to meet with him and directed him to the Wormcrawl Fissure, where he was captured by Dragotha. The following year, after months of torture, Bucknard finally died at the hands of his own undead sister, upon Dragotha's orders. Bucknard's soul shattered into three separate ghosts, representing his artistic, scholarly, and vengeful sides, which haunted the Fissure for decades afterwards. In 581, Bucknard's position in the Circle was filled by Jallarzi Sallavarian. Bucknard crafted the magic item Bucknard's Everfull Purse, which is essentially a leather pouch or small bag that refills itself each morning. Each such coinpurse can replicate a different number of coins or gems, depending on which type of bag it is. Bucknard authored Inexplicable Reflections.Brown, Anne.

C =Company of Seven= The Company of Seven is an adventuring group whose members later achieved great fame and power in the world of Oerth. While they were together, the Company of Seven explored many worlds and planes, some previous unknown. Several of the company became demigods or hero-deities, and all of the company have spells and magic items named after them. In 318 CY the Company of Seven discovered the lost Flan citadel of Veralos and returned with a wagon-load of wondrous treasures. It is not known when, how, or why the Company of Seven disbanded. The members of the company were: *Zagig Yragerne, a master wizard who joined (some say formed) this adventuring group early in his career. *Murlynd, a paladin of Heironeous and an insatiably curious artificer. His grasp of technology improved immeasurably when he traveled to Boot Hill on an unknown Material Plane world, and acquired his famous pair of revolvers. *Nolzur, a skilled illusionist and alchemist who applied his magic to his incredible artistic ability, creating pigments and paints that allowed him to perform wonders. *Quaal, a ranger of Flan descent whose interest in useful spells and magic, as opposed to sheer arcane power, served the company in good stead. *Heward, an accomplished bard whose mastery of both song and spell allowed him to channel powerful magic and incredible music through his instruments. *Tasha, a young apprentice wizard with a morbid sense of humor. Though few alive know it, Tasha was actually the legendary archmage known today as Iggwilv, who went on to become the Witch-Queen of Perrenland, mother of Iuz, and sometime lover of the demon prince Graz'zt.Bulmahn, Jason, James Jacobs, and Erik Mona.

The Epic Level Handbook included, as an optional rule, the possibility that he is a quasi-deity. In Gary Gygax's Gord the Rogue series, he is called Rexfelis. The original male Cat Lord first appeared in the original first edition Monster Manual II (1983).Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual II (TSR, 1983) As ruler of all cats since that position has existed, the Cat Lord bears the respect and fealty of felines from house cats to smilodons. Even hybrid beings like weretigers and wereleopards are loyal to him. In the Monstrous Compendium for the Planescape setting, the Cat Lord is presented as female. D =Dragotha= Dragotha is a powerful undead dragon known as a dracolich and a major player in Dungeon's Age of Worms adventure path. Dragotha was formerly a powerful red dragon, the mightiest consort of Tiamat. At some point Dragotha offended his mistress, and was forced to leave Avernus. Making his way to Oerth, Dragotha fell in with Kyuss, and eventually became a dracolich and Kyuss' greatest servant. Dragotha's lair is thought to lie in the Wormcrawl Fissure, near Rift Canyon. More historical information is given in the second edition RPGA Adventurer's Guild Tournament module, Dragotha's Lair (Bruce R. Cordell, 1999, 2001). According to this history, Dragotha was forced into quiescence (inactivity) by Keraptis, the infamous wizard featured in the module White Plume Mountain using a magical device called the Crown of Mortality. According to the third edition White Plume Mountain web enhancement \\"Outside the Mountain is Just as Dangerous as Inside\\" (Robert Wiese, 2006), Dragotha was a black dragon (not a red dragon, as mentioned above) before becoming undead. An expedition to Dragotha's lair is told in the song \\"The Claws of Dragotha\\", which is believed to have been penned sometime in the 5th century CY. Dragotha is mentioned in a pictoral map featured in the White Plume Mountain module: \\"Beyond to the lair of Dragotha, the undead dragon where fabulous riches and hideous death await.\\"Baur, Wolfgang. \\"A Gathering of Winds.\\" Dungeon #129 (Paizo Publishing, 2005).Cordell, Bruce R.

By Ward's own account, the spell originated during a session in Gygax's original Greyhawk campaign during which the players were stranded in a dungeon; Ward's character owned a magical item which would have rescued the party, but had left it in an inn before setting out. Ward remarked to Gygax that wizards should have access to a spell which allowed them to recall any item in their possession to their hand; Gygax promptly devised instant summons, which did exactly that. There has been some confusion over whether Gygax created the name in homage to Ward or Ward's character; though it is known that Ward played a character named Drawmij at one time, some sources claim the name of the wizard he was playing at the time instant summons was created was \\"Bombidell\\", not Drawmij. This leaves two theories as to how the name got started: *Ward named his wizard character \\"Drawmij\\" from the outset, and the spell simply used the name of Ward's character. *Gygax devised the name for publication purposes, as the name \\"Bombidell\\" was derivative of the Tolkien character Tom Bombadil, and Ward subsequently created a new character, Drawmij. Drawmij is 63 years old in 591 CY, although he appears to be a young man in his late twenties or early thirties. His hair is sandy blond and his eyes are so blue that they are nearly purple. He stands six feet tall and weighs 172 pounds. His features possess an undefinable unsettling quality, and more than a few of those who know him have perceived something subtly different about him each time they meet - the shade of his eyes, his height, even the thickness and curl of his hair. Rary calls these his \\"troubling inconsistencies\\". Drawmij wears magical robes of cool colors, favoring elven designs. For the last decade or so, Drawmij has focused on the theories of chronomancy, magic involving the manipulation of time. He has grown increasingly eccentric of late. Drawmij is a member of the Circle of Eight. He has a close connection to Duke Luschan of Gradsul, who may be a relative of his. Drawmij also spends time with the Hierophant Sverdras Meno, a druid of the Old Faith who oversees the Azure Sea. Drawmij has many contacts among the minstrels and bards of Celene, though few in the capital of Enstad admit to knowing him. Drawmij has few known agents, but he knows much more about Keoland and its client states than it seems like he should. Drawmij has an enduring hatred of Jaran Krimeeah, the Mage of the Valley of the Mage, and is forever trying to persuade other members of the Circle of Eight to help him kill the wily archmage once and for all. Jallarzi Sallavarian has suggested to Otto that Drawmij's true enmity is for Tysiln San, Jaran's mistress, though the reasons for this are unknown. Drawmij only grudgingly accepted the addition of Warnes Starcoat and Alhamazed to the Circle of Eight, and argued against the inclusion of Theodain Eriason. Since losing that fight, however, he has treated Theodain's presence with bland acceptance. Drawmij is reputed to live in a cavernous underwater fortress beneath the Azure Sea, 150 miles south of Gradsul in Keoland, where he deals with merfolk, whales, dolphins, and many other denizens of the ocean. This fastness was once the dwelling of the druid Sverdras Meno. He visits the Free City of Greyhawk as little as possible, finding it stifling and distasteful, but visits Gradsul regularly. Drawmij possesses a magical metal boat he can pilot underwater. E =Eclavdra= Eclavdra is a powerful, exceptionally beautiful drow priestess of Lolth, Eclavdra is known for her cruelty and complex scheming, and her total lack of compassion. She eliminates rivals before they can become threats. In Gary Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels, Eclavdra is depicted as incredibly beautiful, with jet black skin, violet eyes, perfect breasts, and silvery or snow-white hair. However, she is as evil as she is beautiful. Eclavdra is the leader of House Eilservs and the most powerful priestess of Lolth. Her former consorts include Derakhshan and the demon lord Graz'zt. She also has a son, Athux. With Stalmin Klim she helped create the Slave Lords. The Slave Lord Edralve is her former prot√©g√©. A native of the city of Erelhei- Cinlu and member of House Eilservs, Eclavdra has served other powerful entities in the past, notably the Elder Elemental Eye and Graz'zt. For at time, she could be found at Iuz's court, acting as an ambassador. After Eclavdra's alliance with the Elder Elemental Eye jeopardized Lolth's attempt to bring the world of Oerth into the Demonweb Pits, she fell out of favor with her goddess. Her consort Derakhshan, seeing which way the wind was blowing, gave away details on her stronghold's defenses to her enemies among the other drow houses, though Eclavdra escaped. She regained Lolth's favor by seducing and eventually betraying Graz'zt. Athux, a powerful half demon drow, was the child born of that union. Eclavdra now serves as Lolth's chief diplomat, as well as the supreme mortal ruler of her organization and religion. Lolth admires ambition above loyalty, and thus Eclavdra is one of the most favored denizens of the Abyss. Eclavdra is a major villain in Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels. She also has a clone in the series, Leda, who becomes Gord's lover. In the novel Against the Giants, Eclavdra was killed. In the novels, it is revealed that Nemis the mage was once her servant, but is no longer. Created by Gary Gygax, Eclavdra first appeared in Hall of the Fire Giant King (1978). Eclavdra was initially depicted as the high priestess of the Elder Elemental God. In Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels, she is shown to be in the service of the demon lord Graz'zt. In later Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks, Eclavdra is shown as having \\"returned\\" to the worship of Lolth. In Iuz the Evil, she is the ambassador to Iuz for both Graz'zt and Lolth simultaneously. Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss has her betraying Graz'zt in return for Lolth's accolades. Eclavdra is given a statistics block in Lolth's entry in the 4th edition Monster Manual 3, as an exarch of Lolth.Baur, Wolfgang, and Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel.

A native of Erelhei-Cinlu, Edralve was an exile from that city for some time during the late 560s to early 570s. By 574 CY, however, she had joined with Stalman Klim and other persons of malicious intent to form the Slave Lords, settling in the hidden city of Suderham in the Pomarj. After the Slave Lords lost power in 580 CY, Edralve left the organization and returned to Erelhei- Cinlu.Cook, David, Allen Hammack, Harold Johnson, Tom Moldvay, Lawrence Schick, and Edward Carmien.

In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords (TSR, 1981). =Eli Tomorast= Eli Tomorast is a wizard and the primary antagonist in the Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure module. Described as a gaunt human with black hair and facial hair, his forearms and hands have been replaced by those of an unknown demon, giving him additional powers which make him a more powerful adversary in the module. In the original adventure, published in 1984, Tomorast had little background, and served only as the owner of the Tome of the Black Heart, an artifact which Eli discovered in the Lost City of Elders somewhere to the east. In the original module's timeline, Eli is slain by Mordenkainen, who was the character run by Gary Gygax. Mordenkainen was also printed in the module as a pre-generated character for players to use if they wished. In 2004, Dungeon magazine published \\"Maure Castle\\" in issue #112. This was an update to the original module, and presented a continuation of Eli's story. In the update, Eli was resurrected by a gnoll cleric of Yeenoghu who sought the power of the Tome of the Black Heart and its guardian, Kerzit. In this update, Eli, is bent on revenge against Mordenkainen and his associates. Little is known of Eli Tomorast's early years. What is known is that at some point, he visited the Lost City of the Elders, possibly as a member of a Seeker expedition, where he discovered the Tome of the Black Heart, a powerful artifact which gave Tomorast the ability to summon and control a powerful demon named Kerzit. Tomorast set up Kerzit as a false god in order to expand his power, and provided sacrifices to the demon. In the 550s CY, Tomorast led a band of renegade Seekers to the ruins of Maure Castle, which he successfully entered and began looting. However, Tomorast had an ulterior agenda as well, for he wished to establish a concealed place to summon Kerzit. In the 560s CY, Mordenkainen and his companions Bigby, Riggby, and Yrag delved into the dungeons to face off against Tomorast and his Seekers, seemingly killing Tomorast and several of his men and making off with many of the choicest treasures of the subcomplex. However, Tomorast was not dead for long‚Äîhe was raised by a cleric of the gnoll demon lord Yeenoghu. Soon, with a revamped Seeker organization, Tomorast began delving deeper into the secrets of the castle, recently even finding some communication between the outlying complex he has occupied and the main dungeon complex under the castle proper. Tomorast eventually discovered a way into the true dungeons of Maure Castle, and set about gathering the power required to take his revenge.Kuntz, Robert J. and Gary Gygax. Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure (TSR, 1984).Kuntz, Robert J., Erik Mona, James Jacobs & Gary Gygax. \\"Maure Castle.\\" Dungeon #112 (Paizo Publishing, 2004). =Erac's Cousin= =Evard= Evard, also known as Evard the Black, is a neutral evil archmage responsible for developing such spells as Evard's Black Tentacles. Evard is known to operate from the Sheldomar Valley, where he deals as an information broker. He is an enemy of Mordenkainen. Evard is a man of sturdy build and average musculature, with pale skin and long dark hair. He wears rich clothing, often belted with a white sash, and a large purple gemstone hangs from his throat. He is a charming man with a ready grin. Evard was originally a minor noble in the March of Bissel. He came to be a very successful broker of information, and many sages and loremasters send him knowledge in return for solving vexing questions of their own. If he doesn't know something, someone in his network does. He is ambitious and cunning, and will readily betray his allies if it suits him. He can be found in any of the major cities of the Sheldomar. In addition to the commonly known spell, Evard's Black Tentacles, Evard has also developed the following spells: Evard's All-Seeing Worm and Evard's Menacing Tentacles. Evard is known to have authored the following works: Legendary of Phantoms and Ghosts.\\"Critical Threats: Evard.\\" Dungeon #107 (Paizo Publishing, 2004).Holian, Gary, Erik Mona, Sean K Reynolds, and Fred Weining.

G =Gord the Rogue= I =Iggwilv= =Iuz= J =Jallarzi Sallavarian= K =Kargoth= Kargoth, more commonly known as Saint Kargoth, is a death knight of great power. He is also known as \\"the Betrayer\\", and \\"King of the Death Knights\\". His symbol is a glowing green skull. Saint Kargoth is of massive size and build, standing seven feet tall. His skeletal features are a baleful, glowing green color thanks to the fiendish surgeries and grafts his patron Demogorgon has subjected him to. He rides a glowing green chariot drawn by six nightmares. Saint Kargoth possesses the Bilious Sphere, a corrupt parody of the Orb of Sol. Saint Kargoth is a powerful servant of Demogorgon steeped in the politics of the Abyss. He is the mortal foe of Saint Benedor of the Ashen Hand, who was chosen over Kargoth to lead the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom. Kargoth is worshipped (along with the other original death knights) by the Sunsebb Sodality and regarded as a saint by renegade elements in the church of Hextor. Saint Kargoth is currently contending with Murlynd over an artifact known as the Quannon. Saint Kargoth dwells in Kolurenth, a stone fortress atop a rocky pinnacle protruding from the sea in the Demogorgon's realm of Gaping Maw. While the death knight is often away on business involving the Prime Material Plane, his fortress always hosts important human visitors. A sickly brown pool in Kargoth's private quarters is a two-way portal to Demogorgon's palace of Abysm. Formerly a 2nd to 3rd-century CY Torquann nobleman and paladin of Heironeous known as Lord Kargoth of Mansbridge, Kargoth was born 141 CY in the Great Kingdom of Aerdy. After Benedor was chosen over Kargoth to lead the Knight Protectors, Kargoth's jealousy and bitterness allowed him to be seduced by the demon prince Demogorgon, who granted him the power he craved by transforming him into the first death knight in 203 CY. Kargoth, in turn, gathered thirteen fellow Knight Protectors to his cause, who were also transformed into death knights by Demogorgon. Kargoth formerly lived at Castle Fharlanst, located on the Aerdi coast between Winetha and Roland, until it was destroyed by the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom in 247 CY. Kargoth's betrayal is regarded by many as the beginning of the end of the Knight Protectors. Kargoth's famous sword, Gorgorin the Shatterer, was lost when he battled the legendary Hainard of the Whiteguard.Bennie, Scott. \\"Setting Saintly Standards.\\" Dragon #79 (TSR, November 1983).Holian, Gary. \\"The Death Knights of Oerth.\\" Dragon #290 (Paizo Publishing, December 2001).Holian, Gary. \\"Demogorgon's Champions: The Death Knights of Oerth, part 2.\\" Dragon #291 (Paizo Publishing, January 2002).Holian, Gary, Erik Mona, Sean K.

Bellevue, WA: Paizo Publishing, 2007. =Kas the Bloody-Handed= Kas the Bloody-Handed was the most trusted lieutenant of the despotic lich Vecna, and wielder of the Sword of Kas. After many years of loyal service to Vecna, Kas eventually betrayed his master. It is said that the sword itself whispered to Kas, convincing him to slay his master and usurp his power. The battle destroyed Vecna's Rotting Tower, and cost the lich his left hand and eye. Kas himself was flung across the multiverse to Vecna's Citadel Cavitius on the Quasielemental Plane of Ash. The time he spent so close to the Negative Energy Plane changed him into a vampire, and he decided he would be called \\"Kas the Destroyer\\". The first edition of Dungeon Master's Guide does not specifically state that Kas severed Vecna's hand and eye, only that they, and the Sword of Kas, were the only objects that survived the battle. Vecna: Hand of the Revenant depicts the lich losing his left hand and eye to destructive magic casts by priests of Pholtus (presumably to be restored at a future point in the story). Numerous third edition sources state with certainty that Vecna's hand and eye were severed by Kas's blade. Sources are also not in complete agreement as to when or how Kas became a vampire, as some state he gained his dark gift before his betrayal, while others state that he gained it after. When Vecna was defeated during his bid for control of Oerth, Kas was freed from his centuries of imprisonment, only to find himself facing a shapeless wall of mist. When it cleared, he was master of the domain of Tovag, across the Burning Peaks from Vecna's domain of Cavitius. Kas waged an endless war of attrition with Vecna's forces in the hopes of retrieving the Sword of Kas from Vecna's citadel, where he erroneously believed Vecna held it. The Burning Peaks cluster did not appear in the 3rd Edition Ravenloft Campaign Setting, because White Wolf Game Studio did not license characters that are explicitly tied to other D&D; campaign settings. When Vecna escaped from Cavitius, both realms were destroyed (explaining, in-fiction, their absence from 3rd edition). Kas was caught up in the destruction and very nearly obliterated; he survives only as a vestige, a soul outside time and space whose powers can be used by binders. Kas is known to have authored Legendry of Great Arms and Fabulous Heroes.Heard, Bruce. \\"Spells Between the Covers.\\" Dragon #82 (TSR, 1984) In the adventure Die, Vecna, Die!, a death knight calling himself \\"Kas the Bloody-Handed\\" serves Vecna in the deity's palace in Ravenloft. This death knight is not the true Kas, though he believes himself to be, and his real name is not given. This false Kas seeks to redeem himself for \\"his\\" betrayal of Vecna centuries ago. =Keraptis= Keraptis is an evil wizard, and the main antagonist of the module White Plume Mountain. Little is known of the early life of Keraptis. Perhaps as early as c. -1500 CY, he established himself as protector of the Flan enclave of Tostenhca in the Griff Mountains. By c. -1100 CY, the wizard was driven out of the settlement. Circa -800 CY, Keraptis took over White Plume Mountain, near Rift Canyon, with an army of gnomish warriors, personally slaying the previous guardian of the mountain, the druid Aegwareth. Keraptis dwelt in White Plume Mountain for nine centuries afterward, finally abandoning his lair sometime in the 100s CY to further his research. By the late 5th century CY, a band of adventurers known as the Brotherhood of the Tome stole the magical weapons Blackrazor, Frostrazor, Wave, and Whelm from White Plume Mountain. Realizing they needed protection from further such raids, the gnomes of the mountain opened up Keraptis' old laboratory, deploying magic that rewrote the personalities of those who read it with partial copies of Keraptis' own. The result was the first False Keraptis, a gnome who truly believed itself to be the original. Though this False Keraptis eventually died, further ones came into being: Nightfear, Spatterdock, Killjoy, Mossmutter, and Zhawar Orlysse all believe themselves to be the one true Keraptis. Keraptis authored Pyronomicon.Cordell, Bruce R.

White Plume Mountain (TSR, 1979). L =Lashonna= Lashonna is a silver dragon vampire and the highest ranking cleric to the god Kyuss. Centuries ago, she was slain by Dragotha, the dracolich and most powerful servant of Kyuss. However, upon her death, the dark god resurrected her as a vampire. Over the centuries, Lashanna became the most devoted servant to Kyuss to the point of declaring herself his wife when the Age of Worms arrives. She is jealous of her god's favoritism of Dragotha, yet too weak to act against the dracolich. Along with an avolakia Mahuudril, she founded the Ebon Triad, a cult that believes Erythnul, god of slaughter, Hextor, god of tyranny, and Vecna, god of secrets, are three parts of the one evil god. In reality, however, known only to herself and Mahuudril, the cult's activities empower Kyuss and help usher his propheized Age of Worms. She holds great influence over the kingdom Redhand in the Bandit Kingdom and its ruler Prince Zeech, where she makes her home, appearing as a beautiful elven woman. Lashonna is a major antagonist in the Age of Worms campaign. =Leomund= Leomund, also known as Leomund the Red, is a clever and practical archmage and former member of the Circle of Eight. Greyhawk Ruins names him as a rumored member of the Ring of Five. He always kept his whereabouts circumspect, but it is thought he once lived in Medegia. Leomund, an immigrant from the East, was already ancient when he joined the Circle of Eight in approximately 571 CY. He retired from the Circle in 576 CY, citing other compelling uses of his time. He was replaced by Otiluke later that year and has been seldom heard from since, and not at all in recent years. Leomund developed the spells Leomund's Hidden Lodge, Leomund's Lamentable Belaborment, Leomund's Secret Chest, Leomund's Secure Shelter, Leomund's Tiny Hut, and Leomund's Trap. He authored or co-authored Architecture (with Mordenkainen), Forgotten Arts of Oratory Magnetism, Thesis on the Planes of Anti-Matter, and Transcendental Impenetrabilities. Leomund is the creator of \\"Leomund's plate and cup\\". Made of engraved silver, gold, or platinum, these finely crafted dishes produce delicious meals and alcoholic drinks on command, at variable frequencies per day depending on the nature of the item. After use, they must be cleaned with sweet or holy water once a week or permanently stop functioning. Leomund was the player character of Len Lakofka, who has stated vehemently that his character was never a member of the Circle of Eight. Instead, in the Oerth Journal #10, he suggested that the Circle member was an impostor whose true name was \\"Guy Gas\\". The class levels, birth date, and alignment attributed to him above come from Lakofka's Oerth Journal article, and must be considered apocryphal.Gygax, Gary.

Loran is eternally haunted by the spirit of his murdered wife. Before his death, Loran was the final Lord of Trollpyre Keep, a minor estate located in southern Sunndi, near the Vast Swamp. An evil, twisted man who hid his true nature behind a mask of honor and stoicism, Loran sought to be known for founding a great warrior-household. To this end, Loran took Lyra, a beautiful dancer, as his wife, but she bore him a daughter instead of a son. Enraged, Loran slew his wife, daughter, and the midwife, using his magic blade, Trollpyre's Defender. Loran's mother-in-law, a priestess, put a curse upon Loran‚Äîhe was to die painfully in battle, then rise as one of the undead, and be haunted by the spirits of his wife and daughter for all eternity. Upon rising as a death knight, Loran was unable to sire children, and thus his line died with him. Some time after his transformation, Loran lured a troupe of wandering performers to his keep and tortured them to death. This act succeeded in drawing him into the mists of Ravenloft. Eventually making his way to Cavitius, Sir Loran entered Vecna's service. However, Lyra and her child were also there, and continued to haunt him.Cordell, Bruce, and Steve Miller. Die Vecna Die! (Wizards of the Coast, 2000).Holian, Gary. \\"Demogorgon's Champions: The Death Knights of Oerth, part 2.\\" Dragon #291 (Paizo Publishing, 2002). =Lorana Kath= Lady Lorana Kath is a death knight, one of the 13 who betrayed the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom. In the game, Kath was once a cleric of Hextor of great power, and she is considered the catalyst for the betrayal of the Death Knights through her seduction of Lord Kargoth. Lady Lorana Kath augments her skeletal visage with gruesome masks made from the severed faces of young maidens. She often accessorizes her plate armor with a bloody apron and bridal veil. Within the Greyhawk world, Kath was known as a powerful priestess of Hextor in life and was admitted into the Knight Protectors in an unorthodox manner, as a recognition for her medical skills on the battlefield. However, Kath was possessed of a scheming and ambitious mind, and desired to marry herself to a leading Aerdi noble to aid in her pursuit of power in the Great Kingdom. She was betrothed to Prince Moranvich in 196, but the engagement soon fell apart. After the death of Knight Commander Lord Nidramon the Hextorian in 202 CY, Kath began to court the favor of Lord Kargoth, a powerful Heironean who most felt would be chosen as Nidramon's replacement. However, when the Council Gallant instead chose Sir Benedor Monlath of Chathold, Kath was there to fan the fires of Kargoth's rage. After Kargoth failed to overcome Benedor in a duel at the later's investiture in 203 CY, he was seduced by the demon lord Demogorgon, who transformed the mighty paladin into Oerth's first death knight. Kargoth soon assembled thirteen of his fellow Knight Protectors, including Kath, to plot revenge. Kargoth led his allies on a raid of the Temple of Lothan near Rel Deven, in order to seize an ancient Oeridian artifact known as the Orb of Sol. Using foul magic granted to him by Demogorgon, Kargoth used the Orb to deliver his allies to his master, transforming them into death knights as well, and also to unleash a great demonic horror known as Arendagrost, Maw of the Abyss, upon the land. Kath, unlike Kargoth, has no interest in advancing the plans of Demogorgon, and still considers herself a priestess of Hextor. She maintains an estate to the northwest of the Stringen region of the North Kingdom, where she amuses herself with research into the Ur-Flan and their necromantic practices. It is said that Kath's research into these ancient sorcerers led her to develop the means to create animi, the unique undead servitors of Ivid V in the last years of his reign. Kath supposedly created the process as a means of reversing the transformation invoked upon herself. =Lum the Mad= Baron Lum the Mad is a mighty Oeridian warlord whose power was at least partially due to his possession of the artifact known as the Infernal Machine. Lum was betrayed by his former general, Leuk-o, when the latter came to possess the artifact later known as the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o. Their final conflict left a large area wasted. A mysterious mist appeared, and Lum plunged through a dimensional rift to the plane of Limbo, where Lum waited for centuries, his connection to the machine leaving him unable to die. The machine was housed in the fortress Rifter, near Rauxes, until the city was destroyed in 586 CY, quite likely due to the machine's wild influence. Baron Lum lived a life obsessed with war and conquest, trained for it from boyhood, when he was rewarded for thinking and planning but punished for frivolous behavior. His first experience with the love of the opposite sex was twisted, painful, and empty. He grew to be a handsome man with rugged features marred with only a few scars. More than eight centuries ago he discovered the sword Druniazth, an artifact sacred to Tharizdun. He wielded it against Ur-Flannae sorcerers of the Thelwood, but lost it during the fray. He spent the rest of his time on Oerth searching for it, the effort slowly driving him insane. Years later, while exploring a castle his armies had conquered, he came across the Machine that would bear his name, a horseshoe-shaped nightmare of black metal, festooned with levers, dials, sockets, wires, and plugs. Through trial and error, he learned to manipulate it, learning more about its functioning than even the wisest sages have since then. If he was mad before, the blasphemous technology of the device drove him over the edge, but it also brought him great power. With his disciplined troops and his new powers, he carved out a mighty fiefdom. It is said that, with the machine, he brought no fewer than 50 new species of monsters into the world. He thought nothing of barrages of fire that annihilated large numbers of his own troops, so long as he carried the day. His reign was one of cruelty and horror, but it is credited in part for the impressive Oeridian successes in the days before their victories over the rival Suel and Flan were assured. Lum's reign approached its twilight when his formerly loyal subordinate, General Leuk-O, discovered the Mighty Servant artifact in the Belching Vortex that would become known by his name. Some believe the Mighty Servant and the Infernal Machine were created by the same otherworldly artificer, and the appearance of them both so close together was no coincidence. It is said the quasi-deity Krovis awoke from his sleep during this period to help bring Lum's tyranny to an end. With the power of the Mighty Servant, Leuk-O gathered a host that matched Lum's own. The two armies clashed many times before their final battle, when Lum disappeared. The fate of Leuk-O is unknown. Lum and his Infernal Machine have been featured in the computer games Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, as being imprisoned in Watcher's Keep, and briefly at the end of Planescape: Torment when the final boss refers to a time when the Nameless One \\"danced sorceries with Lum the Mad\\".Bloch, Joseph. \\"See the Pomarj  and Die!\\" Dragon #167.

He is also the Assistant Guildmaster of Greyhawk's Guild of Thieves. Nerof Gasgal was born 540 CY in Greyhawk. At some point, he joined the Guild of Thieves, which was then under the leadership of Guildmaster Arentol. In 570 CY, Gasgal became Lord Mayor of Greyhawk (it is assumed that he was a member of the Directing Oligarchy prior to that). One of the youngest mayors in Greyhawk's history, Gasgal and his allies on the Directing Oligarchy (who include Org Nenshen, his best friend, former partner, and guildmaster of the Thieves Guild) brought great changes and dynamism to the city government, including reforming the city's currency. Gasgal has led Greyhawk for almost three decades, bringing the city to victory over its enemies, expanding its territory, and increasing its wealth. In fact, Gasgal is regarded as one of Greyhawk's greatest mayors, second only to Zagig Yragerne.Holian, Gary, Erik Mona, Sean K Reynolds, and Frederick Weining.

Available online: =Nolzur= Nolzur is an illusionist and alchemist (and former thief) once part of the famed Company of Seven. After many adventures, he rose to the status of quasi-deity. As a member of the Company of Seven, he adventured with Zagig Yragerne, Heward, Keoghtom, Murlynd, Quaal, and Tasha. He still has not forgiven Keoghtom. Nolzur began his career in Radigast City in the County of Urnst as a thief. His early travels took him to many places, including Blackmoor and the Pirate Isles. He joined Zagig Yragerne's Company of Seven, accompanying them on wild adventures in the early 300s CY. He journeyed with Murlynd and Keoghtom to the Cold Marshes in search of ruins of a civilization of sorcerous amphibians. There the three adventurers battled a lich-queen known as the Weird of the Cold Heath. Nolzur argued that they should keep her disease-causing staff for use as a weapon against Iuz, but Keoghtom decided to reverse its effects instead, creating an item known as Keoghtom's Staff of Purification. Nolzur and Keoghtom's differences became irreconcilable more than a century ago when, according to repute, Keoghtom borrowed one of Nolzur's formulas in order to aid the creation of his famed Keoghtom's Ointment. This caused a permanent wedge in the Company of Seven, and the group went their separate ways. Nolzur went into seclusion, Zagig retired to his castle, and Murlynd and Keoghtom left the Oerth behind to explore other planes of existence. Nolzur's reclusiveness has caused his fame to fade in recent decades. Nolzur created Nolzur's marvelous pigments and Nolzur's orb.Gygax, Gary. World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting. Lake Geneva, WI: TSR, 1983. =Nystul= Nystul is an archmage and member of the Circle of Eight. He is also the most famous native of the Duchy of Tenh. At one time, Nystul had an apprentice named Janina. Nystul developed the spells Nystul's Magic Aura, Nystul's Undetectable Aura, Nystul's Blacklight Burst, Nystul's Blackmote, Nystul's Blazing Beam, Nystul's Crystal Dagger, Nystul's Crystal Dirk, Nystul's Dancing Dweomer, Nystul's Dancing Werelight, Nystul's Enveloping Darkness, Nystul's Expeditious Fire Extinguisher, Nystul's Flash, Nystul's Golden Revelation, Nystul's Grue Conjuration, Nystul's Lightburst, Nystul's Radiant Arch, and Nystul's Radiant Baton.

O =Obmi= Obmi, sometimes called Lord Obmi, is a murderous mountain dwarven fighter and member of Iuz's Boneshadow. He has iron grey hair, has a taciturn personality, and delights in playing power games. Originally from the Crystalmists, he is known as \\"the Hammer of Iuz\\" due to his use of the dwarven throwing hammer, and \\"Obmi the Wily\\" for his cunning. He appears in the Gord the Rogue novels as an enemy of Gord, Leda, and Eclavdra. Obmi is sometimes accompanied by a deranged grey elf fighter/mage named Keak and a gnomish illusionist/rogue named Gleed. In the past, Obmi was a slave of, then advisor to, the fire giant king Snurre Ironbelly. Obmi's early history is unknown. He is known to have been a slave of the fire giant king, Snurre Ironbelly of the Hellfurnaces from 546 to 551 CY. By 551 CY, Obmi had proven his worth as an advisor, and served King Snurre for the next twenty-five years in that role. In 576 CY, Snurre's hall was raided by adventurers. Obmi escaped by masquerading as a dwarven prince. Shortly after his escape, Obmi joined the service of Iuz. Creative origins Obmi first appeared in Gary Gygax's original Castle Greyhawk campaign between 1972 and 1973, where he was placed in an old magical laboratory in the center of the third level of the dungeon. Gygax gave him boots of speed, a dwarven thrower, and several gnoll henchmen. He also had a magical device that shot a ray that teleported the PCs to another part of the dungeon if they failed their saves. After many unsuccessful attempts, the PCs (the Citadel of Eight) finally destroyed the device, but Obmi escaped. Their hatred of Obmi did not diminish.Gygax, Gary.

Hall of the Fire Giant King (TSR, 1978). =Otiluke= =Otto= Otto is a powerful human wizard, and member of the Circle of Eight. Otto is short and rotund, with shoulder-length curly hair, and a well-groomed mustache. He tends to dress in fine, expensive garb. Originally a priest of Boccob in Almor, Otto soon found he had an uncanny knack for wizardry, and became quite skilled in the arcane arts. At the secret prompting of Mordenkainen, he became a henchman of Robilar for a time. Otto is a lover of fine food and music. He owns a manor in Greyhawk City's Garden Quarter, where he is a generous patron of the arts. In Gary Gygax's original Greyhawk home game, Otto was a denizen of the second level beneath Castle Greyhawk. Robilar, Tenser, and Terik encountered him while adventuring there. Otto was subdued by Tenser, but decided to work for Robilar. He subsequently gained levels rapidly, rarely straying from Robilar's side. In the original campaign, Otto was chaotic neutral and reached 18th level as a single-class magic user of chaotic neutral alignment. Otto is known to have authored or co-authored the following works: Aestrella (a magical aria of his composition) and Arcane Manipulations of the Entourage. Otto is responsible for developing the commonly known spell Otto's irresistible dance. Many of the spells he has created are specialized by sound, sonic, or musical motifs. Otto has also developed the following additional spells: Otto's chime of release, Otto's crystal rhythms, Otto's drums of despair, Otto's gong of isolation, Otto's imperative ambulation, Otto's silver tongue, Otto's soothing vibrations, Otto's sure-footed shuffle, Otto's tin soldiers, Otto's tonal attack, Otto's tones of forgetfulness, and Otto's warding tones.Gygax, Gary.

R =Rary= In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, Rary of Ket is a powerful archmage and ruler of the Bright Lands, also known as Rary the Traitor. In a storyline developed by TSR for a resetting of the Greyhawk campaign in 1991, Rary, a member of the Circle of Eight, betrayed the Circle at the end of the Greyhawk Wars and was responsible for the deaths of Circle members Otiluke and Tenser. After his betrayal, Rary fled with his ally Lord Robilar to the Bright Desert, where he established the Empire of the Bright Lands. =Riggby= Riggby, also known as Riggby the Patriarch, was a major cleric of Boccob and a companion of the archmage Mordenkainen. In his prime, Riggby had black hair and chestnut-colored eyes. He customarily wore robes of light gray and off-white. He was a fiery evangelist for his uncaring deity, often demanding that unbelievers convert or die. He pursued temporal power in order to better maintain the spirituality of those among him. Besides Boccob, he also revered Zagyg. Riggby began his career as a priest at a small chapel. At some point, he met with Mordenkainen and other members of an adventuring band the wizard was forming, and soon became a founding member of the Citadel of Eight. Riggby was one of the adventurers, along with Mordenkainen, Bigby and Yrag, who delved into Maure Castle to face off against Eli Tomorast and the demon Kerzit.Kuntz, Robert J. Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure. TSR, 1984. Riggby, along with Mordenkainen's Citadel of Eight also delved into the dungeons underneath the Temple of Elemental Evil. In 570 CY, Riggby accompanied Lord Robilar into the dungeons underneath Castle Greyhawk in an ill-fated attempt to free, and then permanently kill, the demigod Iuz, who had been imprisoned there since 505 CY by Zagig Yragerne. Sometime after the failure and release of the demigod, he settled down in Greyhawk City as the head of city's great temple of Boccob, and spent much of the balance of his life in retirement. In 597 CY, Riggby died of natural causes in Verbobonc, as depicted in the module Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk.Bulmahn, Jason, Jacobs, James, and Mona, Eric. Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk Wizards of the Coast, 2007, pg. 4. His body was taken to Greyhawk for burial. It would be Riggby's death that set in motion the latest of Iuz's gambits to destroy the city, revenge himself on Mordenkainen and Robilar and strike out for domination of the Flanaess. As with many of the original Greyhawk characters, Riggby grew out of a character played by Gary Gygax during the first campaigns run by him and Robert J. Kuntz. Riggby originated as one of a series of \\"henchmen\\" characters who followed Mordenkainen, and was named by Kuntz employing a serial naming convention (all the names ended in \\"-igby\\") that also yielded the name Bigby. He first appeared in print in the 1980 supplement The Rogues' Gallery,Blume, Brian, Cook, Dave, and Jean Wells. The Rogues' Gallery. TSR, 1980, page 46 and was revised four years later by Kuntz for use as a player character for Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure. =Robilar= Castle Greyhawk sessions Robilar was originally the creation of Rob Kuntz, rolled up on Gary Gygax's kitchen table in late 1972 for the second- ever session of the game that would become known as Dungeons & Dragons. Gygax even suggested the name \\"Robilar\\", after a minor character in The Gnome Cache, a novella Gygax was writing that eventually would be serialized in the first few issues of The Dragon starting in June 1976.Kuntz: \\"Robilar's name is derived from Gary's novel, The Gnome Cache. Written prior to the formation of TSR, Robilar occurs therein as the baron who sends the questing Dunstan after the gnome treasure. Since I had contributed a minor sequence idea to the novel (wherein Dunstan, having succeeded, requires the Baron Robilar to uphold his part of the bargain by knighting him, which he does, quickly and without ceremony and then runs off to claim fame from higher-ups for \\"his\\", the Baron's, success) Gary later suggested the name for my primary PC in Greyhawk.\\" Kuntz quickly grew impatient with play when it involved more than a couple of players, often playing solo adventures one-on-one with Gygax;Q:\\"What was the largest party Robilar ever adventured with (I mean, with other player characters)?\\" Kuntz: \\"Probably 6-7 in the earlier days. That then was too much for my wonts, which spurred me to seek solo adventures when possible.\\" their constant (almost daily) play meant that Robilar rapidly gained power and possessions. As the city of Greyhawk was developed and fleshed out, Robilar also became the secret owner of the Green Dragon Inn in the city of Greyhawk, where he kept tabs on happenings in the city. Robilar was not only the first to reach the 13th and bottom level of Gygax's Greyhawk dungeons, but on the way, he was also responsible for freeing nine demi-gods (whom Gygax revived a decade later as some of the first deities of Greyhawk: Iuz, Ralishaz, Trithereon, Erythnul, Olidammara, Heironeous, Celestian, Hextor, and Obad- Hai). Temple of Elemental Evil sessions Robilar was also the first to enter Gygax's Temple of Elemental Evil, and trashed it from top to bottom, even freeing the demoness Zuggtmoy from her prison at the centre of the Temple. Kuntz later related that Gygax was very dismayed that his masterpiece dungeon had been destroyed by a single adventurer, and as punishment, Gygax had an army pursue Robilar all the way back to his castle, which Robilar was forced to abandon.Kuntz: \\"Gary was none too happy with Robilar's adventure beneath the Temple of Elemental Evil. Robilar had a great time dismembering creatures, crunching things and watching Gary's look of consternation grow with every toppled column. The final straw was the releasing of Zuggtmoy. The DM's vendetta pursued Robilar all the way back to his castle, which he was forced to abandon.\\" Kuntz: \\"Losing my castle was a major defeat, but I decided to abandon it because [Gygax] was noticeably intent on getting even with me for the Temple of Elemental Evil sacking I‚Äôd perpetrated.\\" Robilar even lost possession of the Green Dragon Inn.Kuntz: \\"The city, at the instigation of those Good forces, especially Tenser, had [the Green Dragon] confiscated.\\" Robilar's various adventures were mentioned by Gygax in his column in Dragon magazine. Later publications  Robilar was also profiled in The Rogues Gallery, a 1980 TSR publication, along with other notable characters mentioned in Gygax's works such as Tenser and Erac's Cousin. He was described as a world-weary warrior and survivor of many adventures who had changed his worldview from neutral to evil to satisfy his morbid tastes. His three passions in life were adventuring, magic items, and information. When Gygax was forced out of TSR at the end of 1985, TSR took over the creative rights to all characters mentioned in any of Gygax's articles, adventures and stories, including Robilar. Several years later, TSR created a new storyline for Gygax's World of Greyhawk that featured the murder of several members of the Circle of Eight by Robilar and the archmage Rary. Kuntz, as the creator of Robilar, was unhappy with this, stating that Robilar would never turn on his old adventuring companion, Mordenkainen (Gygax's own D&D; character). Although Kuntz had long since left TSR and had no creative control over Robilar's published life, he suggested in print that the person responsible for aiding Rary was in fact a clone or evil twin of Robilar's who had \\"taken over\\" Robilar's apparent life while Robilar was off adventuring on a distant plane. This suggestion became a \\"fact\\" in 2007 with the publication of Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk, where it is revealed that Robilar had been imprisoned by an evil \\"twin\\" from another universe named Bilarro, who had then impersonated the hero while he aided Rary in his evil actions. S =Serten= Serten is a powerful priest of Saint Cuthbert and member of the Citadel of Eight. He is rumored to be a member of the Ring of Five. Though he had low intelligence and was never truly respected by the rest of the Citadel of Eight, Serten was well-meaning, kindly, and likable and seen as useful. He liked to adventure, but wasn't seen as competent enough to go on his own, as he was often too dumb to run away when in danger and he seldom planned ahead. Serten was slain 569 CY at the Battle of Emridy Meadows, having finally been permitted to adventure without the rest of his party. Tenser blamed Mordenkainen for his death and left the Citadel of Eight over the issue. Serten is associated with Serten's Spell Immunity, though as a 10th level cleric he is unlikely to have developed what was an 8th level magic-user spell himself. Serten's Ring grants a continuous Serten's Spell Immunity effect while worn. It is currently in the possession of Lakaster of Winetha. Serten is said in Dragon #82 to have authored Arcane Resistance of Dwarves and Halflings, an arcane spellbook. Serten was originally a cleric played by Ernie Gygax, one of Gary Gygax's sons. Like Tenser, another of Ernie's characters, Serten is an anagram of his name, Ernest. Ernie also played Erac's Cousin and Erac. Although Serten was clearly labeled a cleric in The Rogues Gallery and the Living Greyhawk Journal #0, the existence of the Spell Immunity spell, his purported authorship of a wizardly spellbook, and a rumor in Greyhawk Ruins all point to the existence of a wizard called Serten. Ivid the Undying refers to Serten as a \\"legendary archmage\\".Blume, Brian, David Cook, and Jean Wells. The Rogues Gallery (TSR, 1980).Mobley, Blake, and Timothy B Brown. Greyhawk Ruins.

His wife is Queen Frupy. T =Tasha= When the AD&D; Players Handbook was first published, many of the wizards mentioned in the spell lists, such as Tenser and Bigby, were actual characters who had been created and played by Gary Gygax and his friends and children. However, the Tasha of Tasha's hideous laughter was actually named after a little girl who wrote letters to Gygax with crayons.Q: \\"Did you make up named spells like Melf's acid arrow, Otiluke's resilient sphere and Mordenkainen's disjunction yourself, or did these come from player research?\\" Gygax: \\"All of those spells I made up, usually to honor a PC in my campaign, or for the person who suggested the basis. Tasha [Tasha's hideous laughter] was a little girl who sent me letters in crayon, Nystul [Nystul's magic aura] was an actual stage magician I met through Len Lakofka. Melf [Melf's acid arrow] was a PC of son Luke, and Otiluke [Otiluke's resilient sphere] was a combination of a couple of his other PCs.\\" In later material, Gygax revealed that Tasha was an alias used by Iggwilv during her time as an apprentice of Zagig Yragerne and a member of the Company of Seven.Gygax, Gary. \\"From the Sorcerer's Scroll: New Magic-User Spells.\\" Dragon #67 (TSR, 1982).Gygax, Gary. Unearthed Arcana (TSR, 1985). =Tenser= =Theodain Eriason= Theodain Eriason is a powerful elven wizard, and the first non-human member of the Circle of Eight. A native of the Yeomanry, Theodain operates throughout the Sheldomar Valley, but makes his home in a small country estate outside Loftwick. Theodain is tall and gaunt for an elf. His hair is black, with a silver streak and his skin is very pale. He is sarcastic, arrogant, intelligent, and strongly in favor of the Circle of Eight intervening more strongly in world affairs. His cold demeanor has caused some to mistake him for a creature of evil. Theodain was born in the western Dreadwood. His family moved to the Yeomanry, near Loftwick, after the Yeomanry League declared its independence from Keoland. Theodain began his career as a warrior, and didn't take up the study of magic until 470 CY, when his father, who had been a Grossspokesman, died. He studied magic with elven wizards in the Dreadwood and at the magic school in Gradsul. Theodain has adventured widely, from the Underdark beneath the Hellfurnaces to battling elemental cults in the Hool Marshes. In 585 CY, Theodain was invited to join the Circle of Eight by Drawmij, who hoped to gain him as an ally against Jaran Krimeeah. At least, this is what Return of the Eight tells us. Living Greyhawk Journal #0 says that Drawmij argued vehemently against Theodain's inclusion, and treats him with only bland acceptance today. Theodain enjoys the company of Drawmij, Nystul, Otto, and Jallarzi Sallavarian, though Nystul argued against the acceptance of non-human members and the canon disagrees on Drawmij's relationship with him. Alhamazad and Warnes Starcoat treat Theodain with coolness. Theodain views them with suspicion and they see him as an irresponsible hothead. Theodain openly questions Mordenkainen's leadership at times, to the bare-pated wizard's annoyance. Theodain's greatest friend and ally is the dragon Hautna Masq, who has been known to assume his appearance and masquerade as him while in the Yeomanry.Mona, Erik, and Gary Holian. \\"Wheels within Wheels: Greyhawk's Circle of Eight.\\" Living Greyhawk Journal #0 (Wizards of the Coast, 2000).

V =Vecna= W =Warduke= =Warnes Starcoat= Warnes Starcoat is a powerful human wizard, and a member of the Circle of Eight since 585 CY. He is a Counselor to the Courts of Urnst and Chief Sorcerous Councilor (an office also known as \\"Chief Magical Councilor\\") to Duke Karll of the Duchy of Urnst. Warnes appears as a greatly refined gentleman of Suel ethnicity, though his complexion is tanned from spending much of his time outdoors. His beard is short and well-trimmed. He wears the Starcoat, a magical coat as black as the night that glimmers with distant stars, and is rarely seen without his wide-brimmed, plumed hat. His patron deity is Zagyg. Warnes was born in 534 CY in Leukish, capital of the Duchy of Urnst, to a merchant family of moderate influence and wealth. The third son of four, he was sent to the city of Seltaren when he came of age, to study magic at the Wizardholme of Urnst. Warnes proved to be quite talented, becoming a well-regarded generalist mage before the age of thirty. He was soon made a junior assistant to the Seer of Urnst, but left the position due to philosophical differences. Warnes' victory over the Weird of Gnatmarsh made him the most respected wizard in the region. Warnes helped retrieve the Crook of Rao from the Isle of the Ape, thwarting the machinations of Iggwilv. Warnes does not wish Agath of Thrunch to outshine him. He dislikes thieves. Alhamazad dislikes him. Jallarzi Sallavarian was at one time his student. Bigby only grudgingly agreed to admit him into the Circle. Theodain Eriason views him with suspicion, while Warnes in turn views Theodain as an unreliable firebrand whose methods are morally questionable at best.Brown, Anne.

Available online: Y =Yolande= Yolande is the grey elven queen of the elven kingdom of Celene. Her honorifics include \\"Her Fey Majesty,\\" the \\"Faerie Queen,\\" the \\"Perfect Flower of Celene,\\" and \\"Lady Rhalta of All Elvenkind\\". Yolande has white skin, lilac-colored eyes, and is breathtakingly beautiful. She was described by Gord the Rogue in Gary Gygax's novel, Artifact of Evil, as being more beautiful than any woman he'd ever seen. Yolande is advised by her chief advisor and cousin, a noble elf named Onselven. Prince Brightflame, better known as Melf, is also a cousin. Yolande has taken a number of Royal Consorts during her reign, the first being Prince Triserron, whose death prompted the Hateful Wars. Her most recent consort is Prince Fasstal Dothmar, wielder of Concluder. Yolande makes her home in Celene's capital of Enstad, where she resides in the Palace of the Faerie Queen. She is protected by the Knights of the Companion Guard. Originally from the Celene settlement of Bellmeadow, Princess Yolande was already an accomplished fighter and wizard when she ascended the throne in 361 CY. Yolande was chosen by the princes of the realm to unite the nation against expansionist Keoland. When the Keoish garrisons were expelled, Yolande organized Celene's defenses, whilst her consort, Prince Triserron, defeated the Keoish forces in a number of minor engagements. Near the end of the 5th century CY, Triserron was ambushed and slain by orcs in a narrow pass in the Lortmils, just south of Courwood. The death of her beloved led Yolande to lead her nation and the Ulek States in the Hateful Wars of 498-510 CY, clearing the Lortmils of every orc, goblin, and other evil humanoids. For her role in the hateful Wars, the Grand Court of Celene awarded Yolande the Mantle of the Blue Moon, naming her \\"Lady Rhalta of All Elvenkind\\". Such honors have done little to soothe Yolande's grief, however, and though she has since taken a number of consorts to with whom to engage in the Faerie Mysteries, many believe she has never recover from the loss of Triserron. Speculation holds that the Prince Consort's death is they key reason that Yolande has led Celene down an ever- increasing path of isolationism, a policy which not all of the people of Celene (notably the Knights of Luna) agree with. Celene's isolationism had grown so strong by the 580's CY that Yolande failed to offer assistance to the Principality of Ulek to turn back the orcish hordes of Turrosh Mak's Pomarj during the Greyhawk Wars of 582-584 CY. Though some speculate that Yolande may be controlled by evil forces or advisors, the truth is simply that the queen views elven lives as too valuable to waste in conflicts outside her realm.

His influence was felt in the development of Arizona Territory where he helped found both the city of Tempe and Arizona State University. Hayden is also known as the father of U.S. Senator Carl Hayden. Life and career Hayden was born on April 4, 1825 in the village of Haydens in Windsor, Hartford County, Connecticut, the son of Joseph and Mary Hanks Hayden. He was a descendant of English settlers who had come over in 1630 and settled in the Connecticut River valley. Hayden's father died when he was six, leaving himself and his sister Anna to help his mother run the family farm. He completed his education at 16 and worked as a clerk for several years before leaving home in 1843. His departure was motivated in part by a lung ailment. From Connecticut Hayden went to New York City, where he studied law, before beginning a series of teaching jobs in Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri. While in Kentucky, Hayden was influenced by Henry Clay's vision of opening the West to settlement by the development of roads and canals. By 1847, he was working as a teamster hauling freight on the Santa Fe Trail. Following ratification of the Gadsden Purchase, Hayden established a store in Tubac which served the nearby mines. By 1860, he had moved to Tucson and according to census records had assets worth US$20,000. In addition to working as a merchant, Hayden also worked as a freighter and civic leader. With the creation of Arizona Territory, he added mail contractor to his list of duties. Finally, he was appointed a probate judge by Governor Goodwin and he achieved the title \\"judge\\". Hayden's Ferry between 1870 and 1880 Hayden remained in Tucson until 1873 when he moved to the Salt River valley. Local legend claims that while he was on a business trip from Tucson to Prescott, flood waters on the Salt River delayed him near the present location of Tempe, Arizona for several days. Using this time to explore the site, Hayden saw the potential to develop a new town at the site. In December 1870, Hayden published a notice claiming two sections along the south side of the Salt River \\"for milling, farming, and other purposes\\". He used the land to build a cable ferry, grist mill, general store, and other related businesses. On October 4, 1876, at the age of 51, Hayden married Arkansas-born schoolteacher Sallie Calvert Davis in Nevada City, California. The couple would have four children, Carl Trumbull, Sallie Davis, Anna Spenser, and Mary \\"Mapes\\" Calvert. Anna died when two-and- a-half years old while the three other children reached maturity.

This was followed in 1884 when Grover Cleveland considered him for Governor of Arizona Territory. In 1885, Hayden succeeded in having a former employee, John S. Armstrong, elected to the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Believing the territory's need lie primarily in educating new teachers, Hayden used his connection with Armstrong to lobby for the Territorial Normal School. Hayden even favored the normal school over the fiscally more lucrative insane asylum, arguing \\"Stockton, California was known to most people only as the place where insane people are confined\\" and that Tempe should not risk gaining a similar reputation. The normal school established in Tempe is now Arizona State University. Hayden remained in Tempe for the rest of his life and died on February 5, 1900. He is buried in Tempe's Double Butte Cemetery.

However the song did not chart, but the band was featured playing the song in the glam rock movie Never Too Young To Rock, the same year. Slik were, formerly known by another name, Salvation, and were a popular local band, who played throughout Scotland. Salvation had one more member, Kevin McGinlay, brother of bassist Jim McGinlay, who left to follow a solo career in 1974; and without him, the band changed their name to Slik and signed a contract with Bay City Rollers' songwriters, Bill Martin and Phil Coulter. Martin & Coulter had just recently split with the Bay City Rollers and were looking for another Rollers type band. They struck big beginning with the second single, \\"Forever And Ever\\". At the time of this single however, the band had another look, very different from the baseball shirts and short haired look which characterised them later. This was a more glam style, with a long-haired Ure, Kenny Hyslop with his Bryan Ferry/Elvis Presley type quiff, while McGinlay and McIsaac had more elegant clothes; that can be seen in the Never Too Young To Rock movie and the promo photos at the time. Midge Ure was then 21 years old, and in the future he became an important figure of new wave music, as frontman of Ultravox, then called Tiger Lily and led by Dennis Leigh, later known as John Foxx and a successful electronic musician, who he replaced in 1979. The song was later used as the theme song of the Arrows show, a weekly TV pop series in the UK hosted by the band Arrows on the Granada / ITV network.

When waves crash on the shore, the force exerted on littoral organisms can be equivalent to several tons.  Roles of water  Water forms the ocean, produces the high density fluid environment and greatly affects the oceanic organisms. # Sea water produces buoyancy and provides support for plants and animals. That's the reason why in the ocean organisms can be that huge like the blue whale and macrophytes. And the densities or rigidities of the oceanic organisms are relative low compared with that of the terrestrial species. The water environment allows the organism to be soft, watery and huge. To be watery and transparent is a successful way to avoid predation. # Sea water can prevent desiccation although it is much saltier than fresh water. For oceanic organism, not like terrestrial plants and animals, water is never a problem. # Sea water carries oxygen and nutrients to oceanic organisms, which allow them to be planktonic or settled. The dissolved minerals and oxygen flow with currents/circulations. Oceanic plants and animals easily capture what they need for their daily life, which make them 'lazy' and 'slow'. # Sea water removes waste from animals and plants. Sea water is cleaner than we can imagine. Because of the huge volume of ocean, the waste produced by oceanic organisms and even human activities can hardly get the sea water polluted. The waste is not only 'waste' but also an important food source. Bacteria remineralize and recycle the organic matter back to the main oceanic food web. # Sea water transport organisms, which facilitates the food capture and fertilization. Many settled bottom organisms use their tentacles to catch planktonic food. Reynolds number Water flow can be described as laminar or turbulent. Laminar flow is characterized by smooth motion: neighboring particles advected by such a flow will follow similar paths. Turbulent flow is dominated by re-circulation, whorls, eddies and apparent randomness. In such a flow particles which are neighbors at one moment can find themselves widely separated later. Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. As the size of an organism and the strength of the current increases, inertial forces will eventually dominate, and the flow becomes turbulent (large Re). As the size and strength decrease, viscous forces eventually dominate and the flow becomes laminar (small Re). Biologically there is an important distinction between plankton and nekton. Plankton are the aggregate of relatively passive organisms which float or drift with the currents, such as tiny algae and bacteria, small eggs and larvae of marine organisms, and protozoa and other minute predators. Nekton are the aggregate of actively swimming organisms which are able to move independently of water currents, such as shrimps, forage fish and sharks. As a rule of thumb, plankton are small and, if they swim at all, do so at biologically low Reynolds numbers (0.001 to 10), where the viscous behaviour of water dominates and reversible flows are the rule. Nekton, on the other hand, are larger and swim at biologically high Reynolds numbers (103 to 109), where inertial flows are the rule and eddies (vortices) are easily shed. Many organisms, such as jellyfish and most fish, start life as larva and other tiny members of the plankton community, swimming at low Reynolds numbers, but become nekton as they grow large enough to swim at high Reynolds numbers. Bernoulli's Principle Bernoulli's Principle states that for an inviscid (frictionless) flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. One result of Bernoulli's Principle is that slower moving current has higher pressure. This principle is used, for example, by some benthic suspension feeders. These smart guys dig holes like U tubes with one end higher than the other end. Because of bottom drag, as water flows over the bottom the lower tube opening has a lower fluid speed and thus a higher pressure than the upper tube opening. The benthic suspension feeder can hide in the tube as the pressure difference between the tube ends drives water and suspended particles through the tube. The body shapes of many benthic creatures also exploit Bernoulli's Principle not only decrease the friction and drag but also to create lift when they move through the current. Drag Great white shark Drag is the tendency of an object to move in the direction of the flow. The magnitude of drag depends on the current velocity, the shape and size of the organism and the density of the fluid. Drag is a dissipative process which generally results in the generation of heat. In sea water, drag can be decomposed into two different forms: skin friction and pressure drag. # Skin friction: just like other frictional forces, skin friction is a consequence of the relative movement between the surface of the organisms and its fluid environment. Under conditions of low Re, where viscous forces dominate, the skin friction is apparent and is more important, although it is also present under high Re conditions. # Pressure drag: pressure drag is a result of the pressure difference in front of, and behind, an organism. Incidentally, the shape that has the lowest pressure drag coefficient is a hollow hemisphere oriented in the direction of fluid flow. In the oceanic environment plants and settled animals have bodies that are soft and flexible in order to minimize the effects of pressure drag. Besides being soft and flexible, organisms have other methods to minimize drag. * Smooth skin: dolphins have little tear drops in their skin which traps some water so water flows over the water that is trapped. The skin feels soft and flaky and sheds every two hours. This helps dolphins swim through the sea water at high speed. * Shark skin: the surface of shark skin is covered with tiny 'teeth' or dermal denticles. The shape and positioning of these denticles varies across the shark's body, altering the flow of water in a way to minimize form drag. * Barracuda skin: Barracuda have hundreds of skin conduits which force the fluid flows to follow the parallel tubes and become laminar. Again, this arrangement decreases water drag.

Biography  = Youth = Goldberg was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. In 1928 his father, Samuel Goldberg (born in 1901), immigrated to France bringing his wife Riwka Gelemer and his son in 1929. They stayed in Paris where two other children were born, Henry in 1931 and Max in 1934. = Second world war = When the mass arrest of more than 13,000 Jews, the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, was carried out in Paris on 16 July 1942, L√©on's parents sent him and his two brothers into hiding with a neighbour. His parents were arrested; his father was held at Beaune-la-Rolande and Camp of Royallieu transit camps before being deported to Auschwitz concentration camp on 31 July 1942. His mother and two brothers (Henry, 11 and Max, 8) were held at the Pithiviers and Drancy transit camps, and deported to Auschwitz on 19 August 1942.

The book relates the misadventures of Lewis Romayne, and is also noted for a perceived anti-Catholic bias. Plot summary As the story begins, Romayne and his friend, Major Hynd, are in Boulogne to visit Romayne's aunt, who is dying. While there, Romayne attends a card game, where he has an argument with a corrupt card sharp, the General, who challenges him to a duel. However, the general doesn't turn up himself but nominates his son, an accurate shot, who should win the duel. Romayne absolutely does not want to fight but is goaded into doing so. Against the odds, he accidentally kills his opponent, and the screams of the man's brother after the death come to haunt Romayne for the rest of his life. Romayne returns to his Yorkshire home, called Vange Abbey. Even in his own home, the Frenchman's younger brother's awful cries follow him. He finally leaves for London, to visit his old friend Lord Loring, who is the patriarch of a well-heeled Catholic family. While there, he meets Stella Eyrecourt, who falls in love with him. A Catholic priest named Father Benwell, who serves as a spiritual leader for the Lorings, determines that he will convert Romayne to the church, employing the services of young priest, Arthur Penrose, to this end. This is all done in an attempt to bring Romayne's family home, Vange, back to the church, who owned it before Romayne's family. Romayne, who is still haunted by the duel, sends Major Hynd to enquire about the family of the man he killed in hopes of assisting them monetarily. Additionally, he confides in Penrose who becomes a true friend to Romayne, despite his presumed ulterior motives. Father Benwell employs various tactics to undermine Romayne's marriage to Stella, finally culminating in the revelation of Stella's prior bigamous marriage to Bernard Winterfield. Winterfield had fallen in love with Stella and married her while erroneously believing that his wife from a previous marriage was dead. Eventually, Romayne is promoted to an ecclesiastical post in Paris. However, knowing that he is dying, Romayne finally decides to see Stella and his son. Father Benwell brings Romayne's lawyer to his deathbed, trying to confirm the validity of the will in an attempt to ensure the church inherits Vange. But as he dies, Romayne acknowledges he loves his wife and child, and has the will destroyed. This causes Vange‚Äîand the entire inheritance‚Äîto pass to his family, foiling Benwell's plans. Structure The structure of the book took on a different form than Collins' more well-known novels such as The Moonstone and The Woman in White. The latter novels used a form in which the narrative of the story is dispersed across many narrators. In The Black Robe, Collins chose to use a series of \\"scenes\\" to organize the novel coherently. While it is unclear why he chose to divert so radically from a previously successful structure, he had also done this in a previous novel, No Name. Critical reception Writing for The Spectator, E. A. Collins, who was herself a minor novelist, gave the novel a generally unfavorable review. However oddly enough, she recommended the novel for its \\"readability.\\" The same reviewer complained of an \\"unnaturalness\\" present in the book, and a lack of development of significant characters. Political cartoon showing Collins doing penance for writing The Black Robe. Accusations of anti-Catholic bias In writing the book, Collins has been accused of perpetuating an anti-Catholic bias common in the late 19th century.

As editor at the Washington Daily News he clashed with the chain's management over FDR's court-packing plan; immediately upon his resignation in 1937, FDR telephoned him to recruit his services. It wasn't until 1938 that Mellet took his first government job, as head of the National Emergency Council.* World War two In 1939, Franklin Roosevelt appointed Mellett to head the Office of Government Reports, checking newspapers, polling the public and maintaining information officers throughout the country.* In 1942 this became the Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP).

Printed between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, the invitations invited people to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration as the forty-fourth President of the United States. The invitations have kept the same basic design of a gold seal and black script since the 1949 inauguration of Harry S. Truman, but this invitation was produced in a green manner, using recycled paper, by companies certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Preparations =Design= The invitations have followed the same design since those for Harry S. Truman's presidential inauguration on January 20, 1949. The invitations have a gold embossed inauguration seal at the top of the page and black-inked script using customized Shelley Alegro and Kuenstler typefaces. The invitation reads, \\"The Presidential Inaugural Committee requests the honor of your presence to attend and participate in the Inauguration of Barack H. Obama as President of the United States of America and Joseph R. Biden Jr. as Vice President of the United States of America on Tuesday, the twentieth of January two thousand and nine in the city of Washington.\\" =Printing= The reverse of the seal of Obama's inauguration invitation Ink for the invitations was supplied by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental was selected because it is a union company, uses recycled paper, and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. The printing technique for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression on the front of the page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11√ó17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8¬Ω√ó11 sheets. =Paper= The paper used to print the invitations on initially came from Michigan. Waste paper collected from local companies in Grand Rapids was collected by Louis Padnos Iron & Metal. It was shipped to Wisconsin, where it was turned into pulp. The Whiting Paper Mill, owned by Neenah Paper, another FSC certified company, converted the pulp into CLASSIC CREST Recycled 100 Natural White Papers manufactured by Neenah Paper, which contains FSC certified fibers and is made with 100 percent renewable green energy in a completely carbon-neutral, chlorine-free process. The paper was delivered to Precise by Central National-Gottesman, another FSC certified company. =Mailing= Prompt Mailers of Staten Island, New York mailed the invitations, which also included a letter from the Presidential Inaugural Committee and a leaflet from the inaugural store. Between December 31, 2008, and January 7, 2009, 3,100 to 3,500 envelopes were filled and sealed every hour. Recipients Color-coded assigned entrances and seating areas are noted in official map from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Invitations were sent to the chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses but not to any other representatives of foreign countries. As a result, North Korea's offer to send a senior envoy was rejected. The Tuskegee Airmen were among the invited guests for the inauguration. The five-person crew of US Airways Flight 1549, including pilot Chesley Sullenberger, were also invited. Entertainment industry figures such as Beyonc√©, Jay-Z, Steven Spielberg, Magic Johnson, Dustin Hoffman, Muhammad Ali, John Cusack, and Oprah Winfrey received invitations, as well as politicians such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California; Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy; and Arizona Senator John McCain. The invitation to Evangelical pastor Rick Warren drew some criticism. Eighty- seven-year-old Sarah Obama led a group of Obama's Kenyan relatives from his father's home village of Kogelo. Other relatives traveling to Washington from Kenya as guests included Obama's aunt Maggie Obama and an uncle, Said Obama. Members of the general public also received invitations to the inaugural ceremony.

This was the 19th inauguration and marked the commencement of the first term of Abraham Lincoln as President and the only term of Hannibal Hamlin as Vice President. The presidential oath of office was administered to Lincoln by Roger B. Taney, the Chief Justice of the United States. John C. Breckinridge became the first outgoing vice president to administer the vice-presidential oath of office to his successor. This was the first time Lincoln appeared in public with a beard, which he had begun growing after being elected president, in response to a written request by 11-year-old Grace Bedell. This effectively made him the first President to have any facial hair beyond sideburns. On Inauguration Day, Lincoln's procession to the Capitol was surrounded by heavily armed cavalry and infantry, providing an unprecedented amount of protection for the President- elect as the nation stood on the brink of war. During the weeks between Lincoln's victory in the 1860 presidential election and Inauguration Day, seven slave states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. Train ride to Washington An entourage of family and friends left Springfield, Illinois with Lincoln on February 11 to travel by train to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration. This group including his wife, three sons, and brother-in-law, as well as John G. Nicolay, John M. Hay, Ward Hill Lamon, David Davis, Norman B. Judd, Edwin Vose Sumner, as well as his African-American valet and bodyguard, William Henry Johnson. For the next ten days, he traveled widely throughout the country, with stops in Indianapolis, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, Albany, New York City, and south to Philadelphia, where on the afternoon of February 21, he pulled into Kensington Station. Lincoln took an open carriage to the Continental Hotel, with almost 100,000 spectators waiting to catch a glimpse of the President-elect. There he met Mayor Alexander Henry, and delivered some remarks to the crowd outside from a hotel balcony. Lincoln continued on to Harrisburg. Then, because of an alleged assassination conspiracy, Lincoln traveled through Baltimore, Maryland on a special train in the middle of the night transferring from the President Street Station to the Camden Station at 3:30 a.m., The Thwarted Plot to Kill Lincoln on the Streets of Baltimore, Boundary Stones, WETA's Washington DC History BlogThe Unsuccessful Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln, Smithsonian magazine, Daniel StashowerThe Baltimore Plot, The First Conspiracy to Assassinate Abraham Lincoln, Michael J.

The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), the primary American modern-Orthodox rabbinic association, initially took exception to his presence, stating that, \\"participation in a prayer service held in the sanctuary of a church is prohibited\\", and adding: \\"Any member of the RCA who attends such a service does so in contravention of this policy and should not be perceived as representing the organization in any capacity.\\"Grossman, Cathy Lynn. \\"Rabbi chided for role in a church service for Obama,\\" USA Today, January 21, 2009.

Accessed October 13, 2015. =Jewish conversions= A woman who was converted to Judaism by Lookstein was refused recognition as a Jew by an Israeli Rabbinical Court in Petah Tikva, Israel, part of an international controversy over just who outside of the official Israeli Rabbinate will have their conversions recognized in Israel. The controversy gained a significantly higher profile because Lookstein also converted Ivanka Trump, daughter of Donald Trump, prior to her 2009 marriage to Jared Kushner. It seemed that officials of the Israeli government, which \\"has traditionally not accepted conversions done in liberal streams of Judaism\\", were indirectly casting aspersion on Ivanka Trump's conversion. The rejection of conversions performed by Lookstein was condemned by the Jewish Agency for Israel, the large international NGO \\"responsible for the immigration ... and absorption of Jews and their families from the Diaspora into Israel\\". =RNC invocation= In July 2016, Lookstein accepted the invitation of Ivanka Trump, a member of his congregation, to offer the opening invocation at the 2016 Republican National Convention. After the invitation was made public, many Kehilath Jeshurun congregants as well as Ramaz alumni signed a petition requesting Lookstein to refrain from appearing at the RNC, condemning Trump's \\"racist, misogynistic rhetoric\\". Lookstein, responding to the uproar, backtracked, and in an e-mail sent out to the congregants, he explained that he was withdrawing from the RNC \\"in the interest of bringing our community together\\". His prepared remarks, which Lookstein also sent out, included the following benediction: In the aftermath, some argued that the pressure put on Lookstein to withdraw was counterproductive, inferring, from the content of his prepared remarks, a subtle rebuke to then-nominee Trump.

From 1993 until 2014, it was the private residence of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the second son of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.Schackenborg Slot History Originally called M√∏gelt√∏nderhus (M√∏gelt√∏nder House), the former stronghold on the site was the property of the Roman Catholic bishops of Ribe. It served as protection against the Frisians in the south, and guarded the waterway that joined Vid√• to T√∏nder. During the Reformation in Denmark, the mansion was confiscated from the Church by the Danish crown. Count Hans von Schack, a Schleswig nobleman and soldier, was given M√∏gelt√∏nderhus as a token of King Frederick III of Denmark's gratitude for his military achievements in the Northern Wars. Schack demolished most of the mansion in 1661 due to its bad condition, building the more impressive, baroque style \\"Schackenborg Castle\\". In 1680, a street was laid out from the manor house, leading toward the local church. For eleven generations, the castle belonged to the von Schack family before reverting to the Danish Royal Family again in 1978. In 1993, Schackenborg and the extensive estate were transferred to Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger son of Queen Margrethe II. In 1995, it was announced that Prince Joachim and then-Princess Alexandra would finally be moving into the residence. For their wedding, a national collection was made, known as the \\"Nation's Gift\\". Several million Danish kroner were raised. Prince Joachim announced that the money would be spent on a restoration programme for the castle. The castle and the surrounding park are not open to the general public, however guided tours of the gardens are sometimes available during the summer. Since 2014, it has been owned by a foundation and not by any member of the royal family.

The word Srinivas is combination of two Sanskrit words, Shri (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä) and nivasa (‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏). This is the stem form of the word (before case inflections are added) in Sanskrit. Shrinivas is the stem form of the word (before case inflections are added). It is a name for males in India as well as a family surname. Shrinivasan (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç) is the singular nominative form, and along with its variants Srinivasan, Sreenivasan, and others, used as a forename or surname. Etymology Shri means \\"radiance\\" or \\"diffusing light\\"; nivasa means \\"place of residence\\", which is considered to be the source of light (as a metaphor for life) in Hindu scriptures. Shri has also the meaning of Lakshmi who is rendered to be embodied within Venkateswara. Hence the alternative meaning \\"one within whom Lakshmi (prosperity) lives\\". Variants Srinivas is a modernized version of the original Sanskrit/Hindu name Srinivasa. The use of the word Srinivasan (also written as Sreenivasan) instead of Srinivas is common in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Similarly, the dialectical word, Srinivasulu, is commonly used in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The name is also very much prevalent in Orissa, Maharastra and Karnataka, among other parts of India. The other variants in English spelling include Sreenivas, Shrinivas, Shreenivas, Srinibas, Shrinibas. The name Srinivas is also kept for new houses.

She critiqued the works of the Nobel laureate poet Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez as well as of Spanish and Latin American literature, in general. Her academic contributions to the criticism of poetry and poetics, modernismo, memoirs, and the epistolary genre were recognized both nationally and internationally.  Education  Dr. Nemes came to the University of Maryland, College Park in 1946 where she met Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez. Jim√©nez became Nemes' mentor while she undertook language teaching and pursued her master's and doctoral degrees. Dr. Nemes earned her master's degree in 1949 and her doctoral degree in 1952.  Career  Dr. Nemes was a pioneer of teaching language at the University of Maryland, and was an example of the intellectual and educational contributions of Latin American women to the intellectual development of the humanities at the University of Maryland. Nemes began teaching at the University of Maryland in 1953 and remained until her retirement in 1989 as Professor Emerita in the Foreign Languages Department. She continued her role as an educator after retirement, teaching classes and giving lectures at the University of Maryland until 2011. Dr. Nemes nominated Jim√©nez for the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he won in 1956. She became the major critic of Jim√©nez's works and was recognized as such by subsequent generations who benefited from her early work. The in Spain counted her as an honorary member. In 2004, a street in Moguer, Jim√©nez's birthplace, was named in her honor. On the 50th anniversary of Jimen√©z's Nobel Prize, Dr. Nemes was invited to speak at no less than eight major conferences dedicated to Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez and Zenobia Camprub√≠. Dr. Nemes delivered opening and closing plenary lectures throughout Spain, including Madrid, Huelva, Seville, and Moguer.

Directed by John Emerson, the story was written by Tod Browning with intertitles by Anita Loos. A 35 mm print of the film still exists in its entirety and is currently in the public domain.  Overview  In this unusually broad comedy for Fairbanks, the acrobatic leading man plays \\"Coke Ennyday\\", a cocaine-shooting detective who is a parody of Sherlock Holmes. Ennyday is given to injecting himself from a bandolier of syringes worn across his chest, and liberally helps himself to the contents of a hatbox-sized round container of white powder labeled \\"COCAINE\\" on his desk. The Mystery of the Leaping Fish Fairbanks' character otherwise lampoons Sherlock Holmes with checkered detective hat, clothes and even car, along with the aforementioned propensity for injecting cocaine whenever he feels momentarily down, then laughing with delight. A device used for observing visitors, which is referred to in the title cards as his \\"scientific periscope\\", bears a close resemblance to a modern closed-circuit television. What is apparently a clock face has \\"EATS, DRINKS, SLEEPS, and DOPE\\" instead of numbers. The film displays a lighthearted and comic attitude toward Coke Ennyday's use of cocaine and laudanum. While he catches a gang of drug smugglers, he stops them only after sampling their opium.  Cast  * Douglas Fairbanks as Coke Ennyday/Himself * Bessie Love as the little fish blower * Alma Rubens as his female accomplice * Allan Sears as Gent Rolling in Wealth (credited as A.D. Sears) * Charles Stevens as Japanese Accomplice * Tom Wilson as Police Chief I.M. Keene * George Hall as Japanese accomplice (uncredited) * William Lowery as gang leader (uncredited) * Joe Murphy as footman on vehicle (uncredited) * B.F. Zeidman as scenario editor (uncredited)  Themes  The Mystery of the Leaping Fish was released in 1916, the first year after the Harrison Act took effect. Narcotic prohibition was still a new concept in the United States, and the use of opiates and cocaine was much more socially acceptable than today. Furthermore, the censorious Hays Code would not be instituted for another fourteen years after the film's release. With the introduction of the code, depictions of intravenous drug use were not shown in major motion pictures. During the era of the Hays Code, films that dealt with controversial topics such as drug use were morality plays that illustrate the degradation that surrounds the use of such drugs.  Production  Running a total of 25 minutes, the film was initially shot by Christy Cabanne, who was later fired from the production. John Emerson was hired and re-shot the film with the help of Tod Browning. When filming in Chinatown, the production was attacked by members of the community, because they had not requested to film in the neighborhood.  Reception  The film was a departure for Fairbanks due to the subject matter and the fact that he generally appeared in feature films, not two-reelers. The Mystery of the Leaping Fish was the second film Fairbanks did with director John Emerson, their first being His Picture in the Papers (released in February 1916) which was a hit. While The Mystery of the Leaping Fish is now considered something of a cult film due its comedic dealings of drug use, Fairbanks hated the film and reportedly wanted to have it withdrawn from circulation. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance describes The Mystery of the Leaping Fish as \\"undoubtedly the most bizarre film Fairbanks made\\" and that the entire scenario is \\"a hallucinogenic odyssey into the absurd....\\"  References  ;Citations ;Works cited *  External links    1916 comedy films 1916 films American black-and-white films American comedy films American films American parody films American silent short films Articles containing video clips Films about cocaine Films about drugs Films directed by Christy Cabanne Films directed by John Emerson Films with screenplays by Anita Loos Surviving American silent films Triangle Film Corporation films ","title":"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish"},{"id":"21196330","text":"Kaffrine Region is a region of Senegal.
