Description The IBA lies on the northern side of the island, between the national capital, Dili, and the town of Manatuto. In elevation it ranges from sea level to about 1300 m. It comprises a range of steep hills, peaking at Mount Curi, covered by eucalypt savanna woodland with an understorey of mainly Themeda and Heteropogon grasses. The woodland is dominated by Eucalyptus alba at the lower levels and Eucalyptus urophylla above 400 m. Relatively small patches of tropical dry forest or semi-evergreen forest occur in sheltered areas. The grassland is burnt regularly (at intervals of 1‚Äì3 years) and the area is used for shifting cultivation. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, pink-headed imperial pigeons, olive- headed lorikeets, flame-eared honeyeaters, streak-breasted honeyeaters, Timor friarbirds, black-breasted myzomelas, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, green figbirds, olive-brown orioles, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds and Timor sparrows.

Making his professional debut in 2008, he reached the komusubi rank in 2014. He is the younger brother of fellow professional sumo wrestler Chiyomaru. Early life and sumo background As a youngster and student, Kinoshita was active in swimming and also judo, in which he has a black belt. However, he also participated in sumo less regularly, and in his sixth year of primary school he reached the best sixteen in a national children's amateur sumo tournament. He had visited a Kokonoe stable event in Ky≈´sh≈´ in his primary school years, and his older brother Chiyomaru was already a wrestler with the stable, so upon his graduation from middle school an invitation was arranged through intermediaries and he joined his brother as a member of this stable. Career He joined Kokonoe stable in May 2008. He did well from this period, recording all winning tournaments. However, in November of this year he suffered a cruciate ligaments rupture. This serious injury forced him to miss most of the next several tournaments, but he was back in full form by the July 2009 tournament. He was back to his winning ways and after a 6‚Äì1 in his first tournament back in the jonokuchi division, he took the championship in the following September 2009 tournament in jonidan with a 7‚Äì0 perfect record. It is a tradition that Kokonoe wrestlers adopt a ring name on their promotion to sandanme division. Kinoshita did this, and also following the additional Kokonoe tradition that its wrestler's ring names begin with Chiyo, he took the ring name of Chiyo≈çtori. He would struggle for a year and a half in sandanme but on his promotion to the third division makushita in January 2011 he found his stride, taking mostly winning tournaments. In November 2011 in the tournament in his home prefecture of Ky≈´sh≈´, he had a 6‚Äì1 record and participated in a three-man playoff for the championship, losing only in the very last playoff match to rival Sensh≈ç. In the subsequent January 2012 tournament, he would repeat exactly the same feat, a 3-man makushita playoff, only losing the final bout to future top division wrestler J≈çk≈çry≈´, then known as Sakumayama. Though he lost both playoffs, these two tournament records and playoffs were more than enough to propel him into the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç for the March 2012 tournament. He was the first wrestler since the former Wakanoh≈ç in the November 2006 to achieve j≈´ry≈ç promotion in his teens. He spent a little over a year in j≈´ry≈ç, alternating winning and losing tournaments, including the November 2012 tournament where he had to drop out due to injury after logging 7 wins. He bounced back from injury and achieved two 10‚Äì5 records in the January and March tournaments of 2013. His first promotion to the top division makuuchi in May 2013 would be short lived, as he managed only a 6‚Äì9 record at maegashira 14 and was relegated back to j≈´ry≈ç. He would soon find his footing again, and in his third tournament back in j≈´ry≈ç in November 2013, he took the championship at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 2. Chiyo≈çtori was promoted to makuuchi for the second time in the subsequent January 2014 tournament. Coincidentally this was the same tournament that his older brother Chiyomaru would win the j≈´ry≈ç championship. An impressive record of 10‚Äì5 at maegashira 12 would elevate him to the rank of maegashira 5 for following March 2014 tournament, the same tournament at which Chiyomaru would get his own first promotion to the top division. In this tournament Chiyo≈çtori received a 9‚Äì6 record guaranteeing promotion to a higher rank and Chiyomaru would receive an 8‚Äì7 in his debut. This was the first time that two brothers had both been in makuuchi at the same time since May 2008, and the first time brothers had both achieved winning records in makuuchi since May 2007. In the following tournament, Chiyo≈çtori made his san'yaku debut at the komusubi rank. He managed a 5‚Äì10 rank and though this would lead to a demotion, it is actually considered a decent record by many for a debut at such a challenging rank: komusubi are usually expected to be matched against all the higher ranked san'yaku wrestlers. He defeated newly promoted yokozuna Kakury≈´ on the seventh day, his first victory over a yokozuna, but did not get a kinboshi for the win as these are only awarded to maegashira ranked wrestlers. He was injured during the May 2015 tournament and had to withdraw, resulting in demotion to j≈´ry≈ç. After a 9‚Äì6 record in July, he returned to the top division for the September 2015 tournament. He slowly moved up the rankings and had reached maegashira 4 by September 2016, but withdrew with a recurrence of an old knee injury on Day 11, having already lost nine of his first ten bouts. He was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç after the January 2017 tournament. In the following March tournament in Osaka he dislocated his shoulder on the sixth day and withdrew from competition. After three consecutive scores of 7‚Äì8 he missed the November 2017 tournament with his medical certificate citing a right shoulder dislocation and an anterior cruciate ligament injury to his left knee. The January 2018 tournament saw Chiyo≈çtori ranked in makushita for the first time in six years, and he withdrew from the tournament having failed to recover sufficiently from his injuries. In the March 2018 tournament he scored only 3‚Äì4 from makushita 49, his tenth consecutive make-koshi or losing score, meaning he fell from maegashira 4 to sandanme division in less than two years. However, he finally reversed course with two consecutive 5‚Äì2 records in the May and July 2018 tournaments followed by two more winning tournaments to close out 2018. He produced a 4‚Äì3 record at the rank of Makushita 1 West in November 2019, which returned him to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time in two years. In March 2020 he achieved his first kachi-koshi as a sekitori since July 2016. He is the owner of the Sanoyama toshiyori kabu or elder stock, indicating he intends to stay in sumo as a coach upon his retirement. Fighting style Like his brother, Chiyo≈çtori favours pushing and thrusting techniques (tsuki/oshi) over those that involve grabbing the opponent's mawashi or belt. Yori-kiri (force out) and oshi-dashi (push out), the two most common kimarite in sumo, account for sixty percent of his career wins.

TaR represents certain quantile for a given probability distribution, so is similar to Value at Risk (VaR). However, TaR measures risk amount as time(time until an adverse event) rather than value (loss amount).  Definition and examples  Mathematical definition of TaR is same as that of VaR. However, value-based random variable is replaced with time-based one, and given time-horizon is replaced with given finance structure. Examples comparing VaR and TaR are as below. *‚ÄúAn insurance company's 90% VaR is 10 million dollars for 1-year insurance risk.‚Äù : This means it is 90% probability that insurance claim payout would be below 10 million dollars; so if the insurer has accumulated 10 million dollars in cash, it would be 90% safe. *‚ÄúAn insurance company's 90% TaR is 3 years for liquidity risk under current finance structure.‚Äù : This means it is 90% probability that net liquid assets(= liquid assets - volatile liabilities) would not be run out within 3 years; so for 3 years, the insurer under current finance structure would be 90% safe. For confidence level Œ±, * VaR can be interpreted as ‚ÄúRequired minimum capital to sustain loss‚Äù * TaR can be interpreted as ‚ÄúMaximum period of time that an adverse event would not occur or would be prevented (ie. safe against the event)‚Äù Thus for same Œ±, lower VaR means lower risk and higher TaR means lower risk.  Applications  TaR is a simple measure for whom are familiar with VaR, so is easy to communicate by. TaR also can be used for supplementary purpose to VaR analysis. Applying TaR in financial models, practitioners can analyze sources of risks and take remedial actions in corporate finance planning; not only for liquidity risk mentioned above, but also for any risks that demands time-based analysis. When TaR is applied to a household's financial planning it can measure longevity risk, and TaR in this case is referred to as Age at Risk (AaR).

In 1859 Collins made a drawing of the Tree of Comfort with a vision for a Gift from Mother Ann to Eldress Eunice. The period where spiritual visions were captured in song or drawings, called the Era of Manifestations, was also called the \\"period of Mother's work\\", referring to Mother Ann Lee, whose departed spirit was believed to have passed messages to the Skaker \\"instruments\\" who believed and received such messages. This work was a variation of the common Shaker motif Tree of Life, such as the depictions made by Hannah Cohoon. It was one of Collin's most notable and recognizable works.

History In July 19, 1897 a group of men form Peace Lutheran Church of Friedenberg, Missouri, met in the home of Fred Schade for the purpose of organizing a congregation. Peace Lutheran Congregation in Friedenberg maintained a Christian day school for all of their children. The children of the families living in Longtown and vicinity walked every day to the school in Friedenberg. During the winter months and early spring the roads often became impassable. Due to the distance and high absence of Longtown pupils during times of bad weather, it was decided to establish a new congregation in Longtown. Under the leadership of Reverend O. R Hueschen of Uniontown, the founding members adopted a constitution and decided upon the name of ‚ÄòZion Evangelical Lutheran Church of Longtown‚Äô. Fifteen members signed the church‚Äôs constitution. At first, Devine Services were held in a building that had originally served as a Baptist church. Hueschen served as a temporary pastor until the new congregation‚Äôs first pastor, G. D. Hamm, was installed on September 12, 1897. The congregation grew in the first year to 133 members. The cornerstone of a new brick building was laid on June 23, 1912, with the church being dedicated on November 3, 1912. The church came at a cost of $8,000. The building was 42 feet by 70 feet, and included in the cost were the altar pulpit baptismal font, bell, pews and furnace.

The Quartier Asiatique (Asian Quarter), also called Triangle de Choisy or Petite Asie, is the largest commercial and cultural center for the Asian community of Paris. It is located in the southeast of the 13th arrondissement in an area that contains many high-rise apartment buildings. Despite its status as a \\"Chinatown\\", the neighborhood also contains significant Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian populations.  History  The first wave of Asian immigrants to the neighborhood consisted of ethnic Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War during the late 1970s. Later waves of migrants consisted of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, who also fled their countries following their communist takeovers and to avoid persecution by the new governments. A significant number of the earlier Vietnamese immigrants integrated into French society shortly after their arrival, and began moving to other areas of Paris and the surrounding √éle-de-France region, while still maintaining a commercial presence in the area.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) This left the neighborhood having a larger ethnic Chinese presence, and thus led to a creation of the present-day \\"Chinatown\\".  Neighborhood  The Quartier Asiatique forms an area roughly the shape of a triangle bounded by Avenue de Choisy, Avenue d'Ivry and Boulevard Mass√©na, as well as the Les Olympiades complex. Within this neighborhood, commercial activity is dominated by Chinese and Vietnamese businesses, with a smaller number of Laotian and Cambodian establishments. The large French Asian specialty market chains of Tang Fr√®res and Paristore also have their flagship locations within the quarter. As the focal point for the Asian population of the √éle-de-France region, a number of community organizations are headquartered here, helping to serve immigrant needs and cultural activities, especially for those from the former French Indochina. The annual Lunar New Year parade within the neighborhood is largest in Paris. Unlike other Chinatowns in the Western world, Chinese architecture is not highly visible in the area, with an exception being the several Buddhist temples located throughout the district.  Demographics  The Quartier Asiatique is the largest Chinatown in Europe, and unlike the diminutive but well-known Chinese district around Gerrard Street in London's Soho, it represents a significant population center as the result of very considerable immigration. The area is populated by nearly 50,000 people, largely of Chinese, Vietnamese and Laotian descent. Originally an ethnic Vietnamese quarter, the Asian population in the area diversified in the 1980s as other ethnic groups from Indochina also settled in the district, the largest group being ethnic Chinese. While a large proportion of the neighborhood's earlier Vietnamese population assimilated into French society and moved to other areas of Paris, they still maintain a strong commercial and cultural presence in the district. Languages used among immigrant groups in the community include the Cantonese and Teochew dialects of the Chinese language, as well as Vietnamese, Lao and Khmer. Ethnic Chinese refugees are often conversant in one of the latter three languages in addition to their native Chinese dialect, due to their origins from Indochina.  Similar communities  Paris also hosts three other Asiatic districts within its limits. The most notable is that of the Belleville neighborhood in the 20th arrondissement. Unlike Chinatown and the 13th arrondissement, ethnic Chinese from Indochina form a minority of the neighborhood's overall and Asian population. Ethnic groups from Indochina also do not have a significant presence in the Belleville community. Instead, the vast majority of Belleville's ethnic Chinese population consists of those with origins from the eastern Chinese coastal city of Wenzhou and surrounding southern Zhejiang province.Belleville: un m√©lange pas si explosive, June 2010 (in French) Meanwhile, the oldest but smallest Asian neighborhood in Paris is located in the 3rd arrondissement, near the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers. It is bounded roughly by , Rue Volta, Rue du Temple and Rue des Gravilliers. The district was established in the early 1900s, when Chinese migrants specializing in the leather and Chinese porcelain industries arrived in Paris from the Wenzhou region. During World War I, a large number of Chinese laborers, also principally from Wenzhou, were recruited by the French Empire to help with war efforts in the country. The small number who decided to stay in France after the war also settled in the district.Le Quartier Chinois de Paris Arts-et- M√©tiers (in French) SInce the 1990s, a Japanese quarter has been developing along Rue Sainte-Anne in the 1st arrondissement near the Pyramides M√©tro station. The area hosts a number of Japanese restaurants and specialty boutiques, along with branch offices of the Japan National Tourism Organization and Japan Airlines. In recent years, a Korean presence has also been established in the same area.  Gallery  Image:Paris-macdo.jpgMix of culture in the Triangle de Choisy.

The reconstructed building was designed in the Commercial style, which was popular in Midwestern cities during the period. The three-story brick building uses stone for its ornamentation, providing contrast with the darker brick. The second and third floors of the front facade, as well as the attic windows, are surrounded by a stone border. Brick piers separate the four bays within the surround; arrow-shaped decorations top the piers. The building's name plate, located at the top of the surround, features a reeded torus molding and guttae along its bottom. A gabled parapet at the top of the front elevation hides the flat roof.

Name York Chapel took its name from one of the earliest circuit riders of this district. History In 1821, a colony came to what is now York Chapel Community. The Abernathys, Farrars, Rutledges and Burns were among the first pioneers. The religious leader serving the colony was Jones Abernathy. The church is the second oldest Methodist organization in the Louisiana Purchase. In 1826, the first church, a log church, was built on the right side of the cemetery. The first church also served as a school for the congregation‚Äôs children. On the 5th day of September, 1837, George Rutledge, deeded 40 acres to Jeremiah Abernathy, William Farrar, George Rutledge, Lot Abernathy, John N. Abernathy, James Burns, and Alonzo Abernathy, for the purpose of building a church for the members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Ezekiel Foster also deeded 4 acres, while John H. Abernathy deeded one acre.York Chapel Methodist Church and Cemetery, Perry County Historical Society, Book committee, 2009 www.perrycountyhistoricalsociety.org The congregation decided to replace the log church with a more permanent structure, and in 1843 the construction on the ‚ÄòRock Church‚Äô was begun, with its name deriving from the limestone used to build the structure. In 1844, construction on the Rock Church was finished, and the congregation continued to worship there for 70 years until 1914 when a new structure of brick and stone was erected near the spot of the old camp- meeting tabernacle. The present brick and stone church building was dedicated by Reverend W. F. McMurry.

Club career =Early career= Mikel Agu started his career with grassroots team Megapp FC in Nigeria. He took part in the 2009 Copa Coca-Cola, where he was chosen as the best player of the tournament, attracting the interest of scouts. After the tournament, Agu joined the youth academy of Porto. = Porto = Agu was first signed under the Porto-U 19 setup training with the senior team with the occasional bench appearance. His development would see him play 2 seasons for Porto B before eventually getting an opportunity to play for the first team. Agu made his debut against Gil Vicente in a 2-1 win coming as a substitute for Josu√©. Doing so, he became the first Nigerian to play for the club. Following his wonderful performance in Porto B, the then manager Paulo Fonseca promoted him to the main team. He would then be sent on loan to gain experience playing in the first division.  Porto B  Seeking playing opportunities at Porto, Agu was deployed mostly in the Porto B team, with whom he made 69 league appearances between 2012 and 2016. He completed over 30 appearances in each of the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons.  Club Brugge (loan)  At the start of 2015/2016 season, after making one appearance for Porto B, he went on loan to Club Brugge in the Belgian Jupiler league. He made just two league appearances as Brugge finished the season as league champions.  Vitoria Setubal (loan)  Agu was loaned back to the Portuguese league for the 2016-2017 season, which served somewhat as a breakout season for him. He made 27 league appearances, starting 25 times; and 34 total appearances in all competitions for Vit√≥ria Set√∫bal He played a part as they made a run to the semi-final in the Ta√ßa da Liga. His much improved game-play ensured that he was finally recognized as a top player within his own right. His performances were also noticed by his country's national team, leading to a call-up in 2017. This decision was made that he would be recalled to the Porto first team at the end of the season. =Bursaspor (loan) = In August 2017 Agu joined Turkish side Bursaspor on a season-long loan deal.https://www.goal.com/en- ng/amp/news/official-mikel-agu-joins-bursaspor-on- loan/a1nd7ft72vlm19a7i5sur4yvm International career He was selected by Nigeria for their 35-man provisional squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Agu made his senior debut for Nigeria in a 3-0 friendly win over Togo on 1 June 2017. In May 2018 he was named in Nigeria‚Äôs preliminary 30 man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every- world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb However, he did not make the final 23.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/44346451 Style of Play Agu's style of play can be likened to former Chelsea player John Obi Mikel. He received the nickname \\"Mikel\\" from fans in Benin City, where he grew up, due to similarities in movement and overall play. He has an excellent close- control and has shown a very good passing range, complementing this with the vision to play long balls from the back. On occasion, he has shown the ability to control the tempo of the game. Defensively, he shows good anticipation and does not rush into his tackles, positioning himself just in front of the back four.

The original name, Frieden Evangelical Lutheran Church of Friedenberg, followed the German tradition of using the word \\"Evangelical\\", meaning Protestant, as part of the name. The name Frieden is German for 'Peace'. History The Bavarian immigrants who came in the summer of 1838, before the arrival of the Saxon Lutheran immigrants, worshiped in members' homes until a log church was built north of Cinque Hommes Creek in 1846, in a location known as Frankenberg or Hill of the Franks in German. Rev. C. F. Gruber of the Saxon Paitzdorf colony (present-day Uniontown) first served the congregation beginning in 1840. From 1852 to 1885, the congregation worshiped in a church on the Frankenberg hill overlooking Cinque Hommes bottom. Peace Lutheran Cemetery is still located at this site along Highway 61. The congregation's membership extended from Perryville all the way to the Mississippi River opposite Chester, Illinois. Peace thus became the \\"mother church\\" of Immanuel in Perryville, Zion in Crosstown, Zion in Longtown, and a congregation at Point Rest that no longer exists. It also helped Lutherans at Ste. Genevieve organize a congregation 1867. In 1885, the congregation moved from Frankenberg to Friedenberg and built the present red-brick structure. As the social and economic climate of the area changed, membership began to decline. In 1980 Peace congregation voted to disband.

Plot =Opening Sequence= Rapunzel's tower is featured in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest nine months prior to the new curse, Charming hears someone crying in the nursery, and sees Emma Swan wearing a gown that she plans to wear to her ball with her father. But as they start to dance the room starts to turn dark and the magical tree wardrobe starts to suck Emma into its portal, which wakes Charming up from his nightmare, but this time he and Snow White are back in the fortress, where Snow tells her husband that they are expecting another child. The news of Snow's pregnancy leaves Charming with mixed feelings, prompting him to seek advice from Robin Hood, who suggests that he should look for a mystical herb called nightroot to help him calm down. Later on the next day as he starts chopping the root in the forest, Charming hears a woman screaming from a nearby tower, and notices a rope of long black hair which is revealed to belong to Rapunzel. She says she‚Äôs a king‚Äôs daughter who was also trying to seek out the nightroot in order to calm her nightmares after her brother died, but then tells him that the nightroot didn‚Äôt work. Unbeknownst to the two individuals, a cloaked stranger arrives and climbs the tower. The mysterious person is revealed to be the exact double of Rapunzel, who is trying to steal her courage. As Rapunzel is lured into her fears, Charming tells her to fight back and face it, even as he almost loses his grip on her hair. He then insists that the only way to end the fears is by cutting them off and escaping the tower. The psychology works, and the hooded individual disappears after Rapunzel slices off her hair, allowing her to escape the tower. She then thanks Charming for helping her, saying that she was afraid to go home because of her brother's death, as he died trying to save her from drowning in a nearby creek. As Charming returns to the palace to reunite Rapunzel with her family, he confesses to Snow that he was afraid that he lost Emma twice. =In Storybrooke= Flash forward nine months later to present-day Storybrooke, where Emma, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, and Hook try to come up a plan to expose The Wicked Witch of The West. As they begin their search, Regina tells the others that she'll stay and keep Henry company. At the farm house cellar, Zelena takes care of her prisoner Rumplestiltskin, who has gone insane inside the cage. Zelena starts shaving Rumplestiltskin with his Dagger when she accidentally makes a cut, then apologizes sarcastically. She later visits the pawn shop, where she tells Belle that she is looking for a gift to give to a baby, tricks Belle by freezing her with a green glow and immediately takes the nightroot that was kept in a jar inside the safe (using Rumplestiltskin's nicked blood). At Regina's office, Emma, Hook, and David search for clues, when David recognizes a berry that he had seen once before in the forest. He then receives a text message from Mary Margaret that the new midwife has stopped by and wants to meet him. As he arrives back to the apartment, Zelena is making tea for the Charmings, but David is very suspicious about Zelena, even after Mary Margaret tells him that Zelena was once friends with her late nanny Johanna. Unbeknownst to the two, Zelena is spiking one of the teas with the nightroot and after she returns to join in the conversation, Zelena asks David if he has any fears about Mary Margaret's pregnancy. David says no and takes a drink from the cup with the nightroot. As David later leaves the apartment and drives off, he begins to feel unnerved after he sees what appears to be a hooded individual in the road and texts Emma that he might have seen the Witch. In between these events, Regina tries to bond with Henry at the park, where he tells Regina about Walsh, saying it was odd that his mother took him out of school to go to Maine two days after the proposal, noting that ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be here if she said yes.‚Äù Meanwhile in the forest, Hook discovers the berries that David recognized from Regina's office, but Emma suspects that Hook isn't telling her the truth about the past year. However, Hook says that he was glad that Walsh broke Emma's heart, saying that if her heart can be broken, it means it still works. As the two arrive at the farm house, they discover the cellar and investigate. Emma receives a message that David found the Witch in the forest, only for him to stab the individual, who turns out to be an exact double of David, who stares the real David down and drains him dry during their duel. The latter then sees Emma's car, prompting him to face his fears of being a father, vowing never to give in to fear. The double then disappears before Emma, Regina, and Hook arrive, where they find the cellar and the cage empty, the only clue left being a spinning wheel, indicating that she has Rumplestiltskin. Regina tells David that the doppelg√§nger he was fighting with might be toying with them, but he doesn't remember anything about the previous encounter (when he saved Rapunzel from the individual). Regina believes that Zelena taking David's sword means that she's taken a part of his courage, or at least a symbol of it. Cultural References *Regina makes a reference to Nancy Drew in response to Emma's detective work. *More Wizard Of Oz references can be found in the kitchen stove and the bicycle that bear a resemblance to the items in the 1939 film. *Goblins with a Shrek face are engraved in the decorations on the wall of Rapunzel's tower Reception =Ratings= Due to CBS' broadcast of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament that ran overtime and altered that network's schedule, the outing saw a three percent drop from the previous episode, placing a 2.1/6 among 18-49s with only 6.91 million tuning in, but still won its time slot despite the setback.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Believe', 'Once Upon a Time', 'Crisis' & 'Resurrection' Slide + 'American Dream Builders' Premieres Low\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (March 24, 2014) =Critical reception= The episode was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics noticing the series taking a serious darker tone this time around, while a few thought the Rapunzel storyline was weak. Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave it a good review: \\"Tonight's episode of Once was a lengthy meditation on fear that culminated in wicked Zelena getting her once- green mitts on a very special magical item: Prince Charming's courage, or at least \\"a symbol of it,\\" according to Regina. So far, there don't seem to be any immediate consequences to what just happened; it's not as though David immediately turned into a sniveling coward once his courage was gone. We can, however, infer that the Witch is on some kind of Wizard of Oz-inspired collecting spree‚Äîone that, more likely than not, will find her looking to gather up a (symbolic) heart and brain to go with her newfound courage. Given her interest in Charming's wife, as well as the show's historical interest in what's beating within the princess's chest, it stands to reason that Snow's heart may be next on Zelena's list. (Think a cow as white as milk and a cape as red as blood also made it in?)\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: Fear Itself\\" from Entertainment Weekly (March 23, 2014) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a 6.7 out of 10, mostly due to the lack of character study in the Rapunzel storyline, calling it \\"Lame\\" and \\"Dull.\\" Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.3 out of 5 stars. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, noting that \\"'Once Upon A Time' goes the encapsulated episode route this week with ‚ÄúThe Tower,‚Äù a look at defeating your fear, told from the perspective of Charming. Although he‚Äôs probably not the greatest character to devote an entire episode to, Charming‚Äôs internal journey here offers some nice opportunities for Josh Dallas, unshackled by Snow for once. And at least in ‚ÄúThe Tower‚Äù our fairy-tale-of-the-week is introduced, has a nice twist, accomplishes some resolution, and now there‚Äôs no reason for us ever to see her again. Unlike characters who get their explanatory episodes and then are pretty much left hanging, like Ariel and Cinderella and the still-missing Tinkerbell.\\" References External links  Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 3) episodes ","title":"The Tower (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"42292506","text":"Sweet Alibis is a 2014 Taiwanese comedy film starring Alec Su as a cowardly veteran cop and Ariel Lin as an overzealous rookie.

The upper jaw is protrusible and the mouth contains several rows of small teeth. The single dorsal fin has eleven spines and twelve soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and nine or ten soft rays. There are sixty-eight to seventy scales on the lateral line. This fish is blue-grey above with silvery sides and a scattering of small dark spots. There is usually one large dark blotch above the tip of the pectoral fin. Spicara maena is a rather variable species. It has many synonyms across its wide range and is often confused with the common picarel Spicara smaris. Distribution and habitat Spicara maena is found in the Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Its Atlantic range extends from Morocco and the Canary Islands northwards to Portugal. Its depth range is about . It lives near the seabed over sandy and muddy bottoms and in seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows. Biology Several Spicara maena Spicara maena is a gregarious fish that moves in schools and feeds on small benthic invertebrates and zooplankton. It is a protogynous hermaphrodite, starting life as a female and later changing into a male. In a study in the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir in the Aegean Sea by Soykan and colleagues it was found that there are almost five times as many females as males and that the change of sex on average takes place within the length range and that all fish longer than are male. A study off the eastern central coast of the Adriatic Sea by Dulƒçiƒá and colleagues found that the sex conversion on average happened between and that any fish longer than were male. The females become mature at the age of two years and spawning takes place between March and June in the Aegean, and between August and October further west in the Mediterranean. The male digs a hollow on the seabed and the female lays eggs with a sticky surface in this nest.

Her unmarried name was Anne Caldwell, and from 1817 when she married Arthur Cuthbert Marsh, to 1858, she was known as Anne Marsh. Anne Marsh-Caldwell, 1836 portrait Life She was the third daughter and fourth child of James Caldwell, J.P., of Linley Wood, Staffordshire, who was recorder of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and deputy-lieutenant of the county; her mother was Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Stamford of Derby. In July 1817 she married Arthur Cuthbert Marsh, latterly of Eastbury Lodge, Hertfordshire. She was a long-standing friend of the family of Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery manufacturer, and an acquaintance of Charles Darwin and his wife Emma (n√©e Wedgwood). On the death of her brother, James Stamford Caldwell, in 1858, Anne Marsh succeeded to the estate of Linley Wood, and resumed by royal licence the surname of Caldwell in addition to that of Marsh. She died at Linley Wood, 5 October 1874. Works Anne Marsh was one of the most popular British novelists, for nearly a quarter of a century. Her first book, Two Old Men's Tales, was made up of two stories, The Deformed and The Admiral's Daughter. It was published at the suggestion of Harriet Martineau. Recognised as didactic in character, her books were published anonymously and mainly describe life in the upper middle class and the lower ranks of the aristocracy. They include the following: *Two Old Men's Tales, 1834. *Tales of the Woods and Fields, 1838. *Triumphs of Time, 1844. *Aubrey, 1845. *Mount Sorel, 1845. *Father Darcy, an Historical Romance, 1846. *Emilia Wyndham, 1846, *Norman's Bridge, or the Modern Midas, 1847. *Angela, or the Captain's Daughter, 1848. *The Previsions of Lady Evelyn. *Mordaunt Hall, 1849. *The Wilmingtons, 1849. *Lettice Arnold, 1850. *Time the Avenger, 1851. *Ravenscliffe, 1851. *Castle Avon, 1852. *The Heiress of Haughton, 1856. *Evelyn Marston, 1856. *The Rose of Ashurst, 1867. Many of these works passed through several editions. A collection of them, in 15 volumes, was published in Thomas Hodgson's Parlour Library, 1857. Marsh wrote also The Protestant Reformation in France and the Huguenots (1847), and a translation of the Song of Roland, as chanted before the Battle of Hastings by the minstrel Taillefer (1854). Marsh has been wrongly credited with novels written by Julia Cecilia Stretton (1812‚Äì1878), such as Margaret and her Bridesmaids. Family Her husband Arthur Cuthbert Marsh (died 23 December 1849) was son of William Marsh, senior and sleeping partner in the London banking firm of Marsh, Stacey, & Graham; the bank was ruined in 1824 by Henry Fauntleroy, a junior partner. There were eight children of the marriage, two sons and six daughters. The sons were: *Arthur, born 1824, died young. *Martin William James, died 1846 in Athens at age 20. The daughters were: *Eliza Louisa *Frances Mary, married 1846 to Richard Crofton of the Royal Artillery *Georgina Amelia *Rosamond Jane *Mary Emma, married 1853 to Leopold George Heath R.N. *Hannah Adelaide (died 1859), married 1853 to the Rev.

This weapon was featured in the American bladesmthing competition, Forged in Fire (TV series)'s season 3 episode 9.  Description  The Pandat has a short, heavy, single-edge blade with an iron hilt. It has no real handle, but a short cross-piece of iron or bone passes through the handle. The sword is handled with one or two hands, with a downward stroke. Its blade and hilt are forged from one piece and the blade is bent, just before the hilt, at an angle of 25 degrees. The bend in the blade is located in the transitional part between the blade and the hilt. Both the back and the edge are straight and run apart, so that the blade's broadest part is at the point. The blade length is generally between and the handle is about long. The sheath is usually made of wood and decorated with traditional patterns. It may be decorated with feathers or tufts of hair or simply painted red.  Use  It is thought that a downward cut would be highly inefficient and unbalanced, throwing a great strain upon the wrist. Pandat are well balanced for upward cut, but this would perhaps not be a very effective form of attack.

They are mostly found in southern Chinese cities. In Hong Kong =History= Before 1940s Back in the 1930s, herbal tea shops were not popular. There were only a limited number of street vendors that sold herbal tea on the street. 1940s to Early 1960s In the 1940s, the popularity of herbal tea grew as the public realised the efficacy of herbal tea brought was higher. From then onwards, shops that only sold herbal tea opened in residential areas with a small floor area and gained in popularity in the whole of Hong Kong. Their primary source of customers was residents who lived nearby, and the owners or staff usually had an intimate relationship with their customers. Until the late 1960s, herbal tea shops acted as a semi-public space where the public could go for entertainment. As there were jukeboxes in the shops, it was common for the public to spend their leisure time in the shop socializing with friends or simply enjoying the music and the atmosphere. Apart from this development, some of the shops opened near cinemas so they could attract cinema-goers with their snacks such as fish balls. Late 1960s to 1970s In the late 1960s, philosophical ideas like modernism and scientism were promoted in Hong Kong. This occurrence prompted the construction of a new metropolitan Hong Kong identity. Since the herbal tea shops were deemed as a symbol of traditional Chineseness, they were abandoned for the sake of establishing a city of modernity and internationality. During the 1970s, the herbal tea shops gradually lost their role in social integration. As a result of the alleviated housing problems, the public‚Äôs need for public space like herbal tea shops was reduced. Consequently, the number of herbal tea shops began to decrease significantly from the late 1960s to the 1970s. Late 1980s to 1990s A wave of nostalgic swept Hong Kong from the 1980s to 1990s due to the public‚Äôs anticipation of the handover. During this period of time, many herbal tea shops opened to satisfy the demand. The shops acted as a bridge connecting Hong Kong people to their Hong Kong identity and helped them to cope with their identity crisis.Evans, G., & Tam, M. (Eds.). (1997). HONG KONG The Anthropology of a Chinese Metropolis. University of Hawai'i Press, Hawai'i. . 2000s and onwards =Intangible Cultural Heritage= In 2006, the herbal tea shops regained their popularity after the inclusion of herbal tea formulas and shop brands in the Intangible Cultural Heritage list. According to UNESCO, Intangible Cultural Heritage is a counterpart of World Heritage that focuses on the intangible aspect of culture. Herbal tea meets the four requirements of traditional, contemporary, representative and community-based. The two selection criteria of the formulas are that they must have more than eighty years of history and be passed on continuously with strict protective measures. The formulas selected are then allowed to be called ‚Äúherbal tea‚Äù. Nineteen herbal tea shop brands were also included in the list and some of them are located in Hong Kong. =Modernisation= Due to the change in public‚Äôs taste and habits, herbal tea shops have to include other snacks and drinks in their menus to diversify their products. The modernized shops tend to sell products like desserts, snacks, fruit juice and so on. Many of their products incorporate Chinese medicinal ingredients with Western desserts or snacks, in hopes to modify their business model and cope with the rise of health-consciousness and the people‚Äôs ever-changing eating habits.Fong, N.Y., \\"Ê∂ºËå∂„ÄåÁî≥ÈÅ∫„ÄçÂ§ï ÈôΩË°åÊ•≠ÂÜçÂçáÊ∫´\\", Sing Tao Daily, PP A22, Hong Kong, 24 March 2006. Special Feature =Containers to store herbal tea= Calabash Golden gourds Traditionally, Calabash, or Golden Gourds (), were regarded as symbol of herbal tea shops because calabash-shaped bottles are used to hold herbal tea. This symbol originated from a traditional Chinese story, in which the liquid in a calabash-shaped bottle cured sick people. In the 1940s, each herbal tea shop had two to three golden gourds with taps to store the herbal tea. Thermo flasks and metal tanks Later in the 1950s, the shops used thermo flasks and metal tanks to store and maintain the temperature of the herbal tea. To serve the customers, the staff would pour the herbal tea into porcelain bowls or cups. =Containers to make herbal tea= Prior to the 1970s, many shops would use a traditional clay pot to boil herbal tea. From the 1970s onwards, the shops began to use bigger copper tanks to boil herbal tea to increase the volume of herbal tea produced. =Setting= At the entrance of traditional herbal tea shops, there would be a table with various bowls of herbal teas placed on it. The bowls are covered with a glass-cover to prevent the herbal tea from cooling and also prevent impurities in the air from reaching the herbal tea. This setting enables customers to stand outside of the shop to drink herbal tea conveniently.

Since the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Abu Dis has been part of \\"Area B\\", under joint Israeli and Palestinian control. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, Abu Dis had a population of 10,782 in 2007.Abu Dis A waste disposal site was constructed in Abu Dis in the 1980s, in accordance with the 1987 Solid waste Disposal Master Plan for Judea and Samaria, and it was planned to operate for 20 years. The site is located between Abu Dis and Ayzrya on the eastern side of the separation barrier. It lies between Israeli settlements: Ma‚Äôale AdummimMaa'le Adummim and Qedar. The site is in \\"Area C\\", an area under the Oslo Accords,Oslo Accords over which Israel has complete authority. While the Abu Dis landfill serves both Israel and Palestine, a majority of the waste originates in Israeli cities and settlements. Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, constitutes for 90% of the waste. A small percentage of the waste comes from Israeli settlements within Palestine, and Palestinian communities contribute 6% of the waste.B‚Äôtselem and Bikom, op. cit., p 32. Costs and Restriction Two factors are prohibiting Palestinian access to the site: the landfill levy, and restricted access. 1\\\\. The Landfill Levy A levy is a tax that is intended to internalize the environmental cost of disposing of waste. In the case of the Abu Dis disposal site, there is a levy that is imposed on both sides (Palestinian and Israeli governments) for using the site. However, the economy of Israel is vastly different from that of Palestine (West Bank). For instance, the GDP of the West Bank per capita, in 2008, was $1485.30 while the GDP of Israel per capita, in 2008, was $28,291.90. This illustrates how Palestinians pay relatively higher in waste disposal costs than Israelis. Although Palestinians can not be denied from dumping waste at the site, they can be prevented from entering the site without the capability of keeping up with levy payment. 2\\\\. Restricted Access Palestinians are legally allowed to dispose of their waste at the site; however, Palestinian access to the site is restricted in other ways. Local councils are facing financial strains paying levies, which means they often cannot enter the site legally. Also, Israeli security concerns at times of conflict cause greater restrictions, prohibiting Palestinians from reaching the site.48Ecopeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East, op. cit., p 4. The result of the many restrictions is that Palestinian residents are unable to use the waste disposal site within their local area, while Israeli residents are capable of disposing their waste at the site. The limited Palestinian access to the site leads Abu Dis residents to illegally dump their waste at the site by entering it from the back entrance, which has been causing much environmental damage. Most of the waste is electronic and household waste; these are considered health hazards for the Bedouin communities surrounding the site. Another risk that local residents are exposed to is the release of toxins in the air from the burning of the waste that is piled in communal areas for prolonged times.  Environmental Damage and Health Risks  The Abu Dis waste disposal site is located above a mountain aquifer. Dissolving limestone above the aquifer poses a risk of polluting the groundwater. The acidic elements in the water, especially leachate, are dangerously polluting a valuable source of water.Ecopeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East, op. cit., p 3. Abu Dis waste disposal site is considered to be an \\"unsanitary waste dumpsite\\" because of the leachate being leaked into the aquifer and affecting freshwater used by both the Israeli and Palestinian side.Ecopeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East, op. cit., Map 1 Leachate collecting tanks are visible at the site; however, there is no sufficient information on the efficiency of the tanks in preventing the toxin seepage in the groundwater, in addition the location of these leachate tanks are exposed and poorly maintained.Ecopeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East, op. cit., p 20. Burning of waste is internationally unacceptable because it emits gases that contain toxins such as ammonia and hydrogen sulphate.Ecopeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East, op. cit., p 14. The accumulation of waste in the site is creating an unbearable stench that is carried in the wind and affecting Bedouin communities living nearby. Also, there is a risk of Methane exploding since the site is poorly managed; there are many concerns that the severe environmental risks are endangering human lives in the region.67Member of the Israeli Higher Planning Council, cited in B‚Äôtselem and Bikom, op. cit., p 42 Legal Framework 1\\\\. International Law According to International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the expropriation of land within occupied territories can only occur when due to military necessities for the benefit of the local population. The 1907 Hague Regulations state that the property of the occupied state must not be seized or destroyed unless \\"imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\\".Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (1907). The Hague, 18 October 1907. Article 23 (g) and Article 46. Article 55 of the Hague Regulations states that the properties of the occupied territory must be \\"safeguarded\\" and the occupying power can act only as \\"administrator\\".B‚Äôtselem and Bikom, op. cit., p 33. Article 147 of the Geneva Convention also affirms that \\" extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly\\" is to be considered a breach of the convention.Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949). Geneva, 12 August, Article 147. These provisions require the occupying power to preserve the natural environment of the occupied territories and to protect it from degradation. They are affirmed by both the Rio Declaration which notes that the States are obliged to ensure that no damage is caused to environment of other States that fall under their jurisdiction or controlThe Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992). Principle 2. and The Basel Convention requires that waste that is exported to another State is ‚Äúmanaged in an environmentally sound manner‚ÄùBasel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, op. cit. Article 4. 8). and that the quantity of waste exported is ‚Äúreduced to the minimum consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of such wastes‚Äù.The Convention emphasises the need to ‚Äúprotect human health and the environment against effects which may result from such movement [of waste].‚ÄùBasel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, op. cit. Article 2.d). 2\\\\. Oslo Accords The Oslo I (1993) and Oslo II (1995) Accords between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) laid out provisions for the two Parties cooperation and communication on environmental projects. According of Article 12 of the agreement, a committee on both sides should be established to ensure \\"environmental cooperation and understanding\\".Annex III Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs - Israeli- Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (1995). 28 September. Article 12. A) 22. This Joint Israeli-Palestinian committee would work together in implementing regulations and requiring an environmental impact assessment for major development programs that deals with solid waste disposal.Annex III Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs - Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,op. cit. Article 12. A) 7 In addition, Article 12 demands for the \\"protection of the environment and the prevention of environmental risks, hazards and nuisances including all kinds of soil, water and air pollution‚Äù and recognizes the ‚Äúunsatisfactory situation of the environment in the West Bank‚Äù and the ‚Äúmutual interest in improving this situation‚Äù for which Israel‚Äôs active assistance to the Palestinian side is required.Annex III Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs - Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, op. cit. Article 12. 3\\\\. Israeli Law According to Eyal Zamie, former deputy and legal advisor for Judea and Samaria, ‚ÄúExpropriation of land for public purposes [in the West Bank] is not prohibited. Three pre-conditions must be met: first, the acquisition is made in accordance with the local law; second, the landlord is fully compensated; and third, the acquisition is for a public purpose.‚ÄùEyal Zamie cited in B‚Äôtselem and Bikom, op. cit., p 16. However, Meir Shamgar, the former Israeli Supreme Court President, states, \\"With respect to expropriation in Judea and Samaria, it should be mentioned that international law generally denies the military government the authority to expropriate land in occupied territories; however, there is evidence supporting the position that it is permissible to expropriate land for the needs of the local population upon payment of compensation.‚ÄùMeir Shamgar cited in B‚Äôtselem and Bikom, op. cit., p 17. The Israeli Supreme Court allows the local population to dump their waste at the site since it is 'benefiting' them and this legitimizes the expropriation of land for 'public purpose' regardless of the environmental damage that will be caused to surrounding communities in the area. Also, the Israel State Attorney states that if Palestinian communities were no longer permitted to dispose of waste at the site, it would negate ‚Äúthe very legal justification for the existence of the site,‚Äù regardless of their capability of paying levies. He also states, \\"It is unreasonable to build and operate a waste disposal site in the heart of a certain population, without that population gaining benefit from the site, while it only bears the environmental costs.\\"Ma‚Äôale Adummim Municipality v.

Under the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system of inheritance prevalent in the kingdom of Travancore, it was her children who were heirs to the throne. She therefore held a very special place in the Travancore court, superior to the Maharaja's wives, and was termed the Rani of Attingal in her own right. In 2013, her only surviving son duly succeeded his uncles as titular Maharaja of Travancore and is known as Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma. Early years Born as the only daughter of Queen Mother Sethu Parvathi Bayi and Sri Ravi Varma Koyi Thampuran of Kilimanoor, she married Lt. Col. G. V. Raja. According to Oneindia online daily she was a witness to major events in pre-independent and independent India, was an accomplished dancer, singer and a linguist as well. In accordance to the tradition, she was also the Chief of Attingal Fiefdom, known as Mootha Thampuran. Karthika Thirunal with her younger brother, future Maharaja Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. Born as the only daughter of Sanskrit Scholar and aristocrat Sri Pooram Nal Ravi Varma Kochu Kovil Tampuran of Kilimanoor Kovilakam and Amma Maharani Moolam Thirunal Sethu Parvathi Bayi Of Travancore, on 17 September 1916, in the matrilineal Royal House of Travancore. She was educated by selected tutors and scholars. She mastered languages like Malayalam, Sanskrit, English, French etc. From her childhood itself, Karthika Thirunal was deeply interested in dance and music. Recognizing her interests, her elder brother, Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal, appointed Harikeshanelloor Muthaiyya Bhagavathar as her music teacher. In 1933, at the age of 16, Karthika Thirunal became the first from her family to undertake a sea voyage with her mother, against the then prevalent superstitious belief related to crossing the sea. She also participated in the All India Women's Conference of 1935, held in Trivandrum. Royal wedding As soon as Karthika Thirunal turned 16, it was decided to get her married. Usually, the Koyi Thampurans were chosen as bridegrooms for Travancore Princesses and Queens. According to Uthradom Thirunal, Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal and Sethu Parvathi Bayi ignored the superiority of Koyi Thampurans and got her married to a young aristocrat named P.R. Godavarma Raja of Poonjar Palace. The Maharajah felt that it was fine to make a different choice so as to find a suitable spouse for his sister and for the first time chose a bridegroom from the Poonjar Royal House. Lt. Col. P. R. Godavarma Raja ‚Äì Prince Consort of Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi during his military days When P.R. Ramavarma Raja, (husband of Karthika Thirunal's maternal aunt), visited Kowdiar Palace, he put forward the name of his younger brother Godavarma Raja (Col.G. V. Raja) as a prospective bridegroom for Karthika Thirunal. Godavarma Raja who later attained immortal fame as the King of Kerala Sports and Tourism, at the time of the proposal was studying in Madras for attaining a Degree in Medicine. The couple met each other in 1933. Godavarma accepted the wedding proposal for Karthika Thirunal's hand and discontinued his education there. Karthika Thirunal's family too approved, and the wedding was thus announced. It was the first time a Travancore Princess married some one other than a Koyi Thampuran. Poonjar Royal Family is believed to be the descendants of Pandya Dynasty. The preparations for the Pallikettu (wedding of a Travancore Princess)began in 1933 itself. Huge wedding venue was created at Sundara Vilasom Palace. Many prominent Indian Royals were invited for the wedding and the wedding was a lavish affair. The wedding of 17-year- old Karthika Thirunal and 26-year-old Godavarma Raja took place on 24 January 1934. The royal couple stayed at Kovalam for their honeymoon and it was during this time, Godavarma Raja, smitten by the beauty of the place, decided to develop and promote Kovalam as a tourist destination. After their wedding, G. V. Raja joined the Travancore State Force (Army) and served as a Lt. Colonel and as one of the commanding officers of the Nair Brigade (Travancore King's Bodyguards).https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Kovalam Kovalam Wikivoyage In 1934, the next Queen, H.H Karthika Thirunal choose this palace for her honeymoon with her newly wed husband, G.V.

The Maharaja of Travancore soon started hosting regular state banquets and accommodation of his European guests in Kovalam Haylcon Palace. This made the beach popular among European families living in nearby Madras and Bombay Presidencies as well as elite Travancore families to spend their holidays.

It focuses on a post-apocalyptic society that depends on cloning is overrun by a generation of faulty, homicidal clones.  Plot  Billions of people are killed in World War III, and most of the surviving males are rendered sterile. As a result, humanity resorts to cloning as its primary form of reproduction. All goes well until the first generation of clones turn nineteen and degenerate into bestial killers. The military attempts to contain the threat, but they are unsuccessful. Three groups of survivors who have fled into rural Florida are besieged by the killer clones. Ultimately, Jesse is the last to survive, and the film ends as he is surrounded.

Director Koszulinski was inspired by the French documentaries Blood of the Beasts and Night and Fog, and he used footage from Hiroshima mon amour. Other influences include Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Nosferatu, Night of the Living Dead, and I Am Legend. Koszulinski cast himself as the lead when he could not find anyone else willing to commit.

Reception  Eric Campos of Film Threat rated it 3/5 stars and called it a memorable and smart film that is reminiscent of 28 Days Later but with a fraction of the budget. Kyle Mitchell of The Gainesville Sun wrote, \\"The classic moral and functional questions of cloning dance quietly beside horror and gore for a truly mind-twisting mix.\\" HorrorNews.Net wrote that the film is too confusing and experimental to enjoy. In The Encyclopedia of Zombie Films, Volume 2, academic Peter Dendle wrote that the film \\"pretends to be a meditation on technology-gone-awry in a dystopic future but winds up being more of a meditation on pretentiousness.\\" = Awards = Koszulinski won Best Horror Director at the Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival and Best Emerging Talent at the Dahlonega International Film Festival.

As of 1990 this single area holds the largest population of Armenians in the world outside of Armenia.Bozorgmehr, Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, \\"Middle Easterners: A New Kind of Immigrant,\\" p. 352. Anny P. Bakalian, author of Armenian-Americans: From Being to Feeling Armenian, wrote that \\"Los Angeles has become a sort of Mecca for traditional Armenianness.\\"Bakalian, p. 429. Since 1965 and as of 1993, the majority of immigration of ethnic Armenians from Iran or the former Soviet Union have gone to the Los Angeles area. History The first Armenian families began to settle in the Los Angeles area starting in the late 19th century. Aram Yeretzian, a social worker and Protestant Christian minister who wrote a 1923 University of Southern California thesis on the Armenians of Los Angeles, stated that the first Armenian in Los Angeles arrived in around 1900. According to Yeretzian, the first Armenian was a student who left the East Coast due to health concerns. Yeretzian stated that the second Armenian was a vendor of Oriental rugs.Bakalian, p. 15. However, another states that In 1889 brothers John and Moses Pashgian opened their oriental rug business in Pasadena- which would make them the first. The first significant wave of Armenian immigration occurred from western Armenia, due to the Armenian Genocide during the violent disruption and break-up of the Ottoman Empire.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, p. 247. Most of the early Armenian settlers to Los Angeles were from Western Armenia- a territory located in modern-day eastern Turkey.Der- Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 250. Circa 1923 there were an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 Armenians in the city. By the mid-1920s more Armenians were settling in the Pasadena area. In 1924 the Varoujan Club was founded by 20 young Armenians to organize Armenian cultural and social events. During this period, the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) and the Compatriotic Reconstruction Union of Hadjin were founded. By 1933 there were 120 Armenian families in Pasadena. Nearly all of these immigrants were from the Ottoman Empire; very few were from the Russian Empire. The Pasadena Armenians settled in the area of Allen Avenue and Washington Boulevard, near the Church of the Nazarene, which was used by the Protestant Armenians. Another wave of immigration to Los Angeles occurred in the 1940s. Most Armenians then settled in Little Armenia in Hollywood.Texeira, Erin P. \\"Ethnic Friction Disturbs Peace of Glendale.\\" Los Angeles Times. June 25, 2000. p. 1. Retrieved on March 24, 2014. \\"Armenians fleeing violence and oppression at home began arriving in Los Angeles around the 1940s. Most settled in Hollywood--once called \\"Little Armenia\\"--and aspired to homes in Glendale, among other cities.\\" Due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which eased restrictions against newer immigrant groups, another wave of Armenian immigration to Los Angeles began. The Lebanese Civil War beginning in 1975 resulted in Lebanese Armenians immigrating here. Other political conflicts around the same time were catalysts for Iranian Armenians and Egyptian Armenians to settle in Los Angeles as well. Armenians from Fresno and the East Coast also moved to Los Angeles because of the large community there. Approximately 9,500 Armenians came to the United States in 1979 and 1980, and most settled in Hollywood. In August 1987, as part of glasnost, the Soviet Union began approving for exit visas for Armenians wishing to emigrate to the United States to reunite with relatives. As a result, from October 1987 through March 1988, 2,000 Armenians arrived in Los Angeles County. That March, county officials were expecting an additional 8,000 Armenians to arrive. The county officials stated that the expected immigration of 10,000 Armenians from the Soviet Union was the single largest arrival of an ethnic group after the late 1970s Vietnamese immigration.Arax, Mark and Esther Schrader. \\"County Braces for Sudden Influx of Soviet Armenians.\\" Los Angeles Times.

Some Los Angeles-area Armenian leaders believed that increased settlement in the United States would dilute the Armenian presence in the Soviet Union and area around Armenia, and therefore felt ambivalence. This wave of immigration eventually established Little Armenia in Hollywood. In 1988 up to 3,000 Iranian Armenians were scheduled to arrive in the Los Angeles area. From 1987 to 1989, 90% of Armenians leaving the Soviet Union settled in Los Angeles.Schrader, Esther. \\"Undertow: LA copes with the flood of Soviet emigres.\\" The New Republic. December 4, 1989.

In 2010 Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers signed a two-year endorsement with Turkish Airlines. Because the company is owned by the Turkish government, which Armenians hold responsible for the unacknowledged 1915 genocide, Armenians in the Los Angeles area and US protested, asking him to give up the contract.\\"Kobe Bryant‚Äôs deal with Turkish Airlines outrages Armenian Americans.\\" Los Angeles Times.

Demographics The Armenian population is subdivided according to their countries of birth, where groups had developed distinctly different cultures. In addition to those born in Armenia, these include those born in the United States, Iranian Armenians, Lebanese Armenians, and Turkish Armenians,Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 246. as well as those from elsewhere in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 248. =1920s= Aram Yeretzian's 1923 University of Southern California study found that there were around 2,500 to 3,000 Armenians in the city of Los Angeles. 12 Armenian men had married women from several backgrounds including American and Spanish, and three Armenian women had married American men. At the time the majority of Armenians were Turkish Armenians while some came from what was Russia at the time. The main push factor for Armenians was the Armenian Genocide‚Äîhowever, most Armenians ended up dispersed in countries such as Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. =1970s= With turbulent situations in Lebanon, Egypt and Iran during the 1970s, many Armenians came to the U.S. via family reunification channels.Light, Ivan Hubert., and Parminder Bhachu. Immigration and Entrepreneurship: Culture, Capital, and Ethnic Networks. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction, 1993. =1980s= By the 1980 U.S. Census, there were 52,400 Armenians in Los Angeles. Citing a 1988 work by Lieberson and Waters, Bakalian wrote, \\"...scholars find that these statistics from the 1980 census underestimate the actual number of Armenians in Los Angeles, and elsewhere in the U.S. for that matter\\". Of these Armenians, foreign-born made up more than twice the number of native-born: 14,700 were born in the United States and 37,700 were born outside of the United States. Of those born in the U.S., 10,200 were born in California and 4,500 were born elsewhere. Of those born outside of the U.S., 7,700 came from Iran, 7,500 from the former Soviet Union, 6,000 from Lebanon, 5,100 from Turkey, 6,200 from elsewhere in the Middle East, and 5,200 from other countries. Immigration had been heavy in the 1970s. As of 1980 about 66% of Armenian immigrants overall, 70% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Iran, and Lebanon, and 60% of Armenians from Turkey, had arrived between 1975 and 1980. As of 1980 the median age of U.S.-born Armenians in Los Angeles was 25. The median age for Turkish Armenians was 64; they had resided in the U.S. the longest. The median ages for other Armenians born outside of the U.S. ranged from 26 to 36. One major push factor for Armenians in the 1980s was the 1988 Armenian earthquake which left many buildings destroyed in Yerevan. Soviet policy at the time allowed for many of the refugees to reunite with family abroad.Brand, David. \\"Soviet Union Vision of Horror.\\" TIME Magazine 26 Dec. 1988: n. pag. Web. =1990s= As of the 1990 U.S. Census, there were 115,000 Armenians in the Los Angeles region, making up 37% of the total number of Armenians in the country. The dissolution of the Soviet Union allowed many Armenians to move abroad. Geography Glendale The Burbank/Glendale, East Hollywood, Montebello, and Pasadena areas are the primary settlement points of Armenians, according to the 1980 U.S. Census; as of that census, Armenians in the areas together made up 90% of Armenians in Los Angeles County. As of 1991 the established Armenian communities in the area included Encino and Hollywood in Los Angeles as well as the cities of Montebello and Pasadena. The Burbank/Glendale settlement is newer.Clifford, Frank and Anne C. Roark. \\"Racial Lines in County Blur but Could Return: Population: Times study of census finds communities far more mixed.

In 1980, Armenians in East Hollywood made up 56% of Armenians in Los Angeles County. In 1988, Mark Arax and Esther Schrader wrote that Hollywood \\"has become something of a port of entry for the Soviet refugees.\\" In 1989 Vered Amit Talai wrote that \\"the Soviet Armenian emigrants form a very visible community in Hollywood\\".Talai, Vered Amit. \\"Armenians in London: The Management of Social Boundaries\\" (Issue 4 of Anthropological Studies of Britain/Armenian Research Center collection/Volume 4 of Studies on East Asia).

In 1989 Talai wrote that Armenians in Hollywood had a negative effect on the Armenian reputation in California because they were \\"visible\\" and \\"indigent\\" but that the indigent status is \\"unusual\\" relative to the overall Armenian diaspora. On October 6, 2000, the community in East Hollywood was named Little Armenia by the Los Angeles City Council. The city council noted that \\"the area contains a high concentration of Armenian businesses and residents and social and cultural institutions including schools, churches, social and athletic organizations.\\" By 1988 many Armenians were moving from Hollywood to suburban Glendale, Burbank, and other areas. By that time, some immigrants settled directly in Glendale and Burbank. Historically many of the Glendale Armenians were from Iran. In the 1980 U.S. Census, Armenians in Glendale comprised 25% of Armenians in Los Angeles County. In the Glendale Unified School District, by 1988 Armenians along with students from the Middle East had become the largest ethnic group in the public schools, having a larger number than the Latinos. Alice Petrossian, the GUSD director of intercultural education, stated that Burbank lies within the middle of other Armenian communities, so it attracted more Armenians. Levon Marashlian, an Armenian history teacher at Glendale Community College, stated that Glendale's Armenian population became larger than Hollywood's by the early 1990s. As the 2000 U.S. Census, 30% of the residents of Glendale were Armenian.Pang, Kevin. \\"Glendale Unified May Add Armenian Holiday.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 8, 2004. Retrieved on July 2, 2014.

In 1980, Armenians in Pasadena were 9% of the county's total number of Armenians. By 1989, the makeup of the Armenian community in Pasadena had changed: of Armenians in Pasadena, 33% were born in Lebanon, 17% were U.S.-born, 16% were born in Armenia, 12% were born in Syria, and the remainder were born in other places. The city government had gathered the data through a special census.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 251.

The 1980 self-employment rate of Armenians in total was 18%. Of the Turkish Armenians the rate was 32%. The other Armenian groups had self-employment rates close to 18%. Armenia-born Armenians had an 11% self-employment rate. Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr wrote that the Armenia-born Armenians were less likely to start their own businesses compared to other groups because \\"the tradition of entrepreneurship may not have been as strong in the Soviet socialist economy as it remained in Middle Eastern market economies.\\" In addition, this group had arrived with no or very little capital and the members were not permitted to take money out of the former Soviet Union. The 1980 percentage of general employment of the general Los Angeles population was 9%. Compared to other Iranian groups, Iranian Armenians had a higher likelihood of economic ties with one another. Most customers and employees of Iranian Armenians who had self-employment were not Armenian and not Iranian, while most business partners of self-employed Iranian Armenians were fellow Iranian Armenians. Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr concluded that the Iranian Armenian ethnicity had a \\"special strength\\".Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 255. According to Yeretzian's 1923 study, 39.5% of Los Angeles Armenians were skilled laborers, 23.5% were agricultural laborers, 2.3% were professionals, and the remainder worked in other occupations as laborers.Bakalian, p. 16.

He argued that many of the poor are not familiar with American customs and are uneducated, this therefore \\"risks increasing prejudice and discrimination against group members.\\" Bakalian stated his belief that \\"Los Angeles is not representative of Armenian-Americans or the Armenian-American community.\\" As of 1980, 80% of Iranian Armenians have fellow Armenian Iranians at their social gatherings and as spouses and close friends. Iranian Armenian parents have proportionately higher numbers of Armenian friends compared to their children. Zankou Chicken has locations throughout the Los Angeles area.

The majority of Armenian churches established in Los Angeles by 1993 had been established after World War II. Former Governor of California George Deukmejian was an Armenian Episcopalian. Education Claudia Der- Martirosian, Georges Sabagh, and Mehdi Bozorgmehr, authors of \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" wrote that in 1980 \\"the general level of education among all Armenians in Los Angeles was fairly high.\\" Different subgroups of Armenian immigrants had differing levels of education. As of 1980, almost no U.S.-born Armenian men, and fewer of one out of ten Armenian-born Armenians and Iranian Armenians had low levels of education; these groups had the highest modal education category, with men achieving university degrees and women not having university degrees. Almost half of Turkish Armenian men, who were older compared to other Armenians, had some elementary school education. The modal education category of Turkish Armenians was the lowest, with both men and women having elementary education. Almost one quarter of Lebanese Armenian men and Armenian men from elsewhere in the Middle East had a limited elementary school education. Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr wrote that \\"Although women, generally, had a lower educational achievement than did men, internal differences among subgroups were comparable to those of the Armenian men.\\" Because of the presence of uneducated Armenians, overall there were fewer Los Angeles Armenians with a postgraduate university education compared to those who had only an elementary level education. =Primary and secondary education= Public schools As of 1990, the largest immigrant group speaking an ethnic home language in the Glendale Unified School District was Armenians.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 250-251.

Under debate is the legality of derivative works popular on the internet, including doujin drawings, kuso, parodies, and the modification and adaptation of the lyrics in Hong Kong. Because of the upsurge of derivative work, the Hong Kong Government has amended related legislations in order to regulate the Internet, as well as legislation extending coverage to the existing network of Internet users. The name \\"Internet Article 23\\" comes from the controversial Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 on national security that detractors say would curb personal freedoms. Many people believe that related regulations will let the derivative work bear criminal responsibility easily, including the modified or adapted song or pictures. As a result, it strived to public opposition. Due to the opposition, the Government shelved the amendment in May 2012. By July 2013 the Government launched a consultation once again in order to let people discuss on how this type of \\"parody works\\" can be exempted from criminal responsibility. Actually, the Internet Article 23 includes the following legislations: * The Copyright Ordinance - Focus on digital online copyright infringement issues * Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance - Focus on online human flesh search engine problems * The Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance - Focus on the problems of online sharing of pornographic movies and pictures * Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance - Focus on problems of sharing informations to children under 16 years old such as pornographic animations Discussion On the controversial topic of whether allowing derivative work in Hong Kong, intense debate occurs in the city. People who are against re-creation deem it necessary to introduce legislation to regulate or even prohibit derivative work, with an aim to protect the reputation and interest of the original author. They criticized those involved in derivative work for not respecting copyright.\\\\- Copyright Crackdown Those against the law amendment reasoned that derivative works encompass too broad a spectrum for the legal restrictions to be justified, and that the amended law could stifle mass creativity, violating the freedom of creation. Criticisms about the emphasis on self-interest of productions were also fired, stating that the new law shows a lack of consideration for the public's right to enjoy derivatives and inhibits the expression of opinions about the original work.\\\\- Dictionary of Politically Incorrect Hong Kong Cantonese It has also been brought out that the original author has the right to distribute their work, which includes the prohibition of use, adaptation, selling and all kinds of derivation. As it depends on the acknowledgement of the author, it is doubtful as to whether derivative works violate copyright. Re-consultation on Internet Article 23 On July 11, 2013, based on the issue users concern most about the amendment of the Copyright Ordinance, kuso work, the Government published the consultation document and offers three options, launched a three-month public consultation. The first option has the same concessions proposed by the Government last year. Parody commonly disseminated on the Internet nowadays would likely fall outside the criminal net given that they would not normally displace the market of the copyright work and distribution of the same would unlikely cause ‚Äúmore than trivial economic prejudice‚Äù to the copyright owner. The second option specifies that the prejudicial distribution offense shall not apply to parodies, as long as the distribution in question meets the qualifying condition. The third option is recommended that, in accordance with Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom's experience and method, the distribution of parody would not infringe copyright and hence would not attract any criminal liability, as long as the act is considered as fair dealing.\\\\- Key Points of the Consultation Paper on Parody On the same day, the Keyboard Frontline and the Concern Group of Rights of Derivative Works issued a joint declaration stated that they have received an email from the Intellectual Property Department in the afternoon on July 10, inviting related organizations concerned with the amendment of Copyright Ordinance to Central Government Offices at 11:30 am on July 11 to discuss parody issue of Copyright (Amendment) Bill. They believe that the Government invited them in less than 24 hours, questioned its sincerity, and suspected that the Government didn't welcome the organization opposing Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2011 and created the illusion of \\"consulted with the opposition\\". They said \\"very dissatisfied\\" and boycotted the meeting, reaffirmed that they urge the Government to fully exempt the legal responsibility of derivative work. Related issues The aim of distributing Internet Article 23 to boycott subordinate work On 3 June 2011, the Hong Kong government distributed the draft of Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2011 form in the Gazette. In the draft, it incorporated the netizens \\"parody\\" and other innovative works in the optional encroachment go. It at that point draw a ton of contention, the netizens felt that it would deny their right to speak freely and imaginative which ought to be secured by the Basic Law. There were lots of controversy among the society, the majority of the netizens tended to beg differ with the draft while some of the copyright holder tended to support. CHAN Kam-lam, one of the legislative councilors in Hong Kong said that he agreed with the draft, tons of kuso targeting Chan then being created and published online. Netizens launched demonstrations to show their stands concerning the derivative work On 4 December 2011, some social movement organizations like Keyboard Frontline and Netizens Power launched a demonstration which aimed to show their discontent about the draft of Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2011 version which defined derivative work as Criminal charge without any consultation in the society. Not long, the Government said that the second round debate of the draft will be restarted in the Legislative Council. Once again, the netizens launched another demonstration to show disagree and for this time, they even demonstrated to Central Government Offices.

A graduate student in literature and history, she appeared in a short video, entitled I Am a Ukrainian, which went viral after being posted in February 2014. In the spring of 2014 she gave talks about the cause of Ukrainian freedom in the United States and Canada and was interviewed by news media from dozens of countries. In June 2015, a 24-year- oldhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qREAA0FBBdc Marushevska joined the Odessa regional government team led by Mikheil Saakashvili, a former President of Georgia who was appointed a Governor of the region. Marushevska was then appointed chief of Odessa Customs in October 2015 and resigned from that post in November 2016 because she felt the then Groysman government made custom reforms no longer possible.Saakashvili's ally also steps down, Ukraine Today (14 November 2016) Early life and education Yulia Marushevska was born on 2 October 1989 in the village of Shcherbani in Voznesensk Raion, Mykolaiv Oblast, southern Ukraine. She was raised in the village of Sadove in Tatarbunary Raion, Odessa Oblast. \\"I grew up as an ordinary, Western child,\\" she told the Stanford Daily in an April 2014 interview. She is a Ph.D. candidate in literature and history at Taras Shevchenko University in Kyiv. She stated in a post-video interview, \\"I study Ukrainian literature but I cannot think about my Ph.D. paper. It's very important now to change the system because my degree would be useless in a corrupt society. If you want to understand something about Ukrainian protest spirit, try to find Taras Shevchenko in English.\\" Marushevska was not politically active prior to the protests, \\"but when the government stopped an agreement with the EU I was very frustrated.\\" She decided to take part in the Euromaidan protests, taking to the streets \\"from the very beginning of the protests.\\" She worked as a volunteer on a phone hotline and worked as a guard in a hospital from which injured protesters had been kidnapped by police and put in prison. Her mother, also a fervent supporter of the EuroMaidan Revolution, \\"volunteered day and night to help feed demonstrators and slept on the barricades.\\" Marushevska was a student teacher and took her students to the Maidan during the protests \\"to study Ukraine there, not in the classroom.\\" I Am a Ukrainian =Making the video= The video was shot by British cinematographer Graham Mitchell and posted by American filmmaker Ben Moses, producer of the movie Good Morning Vietnam. Marushevska met Moses when she was working for him as a translator for his documentary on Andriy Shevchenko. At the time she made the video, she was 24 years old. It was Marushevska's idea to film a stand-up video on Hrushevskoho Street, where two men had been killed in the protests. \\"I wanted to tell the world what was really going on in Ukraine,\\" she later explained. \\"One day I woke up and I read in the news about two men who were killed during the protests. It affected me very much because I never seen a situation where innocent people were being killed just because they showed that they don‚Äôt want such a government.\\" The Kyiv Post stated that she was motivated partly by guilt \\"because she felt that she wasn't doing enough to help the EuroMaidan Revolution and partly out of frustration with foreigners' ignorance about why demonstrators were camping out on Kyiv's freezing streets to change their government.\\" She told the Kyiv Post, \\"People know nothing about Ukraine. Ukraine is terra incognita for the world.\\" She and Mitchell made their way to the Maidan, where the two men had been killed, and made the video. \\"It was very cold, minus 20, and I was freezing to death,\\" she later recalled. \\"I did two tries, two takes, but I was frozen to death and could not talk anymore. My accent is horrible. I could not find the right words and right intonation. I tried. I thought I would try later, maybe I will do it better. But then all these events happened and the situation got worse. It was apathy and depression, and I had no energy to do it again.\\" In the video, Marushevska is standing at the Maidan at midnight two days after the first killings. She states: \\"I want you to know why thousands of people all over my country are on the streets. There is only one reason: We want to be free from a dictatorship. We want to be free from the politicians who work only for themselves, who are ready to shoot, to beat, to injure people just for saving their money, just for saving their houses, just for saving their power. I want these people who are here to have dignity, who are brave, I want them to live a normal life. We are civilized people, but our government are barbarians ‚Ä¶ We want to be free. I know that maybe tomorrow we will have no phone, no Internet connection and we will be alone here. And maybe police will murder us one after another, when it will be dark here.\\" She later said: \\"It was very important for me to show the protesters on the street are not terrorists, extremists, bandits or Nazis as it was shown in some media. We are normal people from the whole of Ukraine‚Ä¶who speak different languages, and are fighting for our right to have a normal standard of living and a real democracy, not the illusion of democracy that we had before.\\" She sent the video to Moses, who edited it and sent it back. She then showed it to friends, who assured her that \\"it's powerful and it can work.\\" =Marushevska's post-video comments= In an interview with The Daily Beast, published on February 21, 2014, after the death of about 100 people in protests in Kyiv, Marushevska stated: \\"When you see this violence on the street, you understand these people [the authorities], they are like not humans, they are from another reality. I don't know how to influence them. I understand the only language they know is the language of power, the language of money.\\" She also said that the conflict in Ukraine is about \\"the opportunity‚Ä¶to have a chance to develop. If we lose, we will lose not only economic possibilities. We will lose hope.\\" She told Voice of America that \\"we are not just fighting for another president, we are fighting for a normal human life, on a normal social level, with normal values.\\" \\"People are not planning to leave Independence Square because they feel responsible now,\\" she said in March 2014. \\"I am optimistic about the future. I believe we will build a normal, prosperous, democratic society but I am realistic about how much work we have ahead. Maybe we will have to become even stronger because this is only the first step. There are hundreds of steps ahead.\\" She has expressed remorse that in a country as rich as Ukraine \\"so many live a poor life\\", with 30-40% of Ukrainians living below the poverty line. \\"If there isn‚Äôt enough money to cure children from cancer but always enough money to buy new furniture from the best Italian designers, it's really sad. The problem is this disrespect ‚Äì people lived on this small amount of money without having a dignified life.\\" Marushevska told the Kyiv Post that while making the video, she wondered whether she was exaggerating when she called Yanukovych a dictator. \\"I was doubting it,\\" she admitted. But after she was taken on a tour of Yanukovych's palace, \\"I understood that he was a real dictator who did whatever he wanted‚Ä¶golden forks and so forth. A normal person doesn't do that when there are children dying from cancer and he's buying this stupid, useful [sic], ugly stuff for nothing. It's useless.\\" Marushevska stated that she admires the U.S. due to the rule of freedom, but is sceptical of European democracy, which is rife with red tape. Her hope for Ukraine is that it will develop \\"an American democracy without a European bureaucracy.\\" \\"I respect Russian people,\\" she told Charlie Rose in an April 10 interview, \\"but I will never respect the humiliation of my country.\\" She has said that she did not take any personal pleasure from her fame because \\"it is based on the tragedy of my country and dozens of people‚Ä¶ I'm associated with tragedy... But I know how much more people gave to Maidan, like my mom spending days and nights on the barricades, like a lot of people who risked their lives.\\" In another interview she said, \\"I dream to create something else, not this. We'll create great things, positive things about normal life, about beauty, about art, about love, about the best parts of my country.\\" The video, she noted, \\"was translated into Ukrainian and showed on our news channel. I am not a celebrity, I would rather have no attention. I am not a symbol of happiness, I am a symbol of a bad time in Ukraine and there is nothing joyful about that.\\" She has expressed the hope that other countries will have more open visa policies with Ukraine and establish more student exchange programs, and that Ukraine will attract more international business and commerce. =Russian reaction= The Russian TV network RT claimed that Marushevska's video was a product of the U.S. State Department.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63arp4ZuJyo Ben Moses said that the Russians were \\"terrified\\" by the video's impact and had begun to attack her character. Foreign appearances On March 26, 2014, Marushevska spoke in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. She expressed gratitude for the support of the international community for the struggle of the Ukrainian people and underscored that her people‚Äôs fight is not with the Russian people but with Putin's government. She said, \\"I hope that one day the Russian people will win its fight against corruption and for freedom.\\" On the same day she took part in a panel discussion at the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy, where she talked about the Ukrainian news media's reaction to her video, which some considered propaganda. Marushevska spoke at the ICC Auditorium at Georgetown University on April 2, 2014. Moses appeared with her, and talked about the role of social media in the Ukrainian protests. Georgetown's student newspaper, the Hoya reported that \\"Attendees came away impressed by Marushevska's poise in delivering her message, and her ability to convey the emotions felt by everyday Ukrainians.\\"http://www.thehoya.com/euromaidan- activist-shares-experience/ On April 8, she spoke at Stanford University. She was interviewed on Charlie Rose on April 10. On April 13 she spoke at Christ the King Ukrainian Catholic Church in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On April 16, she participated in a panel discussion, Rights, Repression, and Revolution: A Tale of Two Countries ‚Äì Ukraine and Venezuela, at Harvard University. In Canada, she appeared on Sun News and spoke at a rally outside Toronto City Hall. She expressed the Ukrainian people's gratitude for international support and about the importance of this support in helping boost Ukrainian people's morale and overcome their fear. She expressed her respect for the Russian people and her hope that they, too, would win their fight for freedom, and said that the Ukrainians would be on their side.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OjY25hnJwY She spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum on October 21, 2014. State services career On June 9, 2015, Mikheil Saakashvili, the Head of the Odessa Oblast State Administration (Governor), announced the inclusion of Marushevska in his transitional team. According to Mikheil Saakashvili, Marushevska had previously spent a year of training at Harvard and Stanford universities.https://www.facebook.com/SaakashviliMikheil/posts/1002025789827802:0 On June 23, he announced his appointment of Marushevska as head of a newly created Investment agency of the Odessa regional government.http://www.048.ua/news/866474 On 16 October 2015, President Petro Poroshenko announced that Marushevska would serve as the head of Odessa customs. Commenting in May 2016, Saakashvili said, \\"Nobody took her seriously when she was appointed. ... But she has this grit to really change things.\\" Marushevska clashed with the head of the State Fiscal Service, Roman Nasirov, who has been implicated in corruption. Marushevska resigned as custom head on 14 November 2016, saying \\"The government doesn't have the political will to conduct the reform of the Customs service. Kyiv doesn't have a vision of the reforms\\". Other sources stated that she resigned after her anti-corruption reform efforts were sabotaged not only by Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman alone, but by President Petro Poroshenko as well.Live Blog: Ukraine In Crisis , rferl.org, November 18, 2016 In December, Nasirov said that he was investigating Marushevska for corruption. She stated that his accusations were politically-motivated and that officials interested in preserving the status quo had blocked her work, including attempts to dismiss corrupt officials.

At the woman's request, British photographer Graham Mitchell filmed her speaking on the Maidan, and her friend, Ben Moses, edited the material into video he posted on her behalf on YouTube. By late March that year the video had been viewed over 8 million times. Background The woman in the video was initially not named in order to keep her safe, but was eventually identified as Yulia Marushevska, a Kyiv Ph.D. student of Ukrainian literature at Taras Shevchenko National University.Denys Krasnikov, Yulia Marushevska: Revolutionary leader embodies hope of Ukrainians for bright corruption-free future, Kyiv Post, December 1, 2016. Marushevska conceived, wrote, and produced the video after the death of five people, three of whom died of gunshot wounds, on January 22. Marushevska felt she needed to do more for the EuroMaidan, and was frustrated with what she perceived to be the foreigners‚Äô ignorance about why the protests were happening. She wanted to inform the viewers that the Ukrainians want to change their government due to concerns over alleged unchecked corruption within it. They ended up shooting a 2-minute, 4 second long video where she speaks in English. Popularity After only a few days on YouTube the video had about 3.5 million views. The video has received mostly positive reception, with the majority of the tens of thousands of comments supportive. By February 21 the video had approximately 70,000 \\"likes\\" and 4,000 \\"dislikes\\". A minority of voices argued that it is too one-sided. It has also been criticized for its professional production value, invoking a comparison to the controversial Kony 2012 viral video, which misled viewers into thinking it was a purely amateur production. BBC News has described it as having the greatest impact of any video from the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Moses has now completed a feature- length documentary, Witness to a Revolution, about Yulia's and Ukraine's progress in the year following her viral video. Aftermath In July 2015 Mikheil Saakashvili, Governor of Odessa, announced that Yulia Marushevska accepted a job as Deputy Head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. According to Mikheil Saakashvili Yulia Marushevska had previously spent a year of training at Harvard and Stanford universities.

For many years she was the popular prima buffa (or first woman) in comic opera at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket. In her later years, she was known by her married name, Joanna Stocqueler. Biography =Youth= Giovanna Sestini was baptised 7 April 1749 in the in the small town of Lastra a Signa, near Florence.Archivio della Curia Arcivescovile di Firenze. Libri dei Battezzati della Pieve di S. Martino a Gangalandi in Lastra a Signa (Firenze) : I - R.P.C 836 -1-battesimi dal 1727 al 1746: 194 She was the daughter of Pietro (son of Silvestro Sestini) and Maria Altomira, daughter of Dottore Eustachio Speramundi Fabbrini. She had a sister Anna (born 1745), also a singer, and a brother Vincenzo (born 1743) who became a renowned theatrical wardrobe master in London. Giovanna and Anna sang in opera buffa in various Italian cities between 1763 and about 1767. =Move to Lisbon= When recovering from the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese theatres actively recruited performers from Italy. These included Giovanna and Anna Sestini who sang in Italian opera at the new Teatro da Rua dos Condes in Lisbon from 1768 until 1774.de Brito, Manuel Carlos, Opera in Portugal in the Eighteenth Century (Cambridge, 1969) Giovanna was better paid as she took more demanding roles than her sister of whom nothing more is then known. =Marriage= Jos√© Christiano Stocqueler (1749‚Äì1812) was descended from a merchant and consul originally from Hamburg, Christian Stockler (ca 1688‚Äì1772), who had married well in Portugal. The family moved in Court circles and Jos√© Christiano had been made a Knight of the Order of Christ at the age of nineteen. His family disapproved when he formed a liaison with a beautiful Italian opera singer,Stocqueler, Joachim Hayward, The Memoirs of a Journalist. Enlarged, Revised (London, 1873) but he and Giovanna Sestini married and two sons were born before they moved to London. =Move to London= In 1774 there were difficulties in the Lisbon theatres and Giovanna Sestini entered a contract to be prima buffa at the King's Theatre in London for the coming season.Nalbach, Daniel, The King's Theatre 1704‚Äì1867: London's First Italian Opera House (London, 1972). With her husband and sons she took lodgings in Oxendon Street close to the Haymarket. Her London debut was as La Cecchina in Niccol√≤ Piccinni's La buona figliuola and she was immediately acclaimed even though in an advanced state of pregnancy. Her third son was born on New Year's Day 1775 and baptised Joseph Christian Stocqueler in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Portuguese Embassy Chapel in Mayfair. =Further career= Sestini sang comic roles in Italian at the King's Theatre during many seasons until the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1789. She was at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, in Italian opera in 1777‚Äì78, and singing in English in 1784‚Äì85. When she first sang on the English stage at Covent Garden in 1782 the part of Lorenza in John O'Keeffe's The Castle of Andalusia was especially adapted to suit her broken English. As usual she received glowing reviews in the press, but again had to withdraw after five performances for the birth of her eighth and last child. Sestini had further engagements at Covent Garden and also sang in the summer programmes at the Little Theatre or with Elizabeth Bannister at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. In all she sang over sixty operatic roles: her most frequent performance was as Violante in Giovanni Paisiello's La frascatana. Sestini augmented her income by singing at private concerts ‚Äì including in 1775 for the Royal family. She also performed at the Oxford Music Rooms, the Freemasons' Hall and the Pantheon in London, and in 1792 at St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh. This was her last professional engagement. =Family= Sestini's husband Jos√© Christiano Stocqueler became the London agent of the Royal Wine Company of Oporto. One of their sons, known as Master Sestini, performed at Charles Dibdin's Royal Circus in Blackfriars Road and also Young Sestini sang in support of the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in 1787. The line \\"I am a Merry Andrew, Andrew is my name\\" has led to the erroneous suggestion that the Stocquelers had a son called Andrew.Highfill., Philip H., et al., eds. A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers and other Stage Personnel in London 1600‚Äì1800 Vol 13 (Carbondale IL, 1991) None of the Stocqueler children had a stage career as an adult. A grandson Joachim Hayward Stocqueler was a journalist, writer, lecturer and rogue who also used the name Siddons. =Death= Joanna Stocqueler died on 14 July 1814, two years after her husband, at their last home in Broad Street Buildings, Bishopsgate, in the City of London. They were both buried in the graveyard of St Pancras Old Church. Neither newspaper reports of her death nor her epitaphCansick, Frederick Teague, A Collection of Curious and Interesting Epitaphs, Copied from the Monuments of Distinguished and Noted Characters in the Ancient Church and Burial Grounds of Saint Pancras, Middlesex (London, 1869) p. 93. made any mention of Giovanna Sestini's distinguished career as a singer.

The book, which was produced through Full Fathom Five, was released on April 1, 2014 through HarperCollins and was preceded by the novella No Place Like Oz. Synopsis Amy Gumm, a high school student living in Kansas, has a dismal life. She is bullied at school for her snarky demeanor, and is neglected by her substance-abusing mother. After her mother leaves to go to a party, Amy's trailer is caught in a tornado and transported to the Land of Oz, but is trapped in a canyon. She is rescued by a mysterious boy named Pete who tells her to go to the Emerald City. Amy, accompanied by her mother's pet rat, Star, and a punk Goth Munchkin named Indigo, learns Oz has been conquered by Dorothy Gale, now a power-hungry, self-proclaimed princess and dictator. Rescuing a crucified wingless flying monkey, Ollie, Amy encounters the Tin Woodman, Dorothy's grand inquisitor and protector, who arrests her and kills Indigo. Ollie flees and abandons them. Amy reunites with Pete, who claims to be a gardener in the royal palace and tells her she will be rescued. On the night of her \\"fate worse than death\\", Amy is rescued by Mombi, a member of a secret society called the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked, who wish to free Oz from Dorothy's control. The group includes Mombi, Grandma Gert, Glinda's twin sister Glamora, and several teenage warriors including a warlock named Nox who wishes to avenge his family and friends. The Order reveals they recruited Amy to train her in magic and then assassinate Dorothy. Amy agrees and is taught how to use magic by Gert, armed with an enchanted dagger (which Nox made her). The Order attempts to eliminate the Cowardly Lion, now a ravenous monster who absorbs the fear of others, but the attack fails, leading to Gert's death. The Order move on with their main plan, magically disguising Amy as a maid in the royal palace. They inform her an unnamed agent of theirs will be watching her. Amy, under the alias of Astrid, encounters the delusional Princess Ozma, and learns the Wizard himself has returned to Oz. Amy also encounters Ollie, who has sneaked into the palace to rescue his sister Maude from the Scarecrow, who has become a mad scientist and performs inhuman experiments on Ozians. Amy breaks into the Scarecrow's underground laboratory and rescues Maude, but has to saw off her wings to prevent Dorothy from controlling her. Ollie and Maude flee. The next day, the Tin Woodman searches for the culprit, and Jellia Jamb, Dorothy's handmaid, takes the blame, revealing herself to be Amy's backup. Jellia tries to assassinate Dorothy, but is maimed by the Lion. A large gala is held in the palace. Amy, working as a waitress still under the disguise of Astrid, discovers the Scarecrow has turned Jellia into a zombie servant. Amy reunites with Nox, who at this point is in disguise as well, and uses the Tin Woodman as a distraction to take Dorothy to her chamber, where she attempts the assassination; but she is thwarted by Toto and the Tin Woodman. As the Order storm the palace, Amy tackles Dorothy over a balcony, but the latter teleports herself safely away using her ruby slippers. Amy is rescued by Ollie and Maude, using makeshift wings, and taken to Pete and the Wizard, who tells her a way to defeat Dorothy is to slay her companions and bring him the brain, heart, and courage he bestowed upon them. The Tin Woodman appears; Amy slays the Woodman, taking his heart before flying away to safety with the monkeys, accompanied by Ozma, who reveals that she is Pete's true identity. Main characters * Amy Gumm: The story's protagonist. Amy lives a rough life, such as living with her alcoholic, pill-popping mother and being bullied in school. She's swept out of Kansas with her mother's pet rat, Star, and into Oz by a cyclone. Her sarcastic attitude gets her into trouble from time to time. Amy's surname, Gumm, is an homage to Judy Garland, who portrayed Dorothy in the 1939 movie Wizard of Oz. Garland's real name was Frances Ethel Gumm. * Madison Pendleton: A girl who has bullied Amy since elementary school and is now pregnant by her boyfriend, whom Amy allows to cheat off her homework. A fight between the two girls causes Amy to be suspended from school. * Pete: A mysterious young boy who saves Amy when she arrives in Oz and pops in at different parts of the story, actually the male alter ego of Ozma (a.k.a. Tip). * Indigo: A spirited and bad-tempered goth punk munchkin who meets Amy and leads her to the Emerald City. Indigo's tattoos tell the history of Oz before Dorothy's rule. * Ollie: A wingless talking monkey that Amy and Indigo save when he's strapped upside down to a pole for the crime of \\"Sass\\". He wants to save his little sister from the Scarecrow's lab. * The Revolutionary Order of the Wicked: A group of witches who have formed an alliance and recruit Amy to kill Dorothy. **Gert: The former Good Witch of the North, now a member of the Order of the Wicked. She is the nicest member of the group, encouraging Amy to improve when she initially fails during her training. She dies protecting Amy and Nox from the Lion. ** Nox: Amy's love interest; a mysterious warlock who is part of the Order. ** Glamora: Glinda's twin sister, who is the third member of the Order. Her so-called \\"Good\\" sister gave her a nasty scar many years ago that Glamora covers with magical makeup. She also taught Amy etiquette skills. ** Mombi: The fourth member of the Order, who rescues Amy from the Emerald City's dungeon and brings her to the other witches. * Dorothy Gale: The antagonist of the story. Dorothy is no longer the sweet, kind-hearted farm girl of The Wizard Of Oz. Now she is a highly sexualized, power-hungry tyrant who has ruined Oz, sapping the land of most of its magic. Her frequent mood swings and cruel punishments leave her subjects constantly on edge. Though she donned silver shoes during her first time in Oz, she now wears ruby slippers given to her by Glinda that she never takes off, which are the source of both her power and corruption. * The Scarecrow: No longer satisfied with the brains given to him by the Wizard, the Scarecrow performs barbaric experiments on winged monkeys and takes bits of their brains for himself. * The Tin Woodman: His tin body is now monstrous, with knives for fingers. Despite his evil actions, he has an unrequited love for Dorothy. She is aware of this, but is disgusted by him. * The Cowardly Lion: No longer a coward, the Lion is now a blood-hungry, super-buff beast who kills people by literally draining the fear out of them. * Glinda: The Good Witch of the South, she has aligned with Dorothy and forces young Munchkin children to mine for magic by use of a violent, seesaw-like machine. Her mouth is permanently shaped into a grotesque grin by a new invention called Perma-smile. * Princess Ozma: The former princess of Oz, whose place Dorothy usurped after her return to Oz. Subjects outside the Emerald City have not seen her in years, but those who live and work in the palace see an Ozma who is vacant and bubble-headed, a shell of her former self. * Jellia Jamb: Dorothy's top maid. Her sweet, bubbly persona masks a fear of her mistress though she does everything in her power to please her. * Star: Amy's mother's pet rat. Accompanies Amy in Oz after both of them are taken by the twister. Prequels A prequel, No Place Like Oz, was released in e-book format on November 12, 2013 through HarperCollins. The story is set before the events in Dorothy Must Die, but after Dorothy's first trip to Oz. It follows Dorothy as she decides to return to Oz, because she misses the adventure, fame, and vibrancy of the magical world. Her life in Kansas is so lackluster that she returns regardless of the cost to others. Another prequel, The Witch Must Burn, was later published, and a third, The Wizard Returns, was published with the first two in book form in March 2015. The fourth novella, Heart of Tin, was released on July 28, 2015. The fifth novella, The Straw King, was released on November 10, 2015, and the sixth novella, Ruler of Beasts, was released on February 16, 2016. The three were released in a paperback book titled Dorothy Must Die Stories: Volume #2. Amazon has listed a seventh novella Order of the Wicked, released June 28, 2016. The eighth novella Dark Side of the Rainbow was published January 31, 2017. Sequels A sequel titled The Wicked Will Rise was published on March 30, 2015, following the events of Dorothy Must Die. The third installment of the series titled Yellow Brick War was published on March 15, 2016. The fourth and final book, The End of Oz, was released on March 14, 2017. Adaptation In 2013 The CW was reportedly in negotiations to produce a television series based upon the series. However, no further details have been announced. Reception Nerdist gave Dorothy Must Die a positive review, commenting that \\"In less skilled hands, all this could make for a trite take on well-worn territory. But Paige gives Amy a strong voice and an even stronger point of view.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave a mostly positive review, stating \\"In the end, it‚Äôs just another violent dystopian series opener for all its yellow-brick veneer, but it‚Äôs a whole lot more fun than many of its ilk.\\" A senior editor for the School Library Journal praised the work as being \\"gory, grim, and fast-paced\\".

The episode received positive reviews, with critics remarking on the homage the series paid to theories that evolved due to contributions from Isaac Newton, Nicolaus Copernicus, Edmond Halley, and Robert Hooke. Despite positive reviews, however, the episode received a 1.7/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 4.25 million American viewers watching it live.  Episode summary  The episode begins with Tyson describing how we were born into this world without an explanation of our surroundings, much like a baby abandoned on a doorstep. To help us learn about our surroundings, Tyson explains how we manifested pattern recognition early in mankind, sharpening over eons of evolution. We distinguished predator from prey; and poisonous plants from nourishing ones - enhancing our chance to live and reproduce, and passing on our genes. We used pattern recognition in astronomy and astrology, where different cultures, recognizing the patterns of stars in the skies, projected different symbols and pictures for constellations. We used it to predict the passing of the seasons, including how every culture determined that the passage of a comet was taken as an omen. Tyson continues to explain that the origin of comets only became known in the 20th century due to the work of Jan Oort and his hypothesis of the Oort cloud. Tyson then continues to relate the collaboration Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton in the last part of the 17th century in Cambridge. The collaboration would result in the publication of Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, the first major work to describe the laws of physics in mathematical terms, challenging the prevailing notion that God had planned out the heavens, and against objections and claims of plagiarism from Robert Hooke, and financial difficulties of the Royal Society of London. Tyson explains how Newton's work would influence many factors of life, including modern space flight. Tyson further describes Halley's contributions including determining Earth's distance to the sun, the motion of stars and predicting of the orbit of the then-unnamed Halley's comet using Newton's laws. Tyson contrasts these scientific approaches to understanding the galaxy compared to what early mankind had done. The episode ends with animation of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies merging based on the principles of Newton's laws.  Reception  The episode's premiere on Fox brought a 1.7/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 4.25 million American viewers watching it live. It placed fourth and last in its timeslot behind Resurrection, The Amazing Race All-Stars, and Believe; and thirteenth out of eighteenth for the night.

The lake is the largest lake in Djursland and is located about 6 km north of Ebeltoft. 150 years ago the lake was surrounded by moor land as the original oak forest had been depleted due to human intervention. To prevent sand drift the area was afforested, and 62 square kilometers of forest surrounds the lake today, consisting primarily of Norwegian fir and spruce, with some alder in low-lying areas. Otters, which are rare in Denmark, live by the lake, just as the lake is a resting and foraging grounds for migrating birds to and from the rest of Scandinavia. Several large species of birds of prey can be seen by the lake. In 1963 Lake Stubbe and adjacent woodland (381 ha) was reserved as protected in order preserve the landscape. Lake Stubbe is also an EU-habitat area, just as the area is part of Mols Bjerge National Park established in 2009. Publicly accessible Ornithological Society land on the North shore Access Public access to the lake is hampered by a wall of reed surrounding most of the lake. There is a 2 km unpaved public road close to the southern shore through woodland. This road is a suitable starting point for walks including mushroom picking in the woods in late summer and autumn. On the North-eastern shore of Lake Stubbe the Danish Ornithological Society has built a public bird watching tower, that can be reached by foot via a former railroad track passing the lakes eastern side leading to the town of Ebeltoft 5 km south of the lake. The Society also owns a bird sanctuary on the north side of the lake. Here public access is possible by foot to a part of the lake where there are openings in the reed belt along the shore. Biomanipulation Streams leading to the lake are spawning grounds for sea trout. Lake fishlife includes perch, pike, bream, roach and walleye. Around year 2000 a seemingly failed state-initiated biomanipulation project was carried out, in an attempt to make the lake water clearer. In summer Lake Stubbe can be green with algae. Part of the project was to fish up in the order of 1000 tons of roach and bream with nets, as these fish eat daphnia and copepods, small crustaceans, that devour the algae that make the water green. The idea was, that with less algae, the water would become clearer. Algae blossom is an indication of nutrient rich water. A large number of pike fry was also released, as pike eat bream and roach. Ditches with nutrient rich water from a summer cottage area north of the lake was also cut off. In 2014 + 10 years after the biomanipulation effort, the lake still becomes green with algae in summer, indicating the attempt was in vain. The tipping balance between a clear lake type and a murky green lake type can be part of a natural cycle in lakes over years, alternating between the two separate biological states. A biologist has suggested that a missing factor might have been to raise the level of the lake in spring by some decimeters, thus flooding low-lying land, in order to increase the amount of suitable breeding grounds for pike, that eat bream and roach. This would have involved flooding privately owned land.

During the Second French Empire, the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (1852‚Äì1870), Paris was the largest city in continental Europe and a leading center of finance, commerce, fashion, and the arts. The population of the city grew dramatically, from about one million to two million persons, partly because the city was greatly enlarged, to its present boundaries, through the annexation of eleven surrounding communes and the subsequent creation of eight new arrondissements. In 1853, Napoleon III and his prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, began a massive public works project, constructing new boulevards and parks, theaters, markets and monuments, a project that Napoleon III supported for seventeen years until his downfall in 1870, and which was continued afterward under the Third Republic. The street plan and architectural style of Napoleon III and Haussmann are still largely preserved and manifestly evident in the center of Paris. The Paris of Napoleon III Napoleon III by Alexandre Cabanel (about 1865) Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, was born in Paris, but spent very little of his life there until he assumed the presidency of the French Second Republic in 1848. Earlier, he had lived most of his life in exile in Switzerland, Italy, the United States, and England. At the time of his election as the French president, he had to ask Victor Hugo where the Place des Vosges was located. He was greatly influenced by London, where he had spent years in exile; he admired its squares, wide streets, sidewalks, and especially Hyde Park with its lake and winding paths, which he later copied in the Bois de Boulogne and other Paris parks. In 1852, Paris had many beautiful buildings; but, according to many visitors, it was not a beautiful city. The most significant civic structures, such as the H√¥tel de Ville and the Cathedral of Notre Dame, were surrounded and partially hidden by slums. Napoleon wanted to make them visible and accessible.De Moncan, Patrice, Le Paris d'Haussmann, p. 33. Napoleon III was fond of quoting the utopian philosopher Charles Fourier: \\"A century which does not know how to provide luxurious buildings can make no progress in the framework of social well- being... A barbarian city is one composed of buildings thrown together by hazard, without any evident plan, and grouped in confusion between twisting, narrow, badly-made and unhealthy streets.\\" In 1850, he declared: \\"Let us make every effort to embellish this great city. Let us open new streets, make healthy the crowded arrondissements which are lacking air and daylight, and let the healthy sunlight penetrate every corner within our walls.\\"De Moncan, Patrice, Le Paris d'Haussmann, p. 28. When Napoleon III staged a coup d'√©tat to become Emperor in December 1852, he began to transform Paris into a more open, healthier, and more beautiful city. He immediately attacked the major flaws of the city: overcrowded and unhealthy slums, particularly on the Ile de la Cit√©; the shortage of drinking water; sewers that emptied directly into the Seine; the absence of parks and green spaces, especially in the outer parts of the city; congestion in the narrow streets; and the need for easier travel between the new train stations. Haussmann's renovation of Paris The new boulevards and parks built by Haussmann during the Second Empire In 1853, Napoleon III assigned his new prefect of the Seine department, Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, the task of bringing more water, air, and light into the city center, widening the streets to make traffic circulation easier, and making it the most beautiful city in Europe. Haussmann worked on his vast projects for seventeen years, employing tens of thousands of workers. He rebuilt the sewers of Paris so they no longer emptied into the Seine and built a new aqueduct and reservoir to bring in more fresh water. He demolished most of the old medieval buildings on the √éle de la Cit√© and replaced them with a new hospital and government buildings. In the city center, he conceived four avenues arranged as a huge cross: a north‚Äìsouth axis connecting the Gare de Paris-Est in the north with the Paris Observatory in the south, and an east‚Äìwest axis from the Place de la Concorde along the Rue de Rivoli to the Rue Saint-Antoine. He built new, wide avenues, including the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the Avenue de l'Op√©ra, Avenue Foch (originally Avenue de l'imp√©ratrice), Avenue Voltaire, the Boulevard de S√©bastopol and Avenue Haussmann. He planted more than one hundred thousand trees along the new avenues. Where they intersected, he built new squares, fountains, and parks, to give a more harmonious appearance to the city. He imposed strict architectural standards for the buildings along the new boulevards: they all had to be the same height, follow a similar design, and be faced with the same cream-hued stone. This gave the Paris boulevards the distinctive appearance they retain to the present day.Meneglier, Herve, Paris Imperial- La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, (1992), Armand Colin, () For the recreation and relaxation of all classes of Parisians, Napoleon III created four new parks at the cardinal points of the compass: the Bois de Boulogne to the west, the Bois de Vincennes to the east, the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont to the north, and Parc Montsouris to the south.De Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, Les Editions du Mecene, () To better connect his capital with the rest of France, and to serve as the grand gateways to the city, Napoleon III built two new train stations, the Gare du Nord and the Gare d'Austerlitz, and rebuilt the Gare de Paris-Est and the Gare de Lyon. To revitalize the cultural life of the city, he demolished the old theater district, the \\"Boulevard du Crime\\", replaced it with five new theaters, and commissioned a new opera house, the Palais Garnier, as the new home of the Paris Opera, and the centerpiece of his downtown reconstruction. He also completed the Louvre, left unfinished since the French Revolution, built a new central market of gigantic glass and iron pavilions at Les Halles, and constructed new markets in each of the arrondissements.Meneglier, Herve, Paris Imperial- La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, (1992), Armand Colin, () Paris expands ‚Äì the annexation of 1860 An editorial cartoon of 1858 illustrates the opposition of many residents of the Paris suburbs to Napoleon III's plan to make them part of the city. In 1859, Napoleon III issued a decree annexing the suburban communes around Paris: La Villette, Belleville, Montmartre, Vaugirard, Grenelle, Auteuil, Passy, Batignolles, La Chapelle, Charonne, Bercy, and parts of Neuilly, Clichy, Saint-Ouen, Aubervilliers, Pantin, Le Pr√©-Saint-Gervais, Saint-Mand√©, Bagnolet, Ivry-sur- Seine, Gentilly, Montrouge, Vanves, and Issy-les-Molineaux. All of them became part of the city of Paris in January 1860. Their residents were not consulted and were not entirely pleased, since it meant having to pay higher taxes; but there was no legal recourse available to them. The area of the city expanded to its present boundaries and jumped in population from 1,200,000 to 1,600,000. The annexed areas were organized into eight new arrondissements; Haussmann enlarged his plans for Paris to include new city halls, parks and boulevards to connect the new arrondissements to the center of the city.Sarmant, Thierry, (2012), Histoire de Paris- Politique, Urbanisme, civilization, () ,p. 186 The population of Paris during the Second Empire The population of Paris was recorded as 949,000 in 1851. It grew to 1,130,500 by 1856 and was just short of two million by the end of Second Empire, including the 400,000 residents of the suburbs annexed to Paris in 1860.de Moncan, Patrice, Le Paris d'Haussmann, p. 169 According to a census made by the city of Paris in 1865, Parisians lived in 637,369 apartments or residences. Forty-two percent of the city population, or 780,000 Parisians, were classified as indigent, and thus too poor to be taxed. Another 330,000 Parisians, who occupied 17 percent of the housing of the city, were classified as lower middle class, defined as individuals who paid rents of less than 250 francs. 32 percent of the lodgings in Paris were occupied by the upper-middle class, defined as individuals who paid rents of between 250 and 1500 francs. Three percent of Parisians, or fifty thousand people, were classified as wealthy individuals who paid more than 1500 francs for rent.de Moncan, Patrice, Le Paris d'Haussmann =Artisans and workers= The interior of a Paris chocolate factory in 1855 In the early part of the 19th century, the majority of Parisians were employed in commerce and small shops; but by the mid-19th century, conditions had changed. In 1864, 900,000 of the 1,700,000 inhabitants of Paris were employed in workshops and industry. These workers were typically employed in manufacturing, usually for the luxury market and on a small scale. The average atelier, or workshop, employed only one or two workers.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 43. Similar types of manufacturing tended to be located in particular areas of the city. Furniture- makers and craftsmen who worked with bronze were located in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine; makers of tassels were found in the Faubourg Saint-Denis; shops that specialized in fabric trimming and fringes (passementerie) were found (and are still found) in the Temple area. Often the workshops were found in old houses on side streets. Thousands of crafts worked at home, making everything from watch chains to shoes and clothing. A large garment business could employ four thousand men and women, most working at home. In the Temple area, twenty-five thousand workers worked for five thousand employers.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 44-45 The market for Parisian products changed during the Second Empire. Previously, the clientele for luxury goods had been very small, mostly restricted to the nobility; and to meet their needs a small number of craftsmen had worked slowly and to very high standards. During the Second Empire, with the growth of the number of wealthy and upper middle class clients, lower-paid specialist craftsmen began to make products in greater quantity and more quickly, but of poorer quality than before. Craftsmen with nineteen different specialties were employed to make high-quality Moroccan leather goods. To make fine dolls, separate craftsmen and women, working separately and usually at home, made the body, the head, the arms, the teeth, the eyes, the hair, the lingerie, the dresses, the gloves, the shoes, and the hats.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 44 Between 1830 and 1850, more heavy industry began to locate in Paris. One tenth of all the steam engines in France were made in the capital. These industrial enterprises were usually located in the outer parts of the city, where there was land and access to the rivers or canals needed to move heavy goods. The metallurgy industry established itself along the Seine in the eastern part of the city. The chemical industry was located near La Villette, in the outer part of the city, or at Grenelle. Factories were established to make matches, candles, rubber, ink, gelatine, glue, and various acids. A thousand workers were employed by the Gouin factory in Batignolles to make steam engines. Fifteen hundred were employed by the Cail factories in Grenelle and Chaillot to make rails and ironwork for bridges. At Levallois-Perret, a young engineer, Gustave Eiffel, started an enterprise to make the frames of iron buildings. The eastern part of the city was subjected to noise, smoke, and the smells of industry. Wealthier Parisians moved to the west end of the city, which was quieter and where the prevailing winds kept out the smoke from the east. When the wealthy and middle-class people deserted the eastern areas, most of the small shops also closed and relocated elsewhere, leaving the outer suburbs of eastern Paris with only factories, and housing occupied by the poor.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 44-45 =Wages and working hours= The artisans and workers of Paris had a precarious existence. 73% of the residents of the working-class areas earned a daily salary between 3.25 and 6 francs; 22% earned less than three francs; only 5% had a salary between 6.5 and 20 francs. Food cost a minimum of one franc a day, and the minimum necessary for lodging was 75 centimes a day. In most industries, except those connected with food, there was a long morte-saison (\\"dead season\\"), when the enterprises closed down and their workers were unpaid. To support a family properly, either the wife and children had to work, or the husband had to work on Sundays or longer hours than normal. The situation for women was even worse; the average salary for a woman was only two francs a day. Women workers also faced increasing competition from machines: two thousand sewing machines, just coming into use, could replace twelve thousand women sewing by hand. Women were typically laid off from work before men.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 50. The workday at three-quarters of the enterprises in Paris was twelve hours, with two hours allowed for lunch. Most workers lived far from their place of employment, and public transport was expensive. A train on the inner circle line cost 75 centimes round-trip, so most workers walked to work with a half-kilogram loaf of bread for their lunch. Construction workers on Haussmann's grand projects in the city center had to leave home at 4 a.m. to arrive at work by 6 a.m., when the their workday began. Taverns and wine merchants near the work sites were open at a very early hour; it was common for workers to stop for a glass of white wine before work to counter the effects of what they had drunk the night before. Office workers were not paid much better than artisans or industrial workers. The first job of novelist √âmile Zola, in May 1862, was working as a mail clerk for the book publisher Louis Hachette; he put books into packets and mailed them to customers, for which he was paid 100 francs a month. In 1864, he was promoted to head of publicity for the publisher at a salary of 200 francs a month.Zola, √âmile, Nana (Vie d'√âmile Zola), p. 524-25 =The chiffonniers of Paris= chiffonier (1852), who each night searched through refuse for anything that could be salvaged. The chiffonniers (sometimes translated \\"rag-pickers\\" in English) were the lowest class of Paris workers; they sifted through trash and garbage on the Paris streets for anything that could be salvaged. They numbered about twelve thousand at the end of the Second Empire. Before the arrival of the poubelle, or rubbish bin, during the Third Republic, trash and garbage were simply dumped onto the street. The lowest level of chiffoniers searched through the common refuse; they had to work very quickly, because there was great competition, and they feared that their competitors would find the best objects first. The placier was a higher class of chiffonier, who took trash from the houses of the upper classes, usually by arrangement with the concierge. The placier provided certain services, such as beating carpets or cleaning doorways, and in exchange was able to get more valuable items, from silk and satin to old clothing and shoes to leftovers from banquets. Six houses on the Champs- Elysees were enough to provide for the family of a placier. The next level up was the chineur, a merchant who bought and resold trash, such as old bottles and corks from taverns, old clothes and bits of iron. At the top of the hierarchy were the ma√Ætre-chiffoniers, who had large sheds where trash was sorted and then resold. Almost everything was re-used: old corks were sold to wine-merchants; orange peels were sold to distillers; bones were used to make dominoes, buttons, and knife handles; cigar butts were resold; and stale bread was burned and used to make a cheap coffee substitute. Human hair was collected, carefully sorted by colour, length, and texture, and used to make wigs and hair extensions.Mangelier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 73-74 =The poor and indigent= Twenty-two percent of Parisians earned less than three francs a day, and daily life was a struggle for them. Their numbers grew as new immigrants arrived from other regions of France. Many came to the city early in the Empire to perform the unskilled work needed in demolishing buildings and moving earth for the new boulevards. When that work ended, few of the new immigrants left. The city established bureaux de bienfaisance‚Äîor charity bureaus, with an office in each arrondissement‚Äîto provide temporary assistance, usually in the form of food, to the unemployed, the sick, the injured, and women who were pregnant. The assistance ended when the recipients recovered; the average payment was 50 francs per family per year. Those who were old or had incurable illnesses were sent to a hospice. 130,000 people received this assistance, three-quarters of them immigrants from outside Paris. The public aid was supplemented by private charities, mostly operated by the church, which established a system of cr√®ches for poor children and weekly visits by nuns to the homes of the sick and new mothers.Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 50 For those working-class Parisians who had been laid off or were temporarily in need of money, a special institution existed: the Mont-de-Pi√©t√©. Founded in 1777, it was a sort of pawn shop or bank for the poor, with a main office on the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois and bureaus in twenty arrondissements. The poor could bring any piece of property, from jewels or watches to old sheets, mattresses, and clothing, and receive a loan. In 1869, it received more than 1,500,000 deposits in exchange for loans, two-thirds of which were of less than ten francs. The interest rate on the loans was 9.5 percent, and any object not claimed within a year was sold. The institution collected between 1000 and 1200 watches a day. Many clients used the same watch or object to borrow money every month, when money ran short. Workers would often pawn their tools during a slow season without work. Below the poor, there was an even lower class, of beggars and vagabonds. A law passed in 1863 made it a crime to be completely without money; those without any money at could be taken to jail, and those unlikely to get any money were taken to the D√©p√¥t de mendicit√©, or beggar's depot, located in Saint-Denis, where about a thousand beggars were put to work making rope or straps, or sorting rags. They were paid a small amount, and when they had earned a certain sum, they were allowed to leave, but most soon returned; and the majority died at the depot.Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 60-61 The morgue The Paris morgue in 1855, where bodies found floating in the Seine were put on display so they could be identified. The Paris morgue was located on the Quai de l'Archev√™ch√© on the √éle de la Cit√©, not far from the Cathedral of Notre-Dame- de-Paris. In order to assist with the identification of unclaimed bodies, it was open to the public. Bodies fished out of the Seine were put on display behind a large glass window, along with the clothes that they had been wearing. A doctor working at the morgue wrote, \\"A multitude of the curious, of all ages, sexes, and social rank, presses in every day, sometimes moved and silent, often stirred by horror and disgust, sometimes cynical and turbulent.\\"Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 68-69 On June 28, 1867, a body found without a head, arms or legs was put on display. The head, arms, and legs were found a few days later, the body was identified, and the murderer tracked down and arrested. The system was macabre but effective; seventy-five percent of the bodies found in the Seine were identified in this way.Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 68-69 The cemeteries During the Second Empire, Paris had five main cemeteries: P√®re Lachaise, Montparnasse, Montmartre, Saint-Ouen, and Ivry-sur-Seine. In addition, there were several smaller communal cemeteries. Funeral parlors offered seven different styles of burial, ranging in price from 18 francs to more than 7,000 francs for an elaborate individual monument. Two thirds of Parisians, however, were buried in collective graves in a corner of the cemeteries, with the cost paid by the city. Before Napoleon III, the corpses of indigents were simply piled into trenches in seven layers, each covered with a thin layer of earth and lime. Napoleon III had the process made somewhat more dignified, with the corpses laid side-by-side in a single layer in a trench. The city would pay for a priest who, if requested, would provide a short service and scatter holy water on the trench. Indigents who died in hospitals and those whose bodies had been dissected in medical schools continued to be buried in the more crowded trenches. For all indigent burials, the bodies remained in the trenches only long enough for them to decompose, no longer than five years. After that time, all remains were dug up and transferred to an ossuary, so that the space could be used for new burials.Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 65-66 In 1860, Haussmann complained that the cemeteries inside the city posed a serious threat to public health, and proposed to ban burials in the city. His alternative was to have all burials take place in a very large new cemetery, outside the city, served by special funeral trains that would bring the remains and the mourners from the city. Haussmann quietly began acquiring land for the new cemetery. The project ran into strong opposition in the French Senate in 1867, however, and Napoleon decided to postpone it indefinitely.Maneglier, Herv√©. Paris Imp√©rial p. 66-68 Public transport =Railroads and stations= The new Gare du Nord station (1866) was the ceremonial gateway to Paris, crowned by statues representing the cities of northern France. In 1863, Paris had eight passenger train stations that were run by eight different companies, each with rail lines connecting to a particular part of the country: the Gare du Nord connected Paris to Great Britain via ferry; the Gare de Strasbourg‚Äînow the Gare de l'Est‚Äîto Strasbourg, Germany, and eastern Europe; the Gare de Lyon‚Äîrun by the Company Paris-Lyon- Mediterran√©e‚Äîto Lyon and the south of France; the Gare d'Orleans‚Äînow the Gare d'Austerlitz‚Äîto Bordeaux and southwest France; the Gare d'Orsay; the Gare de Vincennes; the Gare de l'Ouest Rive Gauche‚Äîon the Left Bank where the Gare Montparnasse is today‚Äîto Brittany, Normandy, and western France; and the Gare de l'Ouest‚Äîon the Right Bank, where the Gare Saint-Lazare is today‚Äîalso connecting to the west. In addition, there was a huge station just outside the fortifications of the city where all freight and merchandise arrived.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris - ses organes, ses fonctions et sa vie dans le seconde moitie du XIXe si√®cle (1871). The owners and builders of the railroad stations competed to make their stations the most palatial and magnificent. The owner of the Gare du Nord, James Mayer de Rothschild, stated that arriving at his station would have \\"an imposing effect, due to the grandeur of the station.\\"Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 134. He completely demolished the old station and hired Jacques Hittorff, a classical architect who had designed the Place de la Concorde, to create the new station. The monumental facade included twenty- three statues by famous sculptors, representing the cities of northern France served by the company. At its opening in 1866, it was described as \\"a veritable temple of steam.\\"Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 136. The Gare de l'Ouest, on the right bank, the busiest of the stations, occupied eleven hectares and was home to a fleet of 630 locomotives and 13,686 passenger coaches, including those for first class, second class, and third class. 70 trains a day operated in the peak season and during the Paris expositions. If passengers needed to make a connection, a service of 350 horse-drawn omnibuses operated by the railroad carried passengers to the other stations. The journey from Paris to Orl√©ans, a distance of 121 kilometers, cost 13 francs 55 centimes for a first-class ticket; 10 francs 15 centimes for a second class ticket; and 7 francs 45 centimes for a 3rd class ticket.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris - ses organes, ses fonctions et sa vie dans le seconde moitie du XIXe si√®cle (1871). The engineers or drivers of the locomotives, called mechaniciens, had a particularly difficult job; the cabs of the locomotives had no roofs and no sides, and were exposed to rain, hail, and snow. In addition, it was scorching hot, since they had to work in front of the boiler. A locomotive driver earned 10 francs a day.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris - ses organes, ses fonctions et sa vie dans le seconde moitie du XIXe si√®cle (1871). The new train stations welcomed millions of tourists, including those who came for the two Universal Expositions during the Second Empire. They also welcomed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from other parts of France who came to work and settle in Paris. Immigrants from different regions tended to settle in areas close to the station that served their old region: Alsatians tended to settle around the Gare de l'Est and Bretons around the Gare de l'Ouest, a pattern still found today. =The omnibus and the fiacre= omnibus in the 1850s. In 1852, an enlarged omnibus on rails was inaugurated on the Cours-la-Reine. From 1828 to 1855, Parisian public transport was provided by private companies that operated large horse-drawn wagons with seats, a vehicle called an omnibus. The omnibuses of each company had distinct liveries and picturesque names: the Favorites, the Dames Blanches, the Gazelles, the Hirondelles, the Citadines. They served only the city center and wealthier areas, ignoring the working- class areas and the outer suburbs of the city. In 1855, Napoleon III's prefect of police, Pierre-Marie Pi√©tri, required the individual companies to merge under the name Compagnie g√©n√©ral de omnibus. This new company had the exclusive rights to provide public transport. It established 25 lines that expanded to 31 with the annexation of the outer suburbs, about 150 kilometers in total length. A ticket cost 30 centimes and entitled the passenger to one transfer. In 1855, the company had 347 cars and carried 36 million passengers. By 1865, the number of cars had doubled and the number of passengers had tripled.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 236-238 The Paris omnibus was painted in yellow, green, or brown. It carried fourteen passengers on two long benches and was entered from the rear. It was pulled by two horses and was equipped with a driver and conductor dressed in royal blue uniforms with silver-plated buttons, decorated with the gothic letter O, and with a black necktie. The conductor wore a kepi and the driver a hat of varnished leather. In summer, they wore blue and white striped trousers and black straw hats. The omnibus was required to stop any time a passenger wanted to get on or off, but with time, the omnibus became so popular that passengers had to wait in line to get a seat. The other means of public transport was the fiacre, a box-like coach drawn by one horse that could hold as many as four passengers, plus the driver, who rode on the exterior. In 1855, the many different enterprises that operated fiacres were merged into a single company, the Compagnie imp√©riale des voitures de Paris. In 1855, the company had a fleet of 6,101 fiacres with the emblem of the company on the door, and the drivers wore uniforms. The fiacres carried lanterns that indicated the area in which their depot was located: blue for Belleville, Buttes-Chaumont, and Popincourt; yellow for Rochechouart and the Pigalle; green for the Left Bank; red for Batignolles, Les Ternes, and Passy. The color of the lantern allowed customers leaving the theaters to know which fiacres would take them to their own area. The fare was 1.80 francs for a journey, or 2.50 francs for an hour. A wait of more than five minutes allowed the driver to demand payment for a full hour. The drivers were paid 1.5 francs per day for a working day that could last 15 to 16 hours. The company maintained a special service of plain-clothes agents to keep an eye on the drivers and make certain they submitted all the money they had collected. The fiacre was enclosed and upholstered inside with dark blue cloth. Fiacres figured prominently in the novels and poetry of the period; they were often used by clandestine lovers.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, 238-39. Gas lamps and the City of Light Gas lamp on the Place de l'√âtoile (now the Place Charles de Gaulle) The gas lights that illuminated Paris at night during the Second Empire were often admired by foreign visitors and helped give the city its nickname Ville-Lumi√©re, the City of Light. At the beginning of the Empire, there were 8,000 gas lights in the city; by 1870, there were 56,573 used exclusively to light the city streets.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris- ses organes, ses functions, et sa vie jusqu'en 1870, p. 596. The gas was produced by ten enormous factories‚Äîlocated around the edge of the city, near the circle of fortifications‚Äîand was distributed in pipes installed under the new boulevards and streets. Haussmann placed street lamps every twenty meters on the boulevards. Shortly after nightfall, a small army of 750 allumeurs in uniform, carrying long poles with small lamps at the end, went out into the streets, turned on a pipe of gas inside each lamppost, and lit the lamp. The entire city was illuminated within forty minutes. The amount of light was greatly enhanced by the white stone walls of the new Haussmann apartment buildings, which reflected the brilliant gaslight. Certain buildings and monuments were also illuminated: the Arc de Triomphe was crowned with a ring of gaslights, and they outlined the H√¥tel de Ville. The Champs-Elysees was lined with ribbons of white light. The major theaters, caf√©s, and department stores were also brightly lit with gaslight, as were some rooms in apartments in the new Haussmann buildings. The concert gardens, in which balls were held in summer, had gas lighting, as well as small gas lamps in the gardens, where gentlemen could light their cigars and cigarettes.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris- ses organes, ses functions, et sa vie jusqu'en 1870, p. 596. The central market ‚Äì Les Halles Les Halles, the central market of Paris, rebuilt by architect Victor Baltard between 1853 and 1870 with vast pavilions of cast iron and glass. Food arrived at Les Halles by wagon from a train station and was carried by porters called \\"les forts\\" (the strong) to pavilions where it was sold. The central market of Paris, Les Halles, had been in the same location on the Right Bank between the Louvre and the H√¥tel de Ville since it was established by King Philip II of France in 1183. The first market had walls and gates, but no covering other than tents and umbrellas. It sold food, clothing, weapons, and a wide range of merchandise. By the middle of the 19th century, the open-air market was overcrowded, unsanitary, and inadequate for the needs of the growing city. On September 25, 1851, Napoleon III, then Prince-President, placed the first stone for a new market. The first building looked like a grim medieval fortress and was criticised by the merchants, public, and the Prince-President himself. He stopped construction and commissioned a different architect, Victor Baltard, to come up with a better design. Baltard took his inspiration from The Crystal Palace in London, a revolutionary glass-and-cast-iron structure that had been built in 1851. Baltard's new design had fourteen enormous pavilions with glass and cast-iron roofs resting on brick walls. It covered an area of 70 hectares and cost 60 million francs to build. By 1870, ten of the fourteen pavilions were finished and in use. Les Halles was the major architectural achievement of the Second Empire and became the model for covered markets around the world.Du Camp, Maxime, L'Alimentation de Paris, Revue des Deux Mondes, T.74 (1868). Each night, 6000 wagons converged on Les Halles, carrying meat, seafood, produce, milk, eggs, and other food products from the train stations. The wagons were unloaded by 481 men wearing large hats called les forts (the strong), who carried the food in baskets to the pavilions. Pavilion no. 3 was the hall for meat; no. 9 for seafood; no. 11 for birds and game. Merchants in the pavilions rented their stalls for between one and three francs a day. Fruits and vegetables also arrived at night, brought by carts from farms and gardens around Paris; the farmers rented small spaces of one by two meters on the sidewalk outside the pavilions to sell their produce. The meat was carved, the produce put out on the counters, and the sellers‚Äîcalled \\"counter criers\\"‚Äîwere in place by 5 a.m., when the market opened. The first buyers in the morning were from institutions: soldiers with large sacks buying food for the army barracks; cooks buying for colleges, monasteries, and other institutions; and owners of small restaurants. Between six and seven in the morning, the fresh seafood arrived from the train stations, mostly from Normandy or Brittany, but some from England and Belgium. The fish were cleaned and put on the eight counters in hall no. 9. They were carefully arranged by sixteen verseurs (\\"pourers\\" or \\"spillers\\") and advertised in loud voices by 34 counter criers. As soon as the fish appeared, it was sold. From September 1 until April 30, oysters were sold in pavilion no. 12 for ten centimes each, which was too expensive for most Parisians. The oysters were shipped from Les Halles to customers as far away as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Butter, cheese, and eggs were sold in pavilion no. 10, the eggs having arrived in large packages containing a thousand eggs each. The butter and milk was checked and tasted by inspectors to make sure it matched advertised quality, and 65 inspectors verified the size and quality of the eggs. Pavilion no. 4 sold live birds: chickens, pigeons, ducks, and pheasants, as well as rabbits and lambs. It was by far the noisiest and the worst-smelling pavilion, because of the live animals; and it had a special ventilating system. No. 8 sold vegetables, and no. 7 sold fresh flowers. No. 12 had bakers and fruit sellers, and also sold what were known as rogations; these were leftovers from restaurants, hotels, the Palace, and government ministries. The leftovers were sorted and put on plates; and any that looked acceptable were sold. Some leftovers were reserved for pet foods; old bones were collected to make bouillon; uneaten bread crusts from schools and restaurants were used to make croutons for soup and bread- coating for cutlets. Many workers in Les Halles got their meals at this pavilion. Cooks from good restaurants arrived in the mid-morning to buy meat and produce, parking fiacres in rows in front of the Church of Saint-Eustache. Most of the food was sold by 10 a.m.; seafood remained on sale until noon. The rest of the day was used for recording orders, and for resting until whatever market opened again late that night.Du Camp, Maxime, L'Alimentation de Paris, Revue des Deux Mondes, T.74 (1868). Caf√©s and restaurants File:Caf√© Tortoni, Eugene von Guerard 1856.jpgThe Caf√© Tortoni, famous for its ice cream, on the Boulevard des Italiens (1856) File:Maison Dor√©e 1860.jpgThe Maison Dor√©e in about 1860. File:Caf√© Riche.jpgThe Caf√© Riche on the Boulevard des Italiens in about 1865 Thanks to the growing number of wealthy Parisians and tourists coming to the city and the new network of railroads that delivered fresh seafood, meat, vegetables, and fruit to Les Halles every morning, Paris during the Second Empire had some of the best restaurants in the world. The greatest concentration of top-class restaurants was on the Boulevard des Italiens, near the theaters. The most prominent of these at the beginning the Empire was the Caf√© de Paris, opened in 1826, which was located on the ground floor of the H√¥tel de Brancas. It was decorated in the style of a grand apartment, with high ceilings, large mirrors, and elegant furniture. The director of the Paris Op√©ra had a table reserved for him there, and it was a frequent meeting place for characters in the novels of Balzac. It was unable to adapt to the style of the Second Empire, however; it closed too early, at ten in the evening, the hour when the new wealthy class of Second Empire Parisians were just going out to dinner after the theatre or a ball. As a result, it went out of business in 1856.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 191. The most famous newer restaurants on the Boulevard des Italiens were the Maison Dor√©e, the Caf√© Riche, and the Caf√© Anglais, the latter two of which faced each other across the boulevard. They, and the other caf√©s modelled after them, had similar interior arrangements. Inside the door, the clients were welcomed by the dame de comptoir, always a beautiful woman who was very elegantly dressed. Besides welcoming the clients, she was in charge of the distribution of pieces of sugar, two for each demitasse of coffee. A demitasse of coffee cost between 35 and 40 centimes, to which clients usually added a tip of two sous, or ten centimes. An extra piece of sugar cost ten centimes. The floor of the caf√© was lightly covered with sand, so the hurrying waiters would not slip. The technology of the coffee service was greatly improved in 1855 with the invention of the hydrostatic coffee percolator, first presented at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, which allowed a caf√© to produce 50,000 demitasses a day.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 191. The Maison Dor√©e was decorated in an extravagant Moorish style, with white walls and gilded furnishings, balconies and statues. It had six dining salons and 26 small private rooms. The private dining rooms were elegantly furnished with large sofas as well as tables and were a popular place for clandestine romances. They also featured large mirrors, where women had the tradition of scratching messages with their diamond rings. It was a popular meeting place between high society and what was known as the demimonde of actresses and courtesans; it was a favorite dining place of Nana in the novel of that name by √âmile Zola.Zola, Emile, Nana, Folio Classique, (). The Caf√© Riche, located at the corner of the Rue Le Peletier and the Boulevard des Italiens, was richly decorated by its owner, Louis Bignon, with a marble and bronze stairway, statues, tapestries, and velour curtains. It was the meeting place of bankers, actors, actresses, and successful painters, journalists, novelists, and musicians. The upstairs rooms were the meeting places of the main characters in √âmile Zola's novel La Cur√©e. The Caf√© Anglais, across the street from the Caf√© Riche, had a famous chef, Adolphe Dugl√©r√©, whom the composer Gioachino Rossini, a frequent customer, described as \\"the Mozart of French cooking\\". The caf√© was also famous for its cave containing two hundred thousand bottles of wine. The caf√© occupied the ground floor; on the first floor there were twelve small private dining rooms and four larger dining salons decorated in white and gold. The largest and most famous was the Grand Seize, or \\"Grand Sixteen\\", where the most famous bankers, actors, actresses, aristocrats, and celebrities dined. In 1867, the \\"Grand Seize\\" was the setting for the Three Emperors Dinner, a sixteen-course dinner with eight wines consumed by Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, Czar Alexander II of Russia, his son the future Czar Alexander III of Russia, and the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The Boulevard des Italiens also featured the Caf√© Foy, at the corner of the Rue de la Chauss√©e-d'Antin, and the Caf√© Helder, a popular rendezvous for army officers. The caf√©s on the boulevard opened onto terraces, which were used in good weather. The Caf√© Tortoni, at 22 Boulevard des Italiens, which had been in place since the reign of Louis-Philippe, was famous for its ice cream. On summer days, carriages lined up outside on the boulevard as wealthy Parisians sent their servants into Tortoni to buy ice cream, which they consumed in their carriages. It was also a popular place to go after the theatre. Its regular clients included Gustave Flaubert and Eduard Manet.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 193. Just below the constellation of top restaurants, there were a dozen others that offered excellent food at less extravagant prices, including the historic Ledoyen, next to the Champs- Elys√©es, where the famous painters had a table during the Salon; others listed in a guidebook for foreign tourists were the caf√©s Br√©bant, Magny, Veron, Procope and Durand.Almanach de l'√©tranger a Paris, Guide pratique pour 1867, cited in Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial According to √âmile Zola, a full- course dinner in such a restaurant cost about 25 francs.Zola, Emile, Nana According to Eugene Chavette, author of an 1867 restaurant guide, there were 812 restaurants in Paris, 1,664 caf√©s, 3,523 debits de vin, 257 cr√©meries, and 207 tables d'h√¥tes.Chavette, Eugene, Restaurateurs et restaur√©s (1867), cited in Maneglier, Paris Imp√©rial. The latter were inexpensive eating places, often with a common table, where a meal could be had for 1.6 francs, with a bowl of soup, a choice of one of three main dishes, a dessert, bread, and a half- bottle of wine. As a guidebook for foreign visitors noted, \\"A few of these restaurants are truly good; many others are bad.\\" Ingredients were typically of poor quality. The soup was a thin broth of bouillon; as each spoonful of soup was taken from the pot, an equal amount of water was usually added, so the broth became thinner and thinner.Almanach de l'√©tranger a Paris, Guide pratique pour 1867, cited in Maneglier, Herve√©, Paris Imp√©rial Bread and wine Bread was the basic diet of the Parisian workers. There was one bakery for every 1349 Parisians in 1867, up from one bakery for every 1800 in 1853. However, the per capita daily consumption of bread of Parisians dropped during the Second Empire, from 500 grams per day per person in 1851 to 415 grams in 1873. To avoid popular unrest, the price of bread was regulated by the government and fixed at about 50 centimes per kilo. The fast-baked baguette was not introduced until 1920, so bakers had to work all night to bake the bread for the next day. In order to make a profit, bakers created a wide variety of what were known as \\"fantasy\\" breads, made with better quality flours and with different grains; the price of these breads ranged from 80 centimes to a franc per kilo.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 219 The consumption of wine by Parisians increased during the Second Empire, while the quality decreased. It was unusual for women to drink; but, for both the workers and the middle and upper classes, wine was part of the daily meal. The number of debits de boissons, bars where wine was sold, doubled. Ordinary wine was produced by mixing several different wines of different qualities from different places in a cask and shaking it. The wine sold as ordinary M√¢con was made by mixing wine from Beaujolais, Tavel, and Bergerac. The best wines were treated much more respectfully; in 1855, Napoleon III ordered the classification of Bordeaux wines by place of origin and quality, so that they could be displayed and sold at the Paris Universal Exposition. Wine was bought and sold at the Halle aux Vins, a large market established by Napoleon I in 1811, but not finished until 1845. It was located on the Left Bank of the Seine, on the Quai Saint Bernard, near the present-day Jardin des Plantes. It was on the river so that barrels of wine could be delivered by barge from Burgundy and other wine regions, and unloaded directly into the depot. The hand-made barrels were enormous and were of slightly different sizes for each region; barrels of Burgundy wine held 271 liters each. The Halle aux Vins covered fourteen hectares, and contained 158 wine cellars at ground level. It sold not only wine, but also liquors, spirits, vinegar, and olive oil. Wine merchants rented space in the cellars and halls that were located in four large buildings. All the wine and spirits were taxed; inspectors in the halls opened all the barrels, tested the wine to be certain it did not contain more than 18 percent alcohol, and one of 28 tasters employed by the Prefecture de Police tasted each to verify that it was, in fact, wine. Wine that contained more than 18 percent alcohol was taxed at a higher rate. The Halle sold 956,910 hectoliters of wine to Parisian caf√©s, bars, and local wine merchants in 1867.Du Camp, Maxime, Paris - ses organes, ses functions et sa vie jusqu'en 1870 (1878) p. 150-151. Absinthe and tobacco Absinthe had made its appearance in Paris in the 1840s, and it became extremely popular among the \\"Bohemians\\" of Paris: artists, writers, and their friends and followers. It was known as the \\"Goddess with green eyes,\\" and was usually drunk with a small amount of sugar on the edge of the glass. The hour of 5 p.m. was called l'heure verte (\\"the green hour\\"), when the drinking usually began, and it continued until late at night. Before the Second Empire, smoking had usually been limited to certain rooms or salons of restaurants or private homes, but during the Empire, it became popular to smoke on all occasions and in every location, from salons to the dining rooms of restaurants. Cigars imported from Havana were smoked by the Parisian upper class. To meet the growing demand for cigars, the government established two cigar factories in Paris. The one at Gros-Caillou was located on the banks of the Seine near the Palais d'Orsay; it was the place in which ordinary cigars were made, usually with tobacco from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Mexico, Brazil, or Hungary. The cigars from Gros-Caillou sold for between 10 and 20 centimes each. Another factory, at Reuilly, made luxury cigars with tobacco imported directly from Havana; they sold for 25 to 50 centimes each. The Reuilly factory employed a thousand workers, of whom 939 were women, a type of work culture in the tobacco industry depicted in the opera Carmen (1875) by Georges Bizet.

Bon March√©, the first modern department store, in 1867. The Second Empire saw a revolution in retail commerce, as the Paris middle class and consumer demand grew rapidly. The revolution was fuelled in large part by Paris fashions, especially the crinoline, which demanded enormous quantities of silk, satin, velour, cashmere, percale, mohair, ribbons, lace, and other fabrics and decorations. Before the Second Empire, clothing and luxury shops were small and catered to a very small clientele; their windows were covered with shutters or curtains. Any who entered had to explain their presence to the clerks, and prices were never posted; customers had to ask for them. The first novelty stores, which carried a wide variety of goods, appeared in the late 1840s. They had larger, glass windows, made possible by the new use of cast iron in architecture. Customers were welcome to walk in and look around, and prices were posted on every item. These shops were relatively small, and catered only to a single area, since it was difficult for Parisians to get around the city through its narrow streets. Innovation followed innovation. In 1850, the store named Le Grand Colbert introduced glass show windows from the pavement to the top of the ground floor. The store Au Coin de la Rue was built with several floors of retail space around a central courtyard that had a glass skylight for illumination, a model soon followed by other shops. In 1867, the store named La Ville Saint-Denis introduced the hydraulic elevator to retail. The new Haussmann boulevards created space for new stores, and it became easier for customers to cross the city to shop. In a short time, the commerce in novelties, fabrics, and clothing began to be concentrated in a few very large department stores. Bon March√© was opened in 1852, in a modest building, by Aristide Boucicaut, the former chief of the Petit Thomas variety store. Boucicaut's new venture expanded rapidly, its income growing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Boucicaut commissioned a new building with a glass and iron framework designed in part by Gustave Eiffel. It opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern department store. The Grand Magasin du Louvre opened in 1855 inside the vast luxury hotel built by the P√©reire brothers next to the Louvre and the Place Royale. It was the first department store that concentrated on luxury goods, and tried both to provide bargains and be snobbish. Other department stores quickly appeared: Printemps in 1865, the Grand Bazar de l'H√¥tel de Ville (BHV) in 1869, and La Samaritaine in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.Milza, Pierre, Napoleon III, p. 486 The new stores pioneered new methods of marketing, from holding annual sales to giving bouquets of violets to customers or boxes of chocolates to those who spent more than 25 francs. They offered a wide variety of products and prices: Bon March√© offered 54 kinds of crinolines, and 30 different kinds of silk. The Grand Magasin du Louvre sold shawls ranging in price from 30 francs to 600 francs.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 84-85 Painting during the Second Empire File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Birth of Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg\\"The Birth of Venus\\", by Alexandre Cabanel, was purchased by Napoleon III at the Paris Salon of 1863 File:Ernest Meissonier - Napoleon I in 1814.JPG\\"Napoleon I in 1814\\", a portrait of Napoleon III's uncle, by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier.

It was held every two years until 1861, and every year thereafter, in the Palais de l'Industrie, a gigantic exhibit hall built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. A medal from the Salon assured an artist of commissions from wealthy patrons or from the French government. Following rules of the Academy of Fine Arts established in the 18th century, a hierarchy of painting genres was followed: at the highest level was history painting, followed in order by portrait painting, landscape painting, and genre painting, with still-life painting at the bottom. Painters devoted great effort and intrigue to win approval from the jury to present their paintings at the Salon and arrange for good placement in the exhibition halls. The Paris Salon was directed by the Count √âmilien de Nieuwerkerke, the Superintendent of Fine Arts, who was known for his conservative tastes. He was scornful of the new school of Realist painters led by Gustave Courbet. One of the most successful Salon artists was Alexandre Cabanel, who produced a famous full-length portrait of Napoleon III, and a painting The Birth of Venus that was purchased by the Emperor at the Salon of 1863. Other successful academic painters of the Second Empire included Jean- Louis-Ernest Meissonier, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, and William-Adolphe Bouguereau.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, pp 173-174. =Ingres, Delacroix, Corot= File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg The Turkish Bath (1862) by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.

File:Camille Corot - Landschaft - ca1860.jpegA landscape (1860) by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot. Corot achieved popular and critical success during the Second Empire after a long period of relative obscurity. The older generation of painters in Paris during the Second Empire was dominated by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), the most prominent figure for history and neoclassical painting; Eug√®ne Delacroix (1798-1863), the leader of the romantic school of painting; and Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875), who was widely regarded as the greatest French landscape painter of the 19th century.Le Petit Robert (1988) Ingres had begun painting during the reign of Napoleon I, under the teaching of Jacques-Louis David. In 1853, during the reign of Napoleon III, he painted a monumental Apotheosis of Napoleon I on the ceiling of the Hotel de Ville of Paris, which was destroyed in May 1871 when the Communards burned the building. His work combined elements of neoclassicism, romanticism, and innocent eroticism. He painted his famed Turkish Bath in 1862, and he taught and inspired many of the academic painters of the Second Empire. Delacroix, as the founder of the Romantic school, took French painting in a very different direction, driven by emotion and colour. His friend the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote, \\"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible\\". Delacroix decorated the Chapelle des Saints-Anges at the Church of Saint-Sulpice with his frescoes, which were among his last works. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot began his career with study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts as an academic painter, but gradually began painting more freely and expressing emotions and feelings through his landscapes. His motto was \\"never lose that first impression which we feel.\\" He made sketches in the forests around Paris, then reworked them into final paintings in his studio. He was showing paintings in the Salon as early as 1827, but he did not achieve real fame and critical acclaim before 1855, during the Second Empire.Le Petit Robert (1988) =Courbet and Manet= File:Gustave Courbet 027.jpgGustave Courbet's painting of ordinary young women taking a nap by the Seine (1856) caused a scandal at the Paris Salon, much to the delight of the artist. File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpgLuncheon on the Grass by √âdouard Manet caused a scandal at the Paris Salon of 1863 and helped make Manet famous. Gustave Courbet (1819-1872) was the leader of the school of realist painters during the Second Empire who depicted the lives of ordinary people and rural life, as well as landscapes. He delighted in scandal and condemned the art establishment, the Academy of Fine Arts, and Napoleon III. In 1855, when his submissions to the Salon were rejected, he set up his own exhibit in a nearby building and displayed forty of his paintings there. In 1870, Napoleon III proposed giving the Legion of Honour to Courbet, but he publicly rejected it. √âdouard Manet was one of the first non-academic artists to achieve both popular and critical success during the Second Empire, thanks in part to a little help from Napoleon III. Manet's painting The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe) was rejected by the jury of the 1863 Paris Salon, along with many other non-academic paintings by other painters. Napoleon III heard complaints about the rejection and directed the Academy of Fine Arts to hold a separate exhibit, known as the Salon des Refus√©s (Salon of the Rejected), in the same building as the Salon. The painting was criticized and ridiculed by critics but brought Manet's work to the attention of a vast Parisian public. =Pre-Impressionism= File:Claude Monet - Camille.JPGClaude Monet exhibited a portrait of his future wife Camille Doncieux at the Paris Salon of 1866 under the title Woman in a Green Dress.

File:Degas - Das Ehepaar Manet.jpgA portrait of Manet and his wife by Edgar Degas. (1868‚Äì69) While the official art world was dominated by the Salon painters, another lively art world existed in competition with and opposition to the salon. In an earlier period, this group included the painters Gustave Courbet, √âdouard Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Alfred Sisley; then, later, Pierre-August Renoir, Fr√©d√©ric Bazille, and Henri Fantin-Latour. Their frequent meeting place was the Caf√© Guerbois at 11 Avenue de Clichy.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 196. The caf√© was close to the foot of Montmartre, where many of the artists had their studios. The artists interested in the new popularity of Japanese prints frequented the gallery of √âdouard Desoye or the L√©ger gallery on the Rue le Peletier. The painters also frequented the galleries that exhibited the new style of art, such as those of Paul Durand-Ruel, Ambroise Vollard, and Alexandre Bernheim on the Rue Laffitte and Rue le Peletier, or the gallery of Adolphe Goupil on the Boulevard Montmartre, where Th√©o van Gogh, the brother of Vincent Van Gogh, worked. The paintings of Manet could be seen at the gallery of Louis Martinet at 25 Boulevard des Italiens. The term \\"Impressionist\\" was not invented until 1874; but during the Second Empire, all the major impressionist painters were at work in Paris, inventing their own personal styles. Claude Monet exhibited two of his paintings, a landscape and a portrait of his future wife Camille Doncieux, at the Paris Salon of 1866. Edgar Degas (1834-1917), the son of a banker, studied academic art at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and travelled to Italy to study the Renaissance painters. In 1868, he began to frequent the Caf√© Guerbois, where he met Manet, Monet, Renoir, and the other artists of a new, more natural school, and began to develop his own style.Petit Robert, p. 504-505. Literature File:CharlesHugo.jpgVictor Hugo lived in exile on the island of Jersey during almost all of the period of the Second Empire, but his works, including Les Miserables of 1862, were immensely popular in Paris. File:Gustave Flaubert par Pierre Fran√ßois Eug√®ne Giraud.jpgGustave Flaubert published his novel Madame Bovary in 1866 and was charged with immorality for its content. He was acquitted, and the publicity made the novel a huge public success. File:√âmile Zola by Carjat.jpg√âmile Zola began his literary career as a shipping clerk for the Paris publisher Hachette. He published his first major novel, Th√©r√®se Raquin, in 1867. File:√âtienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpgCharles Baudelaire also faced charges of immorality, in his case for his poetry. He was fined, and six of his poems were suppressed. File:Jules Verne by √âtienne Carjat.jpgJules Verne worked at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique and the Paris stock market and did research for his first stories at the National Library. The most famous Paris writer of the Second Empire, Victor Hugo, spent only a few days in the city during the entire period of the Second Empire. He was exiled shortly after Napoleon III seized power in 1852, and he did not return until after Napoleon's fall in 1870. The emperor stated publicly that Hugo could return whenever he wanted; but Hugo refused as a matter of principle, and while in exile wrote books and articles ridiculing and denouncing Napoleon III. His novel Les Mis√©rables was published in Paris in April and May 1862 and was a huge popular success, though it was criticized by Gustave Flaubert, who said he found \\"no truth or greatness in it\\".Letter of G. Flaubert to Madame Roger des Genettes ‚Äì July 1862 Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) left Paris in 1851, just before the Second Empire was proclaimed, partly because of political differences with Napoleon III, but largely because he was deeply in debt and wanted to avoid creditors. After travelling to Belgium, Italy, and Russia, he returned to Paris in 1864 and wrote his last major work, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine, before he died in 1870. The son of Dumas, Alexandre Dumas fils (1824-1895), became the most successful playwright of the Second Empire. His 1852 drama The Lady of the Camellias ran for one hundred performances and was transformed into an opera, La Traviata by Giuseppe Verdi in 1853. After Victor Hugo, he most prominent writer of the Second Empire was Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880). He published his first novel, Madame Bovary, in 1857, and followed it with Sentimental Education and Salammbo in 1869. He and his publisher were charged with immorality for Madame Bovary. Both were acquitted, and the publicity from the trial helped make the novel a notable artistic and commercial success. The most important poet of the Second Empire was Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), who published Les fleurs du mal in 1860. He also ran into trouble with the censors, and was charged with an offense to public morality. He was convicted and fined, and six poems were suppressed, but he appealed, the fine was reduced, and the suppressed poems eventually appeared. His work was attacked by the critic of Le Figaro, who complained that \\"everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible\\", but Baudelaire's work and innovation had an enormous influence on the poets who followed him. The most prominent of the younger generation of writers in Paris was √âmile Zola (1840-1902). His first job in Paris was as a shipping clerk for the publisher Hacehtte; later, he served as the director of publicity for the firm. He published his first stories in 1864, his first novel in 1865, and had his first literary success in 1867 with his novel Th√©r√®se Raquin. Another important writer of the time was Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897), who became private secretary to the half-brother and senior advisor of Napoleon III, Charles de Morny. His book Lettres de mon moulin (1866) became a French classic. One of the most popular writers of the Second Empire was Jules Verne (1828-1905), who lived on what is now Avenue Jules-Verne. He worked at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange (the Paris Bourse), while he did research for his stories at the National Library. He wrote his first stories and novels in Paris, including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), From the Earth to the Moon (1864), and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1865). Architecture of the Second Empire File:Paris Opera full frontal architecture, May 2009.jpgThe Opera Garnier (1862-1875) File:GarnierOperaParis.jpgThe grand stairway of the Paris Opera, designed by Charles Garnier, in the style he called simply \\"Napoleon III\\" File:Central market, Paris, France.

File:Parc Monceau Grille d'entr√©e 001.jpgThe monumental gates of the Parc Monceau designed by the city architect Gabriel Davioud. The dominant architectural style of the Second Empire was eclecticism, drawing liberally from the Gothic and Renaissance styles, and the styles dominant during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The style was described by √âmile Zola, not an admirer of the Empire, as \\"the opulent bastard child of all the styles\\".Zola, Emile, Nana. The best example was the Opera Garnier, begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875. The architect was Charles Garnier (1825-1898), who won the competition for the design when he was only thirty-seven. When asked by the Empress Eug√©nie what the style of the building was called, he replied simply, \\"Napoleon III\\". At the time, it was the largest theater in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces: grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes. Another example was the Mairie, or city hall, of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, built in 1855-1861 in a neo- Gothic style by the architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff (1792-1867).Renault, Christophe and Laz√©, Christophe, Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. () The industrial revolution was beginning to demand a new kind of architecture: bigger, stronger, and less expensive. The new age of railways, and the enormous increase in travel that it caused, required new train stations, large hotels, exposition halls, and department stores in Paris. While the exteriors of most Second Empire monumental buildings usually remained eclectic, a revolution was taking place; based on the model of The Crystal Palace in London (1851), Parisian architects began to use cast-iron frames and walls of glass in their buildings.Renault, Christophe and Laz√©, Christophe, Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. The most dramatic use of iron and glass was in the new central market of Paris, Les Halles (1853-1870), an ensemble of huge iron and glass pavilions designed by Victor Baltard (1805-1874) and Felix-Emmanuel Callet (1792-1854). Jacques-Ignace Hittorff also made extensive use of iron and glass in the interior of the new Gare de Nord train station (1842-1865), although the facade was perfectly neoclassical, decorated with classical statues representing the cities served by the railway. Baltard also used a steel frame in building the largest new church built in Paris during the Empire, the Church of Saint Augustine (1860-1871). While the structure was supported by cast-iron columns, the facade was eclectic. Henri Labrouste (1801-1875) also used iron and glass to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the National Library, Richelieu site (1854-1875).Renault, Christophe and Laz√©, Christophe, 'Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier, (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot. () The Second Empire also saw the completion or restoration of several architectural treasures: the wings of the Louvre Museum were finally completed; the famed stained glass windows and structure of the Sainte-Chapelle were restored by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc; and the Cathedral of Notre Dame underwent extensive restoration. In the case of the Louvre, in particular, the restorations were sometimes more imaginative than historically authentic.

File:Cadira tipus confident, avantcambra del palau del marqu√©s de Dosaig√ºes.JPGThe chair for intimate conversations called le confident Comfort was the first priority of Second Empire furniture. Chairs were elaborately upholstered with fringes, tassels, and expensive fabrics. Tapestry work on furniture was very much in style. The structure of chairs and sofas was usually entirely hidden by the upholstery or had copper, shell, or other decorative elements as ornamentation. Novel and exotic new materials‚Äîsuch as bamboo, papier-m√¢ch√©, and rattan‚Äîwere used for the first time in European furniture, along with polychrome wood, and wood painted with black lacquer. The upholstered pouffe, or footstool, appeared, along with the angle sofa and unusual chairs for intimate conversations between two persons (Le confident) or three people (L'indiscret).

File:The Square of the Tuileries, 1870.jpgBy 1870, the crinoline had gone out of style, and women wore skirts that more closely fit the body. Women's fashion during the Second Empire was set by the Empress Eug√©nie. Until the late 1860s, it was dominated by the crinoline dress, a bell-shaped dress with a very wide, full-length skirt supported on a frame of hoops of metal. The dress's waist was extremely narrow, its wear facilitated by wearing a corset with whalebone stays underneath, which also pushed up the bust. The shoulders were often bare or covered by a shawl. The Archbishop of Paris noted that women used so much material in the skirt that none seemed to be left to cover their shoulders. Paris church officials also noted with concern that the pews in a church, which normally could seat one hundred people, could seat only forty women wearing such dresses, thus the Sunday intake of donations fell. In 1867, a young woman was detained at the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires for stealing umbrellas and hiding them under her skirt.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 78. The great expanse of the skirt was covered with elaborate lace, embroidery, fringes, and other decoration. The decoration was fantastic and eclectic, borrowing from the era of Louis XVI, the ancient Greeks, the Renaissance, or Romanticism. In the 1860s, the crinoline dress began to lose its dominance, due to competition from the more natural \\"style Anglais\\" (English style) that followed the lines of the body. The English style was introduced by the British couturier Charles Frederick Worth and Princess Pauline von Metternich. At the end of the 1860s, the empress herself began to wear the English style.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 78. In men's fashion, the long redingote of the era of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term \\"riding-coat\\") was gradually replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. The shorter jacket allowed a man to put his hands into his trouser pockets. The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and buttons of paste jewellery. Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order \\"to prove to the population that they had the means to buy a pair of gloves without using them.\\"Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 78. Opera, Theater and Amusement By the end of the Second Empire, Paris had 41 theaters that offered entertainment for every possible taste: from grand opera and ballet to dramas, melodramas, operettas, vaudeville, farces, parodies, and more. Their success was in part a result of the new railroads, which brought thousands of spectators from the French provinces and abroad. A popular drama that would have had a run of fifteen performances for a purely Parisian audience could now run for 150 performances with new audiences every night. Of these theaters, five had official status and received substantial subsidies from the Imperial treasury: the Op√©ra (800,000 francs a year); the Com√©die-Francaise (240,000 francs); the Op√©ra- Comique (140,000 francs); the Od√©on (60,000 francs), and the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique (100,000 francs).Du Camp, Maxime, Paris- ses organes, ses functions, et sa vie jusqu'en 1870, p. 675 =The Paris Opera= Theater of the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique on the Rue Le Peletier during a performance of ballet. It was the main opera house in Paris before the completion of the Palais Garnier in 1875. At the top of the hierarchy of Paris theaters was the Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial de l'Op√©ra (Imperial Opera Theater). The first stone of the new Paris opera house, designed by Charles Garnier, was laid in July 1862, but flooding of the basement caused the construction to proceed very slowly. Garnier himself had his office on the site to oversee every detail. As the building rose, it was covered with a large shed so that the sculptors and artists could create the elaborate exterior decoration. The shed was taken off on 15 August 1867, in time for the Paris Universal Exposition. Visitors and Parisians could see the building's glorious new exterior, but the inside was not finished until 1875, after the fall of the Empire in 1870. Op√©ra performances were held in the Salle Le Peletier, the theater of the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, on the Rue Le Peletier. It was at that opera house that, on 14 January 1858, a group of Italian extreme nationalists attempted to kill Napoleon III at the entrance, by setting off several bombs that killed eight people, injured 150, and splattered the empress with blood, although the emperor was unharmed. The opera house on the Rue Le Peletier could seat 1800 spectators. There were three performances a week, scheduled so as not to compete with the other major opera house in the city, the Th√©√¢tre-Italien. The best seats were in the forty boxes on the first balcony, which could each hold four or six persons. One of the boxes could be rented for the entire season for 7500 francs. One of the major functions of the opera house was to be a meeting place for Paris society, and for this reason the performances were generally very long, with as many as five intermissions. Ballets were generally added in the middle of operas to create additional opportunities for intermissions. Operas by the major composers of the time, notably Giacomo Meyerbeer and Richard Wagner, had their first French performances in this theater.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 188. The first French performance of Wagner's opera Tannh√§user, in March 1861, (with ballets choreographed by Marius Petipa) caused a scandal; most of the French critics and audience disliked both the music and personality of Wagner, who was present in the theater. Each performance was greeted with whistles and jeers from the first notes of overture; after three performances, the opera was pulled from the repertoire.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 188. Wagner got his revenge. In February 1871, he wrote a poem, \\"To the German Army before Paris\\", celebrating the German siege of the city, which he sent to German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck wrote back to Wagner, \\"you too have overcome the resistance of the Parisians after a long struggle.\\"Von Westernhagen, Curt, Wagner - A Biography, Cambridge University Press (1979) =The Th√©√¢tre Italien, the Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique, and the Op√©ra- Comique= File:Press illustration of the interior of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique (Place du Ch√¢telet) during 'Don Quichotte' 1869 - NGO 3p872.jpgThe Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, on the Place du Chatelet, in 1869.

This engraving depicts the last scene of a production of the opera Rienzi by Richard Wagner in 1869. File:Salle Ventadour - Levin p390.jpgThe Salle Ventadour was the home of the Th√©√¢tre-Italien. The first French performances of the operas of Verdi were staged there, and the famed soprano Adelina Patti sang there regularly during the Second Empire. Besides the Imperial Opera Theater, Paris had three other important opera houses: the Th√©√¢tre Italien, the Op√©ra-Comique, and the Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique. The Th√©√¢tre Italien was the oldest opera company in Paris. During the Second Empire, it was based in the Salle Ventadour and hosted the French premieres of many of Verdi's operas, including Il Trovatore (1854), La Traviata (1856), Rigoletto (1857), and Un ballo in maschera (1861). Verdi conducted his Requiem there, and Richard Wagner conducted a concert of selections from his operas. The soprano Adelina Patti had an exclusive contract to sing with at the Th√©√¢tre Italien when she was in Paris. The Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique was originally located on the Rue de Temple, the famous \\"Boulevard du Crime\\" (so-called for all of the crime melodramas that were staged there); but when that part of the street was demolished to make room for the Place de la Republique, Napoleon III built the company a new theater at the Place du Ch√¢telet. The Lyrique was famous for putting on operas by new composers. It staged the first French performance of Rienzi by Richard Wagner; the first performance of Les p√™cheurs de perles (1863), the first opera by the 24-year-old Georges Bizet; the first performances of the operas Faust (1859) and Rom√©o et Juliette (1867) by Charles Gounod; and the first performance of Les Troyens (1863) by Hector Berlioz. The Op√©ra-Comique was located in the Salle Favart and produced both comedies and serious works.

Operetta was a speciality of the Second Empire, and its master was the German-born composer and conductor Jacques Offenbach. He composed more than a hundred operettas for the Paris stage, including Orph√©e aux enfers (1858), La Belle H√©l√®ne (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), and La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein (1867). His operettas were performed with great success at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s and the Theatre des Bouffes-Parisiens, and he was given French citizenship and awarded the Legion of Honour by Napoleon III. The soprano Hortense Schneider was the star of his most famous operettas and was one of the most popular actresses on the stages of the Second Empire. One Paris operetta melody by Offenbach, Couplets des deux Hommes d'Armes, sung by two policemen in the operetta Genevi√®ve de Brabant (1868), won fame in an entirely different context: it became the melody of the Marine's Hymn, the song of the United States Marine Corps, in 1918. =The Boulevard du Crime, the Cirque Napoleon and the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville= File:Th√©√¢tre de la Gait√©, Boulevard du Temple, Paris, ca. 1855.jpgThe Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, located on the Boulevard du Crime until 1862, showed popular programs of vaudeville and melodrama.

File:Vue ext√©rieure du nouveau cirque Napol√©on, Boulevard des Filles-du-Calvaire.jpgThe Cirque d'Hiver, designed by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff, opened in 1852 as the Cirque Napol√©on.

At the beginning of the Second Empire, seven popular theaters were grouped side-by-side along the upper part of the Boulevard du Temple, an area known as the Boulevard du Crime because of the lurid melodramas that played there. Coming from the Place Ch√¢teau d'Eau, the first theater was the Th√©atre Lyrique, which had originally been built in 1847 by Alexander Dumas to stage plays based on his stories, but became an opera house. Next to it was the Cirque Olympique, which specialized in tableaux of romantic fairy tales and the battles of Napoleon. Farther down the street was the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Dramatiques, which alternated melodramas and vaudeville, and whose most famous star was the actor Fr√©d√©rick Lema√Ætre. Next to that theater was the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, which also alternated vaudeville and melodrama. The next theater was the Th√©√¢tre des Funambules. It was ancient, long, dark, and cramped. It had been made famous in 1828 from portrayals of the sad clown Pierrot by the mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, whose story is told in the 1945 film The Children of Paradise (Les Infants de Paradis). Next to the Funambules was the Th√©√¢tre des D√©lassements-Comiques, famous for vaudeville, pantomime, and dancing by beautiful women in costumes as scant as the censors would allow, including performing the Rigolboche, later known as the French can-can. The last theater in the group was Petit Lazary, the least expensive theater in Paris. It offered two shows a day, each of four vaudeville acts, as well as pantomime. For 15 centimes, a spectator could have a place in the Paradis, the upper balcony.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, pp. 204-206. The Cirque d'Hiver, or Cirque Napol√©on, was located about 100 meters further down the street. It was huge and new, built in 1852 to hold 4000 spectators. Beginning in 1859, it also featured performances by Jules L√©otard, a 28-year-old gymnast from Toulouse, who invented the flying trapeze and has been immortalized by the athletic garment named for him: the leotard. Performances on the boulevard began at 6 o'clock, but spectators began lining up outside several hours before. The popularity of an actor or theater was measured by the length of the line outside. Street merchants sold oranges, bouquets of flowers, baked apples, and ice cream to those waiting in line. Some spectators, particularly students, obtained discounted tickets by serving as part of the claque, applauding furiously when signalled by a theatre employee.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, pp. 208 The Boulevard du Crime came to an end by a decree of the Emperor in May 1862, because Haussmann's plan called for the enlargement of the neighboring Place du Ch√¢teau-d'Eau (now Place de la R√©publique) and the building of a new Boulevard Prince-Eug√®ne (now the Boulevard de la R√©publique). The largest theaters were relocated: the Ga√Æt√© was moved to the Square des Arts-et-M√©tiers, the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique moved to the enlarged Place du Ch√¢telet, as did the Cirque Olympique, which moved to the other side of the square and became the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. The demolition of the Boulevard du Crime began on 15 July 1862. The night before, the son of the famous mime Deburau performed in the final show at the Funambules dressed in a Pierrot costume that was black instead of white.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, pp. 210-211 The Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville was located outside the theater district on the Place de la Bourse. It hosted the first performance of one of the most famous plays of the period, The Lady of the Camellias by Alexandre Dumas fils, on 2 February 1852. It ran for 100 performances. Giuseppe Verdi attended one performance, and later created an opera, La Traviata, based on the story. =Promenades= File:Boulevard des Italiens, between 1860 and 1870.jpgThe Boulevard des Italiens between 1860 and 1870. File:Vue de l'Avenue du bois de Boulogne, ca. 1853‚Äì70.jpgThe Avenue de l'Imp√©ratrice (now the Avenue Foch) during the Second Empire. It was the grand entrance for promenades to the Bois de Boulogne. File:Les boulevards de Paris le jour de l'an.jpgA Paris boulevard on New Year's Day 1862. During the Second Empire, the promenade was an art form and a kind of street theater in which all classes of Parisians participated. It constituted a walk, a horseback ride, or a ride in a carriage entirely for pleasure, in order to see and be seen. It generally took place on the new boulevards, which had wide sidewalks and rows of trees, and in the new parks, which were designed exactly for that purpose. In 1852, Napoleon III created a new department, the Service des Promenades et Plantations, directly under the prefect Haussmann. The first director was Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, who designed all the new parks, avenues, small squares, and gardens in the city, including planting trees along the boulevards.de Moncan, Patrice, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, p. 23. The most popular promenade for the wealthier Parisians began at the Place de la Concorde, went up the Champs-Elysees to the Place de l'√âtoile, and then turned onto the Avenue de l'Imp√©ratrice (today the Avenue Foch), the widest avenue in the city, which was the ceremonial entry to the new Bois de Boulogne. Once in the park, the promenaders usually went to the cascade, or to one of the elegant new caf√©s in the park. On a fine day, the route was entirely filled with carriages, and there were often traffic jams. A promenade on this route opens and closes the novel La Cur√©e by √âmile Zola. =Balls at the Tuileries Palace, the Opera Ball and the Mabille Ball= File:PierreTetarVanElvenF√™teAuxTuileries10juin1867.JPGThe Tuileries Palace in 1867 during the Paris Universal Exposition.

File:Le bal Mabile, Champs-Elys√©es - NYPL Digital Collections.jpgThe Bal Mabille in 1858. Balls and theater were the major social events for Parisians during the Second Empire. The most prestigious of all were the balls held at the Tuileries Palace by the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eug√©nie. They gave three or four grand balls with 600 guests each year early in the new year. During carnival, there was a series of very elaborate costume balls on the themes of different countries and different historical periods, for which guests sometimes spent small fortunes on their costumes. During Lent, the balls were replaced by concerts by both professionals and amateurs. After Easter, the empress hosted a series of smaller balls for her friends until May. The masked balls at the Paris Opera on the Rue Le Peletier were the most famous. They were held about a dozen times during each season, on each Saturday evening during carnival. Their purpose was to raise funds for the Acad√©mie de la Musique, which ran the opera house. Entry for men cost ten francs, while women were admitted for half-price. Women looking for the opportunity to meet a wealthy banker or nobleman spent ten times or more on their costumes than the admission price. The seats were taken out of the parterre, and the doors opened at midnight. Those who merely wanted to watch the spectacle could rent boxes in the balcony. The attraction was to meet mysterious and interesting masked strangers. There were numerous anecdotes of surprises: a daughter who unknowingly tried to seduce her father, or a mother who tried to seduce her son.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 92-94 The Bal Mabille was an outdoor ball that rivalled the Opera Ball. It took place on the Avenue Montaigne, near the rond-point (roundabout) of the Champs-Elys√©es, in a large garden lit by hundreds of gas lamps. It was open on Saturday and Sunday evenings with an admission price of 5 francs on Saturday and 1.5 francs on Sunday. It was attended by aristocrats‚Äîsuch as the Princess Pauline von Metternich‚Äîby artists and musicians, and by wealthy foreign tourists. It introduced new dances to Paris, including the polka.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 87-89 See also * Napoleon III style References =Notes and citations= =Bibliography=    External links  * Paris: Capital of the 19th Century - Brown University Library Category:19th century in Paris Category:Second French Empire Category:History of Paris by period ","title":"Paris during the Second Empire"},{"id":"42293848","text":"Pink Lemonade is the second studio album by Australian rock band Closure in Moscow.

Attention - A life in Extremes is the first European documentary and the first Austrian film supporting Dolby Atmos.  Plot  Three exceptional athletes in the demanding field of extreme sport are followed. They fly along cliffs, dive without oxygen into the depths of the sea and prove the capabilities of the human body during the longest endurance bike race. What motives and thoughts have made them into modern day heroes? What causes the fascination for individuals who expose themselves to exceptional risks? The movie follows these people in the attempt to find the limits of performance. We get to know their environment, their companions, but also listen to critical voices. We hear the desires and fears of the families and venture, through the inner circle of friends, into the psyche of the athletes. And what motives are important for these pursuits? Is it the lust for fame? For immortality? For the absolute life experience?  Background  With the help of the three protagonists \\"Attention - a Life in Extremes\\", tells the story of human achievement. The movie highlights the world of high performance sport, as well as other facets of those people who use their body and even risk it in order to draw something special from their existence. The risks of the represented sports will be shown, and with the help of philosophers such as Paul Konrad Liessmann and psychologists such as Manfred Spitzer the extreme forms of sport are discussed.  Production  The documentary was shot in the United States, France, Norway, Germany, Austria South Tyrol.

The film is set in Rome where a Wax Museum has opened up, whose main attraction is gruesome murder scenes. Shortly after its opening, people began to vanish as new figures appear in the museum. After witnessing the poor state of Lucio Fulci's health in 1994, Dario Argento decided to help Fulci by working with him to develop a new project. The two eventually agreed upon a remake of House of Wax. Pre-production lasted longer than expected as Argento had been working on his own film The Stendhal Syndrome. Fulci died in 1996, which led to Argento having special effects artist Sergio Stivaletti enter to direct the film. Stivaletti changed the film's script to focus more on special effects. Plot The film begins with the murder of a couple in Paris during the year 1900 by a masked man with a metal claw that he uses to rip out their hearts. The sole survivor and witness to the massacre is a young girl, Sonia, who is discovered by an inspector searching the crime scene, Lanvin. Twelve years later a new wax museum is opened in Rome. The main attractions are lifelike recreations of gruesome murder scenes designed to frighten customers. A young man named Luca is encouraged to spend the night in the museum over a bet, but is found dead the next morning, seemingly from heart failure. Soon after Sonia arrives at the museum seeking a job, as her deceased mother had taught her how to create costumes for wax figures. She is hired by Boris, the owner and curator of the museum, despite objections from his assistant Alex. When she is leaving the museum Sonia's picture is taken by Andrea, a reporter looking into Luca's death. The two soon become lovers and Sonia finds herself becoming drawn into his investigations, especially after people start disappearing and new figures start to fill the museum halls. Inspector Lanvin, who had chosen to reconnect with Sonia while investigating some leads on her mother's death, becomes suspicious of the museum. He becomes particularly suspicious after witnessing the wax exhibit of the murder of Sonia's mother and her partner, as the exhibit contains a metal claw, a detail that was never revealed to the press or anyone outside of the investigation crew. This eventually leads to the murderer visiting Lanvin's hotel room and murdering him while wearing a mask that duplicates his face exactly. Rattled by Lanvin's death, Sonia begins to suspect that Boris is the man behind the murders and disappearances in Rome, as well as that of her mother. An attempt to learn the truth is thwarted when she discovers that he lacks a metal claw for a hand, however she is eventually kidnapped by the murderer. Her disappearance is noted by her blind aunt, who informs Andrea and the local police that the murders were done by the husband of Sonia's mother. He was a cold man who chose to focus more on his wax figures, which led to his wife taking a lover. The aunt also talks of the man's strange experiments, which resulted in him seemingly perishing in a fire. Back at the museum Sonia wakes to discover that she was kidnapped by Boris, who is indeed the murderer and had covered up his burned face and metal claw with lifelike skin made of wax. She manages to get free, but only after discovering that the wax figures in the museum are actually people that he murdered and treated with chemicals to resemble wax figures. They are kept in a state of life via chemicals Boris invented, but are unable to move. Andrea arrives to save Sonia but must battle Boris, whose wax skin progressively melts during the fight as the museum has caught on fire. Sonia and her lover manage to run from Boris, who follows them. During the chase he is attacked by Alex, who says that he will no longer be his creature. Eventually Sonia and Andrea are cornered by Boris, who has melted down to a metal skeleton, showing that almost his entire body was wax. He is then killed by Alex, who decapitates him and destroys Boris's brain. As the trio leave the burning museum, Alex leaves to enter a hidden room. There he pulls off his face, showing that he has a similar metal skeleton, and switches it out with another, implying that Boris had switched faces with Alex and that he is now free to kill again in a new location.

Argento was informed that Fulci was about to have a serious hospital operation. Argento felt that working would help Fulci recover, and decided to back him in a project of his choosing. Initial plans for a project involved doing a modern adaptation of The Mummy with Dardano Sacchetti working on a screenplay. The project later became a remake of Andre de Toth's House of Wax. Argento liked this idea, and screened copies of de Toth's film as well as Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933). Fulci and his collaborator Daniele Stroppa decided to claim that a Gaston Leroux short story entitled The Waxwork Museum was their official source of inspiration, in case they had any legal problems with Warner Bros. (which had produced House of Wax). There is, however, no such story by Leroux; an interview with film writer Alan Jones (included in the 2019 Severin Films Blu-ray) clarifies that the film was \\"inspired\\" by Leroux, but not an adaption of a specific story. Despite this fact, many sources erroneously refer to The Wax Mask as an adaptation of a Leroux story. Director Sergio Stivaletti in 1996 According to Alan Jones, Fulci and Argento argued about the direction of the film, with Fulci wanting a more atmosphere driven film while Argento wanted to increase the gore. Pre-production lasted longer than expected as Argento was working on post-production and promotion for his own film The Stendhal Syndrome (1996). Fulci died on March 13, 1997 causing Argento to turn to special effects artist Sergio Stivaletti, who he had previously worked with on films as early as Phenomena (1985). Stivaletti stated that he was shocked when Argento contacted him, finding that he \\"had been looking or a chance to direct and thought it would be with [his] own film and script [...] I was in the right place at the right time and accepted the offer.\\" Stivaletti made changes to Fulci's script, tailoring it to his interest in special effects. Variety stated the budget for the film was under $1.25 million. Release Wax Mask was released in 1997. The film had its North American premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival in Canada on July 24, 1997.  Critical reception  Variety reviewed the film favorably, terming it \\"a luridly entertaining return to the style of Britain's Hammer productions of the '60s\\" and \\"a highly enjoyable salute to cheesy vintage horror\\" but lamented the lack of \\"a guiding hand with the actors\\". AllMovie complimented Stivaletti for \\"[d]isplaying a competent handling of the material, as well as the stylistic excesses that have become synonymous with Italian horror\\" and concluded that the film \\"ultimately serves its eerily entertaining purpose.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1997 Footnotes =References= * External links * Category:1997 films Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:1997 horror films Category:Italian horror films Category:French horror films Category:Films with screenplays by Dario Argento Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Rome Category:1997 directorial debut films ","title":"The Wax Mask"},{"id":"42294089","text":"\\"Mambo\\" is a 1938 danz√≥n nuevo ritmo by Arca√±o y sus Maravillas.

In addition to running her own photography studio for over thirty years, she also spent eight years running the photography studio of Edward S. Curtis. She was a member of the Seattle Camera Club and an early mentor of Japanese-American photographers Frank Kunishige and Soichi Sunami. Personal life =Early years= Ella E. McBride was born on November 17, 1862 in Albia, Iowa to Samuel B. McBride and America McIntire McBride. In 1865, the family of five traveled via the Isthmus of Panama to Oregon. In 1882, McBride graduated high school. =Mountain climber= McBride began climbing mountains on the west coast. She began with Mount Hood and climbed more than thirty-six more major mountains over her life. She joined Mazamas, a mountaineering organization in Portland in 1896. She was the group's secretary and historian from 1896 to 1898. She met Edward S. Curtis, a photographer and Mazamas member, during a climb he led up Mount Rainier in 1897. Edgar McClure died during the descent after losing his footing; he had been gathering information to calculate Rainier's height. Curtis respected her independent mountain climbing ability and she assisted him on other climbs. The August 26, 1899 issue of Harper's Weekly reported on her trek with the Mazamas in the North Cascades up Sahale Mountain. Career =Education= In 1889, after receiving her teaching certificate, McBride taught in Portland, Oregon schools. In 1894, she became the principal of the Ainsworth School, a position she held for 13 years. =Photography= McBride moved to Seattle, Washington by 1907 to work in the Curtis Studio. She managed the office and worked in the showroom and darkroom. In 1909, she operated his booth at the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition. She opened her own studio in 1916 and the following year Edmund Schwinke joined McBride as a partner. In 1918, Wayne Albee joined the studio as chief photographer and a partner. He was assisted by Soichi Sunami and Frank Kunishige. Albee was a source of inspiration for McBride's photography, she was particularly interested in floral fine art works beginning in 1920. The studio's images were produced in local publications, including the Town Crier magazine. It photographed musicians and dancers at the Cornish School of the Arts. McBride's work was \\"firmly in the Pictorialist school\\", a \\"Modernist sharp-focus documentary style\\" that was prevalent after the 1920s, and became less popular over time. She was the only Caucasian and only woman who exhibited at the North American Times Exhibition of Pictorial Photographs in 1921. She won honorable mention for three of the floral photographs she exhibited at the Frederick & Nelson Salon. In 1922, she exhibited at a Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain competition. There were only 154 works selected out of thousands submitted. Three floral photographs of twelve accepted by American photographers were taken by McBride. McBride exhibited eight photographs in 1922 at the Frederick & Nelson Salon. It includes a portrait of Kunishige, other figure studies, landscapes and the floral still-life, Life & Death. She exhibited at F&N; in 1923 and 1925. Her interest in Japanese art is evident in her A Shirley Poppy and Dogwood works. McBride was an early member of the Seattle Camera Club, which stated that she was among the world's most exhibited photographers. He works included floral and figure studies of artists and dancers. Her works were published in the Royal Photographic Society, American Photography and other magazines in the United States and abroad. Full-page illustrations of her photographs were shown in the American Annual of Photography in 1927 and 1928. Her work was exhibited at the First International Photographic Salon of Japan in May 1927 and then solo exhibitions. In August, 30 of her prints were shown at the California Camera Club in San Francisco and in November at the Portage Camera Club in Akron, Ohio. Another solo exhibition was held in January 1931 at the Art Institute of Seattle. Her works were exhibited internationally in Paris, London, Stockholm, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Toronto, Turin, Vancouver, and Budapest. Within the United States, besides Seattle, her works were shown in New York, Chicago, Rochester, Syracuse, Cleveland, Akron, and Portland. Her exhibitions were concentrated over a 10-year period, during which she was the sixth most exhibited Pictorialist photographer in the world in 1926 to 1927. She stopped exhibiting at the beginning of the Depression. In 1925, McBride cofounded the women's Seattle Metropolitan Soropotomist Club, which she was a member and officer for almost 40 years. She focused most of her effort on her studio during the Depression. Albee had moved to California about 1930 and in 1932 she took on a new partner, commercial photographer Richard H. Anderson, who particularly took images of children. From then until the 1960s, it was one of the leading studios in Seattle. They were located in the Loveless Studio building. Her eyesight began to fail and at the age of 91, she retired. Her work is documented in the book Captive Light: The Life and Photography of Ella E. McBride by Margaret E. Bullock and David F. Martin. Death McBride died at 102 years and 10 months of age on September 14, 1965, when she was still vital and clear-minded. Some of her negatives from 1917 to the 1950s are at the Seattle's Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI); others were destroyed.

Biography Booth was born on September 8, 1843, in Longmeadow, Massachusetts to Samuel and Rhoda Colton Booth. She attended public schools and Wilbraham Academy. Her father was a scientist, and she inherited his interest for scientific studies. At her home in Springfield she had a fully equipped laboratory where she prepared and stored microscope slides. Booth travelled extensively around the United States and Canada, and was interested in photography. She prepared the micrographs used by Rupert Blue during his efforts to stop bubonic plague in San Francisco. Elected as one of the first female Fellows of the Royal Microscopical Society in 1889, Booth was also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Her other association memberships include the Royal Photographic Society, the American Microscopic Society, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. Noted for her preparation of diatoms and pollens, Booth earned a Diploma of Honor in Entomology (Women's Department) at the 1884‚Äì85 New Orleans World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition. In 1916, Booth donated a series of her photomicrographs to the Springfield Museum of Natural History. Booth died on September 15, 1922. Microscopy Whilst suffering from an illness at her home, Booth acquired skills in preparing slides for microscopy for a variety of human parasites, and was considered to have the largest private collection of them. She won a range of awards for her work, edited Practical Microscopy between 1900 and 1907, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society and Royal Photographic Society.

She was a pioneer in the academic study of small powers and middle powers and the books and articles she wrote on that subject are highly regarded in the field. She was director of the institute's Canadian Studies Program from 1977‚Äì84. Life and career Annette May Baker was born and raised in Buffalo, New York. She attended the Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls preparatory school. In 1930 she entered Wellesley College, but after two years was looking for a place with a greater research impact, and transferred to the University of Chicago, where political science was undergoing a transformation to a modern social science. She earned a B.A. there in 1934. She continued on to graduate school there, studying with leading political scientists such as Harold Lasswell and Charles Merriam. She was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1941. Meanwhile, she had met William T. R. Fox during her first year at Chicago, who was also a Ph.D. student there. They married in 1935. The couple raised two children together, both born in the 1940s. In a two-career couple, she was what later would become known as the trailing spouse. While both were still working on their dissertations, he was an instructor at Temple University from 1936‚Äì41, Entry for William T. R. Fox. while she did graduate school work at Bryn Mawr College during 1936‚Äì37, then was a research assistant at the University of Pennsylvania during 1937‚Äì38 and taught at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. At Bryn Mawr, she was appointed a reader in politics during 1940‚Äì41. He taught at Princeton University from 1941‚Äì43 and during 1942 she worked as a research assistant in the State and Local Government Section of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. He went to Yale University in 1943, where he became associate director of the Yale Institute of International Studies; she joined the Yale institute as a research assistant the same year. Under the influence of the institute's director Frederick S. Dunn, she switched her area of study from public administration to international relations. There she published her first book, Freedom and Welfare in the Caribbean: A Colonial Dilemma, in 1949. It examined the post-World War II move to independence and modernization by ex-colonial states and the resulting political and economic problems and conflicts. In 1950, her husband left Yale to go to Columbia University. In 1951, she became a part-time research associate at Princeton's new Center of International Studies, which was founded by a number of scholars who had left the Yale Institute. She remained there until 1957. She then became a lecturer in international relations at Hunter College, teaching there from 1958‚Äì61. She also taught at Sarah Lawrence College, serving as a visiting political scientist there in 1962. In 1963, she joined Columbia University's Institute of War and Peace Studies as a research associate. Her husband was the founding director of the institute, which had been created in 1951. During her time there, she also lectured at Columbia's Barnard College during the years 1966‚Äì79. In addition she became a senior lecturer at Columbia University as well. But Fox was known most for her research and writing. In 1959, she published her book The Power of Small States: Diplomacy in World War II, which examined the role that small powers play in international relations by looking at how several small European countries conducted diplomacy during the war. It was a departure from the usual focus in the field on the interactions that take place between great powers. Fox looked in detail at Turkey, Spain, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and analyzed and grouped them by the kind of security problems they faced and by the fate of their foreign policies. She developed theories as to why some such states had done better than others, such as: that geographical distance from the straight line between belligerents is helpful; and somewhat counter-intuitively, that having two great powers interested in a small state is better for it than having just one being interested. The book has been termed a \\"pioneering\\" study by several subsequent scholars as well as a \\"classic\\". In related published work, she examined the Cold War prospects of small states and the role that the United Nations could play with respect to them. Fox's work also addressed the characteristics of middle powers, and her 1977 book, The Politics of Attraction: Four Middle Powers and the United States, discussed U.S. relations with Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. In the words of a subsequent scholar, it made her a \\"pioneer\\" in the comparative study of Australia and Canada as middle powers. The book argued that the relationships between middle powers and great powers reveal more intricate behaviors and bargaining schemes than previous literature had assumed. One reviewer praised her \\"careful analysis\\" in the work. Other scholars followed up on her work while exploring the area of Canadian and Australian experiences; the book was also used as a starting point by scholars exploring American policy towards Canada. It was one of the few works outside the circle of Brazilian scholars and Latin Americanists to examine the international relations of Brazil beyond just those with the U.S. In using the comparative method to do so, she used an approach that became more popular with the growth of cross-regional analyses. In addition to her books, she published over thirty articles in scholarly journals. She also engaged in a number of joint authorships with her husband on academic work, including the 1967 book NATO and the Range of American Choice, which sought to identify desirable choices for the alliance that were politically feasible. As she later remarked drily, these efforts were \\"happily completed without the collaboration ending in divorce.\\" Despite the level of her scholarship, Fox suffered from building an academic career as a married woman with children in the 1940s and 1950s, when such a path was not at all the norm. She was never offered tenure or a tenure-track position. Indeed, Columbia's Department of Political Science would not have its first female tenured professor until the 1980s. She was, however, director of the institute's Canadian Studies Program from 1977‚Äì84. This program made use of a quarter-million-dollar grant from the William H. Donner Foundation for fellowships, expanded courses, and faculty exchanges. In addition to her own works, Fox served with Richard Howard as co-translators from the French for Raymond Aron's Peace and War: A Theory of International Relations, published in 1966. She also wrote an internal history of the institute's first thirty- five years. Anne Fox (as she was informally known) and her husband were residents of the Riverside neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut from 1950 on and she was active in the First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich. She was active in the League of Women Voters and as a Democrat in local politics, serving three terms on Greenwich's representative town meeting and serving on the town's charter revision committee while in her early nineties. She died at her home in Riverside on December 26, 2011, at age 99.

Biography After completing a PhD in applied mathematics at the University of New South Wales, Australia, in 1979, he trained in Chinese medicine, becoming a registered acupuncturist in 1983. He became clinical director of the York Clinic for Integrated Healthcare in 1986, and founded the Northern College of Acupuncture in York in 1988, acting as the college's principal from 1988 to 1997. Between 1997 and 2003, he was the research director of the Foundation for Research into Traditional Chinese Medicine, York. He then worked at the University of York, first as a senior research fellow, and in 2016 as professor of acupuncture research. He has been researching and writing about acupuncture since 1992 and published over 100 peer-reviewed articles on the subject. He has appeared on a number of radio and television programs, including BBC Radio 4's The Other Medicine, BBC Two's Alternative Medicine: The Evidence, BBC Three's Kick Ass Miracles and BBC Two's Trust Me, I'm a Doctor.  Research  Hugh MacPherson's research on acupuncture for low back pain was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), and subsequently was central to the decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to recommend acupuncture for persistent low back pain in 2009. His study of acupuncture or counselling for ongoing depression in primary care found that both acupuncture and counselling are effective for patients, the majority of whom were taking antidepressants.  Controversy  Hugh MacPherson was Principal Investigator on a study that investigated acupuncture and brain imaging in York, which was filmed by BBC Two Science but received press criticism for not being good science.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/25/science.broadcasting The BBC Trust subsequently received a complaint about the programme that questioned the ‚Äúsignificance accorded to brain-imaging results following deep needling.‚Äù The BBC defended the series against what they described as ‚Äúunjust, inaccurate and damaging allegations made in the national press‚Äù. When this complaint related to the brain imaging was considered by the BBC Trust in 2007, it was not upheld.http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/apr2007.pdf Three peer-reviewed publications (references below) resulted from this study, which established new results on acupuncture‚Äôs impact on brain function. This included a publication, published in the journal Brain Research, which showed that acupuncture works by deactivating pain pathways in the brain.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7167362/Acupuncture- lessens-pain-in-brain-not-body-scientists-discover.html  Publications  = Selected articles = * 2015. * 2013. * 2012. * 2012. * 2012. * 2011. * 2010. * 2010. * 2009. * 2008. = Edited volumes = * 2011.

Life Born at Geneva on 19 November 1830, Martin was educated at Heidelberg. He settled in England at an early age. For some years after 1856 he was secretary and amanuensis to Thomas Carlyle, whom he helped in historical researches. In 1879 Lord Beaconsfield, who found The Statesman's Year-Book useful, awarded Martin a pension of ¬£100 a year. He died on 27 January 1883 at his house in Lady Margaret Road, in north-west London, leaving a widow and family. An offside note: Frederick Martin was one of several authors for the 4 volume \\"The National History of England\\", an astounding piece of historical writing, wherein Martin expresses opinions in a grippingly realistic style, almost the like of the great Thomas Babington Macaulay in his \\"History of England\\" only a few decades earlier. Works Martin started a short-lived biographical magazine called The Statesman, in which he began an account of Carlyle's early life. Carlyle objected, so Martin closed it down. He inaugurated The Statesman's Year-Book in 1864. He continued to supervise it till December 1882, when he was compelled by ill-health to give it up, and it was taken over by John Scott Keltie. Martin's other works included: * The Life of John Clare, London, 1866. * Stories of Banks and Bankers, London, 1866. * Commercial Handbook of France, London, 1867. * The Story of Alec Drummond of the 17th Lancers, 3 vols. London, 1869. * Handbook of Contemporary Biography, London, 1870. * The History of Lloyd's and of Marine Insurance in Great Britain, London, 1876. * The Property and Revenues of the English Church Establishment,' London, 1877. Martin contributed a memoir of Thomas Chatterton, prefixed to an edition of the latter's Poems (1865); superintended a new edition of John Ramsay MacCulloch's Geographical Dictionary (1866); contributed vol. ii. of The National History of England (from 1873), and revised the fifth edition of George Henry Townsend's Manual of Dates (1877). He wrote for various newspapers, and was an occasional contributor to the Athen√¶um.

Constable. p198 History The castle in 2019 In about 1271 Alexander III of Scotland granted land to Duncan Forbes in this area and there may have been a castle up river from the present site. A second Druminnor Castle is thought to have been the original Castle Forbes. The original tower house, dated from 1456, was demolished in the early 19th century. It was described as \\"a square tower united to a half-square and which contains the staircase\\". The third castle, originally attached to the second tower, was built in 1440-70. The Gordon and Forbes families had a protracted feud, in the course of which twenty of the Gordons were murdered in the castle‚Äôs Great Hall in 1571. Later that year a party from Clan Forbes was defeated by a party of Gordons at the battle of Tillieangus, Black Arthur Forbes, their commander, being killed by William Gordon of Terpersie, and the survivors being pursued to the gates of Druminnor Castle. This dispute arose after the Master of Forbes repudiated his wife, the daughter of the Earl of Huntly. In 1590 John, Master of Forbes was accused of imprisoning his father, William, Lord Forbes, in a chamber at Druminnor and hitting him on the head with the pommel of his sword. Two younger sons, Robert Forbes Commendator of Monymusk and James Forbes of Fechell brought their father's complaint to the Privy Council, but John Forbes denied it. The Council declared that Drumminor should be kept by William Forbes of Tolquhoun and others till Lord Forbes came to Edinburgh or sent further testimony. In May 1591 John Master of Forbes claimed that his brothers had turned his father against him, and while Lord Forbes was lying sick at Dundee they had entered and robbed the House of Druminnor. The younger Forbes brothers obtained royal letters against the Master of Forbes to support their occupation of Druminnor.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 497, 617-8. Additions were made to the castle in 1841-43, under the plans of Archibald Simpson, but these were removed in a further restoration by Margaret Sempill-Forbes in the 20th century, initially with the guidance of Ian Gordon Lindsay. Structure The well during excavation in 2019 The L-plan castle has a modern door central in the north front. The basements are all vaulted. The Great Hall is on the first floor. The doorway arch, comprising five straight sections, is thought to be unique in Scotland. There is heavy corbelling carrying the circular stair tower, to the North East, squared out to create the watch-room, at the first floor. There are gun-loops which are wide-flanking. The walls are intaken at the first floor level. There are three armorial panels over the door. The south front is four stories high because of the slope in the ground. The 1815 wing which has now been demolished had pointed gables and three good dormer-heads. It is a category A listed building.

Early years Louis Gaspard Am√©d√©e baron Girod de l'Ain was born in Gex, Ain, on 18 October 1781. His father was Baron Jean-Louis Girod (1753-1839). His father had been appointed mayor of Gex in 1780 by Louis XVI of France. His mother was dame Louise-Claudine-Armande Fabry. He was the oldest of four sons. Am√©d√©e Girod de l'Ain studied law, and pleaded his first case at the age of seventeen in the Court of Cassation. He practiced as a lawyer until 1806, when he was appointed deputy imperial prosecutor in Turin. In 1807 he became imperial prosecutor in Alexandria. In 1809 he was made Attorney General to the Court of Appeal of Lyon, and in 1810 the auditor of the Council of State. He was appointed advocate-general at the imperial court of Paris in 1811, and held this position when the First French Empire collapsed in 1814. Girod de l'Ain was among those whose defection hastened the fall of Napoleon. He quickly recognized the House of Bourbon and was able to retain his office during the first Bourbon Restoration. However, when Napoleon returned during the Hundred Days of 1815, he accepted the position of President of the Court of First Instance of the Seine. He was elected on 14 May 1815 to represent the arrondissement of Gex in the Chamber of Deputies, and was a zealous supporter of the imperial cause. Around this time he married Mlle Sivard de Beaulieu, grandniece of the prince Lebrun, Duke of Plaisance. Bourbon Restoration After the second Bourbon Restoration in 1815 Am√©d√©e Girod de l'Ain was excluded from the judiciary. He temporarily returned to private life. He gave asylum in his house to General Antoine Drouot, and undertook the general's defense before the council of war. On 6 April 1816 the general was acquitted by a simple majority of four votes out of seven. Girod de l'Ain was restored to the judiciary and became a counselor at the court of Paris in 1819. In that position he was a member of a commission to prepare a proposed law for jury trials. He presided in turn over the courts of Seine and of Versailles. On 17 November 1827 Girod de l'Ain was elected Deputy for the second district of Indre-et-Loire (Chinon). He sat on the left among the constitutionalists and was active in debates. He became vice- president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1829 and supported the ministry of Jean-Baptiste de Martignac. He was reelected on 12 July 1830. July Monarchy Grandville.

La Caricature, November 1831 The rose cultivar \\"Baron Girod de l' Ain\\" Am√©d√©e Girod de l'Ain was in Paris at the time of the July Revolution, and strongly supported the assumption of power by Louis Philippe I. He was made Prefect of Police on 1 August 1830. On 21 October 1830 he was reelected as a deputy. He tried to ban meetings of the Society of Friends of the People and other political associations, but was not seen as strong enough by the government and in November 1830 was replaced as head of the police by Achille Lib√©ral Treilhard. He then joined the Council of State. He was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honor at this time. Girod de l'Ain was reelected on 5 July 1831. On 1 August 1831 he was elected president of the Chamber of Deputies with the support of Casimir Pierre P√©rier. He was Minister of Public Education and Religious Affairs from 30 April 1832 to 11 October 1832. He did little while in office, and was seen as P√©rier's passive tool. On 11 October 1832 Girod de l'Ain was made a peer of France and was appointed President of the Council of State. He held this position until his death apart from a short interruption in May 1839 when he was Minister of Justice and Guardian of the Seals in the Interim Cabinet. He was active in the upper house, and was the author of a controversial report on the attempted insurgency of April 1834. In this he attacked the popular societies, and in particular the Soci√©t√© des Droits de l'Homme, and tried to show that there had been a grand conspiracy throughout France. Am√©d√©e Girod de l'Ain died on 27 December 1847 in Paris, aged 66. The Baron Girod de l‚ÄôAin is a hybrid perpetual rose developed by Reverchon in 1897.

In an interview with CMJ published May 6, 2014, Ian Graham says they discussed the album with producers and liked the direction some were going, but when scheduling and location conflicts arose they ultimately decided to self-produce it.

It is native to Western and Central Africa from Sierra Leone in the far west to Angola in the south. It has been reported from Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Niger, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, S√£o Tom√©, Zaire, Uganda, and Angola. Description Scadoxus cinnabarinus grows from a short rhizome. Many other species of Scadoxus have a pseudostem (false stem) formed from the tightly wrapped bases of the leaves. Scadoxus cinnabarinus has at most a very short pseudostem, making the plant shorter than other species, with an overall height of up to . The flowers are borne on a scape (leafless stem) which emerges from the centre of the leaves and is usually not much taller than them, with a height of . Up to 100 (but usually fewer) orange-red flowers are arranged in an umbel at the top of the scape. The bracts underneath the umbel have withered by the time of full flowering. The individual pedicels (flower stalks) are long, and bend downwards when the fruit (a berry) is formed, whereas in most other species of Scadoxus they are upright at this stage. The flowers are somewhat differently shaped in different parts of the range of the species. In particular individual flowers from East Africa, especially Uganda, have a long tube at the base formed by the fusion of the tepals, up to long, whereas elsewhere the tube may be as short as . The width of the leaves also varies throughout the range. This variation has resulted in a substantial number of names for what appears to be a single widespread and variable species. Taxonomy Scadoxus cinnabarinus was sent to Joseph Decaisne in 1855 from Gabon, and formally named by him in 1857 as Haemanthus cinnabarinus. The specific epithet cinnabarinus refers to the colour of the flowers, which Decaisne described as \\"\\" (bright cinnabar red). Many other names within the genus Haemanthus are now considered to be synonyms of Scadoxus cinnabarinus: *Haemanthus angolensis Welw. *Haemanthus brachyandrus Baker *Haemanthus cabrae De Wild. & T.Durand *Haemanthus congolensis De Wild. *Haemanthus demeusei De Wild. *Haemanthus diadema L.Linden *Haemanthus eetveldeanus De Wild. & T.Durand *Haemanthus fascinator L.Linden *Haemanthus germarianus J.Braun & K.Schum. *Haemanthus kundianus J.Braun & K.Schum. *Haemanthus laurentii De Wild. *Haemanthus lescrauwaetii De Wild. ex Gentil *Haemanthus lindenii N.E.Br. *Haemanthus longipes Engl. *Haemanthus mirabilis L.Linden *Haemanthus radcliffei Rendle *Haemanthus rotularis Baker Scadoxus was originally separated from Haemanthus by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1838, when he moved Haemanthus multiflorus to Scadoxus multiflorus. This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when Scadoxus was again segregated from Haemanthus by Ib Friis and Inger Nordal. Haemanthus species are southern in distribution, form true bulbs and have 2n = 16 chromosomes, whereas Scadoxus species, such as S. cinnabarinus, are found throughout tropical Africa, do not all form bulbs and have 2n = 18 chromosomes. Distribution and habitat Scadoxus cinnabarinus is widely distributed around the Congo Basin from Sierra Leone in the north to Angola in the south. It is found in tropical rainforest, in humid shady habitats subject to high rainfall, where the soils are largely organic. Cultivation Scadoxus cinnabarinus has been cultivated in heated greenhouses (\\"stove-houses\\") since it was sent to Europe in 1855. Its requirement for a high temperature makes its cultivation demanding. Like other species of Scadoxus from tropical rainforests, it requires an open organic soil to ensure good drainage and aeration around the roots, together with shade from strong sun. Pests are those of Scadoxus generally. Toxicity and uses The genus Scadoxus is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous alkaloids. These are lethal to animals, such as sheep and goats, that graze on the plants. Scadoxus cinnabarinus has been used in parts of tropical Africa as a component of arrow poisons and fish poisons. It is also used in traditional medicine.

Given an element d ‚àà ‚ÑïQ0, the set of representations of Q with dim Vi = d(i) for each i has a vector space structure. It is naturally endowed with an action of the algebraic group ‚àèi‚ààQ0 GL(d(i)) by simultaneous base change. Such action induces one on the ring of functions. The ones which are invariants up to a character of the group are called semi-invariants. They form a ring whose structure reflects representation-theoretical properties of the quiver.  Definitions  Let Q = (Q0,Q1,s,t) be a quiver. Consider a dimension vector d, that is an element in ‚ÑïQ0. The set of d-dimensional representations is given by : \\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d}):=\\\\\\\\{V\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q) : V_i = \\\\mathbf{d}(i)\\\\\\\\} Once fixed bases for each vector space Vi this can be identified with the vector space : \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha\\\\in Q_1} \\\\operatorname{Hom}_k(k^{\\\\mathbf{d}(s(\\\\alpha))}, k^{\\\\mathbf{d}(t(\\\\alpha))}) Such affine variety is endowed with an action of the algebraic group GL(d) := ‚àèi‚àà Q0 GL(d(i)) by simultaneous base change on each vertex: : \\\\begin{array}{ccc} GL(\\\\mathbf{d}) \\\\times \\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d}) & \\\\longrightarrow & \\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Big((g_i), (V_i, V(\\\\alpha))\\\\Big) & \\\\longmapsto & (V_i,g_{t(\\\\alpha)}\\\\cdot V(\\\\alpha)\\\\cdot g_{s(\\\\alpha)}^{-1} ) \\\\end{array} By definition two modules M,N ‚àà Rep(Q,d) are isomorphic if and only if their GL(d)-orbits coincide. We have an induces action on the coordinate ring k[Rep(Q,d)] by defining: : \\\\begin{array}{ccc} GL(\\\\mathbf{d}) \\\\times k[\\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})] & \\\\longrightarrow & k[\\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})]\\\\\\\\\\\\ (g, f) & \\\\longmapsto & g\\\\cdot f(-):=f(g^{-1}. -) \\\\end{array} = Polynomial invariants = An element f ‚àà k[Rep(Q,d)] is called an invariant (with respect to GL(d)) if g‚ãÖf = f for any g ‚àà GL(d). The set of invariants : I(Q,\\\\mathbf{d}):=k[\\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})]^{GL(\\\\mathbf{d})} is in general a subalgebra of k[Rep(Q,d)].  Example  Consider the 1-loop quiver Q: : 1-loop quiver For d = (n) the representation space is End(kn) and the action of GL(n) is given by usual conjugation. The invariant ring is : I(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})=k[c_1,\\\\ldots,c_n] where the cis are defined, for any A ‚àà End(kn), as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial : \\\\det(A-t \\\\mathbb{I})=t^n-c_1(A)t^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+(-1)^n c_n(A) = Semi-invariants = In case Q has neither loops nor cycles the variety k[Rep(Q,d)] has a unique closed orbit corresponding to the unique d-dimensional semi-simple representation, therefore any invariant function is constant. Elements which are invariants with respect to the subgroup SL(d) := ‚àè{i ‚àà Q0} SL(d(i)) form a ring, SI(Q,d), with a richer structure called ring of semi-invariants. It decomposes as : SI(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})=\\\\bigoplus_{\\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{Q_0}} SI(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})_{\\\\sigma} where : SI(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})_{\\\\sigma}:= \\\\\\\\{f\\\\in k[\\\\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})] : g\\\\cdot f = \\\\prod_{i\\\\in Q_0}\\\\det(g_i)^{\\\\sigma_i} f, \\\\forall g\\\\in GL(\\\\mathbf{d})\\\\\\\\}. A function belonging to SI(Q,d)œÉ is called semi-invariant of weight œÉ.  Example  Consider the quiver Q: :1 \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\ \\\\ \\\\alpha\\\\ } 2 Fix d = (n,n). In this case k[Rep(Q,(n,n))] is congruent to the set of square matrices of size n: M(n). The function defined, for any B ‚àà M(n), as detu(B(Œ±)) is a semi- invariant of weight (u,‚àíu) in fact :(g_1,g_2)\\\\cdot {\\\\det}^u (B) = {\\\\det}^u(g_2^{-1}B g_1)= {\\\\det}^u(g_1) {\\\\det}^{-u}(g_2) {\\\\det}^u(B) The ring of semi-invariants equals the polynomial ring generated by det, i.e. : \\\\mathsf{SI}(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})=k[\\\\det]  Characterization of representation type through semi-invariant theory  For quivers of finite representation-type, that is to say Dynkin quivers, the vector space k[Rep(Q,d)] admits an open dense orbit. In other words, it is a prehomogenous vector space. Sato and Kimura described the ring of semi-invariants in such case. =Sato‚ÄìKimura theorem = Let Q be a Dynkin quiver, d a dimension vector. Let Œ£ be the set of weights œÉ such that there exists fœÉ ‚àà SI(Q,d)œÉ non-zero and irreducible. Then the following properties hold true. i) For every weight œÉ we have dimk SI(Q,d)œÉ ‚â§ 1. ii) All weights in Œ£ are linearly independent over ‚Ñö. iii) SI(Q,d) is the polynomial ring generated by the fœÉ's, œÉ ‚àà Œ£. Furthermore, we have an interpretation for the generators of this polynomial algebra. Let O be the open orbit, then k[Rep(Q,d)] \\\\ O = Z1 ‚à™ ... ‚à™ Zt where each Zi is closed and irreducible. We can assume that the Zis are arranged in increasing order with respect to the codimension so that the first l have codimension one and Zi is the zero-set of the irreducible polynomial f1, then SI(Q,d) = k[f1, ..., fl].  Example In the example above the action of GL(n,n) has an open orbit on M(n) consisting of invertible matrices. Then we immediately recover SI(Q,(n,n)) = k[det]. Skowronski‚ÄìWeyman provided a geometric characterization of the class of tame quivers (i.e. Dynkin and Euclidean quivers) in terms of semi-invariants. =Skowronski‚ÄìWeyman theorem= Let Q be a finite connected quiver. The following are equivalent: i) Q is either a Dynkin quiver or an Euclidean quiver. ii) For each dimension vector d, the algebra SI(Q,d) is complete intersection. iii) For each dimension vector d, the algebra SI(Q,d) is either a polynomial algebra or a hypersurface. Example Consider the Euclidean quiver Q: : 4-subspace quiver Pick the dimension vector d = (1,1,1,1,2). An element V ‚àà k[Rep(Q,d)] can be identified with a 4-ple (A1, A2, A3, A4) of matrices in M(1,2). Call Di,j the function defined on each V as det(Ai,Aj). Such functions generate the ring of semi-invariants: : SI(Q,\\\\mathbf{d})=\\\\frac{k[D_{1,2},D_{3,4},D_{1,4},D_{2,3},D_{1,3},D_{2,4}]}{D_{1,2}D_{3,4}+D_{1,4}D_{2,3}-D_{1,3}D_{2,4}}  References  Category:Directed graphs Category:Invariant theory Category:Representation theory ","title":"Semi-invariant of a quiver"},{"id":"42294501","text":"Space engine may mean: * Rocket engine, which can be used to propel spacecraft * SpaceEngine, a 3D astronomy program and game engine ","title":"Space engine"},{"id":"42294506","text":"William Lloyd Davis (born August 22, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the World Hockey Association (WHA).

Elite corruption in Uganda is through a patronage system which has been exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid has been providing the government with large amounts of resources that contribute to the corrupt practices going on within the country. The style of corruption that is used is to gain loyalty and support so that officials can remain in power. One of the more recent forms of corruption is through public procurement because of the lack of transparency with transactions that happen within the government.  Background of Corruption in Uganda  The process of giving gifts for something in exchange has always been a feature in Ugandan tradition. In the past, this practice was the norm and not seen as illegal. This practice of patronage which has been central to politics in Uganda cannot simply be stripped away over night.  Post-Independence Corruption  Corruption in Uganda is not a new thing. There is a long history of corruption in Ugandan governments- Some of the governments' level of corruption were more extreme than others. = Idi Amin Regime = Uganda under Idi Amin was a very repressive state. His military was very aggressive and would kill people if they felt like they opposed the regime in some way, which led to about 100,000 people being killed during his seven years in power. During Amins rule he took over most businesses that were run by a different race and were given to his cronies. Many businesses began to shut down because the lack of experience and knowledge the cronies had at running those businesses. All areas of society were being mismanaged and indisciplined. Soon, Uganda under the Amin regime became known for their culture of survival, which made corruption a central aspect to society. Many people left the formal economy and switched to informal institutions where there was no government regulation. = National Resistance Movement (NRM) = When the National Resistance Movement gained power in Uganda, its leader Yoweri Museveni was faced with the task of reforming the government. He also had to persuade people to rejoin in the formal economy because the black market and other forms of informal institutions were widespread during the Amin regime. Museveni said that he felt like he adopted the evils of corruption. He had implemented laws and a ten point program to help put an end to corruption in Uganda. Even though Museveni tried to reform the government, it had little impact on actually stopping corruption.  Foreign Aid  Foreign aid has contributed to corruption in Uganda through the large amounts of money and resources that are sent over. Foreign donors attempted to liberalize the Ugandan economy to try and put a stop to corruption. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund provide assistance to Uganda through Structural Adjustment Programs. These programs encouraged Uganda to decentralize and privatize. When Uganda began privatization, they were able to do so in a non-transparent way which allowed government officials to obtain these state-owned assets.  Dynamics  There are several high corruption risk areas, such as police, judiciary and procurement. Businesses are particularly vulnerable when bidding public contracts in Uganda because processes are often non-transparent, and under- the-table cash payments are demanded from procurement officers.  Anti- corruption efforts  Officials continue to engage in corrupt practices despite laws and institutional instruments that are in place to prevent and punish corruption. In an attempt to combat against corruption, Yoweri Museveni created new institutions at both the local and national level. Donors were attracted to Uganda because of their willingness to reform and stop corruption. Foreign donors began sending conditional aid to help Uganda with its reform process. The aid that Uganda received came in the form of structural adjustment programs, that were formed by the IMF and World Bank. Structural adjustment programs were in the form of conditional loans with reform policies that were meant to help Uganda transition to a more liberalized state.

It is the sixth and latest mosque built in Hong Kong. The mosque was constructed and is managed by the United Welfare Union Hong Kong Limited. History In March 2011, a Muslim group approached the government for a land to build a mosque. A piece of land was offered by the government for one year but the offer was declined, instead a site at Hoi Wan Road was identified to be more suitable. On 20 September 2012, the Lands Department approved the application and the site was handed over to the United Welfare Union Hong Kong on 1 February 2013. The construction of the mosque started in July 2013. It was completed and inaugurated on 24 November 2013.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnwiFlNCBTI The Lease expired, and the land was taken back by the government by the end of 2019. However, the government had offered an alternate site which was accepted in 2019. The construction on the new site started in July 2020. On January 1, 2020 the construction was partially completed. The previous Masjid was then demolished, and the Masjid Ibrahim officially moved to the new site in Mong Kok. As of 2020, the land is under a bridge on Ferry Street, respectively between its junction with Soy Street and Shantung Street. The management aims to complete the construction by late 2020, and expand service provision for Muslim community. Architecture The mosque has several facilities such as ablution room, pantry, classrooms, conference room and an office for Imam. These are divided into sections for men and women, to be kept separate according to religious and cultural values and norms. Transportation The mosque is accessible within walking distance from Exit C2 at Mong Kok Station of the MTR.

As a university student of Engineering at the University of Padua, Busato joined Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord and was elected municipal councillor in Casier. Having been expelled from that party, he was one of the founding members of the Padanian Independentist Movement in 1997 and was its spokesperson for two years. In this capacity, he was convicted for having been an outspoken supporter of Padania and of the Venetian Most Serene Government's seizure of St. Mark's Campanile in Venice. This last event led Busato to abandon his early Padanist feelings and to adhere to the Venetian independence movement. According to his own words, Busato returned to active politics only after the depenalisation of \\"crimes of opinion\\". In 2006 he wrote a pamphlet on independence and was a founding member of the Venetians Movementhttp://www.cavarzere.it/leggi_notizia.php?id_notizia=492 and, a year later, he launched the libertarian and avowedly separatist Venetian National Party (PNV), and served as its national secretary from 2008 to 2010. He was later active, often taking leadership roles, in a succession of separatist outfits, all emerged from bulk of the PNV: Veneto State (2010‚Äì2012), Venetian Independence (2012‚Äì2013), Plebiscite 2013 (2013‚Äì2014) and, finally, Veneto Yes (since 2013). In 2014 Busato came to regional prominence as the main organiser of Plebiscito.eu, an online referendum on Veneto's independence. According to the staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes. This was enough for Busato and his followers to proclaim Veneto's independence from Italy in Treviso on the night of 21 March. In the poll, ten \\"delegates for independence\\" were elected too: Busato was the most voted candidate with 135,306 preference votes. He has recently opened a crypto company in Slovenia, named Enkronos, launching several ICOs since 2018. They claim to have collected 12 million dollars, both from Venetian people and other speculators.

A dining room and upper bedchamber were believed to have been added by Patteson. A third wing including a lower passage and parlor below and an upper passage and bedchamber above, was added to the Northeast section early in the 19th century, and the building was significantly restyled, giving it a Federal interior.

History Peckham Platform was founded in 2009 as an initiative developed by nearby Camberwell College of Arts to commission location-specific projects by contemporary artists in collaboration with local youth groups. The first brand new, purpose-built, public-funded art gallery in South London since 1891, the building was designed by the architects Penson Group and is located on Peckham Square in the Peckham district of South London. Funders for the new venture, originally called 'Peckham Space', included Arts Council England and Southwark Council, as well as UAL. In 2013, the gallery became independent from Camberwell College of Arts, changing its name and, through the formation of a Board of Trustees, established itself as a charitable institution. Peckham Platform's founding director is Emily Druiff, whose earlier career as a curator and artist was focussed on the field of socially engaged art in London. Exhibitions Since its founding in 2009, Peckham Platform has established a programme of commissioning new work for solo exhibitions by British and international artists. These have included installation artist Gayle Chong Kwan ('Double Vision', in 2012),Gayle Chong Kwan review on www.a-n.co.uk filmmakers Sonia Boyce ('Network' in 2011) and Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen (343 Perspectives in 2012),Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen review on www.Culture24 painter Kimathi Donkor (Daddy, I want to be a black artist, in 2013),Kimathi Donkor review on http://www.fadwebsite.com performance artist Jessica Voorsanger (Peckham Heroes, in 2011)Robert Elms BBC interview with Jessica Voorsanger and Ruth Beale, whose 2014 show 'Bookbed' helped relaunch the gallery under its new name. All of the gallery's exhibitions have involved artistic collaborations with local community groups and residents, particularly young people ‚Äì in line with the institution's mission to build creative links between contemporary art and the community. Education and Youth Integral to Peckham Platform's exhibition programme is its work in public art education. As well as the educational workshops, artist's talks and seminars which are a standard element in the public gallery sector, Peckham Platform is distinctive and innovative in London because of its policy of consistently commissioning artists to make work directly in collaboration with members of the local community, particularly young people facing the challenges of inequality in one of London's most deprived urban areas. Governance Peckham Platform has charitable status under UK law and is governed by a Board of Trustees.

Its responsibilities include deciding which parties can contest elections, organising the voting and announcing the results and seats won in the various branches of the government. History Following the fall of President Suharto and the end of Indonesia's authoritarian New Order, as a result of public pressure, President Habibie brought forward the general elections planned for 2002 to 1999. On 1 February the People's Representative Council passed Law No.3/1999 on the General Election, which mandated the establishment of a \\"free and independent General Elections Commission comprising members of political parties and the government\\" to oversee the elections. The commission was then established with 53 members and former home affairs minister Rudini as chair. As a result of further public pressure, the government appointed five independent people as its representatives, including noted human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution. Other independent members included former Supreme Court judge Adi Andojo Soetjipto and political commentator Andi Mallarangeng. The 1999 elections were held on 7 June, and were a success thanks to the management of the KPU, although 27 of the 48 parties contesting the election (all but one of which won less than 0.7% of the vote) refused to sign the KPU document reporting the results. The KPU passed the problem on to President Habibie, who declared the results valid on 26 July.Puspoyo (2012) pp 282-296Abdullah (2009) p537Manning & van Dierman (2000) p18 & p35KPU website: Profile of Commission The second incarnation of the KPU was established on 11 April 2001 to organise the 2004 elections, but this time was made up of individuals from academia and NGOs. In 2007 the People's Representative Council (DPR) passed Law No. 22/2007, which stipulated that members of the KPU serve a five-year term. It also stated that members of the KPU would be chosen by a selection committee that together with the president would put forward a list of names to the DPR, which would conduct a fit and proper test. As a result of this process, which lasted from 21 to 30 August 2007, the initial 45 candidates were whittled down to 21, and a vote was taken by the DPR to decide on the final membership. The seven people chosen for the 2007‚Äì2012 term KPU were members of regional KPUs, academics, researchers and bureaucrats. Headquarters The General Elections Commission is located in a building on Jalan Imam Bonjol 29, Central Jakarta. The building, designed by architect A.W. Gmelig Meyling, was completed in 1955 and was among the first to be built in the post-war architecture style in Indonesia. It was described as \\"impressive\\" at its completion.

Stemming from Greek, the name Persephonella is based upon the mythological goddess Persephone. Marina stems from a Latin origin, meaning \\"belonging to the sea\\". It is a thermophile with an obligate chemolithoautotrophic metabolism. Growth of P. marina can occur in pairs or individually, but is rarely seen aggregating in large groups. The organism resides on sulfidic chimneys in the deep ocean and has never been documented as a pathogen.  Discovery  Persephonella marina was first isolated in 1999 using MSH medium, a medium containing 29 g NaCl, 2 g NaOH, 0.5 g KCl, 1.36 g MgCl2‚Ä¢6H2O, 7 g MgSO4‚Ä¢7H2O, 2 g Na2S2O3‚Ä¢5H2O, 0.4 g CaCl2‚Ä¢2H2O, 0.2 g NH4Cl, 0.3 g K2HPO4‚Ä¢3H2O and 10 ml of a trace-element stock solution, with a gas phase containing twenty parts carbon dioxide, one part oxygen, and twenty six parts hydrogen gas. Initial isolation was provided by a sample obtained from a depth of 2,507 meters on a sulfidic chimney. This particular sulfidic chimney was named \\"Q-Vent\\" and is located at a latitude of 9¬∞ North and a longitude of 104¬∞ West in a region called the East Pacific Rise. The environment in which P. marina was obtained was too harsh for humans due to the excessive temperature (133 ¬∞C with spikes up to 170 ¬∞C) and extreme pressure. Due to these harsh conditions a submarine was used for extraction of the samples.  Genomics  Persephonella marina has a genome size of 1.9 mega (10^9) base pairs with 2,048 encoded genes. The organism contains a GC content of 37%. This is unusually low for thermophilic organisms which typically contain high amounts of GC bonds to prevent DNA denaturation. The organism's closest phylogenetic neighbor was isolated under the same study and was named Persephonella guaymasensis. It shares 96% of its genome with P. marina. Other similar genomes include: Hydrogenothermus marinus (94.5% similarity), and Aquifex pyrophilius (85% similarity).  Characterization  = Metabolism = Persephonella marina is an obligate chemolithoautotroph. It utilizes three primary electron donors: elemental sulfur (S¬∞), hydrogen gas (H2), and thiosulfate (S2O32‚àí). Oxygen and nitrate act as electron acceptors for P. marina. In the lab, when P. marina was exposed to high amounts of elemental sulfur, the organism produced an excess of sulfide. When exposed to microaerophilic conditions as found near deep sea hydrothermal vents, P. marina was able to perform aerobic respiration. Oxygen is not the primary electron acceptor and can only be utilized when exposed to oxygen in this microaerophilic environment. = Growth Conditions = Persephonella marina is a thermophilic organism that grows optimally in a temperature range of 55 to 80 degrees Celsius. The organism does show the ability to survive at hyperthermophilic conditions as it was first isolated in water temperatures of 133 degrees Celsius. P. Marina does not have the ability to form spores, highlighting the presence of a process that keeps DNA and essential proteins stable at extremely high temperatures commonly found near hydrothermal vents. Once cultured the organism was found to be able to grow in halophilic conditions between 2 and 4 1/2 percent NaCl but grows optimally at 2 1/2 percent NaCl. P. Marina possesses a wide range of pH in which it can grow, spanning from 4.7 to 7.5. In optimal growth conditions, the doubling time for P. Marina is around 5 hours.  Glucosylglycerate and Œ±(1,6)glucosyl-Œ±-(1,2)glucosylglycerate  Persephonella marina was used as a model organism for the characterization of genes and enzymes for the synthesis of glucosylglycerate found for the first time in a thermophile. Glucosylglycerate protects the microbe from thermal stresses and helps in adaptation to starvation conditions. This is of great importance to scientists who wish to study extremophiles. This solute is also important in the advancement of biotechnology. When tested in lab, glucosylglycerate increased the melting temperature of essential enzymes in basic metabolic pathways. It has an effect on a microbe's ability to withstand high-pressure environments. This rare solute has only been found in a few other halophilic bacteria and one Archaeon, but has never been encountered in a hyperthermophile such as P. marina. It is also worth noting that P. marina has led to the discovery of Œ±(1,6)glucosyl-Œ±-(1,2)glucosylglycerate by proton NMR and is still currently under study. Both of these solutes are disaccharide heterosides which are extremely rare in thermophiles. Both are important in osmotic adaptation in microbes as well. With many questions to be answered about these two solutes, further research could benefit biotechnology in application to production of things such as food preservatives and textiles. Also, for scientists who are looking to further answer why and how hyperthermophiles survive, these two solutes could help fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle.

A film without words, the 8 minute and 49 second National Film Board of Canada short is a retelling of the sinking of the Titanic through the eyes and active imagination of a young boy. Story Over a period of three days, the film shows how the boy's fantasies of peril and adventure are frustrated by adults, who interrupt his fantasies, forcing the boy to start a new imaginary story line each time. Once aboard the ocean liner, however, the perils facing the boy are no longer the stuff of fancy. When he spots an iceberg and tries to warn the ship's captain, he is rebuffed. The film does not show the actual collision or disaster, going instead to white out. However, in an epilogue sequence, the film shows the final moments of the boy's consciousness: unable to warn anyone or make any heroic escape from this real peril, he returns to his bed, and his mind's view is extinguished. The film ends with the silent iceberg in both the left and right panels. Awards The film received the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Animated Short at the 22nd Genie Awards. International awards included a special international jury prize at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, a special award \\"for the clarity of visual narration, the fluidity of animation and the quality of soundtrack\\" at Animafest Zagreb, the prize for best short film at the Seoul International Animation Festival, the Centaur Prize in the category of best animated film at Message to Man in Saint Petersburg, a FIPRESCI Award for the \\"innovative form of storytelling, involving the audience in a little boy's inner world\\" as well as a special jury prize at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, a Silver Dragon in the animation category at the Krak√≥w Film Festival, a Silver FIPA for short film at the Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels, a Class B Award and award for best original soundtrack at the CINANIMA - Festival Internacional de Cinema de Anima√ß√£o, and a Silver Dove at the Leipzig International Film Festival.

It is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of Œ≤-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Œ≤-amyloid is a key neuropathological hallmark of AD, so markers of Œ≤-amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain are useful in distinguishing AD from other causes of dementia. The tracer successfully completed a global multicenter phase 0‚ÄìIII development program and obtained approval in Europe, US and South Korea in 2014. Alzheimer's disease and amyloid-beta PET imaging More than 44 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with some type of dementia, with two-thirds of this population likely to suffer from a mild, moderate or even severe form of AD. This number is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Accurate diagnosis and early identification of cognitive and functional impairment due to AD and other etiologies are critical for optimization of patient care and initiation of appropriate therapies. Despite the importance of early and accurate detection of dementia, in practice, many individuals are misdiagnosed or remain even undiagnosed. The deposition of Œ≤-amyloid is considered as one hallmark in the pathogenesis of AD, and most likely begins years before the onset of detectable cognitive symptoms. Clinical testing using neuropsychology or memory examinations is the standard tool to diagnose AD as clinically possible or probable. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis requires the identification of Œ≤-amyloid plaques in the brain. Until recently, this was only possible after death, in postmortem histopathology. The need of diagnosis confirmation during life has led to the development and incorporation of biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid imaging markers, as supplementary tools to facilitate clinical testing in the workflow of AD diagnosis. When used in conjunction with other clinical tests, florbetaben can assist in the diagnosis of AD by detecting the presence or absence of Œ≤-amyloid plaques. This is particularly relevant at the prodromal AD stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and at the dementia stage of this disease, where clinical tests lack accuracy to establish a trustworthy AD diagnosis.  Development program  Florbetaben binding to Œ≤-amyloid plaques on human brain samples was originally demonstrated in 2005. Highly selective binding for Œ≤-amyloid over other proteins (e.g., tau and a-synuclein) has been demonstrated in vitro. Initial single-center studies demonstrated the potential for florbetaben PET imaging to discriminate between AD patients and non-AD patients or healthy volunteers. Single dose pharmacokinetics of 300 MBq florbetaben of low or high mass dose (<=5 and 50‚Äì55 Œºg) showed no relevant differences between Japanese and Caucasian populations. When compared to healthy subjects, cortical uptake of florbetaben was demonstrated to be generally higher in a large proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment. Longitudinal data of 45 patients with MCI indicated that florbetaben PET imaging may be useful to identify patients who will progress to AD. A substantial proportion of patients with a positive florbetaben PET scan progressed to AD-dementia over a 2-year and 4-year time frame. At 4-year follow-up, 88% (21/24) of individuals with MCI and positive florbetaben uptake converted to clinical dementia due to AD, whereas none of 21 florbetaben-negative individuals with MCI experienced a conversion. The pivotal phase III study investigated the relationship of florbetaben imaging and amyloid deposition in the brain in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and other dementias and subjects without dementia. Florbetaben PET imaging showed strong tracer accumulation in the anatomically matched brain regions confirmed to have Œ≤-amyloid plaques by postmortem histopathology, thus providing direct target validation for florbetaben. Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic Œ≤-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity of the whole brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect Œ≤-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see ). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer. All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection- site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection- site irritation (1.2%). There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations. Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile. Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet. You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.

It was designed by Lars Sonck and represents National Romanticism with Art Nouveau influences. The National Romantic style manifests itself in the use of traditional Finnish materials and in the massive body of the church, as well as in nature-inspired colours and decorative motifs. The grey granite church, completed in 1912, is one of Helsinki's most readily identifiable landmarks.[1] Kallio church is a popular venue for concerts, especially organ music, thanks to its acoustics.  History  Kallio church was built between 1908 and 1912. The foundation stone was laid on July 13, 1908, and the church was inaugurated by Bishop Herman R√•bergh on September 1, 1912. In 1917, the very point at which Finland was gaining its independence, the Tolstoyan movement adopted the church as their base and preached their message of peace there. During the Second World War there was an air surveillance station in the church tower. Until the 1970s the tower served as a trig point for land surveying. The interior of Kallio Church in Helsinki.  Description  The church has a height of 65 metres, and its cross is 94 metres above sea level. The Estonian coastline can be seen from the tower. The church is on a hill, and it forms the northern end point of a 2.5 km long street axis made up of three streets, Kopernikuksenkatu, Siltasaarenkatu, and Unioninkatu. Kallio church is a hall church with a transept. The load-bearing walls are built of red bricks and clad in Finnish granite. There is seating for 1.100 worshippers. The interior of the church is decorated with Christian symbols such as roses, lilies, palm branches, laurel crowns and pearls to pass on the message of the Gospels. There are also Art Nouveau murals inside the church. The altarpiece is a wooden relief ‚ÄòTulkaa minun tyk√∂ni‚Äô (‚ÄòCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened‚Äô) by Hannes Autere, carved in 1956. In the vestibule of the church and in the organ galleries there are four plaster reliefs from Sigrid af Forselles‚Äô five-part series Ihmissielun kehitys (‚ÄòDevelopment of the human soul‚Äô). In the sacristy there's a painting by Verner Thom√©, depicting Jesus healing a blind man. Paavo Tynell designed the massive brass lamps in 1932. The church textiles currently in use are designed by Raija Rastas. There are seven German bronze bells in the granite tower of the church. Each day at noon and at 6 pm, the chorale (op.65b) by Jean Sibelius, composed expressly for Kallio church, is played on four of the bells. The three largest bells ring to announce church services.  Pipe organs  Kallio church is the only church in Finland to have both a Baroque organ and a French organ from the Romantic period. The French organ by the Swedish organ maker √Ökerman & Lund was made in 1995, and it serves as the main organ of the church. The smaller Baroque organ was built in Kangasala, Finland in 1987. 362x362px  Columbarium  A columbarium under the church was completed in 1991. There is room for around 2500 urns at a time, and the urns can be kept in the columbarium for a fixed period. After that, they can be concealed in a sepulchre, also situated under the church. The columbarium can only be visited when an urn is taken there. Visitors can bring flowers or light candles by the memorial for the departed, which can be found on the back wall of the church, beside the main entrance.

The square is a four-sided space near the junction of six roadways in the center of Bristol, just north of the Newfound River and west of the Pemigewasset River. The district includes all of the buildings that are arrayed around the square, as well as one contemporary commercial building located just south of the Newfound River on South Main Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The center of Bristol began to take shape in the 1760s with the arrival of the first non-Native settlers. A road was cut along the Pemigewasset River, which crossed the Newfound River near where South Main Street does today. A mill was built a little way to the east. By the 1790s a small town center had emerged, including two tavern buildings that still stand. A new road (now North Main Street) to Newfound Lake in 1805 further enhanced the area's importance as a transportation junction, shortly followed by what is now Pleasant Street in 1808. How the square itself formed is uncertain, since there are no formal town documents discussing the matter. The center grew in the 19th century with the arrival of industrial mills and the railroad. Most of the municipal functions were located away from the square, which developed as a commercial business district.

Its construction began in August 1942, it received its first prisoners in June 1943, and it shut down in September 1945. It was the largest World War II POW camp in the Southeastern United States, holding between 2,000 and 12,000 German prisoners at any one time. History Advertisement which ran on March 20, 1947 in the Tuscaloosa News, placed by the War Assets Administration soliciting bids on the dismantled parts of Camp Aliceville The construction of Camp Aliceville began in August 1942 and was completed by December. The camp began receiving German POWs, at first mostly from Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps, in June 1943. It comprised 400 wood-frame barracks, which could hold as many as 6,000 prisoners and 900 Army personnel. Aliceville was the largest of the eleven POW camps in the Southeastern U.S. By the end of the war Camp Aliceville held German prisoners captured in many different locations. It closed on September 30, 1945. The camp was dismantled and sold for scrap after the war, and its only remaining trace is an old stone chimney. Camp life Prisoners at Camp Aliceville created a rich cultural life in the camp, which included musical groups, theatre productions, and a camp newspaper called Der Zaungast, one of 80 local POW camp newspapers. Aliceville camp authorities held landscaping contests, to which the prisoners responded enthusiastically, creating spectacular topiary and intricately designed flower gardens. College level classes, English being the most popular, were taught to prisoners by faculty from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Prisoners could arrange for transcripts of courses they'd taken to be sent to the Reich Ministry of Education in Germany, which would award them academic credit for their work. According to Randy Wall, \\"fewer than 10 percent of all German POWs were devoted Nazis.\\" In many American POW camps, including Aliceville, these prisoners harassed, injured, or killed prisoners who they thought had become too comfortable with their American captors. Camp Aliceville doctor Stephen Fleck said that \\"Most of [the murders] were accomplished with bare hands or some cooking utensil...they cold-bloodedly killed either with knives or strangling during the night. We probably had two or three such deaths a month...anybody whom they suspected of wavering in his Nazi enthusiasm. Nobody would squeal, because the squealer would likely meet a similar fate.\\" To protect prisoners from such violence, American military authorities established a number of so-called \\"segregation camps,\\" to which \\"ardent Nazis\\" could be sent. Although it began as an ordinary POW camp, by 1944 Aliceville had become a segregation camp itself. There were over 2000 escape attempts made by German POWs held in American camps during the war, and Aliceville was no exception. One group of six prisoners at Aliceville made it as far as Memphis, Tennessee, where they were captured by the FBI after stealing a car. Prisoners at Camp Aliceville were treated humanely, partly because the United States government hoped that the German government would reciprocate in its treatment of American prisoners of war. The fact that American neighbors of the camp were experiencing shortages of goods and mandatory rationing of many necessities led to some hard feelings against the prisoners. Present The Aliceville POW Museum, which hosts \\"what is said to be the largest collection of World War II POW memorabilia in the United States,\\" houses papers, letters, documents, maps, and other material from Camp Aliceville and other POW camps. The museum hosted reunions of prisoners and guards in 1989, 1995, and 2007.

History The Board was first organized in 1946 as the Building Research Advisory Board. This source cites the NAS Annual report for 1950. BICE and its predecessor organizations have been the principal units of the NRC concerned with the built environment. Programs Although most of the BICE activities are advisory services, a number of specific programs have been created and maintained over the years, one of which was the Federal Construction Council and its successor, the Federal Facilities Council. Federal Construction Council (FCC) The Federal Construction Council was founded in 1953 at the request of the National Bureau of Standards as part of the NRC's division of Engineering and Industrial Research and its subdivision, the Building Research Advisory Board (BARB, later the BICE). It operated through the late 1990s, often supported by arrangements with the National Bureau of Standards, or the Department of Commerce. Its main purpose was to encourage continuing cooperation among those agencies with a direct or indirect interest in federal construction to advance the practice of design, construction, and operation of government facilities. It sought to minimize duplication of effort on technical studies as well as disseminate what are now termed best practices. It also sought to resolve technical problems of particular concern to the federal construction agencies. Preface, Forward. Its membership comprised 19 members appointed by the BRAB chairman, with the approval of the Chairmen of the National Research Council; ten of its members were from the BARB and nine from nominations made by the Federal agencies providing financial support. =Early work= Practice surveys In both 1954 and 1958, the FCC surveyed engineering practices in Building Technology by the thirty-six Federal agencies that had a direct or indirect interest in building or heavy construction, consisting of over 300 projects. The FCC would continue this survey practice to the late 1960s, producing updates in 1961 (SP3), 1963 (SP5), 1965 (SP6), 1968 (SP8). Underground heat-distribution systems An example of the work performed by this committee is its study of underground piping systems which at that time (1957-1964) was a ...\\"major and continuing concern to the Federal Construction Council.\\" As result of its efforts, technical reports were published and sound design criteria were developed. =1970-1980= The Federal Construction Council's technical program for the 1970s included three broad categories of activities: continuing programs, ad hoc studies, and other activities. The council carried on 8 continuing programs: the Federal Construction Guide Specifications program (ended 1978), the Cost Engineering proqram, the Computer Technology proqram, the Design Criteria proqram, the Information Exchange program, the Fire Technology program, the Facilities Safety program, and the Procurement policy program. The FCC conducted many \\"ad hoc\\" studies over the years to address \\"...specific problems or issues of mutual concern to federal construction agencies ... [dealing with] ... with both technical and administrative problems. Federal Facilities Council (FFC) The Federal Facilities Council is a successor to the Federal Construction Council. It is a cooperative association of 20 federal agencies with interests and responsibilities related to all aspects of facility design, acquisition, management, maintenance, and evaluation. Project management at the Department of Energy (DOE) The 105th Congressional Committee of Conference on Energy and Water Development in its appropriation conference report directed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to undertake an independent review and assessment of its project management structure and processes for identifying, managing, designing and constructing facilities. In TITLE III, Department of Energy where additional items of conference agreements were discussed. The concern was the quality of the technical scopes, cost estimates, schedules, and supporting data regarding these construction projects as well as the validity of the proposed costs, scopes, and schedules. The study was to also include a review of large operating projects such as environmental projects which may or may not involve much construction, but should clearly be managed with the same principles and guidelines. The overall objective was achieve departmental processes that controlled the projects' cost and schedule as well as reduce cost growth and schedule slippages. While the original congressional direction was for the US Army Corps of Engineers to perform the review, the final version allowed the DOE to ask the National Research Council (NRC) to conduct such a study. In 1998, prior to delivering the later general study in 1999, NRC completed a short time frame study using a generic approach to assess DOE's FY98 budget request, which did not attempt to address the broader issues of systems acquisition and project delivery within DOE raised by the conference report. In its 2003 assessment report, NRC recommended that DOE ...\\"develop detailed procedures and guidance for identifying risks, planning strategies to address risks, and managing risks throughout the life cycle of projects, and should require their implementation for all projects.\\" The DOE Office of Engineering and Construction Management (OECM) requested the committee to provide assistance for following this recommendation by summarizing practices the committee believes constitute excellence in risk management. Over the next seven years, NRC delivered four more reports on its assessments of DOE project management.

The district covers , and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Colburn Park is located a short way south and east of the Mascoma River, whose generally east-west route is interrupted by a semicircular bend to the north, within which lies the center of Lebanon. The park's origin is in 1792, when the land was donated by Robert Colburn as the site of the community's meeting house (church and town hall). Arterial roads were built to the area, and it began to develop as a commercial and civic center in the early 19th century. The Greek Revival First Congregational Church, designed by Ammi Burnham Young, was built in 1828, and a few early houses survive. The meeting house was moved in 1849 to the present location of City Hall. Lebanon's central business district was struck by devastating fire in 1887, in which more than 80 buildings were destroyed. This did not directly affect the area around the park, but Lebanon's population continued to grow, and the business district expanded, resulting in the relocation of houses around the park, and the construction of a number of Victorian buildings around its perimeter. After the 1923 destruction by fire of the town hall, the area acquired a somewhat unified late-19th to early-20th century commercial and civic architecture.

She was named for Hull, Quebec, but due to possible confusion with , her name was altered. La Hulloise was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 10 August 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 29 October 1943. She was commissioned 20 May 1944 at Montreal with the pennant K 668. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda, La Hulloise was assigned to convoy escort group EG 16 out of Halifax.

The oldest of the three buildings is the schoolhouse, which dates to 1808 and is now a local museum. The Dorchester Community Church was built in 1828, and the (now former) town hall in 1844, on the site of the town's first (1828) town hall. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; the church was also separately listed in 1980. Church The Dorchester Community Church is a single-story frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a square tower topped by a hexagonal cupola. The building was built in 1828, in the Thompson Hill area of southern Dorchester. Seeing declining participation, in 1883 it was disassembled and rebuilt at this location, with a slightly reduced size. In the 1940s, a local family donated funds for the building to be electrified. Town hall The former town hall is a single-story frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. The front-facing gable is fully pedimented, with a half-oval fan at the center. The main entrance is at the center, with a double-leaf doorway topped by another half-oval fan and flanked by pilasters. The bays on either side of the door have sash windows. Additions are attached to the left and rear of the building. The interior was originally fitted with a pulpit, which was removed when the local Grange chapter installed a stage in its place in the early 20th century. School The schoolhouse is a small single-story frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is capped by a small square belfry.

It is a locally listed building. History Local civic officials found it necessary to establish some proper accommodation following the formation of the Waltham Holy Cross Urban District in 1894. The site selected was occupied by an old slum called Camps Court which was accordingly demolished. The foundation stone for the \\"Waltham Holy Cross Council Buildings\\" was laid by Mrs A. J. Chapman, wife of the then chairman of the council, in January 1904. The building, which was designed in the Art Nouveau style with a tower in the style of a french chateau, was built by the local contractor, John Bentley & Sons. It was officially opened by Mrs A. J. Chapman in late 1904. There were originally two arched doorways to the west of the front door for use by a horse-drawn fire engine. The fire engine was mechanised in 1923 and the fire station moved to Romeland after the Second World War. In late 1914, during the First World War, the building was converted for use as an auxiliary hospital. The hospital, which was managed by a Voluntary Aid Detachment i.e. a voluntary unit of civilians providing nursing care for military personnel, initially deployed 40 beds but later in the war this increased to 50 beds, and after a hutted ward had been built it increased to 64 beds. The building continued to be the meeting place of Waltham Holy Cross Urban District Council but ceased to be the local seat of government when Epping Forest District was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. In 2003 a plaque was erected on the town hall by the Richard III Society to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the death of Margaret of York, who had local connections and had been sister of both King Edward IV and King Richard III. The local singer, Luciee-Marie Closier, who performed in series 3 of the talent show, The Voice, performed from the balcony of the town hall in November 2014.

Aleksa became Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Communications. The party pulled out of the coalition around May 1927, but Aleksa disobeyed and remained minister until 1935. The party was banned later in 1928. Ideology The party held had secular and liberal platform, and unlike other agrarian parties, advocated religious tolerance. It sought to support the interests of agriculture and industry, as well as measures to develop Lithuanian culture. The party envisioned itself as a mediator between the political right and left.

It was founded in 2002, and is located on Fleminggatan in Stockholm. TLV's remit is to determine which pharmaceutical products, care- related medical devices and dental care procedures shall be subsidized by the state. It also determine retail margins for all pharmacies in Sweden, regulate the substitution of medicines at the pharmacies and supervise certain areas of the pharmaceutical market. The fact that a central government agency has the decision on which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are to be subsidized is partly the result of a goal to make pharmaceutical benefits equal across Sweden. It is the Government that decides, via the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, which activities TLV shall undertake.  Decisions on pharmaceutical subsidies  Pharmaceutical companies submit applications for their products to be subsidized and covered by the high-cost threshold, which TLV then makes a decision on. TLV also reviews the pharmaceuticals already covered by the high-cost threshold to see whether or not they should remain so. TLV bases its decisions on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act and takes into account three fundamental principles: * the human value principle - the health care system should respect the equal value of all human life * the need and solidarity principle - those with the most pressing medical needs should have more of the health care system's resources than other patient groups * the cost-effectiveness principle - the cost of using a medicinal product should be reasonable from a medical, humanitarian and socioeconomic perspective  Reference prices and high-cost threshold for dental care  TLV decides on the high-cost threshold for dental care and is responsible for determining which rules apply to dental care benefits. This involves deciding on what is to be subsidized and the reference prices that will apply to various dental treatments. The reference prices are used to calculate the subsidy the patient will receive for various treatments.  Regulation of the pharmacy market  TLV is responsible for the regulations concerning how pharmacies exchange more expensive medicines for ones with the same active ingredients but a lower price; the generic exchange. The exchange results in price competition on pharmaceuticals, which frees up several billions of kronor every year. TLV also determines the level of compensation that pharmacies receive for handling prescription products; the pharmacies' trade margin.  Acts and ordinances that govern TLV's activities  In the matter of whether a medicine or medical device is to be covered by the high-cost threshold, TLV bases its decision on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act. For dental treatment, TLV works from the National Dental Care Subsidy Act. TLV's own regulations TLVFS are a supplement to the acts and ordinances that govern its activities.  Collaboration with other actors  TLV collaborates with expert parties in the fields of medicine, dentistry and finance, as well as with county councils and other authorities active in the sector.

He was tipped as a potential successor to the retiring John Landy as Australia's leading miler; however, newcomer Herb Elliott defeated him at the 1957 national championships. Lincoln ran his first four-minute mile on 23 March 1957, the eleventh man in the world and the third Australian to accomplish that feat. His time of 3:58.9 was less than a second short of Landy's world record of 3:58.0.

Track & Field News ranked him #7 in the world for 1957, one place below his Australian rival Elliott. Lincoln reached his peak in 1958 but was overshadowed by the rapidly improving Elliott. The Australian team of Elliott, Lincoln, and Albie Thomas swept the medals in the mile at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Lincoln running 4:01.80 for silver. He set his personal mile best of 3:55.9 in Dublin on 6 August 1958, finishing more than a second under Derek Ibbotson's world record of 3:57.2 yet still only being the runner-up as Elliott won in a new record time of 3:54.5.

The market transaction transforms the womb from a human body part, to being a service provided for purchase on the market. The womb in its commodified state has both exchange value and use value. Market transactions involving the services of women's wombs became increasingly common in the early twenty-first century. Such transactions are generally relied upon by those unable to conceive and those who are willing to pay someone else to bear pregnancy. Commodification of the womb raises several ethical and legal questions, which have expanded from questions regarding the rights of surrogates and biological parents, and the legitimacy of a child resulting from the transaction, to questions regarding transnational surrogacy within a global market. History =Background= Through modernization of reproductive technology, the options for having a child has expanded to include artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and surrogacy as possible solutions when faced with infertility. A woman may essentially offer to rent her womb for the gestation of a child who will be given to another person following the birth of the child. Surrogacy has been a practice throughout history yet has become more popular in the modern day. In the Bible, Rachel who was infertile, gives her handmaid Bilhah to her husband Jacob to bear him children. The two children, Dan and Naphtali whom Bilhah gave birth to were given names by Rachel who was considered their mother following birth. This was the earliest biblical example of surrogacy. Twine, France Winddance. \\"Outsourcing the Womb: Race, Class and Gestational Surrogacy in a Global Market\\", Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, 2016, pp. 6‚Äì15 From the Middle Ages to modern times, other reproductive services have also been supplied for a fee. For example, in the Middle Ages a wet nurse would feed and care for another woman's child, in exchange for payment. These reproductive services often share a common thread of a woman of lesser economic means supplying either gestation or care of another woman's child for an individual fee or as part of her employment =New reproductive technologies= In the late twentieth and early twenty- first centuries, artificial insemination made impregnation possible without sexual intercourse. Thus the market for commodification of the womb was transformed. Through the advancements of modern technology, potential parent(s) have the ability to enter into a market transaction with a woman, in which the woman agrees to gestate a child, either of her own egg or that of a surrogate, with the contractual obligation of turning this child over upon birth. Having a child born of a commercial surrogate could be considered a luxury good. Luxury goods are typically only available to those with significant means, beyond that of necessities. It could be considered that, just as in the Biblical cases of handmaids being asked to conceive children, early twenty-first century women offering their womb to the market would also be of lesser economic means. =Early markets= Viewing the womb as a commodified good allows for the understanding of the market supply, demand, and transactions that take place with a part of the human body. The market for commercial surrogacy began to take shape in the late 1970s; one of the more prominent figures in this market was attorney Noel Keane of Michigan, United States. Spar, Debora. ‚ÄúFor love and money: the political economy of commercial surrogacy,‚Äù Review of International Political Economy 12 (2005): 287-309. Keane and other entrepreneurs saw a market for the womb, and hence the commodification of the womb began. Keane started brokering deals, for a fee, between potential surrogates and parents until he found out that it was illegal for a genetic parent to sell their child to another person in the state of Michigan. Keane's business model was to have fathers contribute sperm and the surrogate mothers provided eggs. The surrogate mothers were genetically related to the child, while the non-birth mothers were not. Such surrogacy arrangements were illegal in some states on the basis that the non- birth mothers were paying the biological mothers for their genetically related children. The state of Michigan was one such state that enacted laws forbidding these surrogacy arrangements, thereby making Keane's business model illegal. Keane, Noel P. ‚ÄúLegal Problems of Surrogate Motherhood,‚Äù Southern Illinois University of Law Journal 5 (1980): 147-169. The main purpose of these laws was to prevent the sale of infants as if they were property. Some states viewed surrogate contracts as void, the payment for a child was illegal, and/or viewed artificial insemination as adultery, if the couple was not married. To avoid the legal issues Keane thought women would volunteer, without pay, to become surrogates out of an altruistic motivation. However, without the promise of financial compensation, Keane found a sharp decline in the number of women who volunteered. In the early 1980s Keane moved his commercial surrogacy business to Florida, where laws were more lenient. Florida also had no laws regarding the exchange of money for infants.Merino, Faith. ‚ÄúAdoption and Surrogate Pregnancy.‚Äù June 2010. New York, Facts on File: 36. A commercial surrogacy broker could be viewed as a capitalist organizing production and offering a product to the market. This raised the question of whether women and children are being viewed not as human beings but as commodities of the market, being bought and sold for the highest prices. At the outset of commercial surrogacy, the laws in place in the United States were not equipped to handle the resulting legal and ethical questions that would arise. As with many modern markets, womb commodification has moved from local markets to outsourcing in foreign countries. Conceptualization Commodification refers to the process by which goods and services are transformed into commodities to be bought and sold in the market. In Capital, from the Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secrets, Karl Marx describes a commodity as a thing. Marx calls commodities trivial, strange, and use values to satisfy human needs.Karl Marx. ‚ÄúThe Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret,‚Äù Capital Volume I. (London: Penguin Books, 1990) 163. Marx conceptualizes the commodity as something man transforms from raw materials into a final good. Marx is describing things which are not human, and thus the commodity of the womb cannot be independent of the woman. The womb gains value in the market through exchange value and use value. Women's overall market participation is growing both as consumers and as producers. The womb, a product owned only by women, being sold to other women creates a market where women are predominantly the consumer as well as the sole owners of the product. It is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the product of the womb from the human being. Outside of the human, the womb has little value, but once its functions can be traded for profit on the market it is of interest to everyone.  Ethics  Womb commodification raises ethical questions regarding exploitation of poor/low income women, the rights of the child and the natural biological function of the human body. ‚ÄúSurrogacy.‚Äù The Center for Bioethics and Culture, www.cbc-network.org/issues/making- life/surrogacy/. The commodification of the bomb also tries to balance against a woman's right to enter in to a contract and to make decisions regarding her own body. Womb commodification could be viewed as economic agents engaged in free market trade. The commodification argument asks whether women are being given control over their body, or whether they are being exploited for their individual body parts with monetary incentives. An ethical argument against womb commodification is that it allows the rich to take advantage of the willingness of poor women to perform any job as long as they are able to earn a wage. A woman may choose to commodify her womb for money because she is faced with no other profitable options for employment, however the payment arrangement and monetary value varies from case to case. Since the surrogate functions as a gestational carrier, only carrying the pregnancy to delivery; the surrogate has no legal claim or responsibility to the child after pregnancy. This causes an ethical issues regarding the rights of the child. There is no claim to the gestational carrier after birth which usually means the child cannot obtain any information about the carrier or possible siblings.‚ÄúSurrogacy.‚Äù The Center for Bioethics and Culture, www.cbc- network.org/issues/making-life/surrogacy/ Women in the modernized world often choose to defy nature and carry children with no biological relationship to them. This transforms the nature of a woman's bodies function into a commercial transaction. Legal Issues Reproductive technology is a relatively recent phenomenon with little universal regulation. Patton, Brock A. \\"Buying a Newborn: Globalization and the Lack of Federal Regulation of Commercial Surrogacy Contracts.\\" UKKC Law Review volume 79: (2010-2011) p 507-534. Surrogates, clinics, and commissioning couples often choose the market that is most favorable, beneficial, or profitable to them. Many individual states in the United States view the gestational mother as the legal mother, which can prove problematic when determining rights of the surrogate versus the rights of the commissioning couple. Ramskold, Louise Anna Helena, and Marcus Paul Posner. ‚ÄúCommercial surrogacy: how provisions of monetary remuneration and powers of international law can prevent exploitation of gestational surrogates.‚Äù Journal of Medical Ethics (2013): 397-402. Opposition and challenges to surrogacy agreements most often relate to the nature of the surrogacy contract. Anderson, Kelly A. \\"Certainty in an Uncertain World: The Ethics of Drafting Surrogacy Contracts.\\" Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, volume 21 (2008). p 615-630. One of the legally debated questions is whether the contract is granting a woman the right to sell the service of her labor through womb rental or whether the surrogate and the commissioning parents are entering into an agreement to sell/purchase a child. One of the most controversial legal issues is determining the rights of surrogate as the birth mother versus contractual obligations of the surrogate as a party to a contract. A mother is commonly defined as a woman who has given birth or legally adopted a child.Larkey, Amy M. ‚ÄúRedefining Motherhood: Determining Legal Maternity in Gestational Surrogacy Arrangements.‚Äù Drake Law Review (2003). The law often does not keep pace with technology. With the advancements of surrogacy and the invention of commercial surrogacy, what it means to be a mother will inevitability need to be redefined. A question at the forefront of legal debates is whether the birth mother may be required to relinquish her rights to the child, or whether the biological parents‚Äô rights supersede the rights of the birth mother. In order to avoid the sale of a human, which is illegal, the focus of a surrogacy contract needs to focus on the legal use of the surrogate's womb to be enforceable. There is little case law on which to rely and this legal battle is made more complex when the element of transnational surrogacy is added. Birth often confers nationally and citizenship. With transnational surrogacy being a common form of commercial surrogacy, there is growing demand for international regulation of this burgeoning market. =Surrogacy laws by country= There are two types of surrogacy: commercial surrogacy and altruistic surrogacy. Commercial surrogacy is when the surrogate offers the rental of her womb to the market for financial gain. Conversely, the surrogate generally does not profit from the rental of her womb in altruistic surrogacy. The following countries legally permit both commercial surrogacy and altruistic surrogacy: Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Cyprus, India, South Africa, and the United States (in the states of Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, and Vermont). Other countries permit altruistic surrogacy: Australia, Canada (except Quebec), the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Israel, and United States (in the states of New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nebraska, Virginia, Oregon, and Washington). There are also countries in which any form of surrogacy is illegal, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Moldova, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Japan, and the United States (in the states of Arizona, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota). ‚ÄúSurrogacy laws by country.‚Äù Surrogate Baby.

Legalization was pushed forward with the hope that medical tourism, and specifically reproductive tourism in India would increase. Economic and social impacts With a lack of regulation in the commercial surrogacy market, payments to surrogates can vary depending on the terms of the individual contract. Deomampo, Daisy. ‚ÄúTransnational Surrogacy in India: Interrogating Power and Women's Agency.‚Äù Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Volume 34, Number 3 (2013): 167-188. India is a favored location for commercial surrogacy due to the lower costs. By some estimates, those wishing to enter in to a commercial surrogacy contract could save as much as $70,000 in India versus the United States.Jaishankar, K., and Natti Ronel, editors. ‚ÄúSecond International Conference of the South Asian Society of Criminology and Victimology.‚Äù (2013): 167-169. =Social benefits= By becoming commercial surrogates women in India are enabling themselves to improve not only their lives but also the lives of their families. It is common for surrogates to have had limited access to education, which could limit the opportunities for employment in the market. Payment for surrogacy varies by contract, estimates range from the equivalent of three times what the head of household could make in a month, to earning in nine months an amount that would take fifteen years worth of work. This amount of money can provide access to better housing, food, education, and sanitation, that would otherwise not be probable. Former surrogates also have the ability to become agents for surrogacy clinics. Agents, for a fee, facilitate a surrogate's doctor's visits and look out for the care and wellbeing of the surrogate throughout the course of her pregnancy. Becoming an agent allows the woman to have several patients and she is able to collect fees from each of them, which may further improve her financial situation. It was expected that profits for commercial surrogacy would reach as high as six billion dollars by 2012. 6 September 2018, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is declared unconstitutional in India. After this path breaking decision, surrogacy, especially single father surrogacy will see a boost among LGBT community. =Clinics= When a woman signs a contract to become a gestational carrier she is subject to hormone administration and embryo transplantation to become impregnated. Many, but not all surrogates move to gestational hostels and receive better medical treatment and care than they would receive were they giving birth to their own child free of the obligation of a contract. Vora, Kalindi. ‚ÄúLimits of ‚ÄúLabor‚Äù: Accounting for Affect and the Biological in Transnational Surrogacy and Service Work.‚Äù South Atlantic Quarterly, Winter 2014. Nutrition, health, and rest are all monitored as part of the contract, with the wellbeing of the fetus often paramount to that of the surrogate. Many clinics that broker transnational surrogacy prefer women who have already given birth, as the clinics have evidence of a viable uterus. The clinics may also prefer women who have their own children, with the hope that the surrogate will not bond with the fetus. Surrogacy contracts focus on the rental of an unused womb, with the belief that the fetus is the property of another. Many surrogates only receive full payment for their service if the full duration of the pregnancy is met. The appeal for foreign parents of transnational surrogacy is due to the lower costs and wage demands than they would find in their home country. Dr. Nayna Patel runs the Akanksha clinic, in Anand, India. At first most of the clients seeking fertility services from the Akanksha clinic were Indian, but their clientele has expanded to Westerners also seeking a child. Many come to this distant clinic as the fees are too high in their own country - foreign couples are seeking lower priced alternatives to local surrogacy, and foreign surrogates may be willing to accept a lower fee. Surrogates at the Akanksha clinic have the possibility of making $5500 for this transaction, a sum of money that is significant in providing for a family, education, housing, and wellbeing when compared to other alternatives.

Surrogacy challenges the traditional view of citizenship, by redefining what it means to be a mother. Nations must now consider if a mother is the person who physically gave birth to the child, the one who provided her ovum, or the one who will care for the child. In July 2010, consuls general from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the Czech Republic sent letters to surrogacy clinics in Mumbai, India, to direct potential clients from these countries to seek guidance from their consulates before entering into surrogacy contracts. These countries have varying surrogacy laws, and many of their citizens have faced difficulties upon trying to gain citizenship rights for children born in India. =Manji= One of the most well known cases of problematic transnational surrogacy and lineage is that of the baby girl known as Manji, born in 2008, in India. Manji's birth was the result of a commercial surrogacy contract between her Japanese parents and her Indian surrogate. Before Manji's birth, her parents divorced, and her commissioning mother refused to claim her. Under Indian law, an infant's passport may only be issued in conjunction with the mother's. Since neither her Japanese or Indian mother would claim Manji, for a brief time she was not considered a citizen of Japan, India, or any other country. Parks, Jennifer A. ‚ÄúCare ethics and the global practice of commercial surrogacy.‚Äù Bioethics, Volume 24, Issue 7 (September 2010): 333-340. It was not until her paternal grandmother claimed her, accompanied by a lengthy legal battle, that Manji was able to apply for a passport and citizenship.

In the 17th century the practice of mixing opium with tobacco for smoking spread from Southeast Asia, creating a far greater demand. 350px Imports of opium into China stood at 200 chests annually in 1729, when the first anti-opium edict was promulgated. By the time Chinese authorities reissued the prohibition in starker terms in 1799, the figure had leaped; 4,500 chests were imported in the year 1800. The decade of the 1830s witnessed a rapid rise in opium trade, and by 1838, just before the First Opium War, it had climbed to 40,000 chests. The rise continued on after the Treaty of Nanking (1842) that concluded the war. By 1858 annual imports had risen to 70,000 chests (), approximately equivalent to global production of opium for the decade surrounding the year 2000. By the late 19th century Chinese domestic opium production challenged and then surpassed imports. The 20th century opened with effective campaigns to suppress domestic farming, and in 1907 the British government signed a treaty to eliminate imports. The fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, however, led to a resurgence in domestic production. The Nationalist Government, provincial governments, the revolutionary bases of the Communist Party of China, and the British colonial government of Hong Kong all depended on opium taxes as major sources of revenue, as did the Japanese occupation governments during the Second Sino- Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). After 1949, both the respective governments of the People's Republic of China on the mainland and of the Republic of China on Taiwan claimed to have successfully suppressed the widespread growth and use of opium. In fact, opium products were still in production in Xinjiang and Northeast China.  Early history  Historical accounts suggest that opium first arrived in China during the Tang dynasty (618907) as part of the merchandise of Arab traders. Later on, Song Dynasty (9601279) poet and pharmacologist Su Dongpo recorded the use of opium as a medicinal herb: \\"Daoists often persuade you to drink the jisu water, but even a child can prepare the yingsu soup.\\" Initially used by medical practitioners to control bodily fluid and preserve qi or vital force, during the Ming dynasty (13681644), the drug also functioned as an aphrodisiac or chunyao () as Xu Boling records in his mid-fifteenth century Yingjing Juan: > It is mainly used to treat masculinity, strengthen sperm, and regain vigour. > It enhances the art of alchemists, sex and court ladies. Frequent use helps > to cure the chronic diarrhea that causes the loss of energy ... Its price > equals that of gold. Ming rulers obtained opium via the tributary system, when it was known as wuxiang () or \\"black spice\\". The Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty record gifts to successive Ming emperors of up to of wuxiang amongst tribute from the Kingdom of Siam, which also included frankincense, costus root, pepper, ivory, rhino horn and peacock feathers. First listed as a taxable commodity in 1589, opium remained legal until the end of Ming dynasty, 1637. Growth of the opium trade Storage of opium at a British East India Company warehouse In the 16th century the Portuguese became aware of the lucrative medicinal and recreational trade of opium into China, and from their factories across Asia chose to supply the Cantons, to satisfy both the medicinal and the recreational use of the drug. By 1729 the Yongzheng Emperor had criminalised the new recreational smoking of opium in his empire. Following the 1764 Battle of Buxar, the British East India Company (EIC) gained control of tax collection, along with the former Mughal emperors monopoly on the opium market, in the province of Bengal, this monopoly was formally incorporated into the company's activities via the East India Company Act, 1793. The EIC was ¬£28 million in debt as a result of the Indian war and the insatiable demand for Chinese tea in the UK market, which had to be paid for in silver. To redress the imbalance, the EIC began auctions of opium, offered in lieu of taxes, in Calcutta and saw its profits soar from the opium trade. Considering that importation of opium into China had been virtually banned by Chinese law, the East India Company established an elaborate trading scheme partially relying on legal markets and partially leveraging illicit ones. British merchants carrying no opium would buy tea in Canton (now known as Guangzhou) on credit, and balance their debts by selling opium at auction in Calcutta. From there, the opium would reach the Chinese coast hidden aboard British ships; it was then smuggled into China by native merchants. According to 19th Century sinologist Edward Parker, there were four types of opium smuggled into China from India: kung pan t'ou (ÂÖ¨Áè≠Âúü, gongban tu or \\"Patna\\"); Pak t'ou (ÁôΩÂúü, bai tu or \\"Malwa\\"); Persian, Kem fa t'ou (ÈáëËä±Âúü, jinhua tu) and the \\"smaller kong pan\\", which was of a \\"dearer sort\\", i.e. more expensive. A description of the cargo aboard at Lintin in July 1833 distinguished between \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" Patna, \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" Benares, and Malwa; the accounting also specifies the number of chests of each type, and the price per chest. The \\"chests\\" contained small balls of opium that had originated in the Indian provinces of Bengal and Madras. In 1797 the EIC further tightened its grip on the opium trade by enforcing direct trade between opium farmers and the British, and ending the role of Bengali purchasing agents. British exports of opium to China grew from an estimated in 1730 to in 1773 shipped in over two thousand chests.Salucci, Lapo (2007). Depths of Debt: Debt, Trade and Choices . University of Colorado. The Qing dynasty Jiaqing Emperor issued an imperial decree banning imports of the drug in 1799. By 1804 the trade deficit with China had turned into a surplus, leading to seven million silver dollars going to India between 1806 and 1809. Meanwhile, Americans entered the opium trade with less expensive but inferior Turkish opium and by 1810 had around 10% of the trade in Canton. Opium smokers c1880 by Lai Afong. In the same year the Emperor issued a further imperial edict: > Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and > morality. Its use is prohibited by law. Now the commoner, Yang, dares to > bring it into the Forbidden City. Indeed, he flouts the law! However, > recently the purchasers, eaters, and consumers of opium have become > numerous.

They should in no ways consider this order a dead letter and allow > opium to be smuggled out! The decree had little effect. The Qing government, far away in Beijing in the north of China, was unable to halt opium smuggling in the southern provinces. A porous Chinese border and rampant local demand facilitated the trade and by the 1820s China was importing of Bengali opium annually.Bertelsen, Cynthia (19 October 2008). \\"A novel of the British opium trade in China.\\" Roanoke Times & World News. The opium trafficked into China was processed by the EIC at its two factories in Patna and Benares. In the 1820s, opium from Malwa in the non- British controlled part of India became available, and as prices fell due to competition, production was stepped up. In addition to the drain of silver, by 1838 the number of Chinese opium addicts had grown to between four and twelve million and the Daoguang Emperor demanded action. Officials at the court who advocated legalizing and taxing the trade were defeated by those who advocated suppressing it. The Emperor sent the leader of the hard line faction, Special Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu, to Canton, where he quickly arrested Chinese opium dealers and summarily demanded that foreign firms turn over their stocks with no compensation. When they refused, Lin stopped trade altogether and placed the foreign residents under virtual siege in their factories, eventually forcing the merchants to surrender their opium. Lin destroyed the confiscated opium, a total of some 1,000 long tons (1,016 t), a process which took 23 days.  First Opium War  In compensation for the opium destroyed by Commissioner Lin British traders demanded compensation from their home government. However, British authorities believed that the Chinese were responsible for payment and sent expeditionary forces from India, which ravaged the Chinese coast in a series of battles and dictated the terms of settlement. The 1842 Treaty of Nanking not only opened the way for further opium trade, but ceded the territory of Hong Kong, unilaterally fixed Chinese tariffs at a low rate, gave Britain most favored nation status and permitted them diplomatic representation. Three million dollars in compensation for debts that the Hong merchants in Canton owed British merchants for the destroyed opium was also to be paid under Article V.  Taiping Rebellion  The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom opposed the usage of opium.Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795-1989 - Bruce A. Elleman - Google Books Fear that the Taiping forces would destroy opium stocks owned by foreign trades was one reason that Western powers joined the conflict on the side of the Qing dynasty.  Second Opium War  Despite the new ports available for trade under the Treaty of Nanking, by 1854 Britain's imports from China had reached nine times their exports to the country. At the same time British imperial finances came under further pressure from the expense of administering the burgeoning colonies of Hong Kong and Singapore in addition to India. Only the latter's opium could balance the deficit. Along with various complaints about the treatment of British merchants in Chinese ports and the Qing government's refusal to accept further foreign ambassadors, the relatively minor \\"Arrow Incident\\" provided the pretext the British needed to once more resort to military force to ensure the opium kept flowing. The Arrow was a merchant lorcha with an expired British registration that the Qing authorities seized for alleged salt smuggling. British authorities complained to the Governor-general of Liangguang, Ye Mingchen, that the seizure breached Article IX of the 1843 Treaty of the Bogue with regard to extraterritoriality. Matters quickly escalated and led to the Second Opium War, sometimes referred to as the \\"Arrow War\\" or the \\"Second Anglo-Chinese War\\", which broke out in 1856. A number of clashes followed until the war ended with the signature of the Treaty of Tientsin in 1860. Although the new treaty did not expressly legalise opium, it opened a further five ports to trade and for the first time allowed foreign traders access to the vast hinterland of China beyond the coast.  Aftermath of the Opium Wars  The treaties with the British soon led to similar arrangements with the United States and France. These later became known as the Unequal Treaties, while the Opium Wars, according to Chinese historians, represented the start of China's \\"Century of humiliation\\". The opium trade faced intense enmity from the later British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. As a member of Parliament, Gladstone called it \\"most infamous and atrocious\\" referring to the opium trade between China and British India in particular. Gladstone was fiercely against both of the Opium Wars and ardently opposed to the British trade in opium to China. He lambasted it as \\"Palmerston's Opium War\\" and said that he felt \\"in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China\\" in May 1840. Gladstone criticized it as \\"a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace,\\". His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of opium brought upon his sister Helen. Due to the First Opium war brought on by Palmerston, there was initial reluctance to join the government of Peel on part of Gladstone before 1841. Domestication and suppression in the last decades of the Qing dynasty Chinese opium smokers c. 1858 Once the turmoil caused by the mid- century Taiping Rebellion died down, the economy came to depend on opium to play several roles. Merchants found the substance useful as a substitute for cash, as it was readily accepted in the interior provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan while the drug weighed less than the equivalent amount of copper. Since poppies could be grown in almost any soil or weather, cultivation quickly spread. Local officials could then meet their tax quotas by relying on poppy growers even in areas where other crops had not recovered. Although the government continued to require suppression, local officials often merely went through the motions both because of bribery and because they wanted to avoid antagonizing local farmers who depended on this lucrative crop. One official complained that when people heard a government inspector was coming, they would merely pull up a few poppy stalks to spread by the side of the road to give the appearance of complying. A provincial governor observed that opium, once regarded as a poison, was now treated in the same way as tea or rice. By the 1880s, even governors who had initially suppressed opium smoking and poppy production now depended on opium taxes. China opium den, circa 1896The historian Jonathan Spence notes that the harm opium caused has long been clear, but that in a stagnating economy, opium supplied fluid capital and created new sources of taxes. Smugglers, poor farmers, coolies, retail merchants and officials all depended on opium for their livelihood. In the last decade of the dynasty, however, a focused moral outrage overcame these vested interests. reprinted in pp. 250‚Äì255 Opium growing areas of China, 1908 When the Qing government launched new opium suppression campaigns after 1901, the opposition no longer came from the British, whose sales had suffered greatly from domestic competition in any case, but from Chinese farmers who would be wiped out by the loss of their most profitable crop-derivative. Further opposition to the government moves came from wholesalers and retailers as well as from the millions of opium users, many of whom came from influential families. pp. 244‚Äì245. The government persevered, creating further dissent amongst the people, and at the same time promoted cooperation with international anti-narcotic agencies. Nevertheless, despite the imposition of new blanket import duties under the 1902 Mackay Treaty, Indian opium remained exempt and taxable at 110 taels per chest with the treaty stating \\"there was no intention of interfering with China's right to tax native opium\\". The International Opium Commission observed that opium smoking was a fashionable, even refined pastime, especially among the young, yet many in society condemned the habit. In 1907 Great Britain signed a treaty agreeing to gradually eliminate opium exports to China over the next decade while China agreed to eliminate domestic production over that period. Estimates of domestic production fell from in 1906 to in 1911. By the same year, the combination of foreign and domestic efforts proved largely successful, but the fall of the Qing government in 1911 effectively meant the end of the campaign. Local and provincial governments quickly turned back to opium as a source of revenue, and foreign governments no longer felt obliged to continue their efforts to eliminate the trade.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Bulletin on Narcotics: A Century of International Drug Control (Vienna, Austria: 2010) pp. 57‚Äì58 Opium Smokers in illegal den, Beijing (1932) In the northern provinces of Ningxia and Suiyuan in China, Chinese Muslim General Ma Fuxiang both prohibited and engaged in the opium trade. It was hoped that Ma Fuxiang would have improved the situation, since Chinese Muslims were well known for opposition to smoking opium. Ma Fuxiang officially prohibited opium and made it illegal in Ningxia, but the Guominjun reversed his policy; by 1933, people from every level of society were abusing the drug, and Ningxia was left in destitution. In 1923, an officer of the Bank of China from Baotou found out that Ma Fuxiang was assisting the drug trade in opium which helped finance his military expenses. He earned $2 million from taxing those sales in 1923. General Ma had been using the bank, a branch of the Government of China's exchequer, to arrange for silver currency to be transported to Baotou to use it to sponsor the trade. Since 1940, to solve financial crisis, the Chinese Communist Party government in Shaan-Gan-Ning had begun opium plantation and dealing, selling them to Japanese-occupied and Kuomintang provinces. The KMT government tried to send in an opium-prohibition inspection team but was turned down by the communists. The KMT Government under General Chiang Kai Shek employed the Green gang mob boss Du Yuesheng to head the Shanghai Opium Suppression Bureau. Remarked one American diplomat, \\"the real motive appears to be to increase revenues by drawing within the orbit of the Opium Suppression Bureau the opium traffic in the Settlement and French Concessions.\\" The KMT's definition of prohibition was a guise to extend their opium monopoly. \\"Suppression\\" officials talked openly of their duty to realize more opium revenue for the KMT government. During Kuomintang rule over the Republic of China opium trafficking was used for funds by Chiang Kai- shek.http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v08n03.pdf p. 19 Under Mao The Mao Zedong government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform. Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the Vietnam War, with 20 percent of soldiers regarding themselves as addicted during the peak of the epidemic in 1971. In 2003, China was estimated to have four million regular drug users and one million registered drug addicts.

The M12 operates between Columbus Circle and Abingdon Square, serving Manhattan's West Side. It uses 11th and 12th Avenues between 14th and 57th Streets. It was introduced in 2014 to provide better service to the far west side.  Current route  The M12 bus route begins at Abingdon Square in the West Village, and heads northbound on 8th Ave before turning left on 14th Street. Northbound buses use 15th Street to access 12th Avenue, whereas southbound buses use 18th Street and 9th Avenue. At 24th Street, the two directions split, with northbound buses using 12th Avenue and southbound buses using 11th Avenue. Passengers can transfer to the 7 train at 34th Street - Hudson Yards. This arrangement continues until 57th Street, where the M12 goes crosstown to 8th Avenue. It then terminates at 58th Street and Broadway, where passengers can connect to the 1, A, B, C, and D subways at 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle station  History  The MTA started planning for a far west side service in 2013, in conjunction with the 7 train's extension to 34 Street - Hudson Yards. It originally was planned to go from 59th Street to Spring Street, via the West Side Highway until 14th Street, and Washington/Greenwich Streets south of there. It was also scheduled to only run every 30 minutes. After numerous complaints by the community boards in the area, the route was redrawn in 2014. This routing was revised one more time to its current state, and the intervals changed to 20 minutes before the start of service on August 31, 2014.  Equipment  The M12 operates out of Michael J.

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 151st place out of 180 countries. According to Freedom House, since the election of Daniel Ortega in 2006, corruption had increased in Nicaragua.  Analysis  According to Foreign Policy, following his loss in the 1990 presidential election, Daniel Ortega spent the next decade building an alliances with former political enemies, which helped him win the 2006 presidential election. After assuming the presidency, Ortega used various means to maintain his power in Nicaragua. Ortega \\"used devious legal measures to harass those who refused to align with him\\", which included former allies and members of the Sandista front. Ortega then built an uneasy alliance with the business community, specifically Nicaragua's business organization COSEP, which resulted in less antagonism between his government and private business. This move by Ortega was similar to tactics used by the Somoza family dictatorship which ruled Nicaragua for the decades prior to Ortega's ascent. According to Freedom House, Nicaragua was among its Largest 10-Year Score Declines list in its Freedom in the World 2017 report, with the human rights organization stating: = Bribery = Some businesses have suggested that facilitation payments are demanded from the authorities when conducting commercial activities in Nicaragua and the government often shows favoritism towards certain well-connected companies. = Cronyism = The New York Times reports that when rising to power, Ortega often used union groups to protest and for other political motives. After taking power, he granted union leaders good positions within the Nicaraguan government. According to Foreign policy prior to his re-election in the 2016 election, Ortega's wife Rosario Murillo had gained power over much of the Nicaraguan government, controlling all of the social programs of the country. When Murillo became involved in politics, Nicaraguans began to compare President Ortega's family and political practices to that of the Somoza family dictatorship. By the time of the 2018‚Äì2020 Nicaraguan protests, The New York Times stated that Ortega and his wife hold power of the branches of government and media in Nicaragua. With this power, Ortega influenced judges and legislators to get rid of constitutional term limits, allowing Ortega to maintain power. Both opponents and supporters agreed that Ortega's wife, who was named vice president, held power over him in. Ortega's children have also been rewarded powerful positions within the government.  Anti-corruption efforts  Generally, Nicaragua has a well- developed legislative framework preventing and criminalizing corruption. Nicaragua has also signed several international agreements, such as the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. In practicality, Nicaragua's anti- corruption institutions are highly subject to political influences.

She was part of Prince's New Power Generation and as of 2016 is with Roadcase Royale, a band formed with Nancy Wilson and members of Heart. Personal life and career Warfield grew up the daughter of a Pentecostal deacon, listening to gospel music, in a strict background that didn't allow her to listen to secular music; she used to sing Whitney Houston songs to herself when her parents weren't around. She graduated from Peoria Notre Dame High School in 1997. Warfield later moved from Peoria to go to college in Portland, Oregon on a track scholarship at Portland State University. Her interest in public singing started at a karaoke club but she was so nervous on her first try that she sang with her back facing the audience. Eventually she became obsessed with performing to the point that she would attend daily and progressed to wearing wigs and costumes. At another establishment, she watched Linda Hornbuckle, who brought her onstage to sing, and again due to nervousness, Warfield sang with her back to the crowd. When she decided to pursue singing as a career, she dropped out of school and slept in her car. Her mother was initially upset to discover Warfield was singing and wanted to bring her back home, but eventually changed her mind and became supportive. In 2006, Warfield self-released her first album Embrace Me ‚Äì a collection of strong ballads. She did performances and sold her cds at a local market. =With Prince= Warfield's music career took off in 2009 after being selected as the newest member of Prince's New Power Generation two months after he took interest in a submitted video of her performing The Rolling Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\", and she subsequently auditioned for him. He mentored her, helping hone her stage presence and studio arrangement of her music. She toured with the band for five years. Warfield is featured on his album Lotusflow3r. Her second solo album, The Unexpected was released early 2014 with Prince as its Executive Producer and the New Power Generation providing horns; Prince also wrote the single under the same name for the album. After Prince died, Warfield performed at Celebration 2017, a multi-day tribute to his life and legacy held a year after his death, at Paisley Park. She said \\"I, personally, have a hard time dealing with loss. But this time for me, I felt at peace. I felt peaceful. That was my hope. That was my intention ‚Äî please let us see the light, despite all this other stuff going on.\\" =Roadcase Royale= In 2015, Warfield was chosen to be the opening act for Heart's Hollywood Bowl concert after Nancy Wilson had seen her on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and was impressed with her performance of \\"Why Do You Lie?\\". As a fan of the band's work, Warfield was excited to meet them and after the end of the show, she met up with Nancy Wilson. Wilson expressed an interest in Warfield's sound and later the women bonded over different songs they tried out together. The duo teamed up to form a new group called Roadcase Royale in 2016. Its style is rock, R&B; and ballads reflecting the sounds of both their respective bands. Lead guitarist Ryan Waters (the musical director for Warfield's solo work and Prince prot√©g√©), Heart keyboardist Chris Joyner, bassist Dan Rothchild, and drummer Ben Smith complete the band's membership. They released their first single, \\"Get Loud\\", in January 2017 and signed with Loud and Proud Records in July 2017. Their debut full-length album First Things First was released on September 22, 2017. The band was scheduled to open for Bob Seger on his 2017 Runaway Train tour for a number of appearances, but due to Seger's medical issues the original tour was cancelled. The postponed shows will again feature Roadcase Royale as the opening act on select dates. Awards and recognition VH1 Soul featured Warfield as a Soul You Oughta Know artist in early 2014. Warfield received a Soul Train Music Awards nomination in 2014 for Best New Artist and won for Stay ‚Äì \\"Soul Lifted\\" from The Unexpected in the Best Contemporary Jazz Performance category. Also in 2014, her home town of Peoria had a fundraising dinner reception and meet and greet with Warfield in conjunction with the Living to Serve Foundation, Inc. and The XFactor Agency to promote women's health and the George Washington Carver Center for youth.

Quadrant dentistry means that all the dental treatment required in a quadrant is carried out in a single appointment. This is perceived as convenient for some dentists and some patients, as fewer appointments are required overall. The dentition is divided into quadrants: * Upper right quadrant: upper right first incisor to upper right wisdom tooth * Upper left quadrant: upper left first incisor to upper left wisdom tooth * Lower right quadrant: lower right first incisor to lower right wisdom tooth * Lower left quadrant: lower left first incisor to lower left wisdom tooth Inferior alveolar nerve blocks anesthetize all the teeth in a lower quadrant, so it can be convenient as only one injection is required for quadrant dentistry carried out in the lower teeth.

In fact, corruption has become pervasive and has affected all sectors of the government and civil society including the executive, judiciary, police, and even the private sector.

Other causes include; personal interests & absence of duty conscience, weak judiciary & almost nonexistent opposition in the legislative, nepotism & favouritism, ineffective system of accountability, among others.

Two decades later, even though Cameroon does not top the said ranking any longer, it is still among the top 30 most corrupted countries in the world. The reasons for this ‚Äì according to Transparency International ‚Äì are; a weak judiciary, strong executive, and widespread poverty. Furthermore, transparency of the civil society and freedom of the press are still weak and efforts engaged to combat these have been extensively criticised by national and international actors.  Causes of Corruption In Cameroon  = Neopatrimonialism = As previously stated, neopatrimonialism is one of the main causes of corruption in Cameroon. D. Beekers, and B. van Gool (2012) define neopatrimonialism as ‚Äúa type of regime in which ruling elites use the state for personal enrichment and profit from a public administration that is patently unstable, inefficient, nontransparent, and that fails to distribute public resources to large segments of the population.‚Äù In a neopatrimonial state, real power and real decision-making lie outside its institutions (Chabal & Daloz, 1999; Bratton & van de Walle, 1997). Here, power is held not by high-ranking government officials, but by those who have connections/clientelist networks that exist inside and/or outside state structures (Cammack, 2007). Office power is used by civil servants who are void of the concept of the superior interest of the nation and instead motivated by personal uses and gains. Furthermore, government officials and members of parliament (MPs) account upwards ‚Äì to the president ‚Äì rather than downwards ‚Äì to the people. In this way, the president is able to control the local branches and institutions in order to prevent these local institutions/branches to ‚Äòrebel‚Äô against him. This is done by the central power (the government in general or the president) in a bid to maintain a firm grip on power at all cost, even if it means slowing down policy implementation. In Cameroon, the central government‚Äôs fear of losing power to local institutions is showcased by the lethargic ‚Äòimplementation‚Äô of the decentralisation law passed in 2004, but actually, the constitution of 1996 already mentioned the creation of a decentralised state. Till today, this law has never been fully implemented and in the meantime, the government has found a way to regain control of local institutions (should this law be fully implemented one day) by creating a position called d√©l√©gu√© du gouvernement (Government delegate). Local institutions (the mayor, etc.) will be under this government delegate and will report to him. The government delegate is appointed by the president of the republic and he accounts to the central government. In this way, the end product of the 2004 decentralisation law will resemble more the false product of a political devolution than anything else. = Tribalism = Very close to neopatrimonialism is the patronage system in Cameroon, in which local elections for example, are done based on particularistic divisions ‚Äì like ethnicity, religion ‚Äì in addition to how well the candidate is related to and has access to resources from the central government. In other words, they vote for the candidate who will best provide for them, based on the previously mentioned factors (ethnicity, religion, or both). This puts the population in a position of weakness and silence in the adverse of corruption. Nevertheless, this patronage system is equally beneficial to the local population because basic government services and access to basic necessities are difficult to obtain. This therefore privileges the route of corruption when choices are made and naturally deviates from transparent, meritocratic bureaucracies. = Other Causes = Cameroonian academics and political analysts have criticised the pervasive lack of accountability of corruption acts in Cameroon. This is due to the fact that government officials report upwards to the president, rather than downwards to the local people. This creates a situation where government officials are free of doing what they want without fear of public judgement. Another reason as coined by Fometeu J. (2001) is that the laws that sanction corruption are not adapted to the corruption environment of Cameroon. Cameroonian laws punish both the corrupter and the corrupted. This way of punishment does not encourage people to denounce corruption acts and further hinders the evidence of the offence. This is because firstly, almost all civil servants in Cameroon are corrupted and citizens have to bribe for the most basic government services (Fometeu J., 2001; p.348). Secondly, in order to obtain evidence of corruption made, the locals have to accept the bribery propositions made by civil servants. With this evidence, if they decide to denounce civil servants, both of them shall be convicted, which is wrong. Only the civil servant should be convicted because he is in a position of power and he is the one who further proposed to be bribed. Fometeu further argues that there is a lack of a conviction system proportional to the severity of the act of corruption committed, unwillingness of political leaders to submit themselves to scrutiny, that denunciation should be done freely without fear of backlashes, and the judiciary should be totally independent. Also, there is no strong opposition to condemn corruption acts because opposition leaders always switch sides based on their interests and when they do they condemn embezzlement, they are violently repressed. The police is instrumentalized against any political opposition. In addition to this is the almost non-existence of the opposition party in the National Assembly and Senate in Cameroon. The legislative is basically the ruling party‚Äôs (CPDM/RDPC) playground.  Corruption Under Paul Biya's Administration  = Lack Of Political Will = There has been a crucial lack of political will to fight against corruption in Cameroon under Biya's administration. Political will can be defined as \\"the demonstrated credible intent of political leaders (elected or appointed leaders, civil society watchdogs, stakeholder groups, etc.) to attack the perceived causes of effects of corruption at a systemic level\\". Political will is crucial in the fight against corruption as it sets the tone, creates the mood and exudes the degree of seriousness that is needed to engage everyone. Political will is equally important in order to punish corruption committed by top government officials who are from the ruling party and it will equally promote a good way of preaching by example. In addition, the fight against corruption is not affected by the availability of economic resources or lack thereof (Avitus A., 2019; pp. 70-71). Therefore, it is safe to say that the lack of political will demonstrated by Biya‚Äôs regime is not due to a lack of funds. President Biya himself, after about 4 decades in power has never fulfilled article 66 of the constitution of 1996 by declaring all his property and sources of income. This article 66 demands all government officials to declare their assets and sources of income before assuming a position in government so that it will be possible to measure what they have gained (or lost) during their tenancy. This is a credible means to fight against embezzlement, but Paul Biya has never declared any of his assets, under the helpless gaze of Cameroonians. President Biya created the CONAC (National Anti-Corruption Commission) in 2006 in order to actively fight corruption (mainly embezzlement). Indeed, the CONAC has done multiple arrests of top government officials in cases of the embezzlement of astronomical amounts of money. The notable ones being Marafa Hamidou Yaya, former Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation, arrested and convicted for having embezzled US$ 29 million in the case named \\"presidential jet\\" by local media, and more recently (March 2019), Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo‚Äôo, former Minister of Defence arrested on corruption charges with 3 billion FCFA (approx. US$ 5 million) recovered in cash at his residence, local media reported. These arrests and many others may all seem innocent and driven by Biya's goodwill to fight corruption, but Cameroon political analysts and academics see nothing but deception. Op√©ration √âpervier (Operation Sparrowhawk ‚Äì name given by local media for the seasonal arrests of high government officials convicted for corruption) is merely a way used by President Biya to eliminate his political opponents or officials from his own political party that he thinks have grown to accumulate too much power throughout their career and are starting to become a threat to him. Taking a closer look, Marafa Hamidou and Edgar Alain Mebe have both been very close to President Biya and have both worked as secretary general to the presidency of Cameroon ‚Äì a post that keeps you very close to the president. Both of them have held important positions in the government, positions that allow them to forge strategic networks and relations (both national and international) should they decide to run for presidency. President Biya‚Äôs strategy is to allow those close to him to embezzle and later on use it against them when he feels they become a threat. This further reinforces the idea that there is no real/genuine will to combat corruption. In addition, it is an opportunity for Biya‚Äôs regime to create an illusion of democracy and transparency as it has done in the past, more recently with the blatant use of sham Transparency International observers during the presidential elections of October 2018. David Wallechinsky ranked President of Cameroon Paul Biya with three others (Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, and King Mswati of Swaziland) as the most corrupt dictators in the world. He describes Cameroon's electoral process in these terms: \\"Every few years, Biya stages an election to justify his continuing reign, but these elections have no credibility.David Wallechinsky, \\"Tyrants: the World's 20 Worst Living Dictators\\", Regan Press, 2006, pp. 286‚Äì290 References External links *Cameroon Corruption Profile from the Business-Anti-Corruption Portal Cameroon Category:Crime in Cameroon by type Category:Politics of Cameroon ","title":"Corruption in Cameroon"},{"id":"42295809","text":"Sir Reginald St George Smallridge Bond (10 April 1872 - 27 July 1955) was a British medical doctor and Royal Navy administrator.‚ÄòBOND, Surgeon Vice- Admiral Sir Reginald (St George Smallridge)‚Äô, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 24 March 2014 He was Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, 1931‚Äì1934; and Honorary Physician to the King at the same time.

Although the band only released 10 songs commercially, outtakes, radio sessions, demos and unreleased material have surfaced on several bootleg CDs originating from Japan with the most popular title being \\"Destroy All Melody\\" which features live performances from 1992 and a recording of \\"Ticket To Ride\\" performed with Bob Mould.

The band members were Jez Housden on Bass and former Guns n' Wankers and Wildhearts drummer, Pat Walters. The group eventually signed to Richard Branson's V2 label and released 5 singles. The third single \\"Mr. Wilson\\" was Carroll's tribute to Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, the lyrics almost entirely consisting of Beach Boys song titles. Brian Wilson heard the track and Carroll was invited to the legendary songwriter's birthday show at New York City's Beacon Theatre in 1999. An album, Where Old Ghosts Meet (a reference from On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh) was released in 1998 but deleted the same week.

It opened on December 15, 2017 in Downtown Halifax, replacing the older World Trade and Convention Centre. The Halifax Convention Centre is part of the $500-million Nova Centre project. With of mixed-use space, Nova Centre is the largest integrated development project undertaken in Nova Scotia‚Äôs history.  History  = Background = Trade Centre Limited (TCL), the provincial Crown corporation that operated the World Trade and Convention Centre, advocated replacing the facility to accommodate demand for larger scale conventions, citing the lack of a dedicated exhibition room and the larger size of comparable facilities elsewhere in the country. In 2008, Trade Centre Limited and the provincial Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal issued an expression of interest for an expanded facility. This process identified a successful proponent, Rank Inc., a private developer. It was announced that Rank Inc. would build the overall development, called Nova Centre, in which the convention centre would be located. In August 2011, the federal government announced it would invest $51 million toward eligible construction costs for the new convention centre. The remaining funding was shared by the Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality, with each contributing $56.4 million. With funds in place for the convention centre portion of the project, the developer, Rank Inc., continued to work on preliminary designs and securing tenants for the other aspects of the Nova Centre project. In July 2012, Rank Inc. CEO Joe Ramia officially announced his intention to proceed with the project, beginning with wide-ranging public consultation to help inform the look and feel, streetscape and public spaces for the Nova Centre. That same month Regional Council gave its final approval to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Province of Nova Scotia that outlines the construction, operational and financial agreements surrounding the new convention centre. Auditor General Jacques Lapointe, in 2012, criticized the market study used to justify construction of the new convention centre. Without questioning the general merits of a new facility, he stated that \\"some industry realities were ignored\\" and provided new calculations which suggested that the economic spinoff could be significantly diminished if the expected utilization rate was lower than calculated. Trade Centre CEO Scott Ferguson responded by stating that he stood by the original projections. The branding and name of the facility, Halifax Convention Centre, were announced in early 2014 by Ferguson, who praised the \\"simplicity\\" and marketing sense of the name and graphic identity. =Development = In November 2014, the developer confirmed a substantial completion date of September 30, 2016, for the Nova Centre, with an official opening for the Halifax Convention Centre planned for January 2017. In April 2014, the province introduced the Halifax Convention Centre Act, legislation that will see the provincial government and the Halifax Regional Municipality establish the Halifax Convention Centre Corporation to manage and operate the new facility. The legislation requires the two levels of government to jointly appoint a board of directors. Once in place, the board will set and implement the strategic direction for the corporation. Convention centre under construction in 2015 The developer updated information in its planning application to amend the Downtown Halifax Secondary Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law and its request to close and acquire Grafton Street. This proposal went before the Design Review Committee on March 20 and was subsequently approved and recommended to Regional Council on April 1, 2014. A public hearing was held April 29, 2014, to discuss the proposed amendments and to consider the closure of Grafton Street to accommodate the new design of the Nova Centre, specifically bringing the ballroom of the Halifax Convention Centre above ground. This new design arises from public feedback gathered during the consultations in 2012. In the end, Council approved the amendments and asked municipal staff to look into options for the closure of Grafton Street. The developer presented the final design of the building to the Design Review Committee through a substantive site plan approval application. The Committee approved the application, with conditions, at a special meeting on June 12, 2014. On June 10, 2014, Council discussed the sale of Grafton Street and subsequently approved the sale to Argyle Developments at a price of $1.9 million. The sale closed on August 14.  Facility  The new convention centre comprises over of meeting space, including a ballroom, of multi-purpose convention space, and of meeting space. It was constructed on a site comprising two city blocks bounded by Prince, Argyle, Sackville, and Market streets, bisected by Grafton Street which has been temporarily closed and destroyed to permit excavation and construction. One of the two blocks was previously the longstanding head office of The Chronicle Herald, who relocated to Armdale. The convention centre is part of a larger development called Nova Centre, composed of the convention centre podium with office, residential, and hotel space above. The entire development has been stated to be about in total.

One block was formerly home to the longtime headquarters of the Halifax Chronicle-Herald newspaper. The project has received federal, provincial, and municipal public funding as it will house, in the podium levels and basement, the new Halifax Convention Centre operated by the Crown corporation Trade Centre Limited (TDL). In 2014, Halifax Regional Council approved the sale of a section of Grafton Street, running through the Nova Centre site, to Argyle Developments at a cost of $1.9 million.

This was the pair's second collaboration, after Erased James Franco. Production Franco plays a character who was an actor in a soap opera prior to the events in the film. The character's history led the director Carter to encourage Franco to acquire a role in a soap opera in real life. Franco took the advice and was able to land a role on General Hospital playing the eponymous character Franco, an artist and serial killer. In interviews, Carter and Franco have explained the decision as an attempt to help Franco understand his character in Maladies, as part of a series of performance art pieces accompanying the film's release, as a joke, and as some combination of all those things. Franco would ultimately use a great deal of the General Hospital footage as part of another experimental film, Francophenia. Plot Maladies is divided into chapters, titled \\"Feelings\\", \\"Symmetry\\", and \\"I See You\\". The course of the narrative lacks a specific timeframe; although the environment, setting and costumes appears designed for the early 1960s, repeated allusions to the cult leader Jim Jones in the film are somewhat jolting, as the footage of Jones used is from 1978. The film follows the foibles of its four main characters as they seek to resolve \\"maladies\\" that make it difficult for them to relate with one another and cope with themselves. James (James Franco) is an ex-TV star turned writer who finds himself unable to complete a novel. Patricia (Fallon Goodson), James' sister, is unable to speak. Catherine (Catherine Keener), their house-painter, is a cross-dresser. And Delmar, their neighbor (David Strathairn), must struggle with his unrequited love for James. Reception Maladies premiered in 2013 at the Berlin International Film Festival and the SXSW film festival in Austin. Critics have tended to dismiss the film, which has a decidedly \\"art-house\\" style, as opaque and obscurantist. The LA Times called Maladies \\"tedious\\". NPR mocked claims from Franco and Carter that the movie is a performance art piece and said Maladies is a \\"firehose\\".

The dynasty began when Wu Zhao, which was Wu Zetian's personal name, usurped the throne of her son, the Emperor Ruizong of Tang, and lasted until Emperor Zhongzong of Tang was restored to the throne. Historians generally view the Wu Zhou as an interregnum of the Tang dynasty. The sole ruler of Wu Zhou was Wu Zetian. She took the name \\"Wu Zetian\\" upon her coronation. Wu named her dynasty after the ancient Zhou dynasty, from whom she believed herself to be descended. Background Before her coronation, Wu Zhao (as she was then known), was often acting as de facto regent for her husband, Emperor Gaozong, or her sons, giving her a head-start in accomplishing her aims, which she then consolidated as huangdi of Zhou once she became ruler in name also. Beginning in 655, Wu began to preside over court meetings in the name of the emperor. After Gaozong's death, she ruled in name of her sons, who reigned officially as puppet emperors. In 690, she deposed her son, Emperor Ruizong, and declared herself Huangdi (emperor) of her Zhou Dynasty. History Longmen Grottoes, begun before the life of Wu Zetian, she contributed greatly to them, both as wife of Gaozu and during her subsequent Zhou dynasty. In 2000 the site was inscribed upon the UNESCO World Heritage List as \\"an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity\\" The dynasty's capital was ShenduBuddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of India‚ÄìChina Relations , Tansen Sen (Á•ûÈÉΩ \\"Divine Capital\\", present-day Luoyang). Despite Wu's infamous rise to power, there is evidence that suggests women were granted more privileges during her reign, and China was in a state of great prosperity during her rule. The dynasty's state religions were Buddhism and Daoism, both of which Wu Zetian exploited for self-promoting propaganda.Paludan 1998, 100 The monk Xue Huaiyi claimed to have found a document predicting the reign of a woman of great merit who would become universal ruler Paludan 1998, 99 In support of her imperial ambitions, Wu Zetian also proclaimed herself \\"Sage Mother\\", having statues of Laozi's mother as \\"Sage Mother\\" placed in Daoist templesPaludan 1998, 100-101 Wu Zetian became a very active supporter of Buddhism, Furthermore, she claimed to be an incarnation of Maitreya, writing a document called the Great Cloud Sutra, which prophesied that a female emperor would eradicate illness, worry and disaster from the world. She sought the support of the Buddhist clergy to this end. In 673 Wu provided 20,000 cash for a gigantic statue of Maitreya at Longmen Grottoes.Paludan 1998, 99 Unlike her predecessor's dynasty, Wu Zetian selected people in her government based on their skills, and not on their status. The Buddhist clergy created a document called Commentary on the Meaning of the Prophecy about Shenhuang, which predicted a female Chakravartin who would rule the Jambudvipa as the reincarnation of Vimalaprabha. This document was presented to Wu Zetian two months before the proclamation of the Zhou Dynasty. Various other documents were also written such as The Great Spell of Unsullied Pure Light, also predicting the rise of a female monarch, of which Wu Zetian ordered 100,000 copies be printed and distributed.The Woman Who Discovered Printing, T.H. Barrett Traditionalist Chinese historiography considers the dynasty as a period of the Tang dynasty, as Wu was also the former empress consort of a Tang emperor and was buried in Qianling Mausoleum, a Tang royal mausoleum. Furthermore, Wu Zetian was the only emperor of Zhou China, which does not fit the concept of a dynasty. There were, however, other dynasties of a similar length, such as the Xin dynasty, or much shorter in length, such as the Shun dynasty. Wu Zetian's rule was long also seen as a period of great tyranny, though in more recent decades this seems to have lessened or reversed, as the appearance of Wu Zetian in countless Chinese works of fiction seems to depict her as a wise ruler. Nevertheless, historically (rather than according to novels) her reign began and continued with extensive violence, combined with the use of secret police and a network of informers. The debate about Wu's use of violence and coercion is more as to how some of it may have been exaggerated and how much of it was necessary for her own survival, particularly given the animosity of the clans of old nobility of the northern China plain that adamantly opposed her, together with a social and political system which found a woman of her accomplishments to be anathema solely on the basis of gender. Achievements Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, re-built during Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty The Unwritten Monument, erected by Wu Zetian without the usual inscribing of text, due to her view that what she had to express was too sublime to be expressed in words. Located in the Qianling Mausoleum. The \\"Zhou dynasty\\" or reign of Wu Zetian had many achievements both in a broader historical sense as well as in contrast to the reigns of Zhongzong and Ruizong whose reigns bracketed hers, and in contrast to her weak and sickly husband Emperor Gaozong of Tang. Wu's reign resulted in a greater level of Chinese imperial power both externally and internally. This was accomplished along with diminishing the power of the old official class, drawn from the traditionally powerful clans, thus greatly changing the dynamics of power in China. Wu Zetian greatly enhanced the prestige and effectiveness of the civil service recruitment tests, filling government positions by skills demonstrated in written examinations, and opening them up to men of all classes. She followed this with popular promotions and increased salaries. Wu issued Acts of Grace and other decrees of relief for the commons, and funded religious activities. However, toward the end of her reign she lost popular support due to the influence of the two young Zhang brothers she took as lovers and the resulting corruption in government. When her court officials intervened, they killed the Zhang brothers, Wu Zetian abdicated the next day, and the so-called Zhou dynasty fizzled to an end with the restoration of the Tang.Paludan 1998, 96-101 Nevertheless, some of Wu Zetian's achievements have left their mark on history, such as the emphasis in subsequent Chinese history on merit-based examinations, as well as extant monuments, including huge parts of Longmen Grottoes. Wu Zetian was personally an author and poet, with many surviving works, including sixty-one essays under her name recorded in the Quan Tangwen \\"Collected Tang Essays\\" and forty-six poems collected in the Quan Tangshi anthology of Tang poetry. Wu Zetian and her court left a remarkable legacy of poetry and literature from the end of Gaozu's reign and even more so during her Zhou dynasty period, during which the Zhuying ji poetry anthology was published, the poets of which were very influential to the subsequent flourishing of Tang poetry. Thus, though the Zhou dynasty failed to take root as an actual dynasty, it was one of the more important eras in Chinese history, and of influence on modern global culture.

The series chronicled the rise of popular soccer star Tony \\"Matador\\" Bravo (Gabriel Luna), known for his exploits both on and off the field. Unbeknownst to the public and his family, he is also a skilled covert operative performing missions for a branch of the CIA. The series premiered on July 15, 2014, on the newly launched channel El Rey Network. Executive producers are showrunners Beattie and Dworkin, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Heather Kadin of K/O Paper Products, and Robert Rodriguez along with FactoryMade Ventures and El Rey Network co-founders John Fogelman and Cristina Patwa. Beattie and Dworkin wrote the first episode, which was directed by Rodriguez. Despite originally being renewed for a second season prior to its premiere, El Rey canceled the show, citing a lack of international success. Plot In this scripted action series, Tony Bravo (Gabriel Luna) is a DEA agent recruited by the CIA to infiltrate the Los Angeles Riot, a professional soccer team. The CIA suspects the Riot's owner, Andr√©s Galan (Alfred Molina), of using his vast resources to fund illicit activities. During team tryouts, Bravo seriously injures one of the Riot players in a confrontation on the field, initially earning the ire of the owner and the team. When footage of the incident goes viral, earning Bravo the nickname \\"Matador\\", Galan sees marketing potential in his popular new star.

Since 1986, she has been with the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet where she is a principal dancer. Along with Ulyana Lopatkina, Makhalina is a member of 'the basketball team', a group of Kirov dancers who are characterized for being especially tall and slender. Biography Born in Leningrad, she trained under Marina A. Vasilieva at the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, graduating in 1985. Her father, Viktor Makhalin, is an engineer and her mother Anna is an accountant. Makhalina's teachers at the academy reportedly told her she would be only a corps de ballet dancer and after graduation she had signed on with a company in Lvov, but she was accepted into the Kirov after attracting the notice of then artistic director Oleg Vinogradov. Makhalina danced the leading role of Medora in Le Corsaire during her first season with the company. Ghe was approached by Gennady Schreiber to learn the lead role in Swan Lake during her first year with the company, which was an unusual offer for an inexperienced dancer. Olga Moiseyeva, who was renowned for her interpretation of the white swan Odette coached Makhalina for the part. She was often partnered in this ballet by Andris Liepa. In 1990, her interpretation of Odette-Odile with partner Igor Zelensky was filmed at the Mariinsky Theater. A member of the Mariinsky Ballet since 1986, she has performed the leading roles in Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Le Corsaire and Anna Karenina. Her repertoire has included the major classical ballets as well as works choreographed by George Balanchine including Theme and Variations, Scotch Symphony, Apollo, The Prodigal Son and Symphony in C. Makhalina's role debuts with the Kirov/Mariinsky included Myrtha (1986) and the title role (1991) in Giselle, Medora (1987) in Le Corsaire, Odette/Odile (1987) in Swan Lake, Gamzatti (1988) and Nikiya (1990) in La Bayad√®re, Kitri (1989) in Don Quixote, Lilac Fairy (1989) in Sleeping Beauty, title role (1994) in Raymonda, and Countess of Elba (1996) in Goya Divertissement. She has also performed the title roles in Roland Petit's Carmen and in Kenneth MacMillan's Manon. Exotic roles have included Zobeide in Scheherazade and Death in The Youth and Death, while supporting roles have included the evil stepmother in Cinderella. She has also performed as a soloist at the Royal Danish Ballet, Berlin's Deutsche Oper, the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires and at the Paris Opera. In Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre, she has danced in Swan Lake, La Bayad√®re and The Firebird. In 2014, it was announced that Makhalina would return to Montreal's \\"Gala des √âtoiles du ballet russe\\", known as \\"Don des √âtoiles\\" in 1988 when she first appeared at the event. With a repertoire of 40 roles, Makhalina also has outside interests in areas such as architecture and nature. Reviews After a 1989 performance as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis in the ballet blanc scene of the Romantic ballet Giselle, a review published in New York Magazine described her as having \\"extraordinarily long limbs\\" and a \\"calm, majestic command\\" over her body while performing slower movements, but noted that her phrasing became \\"disconnected\\" while performing big leaps or petit allegro combinations that require fast footwork. That same year The Washington Post published a review praising her \\"voluptuous melanchony\\" in the White Swan Adagio excerpt from the second act of Swan Lake. During the Kirov Ballet's 1992 performance of Swan Lake at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, a reviewer for The New Leader wrote: \\"Although Makhalina is impressive standing still, when she moves one can see what she is missing: liberty. She has 'plastique' but lacks pulse and impulse; each step is labored, exact to a fault.\\" Makhalina received a positive review from New York Magazine in 1995 for her performance as Zobeide in Mikhail Fokines Scheherazade. Dance critic Tobi Tobias wrote that \\"what was most endearing was her willing participation in a tale that, to a contemporary audience, is likely to seem ludicrously primitive and overblown\\". Nina Alovert, a well known ballet photographer and writer, wrote that she first took note of Makhalina in 1987 during a performance of Paquita writing that Makhalina \\"immediately stood out among several young dancers with her 180-degree extension\\", noting also her \\"soft landing\\" during jumps. Like other reviewers, she also noted Makhalina's \\"physical beauty\\".

Early years After a short professional career in banking and industry, he studied economics in Paris, Vienna and T√ºbingen, where he finished his studies and wrote a thesis about Bolshevism in 1919. In the same year, he moved to the Netherlands. World War II From 1929 until 1944 he lived in Amsterdam. Mautner never married and had no children. On 22 July 1941, he drew up a will in which he appointed his brother in Ohio in the United States as his sole heir. During the war Mautner attempted unsuccessfully to escape from the Nazi regime.All the information used for this article is from the Restitutions Committee [RC. 1.89]-[9 February 2009], unless otherwise specified. Mautner tried to get an exit visa for the United States with the help of his brother, who lived in New York.

Mautner died on or around 29 September 1944 in Auschwitz concentration camp. Art collection Mautner collected paintings. His collection also included some Dutch old masters. He continued purchasing works of art during the war. At that time he was in frequent contact with Max Jakob Friedlander. From 1941, he was no longer able to do so in his own name because of his Jewish origins. He gave works of art to various people for safekeeping. In February 1942, Mautner was ordered to move to Tugelaweg in Amsterdam as a result of the forced relocation of Jews. He sent 15 paintings for safe-keeping with the collector Dr J. van Dongen on the city's Museumplein. The latter kept all of these items until after the war. Other works, including a Brueghel and a Timmermann, were sold under duress in 1943 by Mautner. Various of Mautner's works of art and other possessions were recovered for his heirs, by custodians of his estate after the war. The 15 paintings in J.A. van Dongen's custody were probably bought by van Dongen with the consent of Mautner's heirs.

It is now a parish church and contains many valuable art objects. History In 1596 the Jesuits first built a chapel. Soon after they started building a church with a college, a convent, a chapel and garden. Formal construction of the church took place between 1619 and 1641 after a design by local Jesuit architect Pieter Huyssens (1577-1637). After his death, his fellow Jesuit J. Boul√© took over the supervision of the construction works. The original designs of Huyssens with respect to the tower, the vault and windows of the nave were not fully executed due to financial constraints and rivalry among the Jesuits of Bruges and Antwerp. The church was dedicated to St. Francis Xavier by Msgr. Nicolas de Haudrion in 1642. In 1773 the Jesuit Order was dissolved and the church closed by imperial decree. The Jesuit church was taken over as parish church in 1777 as the original parish church was dilapidated. The parish church was demolished in 1781 and its furnishings sold to finance the restoration of the decaying Jesuit church. In 1779 the former Jesuit church was inaugurated as a parish church and the relics of St. Walburga were transferred to it. The church was turned into a Temple of the Law in 1796 by the French occupiers. The church recovered its religious function under the name \\"St. Donatian Church\\" in 1805 after the transfer of the relics of Saint Donatian from the dilapidated church of the same name. In 1854 the church was unofficially awarded its current name. The church incurred heavy damage mainly to the northern aisle due to a bomb explosion in 1918.De Inventaris van het Onroerend Erfgoed: Sint-Walburgakerk (ID: 29708) Exterior The stone fa√ßade was inspired by the Church of the Ges√π in Rome. The structure of the church consists of an aisled nave of seven bays and built-in choir with one bay and an apse. The building was constructed with bricks while sandstone was used for the fa√ßade. Interior View of the interior Inside, the Baroque character is strengthened by mouldings, volutes, broken pediments, and pilasters and columns, which create light effects. The floor of the choir has geometric motives and it has been claimed that they represent an ancient Arabic language called Kufic.Sint-Walburgakerk geeft groot geheim prijs The church holds several paintings in the choir, aisles and above the rood screen including: 14 paintings on the Fifteen mysteries of the rosary from the circle of Jan Anton Garemyn (1750), the Glorification of the Holy Sacrament by Jan Anton Garemyn (1740s), the Coronation of Our Lady by Erasmus Quellinus II (17th century), the Lamentation of Christ by Joseph Denis Odevaere (1812), the Resurrection by Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e (18th century), the Vision of St. Ignatius by P. Cassiers, a triptych of Our Lady of the Dry Tree by Pieter Claeissens the Younger (1620) and an anonymous canvas of St. Domenic healing a child. The church has a monumental marble altar by Jacob Cocx (dedicated in 1643) with a statue of St. Walburga by Houvenaegel (1842). Above the portals are placed busts of St. Francis Xavier and St. Francis Borgia and statues of St. Aloysius Gonzaga and St. Stanislaus Kostka. Detail of the communion rails by Hendrik Frans Verbrugghen The northern side altar is by Pieter Verbrugghen I (1657) with two Baroque portals and various statues of saints dating from the 17th century. The southern side altar is also by Pieter Verbrugghen I (1669) and has oak doors and statues of St. Peter, St. Paul and St. Rochus. The white marble communion rails were made by Hendrik Frans Verbrugghen in 1695. These rails are a high point of Flemish Baroque sculpture. Because of the virtuoso treatment of the marble they appear to be modeled in wax.Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Pieter Verbrugghen II.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. 21 March 2014 The confessionals in classicizing style date from 1802. The oak choir stalls and communion rails are from the 18th century. The Baroque pulpit is a work of Artus Quellinus II (1670) and was made on the basis of the iconography of Willem Hesius. The organ case was commenced in 1735 by Frenchman Cornil Cacheux and completed by Jean Baptiste Fremat in 1739. It is decorated with statues of graceful women and Jesus on the Globe.

Legends =Wangen= Places now lost are remembered in legend. A town called \\"Wangen\\" between Hossingen and Me√üstetten has now disappeared. An as- yet undiscovered Celtic town of Pyrene was mentioned in ancient sources. The identification of Pyrene would bring special honor to researchers, since it is the oldest town in the Upper Danube region known from written sources. The locality \\"Neu-Wangenhausen\\" (N√ºwenghausen), mentioned in a document from 1477, could be no other place in the district. The microtoponyms (flurnames) of the mountaintop \\"Weng\\" in the Heuberg Training Area and \\"Wangen\\" by the radar installation are in common use. =Antiquities= During the construction of a drainage ditch Alfred Ludwig Oetinger, pastor in Me√üstetten und Hossingen from 1856 to 1868, discovered a bronze cauldron and potsherds near the Weichenwang. To the great derision of the workmen he secured the finds and forwarded them for scientific evaluation. Around 1850 the area was a frequent target of grave robbers. The pastor then carried out systematic excavations, first on his own, and later on behalf of the \\"Staatssammlung vaterl√§ndischer Alterth√ºmer\\" (State Collection of Patriotic Antiquities). The investigators documented unique finds of Celtic wagon burials with preserved wooden pieces and jeweled harness fittings. In 1869 it was impossible to exactly date the finds. Without evidence a very extensive, but short-lived, settlement was postulated at the time of the burials. =Hemmadh√§ddler= An old story talks about the Hemmadh√§ddlers, which are said to appear at certain times. A bold teamster from Tieringen was driving an empty wagon over the Weichenwang to Baienberg with a group of men from Hausen am Tann. At midnight he chanced to invoke the Hemmadh√§ddlers. All passengers survived the encounter with the apparitions, but they had to cut the traces of the skittish horses and abandon the wagon stuck in the deep loam. =Schimmelreiter's secret love-affair= Another old tale tells of a spectral rider on a white horse (Schimmelreiter), who secretly visited his lover on the Weichenwang. Many times in stormy autumn weather a Schimmelreiter is said to be seen riding toward the Weichenwang (Heiligenwang) from the old castle of Burtel near Hossingen, the remains of which are visible today. Regarding the couple, there was a recorded relationship between a knight and the daughter of the lord of the castle, whose homes are said to be the castles of Hossingen and Tierburg. In 1898, Emil Schweizer included a version of this story in his article on the Balingen Mountains (Balinger Bergen). More vague evidence occurs in an old document: the noble knight Kunz acquired a castle in Me√üstetten on July 14, 1327, from the Lord of Bubenhofen. It may be that lord of Castle Hossingen in financial difficulties so that he had to pawn his fiefdom to the rich lord of Bubenhofen. Perhaps the Schimmelreitier was Kunz, from Neuentierberg Castle, and had he acquired for his beloved her father's castle in Hossingen.

Accident At 2:50 a.m. local time (07:50 UTC), a passenger train overran the bumper at . The front car of the eight-car train partially ascended an escalator. While a spokesman initially stated that it was likely that the train entered the station at too high a speed, later estimates indicated that the train entered the station at , which was not an excessive speed. At least 50 firefighters and paramedics responded to the accident. Thirty-four people were injured. They were taken to the Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, the Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center, the Resurrection Hospital and the Swedish Covenant Hospital. O'Hare station; the train involved in the accident used the center track, with no train on it in the photo Following the accident, the line between O'Hare and was closed, with a replacement bus service in place. A CTA spokesman initially stated that the line could be closed for as long as 48 hours while recovery of the train was undertaken. This was later revised upwards to a week. The front two cars of the train were damaged in the accident. Damage was estimated at $6,000,000. On March 26, work began to scrap the lead car on site. The derailed train was removed from the station on March 27. The station reopened on March 30, 2014 at 2:00 p.m. The escalator damaged in the crash was replaced by stairs. Damage amounted to $11,196,796. Train Photographs show that the train involved in the accident was made up of four two-car 2600-series trainsets, with 3061/3062 as the leading pair. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened an investigation into the accident. Investigators focused on the theory that the motorwoman, 25-year-old Brittney Tysheka Haywood, fell asleep at the controls. She stated that she had recently performed \\"a lot of overtime\\". When interviewed by the NTSB, she admitted falling asleep at the controls and disclosed that she had done a similar thing the previous month, which resulted in an overshoot at (Blue) on February 1. She did not reveal to CTA that she had fallen asleep when questioned about the overshoot. The investigation was hampered by the train's lack of a train event recorder, although it was fitted with a video camera. The recording from the camera was examined. Images from 41 cameras within the station were also studied. The NTSB's report ultimately confirmed the original findings. Aftermath As a direct consequence of the accident, the CTA reduced the speed limit into the O'Hare station from to . The area of the speed limit was also extended away from the station. The train operator was fired.

Initially formed as a solo project by multi-instrumentalist Jordan Hudson, the act's sole full-length album, Warmer, was released in 2000. Biography Jordan Hudson and guitarist Zak Riles moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s from their home state of Florida. There, they met bassist Victwa and played one live show together before moving to Portland, Oregon. The 21-year-old Hudson composed the songs that would make up the album Warmer from his Portland home. The album, for which recording took over two years to complete, contains 13 songs and features 30 different \\"instruments\\" ranging from drums and guitars to household appliances to items such as door hinges and a tire iron. Warmer was released in September 2000 on Hush Records. In a review of the album, Peter J. D'Angelo of Allmusic wrote: \\"This is one of those records that are special enough to avoid being pigeonholed. All types of songwriting are pulled off expertly, though the lack of vocals on some of the softer tracks does leave a slightly empty feeling.\\" A Tiny Mix Tapes review stated: \\"It's refreshing [...] to hear experimental music that doesn't rely on distortion or minimalism to test the boundaries of song, but rather approaches the fledgling science with a foot in the classics.\\" Julianne Shepherd of The Portland Mercury described the band's mostly-instrumental music as \\"dark\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", and said: \\"There's simply no need for vocals; their guitars sing a communicative melody, and their drums are acute, yet easy--subtly textured beats that balance technicality and danceability.\\" The Operacycle toured the United States during the autumn of 2000 and performed at the College Music Journal (CMJ) music festival in New York. In addition to Warmer, the group has appeared on various self-titled and split EPs. In early 2002, Hudson became the founding drummer for The Thermals, while Riles joined Grails as lead guitarist. In addition, both Hudson and Riles performed and recorded for many years with M. Ward.

She represented Germany in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2008), and also often played as a midfielder and an experienced central defender. Bachmann was also a member of the Germany women's national field hockey team who attained a great success in the mid and late 2000s, capturing three gold medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics, 2006 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy, and 2007 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship.  Career  Bachmann started playing field hockey at the age of five under the influence of her father Hans-Gerd Bachmann, a former player for the West German team and 1978 EuroHockey Nations champion. Bachmann began training for the junior squad at HTC Uhlenhorst M√ºlheim, until she joined the Club Raffelberg Duisberg in 1996. Four years later, she was officially selected to the women's senior national team, and eventually competed in numerous field hockey tournaments across Germany and the rest of Europe. From 2004 to 2008, Bachmann played for Eintracht Braunschweig hockey club. From 2009 to 2014, she played for Dutch club Oranje Zwart. Bachmann made her official debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she competed as a member of the German squad in the women's field hockey tournament. Collecting a total of two triumphs, two losses, and six classification points in the group stage, Bachmann helped her squad defeat China in the semifinals through a penalty knock-out, and later, scored a goal of 2‚Äì1 to upset the daunting Dutch team for her nation's first ever gold medal in Olympic sporting history. Adding to a laundry list of her accomplishments, Bachmann continued a winning streak for the Germans by taking home two more golds in the women's tournament at the 2006 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy in Amstelveen, Netherlands, and at the 2007 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship in Manchester, England. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Bachmann qualified for the second time as a member of the German squad and defending champion in the women's field hockey tournament after receiving an automatic berth from the EuroHockey Nations Championships. Unlike the previous Games, she and the rest of the German squad could not capitalize on their last chance for a penalty corner at the final second, and were defeated in the semifinal match against China with a set score of 2‚Äì3. In the bronze medal final, Bachmann and her teammates shortened their chances of a medal, as the Germans lost the match to World No. 2 Argentina with a score of 1‚Äì3. Bachmann continued to compete for the German women's senior team until she temporarily retired in 2010. Three years later, she sought her sights to return to the team after being called for its configuration by new coach Jamilon M√ºlders. On that same year, at the 2013 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship in Boom, Belgium, Bachmann reclaimed her status in the international hockey stage, as she and the Germans outclassed the Brits for a gold medal through a penalty shootout and a thrilling 4‚Äì4 draw in their first final after 22 years. In addition to the prestigious EuroHockey trophy, Bachmann had been elected as the Best Player of the Tournament. Since 2014, Bachmann is the head coach of the men's team of Uhlenhorster HC.

Dutton.Guide to First Edition Prices 2004/5, Tartarus Press It is the story of the creation of a new religion, Cavism, which quickly comes to replace the established but failing Christian religion.  Plot summary  The novel is written as the memoir of Eugene Luther, one of the first followers of Cavism, founded by John Cave, an American undertaker. Cave teaches, among other things, not to fear death and to actually desire it under certain circumstances. Later followers come to glorify death, and even enforce it on other members. The founder John Cave is himself killed by his followers when he proves inconvenient for the new religion's development. Eventually, Cavism is successful in completely displacing and exterminating Christianity, even to the extent of all Gothic Cathedrals being systematically blown up and destroyed in order to erase any memory of the tradition. The narrator, having quarrelled with the other religious leaders, finds refuge in Egypt ‚Äì Islamic countries having forbidden Cavism any access to their territory. He eventually discovers that his name was removed from the Cavist Scriptures which he had himself composed. Also, a woman Cavist leader named Iris, whom he had known, becomes a new manifestation of the ancient Mother Goddess ‚Äì which had earlier been manifested in The Virgin Mary and before that in Isis and others. This \\"Irisian\\" element becomes grafted on to Cavism, as it was earlier grafted on Christianity.

Life Born on 16 September 1791, he was son of John Martin of 112 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London. After assisting John Hatchard, bookseller in Piccadilly, he went into business on his own account in Holles Street, Cavendish Square; but soon afterwards entered into partnership with John Rodwell in New Bond Street. He retired from business in 1826, but continued bibliographical pursuits. Until 1845 Martin acted as secretary to the Artists' Benevolent Fund. In 1836 he was appointed librarian to the Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey, and settled at Froxfield, in the parish of Eversholt, nearby. He visited nearly every church in Bedfordshire, and wrote a description of each in a series of articles which appeared in the Bedford Times and Northampton Mercury. Martin died on 30 December 1855 at Froxfield, and was buried in Eversholt churchyard. He was a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Linnean Society. Works In 1834 Martin published the results of research, his Bibliographical Catalogue of Books privately printed, 2nd edit., 1854. The first edition contained an account of private presses and book clubs omitted in the second edition. He wrote also a History and Description of Woburn and its Abbey; a new edition, Woburn, 1845. The first edition was in 1831, by John Docwra Parry. At the request of Lord John Russell, Martin compiled an ‚ÄòEnquiry into the authority for a statement in Echard's History of England regarding William, lord Russell,‚Äô which was printed for private circulation in 1852, and published in 1856. It related to the fabricated Popish Plot, and the assertion that the early Whig William Russell, Lord Russell interfered to prevent the mitigation of the punishment of being hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason, in the case of Viscount Stafford, on the presentation of the petition of Sheriffs Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish to the House of Commons on 23 December 1680. Martin also furnished notes to Lord John Russell's edition of Rachel Russell, Lady Russell's Letters, 1853; and in 1855 he published a translation of Fran√ßois Guizot's essay on the Married Life of Rachel, Lady Russell. Martin edited Thomas Gray's Bard (1837), and Gray's Elegy in a Country Churchyard (1839 and 1854), with illustrations from drawings by the Hon. Mrs. John Talbot, and the Seven Ages of Shakspeare (1840 and 1848), illustrated with wood engravings. =Church descriptions= Martin's newspaper articles on Bedfordshire churches, 1845‚Äì47 and 1852‚Äì54, are reprinted, along with near contemporary notes and descriptions by Archdeacon Henry Bonney and Sir Stephen Glynne, and relevant archival records, in the following volumes:  Family Martin's wife died in 1836, and of six children, three survived him.

It is one of the four standalone clock towers in Chennai, the other three being the ones at Royapettah, Doveton and Pulianthope. History The first standalone clock tower in the city was built at Doveton Junction at Purasawalkam in the early 1900s. Before the tower was built, until the end of the 19th century, officers at Fort St. George used to fire cannonballs at 8:00 p.m. every day. This practice, however, stopped after the construction of the first standalone clock tower. Following this, a similar tower was built at Mint Junction in George Town. The clock at the tower was built by Gani and Sons, initially known as the South India Watch Company, which was started in 1909 by Haji Mirza Abdul Gani Namazi of Iranian descent. It is the company that also provided clocks for the independent clock towers at Royapettah, Choolai and Tiruvottiyur among others. The clock tower was inaugurated in 1948 by the then Mayor of Madras U. Krishna Rao. Location The clock tower is located at the Mint Junction, where Basin Bridge Road, North Wall Road, Mint Street, and Old Jail Road meet. The clock tower The clock tower remains a classic example of art deco architecture in the city. The features of the clock tower include linear model, thin lines, high use of cement concrete, rich usage of colours and fewer floral engravings. The architectural style of the clock tower was influenced by the Industrial and the French revolutions, as were the other clock towers and cinema theatres built in the city in the 1900s. The tower is 60 feet high. Each of the dials on the clock is made of aluminium and measures four feet in diameter. The clock has a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its time-keeping element and runs on weight-driven mechanism. The internal mechanism consists of six iron plates tied to a metal rope, which are connected to a chain of wheels. As the wheels rotate, they move the iron plates down, moving the brass pointer on the dial. The clock has to be manually wound using a spanner as key once every 30 hours. The clock stops working, however, once the plates hit the floor. The plates are lifted manually once a week by keying it. Renovation The clock had been defunct for several decades. In 2013, following the construction of Mint flyover at the junction, the Corporation decided to revive the clock tower. In January 2014, the Chennai Corporation and P. Orr & Sons jointly completed renovating the tower. On 17 January 2014, the clock was run on a trial basis following repairs.

In 2003 it was reported the typical range of capacity loss in lithium-ion batteries after 500 charging and discharging cycles varied from 12.4% to 24.1%, giving an average capacity loss per cycle range of 0.025‚Äì0.048% per cycle.  Stress factors  Capacity fading in Li- ion batteries occurs by a multitude of stress factors, including ambient temperature, discharge C-rate, and state of charge (SOC). Capacity loss is strongly temperature-dependent, the aging rates increase with decreasing temperature below 25 ¬∞C, while above 25 ¬∞C aging is accelerated with increasing temperature. Capacity loss is C-rate sensitive and higher C-rates lead to a faster capacity loss on a per cycle. Chemical mechanisms of degradation in a Li-ion battery dominate capacity loss at low C-rates, whereas, mechanical degradation dominates at high C-rates. Graphite/LiCoO2 battery capacity degradation is reported to be affected by mean SOC as well as the change in SOC (ŒîSOC) during the cycling operation. For the first 500 equivalent full cycles mean SOC is found to have a major effect on the capacity fade of cells as compared to ŒîSOC. However, towards the end of the testing (600~800 equivalent cycles) ŒîSOC becomes the major factor affecting the capacity loss rate of the cells.

He was Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs (1834-1837) during the July Monarchy, a peer of France (1839) and Councillor of State (1852). Early years Jean-Charles Persil was born in Condom, Gers, on 13 October 1785. His parents were Jean-Joseph Persil, a merchant and bourgeois, and Marie Denux. He was destined for the bar. He came to Paris early, studied law for one year and was received as a doctor in 1806. He published a book on mortgages in 1809, followed by one on privileges and mortgages in 1812. He considered teaching law, and competed for a chair at Grenoble and at Paris. He was admitted to the bar and he earned a solid reputation as a jurist. Under the Bourbon Restoration (1815-1830) Persil participated in the struggles of the Liberal party. He defended his friend Nicolas Bavoux before the Court of Peers. July Monarchy An 1832 cartoon depicting Persil attacking the editor of La Caricature with his huge saw-like nose Persil was elected deputy for the 2nd district of Gers (Condom) on 23 June 1830. He protested against the ordinances of Charles X of France, and supported making the Duke of Orleans Lieutenant- General of the kingdom. He concurred with the establishment of the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe I. He was appointed general counsel at the royal court of Paris. On 8 November 1830 he was reelected for the fourth district of Gers (Lombez). As deputy and magistrate Persil supported the conservatives and fought the democratic liberal party with great energy. He attacked the republican clubs and newspapers, denounced conspiracies and meted out severe punishments. He became a target of hostile cartoonists, who gave him a huge saw-shaped nose. On 4 April 1834 Persil was called by Louis Philippe to replace F√©lix Barthe as Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs. He ran again for election due to this appointment, and was returned on 15 May 1834 and then on 21 June 1834 in three districts, choosing to represent Condom. He remained minister until 22 February 1836. He was again minister from 6 September 1836 to 15 April 1837 in the first cabinet of Louis Mathieu Mol√©. He resigned when Mol√© refused to dissolve the chamber. He was made president of the committee on currency, but was forced to resign early in 1839. Persil was again elected Deputy on 4 November 1837 and on 2 March 1839. He was made a Peer of France on 7 November 1839. On 24 April 1845 he was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. Until 1848 he supported the government of Louis Philippe with his votes and speeches. Later career Maison St. Jean (or Maison Ch√©nier) After the February Revolution of 1848 Persil returned to private life. He accepted the position of Councillor of State on 31 July 1852. Persil had acquired the Maison Ch√©nier in Antony, Hauts-de-Seine, in 1820, and had enlarged it. He made it his place of retirement. He died in Antony on 10 July 1870, aged 84.

It prefers sandy soil but can withstand most types of well-drained soil. It can root easily from stem cuttings, if allowed to dry for 3‚Äì7 days before planting so that it can form a callus and not rot. It grows from 1.5 ‚Äì 3 meters. Chemistry As with many other Euphorbia species, the latex from the plant is poisonous and can cause skin irritations. It is a pest-free plant. A problem that some trigonas face is that they are susceptible to falling over when fully grown because of their shallow and small root system FLEURS TROPICALES DES JARDINS D'AFRIQUE, Miller, Euphorbia trigona, Uses The plant is only known in human cultivation and is commonly used as a house plant.

The main facilities and shipyards are located in western France, in Normandy where the allied troops landed 70 years ago. The groundbreaking products of the company rely on a brand new patented technology : amphibious motorboats featuring all-terrain tracks.  History  The shipyard was created in 2008, from the idea of Antoine Brugidou, former Vice President of Accenture, in association with the naval architect Tanguy Le Bihan and the designers (Fritsch & associ√©s).Antoine Brugidou quitte Accenture pour prendre la direction d'Iguana Yachts, 4 octobre 2011 , voilesnews, le magazine Internet de la voile. Based on the requirements of Antoine Brugidou willing to have a performant, marine and elegant boat able to walk on each and every surface, Antoine Fritsch designed the Iguana Mobility System. A very simple and efficient patented system enabling the hull to carry the mobility system. In marine conditions, the track system is perfectly integrated in the hull and deployed (90¬∞ rotation) on the ground. The special designed tracks (customized external pattern adapted to sand and mud, and internal material unaffected by corrosion), enable the boat to land on most of the surface from slopes (up to 12¬∞ angle), to sand or mud beaches or even small rocks surfaces. After three years of development, two prototypes, Iguana Yachts launched the serial production in Caen using local expertise to ensure the best quality for a high level performance and comfort. The project was funded by several business angels networks (Arts et M√©tiers Business Angels, ESSEC Business Angels, Paris Business Angels, XMP Business Angels)IGUANA YACHTS invente le bateau chenilles, 25 octobre 2012 , Connexions, portail des acteurs du d√©veloppement en Basse-Normandie. and led to the launching of the first 24 ft boat in 2012.Nautisme, Iguana, le canot amphibie, n¬∞ 3296, 30 ao√ªt 2012, L'Usine nouvelle.

The Iguana Yachts amphibious boats carry many innovations, with more than 800 parts, from the customized high resistance roller blade suspensions to the automatized control command system. The ground engine, key of the terrestrial propulsion system has been developed with major German engineers and carry marine grade aluminum and 316 stainless steel, materials adapted for an extensive marine immersion resistant to corrosion. The hulls are built from composite materials using advanced resin infusion technologies: vacuum infusion, foam core sandwich and carbon fiber, guaranteeing the best possible balance between strength and weight. Vacuum pressure is used to drive resin into the laminate. The aluminum landing gear connected to the carbon fiber hull ensures fatigue resistance and leads to the good performance of the boats. The Iguana 29 are used as tender yachts, as day boats for owners of beach villas enabling them to go directly from the garden to the water.

He served one term in the New York State Assembly in 1876, representing the 11th district.  Life  Elliot C. Cowdin was the son of Angier and Abiah (Carter) Cowdin. He born in on August 8, 1819, in Jamaica, Vermont, but grew up mainly in Boston, Massachusetts, where the family moved to after his father's death. Cowdin became involved in the silk trade in the 1840s and, in 1852, he moved to New York City to establish his own business, Elliot C. Cowdin & Company, an importing firm that specialized in \\"ribbons, silks, flowers and other Paris novelties.\\" The business had a branch office in Paris, France and Cowdin maintained a second home there. He was also active in politics; as a speaker and lecturer; and in several civic organizations, including the New York Chamber of Commerce, the New England Society of New York, the Bedford Farmers' Club, and the Union League, which he had helped to found. Cowdin married Sarah Katharine Waldron (1827-1903), the daughter of Samuel W. and Martha (Melcher) Waldron, on September 13, 1853. They had six children: Katharine W., John Elliot, Martha G., Winthrop, Alice, and Elliot. Elliot Cowdin died at his home in New York on April 12, 1880.  Political career  Cowdin held some appointed posts in government, including that of U.S. Commissioner to the Paris Expedition in 1867. He was also a member of the 100th New York State Legislature in 1876, elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican representative of the 11th District (New York County). His interests as an Assemblyman, as indicated by the bills he introduced, included government reform, taxation and finance, and trade and commerce.

Peer contagion refers to the transmission or transfer of deviant behavior from one adolescent to another. It can take many forms, including aggression, bullying, weapon carrying, disordered eating, drug use and depression. It can happen in natural settings where peer dealings occur as well as in intervention and education programs. Awareness of influence is uncommon and it is often not intentional. Rather \\"they engage in relationship behaviors that satisfy immediate needs for an audience or companionship\\" unintentionally. Many processes of peer contagion have been suggested, including deviancy training.  Deviancy training  In the context of deviance, peer contagion attributes the \\"activity and result of youth conversations\\" to the \\"promotion of deviant behavior\\" typical of \\"youth that are in peer groups who have little structure or supervision\\"  Other possible avenues  Social learning theorists suggest that peer contagion happens after the observation of deviant behavior amid social reinforcement. Normative socialization is the process by which adolescents try to remove dissimilarities between themselves and other youth. Friendship selection is the process of youth choosing deviant peer groups because of shared interests. Some researchers claim that one dynamic of peer contagion may precede adolescent friendships. Adolescents may adopt behaviors with the expectation that this will lead to friendship or acceptance in a peer group. Evidence also exists that adolescents seek out peer groups based on mood and that connecting with a group with a similar mood will tend to intensify it. Peer groups also tend to feed off of themselves, without member awareness, pressuring members to become more homogeneous over time, through the reinforcement of verbal expressions, particularly involving a response of laughter.Utah Criminal Justice Center .

The act became law during the 113th United States Congress. During the same congress, the Senate considered S. 1302, a bill with same name but different provisions. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act would amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to cooperative and small employer charity pension plans (CSEC plans), to: (1) define such plans as employee benefit pension plans that are defined benefit plans maintained as of June 25, 2010, by multiple employers, all of whom are tax-exempt charitable organizations; (2) exempt CSEC plans from existing funding standards and allow such plans to establish minimum funding standards and special rules with respect to the valuation of plan assets, required contributions, and liquidity requirements; (3) allow pension plan sponsors to elect out of treatment of their plans as a CSEC plan in plan years beginning after December 31, 2013; and (4) require notices to pension plan participants to include statements that different rules apply to CSEC plans than apply to single-employer plans, that contributions to a plan may have changed due to amendments made by this Act, and that a CSEC Plan is in funding restoration status for the plan year. The bill would require the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate established by ERISA to make itself available to assist CSEC plan sponsors and participants. Procedural history The Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 18, 2014 by Rep. Susan Brooks (R-IN) and Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) . The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce and the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. The House was scheduled to consider the bill under a suspension of the rules on March 24, 2014. On March 24, 2014, the House passed the bill with a voice vote. On March 25, 2014, the United States Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent and President Barack Obama signed the bill into law () on April 7, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Brooks argued that the bill was needed because \\"some charities, schools and cooperatives are actually shutting down summer camps, cutting back on services to the community, or raising prices just to meet their pension obligations.\\" According to Jo Ann Emerson, the CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, \\"both the House and Senate have now confirmed that cooperative and non-profit pension plans pose virtually no risk of default and deserve different treatment.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Acts of the 113th United States Congress Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4275 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4275 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4275 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4275 *House Republicans Conference's Legislative Digest on H.R. 4275 *Full Statement from Susan Brooks on passage Category:United States federal taxation legislation Category:Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act"},{"id":"42297549","text":"Tiago Rodrigues de Leifert (born May 22, 1980) is a Brazilian journalist and television presenter.

Its published mission is to ‚Äúchampion the sustainability of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve (The Preserve) for the benefit of this and future generations. As stewards, we connect the community to the Preserve through education, research, advocacy, partnerships and safe, respectful access.‚Äù The McDowell Sonoran Preserve is the largest urban preserve in the U.S. (List of urban parks by size), located within the city limits of Scottsdale, Arizona. It encompasses more than of upper Sonoran Desert, including large portions of the McDowell Mountains. The McDowell Sonoran Conservancy, in partnership with the City of Scottsdale, provides for stewardship of the land within the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. A small paid staff works with volunteers, known as stewards, from the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy to assist the city staff. These services and activities include a volunteer stewardship program (see below), scientific and historical research, advocacy, and other activities that promote the use, protection, and enhancement of the Preserve. History In 1990, with the combined population of the nearby communities of Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, Rio Verde and Carefree approaching 150,000, housing and commercial developments were beginning to encroach upon the McDowell Mountains. Local citizens who for years enjoyed unobstructed mountain views and unfettered recreation within the mountain range increasingly came to the realization that the mountains were unprotected.Fudala, Joan. Historic Scottsdale: A Life from the Land. Chapter VII. Historical Publishing Network, 2001. Pages 83-93, 2014. On November 17, 1990, thirteen concerned preservationists and outdoor enthusiasts met at Scottsdale's Mustang Library to discuss preservation of the McDowell Mountains and adjacent Sonoran Desert lands. On January 21, 1991, the group incorporated as the McDowell Sonoran Land Conservancy, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of the McDowell Mountain area. Signers of the incorporation documents were Jane Rau and Karen Bertiger. The McDowell Sonoran Land Conservancy initially did business using the name McDowell Sonoran Land Trust (MSLT). In August 2005, it adopted a new dba name: McDowell Sonoran Conservancy. The MSLT board quickly realized that a reliance on private donations would not provide effective funding for the purchase and preservation of sufficiently large parcels of land. The board decided to turn to the citizens of Scottsdale for support. In 1992, they approached the Scottsdale city council with a request to develop a preservation plan for the McDowell Mountains and surrounding Sonoran Desert lands. The council created a task force to study preservation the following year. During this same period, MSLT directors began leading informal educational hikes into the future Preserve and writing numerous articles for local periodicals in order to build support among influential citizens. The initiatives of 1992 and 1993 bore fruit in 1994, when the city council, acting on task force recommendations, created a permanent McDowell Sonoran Preserve Commission (Preserve Commission), and endorsed a plan to acquire 25 square miles of land. Public support came the following year when 64% of Scottsdale's voters approved a 0.2% sales tax to fund land acquisition. Land desired for the McDowell Sonoran Preserve was selected based on: ‚Ä¢ Access potential ‚Ä¢ Unique geological, historical and archeological features ‚Ä¢ Ecosystem and wildlife habitat ‚Ä¢ Scenic quality ‚Ä¢ The potential for appropriate passive public use (i.e. hiking, biking, rock climbing, equestrian); and ‚Ä¢ Corridors connecting natural open space areas In 1998, the city's Preserve Commission recommended expanding the target size of the Preserve to 57 square miles. Mindful of public concern regarding maintenance expenses associated with a large preserve, the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy developed the concept of Preserve Stewardship, created a formal steward educational program, and graduated the first steward class. The stewardship concept as a partnership with city staff was purpose-built for the Scottsdale environment and remains a unique model among land trusts in the United States. Its value was particularly demonstrated in 2002 and 2005, when the Preserve was closed for weeks at a time due to fire danger, with stewards patrolling the Preserve perimeter and educating the public. As Scottsdale continued to acquire private and state land for preservation, it became obvious that additional funds would be needed to complete the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. To that end, a city initiative was proposed and passed in 2004 to increase the sales tax by 0.15%, providing a total Preserve-dedicated tax of 0.35%. The passage of the increased tax was unusual at the time as the general attitude in the state favored tax reductions. Two bond issues supporting the creation of the Preserve were also passed, in 1996 and 1999, each with a voter approval exceeding 70%. Acquisition of land for the proposed boundaries of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve is within 4,000 acres of completion. Currently, over 500 specially-trained stewards support Preserve operations. The McDowell Sonoran Preserve Scottsdale's McDowell Sonoran Preserve is a permanently protected 30,000-acre sustainable Sonoran Desert habitat open for non- motorized trail use. The Preserve provides critical refuge for native plants and animals living near urban environments. The Preserve connects in the north with the three-million-acre Tonto National Forest and in the southeast with the 21,000 acre McDowell Mountain Regional Park, providing an uninterrupted wildlife corridor. Geologically, the Preserve is diverse. The southern portion, consisting mainly of the McDowell Mountain range, is largely composed of erosion-resistant metamorphic rocks formed about 1.7 billion years ago.Skotnicki, Steven J. Geologic Map of the Fountain Hills/Mount McDowell Area, Maricopa County, Arizona. Arizona Geological Survey Open-File Report 95-16. Partially funded by the Arizona Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey, STATEMAP program. October, 1995. By contrast, the northeastern and southeastern corners of the McDowell Mountains are composed of granite. An unusual feature of the northern Preserve is the appearance of geologically young (15 to 25 million years old) volcanic deposits from the nearby Superstition Mountains. Humans have inhabited and used the lands within the Preserve for about 7,000 years. The Archaic people (5,000 BCE ‚Äì 500 CE) and the Hohokam (100 CE ‚Äì 1450 CE) established many seasonal and temporary sites.Phillips, Steven J. and Comus, Patricia W., Editors. A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert. Arizona-Sonoran Desert Museum and University of California Press, 2000. Pg. 107. The McDowell Sonoran Preserve currently offers approximately 120 miles of non-motorized, multi-use trails (hike/bike/horse) accessed from multiple trailheads. The Preserve's temperature ranges from 17 ¬∞F to 118 ¬∞F, with an average annual rainfall of 8.7 inches. Elevation ranges from 1,690 feet to 4,059 feet. The Preserve is open every day between sunrise and sunset. Dogs on leashes are welcome. Smoking, alcohol and fires are prohibited within the Preserve.Tluczek, Melanie, Editor, The Flora and Fauna of Scottsdale's McDowell Sonoran Preserve; Published by the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy, 2014. Public/Private Partnership The Preserve is maintained by a public-private partnership between Scottsdale and the Conservancy. Historically, Scottsdale took the lead on acquiring land for the Preserve and works with the Conservancy on stewardship and maintenance of the land. The McDowell Sonoran Conservancy provides a number of services to Scottsdale for the benefit of the Preserve, particularly staff and volunteers to support Scottsdale in the work of protecting, promoting and managing the Preserve. Between 1998 and 2013, Conservancy-trained volunteers contributed more than 270,000 hours of services. The relationship between Scottsdale and the Conservancy was formalized in December 2011 in an Agreement (Contract No. 2011-101-COS) regarding the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. In the Agreement, the Conservancy, as authorized by Scottsdale, agreed to provide staff and trained volunteers to assist Scottsdale in operations, maintenance, and outreach-related services and activities in or directly related to the Preserve. These services and activities include a comprehensive volunteer stewardship program (including patrol, maintenance, trailhead hosting, and education); facilitating scientific research; website and printing resources; and advertising, promotion, special events, and membership activities for the sole purpose of promoting the use, protection, and enhancement of the Preserve. In turn, Scottsdale agreed to provide on-site supervision, tools and materials, training or training design, authorization, fee reservations, direction and materials, reporting forms and permit formats, and use of the City's facilities. On no less than an annual basis, Scottsdale and the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy meet to discuss existing Conservancy Preserve-related services and activities, and to jointly plan for the coming year. Conservancy staff prepares and presents a report to Scottsdale annually, setting forth its activities in the preceding year and its plan for the coming year. Advocacy The McDowell Sonoran Conservancy obtains funding for its activities from individual gifts, foundation grants, donations from corporate partners, legacy gifts provided through wills and trusts, and gifts of land and stock. Partner Conservancy members and supporters logged almost 39,000 hours of volunteer labor in fiscal year 2013. McDowell Sonoran Conservancy Volunteer Functions Within the Conservancy there are 10 volunteer programs in which stewards can participate: 1\\\\. Citizen Science: Protecting the Preserve is an interdisciplinary challenge, balancing the threats with the opportunities that coexist at the boundaries separating the urban from the desert environments. Citizen-scientist stewards support monitoring and assessment of the natural and historic resources in the Preserve, and share this information through educational talks and programs. 2\\\\. Community Relations: Through pictures and words, volunteers deepen the personal connection between people and the Preserve. Those who connect to the land are more inclined to support community efforts to protect land resources. Community Relations volunteers convey the story of the Preserve to the public through a variety of programs, including a quarterly newsmagazine (Mountain Lines), community articles, photography, speaker's bureau and outreach at community events. 3\\\\. Construction and Maintenance: Volunteers maintain existing trails, help build new trails, conduct land restoration, maintain trailheads, remove non-native plants, and perform any other work that helps to maintain a healthy Preserve ecology and safe access for visitors to the Preserve. 4\\\\. Education: Steward education programs provide volunteers with continuing education opportunities, both in a classroom setting and online. Volunteers develop and teach courses on natural history, which include flora, fauna, geology, human history, and ethnobotany. Public education programs are also periodically offered. 5\\\\. Fundraising: Since the Conservancy is a non- profit 501(c)3 entity, fundraising assists in funding operations and building long-term financial stability. Volunteers help to identify individuals and organizations that may wish to donate to help the Conservancy meet its financial obligations and so carry out its strategic goals. 6\\\\. Hike: Public- guided hikes by trained stewards ensure that Preserve visitors have a knowledgeable hike leader to take them to beautiful and interesting areas of the Preserve. The hike leaders often discuss information about the best hiking techniques, map reading, GPS technology, flora and fauna, safe desert hiking skills, and stewardship. 7\\\\. Nature Guides: Volunteers within Nature Guides provide opportunities for the community to learn about the value, significance and wonder of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve, through interactive tours and trailside learning. These stewards foster a sense of ownership and stewardship in the community, as well as an appreciation of the natural and cultural resources of the Preserve. 8\\\\. Pathfinders: Volunteer Pathfinders serve as hosts at the various trailheads within the Preserve. They welcome visitors with information about the Preserve, including trail maps, ecology and conservation value. Pathfinders help each visitor have a safe and enjoyable experience. 9\\\\. Patrol: Patrol stewards monitor hundreds of miles of trails on foot, horseback or mountain bike. They assess trail conditions for both safety and sustainability and provide reports that help Scottsdale and Conservancy staff to properly manage the Preserve. 10\\\\. Volunteer support: This program plans events to recognize and celebrate the collective efforts of the steward community. The volunteer mentor program provides a liaison process to enable new stewards to learn from established stewards within the organization. McDowell Sonoran Field Institute The McDowell Sonoran Field Institute (MSFI) is the research center of the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy. Its mission is to study the environment of the Preserve as well as the human history and human impacts. It does this by partnering with scientistsCurrent or former Principal Investigators include Prof. Ronald L. Rutowski (Arizona State University), Dr. Stevan Earl (Arizona State University), Brian Gootee (Arizona Geological Survey), Steve Jones (independent botanist), Dr. Helen Rowe (Arizona State University), Dave Weber (North American Field Herping Association), and others. (known as Principal Investigators or PIs) and actively involving volunteers in research as citizen scientists. Research results are used for long-term resource management, education, and to contribute to the broader scientific knowledge of natural areas. Research in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve using this model started in 2008 when a group of volunteers recruited Brian Gootee of the Arizona Geological Survey (AZGS) to assist them with an informal investigation of the geology in a small area of the Preserve. This work culminated in the publication of two papersArizona Geological Survey CR-09-B: Limestone Discovery in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve; and Arizona Geological Survey CR-10-E: Preliminary Geologic Survey of the Lost Dog Overlook Vicinity, McDowell Sonoran Preserve, Scottsdale, Arizona. through AZGS in 2010, one of which was the first paper submitted with non-geologists as the principal authors.The contributed report is the product of a team of non-geologists ‚Äì volunteers of the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy ‚Äì working under the tutelage of a professional geoscientist. As such, it exemplifies a ‚ÄòCitizen Science‚Äô contribution to the geology of Arizona. (Editor‚Äôs Note to CR-10-E by Dr. Michael Conway, Arizona Geological Survey) An anonymous-donor contribution in 2009 and a three-year grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust in 2010 were used to formally establish MSFI and hire a staff leader. In 2013, the Citizen-Science program was initiated as a volunteer program of the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy, led and managed by volunteers under staff supervision. The Citizen-Science program offers specialized training for volunteers interested in participating in MSFI research projects with the Principal Investigators. Citizen-Science program volunteers do field work, data entry, basic analysis, mapping, and other tasks under staff or scientific supervision. MSFI has published reports summarizing its work-to-date developing baseline surveys of Preserve flora, fauna, and geology. Current projects focus on various aspects of human impact, including the effect of trail traffic on physical trail characteristics and nearby vegetation, the impact of development along the wildland-urban interface, and monitoring restoration sites to assess alternative approaches. All the baseline and human impact research data will be incorporated into an Ecological Resource Plan for the Preserve to assist Scottsdale in making resource management decisions.

Thott 143 2¬∫) is a 12th-century illuminated manuscript psalter, made in England. It may have been created for the education of the boy king, King Canute VI of Denmark. This manuscript is known for the many artists who contributed to the full-page illuminations. The Copenhagen Psalter is currently in Denmark.  History  = Origin = This royal psalter was made in the 12th century. This manuscript was created under the influence of the Austin Canons, also known as the Augustinians, in a time of papal schism. Furthermore, the manuscript has Augustinian elements in its calendar which was made in Northern England. The manuscript was probably made in Lincoln. Because the list of saints in the manuscript does not include Thomas Becket, who was canonized in 1173, it is likely that the manuscript was executed before this year. Several artists seem to have been involved in the making of the manuscript, one of whom has been identified as the so-called Simon master, who also worked for Abbot Simon of St Albans. Until recently, the Psalter was thought to have been made for an English royal patron, even though obital notices in the calendar indicate that the book belonged to the Danish royal family in the 13th century. This person who it was intended for must have been very young, due to the fact that the Pater noster, which is the Lords Prayer, is preceded by an alphabet, indicating that the book was to be used as a primer. Much seems to indicate that the book was made for King Canute VI of Denmark, and commissioned by Bishop Eskil of Lund who was actually one of the artists. The bishop was in France between 1158 and 1168, where he met an artist who seems to subsequently traveled to England and oversaw the creation of this psalter in Lincoln. When Eskil returned to Denmark in 1168, he was commissioned with preparing celebrations in 1170 for the upcoming coronation of the seven year old Canute as co-ruler with his father, King Valdemar the Great (reigned 1157‚Äì82), and for the canonization of Saint Canute. Perhaps because it was made for a boy king, just seven years old, the Copenhagen Psalter includes an alphabet, and aside from its religious use, could be used to teach the young king to read. Christopher de Hamel in 2016 also remarked that although the illumination is in the English manner, it could have been executed (perhaps by an English team) either in Paris or even in Denmark. The evidence is inconclusive. = Sister Manuscript = The Copenhagen Psalter has a sister manuscript, called the Hunterian Psalter (also referred to as the York Psalter in earlier literature). This psalter has the same stylistic features as the Copenhagen Psalter, but different iconography. It was also most likely made for another member of the Danish royal house. Although there is uncertainty about who it was for, it has been suggested that it was made for Roger de Mowbray, a crusader and religious benefactor known to have founded a number of Augustinian and Cistercian monasteries and nunneries.  Description  = Illuminations = The Annunciation to the Shepherds The Copenhagen Psalter begins with a calendar and a set of full-page miniatures illustrating the life of Christ. The manuscript also contains 166 illuminated initials. This book has a calendar that shows various English feasts. Saint Oswald, who was given the highest level of veneration who as a patron of the Augustinian Order. Within the psalter there are a number of illuminated initials, a cycle of full page illuminations. These pages consist of scenes from the life of Christ such as Birth, Crucifixion and Resurrection.The pictures shown in this manuscript are only half of the sequence and most likely, it had more than eight leaves with 16 Old Testament pictures. One of the first illuminations shown is the Annunciation where the angel Gabriel greets the Virgin Mary and a dove that is the Holy Spirit. Gabriel and Mary both hold scrolls inscribed in Latin.NativityOn the other side of the same manuscript leaf (the verso), the Nativity itself is illustrated. The Virgin is recovering after giving birth in the foreground and the Christ Child, swaddled, with a red halo, lies in the manger in the background, admired by the animals in the stable. Both Mary and Joseph look to Jesus, the focal point of the image. Another illumination is the Annunciation to the Shepherds, with an angel coming down from heaven proclaiming Christ‚Äôs birth to three startled shepherds. Again, the angel holds a scroll in Latin. Although the text of a manuscript is important, the illuminations are just as they tell the narrative. These illuminations are filled with vibrant colors. They are bold, rich, and contain dark colors like red, blues, and green. Not only do the colors show the thoughtfulness in design, but there are patterns within the boarders. The patterns are vine- like, spiral, and other organic designs. = Text and Script = Inside of the manuscript, the writing is almost certain to have been written by an English scribe. There are characteristics trailing-topped \\"a\\", \\"g\\" not quite closed in its lower loop with an ampersand. The calendar inside of the Psalter shows the English ancestry; it is written in black in but some of the calligraphy is in red, blue, or green. = Materials = It has 199 leaves, is made of parchment and measures 28.6 centimetres (11.3 in) x 19.8 centimetres (7.8 in). The calligraphy and the illuminations are of the very highest quality. Five or six English artists participated in painting its exquisite miniatures of the Life of Christ and 166 historiated and decorated initials. Within this manuscript around the opening initial there are seven large gold stars within the stars are jewels. As the manuscript shows sophistication by using gold and jewels, it shows throughout the manuscript in the recurring images of kings.  References  * De Hamel, Christopher.

A portion of an unstable hill collapsed, sending mud and debris to the south across the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, engulfing a rural neighborhood, and covering an area of approximately . Forty-three people were killed and 49 homes and other structures destroyed. Overview 2009 view to the southwest overlooking the slide site (on the left) and the Steelhead Haven plat across the Stillaguamish River. The unstable area is the area of lighter green trees to the right and beneath the river section that is visible. The mudslide flowed towards the upper left, across the river. All of the houses visible in the image were destroyed. The March 2014 landslide engulfed 49 homes and other structures in an unincorporated neighborhood known as \\"Steelhead Haven\\" on the south side of the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, approximately east of Oso, Washington. It also dammed the river, causing extensive flooding upstream as well as blocking State Route 530, the main route to the town of Darrington (population 1,347), east of Oso. The natural rock and mineral formation (referred to by geologists as a \\"geological feature\\") with the most recent activity in the area of Oso is known as the Hazel Landslide; the most recent landslide event was referred to in the media as \\"the Oso mudslide.\\"; ; ; . Excluding landslides caused by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes or dam collapses, the Oso slide is the deadliest single landslide event in United States history. The Hazel Landslide has a history of instability dating to 1937.; . ; . Prior to the March 2014 mudslide, the Oso area had heavy rainfall during the previous 45 days, up to 200 percent of normal.. The slide, described by witnesses as a \\"fast-moving wall of mud,\\" contained trees and other debris; it cut through homes directly beneath the hill on the south side of the Stillaguamish River. A firefighter at the scene stated, \\"When the slide hit the river, it was like a tsunami\\". A Washington state geologist stated the slide was one of the largest landslides he had personally seen. The mud, soil and rock debris left from the mudslide covered an area long, wide and deposited debris deep.Tina Patel, \\"The mud and debris are 70 feet deep in some places\\", Q13 Fox News * Fresh landslide tailings depicted in aerial photograph dated 2006, with topology map comparisons (1901‚Äì1977), NETROnline.com. * . * . * A national geologist stated the flow of the landslide was extreme because of the extraordinary run-out of mud and debris. While the landslide was well documented, a research team from the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) announced in April 2014 that it would investigate the factors contributing to the slide. Casualties and damage More than 100 first responders from Snohomish County and other surrounding counties were dispatched to assist with emergency medical and search-and-rescue efforts, including the Navy's search and rescue unit stationed at nearby Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.; ; ; ; . Over 600 personnel, including more than 160 volunteers, worked on landslide recovery operations. Late in the evening of March 22, 2014, Washington's Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen declared a state of emergency in Snohomish County. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee toured the area by air the following day before joining county officials at a news conference. On the day of the slide, eight people were rescued and taken to regional hospitals. While the official search for victims ended in April 2014, workers and volunteers continued to screen debris and look for one victim still unaccounted for. On July 22, 2014 the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office confirmed 43 fatalities after remains of the final victim had been located and identified.MyNorthwest.com; Last body found in Washington mudslide ‚Äì July 22, 2014, 1:16 pm The slide blocked the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing it to back up eastward. Because of concerns that the mud and debris dam could fail and cause downstream flooding, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a flash flood watch. On April 2, 2014, with the river flowing in a new channel at the north end of the debris dam, the service lifted the flash flood watch. Flooding due to the partially obstructed river continued to occur upstream of the debris dam. As a result, the NWS continued to issue flood warnings for the Stillaguamish one month after the March 2014 slide.National Weather Service Watches, Warnings & Advisories; Flood Statement National Weather Service, Seattle, WA 327 PM PDT Sat Apr 19 2014 State Route 530 was indefinitely closed after the slide by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), with an alternative local route opened the following week after snow was cleared from the unpaved portion of Mountain Loop Highway south of Darrington. The highway was cleared enough by May 31 to open one lane of escorted traffic. Because the highway was badly damaged, and because the topography of the area had been altered by the landslide, WSDOT decided to elevate that section of the highway when it was rebuilt. As of July 27, the first of four stages in rebuilding the highway had been completed. The new roadway was opened September 22, ahead of schedule of the projected completion date of early October 2014. Federal aid On April 3, the mudslide was declared a major disaster by President Barack Obama. The declaration was requested on April 1 by Governor Inslee, who stated that approximately 30 families needed help with housing and other needs. Inslee said that financial loss estimates had reached $10 million. Snohomish County Emergency Management Director John Pennington advised residents to register with FEMA.\\"Obama declares major disaster for Oso landslide\\" , KING 5 News and Associated Press via KVUE, April 3, 2014. Retrieved April 3, 2014. Four days later, during passage of the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) mentioned the landslide, saying the bill would \\"provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area.\\" On April 22, President Obama visited the west side of the slide area. After arriving in Air Force One at Paine Field in Everett, he met with officials and boarded Marine One. There, he was joined by Governor Inslee and Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell as well as Rep. Suzan DelBene for a flyover of the slide and debris field. After viewing the site, the president met privately with survivors, families of the victims, and some of the scene's first responders and rescuers at the Oso fire hall.  Controversy  = \\"Completely unforeseen\\" = Top view of slide area On March 24, two days after the slide, John Pennington, Director of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, stated at a news conference, \\"This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere.\\". The same day The Seattle Times published an article. about previous slides at the same location, as well as the likelihood of future slides. The article contained comments from geologists, engineers, and local residents, and stated that the area was known among locals as \\"Slide Hill\\". On the next day, The Times followed up with a full page article, \\"'Unforeseen' risk of slide? Warnings go back decades.\\" Snohomish County Public Works Director Steve Thomsen was quoted as saying, \\"A slide of this magnitude is very difficult to predict. There was no indication, no indication at all.\\" Aerial view of slide ridge On March 27, 2014, The Seattle Times reported. that a 2010 study, commissioned by the county, warned the hillside above Steelhead Drive was one of the most dangerous in the county. According to Rob Flaner, one of the authors of the 2010 report, \\"For someone to say that this plan did not warn that this was a risk is a falsity.\\" In the days following the slide, criticism of Snohomish County officials received national attention in a New York Times editorial.. The Seattle Times further reported that in 2004, county officials became concerned about the possibility of a dangerous landslide in the Steelhead Haven area, and considered buying out the homes of that area's residents. The idea was rejected with the county building a new wall in an attempt to stabilize the slope. Some disaster experts criticized this decision as a serious mistake. According to environmental engineer and applied geomorphologist Tracy Drury, \\"[after the 2006 slide they] didn't even stop pounding nails.\\" As to any kind of buy-out program, Drury further stated, \\"I think we did the best we could under the constraints that nobody wanted to sell their property and move elsewhere.\\" Repairs to the slide area extend back several decades prior to the March 2014 slide. A rock revetment installed in 1962 to protect the toe of the slide area from erosion from the river was overrun by a slide two years later. An effort in 2006 to move the river 430 feet (130 m) south of the erosion area failed when another landslide moved the river a total of 730feet (220m). . = Logging = In the days following the slide, scientists questioned whether logging in the area could have been a factor contributing to the hillside collapse.UPI Science News; \\"Logging may have contributed to deadly Washington landslide\\" Grandy Lake Forest Associates of Mount Vernon, WashingtonConcern Over Landslide- Logging Connection Near Oso Is Decades Old proposed a 15-acre (6 ha) clearcut at the upper edge of the Oso landslide zone in 2004. Washington state forester Aaron Everett stated in an interview with KUOW that the application was rejected and \\"The one that was approved in the end eliminated the part of the harvest that would have been inside the groundwater recharge area.\\" Everett further stated the resulting 7-acre (2.8 ha) clearcut operation reached to the edge of the groundwater danger zone. An investigation is being conducted to determine whether Grandy Lake crossed into the restricted area that could theoretically feed groundwater into the landslide zone, affecting it for 16 to 27 years.  Aftermath  Two years after the mudslide, about 11,000 tons of wreckage had been removed from the slide area. Thirty-four parcels of land had been purchased by Snohomish county from owners of property too dangerous for residences. Properties in the area bordering State Route 530 and across from the slide area remained salable. In October 2016, survivors and the victims' families reached settlements with the State of Washington and a timber company, Grandy Lake Forest Associates, for $50 million and $10 million respectively.  Site memorials  Alongside State Route 530, the entrance to what was Steelhead Drive is closed by a gate that was decorated by impromptu memorials. Alongside, three rows of 43 cedar trees were planted, one for each of the victims. At the time of the planting, each tree was decorated with mementos specific to each person. In September 2017, one of the few trees in the path of the slide that remained standing near Highway 530 and was seen by locals as a memorial, was cut down as a danger tree. County officials decided to cut the Sitka spruce tree down after it was determined its roots had sustained enough damage that it could no longer be considered stable and not a hazard to both the Whitehorse Trail parallel to the highway as well as the highway itself. Following the slide, a memorial sign carved out of cedar and reading, \\"Oso. 10:45 a.m. 3/22/14\\", was placed on the spruce and remained until the tree was removed. The Snohomish County Department of Parks, Recreation & Tourism announced on March 22, 2018 that plans had begun for a permanent memorial commemorating the victims. The tribute is set to be built at the location of the slide and fundraising efforts are underway with wood from the formerly standing memorial tree to be repurposed and used for the permanent display.  Ground activity surrounding the slide  Aerial view of the damage Ground vibrations generated by the Oso landslide were recorded at several regional stations and subsequently analyzed by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN). The initial collapse began at 10:37:22 a.m. local time (PDT; 17:37:22 UTC), lasting approximately 2.5 minutes. Debris loosened by initial collapse is believed to contain material previously disturbed and weakened by the 2006 slide. Following the initial event was another large slide occurring at 10:41:53 PDT. Additional events, most likely smaller landslides breaking off the head scarp, continued for several hours. The last notable signal came at 14:10:15.. Examination of records from the nearest seismic station to the southwest indicate small seismic events started around 8 a.m. the day of the slide and stopped in the late afternoon. However, they were not detected at the next nearest seismic station. They are also seen in the days before and after the slide, but only during daylight hours. They are believed to be related to some kind of human activity. No other indications of possible precursors have been found. In the days following the slide, Snohomish County Emergency Management Director John Pennington speculated a 1.1 magnitude earthquake on March 10 may have triggered the landslide.; . Data collected by the PNSN shows a magnitude 1.1 earthquake on that date in the vicinity of the Oso landslide (about 2 ¬±0.8 km to the northeast), at a depth of 3.9 ¬±1.9 km. (PNSN).M1.1 ‚Äì 18km WNW of Darrington, Washington (BETA) Regardless, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) determined the slide was not caused by seismic activity.USGS states slide not caused by seismic activity Geological context Shaded-relief geomorphologic map of Oso Landslide of 2014 and adjacent areas.

Terrace on the upper-left is Whitman Bench. Image from . The landslide occurred at the southeastern edge of Whitman Bench, a land terrace about above the valley floor and consisting of gravel and sand deposited during the most recent glaciation.; . When the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet moved south from British Columbia, Canada filling the Puget Lowland, various mountain valleys were dammed and lakes were formed. (Sauk River Quadrangle). Sediment washed down from the higher mountains settled in the lake bottoms, forming a layer of clay. As the glacial ice pressed higher against the western end of Mount Frailey, water flowing around the edge of the ice from the north was forced around the mountain, eventually pouring in through the long valley extending to the northwest and now occupied by Lake Cavanaugh. Sand and gravel carried by the flow and entering the glacial lake dropped out to form a delta, the remnant of which is now known as Whitman Bench.The areas predominantly containing gravel and sand are shown as \\"Qgoge\\" and \\"Qgose\\", respectively. \\"Qgle\\" and \\"Qglv\\" mark exposures of the underlying clay and silt with \\"Qls\\" marking landslide complexes. ; (DDMF). Following the glacier's retreat and allowing for the lake to be released, the river carved out most of the clay and silt deposits, leaving the former delta \\"hanging\\" approximately above the current valley floor. When the sand portion of a deposit has very little clay or \\"fines\\" to cement it together, it is structurally weak, leaving the area around it vulnerable. Such an area is also sensitive to water accumulation, increasing the internal \\"pore\\" pressure and subsequently contributing to ground failure. Water infiltrating from the surface will flow through the surface, save for contact with the less permeable clay, allowing the water to accumulate and form a zone of stability weakness.. Such variations in pore pressure and water flux are one of the primary factors leading to slope failure. In case of the area of the Stillaguamish River where the March 2014 slide occurred, erosion at the base of the slope from the river flow further contributes to slope instability.. Such conditions have created an extensive series of landslide complexes on both sides of the Stillaguamish valley. Additional benches on the margin of Whitman Bench are due to deep-seated slumping of large blocks, which also creates planes of weakness for future slippage and channels for water infiltration..  History of slide activity  According to a 1999 report submitted to the United States Army Corps of Engineers. by geologist Daniel J. Miller, PhD:Geologist Daniel J. Miller Ph.D. curriculum vitae online > The Hazel landslide has been active for over half a century. Thorsen (1996) > noted a tight river bend impinging on the north bank with active landslides > visible in 1937 aerial photographs. The next 60 years involves two periods > of relatively low landslide activity, and two periods of relatively high > activity, the last of which extends to this day [1999]. Known activity at this specific site includes the following:. * 1937: aerial photographs show active landslides. * 1951: mudflow from a side channel briefly blocked the river. * 1952: movement of large, intact blocks, leaving head scarps high. Later photographs show persistent activity through the next decade. * 1967 January: slump of a large block and accompanying mud flows push the river channel about south. This protects the toe from erosion, activity is minor for about two decades. * 1988 November: erosion of the toe leads to another slide, and the river is again moved south, but not as far as in 1967. * 2006 January 25: large slide blocks the river, new channel is cut to alleviate flooding..

Biography Born on 1 May 1776, Campbell was the son of a British Army officer. Early career In 1797, Campbell purchased his first commission in the Army as an ensign with a regiment stationed in the Turks and Caicos Islands. In 1799, Campbell purchased a lieutenancy. In 1800, Campbell returned to England and joined a regiment of light troops there. From February 1802 to September 1803, he attended the Royal Military College, then located at Great Marlow. After his time at the college, Campbell became an assistant quartermaster-general. In 1805, Campbell purchased a promotion to major in a regiment that spent two years in Jamaica. After returning to England, Campbell purchased a promotion to lieutenant colonel. Over the next three years, Campbell participated in the campaigns to capture Martinique, the √éles des Saintes, and Guadeloupe from the French. War in Europe Campbell returned to Britain in 1810 and in 1811 was seconded as a colonel in the Portuguese infantry, a post he held until 1813. In that year he was sent as a British military attach√© to accompany the Russian Army. He was with the Russians when they invaded France in 1814. Campbell actively participated in fighting the French. He was severely wounded on 25 March 1814 while leading a cavalry charge during the Battle of F√®re- Champenoise when a Russian Cossack mistook him for a French officer. Later in 1814, Campbell became a full colonel and in 1815 received a knighthood. Exile of Napoleon and Waterloo After the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, Campbell was tasked with escorting him into exile on the Island of Elba and then heading the military detachment there. Lord Castlereagh, Great Britain's foreign minister, had insisted that Napoleon be given complete freedom on the island. On 26 February 1815, while Campbell was in Italy, Napoleon escaped Elba. There were suspicions in England that Napoleon had bribed Campbell to allow his escape, but the foreign ministry did not fault Campbell in any way. In 1815 Campbell served in the Waterloo Campaign and served as a commander of occupation forces in France until 1818. Sierra Leone Campbell was promoted to Major General in 1825 and was now able to apply for a staff appointment. The first opportunity was as governor of Sierra Leone. Due to the health hazards in that colony, Campbell's family asked him to turn down the assignment. However, Campbell decided to go. On 14 August 1827, Campbell died of an unknown disease in Sierra Leone and was buried in Circular Road Cemetery.

It was last assigned to the Air Corps Advanced Flying School, and was disbanded on 1 October 1931 at Kelly Field, Texas. While active, the wing served as the headquarters for the Air Corps' three groups training aircrew, which were located in Texas and California. The 24th School Wing is not related to the United States Air Force 24th Special Operations Wing, which was established on 19 November 1942. History The 24th School Wing was organized at Kelly Field, Texas in 1927 to command the flying training units of the Air Corps. Air Corps Flying Schools were located in the San Antonio, Texas area at Kelly Field and at Brooks Field and at March Field near Riverside, California.Clay In 1922, the Air Corps had reorganized the method it used for pilot training, with Brooks Field, Texas becoming the center for primary training and Kelly Field, Texas the center for advanced training. By 1927, three training squadrons had been set up at Brooks and five at Kelly. With the beginning of the five-year expansion program of the Air Corps in 1926, it was found that the existing facilities in the San Antonio area would be insufficient to support the expansion, and a third training group would need to be established at March Field, a former World War I training field which had been closed in 1922. With a third group of four squadrons at March, a wing was needed as an intermediate level of command to avoid having too many units being assigned directly to school Headquarters at Kelly Field.ManningMaurer Upon activation at Kelly Field, the wing transferred personnel from the 10th School Group. In the late 1920s, the growth of the City of San Antonio created hazards for pilot training. In June 1927 General Frank Lahm suggested the construction of a single large field outside of the city to house all flying training. Congress funded the new field's construction but not the purchase of the land, so the city of San Antonio borrowed the $546,000 needed to purchase the site selected for what became Randolph Field. By the fall of 1931, construction was essentially completed at the new facility, so the Air Corps Training Center at Kelly Field and the primary schools at Brooks and March moved to the new installation. With the opening of facilities at Randolph, the school at March Field was closed and March became a tactical flying field. The 24th School Wing was disbanded on 1 October 1931 and its subordinate units were absorbed into the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Randolph Field and the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field.

Taxonomy The species was first named in 1900 as Demeusea longifolia by √âmile De Wildeman & Th√©ophile Durand. In 1952, it was transferred to the genus Haemanthus by Hamilton Traub. Scadoxus had been separated from Haemanthus by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1838, when he moved Haemanthus multiflorus to Scadoxus multiflorus. This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when Scadoxus was again segregated from Haemanthus by Ib Friis and Inger Nordal. Haemanthus species are southern in distribution, form true bulbs and have 2n = 16 chromosomes, whereas Scadoxus species, such as S. longifolius, are found throughout tropical Africa, do not all form bulbs and have 2n = 18 chromosomes.

He lived in London and Glasgow. He came back in Italy in 1940 due to the Second World War. He fought in France and he got imprisoned in Monza in 1943, bound to a German concentration camp, but he managed to escape and run away from Italy to Switzerland as a refugee.

Sala, Carlo Martini, Leonardo - De Luca editori, 1991.A. M. Comanducci, Dizionario illustrato dei pittori, disegnatori e incisori italiani moderni e contemporanei, volume III, Patuzzi, 1972. Artistic style During his academic growth, Martini's style was influenced by Novecento Italiano, and then by Chiarismo Lombardo movement. The English period (1938-1940) gave him the possibility to assimilate the impressionistic lesson and the art of painters as William Turner and John Constable. Several paintings of that period represent the English and Scottish countryside. The artistic maturity brought new pictorial trials, where children and Italian landscapes carved out a leading role in his canvases, showing the artist's love and attachment for his daily inner life.E.

It faces Birmingham Children's Hospital. The 1933 station itself, in neo-Georgian style is not a listed building, but the adjacent, late-nineteenth century cell block on the corner of Coleridge Passage was given Grade II protection on 8 July 1982 for its special architectural interest: the three-story building has a brick and terra cotta facade with many ornaments, and it has a slate roof. The station sits in Birmingham City Council's Steelhouse Lane conservation area, which was designated in October 1993. A tunnel links the cell block to the courts. The City of Birmingham Orchestra, (later renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) held its first rehearsal in the band room at the old station, at 9.30am on 4 September 1920. For around sixty years, until closed in 2005, the station housed a private bar, allowing officers to drink when not on duty. The police station closed for the final time on Sunday 15 January 2017.

In 1893 the club was elected to the Football League, and the first League match at Clifton Grove was played on 9 September 1893, with Rotherham defeating Grimsby Town in front of 3,000 spectators. This was also the highest League attendance recorded at the ground, and was equalled on 1 September 1894 for a 3‚Äì1 defeat by Burton Wanderers. In 1896 the club was voted out of the Football League and subsequently folded. The last League game at Clifton Grove was played on 16 March 1896 with just 300 watching a 2‚Äì2 draw against Lincoln City. After the club folded, the ground was subsequently used for housing.

Introduced a year before the Colt Open Top (a model from 1872) and two years before the Colt Peacemaker and the Colt New Line (both introduced in 1873), the Colt Open Top Pocket Model Revolver was, alongside the Colt House Revolver, one of the two first metallic cartridge rear-loading revolvers manufactured by Colt's. It also was one of the first pocket metallic cartridge revolvers made by the company.  History and design  When the Rollin White patent for metallic cartridges firearms manufacture expired (c. 1870) the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company started working on its own metallic cartridge revolvers (Colt had previously been manufacturing the so- called Richards-Mason conversions). Thus, Colt introduced its first rear- loaders in 1871: the Colt House/Cloverleaf and the Colt Open Top Pocket Model Revolver. In the 1870s the firearms market was awash with cheaply made knockoffs of the .22 caliber Smith & Wesson Model One which sold for about $2. Colt's president Richard Jarvis decided it would not compete directly with the knockoffs; that its .22 would be of Colt quality. The Open Top Pocket was priced at $8. The frame was brass and sometimes silver or nickel plated. The barrel and cylinder were either blue or nickel plated. Rosewood or walnut grips on a bird's head style frame made for a comfortable pistol to shoot. Loading was accomplished via a groove in the frame rearward of the cylinder and early models incorporated an ejector rod until 1874. After that, a shooter would need to remove the cylinder to empty the brass casings. Cheap copies imported from Spain and Belgium drove down the demand for these revolvers and Colt stopped manufacturing them by 1877.  Calibers  The Open Top Pocket Model was chambered in .22 Short and .22 Long, both using black powder as the propellant. It was equipped with a 7-shot non-fluted cylinder and two different barrel lengths: 2-3/8‚Ä≥ and 2-7/8‚Ä≥. NOTE: It is highly questionable that modern .22 ammunition would be safe to use in antique firearms.

It grows to a maximum length of about ; females are usually smaller than males. Description Spicara smaris grows to a maximum length of but a more common maximum size is . It is a more slender fish than the closely related blotched picarel (Spicara maena) and can be distinguished from that species by having 75‚Äì81 scales along the lateral line rather than 68‚Äì70. Its back is grey-brown and it has silvery flanks with a large black spot located above the tip of the pectoral fin. Male fish are usually larger than females and have small blue spots scattered across the dorsal and anal fins. Distribution and habitat Spicara smaris is native to the subtropical eastern Atlantic Ocean including the coasts of Portugal, the Canary Islands and Morocco, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It is usually found in seagrass meadows and over sandy and muddy seabeds. Its depth range is generally but it has been recorded at depths of in the eastern Ionian Sea. Biology Spicara smaris is a sociable fish, forming large groups with others of its species. It is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite, individuals maturing as females and becoming males at some later point. All individuals over about are male and the maximum age for a male is six years while for a female it is four. Breeding takes place once a year and the colour of a male becomes brighter at this time. The male will scoop out a nest in soft sediment in which the female will lay eggs. The male then guards these until they hatch, after which time his bright colours fade and he rejoins other schooling fish. Classification Spicara smaris was removed from the family Centracanthidae and placed in family Sparidae in 2014.

The first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was one of the projects undertaken by the Knight family after they bought large parts of Exmoor in the early 19th century. Frederick Knight (MP) took over from his father in trying to exploit the mineral assets of the land. Several adits were driven into the rock and a shaft dug. It was a copper mine from 1845‚Äì54, although no copper was extracted, despite samples showing 60% metallic ore. It was then examined by Henry Schneider, of Schneider Hannay & Co which became the Barrow Hematite Steel Company, during 1856-57 for iron although none was found. The mine was soon abandoned and allowed to flood. In 1858 the area became notorious for the murder of a seven-year-old girl, Anna Burgess. On the death of her mother she moved with her father, William Burgess, into lodgings in Simonsbath. His older children went into domestic service. Burgess was supported by The Reverend W. H. Thornton (1830-1916) who was the first vicar of Exmoor. The parson raised money to support Burgess, but this was spent on alcohol. In June 1858 he left his lodgings with his daughter, telling the landlady that he was taking her to live with her grandmother in Porlock Weir. Some burnt clothes were found which had belonged to Anna and the Rev Thornton investigated in Porlock Weir finding that the girl had not been taken there. Thornton instigated a search and rode to Curry Rivel to fetch the nearest police officer. The searchers had found a recently dug grave, however it did not contain the girl's body. Burgess had escaped by boat to Swansea but was found and brought back to Somerset, where he was imprisoned in Dulverton. He said nothing about the whereabouts of his daughter and searches of the local moors continued for two months. A witness then said he had seen Burgess near the Wheal Eliza Mine. Local magistrates ordered the mine to be drained which took several months and cost ¬£350. Once the water had been pumped away a bag was found containing the child's body. Burgess was found guilty of murder and before being hanged admitted that he had killed her so that he could spend the 2s 6d a week intended for her welfare on drink. He was taken to the gaol in Taunton and hanged on 4 January 1859. Little remains of the original buildings but the pit for the waterwheel and parts of the shaft head with a rising main and pump rod are still at the site. There are also platforms and the footings of several buildings.

It is a bulbous plant from South Africa (east Cape Province, KwaZulu-Natal). The smallest of the species of Scadoxus, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant where a minimum temperature of can be maintained. Description Scadoxus membranaceus is the smallest of the species in the genus Scadoxus. It grows from a bulb from which three or four thin leaves appear. The leaf stalk (petiole) is long and the leaf blade long. The flowers are borne in an umbel about across on the end of a leafless stem (scape). Bracts underneath the umbel (usually four) enclose it, more or less to the same height as the tips of the flowers. The bracts, which are usually coloured, persist throughout flowering and fruiting. Individual flowers are described as being green, pink or pale red in colour. The tepals are fused at the base forming a tube about a third of the length of the flower. The stamens and style are slightly longer than the flowers and so protrude. The ripe berries have been described as \\"especially showy\\". Taxonomy Scadoxus membranaceus was first named by John Gilbert Baker in 1888 as Haemanthus membranaceus. He later described it a variety of Haemanthus puniceus (now Scadoxus puniceus). Baker did not explain the origin of the specific epithet membranaceus. Its usual botanical meaning is \\"thin, film-like, flexible\\". He did describe the leaves as \\"very thin in texture\\", the only feature described in this way. Scadoxus had been separated from Haemanthus by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1838, when he moved Haemanthus multiflorus to Scadoxus multiflorus. This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when Scadoxus was again segregated from Haemanthus by Ib Friis and Inger Nordal. Haemanthus species form true bulbs and have 2n = 16 chromosomes, whereas Scadoxus species do not all form bulbs and have 2n = 18 chromosomes. Haemanthus species are all native to southern Africa, whereas most Scadoxus species are found in tropical Africa, although this is not true of S. membranaceus which is from eastern South Africa. =Relationships= Scadoxus membranaceus is very similar in many respects to Scadoxus puniceus. The two species were shown to be closely related in phylogenetic analyses based on morphological features carried out by Nordal and Duncan. They differ in only three of the 25 characters used in the study: S. membranaceus lacks a pseudostem, S. puniceus has one; S. membranaceus has exactly four bracts below the umbel, S. puniceus has more than four; S. membranaceus has pedicels less than 1 cm long, S. puniceus has pedicels more than 1 cm long. Distribution and habitat Scadoxus membranaceus is native to the east coast of South Africa, from the east of Cape Province in the south to KwaZulu-Natal in the north. It grows in areas of coastal sand, and on rocks as a lithophyte where there is sufficient accumulated material to form an open rooting medium. Cultivation Scadoxus membranaceus is not common in cultivation, but can be grown with a minimum temperature of , such as provided by a heated greenhouse in less favourable climates. An open growing medium is required, such as that used for orchids. Propagation is by seed. Pests are those of Scadoxus generally. Toxicity The genus Scadoxus is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous alkaloids. These are lethal to animals, such as sheep and goats, that graze on the plants. Other species of Scadoxus have been used in parts of tropical Africa as components of arrow poisons and fishing poisons.

She was used to ferry workers across the harbour to vessels under repair during the Second World War. Erg was sunk in the Halifax Harbour three times and is currently located in the Bedford Basin. Early service Erg was originally a steam tug called Sambro and was built by the Halifax Shipyard in 1915. She was one of the earliest steel vessels to be built in Halifax. Sambro was 55 feet long and almost 15 feet wide, with a depth of 7 feet and her maximum tonnage was 28. The tug was originally sunk during the Halifax Explosion of 1917. In 1927, Sambro was raised out of the harbour and was converted from steam to diesel, being given a 4 horsepower engine. With this change, the tug was given a new name and a new purpose. The vessel was renamed Erg and was used as a transport tug, ferrying workers and their equipment from the shipyard to vessels under repair. Wartime harbour Halifax Harbour was an extremely busy port during the Second World War. Because of this, navigational dangers increased with the congestion in the harbour. The Naval Service of Canada, which kept records of the activity in the harbour, advised that from 1940 to 1943, there were at least 12 vessels involved in accidents within Halifax Harbour. Vessels such as Camperdown, Claire Lilley and Nueva Indalucia ran aground, whereas others such as Otter, and Trongate caught fire and sank (or, in the case of Trongate, was made to sink as the flames were completely out of control). In 1940, Herbidean was sunk by the British ship Esmond; a forerunner to the fate of Erg.Tucker, Gilbert Norman (1952). The Naval Service of Canada: Its Official History: Volume II: Activities on Shore During The Second World War. Ottawa: King's Printer. Wreck On June 6, 1943, Erg was carrying workers and equipment (air compressors and electric generators) through the fog and rain, when she was run down by a Norwegian freighter ‚Äì a steamship named Norelg (See Convoy SC 94 for more information on this ship). The tug immediately began sinking and as a result, 19 men lost their lives. On July 19, the Royal Canadian Navy utilized the floating crane Lord Kitchener to raise the wreck of Erg so the bodies of the deceased could be recovered. Only 10 bodies were discovered and removed from the wreck. Ergs sinking was and still is considered one of the worst accidents to have taken place in the Halifax Harbour and is the greatest loss of life in regards to a shipwreck within these waters. Upon inspection, it was decided that Erg was beyond repair and on August 24, 1943, she was taken to her final resting place and sunk for the third and final time. Final resting place The Erg shipwreck site was rediscovered in 2001 in the northern part of the Bedford Basin (near Roach Cove) by the Nova Scotia Exploration Society. The site is a protected heritage site and is visited by many divers. Objects which were recovered from Erg, such as the ships' whistle and portholes are currently on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic on Lower Water Street.

Its red to pink flowers face downwards as the top of the flowering stem bends over, unlike any of the other species of Scadoxus. It grows mainly as an epiphyte in tropical mountain forests, which are disappearing, making the species vulnerable to extinction. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Description Scadoxus nutans grows from a rhizome, with growth occurring mainly in spring and autumn. The whole plant is usually tall, occasionally as high as . The overlapping bases of the leaf stalks (petioles) form a false stem or pseudostem, which emerges from the side of last year's pseudostem. The pseudostem is green, marked with brown spots, and is about long. The narrow leaf blades have wavy edges and spread out from the pseudostem, being up to long and wide. The flowers are borne on a leafless stalk (scape), which is bent over during flowering so that the flowers face downwards. no other species of Scadoxus has similarly nodding flowers. The umbel of 2‚Äì30 flowers has a dense brush-like appearance and is surrounded by a number of bracts, which persist until fruiting occurs. Individual flowers are carried on short stems (pedicels), less than long, and have red to pink tepals, fused at the base for about with narrow free segments up to long. When the flowers fade and fruits are formed, the scape straightens, so that the ripe red berries, about long, are held upright. The sticky seeds are elongated, about long and wide. All other species of Scadoxus have ovoid or spherical seeds. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1971 by Ib Friis and Inger Bj√∏rnstad, being initially placed in the genus Haemanthus. In 1976, the same two authors (the latter under a different surname) transferred the species to Scadoxus as part of their segregation of the two genera. The specific epithet nutans refers to the nodding umbel of flowers. Distribution and habitat Scadoxus nutans is an Ethiopian endemic. It is found in the Kaffa and Illubabor regions in the southwest of the country. It occurs only in evergreen mountain forests, between and in elevation. Although occasionally found growing on the ground, it grows mainly as an epiphyte, with no apparent preference for the host species of tree. Conservation Scadoxus nutans is described as \\"vulnerable\\" as the mountain forest on which it depends is continually being lost through changes of land use. The Ethiopian Tree Fund Foundation (ETFF) is endeavouring to maintain and restore native forest by working with local farmers. Cultivation Scadoxus nutans can be cultivated where the necessary temperature can be maintained in the winter (at least ). In a pot it requires a very open, coarse organic growing medium. Jonathan Hutchinson, the UK National Plant Collection holder for Scadoxus, recommends the addition of lumps of tree fern stem. Pests are those of Scadoxus generally. Toxicity The genus Scadoxus is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous alkaloids. These are lethal to animals, such as sheep and goats, that graze on the plants. Other species of Scadoxus have been used in parts of tropical Africa as components of arrow poisons and fishing poisons.

The Orland Fire Protection District covers Orland Township, the Village of Orland Park, the Village of Orland Hills, unincorporated areas of Orland Township, and parts of Tinley Park. Hickey was first elected to serve a six year term on the OFPD in 2009 as a trustee, and was elected as the board's president in 2010. As the new president of the board, Hickey and the board cut the District's budget by more than $2 million during the first year Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended St Adrian Grammar School, St. Laurence High School, DePaul University (BA Liberal Arts), and graduated from Benedictine University with an MBA and concentrations in Finance & Accounting. He's the director of business development (real estate) for Peace Village, a senior citizens community in Palos Park, but before that was a partner in a mortgage and real estate business. Hickey grew up on the Southwest Side of Chicago in St. Adrian Parish near 71st Street and Western Avenue \\"where my parents and grandparents had lived.\\" Hickey has also run several times for public elective office including in the Democratic Primary election for the new 11th Congressional District in 2012, which was won by Democrat and incumbent Congressman Bill Foster. The 11th District includes the municipalities of Joliet, Aurora, Naperville, Burr Ridge, Woodridge, Darien, Bolingbrook and Plainfield, but does not include Orland Park or the OFPD. During his election, he proposed eliminating the interest paid by students on government loans to college students as a means of assisting college students. In December 2013, he announced his intention to run for the United States Congress in the 2nd Congressional District, the seat formerly held by former Congressman Jesse Jackson, but later withdrew. Hickey also was a surprise candidate for a seat on the Cook county Board in the 17th District to challenge three-term incumbent Cook County Commissioner Elizabeth Doody Gorman. But Hickey, a Democrat, and Gorman, a Republican commissioner and GOP Committeeman of Orland Township, are political allies. Hickey was unchallenged in the March 18, 2014 Democratic Primary and is the Democratic nominee for the November 4, 2014 general election. Hickey said he entered the race for the 17th District Cook County Board believing that Gorman, his ally who was a key supporter in Hickey's election, was planning to run for higher office and that he would only seek Gorman's seat in the November 4, 2014 Illinois general election if she retired.

Having been sent to Exeter grammar school, he matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in the autumn of 1581. Martyn was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1589, and from 1605 to 1617 held the office of recorder of Exeter. On 7 April 1617 he died at Exeter, and was buried in St. Petrock's Church on 12 April, with an inscription placed to his memory. Works Martyn was the author of The Historie and Lives of the Kings of England from William the Conqveror vnto the end of the Raigne of Henrie the Eight, 1615, containing preliminary verses from his three sons and his son-in- law, and an appendix of \\"succession of dukes and earles\\" and other particulars.

It was only discovered for science in 1960. Similar in many respects to the more widely grown Scadoxus multiflorus, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant. Description Scadoxus pole-evansii has a similar growth habit to Scadoxus multiflorus subsp. katherinae, growing from a bulb with attached rhizomes. The bases of the leaves are grouped to form a false stem or pseudostem. Plants may be tall. The flowers are borne in the form of an umbel on an upright leafless stalk (scape). The bracts under the umbels turn downwards and are generally withered during flowering. Individual flowers have salmon-pink to vermilion tepals, fused at the base to form a short tube, and with broad, spreading free segments at the end, each generally with five veins. The fruits are berries, red to orange in colour. Taxonomy The species was first discovered for science in 1960 by Reginald John Pole-Evans, growing in the Nyanga area of east Zimbabwe. It was formally described by Anna Amelia Obermeyer in 1963, as Haemanthus pole-evansii. Scadoxus had been separated from Haemanthus by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1838, when he moved Haemanthus multiflorus to Scadoxus multiflorus. This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when Scadoxus was again segregated from Haemanthus by Ib Friis and Inger Nordal, and Haemanthus pole-evansii was transferred to Scadoxus pole-evansii. =Relationships= Scadoxus pole-evansii is very similar in many respects to Scadoxus multiflorus. The two species were shown to be closely related in phylogenetic analyses based on morphological features carried out by Nordal and Duncan. One of the few differences is that the tepals of S. pole-evansii have broader free segments, generally with five veins, whereas those of S. multiflorus are narrower, more lanceolate, and generally have only three veins. Distribution and habitat Scadoxus pole-evansii is endemic to the Nyanga region of east Zimbabwe. It grows in afromontane forest at in soil which is very open and humus-rich. Cultivation Material of Scadoxus pole- evansii was sent to England at the time of its discovery. It first flowered there in January 1963, at the RHS Garden, Wisley. The species was given the RHS Award of Merit in July 1969. In cultivation it requires similar conditions to the other tropical species of Scadoxus with a minimum temperature of or more and an open, humus-rich growing medium. In the northern hemisphere it begins to grow in the summer, continues throughout the winter, and becomes dormant in the early spring. Pests are those of Scadoxus generally.

He sat in the House of Commons in the Irish Parliament of 1585‚Äì6, and briefly held office as Chief Justice of Munster and as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer. He profited from jis close family association with the Earl of Ormond (who was himself a favourite of Elizabeth I, being her cousin through her mother Anne Boleyn). Comerford rose rapidly in the public service to become a trusted servant of the English Crown, and would probably have become the dominant political figure in the south-east of Ireland had it not been for his early death.Clavin, Terry \\"Gerard Comerford\\" Dictionary of Irish Biography Dublin Royal Irish Academy 2009 pp.711‚Äì713 Background He was born at Callan, County Kilkenny, the second son of Fouke (also called Fulco or Fulke) Comerford and his wife Rosina Rothe.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.312 His father was in the service of the Earl of Ormonde, acting as both his lawyer and his land agent.Carrigan, William History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory Vol.3 Dublin Sealy Bryers and Walker 1905 pp.230,306 The Comerford family seem to have originated in Waterford: an earlier Fouke Comerford was Mayor of Waterford in 1433, and again in 1448. From the 1530s onwards the family became substantial landowners in County Kilkenny, although they suffered serious damage to their property during the Desmond Rebellions. In 1569 it was reported that \\"old Fulco Comerford of Callan\\" had been robbed of ¬£2000 (a considerable fortune at the time), together with silver, household goods, corn and cattle.Carrigan p.306 Early career Gerald went to school at Kilkenny College. Like many younger sons of laded families in that era, he decided on a legal career and entered the Middle Temple in 1578.Ball p.312 In the closing stages of the Second Desmond Rebellion, he was asked by the Crown to negotiate with the rebels, but in attempting to arrange a parley he was attacked and severely wounded. On his return to England he petitioned Elizabeth I successfully for a pension for his services to the Crown and was given leave to retire to Ireland to regain his health.Ball p.312 He entered the King's Inns and rose quickly at the Irish Bar through the patronage of Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, to whom he was always close. In 1584 he was appointed Attorney General for the province of Connacht.Ball p.312 Politics His political career advanced rapidly, and in the Irish Parliament of 1585‚Äì6 he was returned as one of the two members for the newly created borough of Callan.Ball p.312 His career suffered a brief setback in 1587, owing to his hostility to Sir John Perrot, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. Comerford was a member of the faction who worked for the downfall of the Lord Deputy, and he was briefly imprisoned on this account.Ball p.312 In 1588, after Perrot's recall to England, he earned the goodwill of Sir Richard Bingham, the Lord President of Connaught, and was appointed a member of his Council. In 1588, following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Comerford was given the task of tracking and reporting on the movement of the surviving ships as they made their way down the west coast of Ireland. He was a highly conscientious official: Bingham later paid tribute to his fifteen years unpaid work as Attorney General. In 1591 he visited the English Court, where he was praised for his fidelity to the Queen and appointed Attorney General of Connacht for life.Ball p.312 In the same year his old enemy Perrot was convicted of high treason and died in the Tower of London while under sentence of death. During the Nine Years War the Crown lost control of Connacht, but Comerford showed his devotion to duty by remaining in the provincial capital, Galway. He relied for his safety on the protection of loyalist peers, such as Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, and in 1597 he reported on the disturbed state of the province. He was given an armed guard, but complained that he was obliged to pay the guards out of his own pocket. In 1599 he went to Ennis and reported back to the Crown on the unsettled conditions he found there.Ball p.312 Career in Munster In 1600, perhaps as a result of his frequent complaints that he had been poorly rewarded for his fifteen years of loyal service to the Crown, he was appointed to the Council of the Lord President of Munster, and was also appointed second justice of the President's court.Ball p.312 During the final stages of the Nine Years War, the ordinary courts of common law ceased to operate in Munster, and the President's court took over all judicial business in the province. Comerford was present at the Battle of Kinsale, and though he did not have much of a reputation as a soldier, he is said to have fought against Hugh O'Neill. He sat on the court which tried William Meade, the former Recorder of Cork, for treason in 1603; despite strong pressure from the judges, the jury found Meade not guilty, and were severely punished for contempt of court as a result.O'Brien, C.V History of Cork 1861 Vol.2 p. 1 Last honours and death In 1604 he was appointed Chief Justice of Munster, and contrary to the normal practice by which the Chief Justice was expected to refuse any other judicial office, he was also made a Baron of the Irish Court of Exchequer;It had previously been understood that the office of Chief Justice of Munster was so onerous that the office holder should not seek to combine it with a seat on the High Court bench he died, at Coolnamuck in County Waterford, in November of that year, still well under 50 years of age. He had inherited the family estates from his elder brother and added substantially to them. His principal residence was Castleinch (or Inchiologhan) in County Kilkenny, which had previously belonged to the de Valle family: the Comerfords remained there till the 1650s. He was buried at St. Mary's Church, Callan, where the impressive tomb erected in his memory can still be seen.Ball p.312 St. Mary's Church, Callan, where Gerard Comerford is buried. Family He married Johanna Walsh, daughter of James Walsh, Mayor of Waterford, and sister of his judicial colleague Sir Nicholas Walsh; she outlived him. According to his will they had six children, Fouke, Nicholas, Edward, James, Patrick and Mary. Fouke inherited the family estates and died in 1623, leaving issue.Carrigan p,231 James became a Jesuit, which may have fuelled the rumours that his father was a secret Catholic. Mary reached a considerable age, and was still living in 1644, but is not known to have married.Carrigan p.231 Religion In religion he was to all appearances a zealous Protestant, who was willing to enforce strictly the laws against recusancy, even where friends and relatives were concerned. He issued a proclamation denouncing several Catholic priests, including the prominent Jesuit James Archer (a Kilkenny man whom he must have known personally) as \\"seditious traitors\\". It was of course expected of any office-holder in Elizabethan Ireland that he would conform publicly to the Church of Ireland, but as the career of Comerford's judicial colleague Sir John Everard (who married a Comerford) shows, those men who were genuinely devoted to the Roman Catholic faith found it impossible in the long term to retain office in violation of their beliefs. Rumours that Comerford (like his brother-in-law Sir Nicholas Walsh) converted to Catholicism on his deathbed seem to have no solid basis in fact, although at least one of his sons was a priest.Carrigan p.231 The rumour in both cases seems to have originated with David Rothe, Bishop of Ossory, who was admittedly a cousin of Comerford, and knew him personally.Clavin p.713 References Category:1604 deaths Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:People from Callan, County Kilkenny Category:People educated at Kilkenny College Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Kilkenny constituencies Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Irish MPs 1585‚Äì1586 Category:Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Chief Justices of Munster ","title":"Gerald Comerford"},{"id":"42298241","text":"Caleb Van \\"Tex\\" Warrington Jr. (March 21, 1921 ‚Äì September 21, 1993) was a professional American football player for the All-America Football Conference's Brooklyn Dodgers.

Governor Clay currently lives in the Burgundy region of France. Life and career Governor Clay was born on 7 July 1945, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. His mother came from a long line of Southerners whose origins were Irish, while his father was the son of immigrants from Budapest, Hungary. The family settled in Kansas when he was five years old. He appeared in plays that his father staged, and his mother taught him to play the piano. In 1965 he worked for a month laying pipes in Fort Worth, Texas, and then moved on to California. Governor Clay stayed five years in San Francisco. He set out to become a songwriter and learned his craft at the Fillmore Auditorium, in various ‚Äòpainted lady‚Äô houses, and in Golden Gate Park. Ramblin‚Äô Jack Elliott, among many others, had a profound effect on him. He also encountered the poet James Koller, and the anarchist Samuel Quick Spencer. In 1970 he moved to Denver and spent a year working on a small stage at the Columbia Tavern, where the clientele favored country western music. It was during this time that Governor Clay began to perform his own songs. He went to Paris, France, in 1972, invited to join Bruce Barthol's band. Nothing came of the project, but he did make his first recordings, working after hours at a studio in Pigalle. Governor Clay travelled back and forth between Europe and America for the next twenty years, doing his show in festivals and theaters. He finally settled in France, and began working with American singers who were touring in Europe, such as Wanda Jackson, Doug Kershaw and Mike Greene. He met Steve Lacy onstage in Switzerland, and they performed together in Sardinia. He often travels with James Koller,On Koller and Governor Clay, cf.

Similar in many respects to Scadoxus cinnabarinus, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant but has proved reluctant to flower. Description Scadoxus pseudocaulus was shown to be closely related to Scadoxus cinnabarinus in a 1984 cladistic analysis based on morphological features. It is one of the group of Scadoxus species that grows from rhizomes alone rather than also having bulbs. It differs from Scadoxus cinnabarinus mainly in having a pseudostem ‚Äì a false stems produced by the tightly wrapped bases of the leaf stalks (petioles). Another difference is that the free segments at the ends of the tepals (the basal parts of the tepals being fused into a tube) are narrower, with usually only three veins instead of five.

He has been the Legal and Technical Secretary for President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner since 2003. Zannini has been described as ‚Äúone of Kirchner‚Äôs most trusted men‚Äù and as ‚Äúthe power behind the President.‚Äù It has been said that his key attribute is his ability ‚Äúto interpret the decisions of Cristina Kirchner‚Äù and to take ‚Äúthe political decisions of N√©stor and Cristina Kirchner throughout the ‚Äòwinning decade‚Äô and translated them into decrees, resolutions, and bills.‚Äù He is nicknamed ‚ÄúEl Chino‚Äù (The Chinese) because of ‚Äúhis admiration during his youth for the policies of Mao Tse-tung in the People's Republic of China.‚Äù Early life Zannini was born in the small town of Villa Nueva, in eastern C√≥rdoba Province. His father was a bricklayer and his mother was a housewife. In his childhood he was a serious tennis player. He began to be active in politics in the 1970s, with the rise to power of Campora and the third presidency of Juan Per√≥n. He considered himself a Maoist and belonged to a Maoist group called the Communist Vanguard. After the 1976 coup because of his membership in the Communist Vanguard, Zannini was arrested and held in the prison of La Plata for four years. Eventually he was released and completed law school. In 1982, Zannini organized ‚Äúthe Peronist boys‚Äù in El Carmen. He was invited by a friend, Roberto Arizmendi, to move to R√≠o Gallegos. There he met N√©stor Kirchner in 1984, who was then an emerging politician and lawyer, and Cristina Fern√°ndez. Political career Zannini held various positions within the civil service, mostly in the province of Santa Cruz, and invariably at the right hand of Kirchner. In 1987 he was appointed Secretary of Municipal Government in Rio Gallegos. When Kirchner was elected governor in 1991, Zannini was appointed Minister of the Interior of the province. When Cristina Fern√°ndez resigned from the provincial legislature to join the National Congress, Zannini was elected to replace her. In 1999 he was appointed by Kirchner as president of the Superior Court of Santa Cruz. He has been described as the ‚Äúarchitect of two constitutional reforms in the Patagonian province,‚Äù one of which, in 1994, enabled N√©stor Kirchner to run for a second term as governor of Santa Cruz, and the second of which, in 1998, established term limits and eliminated the consanguinity clause. He also implemented the ‚Äúvoting system that assures the ruling party an overwhelming majority in the provincial legislature.‚Äù One source states that his greatest achievement was a 1995 law expanding the Provincial Court from three to five members, giving Kirchner an \\"automatic majority.\\" On 25 May 2003 Zannini was appointed the Legal and Technical Secretary of the Presidency of Argentina by President N√©stor Kirchner. He was confirmed in this position in 2007 and 2011 by President Cristina Fern√°ndez. His office is ‚Äúon the ground floor of the State House, behind the Patio de las Palmeras.‚Äù He ‚Äúhas a direct relationship with the president of the Supreme Court of Justice Ricardo Lorenzetti,‚Äù and this friendship has been key to the progress of judicial reform in the national legislature. =Relationship to the Kirchners= Zannini has been described as having been a Kirchnerite from the very beginning and as having ‚Äúnever left‚Äù the fold. ‚ÄúFirst at the local level of Rio Gallegos, then in the provincial government and finally as president,‚Äù writes one source, ‚ÄúNestor Kirchner was always flanked by Zannini, the man who drafted speeches, decrees, bills and, above all, telling him where and when or not to sign it.‚Äù Zannini has told both Kirchners ‚Äúwhat to veto, whom to appoint to key positions,‚Äù and so on. Nothing happens in the government ‚Äúwithout his permission and supervision.‚Äù He was described in October 2013 as ‚Äúthe strong man, the real power behind the scenes,‚Äù the ‚Äúpower in the shadows,‚Äù the \\"juridical architect of Kirchnerism,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most powerful functionary in the government.‚Äù It has been surmised that his strength lies not in his influence on the President‚Äôs decisions but in his ability to interpret the President‚Äôs wishes. Although it is Vice President Amado Boudou who formally replaces the president when she is ill, Zannini has been described as being the real seat of power in her absence. Buenos Aires Province Governor Daniel Scioli, the front runner in the Kirchnerist Front for Victory primary for the nomination, named Zannini as his running mate in his campaign for the 2015 presidential election. Zannini has also been described as being perhaps the one person most responsible for ‚Äúthe progress that has been made in building the Kirchner model.‚Äù He has allegedly succeeded in ‚Äúcornering power‚Äù through methods drawn from Antonio Gramsci which ‚Äúare much more effective than the armed struggle‚Äù that he and others engaged in during the 1970s. =Allegations of corruption= thumb Zannini was prosecuted in 2012 of 38 counts of illegal enrichment , fraud, and other forms of corruption . However, the case was suspended for a time and has faced several roadblocks put up by members of the presidential cabinet and government . Recently he has granted the retirement Payments back to the Ex-vicepresident Amado Bodou creating a controversial point on Alberto Fernandez government, (AB:former VP was found Guilty of all charges for corruption and misslead of National foundings as well as lie on tax form exemptions) Personal life He is the father of four children from two marriages. His first wife died in 1986, a few months after the birth of her second child. He is married to Patricia Als√∫a, an attorney with whom he had two children.

Malaysia first issued revenue stamps as the Straits Settlements in 1863, and continues to do so to this day. Over the years, a number of entities in modern Malaysia have issued revenue stamps. Straits Settlements =Receipt= The first revenue stamp issued in the Straits Settlements was an East India postage stamp overprinted S.S. in a diamond. Only about 20 copies are known to exist of this stamp, making it very rare. On 1 April 1867, the Settlements became a British Crown Colony and so Indian revenues were issued overprinted with a crown and a new value in cents. In 1874 a new issue portraying Queen Victoria, and this remained in use until the 1880s with minor changes in the perforation. =Marine Policies= Marine Policies stamps were issued in order to pay the tax on cargo insurances. A set of forty values ranging from 8c to $12 was issued, and the set included many 'obscure' values such as 37¬Ωc or $2.28 due to complicated rates resulting from conversion from pounds sterling. Most of these are very rare as they were withdrawn soon after they were issued. =Foreign Bill= In 1869, a set of Foreign Bill stamps was issued in a long vertical format, portraying Queen Victoria. Eighteen values are known, and all of these are rare. Very few were used, and only a single copy of the $12 value is known in this condition. =Judicial= The first Judicial stamps were issued in 1868. A set of twenty values ranging from 10c to $25 was issued in a similar design to the Foreign Bill issues. In 1870 a new set was issued with different colours and values up to $100, and the watermark was changed in 1874. Later revenue issues were overprinted JUDICIAL in bold letters reading up, and these were followed by a number of provisional surcharges in the 1880s. In 1890 a new set with new colours was issued, and finally a postage stamp was overprinted J and surcharged for judicial use. Judicial stamps were withdrawn in 1903. =Revenue= The first general duty revenue stamps were issued in 1874 in a design similar to Foreign Bill and Judicial stamps. Various values exist from 3c to $50. In 1882 a new design was issued in a smaller format, still portraying Queen Victoria. This design was reissued in new colours between 1888 and 1893. From the 1900s to the 1920s no revenues were issued as dual purpose postage & revenue stamps were issued. However some of the high values were intended solely for fiscal use, such as the $500 values of King Edward VII and King George V. In 1936 a stamp specifically for revenue use was issued, and in 1938 a set of three values of $25, $100 and $500 was issued portraying the new monarch King George VI. Most of these high values are very rare. =Entertainments Duty= The Straits Settlements issued three small numeral stamps inscribed Entertainments Duty Paid in the 1930s. Federated Malay States The Federated Malay States were created in 1895 and they first issued revenues around 1900. Previously the following states had their own separate issues: *Negri Sembilan (1890-1900) *Pahang (1890-1903) *Perak (1880-1900) *Selangor (1880-1902) *Sungei Ujong (1880-1893) Apart from these, the unfederated states of Johore, Kedah and Kelantan also had their own revenue issues. =Judicial= From 1900 to 1903, a number of provisional overprints were made. Postage stamps of various designs were overprinted J, Judicial or JUDICIAL or additionally surcharged. Most of these are scarce or rare, although there are common issues as well. These were replaced in 1903 with a new design showing a leaping tiger. Initially thirteen values from 3c to $50 were issued, and the high values are quite scarce. Some of these were again reissued with new watermarks in 1908 and 1925. =Revenue= Initially there were no general duty revenue issues in the Federated Malay States since dual purpose postage & revenue stamps were used for fiscal purposes. However, some of the high values denominated $25 were only intended for revenue rather than postal use. In 1910, the first stamps specifically inscribed for fiscal purposes only were issued. Two values of $100 and ¬£250 were issued in the \\"elephants\\" keytype that was already in use on postage stamps. These were later reissued with a new watermark in 1926. In the 1930s, entertainments duty stamps were issued overprinted REVENUE as well. In the 1910s, impressed duty stamps were prepared for use in the Federated Malay States. Although photographic essays and proofs exist for twelve denominations ranging from 3c to $250, no issued examples have been recorded and it is possible that these were not adopted. =Entertainments Duty= In the 1920s or early 1930s, the Federated Malay States issued five small numeral entertainments tax stamps in a design similar to those issued by the Straits Settlements. By 1936, the Federated Malay States had stopped issuing regular revenues, and Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor issued their own stamps once again. Japanese occupation Malaya was occupied by Japan following a two-month campaign in 1941-1942. During the occupation, general revenue stamps issued for use throughout Malaya, but there were also issues for individual states. The vast majority of revenue stamps issued during the occupation were overprints on pre-war revenue or postage stamps. Between 1942 and 1944, postage stamps of the Straits Settlements and various states were issued with Japanese overprints. Most of these stamps were valid for both postal and fiscal use, but some were not issued for postage and they were only used as revenues. Pictorial postage stamps issued for Japanese Malaya in 1943, as well as unoverprinted postage stamps of Japan issued in 1942‚Äì43 are known also used as revenues in Malaya. The states of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Selangor and Trengganu also issued revenue stamps (or dual-purpose postage-and-revenue stamps which were used fiscally) between 1942 and 1945. Thai occupation In 1943, the Japanese transferred control of Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu to Thailand, which administered them as Si Rat Malai. Dual-purpose postage-and-revenue stamps were issued for use throughout these four states in 1944, and some of these have been recorded with fiscal cancels. In addition, the states of Kedah (renamed as Syburi), Kelantan and Trengganu individually issued revenue stamps under Thai occupation between 1944 and 1945. British Military Administration After Malaya was liberated, the area was administered under British Military Administration. In 1945, King George VI revenues of the Straits Settlements were therefore overprinted BMA MALAYA. Federation of Malaya Initially, there were no revenue issues for the Federation of Malaya as postage stamps were used for fiscal purposes. Between 1949 and 1952, high values that were needed for fiscal purposes were issued by each of the following individual states: *Johore *Kedah *Kelantan *Malacca *Negri Sembilan *Pahang *Penang *Perak *Perlis *Selangor *Trengganu General issues were introduced around 1957 inscribed Persekutuan Tanah Melayu Hasil (Federation of Malaya Revenue). Initially three values were issued: $25, $100 and $250. These were reissued several times over the years on different paper and with slightly redrawn designs. These remained in use for years after the federation ceased to exist, as Malaysia only began to issue revenues in 1975. Malaysia =Social Security= Various stamps were issued to pay for social security between 1971 and 1973. All of them show the same design, an umbrella sheltering a worker. These were printed by various printers, so there are various changes in the watermark and paper used for the stamps. Ignoring these minor technical differences, there are twenty two different stamps with values from 10c to $10.10. =Revenue= Malaysia issued its first general duty revenue stamps in 1975, inscribed Hasil Malaysia (Revenue Malaysia) and depicting the country's coat of arms. Three values of $25, $100 and $250 were issued. In 1982, the coat of arms was changed slightly so the set was reissued with the new version. This time $500 and $1000 values were added. Further stamps were issued between 1985 and 2009, and all of them bear the country's coat of arms although they have a wide variety of designs and formats. Currently revenues are sold at the Inland Revenue department and from all post offices in Malaysia. In recent years the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia has launched a new e-stamping service to speed up processes and eliminate forgeries, however adhesive revenue stamps continue to be used. =Excise= The Royal Malaysian Customs also issues taxpaid labels to pay the tax on cigarettes.

His first theatre was Variety Hall (now Delite theatre) in Coimbatore in 1914. He was a pioneer in making movies, popular in Madras presidency and contributing to growth of it by buying new equipment from abroad, as well as establishing the concept of modern day theatres that exist today. Early Days Samikannu Vincent was born on April 18, 1883. He was born in Coimbatore. He was working in South Indian Railway as a draftsman- clerk. He happened to see some short films exhibited by French film exhibitor named DuPont. Vincent befriended him and by the time when DuPont wanted to return home, Samikannu Vincent raised enough money with difficulty to buy the Frenchman's projector, accessories and films. At the age of 22, he resigned his desk job and set up business as film exhibitor. He travelled to villages to exhibit the films he had. The film \\"Life of Jesus\\" became a huge hit in the \\"tent cinema\\" where he projected his films. Vincent usually screened his films in a tent, which was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village. The ‚Äútent cinema‚Äù concept became very popular. Family Samikannu Vincent had 4 wives with whom he had four sons and two daughters. As per his family members, vincent married 4 wives as each one died in quick succession due to illness. He was lovable father his among all children. He never took his children along for Long trips. one of his son Selvaraj, who studied both at St. Michaels in coimbatore and St. Joseph's College in Tiruchi, stopped with intermediate (Class XII now), because his father wanted them look after his business. According to his family, his father was a good magician, for which he was dubbed evil, and refused communion by the church. ‚ÄúSo, he had to perform in front of the church members, to prove that those were only tricks that came from his robe with innumerable pockets‚Äù Development Variety Hall ( Delite Theatre) Coimbatore During 1905, electric carbons were used in motion picture projector. During the same year Samikannu Vincent established his first tent cinema at Madras called Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone on Esplanade. At that time it was a novelty to watch films in this tent theatre. The electrically lit tent drew large crowds. He travelled with his tent cinema to different parts of the world like Malaysia and Singapore. Aware of the advantages of brick and mortar cinema house, he built one in his home town in 1914 called Variety Hall. Association with Cinema In 1933, Pioneer film company Calcutta and Samikannu Vincent co-produced \\"Valli\\". Since there was also a similar production was in progress in Bombay, the Calcutta version was named as Valli Thirumanam. It had T.P. Rajalakshmi playing the lead role and went on to become a huge hit. He also later co-produced \\"Sampoorna Harichandra\\" and \\"Subhadra Parinayam\\". When the historic Central Studios was inaugurated in 1935, Samikannu Vincent joined the team as one of the directors. Besides production he was also involved in equipment distribution and theatre management. He was also known for first introducing talkie equipment for his theatre in Coimbatore beating madras Other Notable Works By 1919, he established the first power-driven Rice and Flour Mill in the heart of the town. He managed all this by working as long as nine hours a day, until his sons took over. In 1922, the then Government of Madras gave him permission to supply electric power to the famous Stanes European High School. With the encouragement of Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, member of the Governor's Executive Council in charge of the Electricity portfolio, he was given enough support by the government. His application was approved and the licence to set up a power house was granted. The streets of Coimbatore and the residential buildings in the heart of the city had electric lights. Realising the need for a printing press to produce quality handbills and other materials, he promoted the printing press (around 1916) that was located in a house near his theatre. He expanded the activities of the press by installing additional machinery, types and printing accessories in another building. Called Electric Printing Works, he used the cinema house's electric power plant to run the printing press too and created history of sorts. Death Samikannu Vincent died in 22 April 1942. Association with J. P. Chandrababu Leading Comedian J. P. Chandrababu married grand daughter of Samikannu Vincent later which ended in Divorce.

It was shot by studio photographer Frank Powolny and became one of the biggest-selling photographs of World War II, selling over five million copies. This is a complete filmography of Betty Grable, an American actress, dancer, and singer. As a major contract star for 20th Century-Fox during the 1940s and 1950s, she starred in a succession of musicals and romantic comedies. Grable began her career in 1929 at age twelve, after which she was fired from a contract when it was learned she signed up under false identification. She made her film debut in Happy Days (1929) as an unbilled extra appearing in blackface. Grable had contracts with RKO Radio Pictures and Paramount Pictures during the 1930s, and she starred in roles as college students in a string of B-movies. In the campus musical Pigskin Parade (1936), she received positive reviews, but her performance was overshadowed by newcomer Judy Garland. She eventually came to prominence in the Broadway musical Du Barry Was a Lady (1939) and signed an exclusive long-term contract with 20th Century-Fox. After replacing Alice Faye in Down Argentine Way (1940), she became the studio's biggest asset throughout the following decade, starring in a series of commercially successful musicals and comedies, often co-starring with renowned leading men, including Victor Mature, Don Ameche, John Payne, Tyrone Power, and Dan Dailey. Between 1941 and 1951, she was consistently listed in the \\"Top Ten Moneymaking Stars Poll\\", sometimes as the only female on the list. In 1943 and 1944, she was the number one box office draw in the United States. Her famous 1943 pin-up became one of the most-identified photographs of World War II. The majority of Grable's films followed the traditional backstage musical point-by-point genre. Plot point one: boy meets girl; plot point two: boy teams up with girl; plot point three: girl dumps boy; and plot point four: boy and girl reunite in time for the finale. Despite the often similar storylines, her films remained immensely popularity for over a decade, some of them becoming the year's highest- grossing films, including Springtime in the Rockies (1942), Coney Island (1943), The Dolly Sisters (1945), and When My Baby Smiles at Me (1948). Two of her greatest successes were Pin Up Girl (1944) (which showcased her famous pin-up) and Mother Wore Tights (1947). The 1949 western comedy The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend was Grable's first film in nine years to lose money financially. The changing tastes of the public and the declining popularity of the musical genre in the early 1950s contributed to Grable's career decline. Although Wabash Avenue and My Blue Avenue (both 1950) were successes, some of her films thereafter failed to live up to their hype. How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), a comedy about three models scheming to marry wealthy husbands, was one of her last big successes for Fox. She co-starred with newcomer Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall, and while tabloids publicized a rivalry between the three women, they nevertheless became close friends. In 1953, she declined to renew her contract with Fox, hoping to revitalize her stage career.

Agostinelli traveled there, took measures and samples, and found that the alleged evidence of landing, called a \\"stain\\", had not been caused \\"from above\\" by \\"an object emitting heat\\", as stated in an official press release, but that the heat could have ascended from the base of the hill.\\"La mancha del Pajarillo: con pecado concebida\\".

In 1992‚Äì1993, Futuro, a section in P√°gina/12, reproduced a controversy where representatives of science spoke against and in favor of the New Age movement. The polemic began when, in an October 1992 edition, Futuro published a chapter of the book Strange Weather, by Andrew Ross, a sociologist at Princeton University. Among other things, Ross wrote that skeptic groups were \\"a symptom of the crisis in scientific rationality and materialism\\".\\"Todo sea por la buena onda\\". In P√°gina/12, October 24, 1992. By Andrew Ross. In 1996, Ross, being an editor for the journal Social Text, approved an article by physicist Alan Sokal that was actually a parody intended to reveal the lack of rigor of postmodernist philosophy.La Guerra de las Ciencias y la Tercera Cultura (FACSO, 2004). By Evaristo √Ålvarez Mu√±oz. http://www.facso.uchile.cl/publicaciones/moebio/19/alvarez.htm Agostinelli contested that Ross \\"chooses to embrace the new faces of trickery to express his disbelief in 'rationalist science'\\". The controversy took eight editions of Futuro, with many academics participating in the debate, including Alejandro Piscitelli, Marina Umaschi, Leonardo Moledo, Denise Najmanovich and Alejandro J. Borgo. The discussion continued in El Ojo Esc√©ptico articles, with opinion pieces by Celso Aldao and Manuel Comesa√±a, titular professors in the National University of Mar del Plata; Fernando Sarav√≠, associate professor of Biological Physics at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the National University of Cuyo; and CAIRP methodology consultant, Lic. Daniel De Cinti. The Roswell \\"autopsy\\". In 1995 Agostinelli denounced as a possible fraud Ray Santilli's video of an alleged autopsy of an alien from the Roswell UFO incident. Agostinelli enlisted, on behalf of La Prensa, the help of Diego Licenblat, an expert in special effects, to explain how they could have made the dummy seen in the film, and provided the idea for the program Memoria, which mounted a recreation of the fake autopsy to expose how easy, fast and cheap it was to create that footage.Noguez, Luis R.

In 2001‚Äì2002, Agostinelli produced for Zona de Investigaci√≥n (a program in Azul TV of Argentina) several controversial reports, being prominent among them the one that addressed the sexual abuse allegations against Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba.

Agostinelli describes among others the life of contactee Eustaquio Zagorski, translator to an alien language in the mid-sixties;Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 23 and reveals the biography of brothers Jorge and Napy Duclout, Argentine spiritualists who contacted a \\"talented engineer\\" who informed them about life on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, and who created the first 3D film in Argentina.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 47 The book also relates the adventures of contactee Francisco Garc√≠a, who in 1973 announced the landing in Argentina of fifty ships from Mars;Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 69. presents a profile of the Argentine flying-saucer guru Pedro Romaniuk;Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 103 and reviews the rumor disguised as news spread in 1968, according to which a \\"Vidal\\" couple had been teleported from Chascom√∫s, in Argentina, to Mexico.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 133 Invasores... reconstructs as well the \\"Peccinetti-Villegas case\\" the alleged meeting of two casino employees from Mendoza with five humanoid beings who came out of a ship with a screen, in which they showed the men apocalyptic scenes, before leaving an \\"interplanetary inscription\\" on the door and stirrups of their car. Agostinelli gets to interview both witnesses, who had not spoken of this experience since 1968.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 171 In another chapter, it tells the story of the guy who gained superpowers after eating from a barbecue made with meat from mutilated cattle, and Agostinelli proposes his own theory, based on the psychology and sociology of rumor, to explain the alleged wave of mutilation of animals registered in Argentina in 2002.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 215 This work also contains the testimony of Mr. Ra√∫l Dorado, a farmer in Jacinto Ar√°uz, La Pampa Province, whose cellphone was abducted by a UFO, and other persons related to the experience.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 265 Invaders... also addresses the secret life of Commander Clomro, a man who claimed to have been assimilated by an extraterrestrial energy. The first part is the story of a poor misunderstood alien being, the second part is that of a repentant man who tells the truth about his identity and the motives that led him to create the character.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 279 The last chapter describes the incredible story of Martha Green, the widow of a soldier enlisted in the Peronist resistance, who had since the mid-fifties a secret romance with a visitor from outer space.Alejandro Agostinelli, Invasores..., Sudamericana, 2009, p 325 External links * Ufo Press (1976‚Äì1986) * Dios! * Magia Cr√≠tica.

Blair Jr. (May 30, 1915 ‚Äì March 14, 1995) was a broadcast journalist for NBC News, perhaps best known for being the news anchor on the Today program from 1953 to 1975.  Early years  Blair was born on May 30, 1915 in Yemassee, South Carolina. His family moved to Walterboro, South Carolina, during his infancy and later moved to Charleston, South Carolina.Cox, Jim (2007).

McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 34-35. He was a Boy Scout, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout in 1930. As an adult, he was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He attended the College of Charleston prior to beginning his broadcasting career in various radio stations in South Carolina in the 1930s, leaving his pre-med studies at the college to join a theatrical touring company.  Radio  Blair's radio debut was at WCSC in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1935. Later that year, he joined WIS in Columbia, South Carolina, as a newscaster. In 1937, he became program director at WFBC in Greenville, South Carolina. Several months later, he left there to join WOL in Washington, D.C., where his job included announcing for the Mutual Broadcasting System. When NBC radio's Monitor weekend program began in 1955, Blair was one of the first news anchors.  Military service  Beginning in 1942, Blair served in the U.S. Navy as a flight instructor and transport pilot during World War II before resuming his broadcast career after the war.  Television  Blair (left) with the rest of the 1953 Today show cast, including J. Fred Muggs In 1951, Blair began his television career as the host of Heritage, an NBC cultural series broadcast live from Washington's National Gallery of Art. From 1951 to 1953, he was the moderator of Georgetown University Forum on the DuMont Television Network. Blair became the news editor and on-air newscaster for Today in 1953, continuing in those roles until he retired in 1975. Stephen Battaglio, in his book, From Yesterday to Today: Six Decades of America's Favorite Morning Show, described Blair as \\"a protege of legendary broadcaster Lowell Thomas and a consummate professional.\\" Cathleen M. Londino opined in her book, The Today Show: Transforming Morning Television that one \\"reason for his success seemed to be that because he was so expressionless in reading the news, he read it in a completely objective manner. 'One could never tell where he stood on what he was reading. In all of his 22 years on the air, nobody can remember hearing him express a single viewpoint.'\\"  Personal life  Blair and his wife, Lillian had eight children. He retired from NBC in 1975 to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. In 1979, he published his autobiography, Let's be Frank About It, in which he discussed his life and career, including some bouts with alcoholism.  Death  Blair died in Hilton Head in 1995, 20 years to the day from his final NBC broadcast.

He studied Physics and Chemistry at the University of Leipzig (1796-1797) and at University of G√∂ttingen (1797-1798). In company with Karl von Raumer he traveled through central Europe and England, and in 1811 he undertook a journey with Friedrich Parrot through the Crimea and the Caucasus.

The debut record as Flashmob was Brick House, a record that was signed to pioneering Berlin imprint Get Physical. This was then followed by \\"Ninety Five\\" and \\"Need In Me\\" which has now passed 20 million views on YouTube and was awarded the accolade of Essential New Tune by Pete Tong https://soundcloud.com/defectedrecords/flashmob-need-in-me-defected and the biggest selling track on Defected of 2012. Biography With the mammoth breakthrough single \\"Need In Me\\" (Defected), Flashmob rocked the ever crowded electronic music stage and enjoyed that rare sense of worldwide dance floor love. Not content to stay still, however, Flashmob's sound, production, and go-for-broke DJ sets have changed with the game, embracing the vitality of new house music rather than hankering after the sentimental sunsets of the good old raves. And so, Flashmob's ethic and aesthetic move relentlessly forward and onward, using the old and new to craft unique sonic alchemy from big festivals like Tomorrowland to the intimacy of small clubs on the international circuit. Indeed the past couple years are a case in point. They have seen Flashmob's tireless mastermind, Alessandro Magani, expand the Flashmob brand to include two record labels (Flashmob Records and Flashmob LTD), and an international radio show, to go along with releases on some of the most recognized labels in the scene‚ÄîGet Physical, Kompakt, Hot Creations, and International Deejay Gigolo. And while his recent hit \\"Lone Brazilian\\" popped at number one for five weeks over the summer, his myriad of upcoming releases, among the likes of Green Velvet's Relief Records, promise the same cosmic upshot. All this is to say that chart recognition and accolades have come steadily enough for Flashmob, and, while he is grateful for them, what ultimately matters in the end for his DJ sets and releases is that people see the hard work and love he puts into the electronic community. \\"People recognize the truth,\\" he says, \\"and if you're there for the right reasons a crowd will freely exchange energy with you--they will forget to be cool and will just be happy.\\" Following this dictum, Flashmob's approach to the studio and decks eschews bottle service cliches and Instagram kitsch in the service of unlocking a crowd into a groove to find the moment of quan, of higher power, of riding the beast of the night, wings out, dragon-style, flying together over old world kingdoms, sulungs and lathes.

Early life G√∂ttlich was born March 6, 1798, in the Saxon village of Nieder Leuba, then part of the Holy Roman Empire and now Germany. At birth, G√∂ttlich was presumed female and raised as Marie Rosine. At the age of 33, G√∂ttlich started to have severe pains in her abdominal section, believing the pain to be caused by herniated organs. Professor Friedrich Tiedmann from the University of Heidelberg examined G√∂ttlich in November 1832. Upon examination, he found G√∂ttlich \\"was evidently a man, with genitals of uncommon formation. She will dress herself, therefore, in men's clothes, and adopt the name of Gottlieb.\\" Career as a medical case G√∂ttlich embraced a male identity, and used his unique situation to make a living for himself. He obtained a new passport with a male sex listed and toured across Europe, allowing schools and medical personnel to examine him for a price. G√∂ttlich was examined in the German cities of Bonn, Jena, Marburg, Mainz, Offenbach, Breslau and Breme. In Britain, he exhibited himself in Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Montrose and Edinburgh. In Ireland, he exhibited himself in Cork and Dublin. In continuing to travel across Europe, G√∂ttlich reached \\"fame and fortune\\" because of his situation. When surgical aid was offered to \\"correct\\" his genitalia, G√∂ttlich was ‚Äúaverse to a proposal of this kind, since it would at once deprive him of his... easy and profitable mode of subsistence‚Äù. However, this was a reciprocal relationship. Dreger describes how: \\"in exchange for letting them examine him and publish reports about him, the medical and scientific men gave G√∂ttlich certificates which testifies that his case was of deep interest to the medical man\\". The investigators built their reputations on such cases. G√∂ttlich's case has been described as one of a \\"circus freak\\" by multiple authors. Most works refer to G√∂ttlich as a \\"hermaphrodite\\", though this term has fallen out of favor in recent years. The term \\"intersex\\" for those people with ambiguous or non-conforming genitalia is the modern term. In literature G√∂ttlich has appeared in many books, including fiction and non-fiction.

It is a healthcare caused lesion, due to entry of dental amalgam into the soft tissues. It is common, painless, and benign, but it can be mistaken for melanoma. Signs and symptoms Amalgam tattoo usually occurs on the mandibular gingiva, often in an area in which an apicoectomy (\\"root-end filling\\") with amalgam was carried out. After the gingiva, the alveolar mucosa and the buccal mucosa are the next most common sites, although any mucosal site in the mouth is possible. It is painless, and appears as a blue-black or grey discolored macule on the surface of the mucosa. The borders of the tattoo are variable, and may be well defined, irregular or diffuse. Causes Amalgam tattoo is caused by implantation of amalgam into the tissues. It may occur in several ways: * During placement of an amalgam filling, e.g. if abrasions on the mucosa are present which allow entry of amalgam dust * Shortly after placement of an amalgam filling, e.g. amalgam particles can contaminate dental floss and lead to linear amalgam tattoos in between the teeth, especially if flossing is carried out immediately after placement of an amalgam filling with a mesial or distal aspect * Polishing of an amalgam filling * The pressure from high speed turbine dental drills can be enough to force amalgam particles into soft tissue, as may occur when an old amalgam filling is being removed * When a tooth with an amalgam filling is extracted, e.g. broken bits of amalgam filling falling into an extraction socket unnoticed * When an amalgam filling is placed in the same appointment as a tooth extracted, as may occur in \\"quadrant dentistry\\" * Apicectomies are common causes of amalgam tattoo, since the amalgam is being placed inside the alveolus and the soft tissues are replaced on top Over time, the amalgam particles embedded in the soft tissues corrode. Macrophages take up the exogenous particles, and the silver in amalgam leads to staining of collagen fibers. A similar appearance can be caused by implantation of graphite (e.g. from pencil leads), and is sometimes termed a graphite tattoo, although this is less common than tattooing with amalgam. Diagnosis The diagnosis is clinical. Amalgam tattoo can be distinguished from other causes of localized oral pigmentation because it does not change significantly in size or color, although it may appear to slowly enlarge for several months after the initial implantation of the metal particles. Some amalgam tattoos appear radio-opaque on radiographs (i.e. they show up on x-rays), although in many cases amalgam tattoos have no radiographic features since the responsible particle(s) of amalgam are very small even though clinically the area of discolored mucosa is much larger. If necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed histologically by excisional biopsy, which excludes nevi and melanomas. If a biopsy is taken, the histopathologic appearance is: * Pigmented fragments of metal within connective tissue * Staining of reticulin fibers with silver salts * A scattered arrangement of large, dark, solid fragments or a fine, black or dark brown granules * Large particles may be surrounded by chronically inflamed fibrous tissue * Smaller particles surrounded by more significant inflammation, which may be granulomatous or a mixture of lymphocytes and plasma cells Prevention Theoretically, routine use of a dental dam during dental procedures which involve amalgam should reduce the risk of amalgam tattoo. Treatment No treatment is required since the lesion is entirely benign. Some suggest that amalgam tattoos are best surgically excised so as to ensure the lesion does not represent a melanoma. Others say that excision should only be carried out if there is any doubt over the diagnosis, and that amalgam tattoos are managed by simple reassurance about the nature of the lesion. For example, if radio-opaque particles are demonstrated on the x-ray, biopsy is unnecessary. Epidemiology Amalgam tattoo is found in up to 1% of people in the general population. It is the most common cause of solitary or focal pigmentation of the oral mucosa.

First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans (FPCNO) has played a pivotal role in the history of the Protestant church in the South as well as the history of New Orleans in the late 19th century, especially under the political and religious leadership of Rev. Dr. Benjamin Morgan Palmer who encouraged the Southern Presbyterian Church to secede at the beginning of the American Civil War, an action which was quickly imitated by most of the other Protestant denominations in the Confederate States of America. However, in the 21st century, FPCNO is now more widely known for its progressive stands on race, social justice and gender issues. History The exterior of the 1938 building First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans was formed as a result of a public meeting on February 9, 1818, when a subscription list was opened to purchase a lot and build a church.History of the Presbyterian Church in Louisiana, Penrose St Amant, (1961), pg 24 Gifts were pledged by prospective members and interested citizens, and the City Council gave a lot and later $10,000. The first minister, Rev. Sylvester Larned, recruited by Rev. Elias Cornelius of the Connecticut Missionary Society, began conducting services on January 22, 1818. The cornerstone for the original building on St. Charles Avenue between Union and Gravier Streets was laid on January 8, 1819. An outstanding orator and popular pastor citywide, Larned died of yellow fever in August 1820 when only 24 years old. He was succeeded by Dr. Theodore Clapp, whose theology split the congregation. In 1833 Dr Clapp and the majority of the members formed a congregationalist church which in the 20th century affiliated with the Unitarian-Universalists (who now occupy the church building across the street from First Presbyterian Church). The nine members who remained were served by Dr. Joel Parker who presided over the building of a new church on Lafayette Square in 1835. After a shaky start, the church grew during the 1830s and -40s under Rev. Parker, Rev, John Breckenridge and Rev. William Anderson Scott. A spectacular fire destroyed the first church building in October, 1854. Rebuilding began immediately and services were held again in November 1857. The new building, in 14th-century Gothic style, was designed by Henry Howard who also designed the Pontalba Buildings and Nottoway Plantation. This third iteration of First Presbyterian Church seated 1,311 persons and had a steeple 219 feet from the ground, the tallest in the city. In 1856 Dr. Benjamin Morgan Palmer, was called as pastor and remained until his death in 1902. During the occupation of New Orleans in 1862, General Benjamin Butler used the bell at First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans to sound curfew, since it was the highest point in the city. Palmer was a leader in political as well as religious affairs. He was an ardent secessionist and was influential in not only bringing Louisiana, and his native South Carolina, to secession from the Union, but also became the first moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States. So thoroughly had he created enmity that after the Civil War, not only were black members expelled from the denomination (a sizable minority), but it would take a 118 years to reunite the Northern and Southern Presbyterian churches. Benjamin Palmer and First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans later spearheaded the drive that put the graft-riddled Louisiana State Lottery out of business in the 1880s. On September 29, 1915, a disastrous hurricane destroyed the Lafayette Square church building except for rooms at the rear. Four hundred tons of debris were carted off. As before, rebuilding was swift, but it was decided to omit the upper portion of the spire. The congregation continued to worship on Lafayette Square until Easter Sunday, April 17, 1938. The federal government had indicated that it would like the site of the church for a new federal office building and the congregation decided to sell. The present site in uptown on South Claiborne Ave (only two years after being reclaimed from swamp land) was purchased. Part of the agreement was that furnishings and materials could be salvaged before the church was torn down. These were incorporated into the new church, including the organ, bell, pews, the stained glass windows except the one in the chancel, Benjamin Palmer‚Äôs marble topped communion table and his matching lectern are still in use, the four chairs and the settee in the chancel, millwork on the rear choir loft, and several marble plaques, one a memorial to the first preacher and another listing all of the pastors and their years of service. The church and the Palmer Hall education building to its left were dedicated Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939. An addition to connect the education building to the rear of the sanctuary was dedicated December 15, 1985. The Gothic style buildings built of brick with limestone trim, designed by Douglas Freret, sit on an entire square, bounded by Octavia, Jefferson, South Prieur Streets and South Claiborne Avenue.First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans, It's Buildings and Ministers, Samuel Wilson, Jr, F.A.I.A. (1988) In the later part of the 20th century, First Presbyterian was successfully racially integrated by South African medical students working at nearby Tulane University, under the leadership of Dr Wil MacIntosh, a first generation Scotsman, a civil rights proponent and a champion of inter-denominationalism. At the time of Hurricane Katrina (2005), Rev. Cliff Nunn and Elder Zane Fisher passed through ten feet of flood water around the sanctuary to survey the damage, less than two days after the catastrophe, and immediately set about the task of cleaning up and rebuilding. First Presbyterian became \\"ground zero\\" for rebuilding the Broadmoor neighborhood and much of uptown -- a job that took more than seven years and has involved over a thousand friends of First Presbyterian from all over the U. S. who have been housed at FPCNO and worked on projects throughout the city. During this time, First Presbyterian Church became deeply involved in assisting the large homeless population in uptown New Orleans, work that continues through the \\"Program of Hope\\" supported by several Presbyterian congregations. These most recent pastors led the church from being a bastion of southern conservatism to being one of the most progressive and inclusive churches in the entire South. First Presbyterian has moved from barring her doors to African Americans in the 1860s to embracing diversity on many levels, of race, gender, ability, and sexual orientation. In 2007 First Presbyterian became the first More Light Presbyterian Church in Louisiana, welcoming the leadership of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, which in turn led in 2012 to the call of the Rev. Fred J. Powell III, the first \\"out\\" gay pastor of a mainstream church in Louisiana.

Along with other patriotic writers of the era, D'Azeglio tried to counter stereotypes of Italian cowardice by showing the courage of Fieramosca and others at the Challenge of Barletta in 1503.Casillo p.86 Film adaptations The novel inspired three separate films, including two silent films released in 1909 and 1915. During the Fascist era, with Fieramosca being actively promoted by the state as hero, a fresh film version was made in 1938 by the leading filmmaker Alessandro Blasetti.Bondanella p.15 References Bibliography * Bondanella, Peter E.

Biography Lane was born at Helston in Cornwall in 1788, the son of Samuel Lane, chemist and excise-man, and Margaret Baldwin his wife. He was educated at Truro until he was fourteen when his taste for art was noticed by Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset of Tehidy, who gave him the means to practise it in London. Lane was bestowed a gold medal from the Society of Arts for an historical cartoon of The Angels Unbound. In 1808 Lane exhibited at the Royal Academy an altarpiece for Lord de Dunstanville‚Äôs church in Cornwall; in 1811 he produced Christ mocked by Pilate's Soldiers for the guildhall at Helston, and in 1817 produced Eutychus for a church in London. Portrait of Lord de Dunstanville, his patron, by John Bryant Lane In 1817 his patron sent Lane to Rome, where he remained for ten years, engaged on a gigantic picture, The Vision of Joseph, which he refused to show during progress. At last he completed it, and exhibited it at Rome. As it was offensive to the papal authorities, they expelled the artist and his picture from the papal dominions. Lane then sent the picture to London, where he exhibited it in a room at the royal mews, Charing Cross. Its huge size attracted attention, but from an artistic point of view it was a failure. It was deposited in the Pantechnicon, where it mouldered to decay. Lane subsequently devoted himself to portrait-painting, and sent portraits occasionally to the Royal Academy, exhibiting for the last time in 1884. Among his sitters were Hussey Vivian, Davies Gilbert, Charles Valentine Le Grice, and Lord de Dunstanville. Lane died, unmarried, at 45 Clarendon Square, Somers Town, London, on 4 April 1868, aged 80.

Specifications For a time, they were considerably higher-spec than competing products from larger, well-known manufacturers in that they run a fully featured version of Android 4.0.3 and can run apps without the assistance of another connected smartphone or tablet. They use a dual-core ARMv7 processor manufactured by MediaTek, with each core running up to 1 GHz as needed. Additionally, a SIM slot for voice/data cellular connectivity is included, along with Bluetooth, Wifi, GPS and FM radios, effectively replicating functionality and performance of a typical smartphone. Another unique feature of ZGPAX S5 is a MicroSD slot which specs claim to support up to 32GB of memory; however, it appears to recognize and operate with a 64 GB MicroSD. Along with its built-in memory, that amounts to very roughly 72 GB of data carried on a wrist. There is a built in camera capable of adequate 720p recording, and a built in microphone and speaker which achieves decent enough fidelity and volume to function quite well with Siri-like software on Android. Technical issues ZGPAX S5, like other smartwatches, suffer from a very short battery life. However, it (and many of its derivatives) use an easily swappable battery pack which helps considerably. Typical use life is about one day for maybe less than an hour of overall use, about 2‚Äì3 days if on standby. As it uses an unusually high- performance CPU for a watch, certain applications will drain the battery much quicker. Batteries charge roughly within an hour. There is also a known issue where the ZGPAX S5 will lose connection with the Network Operator at random, this is likely the cause of poor manufacturing of the ZGPAX S5's radio. Additionally, at random, phone calls to the watch may result in the watch restarting.

Biography Giuseppe Filippo Liberati Marchi was born in the Trastevere quarter of Rome. At the age of fifteen he came under the notice of Sir Joshua Reynolds, whom he accompanied to England in 1752. He studied in the St. Martin's Lane Academy, and became Reynolds's most trusted assistant, being employed to set his palette, paint his draperies, make copies, and pose for pictures, among other tasks. The first picture painted by Reynolds when he settled in London was a portrait of young Marchi in a turban, which was much admired at the time, and engraved by J. Spilsbury in 1761; it is now the property of the Royal Academy. Marchi did not reside with Reynolds until 1764. Known as a copyist, but unsuccessful in original portraiture, he tried at one time to establish himself at Swansea, but soon returned to the service of Sir Joshua, with whom he remained until the painter's death. Subsequently he was employed in cleaning and restoring paintings. Marchi died in London on 2 April 1808, aged 73. Works Marchi took up mezzotint engraving, and from 1766 to 1775 exhibited engravings, as well as an occasional picture with the Society of Artists, of which he was a member. His plates included portraits of Miss Oliver (1767), Miss Cholmondeley (1768), Mrs. Bouverie and Mrs. Crewe (1770), Oliver Goldsmith (1770), Mrs. Hartley (1773), and George Colman (1773), all after Reynolds, and that of Princess Czartoriska (1777), from a picture by himself.
