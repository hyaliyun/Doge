The first building was completed in July 1963 and classes began in September. The school initially awarded diplomas in occupational- specific areas. In 1991, the General Assembly converted Petit Jean Vo-Tech to a degree granting two-year college, Petit Jean Technical College. The conversion permitted expansion of the curriculum to include technical, academic & workforce education; community education; and adult education. In 1997, the College again made a name change to Petit Jean College.

The arched structure is approximately 14.6 m wide. A fragment of the Milion has been re-erected as a pillar. The Milion ( or , M√≠llion; ) was a monument erected in the early 4th century AD in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey). It was the Byzantine zero-mile marker, the starting-place for the measurement of distances for all the roads leading to the cities of the Byzantine Empire. It thus served the same function as the Golden Milestone (') in Rome's forum. The domed building of the Milion rested on four large arches, and it was expanded and decorated with several statues and paintings. It survived the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 but had disappeared by the start of the 16th century. During excavations in the 1960s, some partial fragments of it were discovered under houses in the area. Location The remains of the monument are located in Istanbul, in the district of Emin√∂n√º, in the neighborhood of Caƒüaloƒülu, at the northern corner of the square of Hagia Sophia, and close to the Basilica Cistern. History and description When Emperor Constantine I the Great rebuilt the city of Byzantium to make it his new imperial capital, which he named Nova Roma (\\"New Rome\\"), he consciously emulated many of the features of \\"Old Rome\\". Among these was the Milion: it was a tetrapylon surmounted by a dome, built in the first Region of the city, near the old Walls of Byzantium, at the very beginning of the main thoroughfare of the new city, the Mese (ŒúŒ≠œÉŒ∑ ŒüŒ¥œåœÇ), which at that point formed a bend.M√ºller-Wiener, 216 The new building fulfilled the same role as the Milliarium Aureum in Rome: it was considered as the origin of all the roads leading to the European cities of the Byzantine Empire, and on its base were inscribed the distances of all the main cities of the Empire from Constantinople. The monument was just west of the Augustaeum, and was much more complex than its Roman counterpart. It can be described as a double triumphal arch surmounted by a dome, which was carried by four arches.Janin, 104 It was crowned by the statues of Constantine and his mother Helena with a cross, looking towards the east, between them. A statue of the Tyche of the City stood behind them. From the beginning of the sixth century, the building became an increasingly important station of the imperial ceremonial. Justinian I added to it a Sundial, while Justin II adorned the lower part with the statues of his wife Sophia, his daughter Arabia and his niece Helena . The monument was also adorned with equestrian sculptures of Trajan, Hadrian,Janin, 105 Theodosius II and a bronze Quadriga of Helios. The label on the remains of the Milion During the first half of the eighth century, the vaults of the building were adorned by Emperors Philippikos and Anastasios II with paintings of past ecumenical councils, but during the Iconoclastic Age, Emperor Constantine V replaced them with scenes from the Hippodrome. During the Comnenian Age, the Milion, due to its strategic position, witnessed fights in the city, like those between Nikephoros III and Alexios I, or those between imperial troops and Empress Maria of Antioch, who from this position was controlling the Augustaeum. In the period 1268 to 1271, after the end of the Latin Empire, the Milion‚Äîtogether with the Augustaeum‚Äîbecame the property of the church of Hagia Sophia.M√ºller-Wiener, 218 After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (1453), the building remained intact up to the end of the fifteenth century. It disappeared possibly at the beginning of the sixteenth century because of the enlargement of the nearby aqueduct and the subsequent erection of the nearby suterazi (Turkish: \\"water tower\\", lit. \\"water scale\\"). In the years 1967 and 1968, following theoretical studies about the location of the monument and after the demolition of the houses placed above it, excavations revealed some foundations and a fragment (now re-erected as a pillar) belonging to the building. These remains could be positively identified as belonging to the Milion thanks to their vicinity to a part of bent Byzantine canalization. This seems to indicate the angle of the disappeared Mese, as reported by the literary sources.

The case was taken to the National Football League Appeals Board, which in March 1983 set an undisclosed compromise fee that both Essendon and Glenelg were expected to agree on. Weston said afterward: \\"I am very relieved and happy ...

Licensed to Aurora, Missouri, United States, it serves the Springfield MO area. The station is currently owned by Falcon Broadcasting. History KSWM began broadcasting in 1961. It was owned and operated by Galen O. Gilbert, a long-time radio station owner. At the time, Gilbert also owned KBTN-AM, in nearby Neosho, Missouri. At first, KSWM broadcast from a storefront location on Locust Street in Aurora. However, in the mid-1960s, plans were underway to build a companion FM station and a new studio building at the corner of Locust and Jefferson Streets. KSWM-AM and its new FM station (KSWM-FM) began broadcasting from the new building 1967. KSWM-AM continues to broadcast from this studio today, even though the FM stations have gone through many changes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the station was managed by Joe McCullah, who wore many hats at the station. McCullah was perhaps best remember for his \\"Revolving Bandstand\\" program, which played the Top40 \\"Rock N Roll\\" hits of the day. The station was also known for a \\"Quiz Bowl\\" competition between local high school teams, similar to TV's College Bowl program. Other well known members of the staff during that era were Everett Archer, Ralph Lynch, Randy Estes and a very young Les Sweckerd, who would change his name to \\"Les Garland\\" and go on be a part of the formative group of MTV. Around 1980, the station was sold to a group of local businessmen, and then to Dale Hendrix, who attempted to upgrade the station to 5,000 watts and move the transmitter site to near Republic, Missouri. Both of those efforts failed, however Hendrix did upgrade the companion FM station (KELE) to 50,000 watts and sold it to Sunburst Media, and it became KGMY-FM (\\"My Country\\") operated from Springfield, Missouri. (now KSWF, owned by iHeartMedia) In 1991, Hendrix turned KSWM-AM back over to Galen Gilbert. The station was off-the-air at that time. Gilbert put the station back on the air and try to bring it back to profitability. In August 1991, KSWM returned to the air as a stand-alone AM station from the studios at Locust & Jefferson. Art Morris was the manager and morning host. Kelly Ellison as sales manager and air talent, Kris Inman as air talent and sports director, Mariah McKinley as traffic director and air talent. These formed a core-group of people that helped to return KSWM to the air. Since the station had been off-the-air for several months, the first goal was to bring back the audience. Local news, weather and sports as well as the \\"Trading Post\\" program would help reestablish the audience. Within five years, the station was successful again. In 1993, a companion FM station was built. KELE-FM (106.7 licensed to Mt. Vernon, Missouri) was eventually sold to Radio 2000, Inc. and became KHTO, and later KRVI (\\"The River\\") currently owned by Summit Media, Inc and is operated from Springfield, Missouri. Another companion FM station was built in 1999. KQMO-FM (97.7, licensed to Shell Knob, Missouri) is currently broadcasting Spanish programming. In 2003, Gilbert signed a contract with Dewayne & Janet Gandy and Bill Lewis (operating as \\"Falcon Broadcasting\\") to purchase the station and its companion FM (KQMO). Gandys and Lewis had purchased KRMO and KKBL in nearby Monett, MO a year or so earlier. They combined operations of all four stations (KSWM-AM, KRMO-AM,KKBL-FM and KQMO- FM) in the KSWM studio building on South Jefferson Street in Aurora.

They were members of the Scottish Football League Third Division between 1923 and 1926. History A Helensburgh club first appeared in 1874 but it disappeared in 1882. Two other very short-lived clubs also formed in 1885 (reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup) and 1886. A fourth incarnation was born in 1896 and eventually took up residence at the town's Ardencaple Park. Helensburgh eventually joined the Western League, which was incorporated by the Scottish Football League as its new Third Division for the 1923‚Äì24 season. Helensburgh competed in each of the Division's three seasons, finishing fifteenth in 1923‚Äì24, seventh in 1924‚Äì25 and first in 1925‚Äì26, although no championship was awarded because Helensburgh were the only club to complete their fixtures. In a normal year Helensburgh may have gained promotion to the Second Division, but they were not asked to remain in the Scottish League. A brief stopover in the Scottish Football Alliance preceded their demise in 1928.

It was founded in 1856 and closed in 2012.  History  Dorothea Dix In 1848, Dorothea Dix visited North Carolina and called for reform in the care of mentally ill patients. In 1849, when the North Carolina State Medical Society was formed, the construction of an institution in the capital, Raleigh, for the care of mentally ill patients was authorized. The hospital opened in 1856 as Dix Hill in honor of her grandfather and was almost 100 years later named in honor of Dorothea Lynde Dix.Nineteenth-Century North Carolina The hospital grounds at one time included , which were used for the hospital's farms, orchards, livestock, maintenance buildings, employee housing, and park grounds. In 1984, the Hunt administration transferred 385 acres to North Carolina State University's \\"Centennial Campus,\\" and in 1985, the Martin administration transferred an additional 450 acres. Other pieces of the property now include the State Farmer's Market. As of 2000, a consultant said the hospital needed to close. This move was made despite the fact that the hospital was operating well and that its closure meant that mental health patients would have no local, public facility to use for care. The hospital land was purchased by the state to house the hospital. The Dorothea Dix Hospital was at one time slated to be closed by the state by 2008, and the fate of the remaining was a matter of much discussion and debate in state and local circles. As of October 6, 2008, according to the News & Observer, state officials were calling the facility \\"Central Regional Hospital - Raleigh Campus.\\" News & Observer: DHHS nixes Dix scripts But in 2009, the state announced that Dorothea Dix Hospital would not be closing and would not be a \\"satellite\\" of CRH.News & Observer: Dix to stay open, sign of failed reform It was announced in August 2010 that a lack of funding meant the facility would \\"shut its doors by the end of the year.\\" A thorough history of the hospital was published in 2010 by the Office of Archives and History of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.O'Rorke, Marjorie. Haven on the Hill: A History of North Carolina's Dorothea Dix Hospital. Raleigh: Office of Archives and History, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, 2010. 321 pp. . In August 2012, Dorothea Dix Hospital moved its last patients to Central Regional Hospital in Butner, North Carolina, which critics said did not provide enough beds for even the most serious cases. To help alleviate the situation, in May 2012, UNC agreed to spend $40 million on mental health services. The hospital is the setting for \\"Dix Hill,\\" David Sedaris' reminiscence of working there as a volunteer in his youth, published in his collection, Naked. On May 5, 2015, the Council of State members voted unanimously to approve selling the 308 acres to the city. The property is now slated to become a destination city park. Proceeds of the sale will go to \\"fund facilities and services for the mentally ill.\\" Located on the property is Spring Hill, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Venkatasubbaiah or G. V. (born 23 August 1913), is a Kannada writer, grammarian, editor, lexicographer and critic who has compiled over eight dictionaries, authored four seminal works on dictionary science in Kannada, edited over sixty books and published several papers. Recipient of the Kannada Sahitya Akademi Award and the Pampa Award, G. Venkatasubbiah's contribution to the world of Kannada Lexicography is vast. His work Igo Kannada is a socio-linguistic dictionary which encompasses an eclectic mix of Kannada phrases, usages, idioms, phrases, and serves as a reference for linguists and sociologists alike. Venkatasubbiah is best known for his work on Kannada dictionary science titled Kannada Nighantu Shastra Parichaya. This came out exactly one hundred years after a Kannada- English dictionary was authored by the German priest and Indologist Reverend Ferdinand Kittel in 1894. This work became an addition to a tradition of dictionary writing in Kannada known for at least thousand years starting with first available Rannakanda. Early life and education B. A. Honours II Year Maharaja College Group Photo showing B. M. Srikantaiah, S. Srikanta Sastri and G. Venkatasubbiah Venkatasubbiah was born on 23 August 1913 at Ganjam village, Srirangapatna, in Mandya district. His father Ganjam Thimmanniah was a renowned Kannada and Sanskrit scholar. He was instrumental in inspiring in Venkatasubbiah a love for old Kannada. His primary schooling was spread out across the towns of Bannur and Madhugiri in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The second child in a family of eight, Venkatasubbiah had to follow his father from town to town as he frequently kept getting transferred in his Government job. By the early 1930s, Venkatasubbiah's family relocated to city of Mysore. Here Venkatasubbiah joined Yuvaraja college at Mysore for his intermediate course where he came under the influence of K. V. Puttappa (Kuvempu). Venkatasubbiah then joined the Maharaja College at Mysore to pursue his Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree. His chosen subjects included Ancient History, Sanskrit and old Kannada among others. Here he came under the tutelage of T. S. Venkannaiah who taught Pampa Bharata, D. L. Narasimhachar who taught Editorial Science, T. N. Srikantaiah who taught Kavyamimamse and S. Srikanta Sastri who taught Karnataka History. Venkatasubbiah completed his M. A. between 1936‚Äì38 and was recipient of the University Gold Medal. Academician Venkatasubbiah taught English at Municipal High School, Mandya and Bangalore High School, Bangalore before joining Vijaya College as faculty in the Kannada department. During these years, Venkatasubbiah inspired his friend and colleague Ramachandra Sharma to publish his collection of Kannada poetry in a book form. This was brought out under the title of Hrudayageethe with a preface by Gopalakrishna Adiga and S. R. Ekkundi. At Vijaya College, he is remembered for starting the student magazine Utsaha. He served at that college as a Lecturer, Professor and Principal before retiring. He was actively involved in the Mysore University Academic Council and Private College Teacher's Association during these years. Literary contributions Venkatasubbiah has compiled more than 10 dictionaries, including an eight- volume Kannada-Kannada Nighantu (Dictionary). This dictionary has also been translated to the Braille language by the Braille Transcription Centre of the Canara Bank Relief and Welfare Society. He has been writing the column, Igo Kannada for over a decade in the Kannada daily Prajavani. The articles published in Igo Kannada have been compiled into a book in four volumes. It is a social dictionary which encompasses an eclectic mix of Kannada phrases, usages, idioms and phrases. He has also authored a dictionary entitled Klishtapada Kosha (a dictionary of complex Kannada words) which was released to mark the Suvarna Karnataka (Silver Jubilee of the formation of Karnataka). It is the first of its kind in Kannada language which covers different language specifications such as derivation, punctuation, phoneme and morphological patterns of Kannada language as the language has evolved over the centuries. Venkatasubbaiah is remembered for his work on Kannada dictionary science titled Kannada Nighantu Shastra Parichaya which came out exactly one hundred years after the first Kannada dictionary was authored by the German priest and Indologist Reverend Ferdinand Kittel in 1894. Between 1964 - 1969, while at the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (Kannada Literary Centre), he had the distinction of being its youngest president. As President, he was instrumental in increasing the society's financial grants from the Government. He was chief editor of the 'Kannada - Kannada Dictionary' project. He was involved in Kannada Encyclopaedia Project, Sahitya Sammelana (Literary Fest) at Karwar and Shravanabelagola and as the Editor of Kannada Sahitya Parishat's monthly magazine Kannada Nudi. He has served as the vice-president of the Lexicographical Association of India for 17 years. In 1998, he was appointed as an advisor to the multilingual dictionary project of the Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai, which comprises Japanese, Kannada, English and Tamil. He was also appointed as a consultative committee member in the Telugu lexicon project initiated by the Telugu Academy of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. He was the First President of Bidar District 1st Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Festival) held in the year 1974.

Academic use The People of New France have been recognized by Canadian academics as a noteworthy addition to the writings on Canadian history through incorporation into college and high school level coursework. The work is used in a history course at Northern Lights College and is a required textbook in a history course taught since 2005 in the distance-learning program of the University of British Columbia. The work was also included in the 2003 Historica Summer Institute, an annual program aimed at providing high school teachers from across Canada with \\"strategies and perspectives for teaching Canadian history\\". The book appeared on the reading list for a course on New France at Queen's University in Kingston, HIST 350. The book has also been assigned for HIST 334, History of New France, at McGill University, where Greer is currently teaching.

As an addition to the MTV network, it was a joint venture between MTV Networks International and Arabian Television Network, a subsidiary of Arabian Broadcasting Network, and part of Arab Media Group, the largest media group in the United Arab Emirates. Launched as MTV Arabia, the channel was rebranded as MTV Middle East on August 30, 2011. The channel began its initial broadcast on October 27, 2007, and was launched on November 17, 2007. As of 5 January 2015, MTV Middle East has stopped airing on Nilesat, and moved the whole localised channel to pay TV model on OSN under the name MTV Live HD. Beginnings Screenshot of MTV Arabia during its initial broadcast, saying: \\"You Are MTV Arabia\\"The first mention of the project came within the coverage of MTV's 25th anniversary in 2006, and was revealed by Faisal Abbas, the media editor of the London-based pan-Arab daily, Asharq Al-Awsat, which reported that MTV is \\"very interested in the Arab satellite channel market\\" and quoted Dean Possenniskie, the network's vice president and general manager for emerging markets, saying, \\"Hopefully [we] will be in the market in the next 24 months\\" but \\"it all depends on finding the right local partners\\". Akon, Ludacris, as well as Lebanese-Canadian Karl Wolf, Qusai aka Don Legend the Kamelion - the first Saudi Arabian hip hop artist, and the UAE's Desert Heat took part in the launching ceremonies of the channel in November 2007. Furthermore, Karl Wolf single \\"Africa\\" became the first ever video clip broadcast on the new music station.

It is only about 450 m long and 250 m wide but despite its small size, it has a rich history. It is closely associated with Breton legends and the lost island of Ys. In the Middle Ages a priory was built there and the island was inhabited through much of the 20th century. In the 19th century, it became famous as the site of the first canning factory for sardines fished in the Bay of Douarnenez, the beginning of the sardine industry which was important for this region. Now uninhabited, the island has become part of the national Parc naturel marin d'Iroise (Marine Park) established in 2007. It is accessible to tourists at low tide during spring tides most of the year, for a couple of hours at a time. A schedule is displayed on the mainland just across from the island, or can be obtained from the tourist office. At low tide, the island is connected to the mainland on the Douarnenez (or Eastern) side of the estuary.  History  Tristan bears traces of civilization dating back to the Bronze Age. The written history of the island begins around 1118 when, according to a charter dated 1126,Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Arch√©ologique du Finist√®re, 1905 Robert de Locuvan, bishop of Cornouaille, donated the Island of St Tutuarn and the lands belonging to it to the Abbey of Marmoutier. As a result, a priory was built on the island. Douarnenez is Breton for the land of the island, as the priory that owned the site on which the town was later built. In the 14th century, the island became known as Tristan, after the Breton legend of Tristan and Iseult. One of the most colourful figures associated with Tristan was Guy √âder de la Fontenelle, a rebel-bandit who took possession of the island in 1595. He stationed his garrison of some 700 soldiers there, and proceeded to plunder most of the surrounding towns and villages. After the island was acquired by Gustave le Guillou de Penanros in 1854, in the southern part of the island, La Planiche built a sardine press. Le Guillou de Penanros developed the harbour and the sardine processing plant on the island, the first of its kind. The sardine industry developed as Douarnenez' principal economic activity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1911, the island was purchased by Jean Richepin, an author and playwright. He built the rotunda and the Chapelle des Aviateurs commemorating the first transatlantic flight from Europe to the United States by Dieudonn√© Costes and Maurice Bellonte in September 1930.Etymologie et Histoire de Douarnenez from infoBRETAGNE.com. Retrieved 22 October 2007. In 1995, the island was bought by Conservatoire du Littoral. It has carried out restoration work on the buildings and maintained the paths and gardens. The island is now maintained as part of the national Parc naturel marin d'Iroise (Marine Park) established in 2007.  Landscape  The small island has rocky coasts and sea cliffs. From its years of habitation, an orchard, and a tropical garden were cultivated and are still maintained. Several footpaths reveal stunning views of the Bay, as well as Tr√©boul and Port Rhu on the mainland. At the northern end of the island, a lighthouse and the ruins of an old fort can be seen.  Fauna and flora  Rabbits and lizards abound on the island, as do a wide variety of seabirds, especially cormorants, guillemots and herons. The vegetation is particularly rich in magnolias, medlars and quince trees. Cedars, oak and apple trees have been planted, as well as exotic varieties of bamboo, myrtle and mimosa. A large orchard is located in the southern part of the island, in addition to a tropical garden with a giant bamboo plantation, magnolia and fuchsia.

Winston, Co. as a part of the Winston Science Fiction series of juvenile novels. The story follows the adventures of adolescent Mark Nye when he is accidentally transported to the Stone Age by his uncle's time machine. It includes a factual foreword on the science of anthropology and how Oliver uses this science in the telling of his story.Chad Oliver, Mists of Dawn (Philadelphia: John C. Winston, 1952) Plot introduction Dr. Robert Nye, a nuclear physicist working at White Sands Missile Range has finally finished his space- time travel machine after 20 years of research. On the eve of its maiden voyage to Ancient Rome, Dr. Nye's nephew Mark is trapped inside and sent back in time to the year 50,000 BC when a nearby rocket test explosion sends him careening into the controls. When Mark arrives at his destination he must survive the two weeks it takes the space-time machine to recharge for the return trip with nothing but a few matches, a pocket knife, and a 6-shot .45 revolver. Plot summary Upon his arrival in the Stone Age, Mark ventures out of the space-time machine in search of food and water. He is soon accosted by a group of Neanderthals who drag him back to their cave lair. Mark suspects he is to become dinner, so he shoots one of his guards and escapes, barely managing to evade his captors in an all-night chase. Mark finally finds a place to hide and collapses into exhausted slumber. When he awakens, Mark sees a reindeer-like animal, and takes two more shots from his revolver to take it down. After building a fire and roasting part of his kill, Mark again feels he is being watched. Rather than more Neanderthals, however, he sees a human figure resembling an American Indian whom he suspects is a Cro-Magnon man. He offers to share his food, and they establish a rapport, both realizing neither intends to harm the other. Mark discovers the man's name is Tlaxcan. In the face of an imminent storm, they cooperate to build a crude lean-to and rest for the night. When Mark wakes up, Tlaxcan is nowhere to be found, but he notices a group of vultures circling not too far away. Mark investigates to find Tlaxcan lying injured near a dead wolf-like animal. Mark tends to Tlaxcan's wounds and they set off to return to Tlaxcan's home. They reach the valley of the Danequa, Tlaxcan's people, only to be confronted by several Danequa men. Tlaxcan vouches for Mark, but tensions are still high. Qualxan, the shaman of the tribe, takes Mark alone into a cave and puts on a ritual display of \\"magic\\" in order to establish his dominance over Mark. Mark leaves the cave and uses his matches to \\"create\\" fire out of thin air in front of the whole tribe. This earns him the respect of many members of the tribe, but an old warrior, Nranquar, is unimpressed. He maintains the only way for Mark to prove himself is to join the hunt for mammoth. When the time for the hunt comes, the whole tribe participates. Their strategy revolves around distracting and agitating the mammoth herd enough that they can induce it to stampede off the edge of a cliff. At one point during the hunt Nranquar is about to be trampled but is rescued by Mark, who is himself injured. At the conclusion of the hunt the tribe celebrates with a massive feast at the site of the mammoth stampede. After the revelries Mark and Tlaxcan leave with the bulk of the tribe, returning to their valley taking as much of the meat as they can carry, leaving a small contingent of hunters to guard the remainder of the kill. When Mark and Tlaxcan return to the site of the kill to relieve the guards, they spot circling vultures and suspect an ambush. They change course and manage to avoid the Neanderthal trap, but the Neanderthals, in frustration, charge wildly after the two. This results in a furious chase across the plains, eventually landing Mark and Tlaxcan in a deep cavern where they battle a bear-like creature. Finally prevailing against these threats, they return to the valley of the Danequa. When the tribe learns of what has happened they hold a war council and decide to embark upon a campaign against the Neanderthal settlement. During the time when the Danequa are preparing for war, Qualxan hints that he knows Mark will soon be leaving the Danequa and returning to the \\"land of his fathers\\". Qualxen suggests that before he leaves, Mark visit Tloron, a Danequa holy man. Tlaxcan leads Mark deep into a cave in the valley where he finds Tloron working by the light of soapstone lamps on a magnificent cave painting. Mark realizes that he has seen this particular image before, 50,000 years in the future, yet he is witnessing it at the moment of its creation. Finally the Danequa march off to war. A battle ensues, and Mark and Tlaxcan pursue some Neanderthals across the plains in the direction of the space-time machine. The two friends prevail against the Neanderthals, and Mark says his goodbyes. He sets his return time to 15 minutes after he left his own time, and returns home.

Fisher, c.1870 Louisiana Tigers was the common nickname for certain infantry troops from the State of Louisiana in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Originally applied to a specific company, the nickname expanded to a battalion, then to a brigade, and eventually to all Louisiana troops within the Army of Northern Virginia. Although the exact composition of the Louisiana Tigers changed as the war progressed, they developed a reputation as fearless, hard-fighting shock troops. The original Louisiana Tigers Infantry Sgt and Tiger Zouave The origin of the term came from the \\"Tiger Rifles,\\" a volunteer company raised in the New Orleans area as part of Major Chatham Roberdeau Wheat's 1st Special Battalion, Louisiana Volunteer Infantry (2nd Louisiana Battalion). A large number of the men were foreign-born, particularly Irish Americans, many from the city's wharves and docks. Many men had previous military experience in local militia units or as filibusters. They (and the regiments that later became known as the Tigers) were organized and trained at Camp Moore. The famous filibuster Roberdeau Wheat, returning from Italy in the spring of 1861, intended to raise a company of New Orleans troops and then a full regiment for Confederate service. And once he proved his mettle in battle, he'd no doubt gain a brigadier's star. As such, on April 18, 1861, just a few days after U.S. Fort Sumter was attacked by Confederate forces in an act of rebellion against the United States, the New Orleans Daily Crescent carried the following announcement: \\"We understand that our friend, Gen. C.R. Wheat, is about to raise a company of volunteers, to serve in the Army of Louisiana. His headquarters are on 64 [Saint] Charles [Street], where we advise all friends of a glorious cause to repair and enlist.\\" Wheat called his company the \\"Old Dominion Guards\\" to commemorate his native state's (Virginia) recent secession from the United States to join the Southern Confederacy. With the help of Obedia Plummer Miller, a well-established New Orleans attorney, Wheat quickly recruited fifty or so men to his company, mostly expatriate Virginians, men like Henry S. Carey, a relative of Thomas Jefferson's, Richard Dickinson, who would become Wheat's adjutant, and Bruce Putnam, a towering man who became Wheat's intimidating sergeant major. While Miller, Carey, Dickinson, and Putnam continued recruiting for the Guards, Wheat was able to attract four already-forming companies to his banner: Captain Robert Harris's Walker Guards, Captain Alexander White's Tiger Rifles, Captain Henry Gardner's Delta Rangers, and Captain Harry Chaffin's Rough and Ready Rangers (later called Wheat's Life Guards), which were assembling a few blocks away at Camp Davis on the grounds of the \\"Old Marine Hospital/ Insane Asylum/Iron Works\\" between Common and Gravier Streets at South Broad (today's Camp) Street. Many of the men of these precocious units, unlike those from the more upscale Old Dominion Guards, were former filibusters who had served with Wheat or Walker in Nicaragua. Since the late campaigns, they had slipped back into their old jobs as shiphands, stokers, dock workers, watermen, draymen, screwmen, stevedores, or simple laborers on the New Orleans waterfront. As such, they were considered as being the lowest members of white Southern society. One disgusted observer proclaimed that many of Wheat's recruits were \\"the lowest scum of the lower Mississippi...adventurous wharf rats, thieves, and outcasts...and bad characters generally.\\"As cited in Schreckengost, 35-36. When work was available, these men, mostly recent Irish immigrants, were often relegated to do the most dangerous of tasks, such as servicing decrepit steam engines on Mississippi River packets or digging canals or drainage ditches in the fetid swamps of the lower Mississippi because slaves were too valuable to lose. \\"The [slaves] are worth too much to be risked,\\" recounted one calculating steamboat pilot. \\"If the Paddies are knocked overboard or get their backs broke nobody loses anything.\\" Another boat pilot explained that the reason why slaves were not used as stokers on the aged packets was because \\"every time a boiler bursts [the owners] would lose so many dollars' worth of slaves; whereas by getting Irishmen at a dollar-a-day they pay for the article [the Irish worker] as they get it, and if it's blown up, they get another.\\"As cited in Schreckengost, 36. In this social hierarchy, Irish laborers, stevedores, and dock workers were at the very bottom. Immediately above them were the ship hands, watermen, and stokers, followed by the draymen who hauled bales of cotton or barrels of sugar, molasses, pork, or flour from the Mississippi docks to the numerous warehouses of New Orleans. Because screwmen were skilled laborers, they received higher wages than stevedores or ship hands and were considered to be at the top of societal ladder. Working in gangs of five, many of them exclusively Irish, the screwmen went into the holds of the cotton ships where they used large jackscrews to compress the bales into the smallest possible size. This was a dangerous way of earning a living, for in the cramped quarters below deck a screwman had little space to dodge a wayward bale. Broken limbs were common and occasionally a heavy bale crushed the life out of a worker.As cited in Schreckengost, 36. The Walker Guards were raised under the auspices of Robert Harris, one of Wheat's former comrades in the Filibuster Wars. As the name denotes, many of Harris's recruits had \\"smelt powder‚Ä¶saw the elephant‚Ä¶[and] felt bullets\\" in Nicaragua. Since the late war, Harris reportedly became the operator of a bawdy gambling establishment along the waterfront. The Tiger Rifles, the Delta Rangers, and the Rough and Ready Rangers, however, Wheat's other cohorts, made no special claim to fame. All that is known about them, other than the fact that they were largely Irish ship hands, dock workers, stevedores, or draymen, is that the commander of the Rangers, Henry Gardner, had signed a petition which called on the governor of Louisiana to convene a secession convention and declared that the intrepid commander of the Tiger Rifles, Alexander White, was a known felon and river pilot. Similar to William Walker in stature, the fiery \\"White,\\" if that was his real name, was reportedly \\"the son of a one-time Southern governor,\\" supposedly from Kentucky. During a game of high-stakes poker in his youth, White claimed that he had shot a man who accused him of cheating. Through the influence of his supposed family, he was able to escape prosecution as long as he left the state and went underground. Fleeing to New Orleans, the vast Southern metropolis where it was easy to get lost, White most probably gambled, conned, and boozed his way through life until the War with Mexico when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy to pilot men and material down to Corpus Christi, Tampico, or Vera Cruz. After his five-year enlistment was up, he settled down, got married, and became the captain of the steamer Magnolia, which hauled goods between New Orleans and Vicksburg. During this time White once again lost his temper, severely pistol-whipped a passenger on his steamer, was arrested and convicted, and as a result, ended up in the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Baton Rouge. By March 1861, with Louisiana's secession and the subsequent U.S. blockade, White began to form a company of volunteers around his crew and was even able to rent prime space for a recruiting station at 29 Front Levee, between Gravier and Poydras streets, near the Custom House and Camp Davis.Schreckengost, 36. Wheat, using his gentlemanly appeal, was apparently able to talk Harris, White, Gardner, and Chaffin into forming a battalion under his command with the assurance that all involved would better be able to control their destinies if they acted as one. And with Wheat's eminent stature as a Mexican War veteran, a Southern partisan, a former assemblyman, and a general officer in two foreign armies, they would no doubt get the choice assignments and equipment. As such, on April 23, 1861, the New Orleans Daily Crescent carried the following announcement: \\"Gen. C.R. Wheat, with reference to raising a battalion, invites such of our friends and citizens generally, as feel an interest in the cause, to call at No. 29 Front Levee Street, where they will find the material for the first battalion of the States, and one that will make its mark when called upon.\\" With the deal cut, all commands, including the Old Dominion Guards (which was originally assembled across from the prestigious St. Charles Hotel), moved their constituent recruiting stations to Captain White's on Front Levee Street and recruitment became a shared task. To attract even more bellicose souls to his nascent battalion, men who \\"were actuated more by a spirit of adventure and love of plunder than by love of country,\\" or who filibuster General Henningsen once proclaimed \\"thought little of charging a battery, pistol in hand,\\" Wheat christened his command \\"the Tiger Battalion.\\" He then extolled his volunteers, led by Captain White's large company of Tiger Rifles who had \\"painted a motto or picture of some sort on [their]‚Ä¶broad brimmed‚Ä¶hat[s] such as: A picture of Mose, preparing to let fly with his left hand and fend with his right, and the words, 'Before I Was a Tiger,'\\" to continue to comb the docks, thoroughfares, alleyways, hotels, poor houses, and jails of the New Orleans waterfront for more recruits. Other slogans that the Tiger Rifles painted on their hats included: \\"Tiger Bound for Happy Land,\\" \\"Tiger Will Never Surrender,\\" \\"A Tiger Forever,\\" \\"Tiger in Search of a Black Republican,\\" or \\"Lincoln's Life or a Tiger's Death.\\"Schreckengost, 37-41. While the men of the ad hoc battalion continued to attract more recruits‚Äîand in some instances impressing \\"known Yankees\\" into service, shaving their heads‚ÄîWheat worked through the Ladies Volunteer Aid Association of New Orleans to help uniform the Walker Guards, the Delta Rangers, and the Old Dominion Guards in red flannel \\"battle\\" or \\"Garibaldi\\" shirts and jean-wool trousers \\"of the mixed color known as pepper and salt.\\" For headgear, the men apparently retained their own broad brimmed hats of various earthy tones (except Henry Gardner's Delta Rangers who were reportedly presented with gray or blue wool kepis and white cotton havelocks). Harry Chaffin's Rough and Ready Rangers were reportedly uniformed in light gray wool jackets and trousers with matching kepis.Schreckengost, 41. The Tiger Rifles received their uniforms from A. Keene Richards, a wealthy New Orleans businessman. Because he was \\"so impressed by their drill and appearance\\" at Camp Davis, Richards elected to outfit White's company in the Zouave fashion, viz.: dark blue wool Zouave jackets with red cotton trim (no sereoul), distinctive red fezzes with red tassels, red flannel band collar shirts with five white porcelain buttons, and outlandish \\"Wedgwood blue and cream\\" one-and-one-half- inch vertically striped cottonade ship pantaloons that would become their signature. They were also provided with blue and white horizontally striped stockings and white canvas leggings.Schreckengost, 41. Most of the lieutenants and captains of the battalion more than likely uniformed themselves in dark blue wool single breasted frock coats or short jackets with matching trousers, red or blue wool kepis with stiff black leather bills, red officers' sashes, and white canvas leggings worn over or under the trousers. The officers of the Tiger Rifles most probably wore blue wool single-breasted short jackets with red or blue wool trousers, white canvas leggings, and red wool kepis. Wheat chose to wear the uniform of a field grade officer in the Louisiana Volunteer Militia, viz.: a red kepi bedecked with appropriate Austrian gold lace, a double-breasted dark blue wool frock coat with brass shoulder scales, and red wool trousers. He also sported a buff general's sash, no doubt to commemorate his past commissions in the Mexican and Italian armies.Schreckengost, 41. While Wheat, Richards, and the ladies were gathering the uniforms, the company commanders arranged to have guidons, banners, or full-blown battle flags made for their units. The Walker Guards' banner was made of \\"blue silk with a white crescent in the center.\\" The Tiger Rifles' flag consisted of a \\"gamboling lamb\\" device with \\"Gentle As\\" written derisively above it. The Delta Rangers' flag, which became the battalion's color at the battle of Manassas by \\"the luck of the draw,\\" was a rectangular silk \\"Stars and Bars\\" with eight celestial points in a circular pattern. As the five companies were being filled and uniformed, Wheat moved his volunteers to Camp Walker at the Metaire (pronounced met-are-E) Race Course/Fairgrounds in the center of the city near Carondolet Canal and Bayou John. On May 10, 1861, Wheat was elected major by his fellow company commanders (Obedia Miller becoming captain of the Old Dominion Guards) and state officials officially recognized his battalion. On May 14 the battalion was moved eighty miles north by rail to Camp Moore in Saint Helena Parish, near the town of Tangipahoa and the Mississippi border. The encampment, named after Louisiana's secessionist governor Thomas Overton Moore, was the central depot for organizing, training, and mustering Louisiana volunteer units for Confederate service.Schreckengost, 42. Upon arrival, the Tigers were issued newly fabricated Louisiana Pelican Plate or fork-tongue belts, cartridge boxes, cap boxes, and knapsacks which were manufactured by the New Orleans-based Magee and Kneass or James Cosgrove Leather Companies. They were also issued their weapons. While the Walker Guards, the Delta Rangers, the Old Dominion Guards, and the Rough and Ready Rangers seem to have been issued either M1842 muskets or aged M1816 conversion muskets with socket bayonets, the men of the Tiger Rifles, Wheat's chosen skirmishers, were issued the coveted M1841 \\"Mississippi\\" Rifle, made by the Robbins and Lawrence Gun Company of Connecticut. Governor Moore's insurgents had seized these accurate weapons, among the best in service at the time, from the Federal Arsenal at Baton Rouge in January 1861. To offset their absence of bayonets, the Tigers were either issued or brought along their own Bowie-style knife or ship cutlasses, implements which were described as \\"murderous-looking‚Ä¶with heavy blades‚Ä¶twenty inches long with double edged points‚Ä¶and solid long handles.\\"Schreckengost, 46. With their weapons and equipment in hand, the men of Wheat's Battalion were trained in the latest light and heavy infantry techniques by the Old Filibuster himself in the pine stands which surrounded Camp Moore. Once their exhausting and sometimes frustrating sessions were over, many of the Tigers often drank, played cards, and got into fights with themselves or other units. One man scoffed that the Tigers were \\"the worst men I ever saw‚Ä¶. I understand that they are mostly wharf rats from New Orleans, and Major Wheat is the only man who can do anything with them. They were constantly fighting with each other. They were always ready to fight, and it made little difference to them who they fought.\\" Private William Trahern of the up-country Tensas Rifles (soon-to-be Company D, 6th Louisiana) claimed that he once heard Wheat declare: \\"If you don't get to your places, and behave as soldiers should, I will cut your hands off with this sword!\\" One man was in fact so afraid of Wheat's belligerent filibusters that he stayed as far away from their encampment as possible. He later wrote: \\"I got my first glimpse at Wheat's battalion from New Orleans. They were all Irish and were dressed in Zouave dress [sic.], and were familiarly known as 'Tigers,' and tigers they were too in human form. I was actually afraid of them, afraid I would meet them somewhere in camp and that they would do to me like they did to Tom Lane of my company‚Äîknock me down and stamp me half to death.\\"Schreckengost, 46. As the Tiger Battalion meshed at Camp Moore, five other men with less military experience than Wheat were commissioned colonels and their assembled companies were mobilized into regiments for Confederate service. No doubt embarrassed and frustrated, Wheat was spurred to desperate action. On June 6, 1861, he made a creative deal with the state to officially commission him a major of volunteers and to recognize his five companies temporarily as the \\"1st Special Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers.\\" With the special or temporary status secured, Wheat hoped to attract four or five more companies and become the colonel of the soon-to-be organized 8th Louisiana Regiment.Schreckengost, 46. In the political wrangling that followed, Wheat's rowdy dock workers seem to have repelled potential allies to their cause as Henry Kelly, a retired U.S. Army officer from northern Louisiana, became the commander of the Eighth Regiment. With Kelly's ascension, on or about June 8, Captain Jonathan W. Buhoup's company of Catahoula Guerrillas voted to leave Kelly's command and threw in its lot with the Tiger Battalion. As the Guerrillas were primarily the sons of native-born planters or were doctors, lawyers, farmers, overseers, or artisans from Catahoula Parish in northern Louisiana, they were complete social opposites from the majority of the members of Wheat's Battalion. Originally intending to become part of a cavalry regiment, the Guerrillas outfitted themselves in gray wool short jackets, matching mounted trousers, gray wool kepis, riding boots, and, like the Tiger Rifles, were armed with stout Mississippi Rifles, looking much like dismounted dragoons. Buhoup had lobbied hard for John R. Liddell, a prominent Catahoula Parish planter, to be colonel of the 8th Regiment with himself as its lieutenant colonel. When he and Liddell failed in their bids to gain field commissions, however, Buhoup used what was left of his political leverage to have his company transferred to the Special Battalion where he hoped to gain a field commission once it was converted into a full regiment.Schreckengost, 46-47. With six companies now under his belt‚Äîan interesting cross-section of Louisiana society‚Äîone which David French Boyd of the soon-to-be organized 9th Louisiana perceptively described as being \\"a unique body, representing every grade of society and every kind of man, from the princely gentleman who commanded them down to the thief and cutthroat released from parish prison on condition he would join Wheat‚Ä¶.Such a motley herd of humanity was probably never got together before, and may never be again,\\" Wheat resolved to get his menagerie to Virginia, the seat of war, as soon as possible. Six other Louisiana infantry formations, the First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Regiments, had already been dispatched from the Pelican State to the Old Dominion and Wheat did not want to miss the grand battle that was supposed to win Southern independence in one fell swoop.Schreckengost, 47. On June 13, 1861, not a week after his battalion's formal organization, Wheat loaded five of his six companies (the Rough and Ready Rangers were retained at Camp Moore because it failed to sufficiently fill his ranks) aboard a freight train that was bound for Manassas Junction, a major staging area for the gathering Confederate army in Virginia. In so doing, Wheat gave up his bid to form a regiment from the special battalion, at least for the time being, and his unit was officially named the \\"2nd Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers\\" by the state. To the officers and men of the battalion, however, they would always be known as the \\"1st Louisiana Special Battalion,\\" \\"the Special Battalion,\\" \\"Wheat's Battalion,\\" \\"the Tiger Battalion,\\" \\"the Star Battalion,\\" \\"Wheat's Louisiana Battalion,\\" \\"the New Orleans Battalion,\\" or simply as \\"Wheat's Tigers.\\"Schreckengost, 46. The First Battle of Bull Run The battalion first saw combat during the First Battle of Bull Run, where it anchored the left flank on Matthews Hill long enough for reinforcements to arrive. During this action, the Tiger Battalion conducted several brazen attacks, with Roberdeau Wheat himself suffering a serious wound at the foot of Matthews's Hill. The Tigers were assigned to Brig. Gen. Nathan George Evans's 7th Brigade, Confederate Army of the Potomac, and fought at Stone Bridge, Pittsylvania, Matthews's Hill, and Henry Hill. All told, the Louisiana Tiger Battalion listed 47 casualties at the battle (31 wounded, 12 killed, 3 captured, and one wounded and captured).Schreckengost, 76. \\"Report of Major Chatham Roberdeau Wheat, First Special Battalion Louisiana Volunteers, of the Battle of Manassas, Virginia, July 21, 1861. Manassas, August 1, 1861, Sir: I beg leave herewith, respectfully, to report the part taken by the First Special Battalion of Louisiana Volunteers, which I had the honor to command in the battle of July 21. According to your [i.e., Colonel Nathan Evans's] instructions, I formed my command to the left of the Stone Bridge, being thus at the extreme left of our lines. Your order to deploy skirmishers was immediately obeyed by sending forward Company B under Captain White. The enemy threatening to flank us, I caused Captain Buhoup to deploy his Company D as skirmishers in that direction. At this conjuncture, I sent back, as you ordered, the two pieces of artillery which you had attached to my command, still having Captain Alexander's troop of cavalry with me. Shortly after, under your orders, I deployed my whole command to the left, which movement, of course, placed me on the right of the line of battle. Having reached this position, I moved by the left flank to an open field, a wood being on my left. From this covert, to my utter surprise, I received a volley of musketry which unfortunately came from our own troops, mistaking us for the enemy, killing three and wounding several of my men [sic.]. Apprehending instantly the real cause of the accident, I called out to my own men not to return the fire. Those near enough to hear, obeyed; the more distant, did not. Almost at the same moment, the enemy in front opened upon us with musketry, grape, canister, round shot and shells. I immediately charged upon the enemy and drove him from his position. As he rallied again in a few minutes, I charged him a second and a third time successfully. Finding myself now in the face of a very large force‚Äîsome 10,000 or 12,000 in number‚ÄîI dispatched Major Atkins to you for more reinforcements and gave the order to move by the left flank to the cover of the hill; a part of my command, mistake, crossed the open field and suffered severely from the fire of the enemy. Advancing from the wood with a portion of my command, I reached some haystacks under cover of which I was enabled to damage the enemy very much. While in the act of bringing up the rest of my command to this position, I was put hors de combat by a Minie ball passing through my body and inflicting what was at first thought to be a mortal wound and from which I am only now sufficiently recovered to dictate this report. By the judicious management of Captain Buhoup I was borne from the field under the persistent fire of the foe, who seemed very unwilling to spare the wounded. Being left without a field officer, the companies rallied under their respective captains and, as you are aware, bore themselves gallantly throughout the day in the face of an enemy far outnumbering us. Where all behaved so well, I forbear to make invidious [i.e., onerous] distinctions, and contenting myself with commanding my entire command to your favorable consideration, I beg leave to name particularly Major Atkins, a distinguished Irish soldier, who as a volunteer Adjutant, not only rendered me valuable assistance but with a small detachment captured three pieces of artillery and took three officers prisoners. Mr. Early, now Captain Early, as a volunteer adjutant, bore himself bravely and did good service. My adjutant, Lieutenant Dickinson was wounded while gallantly carrying my orders through a heavy fire of musketry. Captain Miller of Company E, and Lieutenants Adrian and Carey were wounded while leading their men into the thickest of the fight. All of which is respectfully submitted C. R. WHEAT, Major, First Special Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers.\\"As cited in Schreckengost, 186-87. Tiger execution After First Battle of Bull Run, the Tigers grew in disrepute in the army due to their rowdy, sometimes uncontrollable behavior, especially after they were assigned to Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor's newly-formed \\"Louisiana Brigade\\" (later called the 1st Louisiana Brigade\\" or the \\"Louisianan Tiger Brigade\\"), Maj. Gen. Richard Ewell's Division, which was encamped (\\"Camp Florida\\") around Centreville, Virginia. After one too many drunken brawls and acts of insubordination, two Zouaves, Dennis Corcoran and Michael O'Brien, from the Tiger Rifles were executed on order of General Taylor. Their remains are interred at the Centreville (Virginia) Church. the Description of the execution of Pvts. Dennis Corcoran and Michael O'Brien, as reported by Edward Hewitt, 2nd Lt. in Tiger Rifles. The letter was published in the Daily True Delta: \\"Camp Florida Dec. 12, 1861 Dear Captain, A feeling of sadness pervades Camp Florida. On the 9th inst., Dennis Corcoran and Michael O'Brien were shot in pursuance of the sentence of a court martial held at Centreville. I will give you a brief account of the cause that led to this lamentable calamity. On the 29th Nov., Dennis and Mike became under the influence of liquor and were involved in some difficulty with some persons in the quarters of the 7th Louisiana Volunteers. During the melee several persons were knocked down, among whom, it was alleged, was Col. Harry T. Hays. The balance of the statement I have from an eyewitness, Capt. O.P. Miller, of our Battalion, who happened to be passing late in the afternoon at the time the difficulty was progressing. His attention was called by hearing Red's name shouted and immediately upon seeing Col. Hays with a revolver pointed at Corcoran, he sprang between them, requesting Col. Hays not to shoot and desiring Red to be quiet. He succeeded inputting an end to the disturbance, and both Corocran and O'Brien came peaceably to their quarters. Shortly after, a request cam that the two should be arrested, and Lt. Kennon, who was officer of the day, had them confined to our guard house, where they remained under arrest until after their trial and conviction - the evening of the 5th of December - when they were confined in the general guard house and informed that they were allowed until the morning of the 9th of Dec., to prepare themselves to their God and Judge. Father Smoulders, chaplain of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, whom I believe to be a sincere Christian and most holy man, visited them in the tent where they were to be confined, and remained with them up to the time of their executions, labouring for the salvation of their precious souls, and as he so lovingly expressed it, he believed their repentance to be sincere, and that his labours had not been in vain. The language of both men and their conduct were such as become true soldiers, who, even with their lives, were prepared to serve their country by submitting bravely to the fate ordered by the insulted dignity of the law. Corcoran and O'Brien both expressed themselves most patriotically. They were ready to die for the preservation of the glorious cause for which they had been fighting; and although they would rather have died on the battlefield, they were ready to die in any way for the interest of their country. No ignomy [sic., ignominy] was attached to their death. They would die a soldier's [death] and the world should know Tiger's can always die like men. They wrote a most touching and affectionate letter of farewell to their officers, spiritual adviser Father Smoulders, friends, companions and brother soldiers, advising them to abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors and instancing their untimely end as a terrible example of the fruits of indulging in reason destroying drink. The morning of the execution they bade an affectionate farewell to their companions, forgave all the past as they hoped to be forgiven, expressed a belief that a merciful God, through the intercession of the Blessed Saviour, would pardon all their sins and receive their souls for an eternity of bliss. When brought to the place of execution Corcoran saluted the party who were detailed to execute the last office with a cheerful, \\"good morning my little lads; don't grieve for use; we are going to a better world,\\" \\"Don't mangle us; shoot at our hearts if you love us. Boys, God bless you, good-bye!\\" Oh, Captain, that scene! Those strong, stern men, who had braved death upon the shores of the Potomac and fought side by side with the doomed upon the blood-stained field of Manassa, bowed their head upon their rifles, and it was plainly seen each head was bursting with agony; every eye moistened with sympathetic tears. Red says: \\"Boys it was at the C's yesterday; it is at the D's today, and I am ready.\\" Both of them requested to be shot standing, and not to be blind folded, as they did not fear to look death in the face, they had done so before on several occasions, when they were not as well prepared to meet God as they then were. They had always had the name of having pluck through life and it had not deserted them yet. Upon being informed that they would have to kneel and be blind folded, Red replied: \\"Father I kneel to God! Tigers a last good- bye. God receive our spirits!\\" A volley! Two lives had paid the penalty of their offence. Two soldiers fell martyrs to military discipline. Two heroes died. May they, in the language of Jere Clemens, have received the patriots reward; \\"The crown that hangs upon the throne of sapphire and of gold, awaiting all who die for their country.\\" \\"And which when justice placed it on their brows, she handed the record of their lives to mercy: then turned away until all that was bad and sinful was erased.\\" Captain, we who knew the men respect their memories, and grant their last request - a soldiers epitaph. I can say no more; a deep impression has been made upon my mind that can never be erased while time with me shall last and when eternity shall open for me my soul will meet and mingle in loving communion with those brave spirits forever.\\" Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign In early spring 1862, Richard Ewell's Division (which included Taylor's Tiger Brigade) was detached from the Confederate Army of the Potomac and sent west to reinforce the Confederate Army of the Valley, which was commanded by Stonewall Jackson. As such, the Tigers participated in his 1862 Valley Campaign, proving instrumental in Confederate victories at the battles of Front Royal, Winchester, and Port Republic. Because of a nasty friendly-fire incident during (and after) the battle of Manassas, the Zouaves of the Tiger Rifles (Company B) decided to dye out the blue in their jackets before the Valley Campaign, making them a ruddy-grey-brown. As for the rest of the battalion, which now consisted of the Walker Guards (A), the Delta Rangers (C), the Old Dominion Guards (D), and Wheat's Life Guards (E, formerly the Rough and Ready Rangers)(out of disgust, the Catahoula Guerrillas asked for and received a transfer to Maj. Henri St. Paul's 7th Louisiana Battalion and then the 15th Louisiana Infantry Regiment), they wore the uniform that was issued to them by their state government in the autumn of 1861: two shirts, one checked and one flannel; one bluish-gray jean-wool short jacket with nine Louisiana State buttons and epaulettes, trimmed with black cotton tape; matching trousers; white canvas leggings (buttoned); blue-gray jean-wool kepis with stiff black bills and trimmed with black wool and one variously colored jean-wool over coat. Many of the men apparently chose to continue to wear their distinctive red flannel Garibaldi shirts however, and they probably kept their issue jackets in a bedroll or pack until discarded. Like in 1861, they were armed with either M1842s or M1816 conversion muskets with socket bayonets.Schreckengost, 89-91. \\"Wheat's Tigers\\" were best known for leading the attack, crossing a burning bridge under fire, and seizing a Federal supply train at Front Royal and taking entrenched Federal batteries at the Winchester, and Port Republic.  Seven Days Battles  In late spring, Jackson's force was sent eastward to participate in the Peninsula campaign. Following Wheat's death at the Battle of Gaines's Mill and with but some 60 officers or men under Captain Harris, the Tiger Battalion was merged with the 1st Louisiana Zouave Battalion. The combined unit took heavy casualties during the Northern Virginia campaign and the subsequent Maryland campaign, where its leader, Lieutenant Colonel Georges De Coppens, was killed. The depleted battalion was transferred from the Army of Northern Virginia after the Battle of Fredericksburg. It served in various districts until it was finally disbanded in December 1864\\\\. Hays' \\"Louisiana Tiger\\" Brigade By then, the nickname \\"Louisiana Tigers\\" had expanded to encompass the entire brigade, which was commanded by Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays following Taylor's promotion and transfer to the Western Theater. By the Battle of Fredericksburg in late 1862, Hays's Brigade was composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Louisiana, and was a part of the division of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early. One of the Tigers' greatest moments occurred on August 30, 1862, the third day of the Battle of Second Bull Run, when members of the 9th Louisiana Infantry Regiment beat back repeated Union assaults on the Confederate lines, described as follows: \\"After successfully breaking up three Union assaults, the Tigers found themselves dangerously short of ammunition. Two men of the 9th Louisiana were dispatched to the rear for more but a fourth Union attack was mounted before they returned. The ensuing clash was 'the ugliyst fight of any\\" claimed Sergeant Stephens. Groping frantically for ammunition among the dead and wounded, the Louisianians were barely able to beat off the determined Yankees, who threw themselves up to the very muzzles of the Tigers' muskets. When the Tigers fired their last round, the flags of the opposing regiments were almost flapping together. In desperation Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Nolan shouted for the men to make use of the numerous rocks that lay scattered around the embankment. Sensing that the rebels were at the end of their rope, the Yankees were charging up to the base of the embankment when suddenly fist and melon size stones arched out of the smoke that hung over the grade and rained down upon them. \\"Such a flying of rocks never was seen,\\" claimed one witness, as the Tigers and other nearby Confederates heaved the heavy stones at the surprised federals. Numerous Yankees on the front line were killed by the flying rocks, and many others were badly bruised.\\"  From \\"Lee's Tigers: The Louisiana Infantry in the Army of Northern Virginia\\" (Louisiana State University Press) by Terry Jones. Another point of pride for the Tigers came at the Battle of Chantilly, September 1, 1862, where a soldier from Company D of the 9th Louisiana was credited with killing Union General Philip Kearny. During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, Hays's Brigade played a crucial role in the Confederate victory at the Second Battle of Winchester, seizing a key fort and forcing the withdrawal of Union troops under Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy. During the subsequent invasion of southern Pennsylvania, much of the populace feared the thievery and drunkenness often associated with the colorful Louisianans.Vertical files of the library of the Gettysburg National Military Park At the Battle of Gettysburg, Hays's Brigade stormed East Cemetery Hill on the second day and seized several Union artillery pieces before withdrawing when supporting units were not advanced. In the autumn of 1863, more than half the brigade was captured at the Battle of Rappahannock Station, and 1,600 men were shipped to Northern prisoner-of-war camps, many to Fort Delaware. Most would be paroled and would later rejoin the Tigers. The replenished brigade fought in the Overland Campaign at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where General Hays was severely wounded. Final organization During the subsequent reorganization of Robert E. Lee's army in late May, the much depleted brigade of Tigers was consolidated with the \\"Pelican Brigade,\\" formally known as the Second Louisiana Brigade, which had also lost its commander, Leroy A. Stafford, a long-time Tiger. Zebulon York became the new commander. The nickname Tigers subsequently came to encompass all Louisiana infantry troops that fought under Lee in the Army of Northern Virginia. Nearly 12,000 men served at one time or another in various regiments that were destined to be part of the Louisiana Tigers. The name was at times also used for other Louisiana troops, including Levi's Light Artillery Battery and Maurin's Battery, but it was the infantry that is most often associated with the term. Later, York's consolidated brigade of Tigers fought in Early's army during the Battle of Monocacy and several subsequent battles in the Shenandoah Valley. In late 1864, the Tigers returned to the Army of Northern Virginia in the trenches around Petersburg, Virginia. By the Appomattox Campaign, many regiments were reduced to less than 100 men apiece, and Brig. Gen. William R. Peck had become the Tigers' final commander. Postbellum Following the Civil War, many former Tigers joined the Hays Brigade Relief Association, a prominent New Orleans social and political organization. Harry T. Hays, by then the local sheriff, mobilized the association during the 1866 New Orleans Race Riot. A company of former Louisiana Tigers joined the Fenian Invasion of Upper Canada on June 1, 1866 and fought the Canadian militia the next day at the Battle of Ridgeway.

The population in 2011 was 14,352,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 8.50 km¬≤. History Arcozelo's name derives from the Latin words arcoze or arcu celus, both meaning small arch, from the period of the first century. The parish was a construct of four settlements, Arcozelo, Enxomil, Mira and Vila Ch√£, which initially went by the name of Santa Maria de Arcozelo, and only much later adopted the name S√£o Miguel de Arcozelo. Arcozelo is a progressive parish of the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia, losing many of its origins over time; it is assumed that in 1113, before the founding of the nation, there were references to a settlement of Arcuzello. It was Manuel I of Portugal that first issued a foral (charter), on 20 January 1518, from records in the Forais Novos da Estremadura. The village of Arcozelo was elevated to the status of town on 1 February 1988. Geography The beach of Praia de Miramar, showing the white fine sand areal Arcozelo is located from the centre of the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia, from Porto and about from Espinho, with roadways and raillines providing access to many of the centres of northern and central Portugal, and former province of Douro Litoral. With the ocean on its western frontier, the parish is surrounded in the north by the parish of Gulpilhares, Serzedo in the east and S√£o F√©lix da Marinha in the south. The beach of Praia da Aguda is one of the areas most important features, traditionally used by the artesanal fishing fleet, using techniques commonly used during older generations. In order to conserve these older traditions and protect the local marine flora and fauna, the municipal council of Vila Nova de Gaia realized project unheard of in the north: the creation of a Esta√ß√£o Litoral da Aguda (Aguda Coastal Station), that included a Museu das Pescas (Fishing Museum), a public aquarium and departmente responsible for research into marine ecology, aquaculture and fishing (Departamento de Educa√ß√£o e Investiga√ß√£o). Several of the regions beaches, include Praia da Aguda, Praia de Miramar, Praia das Rosas many of that have long lost their origins, have been converted into Blue Flag-designated beaches, attracting tourists during the summer. In addition to the civil parish seat, the parish includes several other towns and villages, specifically: Aguda, Aldeia, Boavista, Boavista da Estrada, Ch√£o Velhos, Corga, Corvo, Eirado, Enxomil, Esp√≠rito Santo, Fartinha, Fonte, Granja, Igreja, Marinha, Mergunhos, Mira, Miramar, Morangal, Pedra Alva, Pedrinhas Brancas, Porril, S√°, Sobreiro, Vale, Vila Ch√£ e Vila Nova da Telha. Economy Situated along the southern coast, Arcozelo's economy had for a long time been influenced by its ties to the sea, with the development of agriculture, commerce and industry developing later, while handicrafts and local goods produced for subsistence, then later, export markets. Architecture The parochial Church of Arcozelo covered in blue and white azulejo tile The Chapel-Vault of Maria Adelaide de Sam Jos√© e Sousa, also known as Santa Maria Adelaide or Santinha de Arcozelo With an eye for patrimony, many of the reasons older buildings have been maintained in order to provide a link to the parish's past and/or used as tourist points: the Igreja Matriz (parochial church), constructed in the 17th century; the chapels dedicated to the Holy Spirit and Nossa Senhora da Nazar√©, the buildings of Vila Ch√£ and Miramar and the neo-Roman/Byzantine vault of the Santinha, in addition to the estates and burghers homes. * Chapel of Miramar () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Nazar√© () * Chapel of Santa Maria Adeleide (), under study at the end of the 20th century, Santa Maria Adelaide, a native Porto, worked in the Convent of Corpus Christi, where she contracted tuberculosis, and moved to Arcozelo to convalesce, where she dedicated herself to a religious life of charity.

KQQZ first broadcast in 1968 as KHAD, a station licensed to De Soto, Missouri. For its first 30 years, KHAD primarily broadcast country music and talk shows. A potential sale to the Rev. Larry Rice was terminated in 2000 after a fire destroyed KHAD's studios and transmitter. Eventually, the Radio Free Texas Trust bought KHAD, changed its call sign to KRFT, and operated KRFT as a sports talk station. The sports format continued until 2010, when financial losses and the Great Recession forced the owners to sell the station. The station's license, and the licenses of three other co-owned stations in Greater St. Louis, were revoked by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 20, 2020 after it was revealed that the principal ownership‚ÄîEntertainment Media Trust‚Äîwas set up as a shell company for a convicted felon, Robert S. Romanik, who operated the stations under the \\"Insane Broadcasting Company\\" name. Despite the cancellation, Romanik continued to broadcast without a valid license on the frequency until April 12, 2020. While having carried a classic country format to the end of its existence, KQQZ also aired a controversial daily talk radio show hosted by Romanik, the content of which led to additional license challenges for having potentially violated federal law against broadcasting obscenities. The former station's transmitter site is located in the town of Pontoon Beach, Illinois. History = Early years in De Soto = This station began operations as KHAD on November 1, 1968, originally licensed to serve De Soto, Missouri. KHAD was a 1,000-watt daytime-only station owned by the DeSoto Broadcasting Company, a six-person partnership whose principles included Pinkney Cole. In 1969, KHAD broadcast 20 hours of country music a week. By 1970, KHAD affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System and played 70 hours of country music a week. By 1974, KHAD added middle of the road music and talk shows to its lineup. In 1976, KHAD had news and talk shows in addition to country music. On December 13, 1977, KHAD strengthened its power from 1,000 to 5,000 watts and remained a daytime-only station. KHAD was sold in 1981 to the Jefferson County Broadcasting Company‚Äîa joint operation between Pinkney and Judy Cole and Erich and Arlene Schafermeyer. The company maintained the previous Mutual Broadcasting System affiliation, with talk shows and middle of the road music through the end of the decade. The station was sold again in 1990 to Jefferson Communications. As of 1992, KHAD had a talk and country music format, with 12 hours of gospel and three hours of bluegrass weekly. In 1993, KHAD was sold to Big River Broadcasting, and to Schafermeyer Broadcasting in 1996 after Erich and Arlene Schafermeyer purchased the remaining shares owned by the Coles; son Kim Schafermeyer assumed the role of principal owner and handled the day-to-day operations of both KHAD and FM adjunct KDJR, which took to the air in 1990. The 1997 Broadcasting Yearbook listed KHAD as a \\"traditional country\\" music station. Following months of negotiations in the fall of 1999, Schafermeyer Broadcasting reached an agreement to sell KHAD to the Rev. Larry Rice, founder and then-owner of St. Louis television station KNLC, for $225,000. Rice had planned to change KHAD's call sign to KCBW and have the station be operated in tandem with a free store in De Soto that his New Life Evangelistic Center ministry was planning to open. On January 27, 2000, the day before the sale was to have closed, an early-morning fire destroyed the studios and transmitter facilities, resulting in the deal being postponed, then called off entirely. Arson was suspected as a likely cause for the fire by area law enforcement, but no arrests were made. Shortly after the fire, the general manager for both stations filed a complaint with the Jefferson County, Missouri prosecuting attorney after her last paycheck had bounced; Rice had also been approached by people in phone calls and letters regarding debts owned by the stations, an attorney representing Erich and Arlene Schafermeyer admitted to the debts, but did not specify the exact amounts owed. Kim Schafermeyer had been estranged from his parents since the preceding June over real estate matters; consequently, neither parent had no involvement, nor were informed about, the sales for either station, and both considered the deals \\"fishy\\" and \\"messed-up\\". = Move to St. Louis = Silenced in the wake of the arson attack, the Radio Free Texas Trust acquired the license to KHAD in April 2000 for $125,000, changing the call sign to KRFT. The station's transmitter was relocated to a new five- tower site near Collinsville, Illinois and changed its city of license to University City, serving the Greater St. Louis area. The facility changes were possible after WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana relinquished their Class I-B clear channel status in favor of a regional Class B status, thus removing a direct obligation for this station to adjust their service contours or sign off at night to protect WOWO's nighttime skywave. While KRFT was also capable of adding nighttime service, this required a separate array of towers to be constructed and additional authorization by the FCC, which was not deemed feasible at the time. Missouri Sports Radio, headed by Greg Marecek and which operated KFNS (590 AM) and KFNS-FM (100.7), entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) to operate KRFT with intent to purchase for $1.6 million. KRFT formally returned to the air on May 13, 2002 as \\"The Sports Explosion\\", carrying the Fox Sports Radio lineup around the clock as a compliment to KFNS's predominantly local lineup. All three stations were acquired by Big League Broadcasting‚Äîthen the operators of WQXI (790 AM) in Atlanta‚Äîin May 2004 for a combined $11.5 million, $6.5 million of which was used to pay down debt. Following the sale, KRFT's Fox Sports Radio affiliation was transferred to KFNS and KFNS-FM, while KRFT took the Sporting News Radio affiliation, the lone holdover on the lineup being The Jim Rome Show. In September 2004, Missouri Sports Radio and two other companies reached a $158,000 settlement with the federal government over charges that KRFT and other radio stations profited off illegal gambling activities conducted from 2000 to 2003. Despite being owned by a company that specialized in sports radio, KRFT flipped to talk radio in March 2006 with a lineup consisting of both syndicated conservative and progressive hosts, a move characterized by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as \\"an unusual radio experiment\\". Programs on KRFT included Imus in the Morning; The Al Franken Show; 2 Live Stews and The Dave Ramsey Show; and shows hosted by Clark Howard, Neal Boortz and Jim Cramer. KRFT switched formats back to sports radio on January 1, 2008, carrying the entire ESPN Radio lineup again as an all-syndicated compliment to KFNS and KFNS-FM; after WXOS acquired the affiliation rights to ESPN Radio, KRFT reverted back to Sporting News Radio programming. During this period, KRFT also carried play- by-play broadcasts KFNS and KFNS-FM were unable to carry due to schedule conflicts, or had declined to run altogether. =Romanik era=  Insane Broadcasting Company  In part due to the aftereffects of the Great Recession locally, Big League Broadcasting began selling off all their assets, having lost more that $9 million in the market over five years. Entertainment Media Trust (EMT)‚Äîwhose officer, director and trustee was identified as Dennis J. Watkins‚Äîacquired KRFT for $600,000 in a transaction filed on September 25, 2009. EMT had previously acquired WIL (1430 AM) from Bonneville International in early 2008, then the third oldest-surviving radio station in Greater St. Louis,WIL was also the fourth oldest station in St. Louis overall, preceded by KSD, WEW and WCK, respectively. renaming it KZQZ. The purchase of KRFT was immediately followed with the purchase of WFFX (1490 AM) from KSLG (1380 AM) owner Simmons Media Group, both KRFT and WFFX were valued at over $1 million. EMT's ownership interests also included WQQW (1510 AM) in Highland, Illinois, which was acquired in September 2006 from the Rev. Larry Rice's New Life Evangelistic Center and initially held the WXOZ calls. Under the name Insane Broadcasting Company, Entertainment Media Trust switched KRFT's format to classic country, branded \\"Kool Killer Kountry\\" and under the KQQZ call sign, while WFFX was renamed WQQX upon that deal's closure. Robert \\"Bob\\" S. Romanik, who identified himself in a 2010 newspaper interview as a \\"consultant\\" for Insane Broadcasting, claimed to have been run by his son Stephen Romanik, also hosted a talk show on KZQZ billed as the \\"Grim Reaper of Radio\\". This program initially aired on WXOZ starting on September 4, 2006 when Insane assumed control of that station, billed by Romanik as a \\"verbal Jerry Springer\\" where listeners could \\"be able to get things off of their chest\\". Romanik had also claimed that the stations weren't bought to \\"knock sports off the air\\" but viewed them as a good business opportunity, while playing down any involvement in Grand Slam Sports (which itself acquired KFNS and KSLG). By November 2010, EMT received approval from the FCC to upgrade KQQZ's nighttime service from 22 watts to 650 watts; included in this was a city of license change for the station to Fairview Heights, Illinois. Despite the initial claims that his son headed Insane Broadcasting, Romanik was effectively seen as the de facto head of the group and having taken a \\"very hands-on role\\" to station operations, and had been from the beginning, acting as WXOZ's general manager upon launch. The Rev. Larry Rice later expressed regret at the sale of WXOZ upon realizing the parties involved and at first tried to minister to Romanik, after being reassured that Romanik wanted to own WXOZ to play \\"some old-time songs\\", Rice shared with him a copy of I Walk the Line and stepped aside. Veteran broadcaster Kevin Slaten was hired by KQQZ in early March 2013 to host an afternoon-drive program, with plans to ultimately develop a full-time lineup of male-oriented talk programming on the station. When Slaten left KQQZ that June 27 to be part of a start-up venture time-brokered on WGNU, Romanik took to the air in Slaten's time slot the next day, repeatedly attacking him on-air for nearly 15 minutes and claiming \\"his moral compass is all screwed up\\"; Slaten responded by calling Romanik \\"a coward\\" and that KQQZ had \\"no future\\" for failing to acquire any additional air talent.  Inflammatory on-air content  Meanwhile, Romanik's talk show, which had since been moved to KQQZ, began to receive local attention for an increasing usage of pejoratives, racial epithets, misogyny and homophobia against local politicians, ethnic groups and different sexual orientations, in particular targeting elected officials affiliated with the Democratic Party and their families. When Caseyville, Illinois police chief Jose Alvarez fired Steve Romanik from his position as a probationary patrolman on February 11, 2014 due to insufficient qualifications, Romanik contacted Caseyville mayor Leonard Black, who fired Alvarez the next day. On January 2016, Romanik‚Äîvia his \\"St. Clair County Freedom Coalition\\"‚Äîheaded an unsuccessful campaign to force three circuit court judges in St. Clair County, Illinois out of their positions; all three judges resigned and immediately ran for their old seats. During an on-air interview Romanik conducted with St. Louis Aldermanic President Lewis E. Reed over the city's attempt to prevent the St. Louis Rams from relocating to Los Angeles, Romanik began verbally attacking Alderman Megan Green after her criticism of the usage of public money to keep the team, making comments about her appearance and saying she should be \\"flushed down the toilet.\\" In a Washington Post profile written shortly after the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting, Romanik admitted it was possible the perpetrator, who like Romanik lived in Belleville, Illinois, likely listened to his program, saying \\"you'd probably see a lot of people right on the same page with (the shooter) all over the country. But around here, for sure.\\" All of these events, in turn, led to Romanik's background as a former strip club owner, East St. Louis, Illinois homicide detective, and chief of police in Washington Park, Illinois drawing additional scrutiny. Following his tenure as Washington Park police chief, Romanik plead guilty on March 3, 1997 to obstruction of justice for lying 150 times to a grand jury and was sentenced to a year's probation. Three days before that probation was to have been completed, Romanik was implicated in a bank fraud investigation tied to his strip clubs. After his probation was revoked, Romanik plead guilty to those charges on April 14, 1999, and served one year in prison before being released to a halfway house. His private detective license in Illinois was also revoked in 2002, but Steve Romanik had already taken over both that practice and the strip club operations. When running against Francis Slay for Mayor of St. Louis in 2013, Lewis Reed attracted attention after his campaign finance report filings showed Romanik as a substantial donor; Reed denied any knowledge of Romanik's legal past, saying, \\"I met him about a year ago... I just know him as the radio guy.\\" Throughout 2016, Romanik ran as the Republican nominee for the Illinois House of Representatives' open 114th district seat, notably berating and verbally attacking his African-American opponent, East St. Louis council member LaToya Greenwood, during his radio shows. During the campaign, Romanik paid $3,900 to an area utility cooperative to cover delinquent electric bills for Horseshoe Lake State Park, Ramsey Lake State Park and Carlyle Lake State Park in a publicity stunt purportedly in Steve Romanik's name, who had passed away the year before. Greenwood won the election. Following the election, KQQZ flipped formats to talk radio full-time on December 5, 2016, headlined by Romanik's program and a local morning show hosted by a returning Kevin Slaten, along with The Laura Ingraham Show, The Savage Nation, The Jim Bohannon Show and The Glenn Beck Program. KQQZ reverted back to classic country on February 2017 after representatives for the syndicated programming contacted the station regarding the content on Romanik's show, this followed his repeated use of a racial slur on-air to refer to rapper Waka Flocka Flame that prompted the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial board to advocate for an intervention by the FCC. Romanik publicly asserted that he was in control of the format switch, retorting, \\"no one's going to tell me what I can and can't say.\\" Both Romanik and Slaten's talk shows were retained, and the station used the branding \\"Hot Talk/Kool Killer Kountry\\".  License challenges  Among the people targeted on-air by Romanik was Mark Kern, an elected officialRadioInsight identified Kern as the \\"Commissioner of St. Clair County\\" but the county website identifies him as having been elected as St. Clair County Board Chairman in 2004. * in St. Clair County, over repeated claims that Kern did not fully reside in the county. In one incident, Romanik drove to Kern's Belleville home and confronted his wife, who filed a police report; Romanik was arrested several days later on trespassing charges. Kern filed an initial challenge to the license renewals of KQQZ and its sister stations in 2012, alleging that Romanik was actually in control of the stations in violation of federal laws that prohibit felons from owning broadcast stations. This later was expanded to claims Romanik had gone so far as negotiate a local marketing agreement between Entertainment Media Trust and Emmis Communications on September 2016 for WQQX‚Äîitself renamed KFTK (1490 AM).This local marketing agreement was assumed by Entercom on March 1, 2018. * In turn, Romanik frequently accused Kern on-air of cross-dressing and engaged in homophobic slurs to describe him. This was not the first instance of a public figure openly questioning Romanik's involvement; former St. Louis radio personality Mike Anderson accused him of being in control of the group on his media blog as early as November 9, 2009, and called for an invocation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in a May 20, 2011 posting. Romanik threatened litigation against Anderson in April 2010, to which Anderson responded, \\"check the FCC license to see the names of the owners... I wish Mr. Romanik luck in the development of his (licensed to someone else) radio group\\". In April 2018, Missouri state senator Jamilah Nasheed sent a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai requesting that Romanik be fined and KQQZ's license be cancelled based on violations of United States Code Title 18, Section 1464, prohibiting obscene, indecent or profane language on broadcasts. In May 2018, a judge issued an order of protection against Romanik after he gave out another man's home address on his show one day and told his listeners to \\"visit\\" the other man; Romanik said that the other man had posted Romanik's home address on Facebook first. At the same time, Missouri representative Bob Burns was expelled from the state's Democratic Party caucus after Burns received criticism for appearing on Romanik's show several times; Burns claimed that audio from the interviews were edited and taken out of context. Burns would later present morning host Kevin Slaten with a resolution from the Missouri House of Representatives proclaiming Slaten the \\"Best Sportscaster in St. Louis\\" despite the mounting controversy surrounding Romanik and KQQZ. The FCC requested on May 17, 2018 that Romanik answer a series of detailed questions about the operations of EMT, based in part from paperwork filed that was to have reassigned control of the trust to Katrina Sanders in the wake of Steven Romanik's death; Sanders was found to have the same mailing address as Romanik, and was also the same address used for Insane Broadcasting and his political campaigns. On June 5, 2019, the FCC designated all four EMT stations' licenses for a revocation hearing, having discovered in this investigation that \\"Romanik established EMT and provided all of EMT's funds for the acquisition of the stations, but was not listed as a party in any of EMT's applications\\", that \\"EMT's 2012 trust instrument was executed after EMT acquired the stations and does not appear to contain provisions insulating Romanik from ownership of the stations as required under Commission rules\\", that Romanik had purported to assign EMT's interests in the radio station to his own girlfriend, and that Romanik listed himself as a radio station owner on several political campaign contribution disclosures. An analysis by communication attorneys Erwin Krasnow and John Wells King for Radio & Television Business Report called the hearing designation order \\"an eyebrow- raising tale likely unmatched in the history of FCC licensing\\" and \\"provides a road map for broadcasters who do not want to jeopardize their station licenses.\\"  Cancellation and aftermath  Following the designation for hearing, EMT filed for bankruptcy protection on September 11, 2019, listing combined assets of $2 million ($1.6 million for all four licenses and $400,000 for equipment and facilities). In a brief filed before bankruptcy court that October 8, trustee Donald Samson claimed that several buyers had emerged for all four stations, and requested the FCC to end their investigations so the divestitures could proceed. In an interview with MetroSTL, bankruptcy attorney Andrew Magdy viewed the filing as both a delay tactic and possible legal maneuver for Romanik to have control over any possible sale of the assets and profit from them, while a license revocation would leave him with nothing but debt. Despite this filing, the FCC assigned administrative law judge Jane Hinckley Halprin to preside over the four stations, and set up a timeline that November for the hearings to proceed, in which the hearing would have ultimately commenced on October 19, 2020; EMT filed to dismiss its bankruptcy action at the same time. Trustee Dennis J. Watkins, who was acting as EMT's legal representative, failed to make a single appearance before Judge Halprin after multiple requests issued to do so, then submitted a pleading in January 2020 which was found to be \\"procedurally and substantively deficient\\". This prompted Halprin to issue a ruling admonishing EMT and issuing a deadline of February 10, 2020 for Watkins to explain why the renewals should not be dismissed, writing in her opinion, \\"the time has come to question whether additional government time and resources should be devoted to this matter\\". After Watkins failed to submit any rebuttal at that deadline, all four stations had their license renewals dismissed for failure to prosecute, and were ultimately cancelled by the FCC on that March 20. , Kern had filed a proposal with the FCC for the EMT stations to be auctioned after the withdrawal of a proposal by a local black-owned group to take over the stations with the backing of the Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council; the filing also asked the FCC to insure that EMT and Romanik not be allowed to profit from the sale or lease of the stations' towers or equipment. The FCC ruling deleting all four licenses also included a provision protecting the service contours of all four former licenses, pending any future action by the commission. Despite the cancellation of the station's license, transmissions continued on the 1190 AM frequency until April 12, 2020 in defiance of the FCC's order. Unlicensed transmissions also occurred on the 1430 AM frequency formerly occupied by KZQZ that promptly ceased following published newspaper reports about both now-illicit operations. Romanik's final broadcast that April 10 was characterized with the coarse and inflammatory language common with the history of that show; Bob Burns, since term-limited from his Missouri State House seat, called into the program to express support. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial heralded the silencing as \\"taking (away) Bob Romanik's ability to pollute the public airwaves with his racism and homophobia...gone will be Romanik's constant use of the N-word, including more than 35 times in his 2¬Ω-minute closing rap-song segment. Yes, it truly is time for Romanik to drop the mic. His broadcast-ownership days are over.\\" The Riverfront Times critiqued, \\"now, it appears that a real reaper, in the form of the Federal Communications Commission, has finally done what complaints from politicians and editorials couldn't: End a the (sic) bafflingly long- lived racist radio call-in show.\\" Morning host Kevin Slaten soon moved over to an internet-based morning show operated by Donze Communications, licensee of KSGM and KBDZ in the vicinity of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.

KSIV airs the Christian talk and teaching programming of the Bott Radio Network and is one of the network's two stations in St. Louis, alongside KSIV-FM 91.5. KSIV's AM transmitter site is located along Deer Creek in Webster Groves, near Brentwood; an FM translator at 95.9 MHz, broadcasting from the master FM tower in Crestwood, simulcasts this station's programming. History =KXLW= 1320 AM went on the air at noon on January 1, 1947, as KXLW. Owned by the Saint Louis County Broadcasting Company, the station was conceived as a voice for the events and happenings of St. Louis County. Its programming included a daily farm almanac, \\"Women's Hour\\" with society and fashion news, and a noon news/sports hour; general manager Guy Runnion had previously been a newsreader at KMOX. The original tower in Olivette was ordered removed that June by a district judge, however, because the facility violated that town's zoning law; the matter would remain in the courts for years. On January 1, 1948, KXLW celebrated its first year on air by activating KXLW-FM 101.1, allowing the daytime-only radio station to add nighttime service and giving St. Louis its first full-time FM station. The county station endured a more than two-month-long strike by its engineers in December 1948 and early 1949 because there was a dispute over who should play recordings: engineers or disc jockeys. During the strike, the station ran with non-union engineers, but it was still off the air six hours one day in January because of what general manager Guy Runnion called an \\"act of sabotage\\". Additionally, one morning, county police arrested engineers and announcers at the Olivette transmitter site because of the zoning issue. Ultimately, it was Runnion who exited; under pressure from shareholders, he sold his interests to Lee, Silas, and T. Virgil Sloan, staying on as general manager until August when the new Brentwood site was ready. On November 13, KXLW-FM left the air for good, the third such closure in two weeks in St. Louis. KXLW was purchased from the Sloan brothers in 1952 by John W. Kluge, who owned a radio station in Silver Spring, Maryland, and station director Les Ware. In December 1957, the $500,000 sale of KXLW to Richard Miller's Big Signal Radio Broadcasting Co. was announced and filed with the FCC; it was approved in April 1958. =The Miller years= Richard Miller moved from Atlanta to St. Louis to run KXLW, his first radio station. Under Miller, KXLW established itself as a local force in the rhythm and blues format and one of the country's first soul stations. Some of KXLW's Black personalities, from noted jazz DJ Jesse D. \\"Spider\\" Burks to Lou \\"Fatha\\" Thimes, Sr., went on to fame in the market. In one case, a newsman who had grown up listening to the station and changed his name Al Gay to Al Sanders‚Äîat the suggestion of Miller‚Äîrose to become news and program director, and later to a lengthy career in TV news in Baltimore. In another, Miller lured DJ Columbus Gregory from KATZ by doubling his salary. However, much local talent was lured away in 1968 when KWK was revived after losing its license, this time as a new soul station. The station made two abortive attempts to change its call letters. It applied for, but ultimately decided not to use, the KELI call letters in 1959, and from March 1‚Äì24, 1960, the station was officially KMYT. In 1969, Miller acquired KADI (96.5 FM), which had previously been the twin of KADY (1460 AM). Miller changed KXLW to KADI in 1975, matching the FM station; it broke off again in 1978 as KKOJ and tried to fill the market gap for Top 40 music on AM. The next year, with Miller sensing a void in the market after KXOK flipped from rock to adult contemporary, 1320 AM returned to simulcasting KADI's rock sound and sharing its call letters. The AM station went through constant turnover of formats as music listening shifted to the FM band, with KADI AM drifting toward adult contemporary by 1981. =Bott era= In 1981, Miller announced that he would sell KXLW after nearly 25 years to the Bott Radio Network for $900,000. Bott religious programming began to air on 1320 AM on April 16, 1982; at the same time, the call letters were changed to the present KSIV, for \\"St. Louis' Inspirational Voice\\". In 1996, Bott acquired noncommercial FM station KSLH from the St. Louis city school system and relaunched it as KSIV-FM.

From 2016 to 2020, KFTK and low-power translator K254CR (98.7 FM) were operated by both Emmis Communications and Entercom as a full-time simulcast of KFTK-FM (97.1). The station's license was revoked by the Federal Communications Commission after it was revealed that the principal ownership‚ÄîEntertainment Media Trust‚Äîwas set up as a shell company for a convicted felon; this cancellation also included three other AM stations in the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area: KQQZ, KZQZ and WQQW. History The station was first licensed in 1972 as WESL. 1490 AM in East St. Louis was previously occupied by WAMV, which operated from 1935 until 1964. In July 2007, WESL changed its format from oldies to sports talk and its call letters to WFFX. In July 2009, WFFX dropped Fox Sports Radio, including Dan Patrick and Jim Rome, and changed to \\"urban sports talk\\" as what may be the nation's first sports talk format with only African-American hosts. Richard \\"Onion\\" Horton is a veteran of St. Louis radio. On January 19, 2010, the station again changed call signs, this time to WQQX. In February 2010, WQQX changed formats from sports talk to adult standards. In December 2011, WQQX flipped to a rhythmic oldies format. In March 2014, the station returned to the sports format. During its second incarnation with the format, WQQX aired local shows, Fox Sports Radio, and the Big Ten Network's BTN Live Radio show. WQQX began simulcasting news/talk station KFTK-FM (97.1 FM) on September 15, 2016; concurrently, WQQX added a translator station, K254CR (98.7 FM) in St. Louis. The translator had been acquired by Emmis Communications, KFTK-FM's owner, from Cornerstone Community Radio earlier in 2016 and relocated from Atlanta, Illinois to be used by WQQX. The simulcast allowed KFTK-FM (whose transmitter is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, west of St. Louis) to improve its coverage of the Illinois side of the market and downtown St. Louis. The call letters were changed to KFTK on September 16, 2016. In 2012, Mark Kern challenged the license renewals of then-WQQX and its sister stations, alleging that Robert Romanik, a convicted felon who is also known as the \\"Grim Reaper of Radio\\", was controlling the stations in violation of FCC rules that prohibit felons from owning broadcast stations and had been involved in creating the local marketing agreement between Emmis and EMT to operate the 1490 frequency. On June 5, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission designated all four EMT stations' licenses for hearing, finding that Romanik had established EMT and provided all the funding to acquire its stations even though he was not a party to any FCC applications. On March 20, 2020, the station's license was deleted by the Federal Communications Commission; K254CR was concurrently reassigned to rebroadcast KFTK-FM.

The parish includes the village of Pen-y-bryn. Together with the parishes of Cilgerran and Llantood, it is in the community of Cilgerran. Bridell Parish The Church in Wales parish of Bridell is on the A478, south of Cardigan and consists of a few private houses, the church (St David's) and Plas Bridell Manor house, a 19th-century mansion which, until 2019, was a nursing home. The derivation of the parish name is obscure. Lying on the western border of the cantref of Emlyn, it has always been essentially Welsh- speaking. Bridell (as Brydelthe) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. In the churchyard of St David's is a high stone cross whose inscription appears unreadable, but has been deciphered as Nettasagri maqi mucoi Briaci, and commemorates a man named Nettasagri, the son of the kin of Briaci. The stone is believed to be 5th century, and was probably \\"Chritianised\\" with a cross later. The language is Ogham. The parish area was estimated at in 1844 with a population of 404. Official census figures were: 248 (1801): 335 (1851): 237 (1901): 220 (1951): 221 (1981) with the proportion of Welsh speakers 94 per cent (1891), 90 per cent (1931) and 51 per cent (1971). In 1890, local clergy were reported to be in \\"great distress\\" through the failure to collect tithes amounting to ¬£1,738 over six parishes, with Bridell owed ¬£249; previous attempts at recovery had been \\"crushed by riotous crowds\\". Pen-y-bryn Pen-y-bryn Baptist Chapel Pen-y-Bryn (English meaning: top of the hill), also referred to as Penybryn, is a small village situated on the northern side of the parish at a crossroads dominated by the Pen-y-Bryn Arms public house on one side and the Grade II-listed Penybryn Baptist Chapel, established in 1818 and rebuilt in 1869, on the other. Pen-y-bryn has outgrown Bridell owing to a building surge in the latter part of the 20th century driven both by local need and by immigration from other parts of Wales and the UK. Pen-y-bryn Arms The Pen-y-bryn Arms has stood at the crossroads at least since the 18th century and enjoys both local and passing trade, standing as it does on the main route into Cardigan from the south. The site formerly included a petrol station and garage, both now closed. There is a Victorian post box embedded in the front wall.

The New Jersey-born Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, a friend and colleague of Rev.

Nearly a week after the collapse of the deepest coal mine in the world, long after all the missing were presumed dead, two groups of miners‚Äîinjured and desperately dehydrated‚Äîwere discovered a vertical mile underground. The worldwide focus on the rescue of the first group‚Äîthrough newspapers, television news reports, and movie theater news-reels‚Äîinspired a few highly placed officials in the administration of Governor Marvin Griffin of Georgia, a staunch segregationist, to invite the survivors and their families to vacation on the coastal resort of Jekyll Island. The state officials conceived it as a PR gimmick that would enlighten the world about the Georgia coast as a tourist destination equal to Florida's beaches. However, a second group of miners was found alive; when the survivors were finally extricated, the \\"last man out\\" turned out to be a Black Nova Scotian, Maurice Ruddick. All tourist accommodations in Georgia were segregated. Rather than a brilliant PR coup, Georgia officials inadvertently insulted Ruddick, a Canadian hero, causing a minor international incident.

Operation Benedict, the 1941 expedition to Murmansk provided air defence for Allied ships as they were discharging at ports within range of units in Norway and Finland, then converted Soviet air and ground crews to British Hawker Hurricane IIB fighters and their Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, many of which were due to be delivered under British Lend-Lease arrangements. In the five weeks of Benedict, 151 Wing claimed 16 victories, four probables and seven aircraft damaged. Conversion of Soviet Air Forces () pilots and ground crew to Hurricanes began in mid- October. At the end of November the RAF party returned to Britain, less some signals staff and the wing was disbanded. On 10 March 1944, 151 Wing was reformed in Iraq with transport aircraft, then disbanded again on 1 June 1946. From 1 October 1959 to 9 September 1964, 151 Wing was an air defence missile unit, then disbanded for the last time. Background Within days of the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), Britain and the USSR entered into a formal military alliance. Anxious to offer immediate support to their new ally, British submarines, minelayers and aircraft carriers quickly put in an appearance off the north coast of Finland. On 31 July 1941, carrier-borne aircraft from conducted the Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo. The British lost three aircraft and inflicted only minor damage on a small freighter and harbour facilities. In a further attempt to hinder naval traffic in the area, the Royal Navy mined the approaches to Petsamo. Prelude The Dervish convoy assembled at Reykjavik in Iceland, consisting of six merchant ships Lancastrian Prince, New Westminster City, Esneh, Trehata, the elderly Llanstephan Castle loaded with raw materials and 15 crated Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft, the fleet oiler and the Dutch freighter Alchiba. Departing for Russia on 21 August, the convoy was escorted by the destroyers , and , the minesweepers , and , and the anti-submarine Shakespearian class trawlers , and . Distant cover came from the fleet carrier and the cruisers and . The old aircraft carrier (a veteran of World War I) took part in the parallel Operation Strength with the heavy cruiser and the destroyers , and . Strength delivered the personnel of No. 151 Wing RAF Royal Air Force to Russia and the 24 Hurricanes were flown off Argus direct to Vaenga (later renamed Severomorsk) airfield, near Murmansk. Largely owing to the scarcity of Luftwaffe aerial reconnaissance aircraft in the region, the ships arrived safely. Operation Benedict On 12 July 1941, a Soviet commission met representatives of the Royal Navy and the RAF in London and it was decided to use the airfield at Vaenga (now Severomorsk) to defend Allied ships while unloading at the ports of Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Polyarnoe. No. 151 Wing RAF (Neville Ramsbottom-Isherwood) was established, comprising 81 Squadron and 134 Squadron, equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. The pilots had come from 81 Squadron, 504 Squadron or had just completed their training. The wing was to be transported to north Russia in Operation Dervish, the first Arctic convoy, to operate until the weather in October or November grounded the aircraft. During the winter lull, the fighters were to be handed over to the Soviet Air Forces (VVS, Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily). The majority of the airmen embarked on the steamship SS Llanstephan Castle together with 15 Hurricanes packed in crates, at the Scapa Flow anchorage in the Orkney Islands. The remaining 24 aircraft went on board the aircraft carrier Argus as part of Operation Strength, in which the carrier, a cruiser and three destroyers, carried the RAF party. The ships departed from Scapa Flow on 17 August 1941 and the Hurricanes from Argus landed at Vaenga, about from Murmansk to find a large and fairly well equipped airfield occupied by a medium bomber squadron. attacks on Dervish led to the ships docking at Archangelsk to the east. No facilities existed for the assembly of the crated Hurricanes; improvisation and the co-operation of the local Russians overcame the lack of specialist equipment, such as airscrew spanners and the job took nine days. The aircraft were flown to Vaenga on 12 September, except for two Hurricanes, whose pilots succumbed to Russian hospitality at a refuelling stop and had to continue the morning after. Vaenga airfield had an adequate surface of compacted sand which became very bumpy in wet weather. Airfield facilities were linked by a tarmac road but beyond the perimeter, there were only cart tracks. Accommodation was in brick buildings but wooden huts were found to be unkempt. Bedding was new, the food was ample, though some considered to be a little greasy and the sanitation was hideous, leading to the British naming the main latrine, directly over a cesspit, \\"The Kremlin\\". Co-operation from the Russians was excellent and Isherwood established rapport with the Soviet commanding general and gained the agreement of the Russians on bomber escort tactics. Within 24 hours of commencing operations, the wing shot down its first German aircraft. On 12 September, five Hurricanes of 81 Squadron intercepted a Henschel reconnaissance aircraft and five Messerschmitt Bf 109 escorts from Petsamo. The Hurricanes carried only six of their battery of eight machine-guns but shot down three Bf 109s and damaged the Henschel for a loss of one aircraft and pilot. In its five weeks of operations, the wing claimed 16 victories, four probables and seven aircraft damaged. The winter snows began on 22 September and the conversion of VVS pilots and ground crew to Hurricanes began in mid-October. In late November the RAF party returned, less various signals staff. During a scramble, the pilot of a 134 Squadron Hurricane taxied with two airmen sitting on the tail to counter the bumpy surface. The pilot took off unaware that the airmen were still there and crashed soon after, the pilot being seriously injured and the airmen killed. Aftermath =Analysis= 151 Wing \\"carried out 365 sorties during its stay at Vaenga, claiming 11 Messerschmitt fighters and three Ju 88 bombers shot down\\" The main objectives of the 1941 expedition to Murmansk, to show the quality of the Hurricane aircraft when properly handled and to train Soviet pilots and their ground crews on the British military equipment, that would soon be supplied to the Soviet Union. The operation was judged to have fulfilled these objectives.RAF campaigns :Murmansk, 1941 , Chapter I, paragraphs 6‚Äì8 Only 81 Squadron received the battle honour 'Russia, 1941'. The Soviet Union recognised the contribution of No. 151 Wing, by the awards of the Order of Lenin to Wing Commander Ramsbottom-Isherwood, Squadron Leaders A. H. Rook and A. G. Miller and Flight Sergeant Haw.RAF Records In 1944, the Engineering Officer in charge of assembling the Hurricanes, Flight Lieutenant Gittins, was awarded the Order of the Red Star.RAF Hurricanes in Russia =Subsequent operations= On 5 July 1942, No. 153 Wing RAF was raised in England with the intention of resuming RAF operations on the front. This was a force of four squadrons of Supermarine Spitfires and two squadrons of ground- attack Hurricanes. This would have involved around personnel. Possibly due to increased convoy casualties, the operation was called off and 153 Wing was stood down. =Operation Orator= On 2 September 1942, two Bomber Command units, 144 Squadron and 455 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, flew 32 Handley Page Hampdens from Britain to Murmansk. The Hampdens had been refurbished as torpedo-bombers and Operation Orator was designed to cover Convoy PQ 18. The Admiralty did not want a repeat of the tragedy that befell Convoy PQ 17, destroyed by the U-boats and Luftwaffe. The British wanted to protect the convoy from the German surface fleet, especially the battleship .Vladimir Kropunik RAF aircraft crashed in Swedish Lapland :wreck and remains of crew recovered, 1976 Nine Hampdens were lost en route, due mainly to harsh Arctic weather, compass failures, German fighters and anti-aircraft fire. The squadrons operated briefly from Vaenga air base, before handing their Hampdens over to the Soviet Air Force. Commonwealth aircrew under RAF command remained active in the Murmansk area until 1944, operating Catalina, Lockheed Hudson and photoreconnaissance Spitfire aircraft from Vaenga and Lakhta, supporting Arctic convoys with maritime patrol and escort flying.Vladimir Kropunik , paragraphs 6 and 10 151 Wing redux No. 151 Wing was reformed on 10 March 1944 as a transport wing headquartered at RAF Habbaniya in Iraq, and operated until its disbanding on 1 June 1946. From 1 October 1959 to 9 September 1964, 151 Wing was an air defence missile unit, probably operating Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles.

According to data from Japan's National Tax Agency for 2017, approximately 382,000 kiloliters of wine was purchased in Japan, of which two- thirds was imported wine. Of the 102,000 kiloliters of wine domestically produced that year, only a fifth came from domestically grown and harvested grapes. The Agency states the share of Japanese wine, as defined as domestically produced wine from domestically grown grapes, as only 4% of total domestic consumption, or 14,988 kiloliters. Only 58 kiloliters of Japanese wine was exported overseas. The main region for winemaking in Japan is in Yamanashi Prefecture which accounts for approximately a third of domestic production, although grapes are cultivated and wine is also produced in more limited quantities by vintners throughout the country, from Hokkaido in the North to Miyazaki Prefecture on the Southern island of Kyushu. History =Early history= Legend has it that grape-growing in Japan began in 718 AD, in Katsunuma, Yamanashi Prefecture. The first regularly documented wine consumption in Japan was however in the 16th century, with the arrival of Jesuit missionaries from Portugal. Saint Francis Xavier brought wines as gifts for the feudal lords of Ky≈´sh≈´, and other missionaries continued the practice, resulting in locals acquiring taste for wine and importing it regularly. They called the Portuguese wine , combining the Portuguese word tinto (chinta in Japanese) meaning red and meaning liquor. =Meiji Era= A report written in 1869 by Adams, Secretary to the British Legation in Yedo, describes \\"a quantity of vines, trained on horizontal trellis frames, which rested on poles at a height of 7 or 8 feet from the ground\\" in the region of Koshu, Yamanashi. It was not until 1873 however, after detailed reports on European wine culture were made available by returning members of the Iwakura Mission, that more focused attempts were made to promote domestic wine production. The first attempt to produce wine locally, using mainly sake brewing equipment, was undertaken by Hironori Yamada and Norihisa Takuma in Kofu, Yamanashi, in 1875. In 1877, the newly formed winery Dai-Nihon Yamanashi Budoshu in Katsunuma, Yamanashi dispatched Masanari Takano and Ryuken Tsuchiya to Troyes in the Champagne region of France to learn viticulture and wine production techniques. The cultivation of European grape varieties formed the core of early Japanese attempts, however the project was all but destroyed in 1884 by an outbreak of Phylloxera that arrived via imported root stock. =20th century= In many prefectures a few small scale viniculturists remained, but it was not until after World War II that the scale of winemaking began to grow. However, in comparison to the growth of imported wines and the production of low cost retail wines from imported grape juices, domestically grown and harvested wine still remained at an early stage of development. Advertising poster of \\"AKADAMA Port Wine‚Äù, the first published in 1922In terms of Japanese taste for domestically produced wine, astringency and acidity were not readily accepted at the beginning.2 For a long time sugars such as honey were added to moderate the flavor and wine was the mainstay. In 1907, Shinjiro Torii, founder of the Suntory beverages empire launched with an advertising campaign in 1922 that both scandalized with its suggestion of nudity, and prompted a huge boost to sales. The trend for sweetened, fortified and medicinal tonic wines continued until the 1970s when wine was still fundamentally known as , and only a small minority imported and drank European wine.3 During the 1970s and 80s the skill level of wine making increased and the purchases of both imported and domestic wine grew with the rapidly expanding economy. Specialists began to call their holdings \\"wineries\\", and the emulation of Western style hedging and cultivation of insect resistant grape varieties spread. For the first time domestic wineries began to focus on producing superior wines using only domestically cultivated grapes. Also, in response to demand from Japanese consumers, the production of organic wines also became popular. In the 1990s and 2000s due to a reduction in taxes on imported wine and a diversification of Japanese food culture, wine consumption continued to grow. In 1995, Shinya Tasaki became the first Japanese to be awarded the title of Meillieur Sommelier du Monde, and helped to significantly raise public awareness of wine appreciation. Media attention given to the beneficial effects of polyphenol (tannins) and local government led efforts to promote high quality domestically produced wine also contributed to industry expansion. From 2002 onward, leading with Yamanashi Prefecture, competitions focused on \\"Japanese wine using only 100% Japanese grapes\\" began. Successful ratification of the TPP trade agreement will likely bring significant changes to domestic Japanese wine production. Once ratified, tariffs on imported wine are scheduled to be eliminated in eight years. New competition from large scale overseas wine producers, particularly from the United States, Australia and New Zealand will be balanced with a staged reduction in taxes levied on locally produced wines. Differing tariff regimes levied against the import of grapes for table consumption and wine production have often led Japanese farmers to focus on high margin table grapes at the expense of domestic wine production. Vine cultivation Elevated vine trellises, K≈çsh≈´, YamanashiTo accommodate the challenges of climate and terrain in Japan vine cultivation techniques have been extensively adapted. In areas of high humidity during the summer, an elevated horizontal hedging technique known as is used to keep the fruit about 1.5‚Äì2 meters above the ground to allow ventilation. Horizontal trellises have also proven effective in reducing wind damage from typhoons. On sloping land, Italian ryegrass is often planted under the vines to help prevent soil erosion. In areas higher in the mountains, such as Tochigi, where good sunlight is at odds with the jagged terrain, winemakers have planted their hedges on steep hillsides both to receive a maximum of sunlight, as well as protect the vines against damage from heavy snowfall. Industry structure Japanese Shinsh≈´ Wine (‰ø°Â∑û„ÉØ„Ç§„É≥) from Nagano PrefectureThere are relatively few independent wine producers in Japan, the industry being dominated by large beverage conglomerates such as Suntory, owner of the Snaraku, and Manns Wine brands, Sapporo trading with brands such as Chateau Lion, Delica, and Kirin through its Mercian Corporation operating subsidiary, owner of the Chateau Mercian label.Robinson, Oxford Companion to Wine, p.380 All the major beverage conglomerates have access to domestically grown grapes, but given the challenge of climate on domestic grape production, three quarters of the wine bottled by Japanese producers relies to some extent on imported bulk wine or grape concentrate. Domestically produced mass market wines using imported wine or grape concentrate are required by law to note this on the label. Japanese wines produced using only 100% domestic grape content command a price premium and are only occasionally exported. Smaller, family or city owned wineries of note gaining a reputation for producing domestically grown wines of consistently better quality include Marufuji, Kizan, Katsunuma Jozo, Grace (all in Yamanashi Prefecture) Takeda (Yamagata Prefecture) and Tsuno (Miyazaki Prefecture). Major wine producing regions of Japan In Japan the main regions for wine production, listed in order of production volume of wine made from domestically-grown grapes, are Yamanashi (31%), Nagano (23%) and Hokkaid≈ç (17%). In Yamanashi, the main wine region is the Koshu Valley, an area that centers around the town of Koshu and is home to 70 of the approximately 80 wineries in the prefecture. In Hokkaid≈ç, the town of Ikeda recovered economically from a state of bankruptcy with regional planning toward grape growing and wine production and within 20 years following 1960 was able to make it successful. Thereafter, every region began to foster production, the main cause of which was the influence of the nationwide . In Yamagata during World War II wine was produced in large amounts for the military to provide the dietary supplement cream of tartar, and because the soil in Yamagata is suitable for fruit cultivation, today it is one region that is home to numerous well known producers.

Japanese grape varieties Japan supports a wide range of grape varieties although the vast majority of this production is for table consumption and only a small percentage is used in domestic wine making. Strictly speaking there are no vines native to Japan, although the Koshu white wine grape has evolved locally over many centuries and is therefore considered an indigenous variety. Hardy varietals imported from North America such as the Delaware and Niagara grape were widely planted in the post war period, but since 1985 have significantly declined in popularity. Premium table consumption grapes such as Kyoho and more recently Pione, a hybrid cultivar of Kyoho and Cannon Hall Muscat, command significant price premiums for producers. Grapes used only used for winemaking are produced in limited quantities as price margins for table grapes are often significantly higher. Imported wine grape cultivars include M√ºller-Thurgau, Chardonnay, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. =Koshu= Koshu grape Muscat Hamburg grape Koshu is a white wine grape variety grown primarily in Yamanashi Prefecture. The grape varietal developed from vines likely imported from the Caucasus through the Silk Road, at a period estimated to be around a thousand years ago.Koshu of Japan website, page of ‚ÄúAbout Koshu‚Äù. The grape is a hybrid variety indigenous to Japan, and benefits from a relatively thick skin able to withstand the damp of the Japanese Summer.‚ÄúKOSHU wine gets uncorked abroad‚Äù. Felicity Hughes, The Japan Times, Jun 10, 2011 The name ‚ÄúKoshu‚Äù is a former name for Yamanashi. Characteristics of wines made from the Koshu grape are typically a pale, straw colour and a soft, fruity bouquet with overtones of citrus and peach. The taste is often described as clean, delicate and fresh, considered a good match for Japanese cuisine.Koshu of Japan website, page of ‚ÄúTaste‚Äù =Muscat Bailey A= is a red wine grape hybrid developed by (1868‚Äì1944) at the in Niigata Prefecture. Kawakami's goal was to develop a grape for wine adapted to Japan's climate. He did this by mixing the type grape with \\"Muscat Hamburg\\" type grape to give birth to a red wine grape that is widely used in Japan. Also developed by Kawakami was the variety known as . The characteristics of Muscat Bailey-A are a very grape juice-like flavor and it is most widely used in sweet amakuchi wines. However, in recent years, drier varieties and barrel aged varieties have also been developed. Muscat Bailey-A has been blended with western grapes creating a very full bodied, Bordeaux style flavour. In addition, different blending has led to smoother Bourgogne/Burgundy varieties. Designation of Origin is a system of legal designation for wine produced in Japan, much like France's Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) laws and the United States' American Viticultural Area (AVA) designations. In Japan there is no nationwide organization of legal designation, regardless of domain of origin or types of grape, anything that is fermented domestically can be labeled as \\"Japanese wine\\". Because of this, there are some products labeled as Japanese that are produced using imported grape juice.4 However, independent self-governing municipal bodies have begun systems of regional appellation. For example, Nagano Prefecture's , and K≈çsh≈´'s .

It is situated in the north of the county on the slopes of Frenni Fawr, one mile (2 km) north of Crymych and included much of the village of Blaenffos. Origin of the name The placename is an archaic Welsh word meaning \\"little castle\\". History 260px The parish had an area of . It was originally a chapelry of the parish of Penrydd (several alternate spellings), granted by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, to the Knights Hospitallers of Slebech c.1130 and was returned in the Valor Ecclesiasticus (1291) as paying 13s 4d (two-thirds of a pound) per annum. Castellan (as Cap. Kestellan) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. In 1684 the rector and churchwardens of Penrith (sic) and Castellan declared the chapel to be \\"out of repair\\", the bier having been stolen some 28 years previously. It was annexed to Penrhudd Parish soon after the dissolution of the monasteries but was abandoned by c.1700 and in ruins by 1833. The church is no longer marked on Ordnance Survey maps. The 1831 census lists the chapelry as having 26 families in as many homes with no uninhabited buildings; 17 of the families were chiefly involved in agriculture and 7 in trades, crafts or manufacture. Tithe apportionment (1837) and map (1844) are held at the National Archives. Prior to 1850 the parish included Blaenffos, Clover Hill, Frenni Fawr, Gorsfaith and Moelfryn with a population of 127 in 1833; earlier censuses included Castellan with Penrith and formed an extensive part of the parish of Penrith (sic). In 1833 (despite the chapel being in ruins) the incumbent received one guinea annually from Sir R.B.P. Philipps of Picton Castle. In 1881 more than half of men still worked in agriculture with the remainder in trades; while a few women were in domestic service or trade, the majority are listed as \\"unknown occupation\\", presumably housewives. The 1881 census records David Nicholas aged 37 as farming 57 acres, having been born in Castellan; Nicholas was the father of Thomas Evan Nicholas. By 1901 there were more than 40 houses in the parish, dipping to 37 in 1931 but rising to 46 in 1961. The site of the chapel, described in the Inventory (visited 1915) as \\"a building 26 feet by 17 feet. A fragment of walling about 5 feet in height marks the east end of the little church.\\", is still visible. The northern part of the parish is now in the community of Boncath, and the southern part is in Crymych community. The name of the parish survives in Castellan Farm, near the site of the chapel which, according to Geograph, is no longer accessible. Demography Castellan's census population was estimated (being counted with Penrydd parish) as 82 in 1801 and 105 in 1811. Subsequently the population grew to a maximum of about 170 in the mid-19th century, to a minimum of 115 in 1951, and thereafter grew to 162 by 1981.

He started his first band, All She Wrote, at just 15 years old. In 1999, he joined the band Climate Control, playing drums and singing backing vocals. Several of the band's earlier shows at The Neutral Ground coffee shop were shut down due to the packed crowd breaking the firecode. They released a full-length CD, \\"Clutch,\\" and in 2001, recorded a 4-song ep, \\"The Timely Demise of Climate Control,\\" which was released for free online in 2007. While attending Louisiana State University, Jonathan switched to guitar and lead vocals in the band tWeezer, a Weezer cover band. They won the 2001 LSU Battle of the Bands and opened for such acts as Stroke 9, and The Verve Pipe. Also during this time, Pretus played in the short-lived Monophonic, which featured the Pretus-penned \\"Waiting To Fall\\" on a compilation of up-and-coming Louisiana artists. In 2005, Pretus was a co- founder of New Orleans band The Garden District, in which he wrote, was co- lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist.

In late 2006, the group released their debut ep, \\"So Much It Hurts,\\" which was produced by Fred LeBlanc of Cowboy Mouth and Tom Drummond of Better than Ezra. While the band leaned more towards the \\"emo\\" tag, Pretus' songs, such as \\"Avalanche,\\" \\"Intrepid Inventions,\\" and the live favorite \\"So Low,\\" focused on a more straight-ahead, melodic rock approach. In addition to Garden District duties, he toured with Cowboy Mouth for several weeks early in the year, eventually joining Cowboy Mouth in 2007. In 2010, Pretus left Cowboy Mouth to start The Breton Sound with Stephen Turner. Fortified by New Orleans' Bourgeois brothers John (drums) and Joe (bass), The Breton sound has since won the Louisiana Music Prize, released 4 EPs, and toured the United States including slots on the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Voodoo Music + Arts Experience, and the upcoming Louder Than Life 2018 Festival in Louisville, KY.

He went on to study in Akmola in the primary parish school and the Akmola three-class city school. In addition, he taught Russian at a Muslim madrasah. On August 21 of 1913, Seifullin entered the Omsk teaching seminarium. His first article was published in the November edition of Ay Qap magazine.

It was the first U.S. Supreme Court ruling to deal with homosexuality and the first to address free speech rights with respect to homosexuality. The Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling that the gay magazine ONE magazine violated obscenity laws, thus upholding constitutional protection for pro-homosexual writing. ONE, Inc., a spinoff of the Mattachine Society, published the early pro-gay \\"ONE: The Homosexual Magazine\\" beginning in 1953. After a campaign of harassment from the U.S. Post Office Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles Postmaster Otto Olesen declared the October 1954 issue \\"obscene, lewd, lascivious and filthy\\" and therefore unmailable under the Comstock laws. In that issue, the Post Office objected to \\"Sappho Remembered\\", a story of a lesbian's affection for a twenty-year-old \\"girl\\" who gives up her boyfriend to live with her, the lesbian, because it was \\"lustfully stimulating to the average homosexual reader\\"; \\"Lord Samuel and Lord Montagu\\", a poem about homosexual cruising that it said contained \\"filthy words\\"; and (3) an advertisement for The Circle, a magazine containing homosexual pulp romance stories, that would direct the reader to other obscene material. The magazine, represented by a young attorney who had authored the cover story in the October 1954 issue, Eric Julber, Julber's article was \\"You Can't Print It!\\", about how to steer clear of government censorship policies.

He wrote: \\"The suggestion advanced that homosexuals should be recognized as a segment of our people and be accorded special privilege as a class is rejected.\\" A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision unanimously in February 1957. Julber filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court on June 13, 1957. On January 13, 1958, that court both accepted the case and, without hearing oral argument, issued a terse per curiam decision reversing the Ninth Circuit.

By protecting ONE, the Supreme Court facilitated the flourishing of a gay and lesbian culture and a sense of community\\" at the same time as the federal government was purging homosexuals from its ranks.

Its words tell the story of Ira Hayes, one of the six Marines who became famous for having raised the flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima of World War II. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Content Hayes was depicted on the Iwo Jima Memorial as one of 6 men raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima In the song, La Farge introduces the Pima Indians, a tribe that occupied an oasis in the Arizona desert. La Farge then claims that when the U.S. started settling the area in the late 19th century, \\"the white men stole their water rights and the sparkling water stopped,\\" plunging the tribe into poverty. The song then introduces Hayes, who volunteers for the U.S. Marine Corps (forgetting, in La Farge's words, \\"the white man's greed\\") and participates in the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima. When Hayes returns home, he faces discomfort and hostility. Even Americans' attempts to honor Hayes are treated with contempt in La Farge's lyrics (\\"they let him raise the flag and lower it, like you'd throw a dog a bone.\\").

The most popular version is by Johnny Cash, which he recorded for the Bitter Tears concept album (containing mostly La Farge compositions) and reached number three on the Billboard Country Singles chart in 1964. Patrick Sky covered it on his self-titled 1965 debut album (and later for a 1985 album). Hamilton Camp included the song on his 1969 album, Welcome to Hamilton Camp. Pete Seeger covered the song on his 1963 album Broadside Ballads Volume 2. Smiley Bates covered the song on his 1971 album Songs of Life. Bob Dylan followed suit by covering the song during his sessions for Self Portrait (released in 1970), though his version did not see release until Columbia used it as part of the Dylan album of 1973. On November 16, 1975, Dylan performed the song live at the Tuscarora Reservation, and this rendition appears on the 2019 box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings and in the 2019 film Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese. Townes Van Zandt covered this song during a rare television appearance, and at The Whole Coffeehouse, University of Minnesota Campus, November 9, 1973. Kinky Friedman did a cover of the song on his 1976 record Lasso from El Paso. The song was also covered by Hazel Dickens on her 1983 bluegrass album From the Sweat of my Brow. Kris Kristofferson sings the song on a tribute remake of Bitter Tears, released in 2014.

According to the Water Usage & Classification for Fresh Water system used by the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Class D Quality freshwater is suitable for agriculture, irrigation, livestock watering and industrial water supply class II. \\"Worse than Class D\\" implies that the Pangil River is not suitable for any of those functions. In 1980, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) researcher DA Vaughan documented six populations of Oryza minuta Presl. - a wild rice species known to be resistant to bacterial blight, bacterial blast, green planthopper, and brown planthopper - along a stream which is a tributary of the Pangil river. A 2004 survey noted with alarm that all the populations were gone. The report attributed the disappearance of the rare and useful species of rice to human activities, particularly \\"livestock raising, farming, and road construction, which destroy the natural vegetation within the vicinity.\\" Scientists have noted that further studies are needed to prevent the local extinction of this species.

Biography  Rosa Valetti was born in Berlin, the daughter of industrialist Felix Vallentin and sister of actor Hermann Vallentin. She played her first roles in the theatres of suburban Berlin. Inspired by the November Revolution and her meeting with political satirist Kurt Tucholsky, Valetti began performing in cabarets. In 1920, she founded the Caf√© Gr√∂ssenwahn (\\"Caf√© Megalomania\\"), which has been recognized as one of the most important literary and political cabarets in 1920s Berlin. Caf√© Megalomania was frequented by Expressionist writers, and the program of sketch comedy and political songs reflected Valetti's belief in the cabaret as an instrument of political and social criticism. The inflation of 1919 to 1923 and the subsequent collapse of the German economy forced Valetti to close Cafe Megalomania. She directed the cabaret Rakete for a time, then launched another cafe of her own, the Rampe, which hosted the works of revolutionist poet and singer Erich Weinert. Valetti was among the founders of the floating cabaret Larifari during the late 1920s. In 1928 she performed as Mrs. Peachum in the original cast of Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera, which was staged under the direction of Erich Engel at Berlin's Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. Rosa Valetti acted in film roles from 1911. Her age and sturdy mien ensured that she acted mostly in motherly roles, as in the 1925 film Die Prinzessin und der Geiger (The Princess and the Violinist), in which she played a 46-year-old grandmother. In Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel) she plays the wife of the magician, Kiepert (Kurt Gerron). Valetti also appears briefly in Fritz Lang's 1931 classic M as the proprietor of an underworld cafe. In 1933, Valetti went into exile, performing first in Vienna and Prague, then in Palestine in 1936. She married actor Ludwig Roth and had a daughter, the actress Lisl Valetti, with him. Rosa Valetti died in Vienna on 10 December 1937. She was buried at the Urnenhain. The grave existed until 2001. A street in Berlin's Mahlsdorf district is named \\"Rosa-Valetti-Strasse\\" in her honour.

In Northern Sami she is called Rana Neida and Rana Neide (names in other Sami languages are Rana Nieda, Ruona Neida, Radien-neide and Blende). Rana Niejta is the goddess for spring and fertility. The literal translation of the name Rana is ¬´the green¬ª or ¬´the green, fertile fields¬ª. The name Rana Niejta can freely be translated as ¬´the daughter of earth¬ª. According to Sami mythology, she made the mountains turned southwards green, so that hungry reindeer had enough food. Sala Niejta and Rana Niejta The Finnish linguist Otto Donner described in his translation of S√°mi poems into German and Finnish in 1876 how Sala Niejta \\"daughter of the Sun\\", Rana Niejta and Saivo Niejta \\"daughter of the underworld\\" often were mentioned together in sami poetry, and sometimes were confused with each other by outsiders without personal knowledge of S√°mi mythology: However, older sources from 1700 clearly shows that they are three different goddesses. Sala Niejta had the power to end the snow and the cold, while Rana Niejta made it possible for trees and herbs to grow and flourish anew every year.[Sckanke NS-2], p. 210 Rana Niejta thus represents the recreation of the spring. The Samis considered the Sun as Sala Niejta and Rana Niejta were two different goddesses, which, together with The municipality of Rana, Norway Bronze statue showing Rana Niejta in Mo i Rana Some also consider her name as the origin of the name of the municipality of Rana in Norway.

The statue was made by the artist Arne Durban, and financed by Den Norske Bank (DNB, ¬´The Norwegian Bank¬ª) in 1970 in connection with its 25-years anniversary. It was delivered to Rana municipality on November 19, 1970.

In 1977, he met up with Rinus Vreugdenhil and with various musicians, started Picture. By 1979, Jan Bechtum and Ronald van Prooijen had joined the band for their first stable (and the classic) lineup. He remained with the band through their Eternal Dark album, but had to leave for personal reasons, as the gruel of touring, their bad luck with management, and having to support a family took a toll. Laruens' influences included Carmine Appice, Vinnie Appice, John Bonham, Phil Rudd, and Cozy Powell. He used a Rogers Drums nine piece, double bass set and Paiste cymbals. In late 2007, Laurens and the original members of Picture, with Ronald van Prooijen, teamed up for a reunion rehearsal. It went so well that they decided to continue rehearsing for some concert dates, and considered recording a new album in early 2008 with Shmoulik Avigal from the Diamond Dreamer lineup as their singer.

It is known to occur in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi. The species has protected status as an endangered species in both Florida and Tennessee. These plants are smaller than most other species in the genus, usually no more than tall, with comparatively inconspicuous flowers and leaves. As implied by both scientific and common names, the (lanceolate) leaves are notably narrow, about 2.5 times as long as they are broad, with the widest portion being more-or-less central. The petals are usually maroon or brownish-maroon, quite erect, and more slender than in most other species of Trillium. Trillium lancifolium blooms from February to May. It typically occurs in shady upland hardwood forests, but can be found in various other communities with some shade. Populations are usually scattered, and the individual plants are often present at low population levels.

Built of sandstone in the early 19th century, it is a Grade II listed building. From the opposite side History In 1789 Robert Whitworth varied the route of the unfinished part of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, by building a new tunnel at Foulridge which lowered the summit level by 40 feet. He chose a more southerly route in Lancashire. This resulted in an Act of Parliament in 1790 which allowed further fund-raising for the completion. In 1794 another Act was granted authorising another change of route and yet more fund-raising. The new Foulridge Tunnel was proving difficult and expensive to dig, when it opened in 1796 it was 1,640 yards (1,500 m) long. This new route took the canal south via Burnley and Blackburn which was reached in 1810. This new route for this section of the canal meant it was now running parallel with and then crossing the isolated southern end of the Lancaster Canal. Common sense prevailed and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal connected with the Lancaster Canal between Wigan and Johnson's Hillock. The main line of the canal was thus completed in 1816.Heritage locations See also *Burnley Embankment References Category:Bridges in Lancashire Category:Buildings and structures in Blackburn Category:Canals in Blackburn with Darwen Category:Grade II listed buildings in Lancashire Category:Navigable aqueducts in England Category:Grade II listed bridges Category:Grade II listed canals ","title":"Ewood Aqueduct"},{"id":"13858717","text":"Frank Asch (born August 6, 1946 in Somerville, New Jersey) is an American children's book writer, best known for his Moonbear picture books.

The club, in its first inception, was founded in 1929 and has played many years at Serie C level, and currently plays in the regional amateur Promozione league of Sicily. History =The foundation= An ancestor of the club was known to have played since at least the early-1930s as Associazione Calcio Agrigento. The club had moderate success in the lower divisions of Italian football; it progressed beyond the regional Sicilian scene to Serie C for the first time in the 1939‚Äì40 season. By the late 1940s A.C. Agrigento had fallen in stature, competing in the regional Promozione Sicily league after being relegated; their decline fully set in 1952 when the club became defunct due to financial difficulties. =Revival as Akragas= Following the previous club's closure, Akragas was revamped and a new team was set up by chairman Enzo Lauretta during 1952. The club was renamed Unione Sportiva Akragas, rather than using the Italianized version of the name, the club paid homage to the city's Magna Graecia roots. A noted figure in Sicilian football, Carmelo Di Bella was put in place as the club's first manager, while Gaspare Gallo was its first captain. To attract the attention of the supporters of defunct Agrigento, Akragas changed its colour, abandoning its violet and taking the white and blue of Agrigento. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Akragas barely missed out on promotion to Lega Pro in favour of Savoia, but would go on to achieve this in the next season by winning Group I of the Serie D league. They began to play in the Lega Pro after the 2015‚Äì16 season. Club president Silvio Alessi announced on 13 July 2018, that the team did not register for the upcoming season of Serie D, to which it had been relegated, and the club had been placed in liquidation.

Amygdala is shown in purple. The basolateral amygdala (BLA), or basolateral complex, consists of the lateral, basal and accessory-basal nuclei of the amygdala. The lateral nuclei receives the majority of sensory information, which arrives directly from the temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and primary auditory cortex. The information is then processed by the basolateral complex and is sent as output to the central nucleus of the amygdala. This is how most emotional arousal is formed in mammals.Baars, B. J, Gage, N. M. (2010). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: introduction to cognitive neuroscience second edition. Academic Press. Burlington MA The basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens shell together mediate specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior. The primary function of the basolateral complex is stimulating fear response. The fear system is intended to avoid pain or injury. For this reason the responses must be quick, and reflex-like. To achieve this, the ‚Äúlow-road‚Äù or a bottom-up process is used to generate a response to stimuli that are potentially hazardous. The stimulus reaches the thalamus, and information is passed to the lateral nucleus, then the basolateral system, and immediately to the central nucleus where a response is then formed. There is no conscious cognition involved in these responses. Other non-threatening stimuli are processed via the ‚Äúhigh road‚Äù or a top-down form of processing.Breedlove, S., Watson, N. (2013). Biological Psychology: an introduction to behavioral cognitive, and clinical neuroscience Seventh edition. Sinauer Associates, inc. Sunderland: MA. In this case, the stimulus input reaches the sensory cortex first, leading to more conscious involvement in the response. In immediately threatening situations, the fight- or-flight response is reflexive, and conscious thought processing doesn‚Äôt occur until later.Smith, C., & Kirby, L., (2001). Toward delivering on the promise of appraisal theory. In K. R. Scherer, a. Schorr, & T. Johnstone (Eds.), Apraisal processes in emotion : Theory, methods, research. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. An important process that occurs in basolateral amygdala is consolidation of cued fear memory. One proposed molecular mechanism for this process is collaboration of M1-Muscarinic receptors, D5 receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors to redundantly activate phospholipase C, which inhibits the activity of KCNQ channels that conduct inhibitory M current. The neuron then becomes more excitable and the consolidation of memory is enhanced. The amygdala has several different nuclei and internal pathways; the basolateral complex (or basolateral amygdala), the central nucleus, and the cortical nucleus are the most well-known. Each of these has a unique function and purpose within the amygdala. References Category:Amygdala ","title":"Basolateral amygdala"},{"id":"13859061","text":"Materials from the S.C.

The Columbia Gazetteer of the World (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998) p. 828 History They were the only Chauhan rulers in the region and had settled there after being forced from Delhi by the invasion of Muhammad Ghori in the twelfth century AD. They were feudatories of the princely state of Bilaspur until 1815, when the English East India Company formally recognised the state as an independent entity with the issue of a sanad (deed). The recognition was granted as a consequence of the support offered by the rulers to the British in their successful attempt to remove Gurkha influence from the Shimla Hills in 1803‚Äì1815 when Dhami was occupied by Nepal. The Dhami ruler who had formulated this policy was Rana Govardhan Singh, who maintained his support through the Indian rebellion of 1857 and until his death in 1867. The tribute exacted from the state was halved after 1857 in recognition of this, with the privilege being granted for his lifetime. The successor to Govardhan Singh was Fateh Singh, his son, to whom the authorities of what was now the British Raj extended a similar concession with regard to the tribute from 1880. Fateh was in turn succeeded by his son, Hira Singh, in 1894 and the concession was granted once more. Hira was also made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in recognition of his support of the British cause during World War I. The last formally recognised Rana was Dalip Singh, who succeeded his father, Hira, in 1920 and died in 1987.

Life Topham was the son of a carpenter who apprenticed him to his own trade. In early life he was landlord of the Red Lion Inn, near old St. Luke's Hospital, and, though he failed there in business, soon gained profit and notoriety by his feats of strength. His first public exhibition consisted in pulling against a horse while lying on his back with his feet against the dwarf wall that divided Upper and Lower Moorfields. On 10 July 1734, a concert at Stationers' Hall, given for his benefit, was diversified by his herculean performances, and the woodcut on an extant programme (Burney Coll., Brit. Mus.) shows the strong man lying extended between two chairs, with a glass of wine in his right hand, and five gentlemen standing on his body. About this time, or later, he became landlord of the Duke's Head, a public-house in Cadd's Row (afterwards St. Alban's Place), near Islington Green.Warwick William Wroth, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 57, p.56 Topham exhibited in Ireland (April 1737) and Scotland, and at Macclesfield in Cheshire so impressed were the corporation by his feats that they gave him a purse of gold and made him a free burgess. At Derby he rolled up a pewter dish of seven pounds ‚Äòas a man rolls up a sheet of paper;‚Äô twisted a kitchen spit round the neck of a local ostler who had insulted him, and lifted Mr Chambers, the vicar of All Saints who weighed , with one hand. He could lie on two chairs with four people standing on his body, which (we are told) he 'heaved at pleasure.' He further entertained the company with the song of 'Mad Tom,' though in a voice ‚Äòmore terrible than sweet.‚Äô On 28 May 1741, to celebrate the taking of Porto Bello by Admiral Edward Vernon, he performed at the Apple Tree Inn, formerly opposite Coldbath Fields Prison, London, in the presence of the admiral and numerous spectators. Here, standing on a wooden stage, he raised several inches from the ground three hogsheads of water weighing , using for the purpose a strong rope and tackle passing over his shoulders. This performance is represented in an etching published by W. H. Toms in July 1741, from a drawing by C. Leigh.woodcut in Pink's Clerkenwell, p. 78 One night he is said to have carried a watchman in his box from Chiswell Street till he finally dropped his sleeping burden over the wall of Bunhill Fields burying-ground. Once, in the Hackney Road, he held back a horse and cart in spite of the driver's efforts to proceed. Dr. John Theophilus Desaguliers records, among other feats of Topham's witnessed by him, the bending of a large iron poker nearly to a right angle by striking it upon his bare left arm. Desaguliers helped to make Topham famous, as he would take Topham to perform at meetings of the Royal Society, employed him as a personal bodyguard while he travelled and encouraged Topham to perform at places they visited. In 1745, having left Islington, he was established as master of the Bell and Dragon, an inn in Hog Lane, St. Leonard's, Shoreditch. Here he exhibited for his usual charge of a shilling a head. A dish of hard pewter, rolled up by Topham on 3 April 1737, is preserved in the British Museum, and is marked with the names of Dr. Desaguliers and others who witnessed the performance. Cromwell, Islington, p. 245 Topham was about five feet ten inches tall and muscular, but he walked with a slight limp. He is said to have been usually of a mild disposition; but, excited to frenzy by the infidelity of his wife, he stabbed her and then wounded himself so severely that he died a few days afterwards at the Bell and Dragon on 10 August 1749. He was buried in the church of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch.

The additional climb rate is attained by reduction of horizontal speed. Before a zoom climb, the aircraft accelerates to a high air speed at an altitude at which it can operate in sustained level flight. The pilot then pulls steeply upward, trading the kinetic energy of forward motion for altitude. The aircraft gains potential energy (altitude) at the expense of kinetic energy (forward motion). This is different from a steady climb, where the increase in potential energy comes from mechanical work done by the engines, rather than from the aircraft's kinetic energy. Zoom climbs are somewhat commonly performed by modern fighter aircraft. Typically referred to as an \\"unrestricted climb\\", pilots will take off and accelerate to a high speed near the ground and then pull the aircraft vertically or nearly vertical in order to quickly climb up to the aircraft's cruising altitude. In a demonstration of their performance, English Electric Lightning fighter aircraft have sometimes used zoom climbs to climb above a Lockheed U-2 (which cruises at an altitude above the Lightning's service ceiling), before pouncing on it from above. Zoom climbs have been used to test new aircraft designs and conduct research in different flight regimes.Zoom Climb, Air Force Magazine 88 (February 2005) During the proving phase of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, on December 6, 1959, an early version of the aircraft (the XF4H-1) performed a zoom climb to 98,557 feet (30,040 m) as part of Operation \\"Top Flight\\". The previous record of 94,658 feet (28,852 m) was set by a Soviet Sukhoi T-43-1 prototype. Commander Lawrence E. Flint Jr. accelerated his aircraft to Mach 2.5 at 47,000 feet (14,330 m) and climbed to 90,000 feet (27,430 m) at a 45-degree angle. He then shut down the engines and glided to the peak altitude. As the aircraft fell through 70,000 feet (21,300 m), Flint restarted the engines and resumed normal flight. An NF-104A Starfighter fitted with an additional rocket engine was also regularly used in zoom-climb research for future spaceflight. On May 7, 1958, the aircraft reached an altitude of 91,249 feet (27.81 km) in a zoom climb at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., setting a new altitude record. The Mach 2 mission took the airplane so high that the standard F-104's jet engine routinely exceeded its temperature limit and had to be shut down. Sometimes the engine simply flamed out for lack of air. Then the pilot steered the aircraft like a returning spaceship to a lower altitude, where he would restart the engine. It was on one such \\"zoom climb\\" flight that test pilot Chuck Yeager was nearly killed flying a heavily modified F-104 on December 10, 1963. On 25 July 1973, A. Fedotov reached 35,230 m (115,600 feet) in a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 with 1,000 kg payload, and 36,240 m (118,900 feet) with no load (an absolute world record).Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 392.FAI Record . In the thin air, the engines flamed out and the aircraft coasted in a ballistic trajectory by inertia alone. At the apex the Indicated airspeed (IAS) had dropped to 75 km/h. Without engine power, the cockpit would depressurize on these missions. Consequently, for protection against the rarified atmosphere, the pilot wore a full-body pressure suit. Properly outfitted with an airtight helmet and suit, the pilot received breathing oxygen without ill effects.

In the Cherokee language, Nunnehi literally means \\"The People Who Live Anywhere\\", but it is often translated into English as \\"The People Who Live Forever\\", or simply \\"The Immortals\\". The Cherokee believed the Nunnehi to be a type of supernatural human being, completely distinct from ghosts and nature spirits, as well as from gods. In this sense, the Nunnehi (along with the Yunwi Tsunsdi, or \\"Little People\\" in the Cherokee language) are the Cherokee equivalent of fairies in traditional European folklore. The belief in fairy- like beings is universal among all ethnicities, including all American Indian tribes. According to Cherokee folklore, the Nunnehi had many underground townhouses throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains, and they were particularly fond of high mountain peaks where no timber ever grew. Hunters would often hear the Nunnehi in the mountains, singing and dancing and beating drums, but when they would go toward the sound, it would shift about and suddenly seem to be coming from behind them or from some other direction, so that the person hearing the sound would never be able to find where it was coming from.  The Dance at Nottely  The Nunnehi only appeared to humans when they allowed themselves to be seen. When they did appear, they looked and acted just like other Cherokee. The Nunnehi were very fond of music and dancing, as are the Cherokee. One of the stories about the Nunnehi tells about four Nunnehi women who came to a town called Nottely and danced with the young men there for hours. Nobody knew that they were Nunnehi women; everyone thought they were just women from another village or town. As the women were leaving the dance, a group of men standing outside the townhouse watched the women walk down an open trail to the Nottely River. When the women reached the river they suddenly disappeared, with no apparent hiding place. It was then that the men realized that the women were Nunnehi.  Yahula  The Nunnehi were very friendly to the Cherokee and often helped lost wanderers, especially during the winter. The Nunnehi would take the person into their warm townhouses until the person was rested and ready to return home, if the person chose to do so. A well-known story tells about a man named Yahula, who had become separated from a hunting party. His friends searched for him for a long time but eventually gave up and returned to their village, grieving for Yahula, whom they believed was dead. The Nunnehi found Yahula and brought him back to their townhouse to live with them. Yahula became immortal and lived with the Nunnehi for a long time until he began to miss his friends and family. One night Yahula went back to his village to see his friends and family, and he told them what had happened. When they asked Yahula to eat dinner with them, he said he could not, for he had eaten the food of the Nunnehi and could never again eat human food. He told them he had only come back to visit and that he would soon be returning to the Nunnehi. His friends and family begged him to stay, but he refused, telling them he could not choose death with his own people over immortality with the Nunnehi. Yahula then returned to the Nunnehi, but he continued to visit the Cherokee often.  The Nunnehi Protect the Cherokee Before the Removal in 1838  The Nunnehi often warned the Cherokee of impending danger and protected them in times of need. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells how they helped the Cherokee before the Removal in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in Oklahoma. According to the story, the Nunnehi came to a Cherokee village and told the people to pack up their belongings and to be prepared to leave in seven days to come live with the Nunnehi, for a great catastrophe was about to happen, worse than anything that had ever before happened to the Cherokee. After seven days, the Nunnehi returned for the Cherokee and led them to a large stone deep into the mountains. As the Cherokee watched, the stone rolled away, revealing an entrance into the mountain. Inside the mountain was the most beautiful place the Cherokee had ever seen, and many families rushed into the mountain without ever looking back. However, some of the people refused to enter, and instead chose to stay outside and face whatever was about to happen to them. The people who remained outside were later forced to leave their homes and resettle in Oklahoma. The people who chose to live with the Nunnehi escaped the fate of their fellow Cherokee. According to the story, it is from this group of Cherokee that the small number of modern Cherokee who still live on their native land is descended.  The Removed Townhouse  There are also other similar stories that tell about how the Nunnehi invited Cherokee people to come live with them in order to avoid war and misfortune. One well-known story tells about a time long before the time of the Removal, when the Nunnehi told a group of Cherokee that they would return in seven days to carry away the townhouse along with anyone inside it. The Nunnehi warned the people not to shout or make any sound as the townhouse was being carried away. On the seventh day there was a sound like thunder that grew louder and louder as it approached the village. Despite the Nunnehi's warning to the Cherokee to remain quiet, some of the people became frightened and screamed when the ground began to shake as the Nunnehi lifted the townhouse off the ground. Some of the Nunnehi were startled by the scream and dropped a part of the townhouse, which fell to the ground and became the mound at a village called Setsi. The Nunnehi steadied themselves and carried off the remaining part of the townhouse, with the people still in it, to a mountain called Lone Peak, where it was changed to solid rock and the people inside it became invisible and immortal like the Nunnehi.  The Nunnehi of Hiwassee River  In another story, the Nunnehi invited a group of Cherokee to come live with them, and after the seven days had passed, they returned and took the people to live with them underneath Hiwassee River, near the area where Shooting Creek comes in. The Cherokee who went to live with the Nunnehi under the river would sometimes catch the fish-drags of their kinsmen because they did not want to be forgotten. On warm summer days, when the wind ripples the surface of the water, their voices could sometimes be heard by those floating by on the river.  The Nunnehi Warriors of Nikwasi  The Nunnehi sometimes assisted the Cherokee in times of war. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells about how they fought alongside the Cherokee when their land was invaded by a powerful, unknown tribe of American Indians from the southeast. Nikwasi was the most ancient settlement of the Cherokee, and the invading tribe attacked Nikwasi one morning just before daybreak. The warriors of Nikwasi fought back but were eventually overpowered. A stranger then appeared and told the Nikwasi chief to retreat and that he himself would fight the enemy. The chief did as he was instructed, believing the stranger to be a chief from another village who had come with reinforcements. The mound at Nikwasi then opened up and hundreds of Nunnehi warriors poured out and began to approach the battlefield. When the Nunnehi warriors reached the invading tribe they became invisible and slaughtered all but a few who had surrendered and begged for mercy. The Nunnehi told the invading tribe that they got what they deserved for attacking a peaceful tribe, and then sent them back to where they came from so they could deliver the news to their people and warn them to never again attack Nikwasi.  The Nunnehi Defend Franklin, North Carolina  During the American Civil War, by which time Nikwasi had become known as Franklin, North Carolina, a group of Union soldiers approached Franklin with the intention of burning it to the ground. A group of scouts returned to their commanding officers and warned them not to attack the town because it was heavily guarded by soldiers on every corner. However, the town was defenseless, as every able-bodied person had already left to fight in the war. Unaware of this fact, the Union soldiers then changed their course toward Atlanta, Georgia, burning every town in their path. According to the Cherokee, it was the Nunnehi that had protected Franklin from the Union soldiers.  The Abandoned Nunnehi Townhouse  There is a story that tells about how some of the Nunnehi eventually decided to leave their home. Near the Cherokee town of Tugaloo there was a circular depression in the ground, the size of a townhouse. The inside of the depression was waist-deep and was always clean as though it had been cared for by unknown hands. Travelers passing by would often throw rocks and logs into the depression, but when they returned the logs and rocks would always be lying far from the depression. The Cherokee believed the place to be a Nunnehi townhouse, and so they always avoided the place out of respect. Eventually, some logs had been thrown into the depression and were allowed to remain there, and the Cherokee concluded that the Nunnehi had become annoyed by the presence of the white men and had abandoned their townhouse forever.  The Nunnehi in Cherokee Folklore After The Removal in 1838  After the Removal in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in Oklahoma, one of their greatest regrets was that they were forced to leave behind forever their relatives who had gone to live with the Nunnehi. Storytelling always has been and is still an important tradition in Cherokee culture, and the Nunnehi remain a popular subject of many stories. There are even some Cherokee still living in their native land that claim to have had encounters with the Nunnehi.

Whitesand Bay, on some maps, located west of St. Davids and south of St Davids Head, has been described as the best surfing beach in Pembrokeshire. Description Carn Llidi The area northeast of the wide, sandy bay is dominated by Carn Llidi, a rocky outcrop, at its highest point. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path provides access on foot in the north to the secluded bays of Porthlleuog and Porthmelgan. To the south, the coastal path leads to Porthselau and St. Justinian's, with views of Ramsey Island. A number of megalithic burial chambers, stone hut circles and Iron Age field systems and enclosures are in the vicinity of Carn Llidi and St Davids Head. There is a tradition that St. Patrick set sail from this beach in 432 AD to convert Ireland to Christianity. The site of a Celtic chapel, dedicated to St Patrick, is located under a mound by the car park just to the east of the bay, at what is thought to have been the disembarkation point for pilgrims to St Davids Cathedral. St David may have been educated at Ty Gwyn, the white farmhouse that overlooks the beach, by St Paulinus, and St Non, David's mother, may have lived here when it was a monastery. At very low tide and after heavy storms the remains of an ancient, submerged forest can be seen on the beach, consisting of stumps of birch, fir, hazel and oak trees. The remains of animals have also been found in these deposits, including parts of an aurochs, a red deer antler and a brown bear jaw.

His career began at the age of 18 with his first solo exhibition in Buenos Aires, where he still lives and works.  Influences and early work  Prior cites Argentine artist Juan Del Prete as one of his predecessors. He was also strongly influenced by themes from his university studies in oriental arts and literature. Very early in his life, Prior bet on romantic and hallucinogen painting. Whilst Jorge Romero Brest, the influential Buenos Aires art critic of the sixties and seventies, had declared the death of painting, Prior devoted eight years of work to mastering the medium. After his first exhibition, in the Lirolay Gallery in 1970, where he presented 28 portraits of children made with tempera and wax, Prior began working on new abstract series, in which he used sheets of crumpled tracing paper as the supports. He outlined different geometries using synthetic enamel. The most successful example of these series is A la Manera de Aru Dutt (\\"In the style of Aru Dutt\\"), 1974. After the seventies, Prior reappeared with a retrospective self anthology exhibition.  Collaboration with other artists  In 1981 he presented a joint exhibition with Armando Rearte at Arte M√∫ltiple Gallery, going on to form a collective with fellow artists Armando Rearte, Rafael Bueno, Guillermo Kuitca and Osvaldo Monz√≥. 1982 was a key year for the group, as they all participated in La Anavanguardia, a project curated by art critic Charlie Espartaco. In 1983 Prior participated in La \\"Consagraci√≥n de la Primavera\\", an exhibition curated by Laura Buccelato and Charlie Espartaco, at Espacio Giesso. Armando Rearte, Osvaldo Monzo, Guillermo Kuitca and Prior took part in the exhibition of paintings produced by the artists working together. This exhibition marked a change in direction for Prior, as he began working with different artists and groups than previously. Prior took up residence in a basement at 959 Riobamba Street, a collective workshop, exhibition space and occasional cabaret, called \\"La Zona\\", where he would remain for three years. At the same time, Sergio Avello (born in 1964) and other artists of his generation grouped together and held several exhibitions at La Zona. By 1984, after his third exhibition, Prior's personal canon, his private history of arts which ruled the political decisions of his imaginary, was already perfectly defined. Prior was invited to exhibit at the 18th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, one of many exhibitions he took part in in 1985. The poet and critic Edward Lucie-Smith took interest in Prior's work during the Biennial and contacted him in Buenos Aires. The installation that Guillermo Kuitca and Prior presented at Fundaci√≥n San Telmo in 1985 marked the end of Prior's greatest spontaneous collaboration with other artists, and would be the last time they worked together. A few months later Prior released the first of his Napoleonic sagas and the first chapters of his Chinese Encyclopedia, two-thirds of his monumental system of systems, almost simultaneously. He wanted from the very beginning, to reformulate historical painting choosing Napoleon for his condition of archetypical character and the popular representation of madness, a man characterized like Napoleon. He later established the relation Insane=Napoleon=Artist, for there is a deep rooted tradition about the image of the artist being very close to a dark zone.  International exhibitions  In 1988 he exhibited at the Beau L√©zard of Paris, at the Moderna Museum of Stockholm, at the Terne Gallery of New York during a tribute to Roland Barthes, and at the newly opened Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute (ICI). From 1989 to 1992 he exhibited his works in New York City, S√£o Paulo, Madrid, Mar del Plata (Argentina), Mexico DF., Buenos Aires, Cali (Colombia), Rio de Janeiro, Nagoya (Japan), Medell√≠n (Colombia), London and Ankara (Turkey). In 1993, Prior proposed an exhibition simultaneously composed of eight heteronyms, judged by critics to be openly making fun of all traditional conceptualist and neo-conceptualist practices.  Exhibitions  Prior's first solo exhibition at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes took place in 1998. His solo presentations had been adapted to the space of each gallery and from this exhibition on, Prior let each museum interfere with his work. In this way, the public and validating space of the institution could become a support for his art, increasing the possibilities of his own resources. Starting at the Museo Nacional, he continued at the Museo Larreta. He would then exhibit in the Sala Cronopios of the Centro Cultural Recoleta and the Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n Gallery, in La Boca. He later held a retrospective at Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno. In March 2003 he presented his most prestigious exhibition at the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, featuring pieces from throughout his career: the Osarios series (1982/1984), works in collaboration with Kuitca, Rearte and Monzo (1983), Bears and Rabbits series (1986), Chinese Hairstyles and Scenes at a Chinese Restaurant from the Stone Age (both 1987), as well as Sweeping fallen leaves (1991), Aru Dut's Way (1974) and Complete Chinese Operas (1999). In 2004, he reformulated all the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci for his second solo exhibition at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes. Prior improvised Da Vinci and chose the name \\"The War of Styles\\" for his \\"Davincian Orchestration\\", rebuilding the studies of the artist's lost fresco The Battle of Anghiari. That same year he exhibited in Los Angeles with Kevin Power as curator. He has held annual solo exhibitions at his current Buenos Aires gallery Vasari for the past years.

In baseball, the uniform number is a number worn on the uniform of each player and coach. Numbers are used for the purpose of easily identifying each person on the field as no two people from the same team can wear the same number. Although designed for identification purposes only, numbers have become the source of superstition, emotional attachment, and honor (in the form of a number retirement). The number is always on the back of the jersey, often on the front, and occasionally seen on the left leg of the pants or on the uniform sleeve. According to common tradition, single-digit numbers are worn by position players but rarely by pitchers, and numbers 60 and higher are rarely worn at all. Higher numbers are worn during spring training by players whose place on the team is uncertain, and sometimes are worn during the regular season by players recently called up from the minor leagues; however, such players usually change to a more traditional number once it becomes clear that they will stay with the team. However, this tradition is not enforced by any rule,2018 Official Rules on MLB.com, and exceptions are common. Examples include stars Kenley Jansen (#74) and Aaron Judge (#99). The first notable player to wear a number above 60 was Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk, who wore #72 with the Chicago White Sox from 1981-93. Number 72 was the reverse of the #27 he wore from 1971-80 with the Boston Red Sox, where he was the 1972 American League Rookie of the Year. At the other end of the number line, Blake Snell (who wears #4) in 2018 became the first pitcher wearing a single-digit number to appear in the All-Star Game and the first to win the Cy Young Award. History Jos√© M√©ndez of the Cuban Stars, seen with a uniform number on his left sleeve during a game in Chicago (1909) Rumor has it that the uniform number first appeared in the 19th century, but the earliest official record is from 1907, when the Reading Red Roses of the Atlantic League numbered its players' jerseys in an effort to help the fans identify them. While it is unknown if the team ever took the field with numbers, it did mark the beginning of the idea of uniform numbers. The uniform number appeared on the jerseys of the Cuban Stars, a traveling team of the early 1900s, in 1909. In an issue of the Chicago Daily News, star pitcher Jos√© M√©ndez is seen wearing the number 12 on his left sleeve. Players of the Cleveland Indians wearing uniforms with numbers on their left sleeves in 1916. The Indians were the first team to introduce numbered uniforms in the MLB The first time a Major League team wore numbers was on June 26, 1916. Inspired by football's and hockey's use of numbers, the Cleveland Indians trotted on their home field wearing large numbers on their left sleeves. This \\"experiment\\" was tried for a few weeks, again the next season, and then abandoned. In 1923, the St. Louis Cardinals adopted uniform numbers on their sleeves. However, as then-manager Branch Rickey recalled, the Cardinals' players were \\"subjected to field criticism from the stands and especially from opposing players,\\" so the numbers were removed. At this time, the Indianapolis ABC's of the Negro National League and the San Antonio Bears of the Texas League also tried out numbers. In 1929, the New York Yankees were planning to start the season with uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. The Indians also planned to wear numbers in this fashion. The Yankees were rained out on opening day, April 16, while the Indians played, making Cleveland the first MLB franchise to wear numbers on the back. The Yankees debuted their numbered jerseys two days after, April 18.Uni Watch: Who needs uniform numbers? By the mid-1930s, all MLB teams wore numbers; in 1937 the Philadelphia Athletics finally began wearing numbers on both home and away jerseys, making numbers a universal trait in the MLB. The first MLB game to feature both teams wearing numbers on their jerseys was the game between the Indians and the Yankees on May 13, 1929. =Numbers on other spots of the uniform= In 1951, the Springfield Cubs of the International League pioneered the look of having numbers on the front of the jersey. A year later, the Brooklyn Dodgers incorporated the idea into MLB. They had intended numbers-on-front to be first used in their 1951 World Series appearance, an event which did not occur because of Bobby Thomson's walk-off home run in the last game of the tiebreaker series between the Dodgers and the Giants. Today, numbers on the front are very common at all levels of play. In 1940, the Memphis Red Sox of the Negro American League wore numbers on their pants leg; the idea didn't catch on in MLB until the 1975-78 Astros wore numbers on their front left hip. The Chicago White Sox also wore left hip numbers from 1982-89. Today, the Philadelphia Phillies are the only Major League team to wear a number on the sleeve of their jerseys. The White Sox did so from 1971-75, and the St. Louis Cardinals did in 1979 and '80. Rules about numbers The official rules of baseball state that uniforms must be identical for all members of a team. The only mention of uniform number is that it must be on the back and a minimum of six inches tall. Each player must have their own unique number, but there is no rule requiring coaches to have unique numbers. For example, in 2015, Alan Trammell (who wore number 3 for his lengthy career as a Detroit Tigers player and manager) returned to coach first base and wore 3 again, despite the number belonging to Ian Kinsler at the time, marking a rare instance of a coach sharing a number with a player. =Deviations from the rules= In their first career games, Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis and Chicago White Sox pitcher Joe Horlen did not have jersey numbers. Both of these players were just called up to the big league team while it was on the road and the only uniform available had no number. On September 27, 1999, Detroit Tigers center fielder Gabe Kapler took the field donning a numberless uniform. That day, the Tigers played their last game at historic Tiger Stadium and, in honor of great Tigers of the past, members of the starting lineup wore the uniform numbers of corresponding members of an All-Time Detroit Tigers team voted on by the fans. Since Kapler played center field, he was to wear Ty Cobb's uniform number, but since Cobb played before numbers were used, Kapler's back was blank. For the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park on April 20, 2012, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees wore 1912-style uniforms which had no numbers. On Jackie Robinson Day, teams across the MLB all wear uniform number 42 to honor him. [See \\"Retired numbers,\\" below.] The MLB has taken this tribute so far that, on that day only, all 30 team websites' active rosters say that every player on the team is number 42. On August 21, 2012, the Boston Red Sox played their first home game since the death of Johnny Pesky, and all players wore his retired number 6 jersey during the game. On September 26, 2016, the Miami Marlins played their first home game since the death of Jose Fernandez, and all players wore his number 16 jersey during the game. On July 12, 2019, the Angels played their first home game since the death of Tyler Skaggs, and all players wore his number 45 jersey during the game. After the game, the players removed their Skaggs jerseys and laid them around the mound to honor his memory. Number assignments The original baseball numbers were based on the lineup. The starting players would be numbered 1-8, based on their spot in the order. The backup catcher would be number 9, and the pitchers would wear 10-14 (but not 13, as that is superstitious). Notable examples of this system are teammates Babe Ruth (he was number 3 and batted third for the Yankees) and Lou Gehrig (number 4, batted fourth). =Experiments with numbers by position= Several teams experimented with numbering-by-position during the 1930s. In , the Cincinnati Reds, under general manager Warren Giles, introduced what would be the longest-lasting convention, in which pitchers wore numbers between 30 and 49; outfielders between 20 and 29; infielders between 10 and 19; and catchers, coaches and managers in the single digits. (An exception occurred in the early 1950s, when the Reds' coaches and managers were assigned numbers in the fifties.)UniWatch.com 2011.01.04 The New York Giants adopted this system in 1947, and when Giles became chief executive of the National League in 1952, many other NL clubs began to follow suit. Two American League teams, the first edition of the expansion Los Angeles Angels and the Cleveland Indians beginning in 1963, also adopted the numbering scheme. In his memoir, Ball Four, pitcher Jim Bouton tells how he asked his new NL team, the Houston Astros, for his traditional number 56, but was assigned 44 instead because of the numbering custom. Bouton wrote: \\"I asked if there was any chance I could get 56. [The equipment manager] said he didn't think so, that all our pitchers have numbers in the 30s and 40s. He said I'd have to talk to [general manager Spec] Richardson or manager Harry Walker if I wanted to change the rule. I said I was sure they wouldn't want to be bothered with something so small, and he said, 'Oh, you'd be surprised.' Oh no I wouldn't.\\"Bouton, Jim, Ball Four. New York and Cleveland, The World Publishing Company, 1970, page 327. However, the number-by-position convention was never a formal rule, and a few National League clubs ‚Äî notably the Los Angeles Dodgers ‚Äî resisted the idea. The custom was slowly abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s. (In fact, in 1970, the Astros assigned Bouton his traditional number 56.) =Contemporary numbering conventions= Today teams do not assign numbers based on any system; personal preference combined with retired numbers has made it impossible. However, a few trends do present themselves quite clearly: Infielders, especially shortstops and second basemen, tend to be the players who would wear single digit numbers. Single digit numbers, however, are not rare for outfielders or catchers. * Numbers 1 through 14 are usually only worn by position players, while numbers 50 and above are more likely to be worn by pitchers. Numbers 60 and above have, historically, been rarely worn in the regular season. During spring training, such high numbers are often given to players who are unlikely to make the regular-season team. It is generally thought that the higher the number, the less chance of making the team. In recent years, higher numbers have appeared more frequently: the 2018 Boston Red Sox had ten players appear during the regular season with numbers in the 60s or 70s, and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees has worn number 99 since 2016. Pitcher Alan Mills briefly wore number 69 with the Yankees and wore number 75 with the Baltimore Orioles and later in his career as a coach. He preferred to wear high numbers to keep himself from getting complacent with his job, by reminding himself of the lack of job security of a spring training player.https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/uniform-numbers-69-nationals- aj-cole-bronson-arroyo-alan-mills-jordy-mercer-eric-fryer-peter- munro/w4hww96ogi821es8gugiguijo * The number 44 has been worn by many \\"power hitters\\" since Hank Aaron's career as home run king (Aaron was number 44). Other notable examples include Willie McCovey, Reggie Jackson, Adam Dunn, Anthony Rizzo, and Paul Goldschmidt. * Number 49 is traditionally sought out by knuckleball throwing pitchers: notable examples include Hoyt Wilhelm, Charlie Hough, Tim Wakefield, and Tom Candiotti. * In Nippon Professional Baseball, the Japanese big leagues, the number 18 is often reserved for the ace pitcher.GRACZYK, WAYNE. \\"Flood of retired numbers can lessen significance,\\" Japan Times (Feb. 28, 2015). Upon arriving in the MLB, Japanese \\"import\\" pitchers have sought the number again (including Hiroki Kuroda, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Hisashi Iwakuma, Kenta Maeda, and Yusei Kikuchi). * Numbers 0 and 00 are uncommon, but have been used by several players. Junior Ortiz wore 0 for five years of his thirteen-year career because his last name starts with \\"O\\". Al Oliver wore 0 for the last 8 years of his career for the same reason, and in 1985, Oliver's teammate Cliff Johnson wore 00 at the same time. Outfielder Oddibe McDowell also wore 0 because of his first name while with the 1980s Texas Rangers. In the 1990s, Jack Clark of the San Diego Padres and Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants both wore 00. Outfielder Terry McDaniel wore 0 during a brief stint with the New York Mets in 1991. Also in the 1990s, Omar Olivares wore 00 with the Cardinals and Phillies to represent his initials of O.O. Mets shortstop Rey Ord√≥√±ez wore 0 in 1996 and 1997 before switching to 10. Journeyman Tony Clark wore 00 with the Mets for the first two months of the 2003 season before switching to 52. While with the Washington Nationals and Cincinnati Reds from 2005‚Äì2007, outfielder Brandon Watson wore 00. Starting in the 2013 season, Adam Ottavino switched his number from 47 to 0, and when he was signed by the New York Yankees in the 2019 offseason, he became the first Yankee ever to be issued 0. Also in 2013, Brian Wilson took on 00 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2014, Omar Quintanilla of the New York Mets switched his number from 3 to 0 for outfielder Curtis Granderson. Also in 2014, Brennan Boesch and Collin Cowgill took on the numbers 00 and 0, respectively, for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Again in 2014, outfielder L. J. Hoes of the Houston Astros wore 0. Currently, Ottavino and Mallex Smith, with the Seattle Mariners, wear 0; Terrance Gore also wore 0 early in the 2019 season with the Kansas City Royals, but is not currently on an MLB roster. In total, 21 players have worn 0, and 20 players have worn 00 in their careers. * Numbers 01 through 09 (with a leading zero) are some of the rarest numbers that have been worn. Benito Santiago wore 09 for the San Diego Padres and Florida Marlins.Benito Santiago entry, Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed Aug. 27, 2016. He did it so the single-digit \\"real\\" number on his back would be easily distinguishable while wearing his catching gear.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73T4xLvHS5s A 2019 story by ESPN.com journalist Joon Lee discussed how players in the modern game have departed from traditional numbering conventions. Number choices are increasingly becoming a form of self-expression. Boston Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts wears 2 as a homage to his childhood hero Derek Jeter. The aforementioned Blake Snell wears 4 as a nod to his birthday of December 4. Another starting pitcher, Marcus Stroman, has worn either 6 or 7 for almost all of his MLB career, wearing 6 during most of his tenure with the Toronto Blue Jays and 7 with his current team, the New York Mets. The 6 is a tribute to his late grandmother's birthday. Stroman took 7 when he was traded to the Mets during the 2019 season because 6 was taken, mirroring his college career at Duke University, where he wore 7 for the same reason. Another notable single-digit pitcher in today's game is Mike Leake, who has worn 8, his number at Arizona State University, throughout his MLB career, first with the St. Louis Cardinals and now with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Kenley Jansen, also previously mentioned, wears 74 as a call-back to his childhood street address in Cura√ßao. In the story, Paul Lukas, who founded ESPN.com's Uni Watch feature and has since moved to Sports Illustrated, noted that the increasing use of higher numbers in baseball could be traced to the iconic status of certain high numbers in hockey, most notably Wayne Gretzky's 99 and Mario Lemieux's 66. At the time the story was written, nearly four times as many players had worn 99 in the 21st century (15) than in all of the 20th century (4), and nearly as many players had worn 0 in the 21st century (10) as in the 20th (11). No two-digit numbers remained unissued by any MLB team. The number 89 was issued but as of 8/20/20 it has yet to appear in a game. Superstitions, attachments, and gimmicks Often players grow emotionally attached to a number. When a player switches teams, his number is often already in use. Since the MLB allows number changes at any time, bribes may occur for numbers. Among the most outrageous are when Brian Jordan joined the Atlanta Braves and gave then-third base coach Fredi Gonz√°lez a $40,000 motorcycle for #33, and when Rickey Henderson joined the Toronto Blue Jays and paid Turner Ward $25,000 for Henderson's long-time career #24. Not every player pays top dollar for his number; when Mitch Williams joined the Philadelphia Phillies, he bought #28 from John Kruk for $10 and two cases of beer. The following season, Williams would change his number to #99 after Rick \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn, the character in the 1989 film, Major League, whose erratic pitching style resembled his own. In 1951, independent ball player Johnny Neves wore the number 7 backwards because \\"Neves\\" spelled backwards is \\"seven\\". Bill Voiselle, who is from Ninety Six, South Carolina, wore #96 from 1947‚Äì1950 to honor his hometown. Carlos May, who was born on May 17, wore number 17, meaning that his jersey read both his name and number and his birthday (\\"May 17\\"). Some players who are unable to acquire the number they had on their previous team will obtain a similar number. For example, Roger Clemens wore #21 during the first 15 years of his career with the Red Sox and Blue Jays and during his college days at the University of Texas. When he joined the Yankees and the Houston Astros, he switched to #22. Upon Clemens' arrival in New York, he reportedly asked long-time Yankee outfielder Paul O'Neill to surrender his #21, but O'Neill refused. Though he would eventually opt for #22, Clemens initially reversed his beloved #21, and wore #12. Clemens continued to wear #22 upon signing with his hometown Astros in 2004 and, upon re-signing with the Yankees, Robinson Can√≥, owner of #22 at the beginning of the 2007 season, moved to #24 in anticipation of the Yankees possibly re-signing Clemens, leaving #22 available for Clemens. Joe Beimel has worn #97 throughout his career because his first child was born in 1997. David Wells wore #3 while with the Red Sox because his favorite player, Babe Ruth, wore #3. When he played with the Yankees, Wells could not have #3 (retired for Babe Ruth), so he wore #33. In his final season, playing for the Red Sox, J. T. Snow wore #84 to honor his father Jack, a former NFL wide receiver. Eddie Gaedel, the dwarf who made one plate appearance for the St. Louis Browns, wore the number ‚Öõ. The uniform belonged to the young son of Browns executive Bill DeWitt. The boy, William DeWitt Jr., was then the team's batboy; he is now the principal owner of the St. Louis Cardinals.ESPN.com Baseball Hall of Fame manager Joe McCarthy never wore a digit on the back of his uniform with the Yankees (1931‚Äì1946) and Red Sox (1948‚Äì1950), despite managing during the era when numbers became widespread in Major League Baseball. Joe Girardi, in his managerial role with the Yankees, wore #27 to signify his desire to lead the team to their 27th championship.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3085167 After winning the 2009 World Series, he subsequently switched to #28. Retired numbers In 1939, Lou Gehrig's #4 (here displayed at Yankee Stadium) become the first number to be retired in the history of the MLB The most legendary players, managers, or coaches on a team will sometimes have their uniform number retired, so that future players and coaches cannot wear those numbers with that team. Only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. Generally, such retirements are reserved for the very best, who in most cases, have impacted the entire league, and are most memorable. The first Major League Baseball player to have his number retired was Lou Gehrig (#4). #4 and #5 have each been retired by eight teams, more than any other number (excluding Jackie Robinson's #42, which was retired throughout MLB, see below). The highest player uniform number to be retired was Carlton Fisk's #72, but the Cardinals retired #85 in honor of their one-time owner August Busch Jr. Though he never wore a uniform, that is how old he was at the time of the honor. The Cleveland Indians retired the #455 in 2001 in honor of \\"the fans\\", to commemorate the then-longest home sellout streak ever (although MLB does not allow any team to issue three-digit uniform numbers). Eight players and one manager, Casey Stengel, have had their numbers retired with more than one team. Nolan Ryan had two different numbers (#30 and #34) retired among three different teams. Fisk's #27 from the Red Sox and #72 from the White Sox are both retired, as are Reggie Jackson's #9 and #44, respectively, by the A's and Yankees. The New York Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team (19 numbers for 20 players), including all non-zero single digit numbers, meaning that many Yankees players get higher numbers because there aren't enough low numbers left. The Toronto Blue Jays traditionally had not retired numbers, but have an alternative method of honoring their players called the 'Level of Excellence'. They did retire Roberto Alomar's number #12 in 2011, due to him being inducted into the Hall of Fame. They later retired number #32 in honor of Roy Halladay, after his death. They also added him to the Level of Excellence. On August 6, 2016 the Seattle Mariners retired #24 throughout the organization in honor of Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the first Mariners player to have his number retired. =Jackie Robinson and number 42= Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers wearing a uniform with his distinctive #42 in 1954 In 1997, Major League Baseball, for the first time ever, made a Major League-wide retirement of a number. Number 42 cannot be issued to any new players, having been retired in honor of Jackie Robinson, although all players who currently wore the number upon the mass retirement of #42, such as Mo Vaughn and Butch Huskey of the Red Sox and Mets, were allowed to keep it under a grandfather clause. The clause also permitted such players who changed teams after the retirement date to retain #42 with their new team if it was available; thus, Vaughn (Red Sox, Angels, and Mets), Mike Jackson (Indians and Twins), and Jos√© Lima (Astros and Tigers) became the last players to wear the number #42 with multiple teams. With the retirement of Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees following the 2013 season, no MLB player currently wears #42 regularly. Art Silber, owner and coach of the Nationals' Class-A Affiliate Potomac, wears the number 42 as well. The Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Robinson played (as a Brooklyn Dodger), had already retired the number in 1972 before Robinson's death. However, the #42 would be worn by a number of players other than Rivera in 2007, which marked the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first appearance in Major League Baseball (the event that broke the sport's 20th-century color line). Before the season, then- Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. asked Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig for permission to wear #42 on April 15, the anniversary date of Robinson's historic game. Both gave their approval, and Selig later ruled that any player who wished to wear #42 on that date could do so. Three teams and several individual players on other teams wore #42 on that date; three other teams whose plans to wear #42 collectively were postponed due to rain on that date did so later in the month. Since 2009, all players and coaches on all teams, as well as all umpires, have worn #42 on April 15 in honor of Robinson. Some feel that Roberto Clemente deserves a similar honor, and that #21 should be retired by all teams. Clemente opened the doors for Hispanics to play Major League Baseball, just as Robinson did for African-Americans. He died in a plane crash in 1972 while helping earthquake victims from Nicaragua, ending his storied career too soon. Number 21 is retired by Clemente's team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and was worn by Sammy Sosa throughout his career as a tribute to his childhood hero. Umpires In 1970, National League umpires first wore identifying numbers on the right sleeve of their shirt or coat. The numbers were assigned in alphabetical order and remained this way through 1978, meaning umpires could, and often did, wear a different number from year-to-year. In 1979, NL umpires chose numbers based upon seniority, and that system remained through 1999, the last season of separate umpiring staffs for the National and American Leagues. American League umpires did not wear identifying numbers until 1980. Unlike the NL, there was no set rules for number assignments. When the AL and NL umpiring staffs were merged in 2000, the senior umpire who wore a given number could keep that number, while the junior umpire had to select a new number.

In 1835, still another turnpike company, the Madison and North Killingworth Turnpike, was chartered to build a road from the end of the Chester and North Killingworth Turnpike to the village of North Madison, using Tooley Road, then Abner Lane, and now abandoned roads across Lake Hammonasset. This series of turnpikes was envisioned by its proponents as part of an all-turnpike route between New Haven and Norwich. The business proved unprofitable, however, and between the years of 1842 and 1847, the various turnpike companies along the Route 148 alignment were dissolved and the roads turned over to the towns. Modern Route 148 was established as part of the 1932 state highway renumbering and originally ran from Route 81 in Killingworth to the Hadlyme railroad station in Lyme. In 1951, the eastern terminus was moved to the Chester ferry landing. In 1962, it was extended westward to Route 79 along its current alignment, and also eastward from the Hadlyme ferry landing to Route 82 (along former SR 618).Connecticut Routes, Route 148 Junction list References External links 148 Category:Transportation in Middlesex County, Connecticut Category:Transportation in New London County, Connecticut ","title":"Connecticut Route 148"},{"id":"13859269","text":"Route 132 is a state highway in western Connecticut, running from Route 47 in Woodbury, through Bethlehem center, to Route 63 in Watertown.

Krebs, Sr. and his son Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. as a medicinal compound for use in treatment of a wide range of diseases. They also termed this chemical \\"Vitamin B15\\", though it is not a true vitamin, has no nutritional value, has no known use in the treatment of any disease and has been called a \\"quack remedy\\". Although a number of compounds labelled \\"pangamic acid\\" have been studied or sold, no chemical compound, including those claimed by the Krebses to be pangamic acid, has been scientifically verified to have the characteristics that defined the original description of the compound. The Krebses derived the term \\"pangamic\\" to describe this compound which they asserted to be ubiquitous and highly concentrated in seeds (pan meaning \\"universal\\" and gamic meaning \\"seed\\"). Chemistry Pangamic acid is the name given to the chemical compound with the empirical formula C10H19O8N and a molecular weight of 281 which appeared to be an ester derived from d-gluconic acid and dimethylglycine. In 1943, the Krebses applied for a patent for a process for extracting this chemical compound which they reported had been previously isolated from apricot seeds, and received the patent in 1949. A 1951 paper by the Krebses reported the first isolation of this compound using this patented process, but did not include enough information to confirm that this compound was actually isolated. In 1955, the Krebses received a patent for another synthesizing process for \\"N-substituted glycine esters of gluconic acid,\\" but the patent contained no supporting data to confirm the process was able to synthesize compounds described by the patent, including pangamic acid. Subsequent attempts at synthesizing this ester by other researchers found Krebs' purported methods of producing pangamic acid were not reproducible, and research into pangamic acid have focused on compounds of various chemical compositions. A review noted that of all the chemicals described in research about pangamic acid, \\"[n]ot a single product labeled \\"pangamate\\" or \\"B15\\" has been established in a scientifically verifiable manner to conform to the empiric formula\\" described by the Krebses. Analysis of a sample of a compound called \\"pangamic acid\\" which was provided by a co-worker of the Krebses in the 1950s showed only lactose upon further evaluation by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thus, \\"pangamic acid\\" is more a label used to describe one of any number of chemical compounds rather than a particular substance. Chemical compounds sold as \\"pangamic acid\\" for medicinal purposes have also had various chemical compositions, and suppliers of \\"pangamic acid\\" have regularly changed the chemical composition of the compounds sold under this label. One anecdote noted that the FDA has seized lots of calcium pangamate sold by General Nutrition Center (GNC), which agreed to stop selling the compound in those bottles after the FDA filed suit to stop sales. Afterwards, it was noted that GNC was still selling something in the same bottles with the same labels, likely a different compound. Due to ambiguity in situations like this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it \\"not an identifiable substance.\\" Clinical claims and research The Krebses' original patent claimed pangamic acid could be used for detoxification as well as treatment of asthma, skin conditions, joint pain, and nerve pain, with none of these claims supported by evidence in the patent application. Early promotion for pangamic acid included use by race horses as well as humans. Although given the name \\"Vitamin B15\\" by the Krebses, there is no evidence that it meets the definition of a vitamin as there is no evidence it is a nutrient needed by the body. Much of the clinical research on pangamic acid took place in the former Soviet Union, though that research often did not describe which of the many compounds called \\"pangamic acid\\" was used in the study. This research was also of limited quality due to being overwhelmingly anecdotal in nature (as opposed to controlled experimentation) and ignoring short and long term safety in human use. Although more recent claims include treatment of a wide variety of conditions including cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia as well as providing improvement in oxygen utilization, there is no significant evidence for any of these claims or that it is safe for human use. One review noted that it meets \\"the criteria that define a quack remedy.\\" Safety Positive results from mutagenicity analysis via the Ames test of compounds commonly found in preparations labelled \\"pangamic acid\\" including diisopropylamine dichloroacetate, diisopropylamine, dichloroacetate, as well as dimethylglycine mixed with sodium nitrite suggests there may be concern for the development of cancer with the use of these substances.

She was vocalist for the now defunct indie rock band Life Without Buildings. Biography Tompkins was born in Leighton Buzzard in 1971. She studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art, and graduated in 1994. Since 1997 she has worked collaboratively with the collective Elizabeth Go (Victoria Morton, Sarah Tripp, Hayley Tompkins and Cathy Wilkes). She has held multiple exhibitions at The Modern Institute. Sue Tompkins uses the spoken and written word delivered in a deceptively simple and direct fashion. The written word comes first: she accumulates copious notes over a period of time then edits and refines them to create disjointed yet succinct texts that combine repeated words with constructed phrases to evoke imagery, emotion and ideas. Tompkins had an interesting way of coming to her unique style of work in art school: > \\"I studied painting. And then by the fourth year at Glasgow School of Art, I > remember really thinking, I really don‚Äôt know what to paint. I really have > no idea. I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. There was a patch where I > remember thinking, god, I just want to go and sit in the library and look at > stuff. I was really into looking at art. I really liked looking at art > books.

I would go into this little room and I had a dictaphone and I > used to just record myself looking.\\" Tompkins also works in a performance medium. Much like her visual and sound- based works, her performances utilise the practice of language, ephemera and live situations. Tompkins also provided the vocals for indie rock band Life Without Buildings, along with other students of the Glasgow School of Art. Spin magazine described Tompkins' vocals as \\"nervously chirped evocative phrases\\" and credited her as the band's central attraction. Following their debut album Any Other City in 2001, the band split up. Her twin sister is the artist Hayley Tompkins. Tompkins lives and works in Glasgow.

The company is based in Pleasanton, California with global operations in Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Taiwan. On November 30, 2018, Shaklee suspended its operations in Mexico after 26 years. History =Founding= Forrest C. Shaklee (1894‚Äì1985), a chiropractor and nutritionist based in his home state of Iowa, and later in Oakland, California, created the first vitamin in the United States labeled \\"Shaklee's Vitalized Minerals\\" in 1915. In 1956, Shaklee founded the Shaklee Corporation with his two sons to manufacture nutritional supplements. Shaklee chose the multi-level marketing business model to market their product. Starting in 1960, Shaklee began marketing organic, biodegradable cleaning products. =Expansion, divestiture, changes of ownership= Shaklee headquarters in Pleasanton Shaklee Corporation was a publicly traded company in the late 1970s and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1980, the firm relocated its headquarters to a state-of-the-art skyscraper in San Francisco's Financial District. The corporation began to diversify in November 1986 when it purchased the Bear Creek Corporation, a direct marketing company best known for its Harry and David Fruit-of-the-Month Club operation, from RJR Nabisco for $123 million. In February 1989 Shaklee sold its 78 percent interest in Shaklee Japan to the Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Company for $350 million, while maintaining its licensing agreement and continuing to collect royalty payments from the Japanese operations. In March 1989, Shaklee Corporation received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from a group led by Irwin L. Jacobs, the Minneapolis financier known also by his nickname \\"Irv the Liquidator\\". Analysts placed the leveraged buyout value of Shaklee at $35 a share. The Jacobs group had been aggressively accumulating Shaklee shares, and disclosed it currently held a 14.98 percent stake in the San Francisco-based company. Shaklee immediately declared a special dividend of $20 a share, seen as a poison pill‚Äîa way to discourage takeover interest in Shaklee, though the company disputed that view. Shaklee's anti-takeover provisions came into play when an investor reached 15 percent. During the next few weeks, Jacobs increased his stake in Shaklee, however, Shaklee Corporation then announced it was being acquired by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical for $28 a share in cash, or about $395 million. Yamanouchi's partnership with Shaklee in Japan helped make the transaction possible, and cast Yamanouchi as a \\"white knight\\" in helping Shaklee fend off the hostile takeover bid by Jacobs. Jacobs announced he would not challenge the Yamanouchi bid and the deal with Yamanouchi was quickly finalized, making Shaklee a privately held company. In the spring of 2000, the company relocated its headquarters from downtown San Francisco to a new complex in suburban Pleasanton. In April 2004, Yamanouchi sold Shaklee Corporation to American multi-millionaire Roger Barnett, managing partner of Activated Holdings LLC and a member of the Wolfson family, for $310 million. Bear Creek and the Harry and David line was sold to Wasserstein Perella & Co. for $260 million. Shaklee promotes itself as a company committed to being green. FTC actions In 1974, in response to Federal Trade Commission order, Shaklee agreed to cease its marketing its product \\"Instant Protein\\" as appropriate for infants, and to cease misrepresentation of the amount of protein in \\"Instant protein.\\" Shaklee was further sanctioned by the FTC in 1976 for \\"requiring, coercing, threatening, or otherwise exerting pressure\\" on its distributors to maintain or advertise suggested retail prices. Controversy about Shaklee Distributors In 2012, New England distributor John \\"Jack\\" William Cranney was charged with leveraging the reputation of his 45-year affiliation with Shaklee to solicit financial investments from other Shaklee distributors, his family and his friends, beginning in 2002. In July 2012, the Massachusetts Securities Division charged Cranney of implementing a financial investment Ponzi scheme to defraud 36 victims in multiple states of about $10.4 million and for using the funds for personal gain. Shaklee immediately suspended distributor payments to Cranney estimated at $45,000 per month. Several victims sued Cranney to recover damages and he sought federal bankruptcy protection for his home, valued at $3 million. Cranney lost the battle for his home and the proceeds from the sale were used to satisfy the claims of some of his alleged victims. In September 2014, the FBI arrested Cranney in El Paso, Texas and charged him with four counts of wire fraud, 16 counts of mail fraud, and three counts of money laundering. Cycling team From 1988 to 2000, Shaklee was the title sponsor of an American-based UCI professional cycling team managed by Frank Scioscia. In its final year of existence (2000), Team Shaklee was the top-ranked UCI tier III team in the world and included United States Olympic Team members Jamie Carney, Jonas Carney, Adam Laurent, and Kent Bostick. There is no information listed as to whether or not the team members actually used Shaklee products. Customers =NASA= Beginning in 1993 and through the end of the NASA shuttle program, Shaklee provided NASA with a customized version of its rehydration beverage, Performance, under the name Astroade for use by Shuttle astronauts.

Operatic career He was born Walter Seligmann in Frankfurt, and studied composition under Arnold Sch√∂nberg in Vienna. He gained experience as conductor in Germany and Switzerland, and was later appointed chief conductor at the Vienna Volksoper (1931‚Äì38). His operatic debut was with Carmen, at the Stadttheater Bern in 1925. Shortly before the 1938 Anschluss of Germany and Austria, Herbert visited Japan to introduce modern western classical music to that country. From there he migrated to the United States, and became an American citizen in 1944. Herbert was director of Opera in English (San Francisco, 1940‚Äì43); and in 1943 was appointed the first general director of the New Orleans Opera Association, which post he held until 1954. He founded the Houston Grand Opera in 1955, where he remained as both general director and conductor until 1972; and was music director of Opera/South (founded by Sister M. Elise Sisson, SBS) in Jackson, Mississippi. He founded the San Diego Opera in 1965, and was its general director and conductor from 1969 until his death. Herbert worked with most of the great singers of his day, and gave many of them their start in the opera world. In April 1948, during Herbert's regime in New Orleans, the young Mario Lanza made one of his very few operatic stage appearances, as Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly; under Herbert's baton and Armando Agnini's stage direction. (It was announced in May 1948 that Lanza had accepted the role of Alfredo Germont, in the New Orleans Opera's La traviata; but Hollywood apparently interfered with those plans.)

History From the 1920s through the 1930s, Turner and boogie-woogie pianist Pete Johnson enjoyed a successful and highly influential collaboration that, following their appearance together at Carnegie Hall on December 23, 1938, helped launch a craze for boogie-woogie in the United States.McGee, David.

After the pair separated, Turner continued to experience cross-genre musical success, establishing himself as one of the founders of rock and roll with such smash hits as \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", but he did not turn his back on his roots. The Boss of the Blues marks one of the last reunions Turner would have with Johnson, when, supported by a number of swing's best performers,, he re-created a number of the classic tracks that had helped lay the groundwork for rhythm and blues.

Legacy De Soysa, the far sighted native entrepreneur and philanthropist played the role of a paternal figure in 19th century Ceylon. He was the first Ceylonese since the days of the Sinhalese kings to build and equip a complete hospital. He introduced a system of free education long before the state took on that responsibility. The example he set in philanthropy is unique in our annals; he catered from the womb to the tomb. In contrast to the latter day culture where institutions built by public funds, foreign gifts or collected through charities are named after individuals, particularly politicians, most institutions pioneered by De Soysa's personal wealth and foresight were in fact not named after himself. He was a public man of the first degree. The first steps towards a formation of a political process which later opened up the possibility of negotiating legislative reforms, self governance and independence were initiated with the stand taken by Mr. De Soysa and others. All the major political parties in Sri Lanka, with the exception of the Marxist and communalist parties can trace their origins even partly to the Ceylon Agricultural Association. De Soysa was far ahead of his times in understanding the importance of the economic, social and moral progress in the process of nation building.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich. Its benefice is combined with those of St Michael's, Baddiley and St Mary's and St Michael's, Burleydam. History This was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church, Acton. The present church dates from the early 16th century with alterations and additions in the 18th and 19th centuries; the nave and porch were restored in 1794, the chancel was rebuilt in 1806 and restored in 1865. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built of red sandstone ashlar with a tile roof. Its plan consists of a west tower, a five- bay clerestoried nave with narrow aisles, a chancel, and a south porch. The tower is embattled with pinnacles at the corners. The west door has been converted into a window and above this is another, three-light, window. The upper bell openings are of two lights, and protruding from the southeast angle is an octagonal stair turret climbing to the roof of the tower. =Interior= The tie-beam roof of the nave, which includes bosses, dates from the late 16th century. The nave contains box pews, many of them having the arms of local families on their doors. The pew nearest the door was for the dog whipper who, in addition to controlling dogs in the church, had the duty of waking those who fell asleep during the sermon. The pulpit is early Georgian, and the west gallery dates from the late 18th century. The parish chest is in the tower, it is over long, and is secured by 14 iron straps. The elaborate brass chandelier was presented to the church in 1839. The font is made from sandstone. The parish registers begin in 1593 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1771. Monuments Monuments in the church commemorate the Cotton family of Combermere Abbey as well as the Starkey family of Wrenbury Hall.

His earliest documented work was painted in 1495 for the cloister of the Cathedral of Toledo. Borgo√±a‚Äôs compositions are well balanced with finely drawn figures in elegant, tranquil poses. They are set either against open spaces leading on to craggy landscapes or against gold embroidered drapery. There were a number of foreign painters active in Spain in this period, including Juan de Flandes. He brought the Quattrocento form of paintings into Castile. He is not to be confused with another painter Joan de Burgunya or Borgunya who was active in Catalonia between 1510 and 1525.

Origins This line was spoken in a television commercial for a medical alarm and protection company called LifeCall. The motivation behind the systems is that subscribers, mostly senior citizens as well as disabled people, would receive a pendant which, when activated, would allow the user to speak into an audio receiving device and talk directly with a dispatch service, without the need to reach a telephone. The service was designed to appeal particularly to seniors who lived alone and who might experience a medical emergency, such as a fall, which would leave them alert but immobile and unable to reach the telephone. In 1989, LifeCall began running commercials that contained a scene wherein an elderly woman, identified by a dispatcher as \\"Mrs. Fletcher\\", uses the medical alert pendant after having fallen in the bathroom. After falling, Mrs. Fletcher speaks the phrase \\"I've fallen, and I can't get up!\\", after which the dispatcher informs her that he is sending help. By 1990, the Phoenix New Times reported that \\"From coast to coast, from playground to barroom, an enfeebled whine rings out across the land. All together now: 'I've fallen . . . and I can't get up!'\\" The catchphrase appeared on t-shirts, novelty records, and in standup comedy. In 1992, a sample of the catchphrase was featured in parody artist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's song \\"I Can't Watch This\\" (a parody of M.C. Hammer's \\"U Can't Touch This\\"). According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, after first applying in October 1990, LifeCall registered the phrase \\"I've fallen, and I can't get up\\" as a trademark in September 1992 until its status was cancelled in 1999. In October 2002, the similar phrase \\"Help! I've fallen, and I can't get up!\\" became a registered trademark of Life Alert Emergency Response, Inc. The registration was cancelled in May 2013. A new registration was granted in May 2014. Life Alert had filed for the phrase \\"Help, I've fallen & can't get up!\\" in March 2001, but the application was abandoned in November 2001. In June 2007, the phrase \\"I've fallen, and I can't get up!\\" also became a registered trademark of Life Alert. Both phrases are currently used on their website as well as in their commercials. Edith Fore (n√©e Edith Americus DeVirgilis; 1916‚Äì1997) portrayed Mrs. Fletcher. Although a stuntperson performed the fall itself, Fore said that she created the \\"I've fallen\\" line while discussing the accident with LifeCall.

Alleged July 2016 assassination  According to Turkey's official state news agency Anadolu Agency, and the Daily Sabah citing Anadolu Agency, he was killed in Syria on 8 July 2016. A person under the name of Halid el Hasekavi, spokesman of an anti- regime armed group named Tel Hamis Brigades, told an AA correspondent that H√ºseyin was allegedly targeted near northern Syrian city of Qamishli. He claimed that H√ºseyin's car was blown up at 8:30 p.m. on 8 July, being killed along with eight people including his guards. On 12 July, the Yeni Safak quoted the Turkish MIT intelligence service as the source of this story. Sources close to PKK denied these claims. The story was debunked when Erdal gave a radio interview on 13 July and later thoroughly deconstructed as fake by international media. He appeared on a video in April 2017 and addressed to Turkish citizens about the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum.

It is danced to music in or time signature, with about 140 beats per minute. Men and women do similar steps. The initial dance position is with the man to the left of the woman both facing in the direction of the line of dance, with their inner arms on each other's waists. The dancers go forward in a run similar to that of the polka: \\"left-right-left-hop (on the left foot)\\", \\"right-left-right-hop\\".

Davies (born Birkenhead, 14 July 1927, died Caldy, Wirral, 19 March 2020)Obituary: Peter Davies, 1927-2020 University of Liverpool; In memoriam: Emeritus Professor Peter Davies was a British economic historian with interests in the port of Liverpool, sea-based trade with West Africa, the Canary Islands and Japan, the international fruit trade and the military history of the River Kwai campaign in World War II. He was an Emeritus Professor in the School of History at the University of Liverpool, England. Davies was the author of several books including, \\"The Trade Makers, Elder Dempster in West Africa\\" (Allen and Unwin, 1973), \\"Trading in West Africa\\" (Croom Helm, 1976), \\"Sir Alfred Jones: Shipping Entrepreneur par Excellence\\" (Europa, 1978), \\"Fyffes and the Banana, Musa Sapientum\\" (Athlone Press, 1990), \\"Japanese Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries: A History of Their Modern Growth\\" (with T. Chida, Athlone Press, 1990), \\"The Man Behind the Bridge: Colonel Toosey and the River Kwai\\" (Athlone Press, 1991), and \\"From Orchard to Market\\" (with D.Hope-Mason, Lockwood Press, 2005). During a long career at the University of Liverpool which began in 1958 when he entered as an undergraduate in the Department of Economic History (later known as ‚ÄòEconomic and Social History‚Äô), Davies became Acting Head of Department in 1979 and Head of Department from 1980-89, after which he was awarded a personal Chair. Davies continued the tradition of commitment to Maritime History which had been initiated by Francis Hyde and maintained by John Harris (subsequently Professor of Economic History at the University of Birmingham) and Sheila Marriner. Taken together, Hyde, Harris, Marriner and Davies have become known as the \\"Liverpool School of Maritime Historians\\".Davies PN, \\"The Liverpool School of Maritime History\\". International Journal of Maritime History (2005);XVII, 2 pp249‚Äì260.Milne G, \\"Trade and Traders in Mid-Victorian Liverpool: Mercantile Business and the Making of a World Port\\" (Liverpool University Press, 2000) pp 5‚Äì6. His interests in the maritime affairs of Japan resulted in Visiting Professor appointments at Musashi University, Tokyo in 1979 and at Hiroshima Shudo University in 1990-91. \\"The Business, Life and Letters of Frederick Cornes : Aspects of the Evolution of Commerce in Modern Japan, 1861-1912\\" (Global Oriental: ) was published in September 2008. In this book Davies examined the surprisingly well-preserved papers of Frederick Cornes, a merchant from Cheshire, England who spent much of his life trading in Japan's port city of Yokohama during and after the Meiji Restoration, including the entire correspondence of \\"Cornes and Company\\" extending over a forty-year period in the early years of Anglo-Japanese trade. Davies's last book, \\"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\\" (Renaissance Books: ), was published in August 2013. Davies acted as editor to Ewart Escritt's translation of the personal records of Japanese Railway Engineer Yoshihiko Futamatsu. Davies had come to know Futamatsu through his research for the 1991 biography of Philip Toosey \\"The Man Behind the Bridge\\" and secured his agreement that his memoirs could be published in English after his death.Davies PN (ed), Futamatsu Y \\"Across the Three Pagodas Pass: The Story of the Thai-Burma Railway\\" (Renaissance Books: ). The book is therefore a rare account from the Japanese viewpoint of the construction of the Thai-Burma Railway (and the River Kwai Bridge) during World War II.

The Archer family tree The Archer family Jill Archer n√©e Patterson (born 3 October 1930) (Patricia Greene) is the widow of Phil Archer and matriarch of the family. She was his second wife, and with him had four children: twins Shula and Kenton, and David and Elizabeth. She is busily involved in village life and supports her children by taking on child-minding duties. Jill is an active member of the Women's Institute, opened up a holiday cottage business, and is teaching her grandson, Josh, how to keep bees. Jill has a less traditional outlook on life than her late husband, who had been a Justice of the Peace, reflected in her opposition to both fox hunting and private education. Following a burglary at Glebe Cottage she was asked by David and Ruth to return to Brookfield which subsequently became permanent. In 2019, she surprised her family by announcing that she had met a new man - Leonard Berry, a widower who she met while visiting the Laurels. Since then, Jill and Leonard have enjoyed a cosy companionship, complicated slightly when Leonard thought Jill wanted them to get married - when she made it clear that she had no desire to have another husband, they happily resumed their relationship. Christine Barford n√©e Archer, formerly Johnson (born 21 December 1931) (Lesley Saweard, formerly played by Pamela Mant and briefly Joyce Gibbs), is the younger sister of Phil. A skilled horsewoman, she ran the local riding stables for many years. In the early 1950s she was a close friend of Grace Fairbrother who later married her brother Phil. Christine married Paul Johnson; it was discovered she was infertile, and they adopted a son, Peter. In the mid-1970s Paul deserted the family and he was later killed in a helicopter crash in Germany. In 1979 Christine married George Barford, a gamekeeper, which was seen as a class transgression, even though her uncle, Tom Forrest was also a gamekeeper, and colleague of her future husband. Her marriage to George lasted over 25 years and was happy, but latterly they experienced difficult times as their house burned down due to an arson attack by Clive Horrobin. George died peacefully whilst they were waiting for the house to be re-built. Christine lived with Peggy Woolley for some years but in 2018 suffered a fall and went into The Laurels initially for respite but is intending to take up a place in an assisted living flat. She lost her capital in a fraud perpetuated by associates of Matt Crawford. Peggy Woolley, n√©e Perkins, formerly Archer (born Margaret Perkins, 13 November 1924) (June Spencer, briefly played by Thelma Rogers) is the widow of Phil's elder brother, Jack Archer, and of Jack Woolley. When married to Jack Archer, they managed (and later owned) the Bull. After many years of close friendship, Peggy married Jack Woolley. Peggy has two daughters, Jennifer and Lillian, and a son, Tony, by her first husband. She is indulgent of her grandchildren and has provided several of them with significant financial support. Although she was something of a left wing firebrand in her youth she is now very conservative living in The Lodge which was the gatehouse for Grey Gables. Jennifer Aldridge, (n√©e Archer, formerly Travers-Macy) (born Jennifer Elizabeth Archer, 1945) (Angela Piper) is the older daughter of Peggy Archer (and step-daughter of Jack Woolley). She is married to Brian Aldridge. For more details see below under Aldridge family. Lilian Bellamy, n√©e Archer (born 8 July 1947) (Sunny Ormonde, formerly played by Elizabeth Marlowe) is the twice-widowed, gin-soaked, chain-smoking second daughter of Peggy Archer (and step-daughter of Jack Woolley). After acquiring her second husband Ralph Bellamy in 1971, she left Ambridge to live with him in tax exile in the Channel Islands; she has by him a grown-up son James (rarely encountered except when he needs money). Bellamy senior died in 1980, but Lilian unaccountably returned to Ambridge in 2003 and took up with Matt Crawford (then a married man); her exploits cause much gnashing of teeth from her respectable sister Jennifer Aldridge. Lilian was elected to the parish council in January 2006. Lilian took dancing lessons from Mike Tucker after she discovered that Crawford's ex-wife was a much better dancer than she. In 2008 she and Crawford were briefly separated, and Lilian was an unwelcome guest at The Bull, but with the connivance of Sid and Jolene they were reunited. Crawford has since served a prison term for fraud. Their relationship was further tested when his long-lost brother Paul Morgan sought out, befriended, and ultimately fell in love with Lilian. After Matt's release the couple grew closer and ran property investment start-up Amside Holdings together ‚Äì until Matt deserted her to live with another woman in Costa Rica. Since then she has formed a relationship with Justin Elliott, a wealthy businessman. Tony Archer (born Anthony William Daniel Archer, 16 February 1951) (David Troughton, formerly played by Colin Skipp) is the youngest child and only son of Peggy Archer (and step-son of Jack Woolley). In his younger days he romanced a string of girlfriends and led a laddish life before settling down to marry Pat, with whom he now runs a fully organic establishment at Bridge Farm. Despite owning an MG sports car, bought with a windfall from his mother, he is generally considered to be a rather dull man. His brother-in-law Brian Aldridge enjoys winding him up over farming matters, and dinner parties involving the two couples usually end in tears. Pat and Tony had three children, John, Helen and Tom. John was killed in a tractor accident. Helen had a baby boy, Henry Ian Archer, through AI, a decision of which Tony initially disapproved. Tom runs a sausage business and makes pork ready meals under the Tom Archer brand. Tony suffered a heart attack in late February 2012, and a serious farmyard accident in autumn 2014. Having recovered from both, he now takes more of a back seat in the family business. Pat Archer n√©e Lewis (born Patricia Lewis, 10 January 1952) (Patricia Gallimore) Tony's wife since 1974 is of Welsh descent. Much taken with studying feminism in the mid-1980s she came close to having an affair with her lecturer, Roger, just before Bridge Farm entered the process of becoming organic. Affected by severe depression at the time of John's death, she discovered at the end of 2011 that he had fathered a child. Filled with remorse, Pat had strongly disapproved of Sharon, John's girlfriend, and this discovery turned into an obsession which caused problems for her family. She also had problems with her daughter Helen's new boyfriend Rob in 2014, especially given the affair and the break- down of a marriage within which they were brought together. Although she came to accept him after Helen made a drastic move and left her family home and moved in with Rob in February, she had questioned whether Rob had played a part in Helen quitting her long- running job at the Ambridge Organics store. Her deceased son John's teenage son Johnny took up residence at Bridge Farm when he came to the village but when Helen and her children returned both Tom and Johnny moved to Number 1, The Green owned by Will Grundy. (See also Former principal characters.) Shula Hebden-Lloyd, n√©e Archer, previously Hebden (born Shula Mary Archer, 8 August 1958) (Judy Bennett) is the elder daughter of Phil and Jill and twin sister of Kenton. Her first husband, Mark Hebden, a solicitor, was killed in a road accident in 1994 that also involved her best friend Caroline Bone (later Sterling). Shula and Mark's son Daniel was born after the death of his father as a result of IVF treatment after a long struggle with infertility. Some years after Mark's death, Shula had an affair with the village doctor (who was himself living with Shula's hitherto good friend Usha Gupta), thus two-timing her boyfriend Alistair (the local vet) whom she subsequently married. This was in the context of Shula's devout Christianity and membership of the local Parish Council. She owns and runs the riding stables which formerly belonged to Christine Barford, her aunt. She used once to have great fun with her best friend, Caroline, but later Caroline became engrossed in her relationship with her husband Oliver Sterling and their business activities. After her marriage to Alistair, Shula lost her lightheartedness and became rather dour, self-centred and even, at times, sanctimonious, as evidenced by her attitude to the marriage to Usha Gupta, a Hindu, of the vicar, to whom Shula had been 'right-hand woman' for the parish. Coping with the childhood arthritis of her son, Daniel, did not help, nor did her husband's gambling addiction, which nearly destroyed their marriage before he finally admitted to owing huge sums to Matt Crawford and others. The couple resolved to stay together; they remortgaged the business to pay off the debts and Alistair attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Daniel was expected to go to university to read Law in his father's footsteps, but upset his mother by joining the Royal Tank Regiment, though later she accepted his choice of career. In 2018, Shula stunned Alistair when she told him their marriage was over. Now divorced, they are still good friends and probably closer than they had been in the last few years of their marriage. In 2019, Shula surprised her family when she announced her intention to take the initial steps to becoming a Church of England vicar. Alistair Lloyd (born 1962) (Michael Lumsden), Shula's ex-husband, is a vet. His father Professor Jim Lloyd (John Rowe) stayed with them at Christmas and New Year 2007-8 while his broken leg healed. A committed atheist he riled Shula and antagonised his son, but indulged Daniel and contrived to get along with everyone else, except for Phil who saw through him. Alistair mentored Ryan at Gamblers Anonymous.Gillian Reynolds \\"The Archers\\", Daily Telegraph, 20 September 2008 Jim later relocated, bought his own property in Ambridge and went into a business partnership with Kenton which was dissolved when Kenton moved to the Bull. Currently Alistair is living Jim's house and Jazzer McCreary is also co-resident. In 2019 Alistair's sister Fiona Lloyd (Adjoa Andoh) visited Ambridge to celebrate her father Jim's birthday. Kenton Archer (born Kenton Edward Archer, 8 August 1958) (Richard Attlee, formerly played by Graeme Kirk) is portrayed as the wastrel of the Archer family. Having turned his back on the family farm to join the Merchant Navy, Kenton tried his hand at a number of ventures, including selling antiques and running a wine bar. He disappeared to Australia and New Zealand for several years and was married (originally to gain a visa, though they subsequently fell in love), had a daughter (Meriel), and divorced before returning home. Kenton's former partner, Kathy Perks, is the ex-wife of Sid Perks, the late landlord of The Bull. His current wife is Sid's widow, Jolene whom he married in autumn 2013 at Lower Loxley. Together they run the Bull. Jolene Archer, formerly Perks (Buffy Davis), widow of Sid Perks, whose third wife she was, and landlady of the Bull. When younger she was a stalwart of the Borsetshire Country and Western scene (under the name The Lily of Layton Cross), and object of Eddie Grundy's affections, much to Clarrie's distress. Following Sid's untimely death she formed a relationship with Kenton Archer, and they were married in 2013. David Archer (born David Thomas Archer, 18 September 1959) (Timothy Bentinck, formerly played by Nigel Carrivick) is the second son of Phil and Jill and, as the only child of the four to show any interest in, or aptitude for, farming, has assumed responsibility for Brookfield Farm. Over recent years he has become increasingly caring, for example driving up to Northumberland to bring his widowed mother-in-law to stay, and renting a piece of land to Joe Grundy to allow him to keep the barn he had erected without planning permission. Brookfield has suffered in recent years from bovine TB, but David is enthusiastic about his herd of Herefords. His cowman's heavy-handed advice (which he and Ruth reluctantly accepted) that they should dispense with the services of Shula's husband as vet for their dairy herd in favour of a specialist caused a serious family rift, and was followed by his near-affair with Sophie Barlow. Recently, he bought an old tractor, dubbed Rufus, which he has restored. Ruth Archer, n√©e Pritchard (born 16 June 1968) (Felicity Finch) is the wife of David Archer. Unusually the character comes from a real rather than fictional place, Prudhoe in Northumberland. She came to Ambridge as a Harper Adams student looking for agricultural work experience in 1987, and promptly met David, who was keen to settle down: the couple married within two years. They have three children: Philippa (Pip), Josh and Ben. Ruth survived breast cancer which struck in 2000, undergoing a mastectomy operation. Ruth's utterance \\"Oh noooooo\\", spoken in her Northumberland accent, was frequently parodied on the BBC Radio Four comedy programme Dead Ringers. In an unpopular and heavily criticised plotline Ruth teetered on the brink of an affair with farm employee Sam Batton in the autumn of 2006. Many listeners considered Ruth's behaviour during this storyline to be entirely out of character, and therefore unbelievable. Others thought her immature self-centred vacillation was entirely in character, and it was the largely off-air rehabilitation of the marriage and the family's 'blind eye' that was unbelievable. She has since undergone breast reconstruction surgery to restore listeners' empathy with her (not entirely successfully), and coped rather better than David with the sudden transformation of priggish daughter Pip into a very stroppy seventeen-year-old with a much older boyfriend, Jude, who eventually dropped her. More recently, Ruth has suffered a miscarriage and championed a potential move from Brookfield to Prudhoe should \\"Route B\\" be constructed, breaking the farm in two. Although David went along with this at first, he had doubts and confessed he could never leave Ambridge. Elizabeth Pargetter, n√©e Archer (born Elizabeth Ann Archer, 21 April 1967) (Alison Dowling). The youngest child of Phil and Jill Archer, Elizabeth is the widowed lady of Lower Loxley. Following her marriage to Nigel Pargetter, she took to her role like a duck to water and her quick mind and sound business sense ensure that the Hall runs like a well- oiled machine. Her practical side was the perfect grounding for her eccentric and slightly scatty husband, who died in a fall on 2 January 2011. As the family rallied round, devastated Elizabeth drew her precious twins close to her. After David admitted to her that it had been he who had convinced her husband to go on the roof in the first-place, Elizabeth exploded in a violent rage, and swore she would never forgive him. After 18 months David was being targeted by the Horrobins and Elizabeth realised the feud had gone on for too long and family relations returned to normal. Helen Titchener, n√©e Archer (born 16 April 1979) (Louiza Patikas, formerly played by Frances Graham and Bonnie Engstrom), Tony and Pat Archer's daughter, makes a cheese called \\"Borsetshire Blue\\" in the farm dairy and runs the organic farm shop, Ambridge Organics, in Borchester. After the suicide of her gamekeeper partner Greg Turner in 2004, she suffered from anorexia nervosa, but recovered after a time at a specialist clinic. In 2006 she dated a journalist who quickly rejected her; this subsequently threatened a return to her earlier problems. On New Year's Day 2007, whilst driving drunk, she knocked down Mike Tucker but Tom, a passenger in the car, took the blame. The shock of this event made her re- evaluate her life and she has since helped develop a new type of cheese with Oliver Sterling. After another failed relationship she decided that she wanted a child more than she wanted a partner, and became pregnant by artificial insemination ‚Äì a decision which caused friction within the family, particularly alienating Tony. Father and daughter were reconciled, however, after the birth of her son Henry Ian Archer, who was delivered by emergency caesarean section the day after New Years Day 2011, Helen having been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. In 2013 she was attracted to the recently arrived dairy unit manager, Rob Titchener. Intimacy ensued, although Rob was still married to Jess, who remained in Hampshire caring for her sick father. Helen and Henry moved in with Rob in early 2014, and Helen and Rob married in summer 2015. During 2015, the increasing indications Rob was coercively controlling and emotionally abusing Helen, became a major plot line. In April 2016, after meeting secretly with Jess, Helen stabbed Rob after he refused to let her and Henry leave (placing a knife in her hands, goading her to end her own life, then lashing out at Henry when the child interrupted the confrontation). Subsequently, she was arrested and charged with attempted murder. In an hour-long special broadcast on Sunday 11 September 2016, she was ultimately acquitted after the jury decided that she had acted in self- defence. Tom Archer (born Thomas Archer, 25 February 1981) (William Troughton; previously Tom Graham) is the younger son of Tony and Pat. He took over his elder brother's pig herd after John was killed in a tractor accident, going on to produce organic sausages. Tom and his then girlfriend Kirsty faced criminal charges in 1999 for the destruction of a field of genetically modified crops on Brian Aldridge's land, but neither was convicted. Tom is highly ambitious for his sausage-making business, but his contract with a supermarket chain nearly bankrupted him, despite his disastrous affair with their buyer, Tamsin. Tom was engaged to Brenda Tucker between May 2009 and April 2013. Tom was decided to throw in his lot with Brian Aldridge, husband of his aunt Jennifer, becoming a junior partner in the business. In the process, the sausage business lost its organic status, which created further tension between the families. In February 2006 he started dating Brenda Tucker, having provided support to her when her mother died suddenly two months earlier. Later the same year, Tom expanded his business and set up a new independent business, Gourmet Grills, essentially a burger van albeit specialising in high-quality meat products. When Helen ran over Mike Tucker, Tom took the blame and unaware that it had been Helen driving, Mike turned against him, opposing his relationship with Brenda. Mike subsequently discovered the truth, Helen paid for the driving course that Tom was sentenced to attend, and Tom and Brenda moved into one of the holiday cottages at Home Farm. After Will Grundy bought No. 1 The Green, Tom and Brenda rented the house from Will. After a brief split from Brenda, they got back together and got engaged on 29 May 2009. In April 2013 Brenda decided to end the engagement and the couple separated. Tom later got back together with Kirsty, with whom he got engaged at Christmas 2013, the ring being in the last Christmas cracker, but after a crisis of confidence, Tom broke up with Kirsty in the vestry moments before their planned wedding. Subsequently, Tom sold his business and moved to Canada. He returned to Ambridge as soon as he heard about his father's accident. After his sister Helen's trial and acquittal, Tom and Kirsty got back together for one evening and she later discovered that she was pregnant. While preparing for the birth of the child Tom applied for, and gained a Nuffield Scholarship, which he hoped would enable him to set up an organic baby food business. Sadly, Kirsty miscarried and Tom lost all enthusiasm for baby food, returning from his travels instead with a passion for fermented food, something not widely shared in the family or the village. While on the Nuffield Scheme, Tom fell for a previous Nuffield Scholar and then mentor, Natasha. After a long period of pining, Tom discovered that she was similarly attracted and they married after a whirlwind romance. They currently live in the flat above the village shop. Pip Archer (born Philippa Rose Archer, 17 February 1993) (Daisy Badger; previously Helen Monks) was christened Philippa in homage to David's father and Rose after Ruth's aunt: the eldest Brookfield child is known in the family as Pip, and at college as Phiz. She inherited some of grandfather Phil's interest in music, learning to play the piano and singing solos at carol concerts. Pip has a clear interest in farming, and also caring for the environment. Pip split from her first boyfriend called Jonathan, a boy she met at her YFC (Young Farmers Club) and began an affair with a much older man, a mature student at Borchester College called Jude Simpson. Her parents did not approve. Jude eventually left the country without her after leading Pip to believe that they were going on a round the world backpacking trip together. After a work placement in Yorkshire she became more focused on her future and the future of the farm. She finished her degree in the summer of 2015 and accepted a post with an international agri-business with which she could gain experience of farming around the world. But during the initial orientation, she changed her mind and decided to return home to Ambridge and work with her parents at Brookfield. She became involved with Toby Fairbrother a son of Robin Fairbrother (who briefly romanced Elizabeth many years ago). As a result, Pip became pregnant leading to the birth of Rosie Ruth Grace Archer, her third forename recognising the Fairbrother heritage. Josh Archer, played by Angus Imrie, made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 September 1997. He was originally played by Cian Cheesbrough. Josh is Ruth and David Archer's eldest son, and Pip and Ben's brother. Growing up, Josh helps his parents out around the farm. He also takes part in a spate of graffiti around the village for which he is grounded. Josh later partners Neil Carter in a free-range egg business, before he launches his own business buying, renovating, and selling farm vehicles. Ben Archer played by Ben Norris. Ben is David and Ruth Archer's youngest son, and Pip and Josh's brother, having been born on 15 March 2002. He has had a remarkably quiet childhood as Brookfield has been less important in the village with Bridge Farm elbowing other farms out of the spotlight. He has spent much time playing computer games with R√∫airi Donovan (Brian's illegitimate son) and since gaining a voice they have taken a huge interest in off-road driving and Ben helped Jill in the kitchen at Christmas. Ben debuted on 28 October 2018. As a reward for his misdemeanours and to get him interested in farming Ben is now training the new sheepdog \\"Bess\\". The Grundy family The Grundys were minor characters until the early 1980s, when they were developed to be a working-class foil to the Archer family. Joe Grundy (born 18 September 1921) (Edward Kelsey, formerly played by Reg Johnston and Haydn Jones) is the oldest of this well-established local family and often provides comic relief. Joe maintained for many years that the Archer dynasty had robbed them of their estate. After years attempting to keep the family farm afloat, they were made bankrupt in 2000 - an opportunity for the mainly urban audience to witness the personal and family tragedy of farm sales ‚Äì and were forced to move to a sink estate in Borchester. Joe took this especially hard and in one of the most harrowing episodes ever broadcast, bludgeoned his beloved ferrets to death with a hammer. The family moved back to Ambridge shortly thereafter. Lately he has begun to assist Oliver Sterling in the management of a new dairy herd at Grange Farm and has celebrated his ninetieth birthday. Following the death of Bob Pullen in 2012, Joe became Ambridge's oldest living resident. He died in his sleep at the age of 98 in October 2019. Alf Grundy (born 13 November 1944), Joe's oldest son, and a rogue. Appears intermittently in the series and is usually up to no good. Eddie Grundy (born 15 March 1951) (Trevor Harrison) is Joe's son and Clarrie's husband. During their marriage he was unrequitedly enamoured of Jolene Rogers (later Perks, now Archer), his partner in a country and western double act. Eddie's hopes of a career in music appear to have been permanently dashed. He has a history of involving himself in numerous dubious money-making schemes and at one point stood trial for unwittingly selling condemned meat. He mainly makes his living by raising turkeys for Christmas, laying patios and selling novelty garden gnomes. He makes cider and kept a pig called Barbarella. Joe has participated in some of Eddie's money-making schemes; at other times he scolds his son: legality never dictates his response. Clarrie Grundy n√©e Larkin (born 12 May 1954) (Heather Bell, part created by Bell\\"Heather Bell returns to Radio 4's The Archers to reprise role of Clarrie Grundy\\", BBC Media Centre, 9 January 2013 and also formerly played by Fiona Mathieson and Rosalind Adams) is Eddie Grundy's long-suffering wife, having married him in 1982. She became involved with him after her late father Jethro employed him to remove the range in their home. Clarrie spends much of her time sorting out problems created by her husband, sons and father-in-law. She works at the dairy at Bridge Farm, where Pat Archer is a good friend, and formerly worked behind the bar at the Bull. In 2011 she was responsible for an outbreak of E-Coli at Bridge Farm. William Grundy (born 9 February 1983) (Philip Molloy) is the elder son of Eddie and Clarrie. He is gamekeeper for Borchester Land; his boss is Brian Aldridge. In August 2004, he married Emma Carter and they had a son, George, but she harboured a dark secret. Whilst Will was engaged to Emma, she enjoyed two one-night stands with his brother Ed, including one on her hen night, leading her to believe that Ed was George's father. Eventually she left Will for Ed, taking George with her, although George was later shown by DNA paternity testing to be Will's child. Will's existing rivalry with Ed became even more intense: to Clarrie's despair, the brothers engaged in physical tussles and bitter arguments over Emma and George. In 2008 he was left ¬£120,000 by a relative, and bought the Carters' former home from Matt Crawford, a property his friend Roy Tucker had been interested in. Will and Ed's rivalry culminated in a fight in which Will nearly killed Ed, and Will moved temporarily to another gamekeeping job in Gloucestershire. Christmas 2008 saw Will reunite with ex-girlfriend Nic, whom he originally split from when he saw her hit George. After returning to Ambridge in February 2009, Will pushed for Nic and her 2 children (Jake (then 4) and Mia (then 2)), to move back in with him: they did, and in 2010 Nic started occasional bar work at The Bull, a career move which traditionally leads to expanded roles. 1 January 2012 saw Will & Nic get married at the local Grey Gables Hotel followed by a honeymoon in Cap Verde which on their return led to the renaming of their cottage to Greenwood. Will's dog is called Meg. Will and Nic have a daughter Poppy. Nic died unexpectedly of sepsis in February 2018. Despite being severely affected by her death, Will's pride and stubbornness prevented him from seeking counselling for his grief, and his worsened temper and aggression led to him driving away both Jake and Mia, leaving him with only his biological daughter, Poppy. Ed Grundy (born 28 September 1984) (Barry Farrimond) is the younger son of Eddie and Clarrie. Ed took up his father's interest in music and aspired to be in a band. A farm labourer, Ed secured a job in France and planned to move there secretly with Emma and George, but they were thwarted in November 2005 by Will. In May 2006, Ed vanished after Emma left the caravan and moved into her parents' home, saying it was for the sake of her baby's health. He remained missing, despite a police investigation into his disappearance, until July 2006 when he was admitted to hospital after being beaten up while sleeping rough in Borchester. Whilst living as a vagrant, he had become addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine. Ed had a history of drug use and petty crime including joyriding. On returning to the village, Ed at first sought refuge with mentor and past employer, Oliver Sterling, who did his best to help him face his demons and abandon his vices. With the additional help of family support and counselling Ed has made major steps towards recovery, demonstrated by his increased dedication to Oliver Sterling's dairy farm. In April 2011 their daughter, Keira Susan, was born. In late 2012, financial troubles reflecting earlier reductions in milk prices forced the couple to move back in with Emma's parents. Emma Grundy, n√©e Carter (Emerald O'Hanrahan, formerly played by Felicity Jones) is the daughter of Susan and Neil Carter, who were horrified when their daughter announced she was marrying into the Grundy family. When Will discovered her infidelity with his brother, she moved with Ed and baby George to a caravan outside her parents' home. A parental testing showed that despite Emma's certainty to the contrary, George was Will's son. She returned to live with her parents in 2006, but moved out to live at a cottage on Brookfield Farm with Ed and Georgie as a family together. New daughter Keira was born in 2011 and following financial problems, they returned to live with Emma's parents in 2012. In late 2019, Emma and Ed separated although they still share parenting duties. The Aldridge family Brian Aldridge (born Brian Jeremy Aldridge, 20 November 1943) (Charles Collingwood), considered by some to be the villain of the serial, is sometimes seen as one of the most interesting and subtle characters. Married to Jack and Peggy Archer's daughter Jennifer, he is primarily a farmer, but has interests in a number of businesses, including Borchester Land. and a former partnership in Tom Archer's sausage business. Brian has had several extramarital affairs during his marriage to Jennifer, including at least one with (the then) Caroline Bone (1985) and more recently with the Irish-born translator Siobh√°n Hathaway (Caroline Lennon), which produced his only son, R√∫airi. He has an uncomfortable relationship with his stepson, Adam, which has been the source of some friction with his wife. Brian's somewhat cavalier attitude to regulations came back to haunt him, when it transpired that in the 1970s he had taken money to allow the dumping of toxic chemicals on Home Farm land, which by the late 2010s had started to leak into the Am. Brian was prosecuted by The Environment Agency and forced to retire from active management of the farm. To pay his fines he and Jenny were forced to sell the farmhouse and move into rented accommodation. Jennifer Aldridge, n√©e Archer (born 7 January 1945) (Angela Piper) is the elder daughter of Peggy Woolley by her first husband, Jack Archer. In early years her character was the hippie of the Archer family, her first child, Adam, being ‚Äî sensationally at the time ‚Äî the illegitimate result of a fling with a cowman, Paddy Redmond. She married a travelling businessman, Roger Travers-Macy, in the late 1960s and had a daughter, Debbie. She then divorced him and married Brian Aldridge. With Brian she had two daughters, Kate and Alice. Jennifer has endured Brian's series of affairs over the years, partly by having one affair with her ex-husband, though Brian has long suspected John Tregorran as having rivalled him for Jennifer's affections at one time. Jennifer's current main source of worry is the behaviour of her gin-soaked, chain-smoking sister Lilian, who has moved back into the village. This concern has been shared with her brother Tony, whom Jennifer is usually keen to put down. Adam Macy (born 22 June 1967) (Andrew Wincott) is the first child of Jennifer Aldridge, his father being former Brookfield farmhand Paddy Redmond (only confirmed by Jennifer herself in 2015.) Adam was adopted by Roger Travers-Macy, Jennifer's first husband. Adam lived abroad for many years, mainly in Kenya, helping breed goats, but came back to the family farm when a major relationship broke up. After a year or so, he fell in love with Ian Craig, the chef at Grey Gables. Ian and Adam's liaison has elicited little moral outrage or criticism in the village, with the exception of Sid Perks, the late landlord of the pub, and Adam's grandmother Peggy Woolley, who was distinctly uncomfortable with the relationship. Adam and Ian considered embarking on parenthood; Ian had plans to artificially inseminate his old friend, Madds, and share responsibility for the child they hoped to produce, but Madds then fell in love with another man and changed her mind. The producers of The Archers maintain this was a very popular plot nationwide. Ian proposed to Adam and the pair entered a civil partnership on 14 December 2006. In mid-2012, Adam suffered a blow to the head while attempting to stop a robbery, but has since recovered. Once again, Adam and Ian contemplated parenthood; in 2019, surrogate and friend Lexi gave birth to Alexander Macy- Craig (Xander). https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1dsxPtNcCzZZ40ztZbjPFrz/lexi- viktorova Debbie Aldridge, formerly Gerrard, n√©e Travers-Macy (born 24 December 1970) (Tamsin Greig) is the daughter of Jennifer and Roger Travers- Macy, but chooses to use the surname of her stepfather Brian. After a spell at the University of Exeter she returned home to get away from a relationship with Canadian lecturer Simon Gerrard (Garrick Hagon); years later Debbie got involved with Simon again and in spite of Brian's forebodings they were married. However, Debbie subsequently discovered that Simon was being unfaithful, and they divorced. When Adam returned from Africa, a bout of sibling rivalry erupted: to a certain extent, this remains ongoing, although there are indications that Adam and Debbie are reaching an understanding. Debbie is currently based in Hungary, where she runs the estate owned by a consortium to which Brian belongs (this gives the actress, Tamsin Greig, who has moved on to other projects, the ability to appear in the show from time to time). She occasionally visits home; and the installation of a new webcam also allows Debbie to talk and appear to everyone via computer. Debbie briefly returned to Ambridge again in 2011 with a proposal, now implemented, to build a super intensive dairy farm, which would go on to be run by Rob Titchner. Kate Madikane, n√©e Aldridge (born 30 September 1977) (Perdita Avery, formerly played by Kellie Bright and Susie Riddell), is the elder daughter of Brian and Jennifer. Kate inherited her mother's hippie tendencies, but her narcissistic personality was unique to her. She gave birth to her daughter Phoebe in a tipi at the Glastonbury Festival. Roy Tucker is the father, with whom Phoebe lives in Ambridge. Kate emigrated to Johannesburg, South Africa where she married Lucas Madikane (Connie M'Gadzah). She had another daughter, Noluthando (\\"Nolly\\") and, born July 2007, a son, Sipho (Xhosa for 'gift'). In 2015, she returned to Ambridge, supposedly to enrol in another course at Felpersham University, but Phoebe subsequently discovered that Lucas, upon learning that Kate had been having yet another affair, had ended their marriage and thrown her out. In 2011, previous voice actor Susie Riddell returned to the show, this time playing Tracey Horrobin.'' Alice Carter, n√©e Aldridge (born 29 September 1988) (Hollie Chapman), the younger daughter of Brian and Jennifer, studied engineering at Southampton University. Her best friend is the vicar's daughter, Amy Franks. She likes horses and has a horse, Spearmint. She is friends with both Adam and Debbie. In considering joining the RAF, who ultimately rejected her application, she came into conflict with Amy's pacifist views. In 2010 she married Chris Carter (below), the farrier son of Neil and Susan. She recently graduated from Felpersham University with a master's degree and works as an aeronautical engineer. Phoebe Aldridge (Lucy Morris) was born 28 June 1998 in a tipi in the former Tipi Field at Glastonbury Festival, and lived with her father Roy Tucker and his wife Hayley until their relationship broke up in 2014. She lived with Brian and Jennifer until she became exasperated with her mother Kate's thoughtlessness during her A-levels and moved back in with Roy. She is currently studying at Oxford University. R√∫airi Donovan (born 14 November 2002) is the son of Brian Aldridge and Siobh√°n Hathaway. His persistent Irish accent ‚Äì despite his having been born and raised during his earliest years in Germany and, after only the briefest of stays with his Irish grandmother, educated for several years since then in England ‚Äì has been criticised in the BBC's Feedback programme as implausible, since young children rapidly adapt their accent to their surroundings. By 2019 his accent is not appreciably Irish. The Pargetter family Elizabeth Pargetter, n√©e Archer (Alison Dowling) is Phil and Jill's youngest daughter and, along with Kenton, at first rejected village life, attempting a career in publicity in London. She returned to Ambridge but endured a disastrous relationship with local businessman Cameron Fraser (which led to Elizabeth having an abortion) before finally marrying Nigel Pargetter after a relationship some years before. Elizabeth and Nigel developed their stately home, Lower Loxley, as a conference venue. Elizabeth, born with a heart defect, became pregnant and had twins, Lily and Freddie, but the strain of the pregnancy on her heart meant that she soon afterwards had to undergo a heart valve replacement operation. Elizabeth is highly critical of the way David manages the Brookfield estate, and is very concerned to ensure that her family receives its due portion of the estate. Elizabeth's mother-in-law Julia lived in the family pile until her demise in 2005. She was highly critical of Elizabeth, who was married to her son Nigel until his death from a fall in January 2011. Lily Rosalind and Frederick Hugo \\"Freddie\\" Pargetter (Katie Redford and Toby Laurence, formerly played by Georgie Feller and Jack Firth) are Elizabeth and Nigel's twins. They were both born on 12 December 1999 via Caesarean section because of Elizabeth's heart condition. Freddie had to stay in a special care unit for several days as he was underweight. Before his death, Nigel wanted his children to attend exams for the Felpersham Cathedral School. Lily is the more easily angered, sarcastic and pretentious twin; while Freddie, is more sweet-natured and very sensitive, though also more cocky and moody at times. In October 2018, Freddie was given a 12-month youth detention order for dealing in narcotics. The Tucker family Mike Tucker (born 1 December 1949) (Terry Molloy) lost an eye in a farming accident, for which Brian Aldridge was found responsible. He was regarded as one of the most humourless characters in the village, even before the death of his beloved wife Betty in December 2005. Mike was unsuccessful as a farmer, having gone bankrupt in 1985, and then ran a milk round in Ambridge. He also undertook occasional tree-surgery work. On New Year's Day 2007, he was run over by Helen Archer, but rescued by Robert Snell. When Tom took the blame, Tucker forbade him from continuing a relationship with Brenda, his daughter. However, after finding out that Helen was driving he became more sympathetic and apologised to Tom. His plan to split Willow Farm in two, so that Roy and Hayley can have a separate home, was initially resisted by Brenda. Mike later married Vicky, a fellow ballroom dancer, who gave birth to their daughter Bethany in January 2013. Bethany had Downs Syndrome, which led to Mike, Vicky and Bethany moving to Birmingham to ensure the best care for Bethany. Roy Tucker (born 2 February 1978) (Ian Pepperell) was formerly part of a teenage gang which perpetrated a series of racist attacks on Usha Gupta; he gave them her address. Realising the error of his ways, he went on to gain a degree in business studies at Felpersham University. He worked at Grey Gables, and was promoted to deputy manager. After Nigel Pargetter's death, he began working at Lower Loxley, initially just to assist Elizabeth. However, he was eventually offered a permanent job there. He had an on/off relationship with Kate Aldridge, which resulted in their daughter Phoebe being born in 1998, but then married Hayley. Roy, Hayley and Phoebe lived with Mike Tucker at Willow Farm. Attempts to find an affordable home for his family met with failure until Mike split Willow Farm in two. Roy had an affair with Elizabeth in 2014 which, though brief, led to the end of his marriage. Hayley Tucker, n√©e Jordan (born 1 May 1977) (Lorraine Coady, formerly played by Lucy Davis) comes from Birmingham and first appeared as John Archer's girlfriend. Initially her urban background led to her being unprepared for rural life. Hayley and John split up (partly due to John's involvement with Sharon Richards) shortly before his death in a tractor accident in 1998. Hayley took over the running of John's pig business after John's death, but eventually his brother Tom took an interest and she handed it back to the Archers. In 2001 she married John's best mate Roy Tucker and became stepmother to Phoebe; she found Kate Aldridge's visits from South Africa to Ambridge uncomfortable. Hayley worked at Lower Loxley as nanny to Freddie and Lily Pargetter, and then as a rather amorphous children's visitor specialist. Despite Betty's sudden death, Hayley remained unhappy at living with her father-in-law and wished that she and Roy had a home of their own. After an 'informational' storyline of difficulty in conceiving, Hayley gave birth to a baby daughter, Abigail (Abbie) on 7 March 2008. The birth was somewhat (the chronology as aired is contradictory) premature and Abbie was expected to remain in hospital until her original due date, although medical practice is 'until 2.5 kilos'. Hayley left Roy in 2014 after discovering the nature of his relationship with Elizabeth Pargetter. Brenda Tucker (born 21 January 1981) (Amy Shindler) has had some controversial short-term relationships, with Debbie's husband, with Lilian's then (much younger) lover and with Lilian's son. For several years she worked at Radio Borsetshire, until leaving home in 2005 to pursue a media studies degree. She returned home when her mother died suddenly in December 2005. Feeling unable to return to university, leaving her father so soon after Betty's death, she decided to transfer to Felpersham University, planning to return to her studies in September 2006. She started dating Tom Archer following a Valentine kiss after they grew closer in the weeks after her mother's death. After graduating in 2009 she was unable to gain permanent employment apart from a PR job in Leicester, necessitating a daily commute which frustrated Tom. She gave up the effort after a few weeks and joined AmsideMatt and Lilian's new property company. After feeling increasingly badly-treated by Lilian and Matt, she left Amside without notice. She ended her relationship with Tom, saying that she did not want to marry and bear children. She moved to London. The Carter family Neil Carter (born 22 May 1957) (Brian Hewlett) is another business failure. Susan wanted him to be a white collar worker but he decided that he was a pigman at heart. He used to be Tom's partner in a piggery. The family lived in a caravan, after selling their house, until he finished a self-build house on his own land. He dislikes all Grundys but especially Ed, who, until his disappearance, lived in the caravan with Emma and George. Susan Carter, n√©e Horrobin (born 10 October 1963) (Charlotte Martin), the village gossip, briefly became the most notorious Archers character ever when her imprisonment at Christmas 1993 for shielding her armed-robber brother Clive Horrobin led to the launch of the \\"Free the Ambridge One\\" campaign. Questions were asked in the House of Commons of then Home Secretary Michael Howard. Her aspirational tendencies took a hammering when daughter Emma married into the Grundy family in 2004, but in 2006 she was approved by the Royal Mail for the position of sub-postmistress despite her criminal record. She had previously worked for several years at the village shop and post office, and as Tom Archer's assistant in his sausage-making business. Clive Horrobin returned to the village to visit their dying mother in October 2011. Christopher Carter (born 22 June 1988) (Wilf Scolding, formerly played by Will Sanderson-Thwaite) is the younger offspring of the Carter family. His mother had some difficulty bonding with him when he was born with a cleft lip. Now a farrier by occupation, a few years ago he had a brief relationship with Venetia, the daughter of a prominent Borsetshire family. His mother rather desperately encouraged this, to Neil's disapproval, but the couple soon found themselves incompatible, and Christopher finished the liaison. He began seeing Alice to the barely concealed delight of his social climbing mother and the scarcely concealed horror of Alice's mother, Jennifer Aldridge. The couple married unexpectedly in Las Vegas during a 2010 summer holiday. Other Ambridge residents =Reverend Alan Franks= The motor-bike riding Alan Franks (John Telfer), the latest in a series of eccentric village vicars, was appointed to Ambridge and neighbouring parishes in 2003, moving from Nottingham where he had previously worked as an accountant and a non-stipendiary minister. He was widowed before moving to Ambridge and is the father of Amy, currently studying midwifery in Manchester. In late 2005, his blossoming relationship with Usha Gupta, a Hindu, caused some unease to some of his parishioners, including Shula Hebden Lloyd. In March 2008, Alan and Usha became engaged, to the opposition of his former mother-in-law Mabel (Mona Hammond) and Usha's Aunt Satya, and her parents. They married in summer 2008 and Usha's family have warmed to the idea and attended the wedding, though Mabel did not. =Usha Franks= Usha Franks n√©e Gupta (born 17 June 1962) formerly played by Souad Faress and by Sudha Bhuchar works as a solicitor in Felpersham and is one of very few ethnic minority characters in the series. On moving into the village, Usha was the subject of a harassment campaign by a racist gang which included Roy Tucker. To offer support and protection, the local GP, Richard Locke (William Gaminara), then her lover, moved into her house, Blossom Hill Cottage, shortly afterwards. Two members of the gang, Spanner Bridges (so called because he used a spanner (wrench) as a weapon) and Craven, were charged, and while Craven pleaded guilty and got a lesser sentence, Spanner was convicted and sentenced, his bike being sold and the proceeds given to Usha. Much later, when she discovered that Locke had slept with her best friend Shula Hebden (on an occasion when Shula was vulnerable and he took advantage of his position as family doctor) she ended the relationship and threw him out, also ending her friendship with Shula (whom she told off with relish, they are now arch-enemies). More recently, some local parishioners made complaints to the bishop when Alan, the vicar, began a relationship with Usha (who is Hindu). These two threads are linked by Shula's possible involvement in this disapproval and her resignation as churchwarden. Usha was also regularly on the receiving end of 'helpful' advice about her unmarried status by her Aunty Satya (Jamila Massey), an occasional visitor to Ambridge from Usha's home town of Wolverhampton who attempted to match-make for her on numerous occasions, with cousins from home. The character of Usha is said to be based on Kamlesh Bahl, former Vice President of the Law Society. =Bert Fry= Bert Fry (Eric Allan, formerly played by Roger Hume) (born 7 June 1936) husband of Freda Fry (deceased, formerly a silent character), was employed for many years as a farmhand by (initially) Phil, later by David and Ruth until his retirement although he still does some casual work. Bert continues to reside in \\"The Bungalow\\" which was originally built to house David and Ruth; he now has the Fairbrother boys as his tenants. His portrayal is close to a stereotypical \\"yokel\\", like Jethro Larkin and Zebedee Tring before him. The Frys did however take a holiday in India when he retired. He composes poetry and has won several ploughing contests, whilst being a regular guide at Lower Loxley. =Jazzer McCreary= Jack \\"Jazzer\\" McCreary (born 1984) (Ryan Kelly), pigman (working for Tom Archer) and milkman (working for Mike Tucker). Jazzer started out as a general ne'er do well, engaging in burglary and drug abuse, before settling down a little and holding down two jobs. While still a heavy drinker, with a profound dislike of either healthy food or housework, he has evolved into the village lothario, seducing several women on his milk round. Despite this he holds a torch for Fallon Rogers, who normally insists that they should remain friends. Occasionally Jazzer manages to surprise everyone with a sensitive side, such as when he wowed the audience of Ambridge's Got Talent with his heartfelt rendition of a Scottish folk song (Roses of Prince Charlie). Ryan Kelly is visually impaired unlike his character. =Kirsty Miller= Kirsty Miller (Annabelle Dowler), worked at Ambridge Organics and the Jaxx Bar. Kirsty was in a relationship with Tom Archer, before he broke up with her for someone else. She then dated Sam Batton, who chose to end the relationship because he was in love with Ruth Archer. In 2013, Kirsty and Tom got back together and became engaged. He jilted her at the altar. Kirsty was good friends with Tom's sister, Helen, but they fell out when Kirsty discovered that Helen had known before the wedding day Tom had doubts. She ultimately returned to Ambridge several months later, got a job at Grey Gables and moved in with Roy Tucker, while also making amends with Helen and the rest of the family. Her time away meant that she saw clearly the changes in both Helen's appearance and personality following her marriage to Rob Titchener, which immediately alerted her to the fact that something was off about them. As such, she ended up being the only person to spot the signs that he was abusing her emotionally. Eventually, after convincing Helen to meet with Jess, Rob's ex-wife, she was horrified when Helen decided to confront Rob about his behaviour, a confrontation that led to Helen stabbing him. After having a one- night stand with Tom shortly after the trial, Kirsty became pregnant with his son, and despite her initial reservations, decided to keep the baby. However, a couple of weeks later, her pregnancy ended tragically when she miscarried. After initially repressing her grief, Kirsty eventually agreed to take compassionate leave and grieved properly. Unfortunately, his handling of both the pregnancy and the miscarriage ultimately proved to be the final nail in the coffin of any lingering romantic feelings for Tom. Kirsty now lives with local builder Phillip Moss. =Fallon Rogers= Fallon Rogers (born 19 June 1985) (Joanna van Kampen), Jolene's daughter from her first marriage (to Wayne Tucson).\\"Wayne Tucson\\", BBC Radio 4 When younger, Fallon was the lead singer of local rock band, Little White Lies when not running the Upstairs@the Bull music venue and working as a barmaid. Fallon was perennially unlucky in love, either falling for men who aren't interested or having the wrong men fall for her. Jazzer McCreary and Ed Grundy were involved with Fallon at various times. Fallon runs the Bridge farm caf√© with Emma Grundy plus upcycles furniture as well as undertaking catering for local \\"do's\\". Fallon's long term relationship with and 2018 marriage to PC Harrison Burns has provided stability and she is now a fixture in village life. Fallon's drive to modernise village life has caused friction with older characters such as Lynda Snell who resigned from the 2016 f√™te committee after an argument with Fallon and with Shula Hebden Lloyd who felt pushed out of catering the village cricket teas when Fallon took over following Harrison's appointment as captain. Fallon and Harrison initially rented Woodbine Cottage from Christine Barford and having decided it was too small and were moving, they changed their minds buying the property when Christine decided to sell. =Kathy Perks= Kathy Perks (born 30 January 1953) (Hedli Niklaus), formerly married to Sid, now lives at April Cottage with her son Jamie. She was the catering manager at the local golf club and organised occasional film nights at the village hall. Kenton Archer started dating her, intermittently living with her, but they quarrelled when he brought his three-year-old daughter, Meriel, to Ambridge and expected Kathy to look after her. Miserable and alone, Kathy befriended Lower Loxley chef, Owen King (a.k.a. Gareth Taylor, Alex Wallace and latterly Marcus Dixon), but he raped her just before Christmas 2004. It took Kathy some time to trust a man again, and Kenton showed uncharacteristic patience in enabling her to rebuild her self-confidence. She finally reported her trauma to the Police in September 2007, after being informed that King had attacked another woman. He was convicted in April 2008. She has reacted to the sudden death in New Zealand of Sid, her ex-husband, as if she were the grieving widow, rather than his wife of eight years Jolene, being of little help to their teenage son and undermining her relationship with Kenton, who can do nothing right. After finding that Kenton had had a one-night stand with a customer of his bar, she threw him out. Kathy was at one time Pat Archer's best friend. She is now general manager at Grey Gables but while she is still mentioned in passing, she has not been heard for several years and appears to have become a silent character. =Lynda Snell= Lynda Snell (born 29 May 1947) (Carole Boyd) lives at Ambridge Hall with her husband Robert Snell. They moved to Ambridge from Sunningdale in 1986 and she is resented as an outsider, a do-gooder and incomer. She is a keen gardener, and was often involved in disputes with her neighbour Joe Grundy (now deceased). In 2003 she acquired two llamas, Wolfgang and Constanza (named after Mozart and his wife) which have been known to roam around the village. In May 2007 Constanza gave birth to a cria which Lynda named Salieri, reassuring one acquaintance that the legend of Salieri murdering Mozart is a myth. She attempts to produce a play every Christmas (an Archers in-joke), and often drives villagers to distraction in her attempts to fill parts. In 2004-05 Lynda ran a campaign to renovate the former Cat & Fiddle pub, but despite recruiting the help of Griff Rhys Jones, the scheme failed and the building was earmarked to become flats. In January 2006 Lynda was elected to the parish council alongside Lilian Bellamy. According to a BBC survey, she is the most annoying character on the show, although this will be regarded as praise by the production team, as she is intended to be. Prior to being injured in an explosion and fire at the Grey Gables Hotel in March 2020, Lynda was campaigning against Lilian Bellamy's plans to revamp The Bull under the title The B @ Ambridge. Lilian told a still recovering Lynda that the pub will be returning to the original name of The Bull. =Robert Snell= Robert Snell (born 5 April 1943) (Dr Graham Blockey) was employed as a computer expert. He has found work in this area hard to obtain recently and has capitalised on his DIY skills to set up a small business doing general building work. =Caroline Sterling= Caroline Sterling, n√©e Bone, formerly Pemberton (born 3 April 1955; died 2017) (Sara Coward) moved to the village in 1977, aged 22, when she was hired by Sid as barmaid in the Bull. Her career took off when in 1979 Jack Woolley offered her a job at Grey Gables and she eventually became manager. Upon Jack's retirement, she and partner Oliver Sterling managed to raise funds to buy the hotel and she became the proprietor. On her arrival she soon attracted the attention of many of the male villagers ‚Äî she once had an affair with Brian Aldridge, and was romantically linked with former village doctor, Matthew Thorogood, and businessman and one-time estate owner Cameron Fraser (who disappeared with ¬£60,000 of her savings), and she was engaged to non- stipendiary minister and vet Robin Stokes. In 1995 she married the new owner of the estate, Guy Pemberton (Hugh Dickson). After only seven months of marriage he suffered a fatal heart attack and left her the Dower House and a majority share in the Bull (which she sold to Lilian Bellamy, in order to raise funds to buy Grey Gables). When Oliver Sterling moved to the village she began an affair with him and they eventually moved into Grange Farm together. They were married in June 2006. Sara Coward died on 13 February 2017. In the episode on 11 July 2017, it was revealed that Caroline had died suddenly but peacefully at the Sterlings' second home in Italy. =Oliver Sterling= Oliver Sterling (Michael Cochrane) was married, between 2006 and her death in 2017, to Caroline. He arrived in Ambridge as a gentleman farmer and huntsman who bought Grange Farm from the estate. Initially he employed Ed Grundy to manage his dairy herd. In March 2008 he had problems with the herd being infected by Bovine TB. He subsequently sold the enterprise to Ed and \\"retired properly\\". He is now the owner of Grey Gables where he resides, and he continues to own Grange Farm with the farm house rented to Eddie and Clarrie Grundy whilst the land is rented by Ed Grundy to house some Texel sheep. =Carol Tregorran= Carol Tregorran n√©e Grey (Eleanor Bron, formerly played by Anne Cullen (born 1926)) first appeared in 1954. Carol was originally married to Ambridge landowner Charles Grenville until his death. She then, eventually, married John Tregorran. She was a successful businesswoman running a market garden in Ambridge (and subsequently a wine business). She departed in 1980, but returned to Ambridge in 2014 renting Glebe Cottage from Jill Archer, following her husband's death. During 2016 her daughter, the Birmingham barrister Anna Tregorran, successfully defended Helen Archer in the latter's trial for attempted murder. Recurring characters Clive Horrobin (born 9 November 1972) (Alex Jones) is the brother of Susan Carter; he has spent much of his life in prison, but, to the consternation of many, is an occasional visitor to Ambridge. He conducted an armed siege at the village shop in 1993, in 1997 assaulted gamekeeper George Barford knocking him unconscious and set fire to the Barford's home gutting the building in 2004. In October 2011, he returned to the village to visit his ailing mother.\\"Clive Horrobin\\" , The Archers, BBC Radio 4, 4 October 2011 In late 2012, Clive was sent back to prison after breaking the terms of his licence and entering Ambridge to confront his sister, Tracy, and his brother's wife, Donna. Satya Khanna (Auntie Satya; Jamila Massey) An occasional visitation upon long- suffering niece Usha Gupta. Forever trying to give Usha unwanted relationship advice or a welcome shoulder to cry on, and architect of numerous failed matchmaking ruses. Thanks to Usha's parents' disapproval toward their daughter's lifestyle, Satya provides the main link with her family. No mean cook, Satya often arrives bearing food parcels for her culinarily inept niece. Iftikar Shah (Pal Aron) is a maths teacher, who runs Cricket coaching sessions for Ambridge residents. Believed to be 29 years old and born in Stechford, Birmingham. Former principal characters Over the years some of the original cast members have died, left the show or retired and their characters have had to be replaced or killed off by the scriptwriters. =Archer family and relations= Daniel \\"Dan\\" Archer (Harry Oakes, Monte Crick, Edgar Harrison and Frank Middlemass), son of the elder John Archer, was the first owner of Brookfield when the family bought it from Squire Lawson-Hope. He was patriarch of the Archer family. The character survived the deaths of the first three actors before finally being killed off in 1986. Elizabeth witnessed his fatal attempt to rescue a sheep in difficulty, despite her pleading with him not to. Doris Evelyn Rebecca Archer (Gwen Berryman), n√©e Forrest, Dan's wife and mother of Phil Archer and his siblings. Her death was discovered by Shula in 1980, when she and Christine were visiting Glebe Cottage. Doris was a stalwart of village life, and provided a listening ear to an ever-growing Archer family from the 1950s to 1980. She was originally a kitchen maid at Manor House, the ancestral home of the Lawson-Hope family; and she became lady's maid to Letty Lawson-Hope. Jack Archer (Denis Folwell) (John Archer), son of Dan, elder brother of Phil and Christine, first husband of Peggy, n√©e Perkins, later Woolley, father of Jennifer, Lillian and Tony: died 1972 of liver failure. Jack and Peggy managed (and later owned) the Bull, and Jack had suffered increasingly from alcoholism and excessive gambling. Phil Archer (Norman Painting) younger son of Dan, and long-time patriarch of the Archer family and a leading resident of the village. Phil Archer died on 12 February 2010. Grace Archer (Monica Grey and Ysanne Churchman) was Phil Archer's first wife and the first major character to be killed off. The episode featuring her death was first broadcast on 22 September 1955. The previous night, which happened to be the night that ITV, the UK's first commercial television channel was launched, she received fatal injuries, trying to rescue her horse, Midnight, from a fire. This was seen as a ploy to keep loyal viewers and listeners away from the new station. Her catchphrase was \\"one fried egg or two, Phil?\\" Aunt Laura (Gwenda Wilson and Betty McDowall), New Zealander widow of Dan's younger (of 2) brothers Frank; she fulfilled a similar dramatic role to Lynda Snell who now lives in Aunt Laura's former home, Ambridge Hall. In 1985, Aunt Laura fell in a ditch and listeners were treated to her forlorn cries while owls hooted overhead. She was found alive and spent a week in hospital being treated for pneumonia, but died of heart failure soon after being discharged on St Valentine's Day, while her friend Freddy Danby read to her from Moby-Dick. Tom Forrest (George Hart and Bob Arnold) was Doris Archer's brother and a gamekeeper. He was a major character for many years and used to introduce the omnibus edition on Sunday mornings. In 1957, he was charged with manslaughter after shooting poacher Bob Larkin. He was cleared at trial. Mark Charles Timothy Hebden (Richard Derrington), first husband of Shula Archer. Died in a road accident. Julia Pargetter-Carmichael, mother of Nigel Pargetter (she also had a daughter called Camilla who wasn't seen); mother in-law of Elizabeth Archer (whom she disliked at first, because she wanted Nigel to marry into the wealthy Aldridge family, but grew to love Elizabeth later on after the birth of her beloved grandchildren, Freddie and Lily) and sometime entertainer, died from a stroke in 2005, shortly after the actress who played her, Mary Wimbush, died, also from a stroke, aged 81. Nigel Gerald Pargetter (8 June 1959 - January 2011) (played by Graham Seed, formerly by Nigel Caliburn who is now known as Nigel Carrington) was the eccentric pseudo-aristocratic owner of Lower Loxley Hall, a mansion on the outskirts of Ambridge. Making his debut in 1983, he was once considered to be somewhat dim and irresponsible, wearing a gorilla suit at a hunt ball in 1983, inadvertently joy riding with Shula Archer in 1984 and driving an ice-cream van as 'Mr Snowy' in 1986. Initially, Nigel was romantically linked with Shula (or \\"Shulie\\" as he called her), but in 1984 he became involved with Elizabeth Archer, finding her totally unlike Shula: she tricked him into helping her abscond from school in September 1984. On the death of his father a few years later, he strove to save his ancestral home, and involved Elizabeth, now also more mature, as his marketing manager. He saved the hall for his family. Married to Elizabeth for some years and the father of twins Lily and Freddie (born 12 December 1999), he was convicted of drink-driving in 2003. Nigel (who also had a never-seen sister, Camilla who was married to a man named James) had only intermittent help from his beloved mother, Julia; more often she was a source of anxiety and friction (due to her dislike of Elizabeth, which, happily ceased once Freddie and Lily were born), but she died suddenly in November 2005. Nigel developed a number of vague resemblances to Prince Charles. He became concerned about the environment and tried to become \\"green\\". He also took an interest in his family history, particularly in his late Uncle Rupert. Nigel died after falling from the roof of Lower Loxley Hall while attempting, after an evening party, to take down a New Year's banner in icy conditions. The accident occurred as part of The Archers 60th anniversary broadcast on 2 January 2011. Nigel's demise was satirised in Radio 4's News Quiz Christmas Pantomime in December of that year. =Other major characters= Marjorie Antrobus (Margot Boyd) was from a colonial background in Kenya; she was the widow of Teddy. She gave a talk to the Ambridge Women's Institute in 1984, and moved into Nightingale Farm in 1985. A breeder of Afghan hounds, Marjorie let out her flat at Nightingale Farm to Ruth and later to Roy and Hayley. She was an occasionally bossy, but well-meaning do-gooder in the village. After moving to The Laurels retirement home, she was a silent character for several years before her death was finally mentioned on 13 August 2008. (Margot Boyd died on 20 May 2008.) Mrs Perkins, known as \\"Mrs P\\" (Pauline Seville). Widowed friend of Dan and Doris Archer, and sometime good-natured enemy of Walter Gabriel She was the mother of Peggy Archer, who married Dan and Doris's son, Jack. Walter Gabriel (Robert Mawdesley and Chris Gittins), originally a smallholder, was a friend of the Archers and provided comic relief in the years before the Grundy family were given greater prominence. Walter continually tried to romance Mrs Perkins, Peggy's mother, whom he referred to as \\"Mrs. P\\". Walter Gabriel's phrase \\"Me old pal, me old beauty\\" remains one of the most enduringly remembered phrases associated with The Archers. He died shortly after his 92nd birthday and the death of the actor Chris Gittins. Nelson Gabriel (Jack May), Walter's son, was for many years the most disreputable character in the village. He had a shady history. He was charged with the Borchester mail-van robbery in 1967, but was eventually acquitted. After spells in London and Spain, he opened a wine bar in Borchester in 1980 and later an antique shop (with Kenton Archer). Finally he suddenly disappeared to South America, where he died in strange circumstances. He had an illegitimate daughter, Rosemary Tarrant, who when she found and introduced herself to him revealed she had become a policewoman. Sid Perks (Alan Devereux) was landlord of The Bull, Ambridge's village pub. He first came to Ambridge from Birmingham where he had been sent to borstal for breaking and entering, which made obtaining his publican's licence difficult. He was devastated when his much-loved wife, Polly (\\"Poll doll\\") was killed in a car crash. His subsequent marriage to Kathy ended in divorce, but his third marriage, to his affair partner, country singer Jolene, was happier. He displayed vitriolic homophobia towards Sean Myerson, a professional rival, when the latter captained the village cricket team, and again when Adam Macy began a relationship with Ian Craig, the Grey Gables chef. In early 2006, Sid and Jolene were concerned that the decision of Caroline Pemberton to sell her controlling interest in The Bull would threaten the pub's future, but were relieved when Lilian bought her share. Sid died of a heart attack on 8 June 2010, while on holiday in New Zealand, visiting Lucy, his daughter by his first marriage. John Tregorran (Roger Hume, Basil Jones, Simon Lack and Philip Morant) originally arrived in Ambridge in a gypsy caravan. Thoughtful and provocative, Tregorran was such a popular and charismatic character that listeners at Archers public events still ask about him ‚Äî and about Carol Grey, whom he eventually married. Tregorran was the author with Jennifer Aldridge of Ambridge: an English village through the ages (really written by William Smethurst); London: Borchester Press in association with Methuen by arrangement with the British Broadcasting Corporation, 1982. Tregorran died in July 2014 and was buried in Ambridge. His widow returned for the funeral and decided to move back to the village. Betty Tucker (Pamela Craig) wife of Mike, mother of Roy and Brenda. Betty was a popular villager who supported the family even when Mike was violent and depressed. Betty managed the village shop and kept hens and gossiped. An attractive woman, she distinguished herself by successfully resisting the advances of erstwhile village Lothario, Brian Aldridge. Betty died suddenly before Christmas 2005. She was written out of the series when the actress who played her retired and emigrated to New Zealand. Jack Woolley (19 July 1919 - 2 January 2014) (Arnold Peters, formerly played by Philip Garston-Jones) was a self-made man originally from Stirchley in Birmingham who owned the village shop. He also once owned local country- house hotel Grey Gables (now owned by Oliver Sterling who acquired it along with his late wife Caroline), the Borchester Echo (a local newspaper) and other businesses outside the village. He was married to Peggy Woolley until his death (see below). Jack suffered increasingly from Alzheimer's disease and received treatment for it, which led Peggy to take more responsibility for the day-to-day operations of his businesses. In 2005 Peggy tried to persuade her husband to agree to his affairs being governed by power of attorney. At the same time, Jack Woolley's adopted daughter Hazel (various actresses, on this occasion Annette Badland) came over from the United States, after some years of absence. Using the cover of an Internet business and an imaginary step family, she failed in an attempt to con Jack and Peggy and gain control of the Grey Gables hotel and leisure complex. As Jack's condition deteriorated, and after much sensitively presented soul searching on the part of Peggy, he was moved into residential care at The Willows in 2009, and then suffered a stroke. Jack became a 'silent character' in 2011.\\"Arnold Peters, Archers actor, dies\\", BBC News, 13 May 2013 He died on 2 January 2014. Heather Pritchard (Margaret Jackman, formerly played by Joyce Gibbs) Ruth Archer's widowed mother who lived in Prudhoe, Northumberland. She returned to Ambridge in 2008 to look after the family when Ruth had her breast reconstruction surgery and was also in contact with Professor Jim Lloyd, Alistair's father. She returned in 2010 for Phil Archer's funeral, and in 2014 after Ruth's miscarriage. Following a succession of strokes, Heather died en route while moving down to Ambridge on 28 September 2015, after reluctantly leaving her Prudhoe home. =Friends and lovers= Sophie Barlow (Moir Leslie) a fashion designer who was once engaged to David and once involved much of Ambridge in her fashion shows. A few years later, the same actress played the vicar, Janet Fisher, but after Fisher had in turn been written out, Barlow herself reappeared in August 2006. She flirted with David and made a play to have an affair with him, having been resistant to intimacy before. When the reality of her flirting dawned on the na√Øf David he backed away and Barlow returned to London. David's wife Ruth had meanwhile in exasperation at David's apparent affair fallen in love with the farm's contractor Sam. Colonel Freddy Danby (Norman Shelley and Ballard Berkeley) lodged with Laura Archer at Ambridge Hall. A widower, he always wanted to marry her, but it was not to be. When she died, her property was left to a New Zealand relative, and the colonel was cut out. He eventually left the village to live with an old Army friend in Bristol. Siobhan Donovan (formerly Hathaway, Caroline Lennon) moved into Honeysuckle Cottage in 1999 with her husband, new local doctor Tim Hathaway. Their marriage came under strain when Siobhan miscarried a much-wanted baby and Tim became close to Ambridge's vicar Janet Fisher. It collapsed completely after Tim discovered Siobhan's affair with Brian Aldridge. On 14 November 2002, Siobhan gave birth to Brian's child Ruair√≠, but she moved to Germany after Brian refused to leave Jennifer. Siobhan made occasional appearances in The Archers when Brian made clandestine visits to Germany to see his son, while supposedly on business trips to Hungary. Siobhan's revelation in 2007 that she had terminal cancer, and her request to Brian to care for Ruair√≠ after her death, brought another crisis to the relationship of Brian and Jennifer, who eventually agreed to Brian's request for them to raise Ruair√≠ together. She died from cancer on 31 May 2007. and Ruair√≠ came to Ambridge to live with his father, although much of his care falls, not without a struggle, on his father's wife, Jennifer. The circumstances of Ruair√≠'s arrival briefly engulfed the village in gossip and, for some, scandal. Carl (Nicholas Bailey) is Amy Franks's ex-boyfriend. When Amy asked Carl about moving into together, he broke up with her. Amy later learnt that Carl was married, and a rift developed between her and Usha after it emerged that Usha had already known this. Eventually, Amy attempted to get Carl back, but he cruelly brushed her off. =Recurring villagers= Janet Fisher (Moir Leslie), the former vicar of Ambridge and surrounding villages, was a close friend of Shula Archer. Ambridge was one of the first parishes to have a female incumbent. Janet's time as vicar led the conservative Peggy Woolley to attend services at All Saints' in Borchester until she left the parish. When Janet left, Peggy returned to St. Stephen's. While Janet was vicar, Peggy complimented her on the tasteful way she handled services, but she still attended services in Borchester. Jethro Larkin (George Hart), Stereotypical yokel. His tenure came to end in 1987 when helping David fell a tree using a chainsaw. So two Larkin family members, Jethro and Bob, have met their end at the hands of members of the Archer family (see under Tom Forrest). Father of Clarrie. Ned Larkin (Bill Payne) Ned, father of Jethro, was a farmhand at Brookfield, and a friend of Walter Gabriel. Zebedee Tring (Graham Rigby) was a roadman and friend of Jethro Larkin's dad, Ned. In 2013, a wealthy American descendant of his made contact with the Vicarage enquiring about his ancestor Zebedee, and subsequently made a large donation towards the repair of the village organ. Annette Turner (born September 1990) (Anne-Marie Piazza) Teenage daughter of the late Greg Turner. Has been living in France with her mother Michelle and sister Sonia but after family upheavals returned to England to seek out Helen Archer. In February 2010 she suddenly disappeared from the series to stay with a grandmother in Sheffield. It was her pregnancy (by Helen's boyfriend Leon, though this was never revealed to Helen) and subsequent termination, that precipitated Helen's decision, at thirty, to have a baby by donor insemination. Martha Woodford (Mollie Harris) Shopkeeper, husband of Joby. Sean Myerson (Gareth Armstrong) Landlord of the former pub The Cat and Fiddle. Amy Franks (born 1989) (Jennifer Daley, formerly played by Vinette Robinson and Natalia Cappuccini) is the vicar's spirited daughter who is a friend to Alice Carter. Catherine, her late mother, was of African-Caribbean descent. Amy qualified as a midwife in Manchester and now works at Borchester General Hospital. She was responsible for spotting the signs of pre-eclampsia in the pregnant Helen Archer and probably saving the life of mother and unborn son, Henry. She was recently in a relationship with Carl, a man who seemed too good to be true. He was, having concealed his marriage from her, and only wanting a fling. Usha, her step mother, discovered Carl's marriage but failed to warn Amy about him, which caused a serious rift between them, and to a lesser degree, her father. After finally realising the degree to which Carl had abused her trust things seem to be improving at home. She eventually moved to be closer to her work and has not been heard from in some years. =Villains and rogues= Matt Crawford (born 7 August 1947) (Kim Durham) He threw his weight around and become more or less hated by all. He was for some years the chairman of Borchester Land, a property development company. An outsider by birth, Matt often inveigled himself into positions of power, such as the parish council, but many villagers were suspicious of his motives. For example, when local vet Alistair owed him a gambling debt, Matt said that he would reduce the amount he owed in exchange for the administration of performance-enhancing drugs to one of his racehorses. Alistair refused, and Crawford increased the pressure, forcing Alistair and Shula to take out a mortgage on the stables, which they already owned. Many years later this caused a rift between Alistair and his by then business partner Anisha Patel. In 2005, Matt divorced his wife Yvette and moved in with his new partner Lilian Bellamy (n√©e Archer, daughter of Peggy Woolley). In this romance she calls him \\"Tiger\\" and he calls her \\"Pussy-cat\\". In early 2008, Crawford and Lilian were briefly separated when she suspected him of having an affair with a Borchester Land board member Annabelle Scrivener (Julia Hills). The following year Crawford was indicted for fraud, having made a business guarantee he knew was false. He was persuaded to co-operate with the authorities (in contrast with his less scrupulous colleague Stephen \\"Chalkie\\" Chalkman), but on practically the eve of the trial he fled in panic to Costa Rica, planning to live there as a fugitive. However, Lilian's unhappiness in prospective exile persuaded him to return, and he served an 18-month prison sentence. Upon his release on probation he created a new property development company, created with Lilian as director to circumvent his disqualification. Lillian took a more active role than he expected which caused some friction. Matt and Lilian's relationship ultimately came to an end in early 2015. Subsequent to Lilian having a brief affair with Matt's estranged brother Paul, (which she did not find out Matt knew about until later), Lilian arrived home from a holiday to discover that he had emptied out all of their joint holdings, ransacked their house of valuables and fled to Costa Rica. In April 2017, Matt made a surprise re-appearance, claiming to have returned to Ambridge in order to repay his debt to Lillian. Tim Beecham (Tim Brierley and David Parfitt), an old friend of Nigel Pargetter. Once well known for persistently failing his law exams. Nigel and Shula found themselves in court in 1984 for taking a car they erroneously believed to be Beecham's. Now a silent and seldom mentioned character. In April 2017, he attended Elizabeth Pargetter's 50th birthday party, but wasn't heard to speak. Cameron Fraser (Delaval Astley) came to Ambridge in 1990 when he bought the Berrow Estate from Lilian Bellamy. He became quite the local villain during his relatively brief tenure: Mike Tucker lost an eye in an accident, Caroline Bone (later Sterling) and Marjorie Antrobus were swindled out of a sizeable portion of their savings, and a pregnant Elizabeth Archer was abandoned at a motor service station as he fled overseas to escape arrest. He had also attempted to rape Shula Archer. Simon Pemberton (Peter Wingfield), Guy Pemberton's caddish son, inherited the estate after his father's death. Pemberton unsuccessfully attempted to end the Grundy's tenancy of Grange Farm following their farm fire in 1996. He had a brief relationship with Shula after Mark's death, but hit her after she confronted him with evidence that he was involved with another woman. Subsequently, he came close to having a relationship with Debbie Aldridge, but Pemberton assaulted her after she confessed that she could not love him. Pemberton then quickly left Ambridge after denying responsibility for his actions to Brian. Rob Titchener (Timothy Watson) moved to Ambridge in January 2013 to manage Borchester Land's intensive dairy enterprise. That same July, Helen Archer began an affair with Rob despite knowing he was married. Only 3 months later and despite passionate pleas from Helen, he ended it to \\"make a go of things\\" with Jess Titchener, his current wife. Jess moved in on Halloween but left Ambridge in December after a disastrous cocktail party and went back to Hampshire, leaving Rob. Helen resumed her affair with Rob on New Year's Day 2014. They have since been secretly engaged and Rob has become increasingly controlling over Helen, much to her mother Pat's dismay. Jess had a baby which she claimed is Rob's until he consented to a DNA test which proved otherwise, and they were soon divorced. Rob and Helen married secretly on the Isle of Wight in August 2015. It was then that Rob revealed himself to be manipulative, emotionally abusive. After drugging and raping her on their wedding night, he spent the next several months isolating Helen from her family and friends, employing gaslighting methods to convince her that she was the one who was being problematic, and even made plans to send Henry to boarding school without Helen's knowledge or consent, with the assistance of his mother, Ursula (played by Carolyn Jones), herself a victim of coercive control with Rob's father, Bruce. In April 2016, after the secret intervention of her friend, Kirsty Miller, Helen met secretly with Jess, who revealed the true nature of her marriage with Rob, before stabbing Rob in a moment of clarity,after he placed a knife in her hand and goaded her to commit suicide, as he refused to let her and Henry leave the house. Rob barely survived the encounter. Subsequently, Rob and his mother, Ursula, tricked Pat and Tony into handing Henry over to them, forcing them into a lengthy legal battle over his custody. After a long and intense trial, during which the truth of Rob's abusive nature was exposed publicly, as well as the revelation that he had raped Helen, she was acquitted on both counts of attempted murder and Grievous Bodily Harm. Subsequently, Rob found himself becoming a pariah in the village; with Usha evicting him from the house he rented from her, Oliver banning him from the local hunt, local shops refusing his custom, and villagers openly expressing their distaste for him. It was also revealed shortly afterwards that the previous year, while still manager of the mega dairy, Rob had blocked a nearby culvert to prevent a build-up of rainwater from flooding the dairy, and was therefore responsible for the massive flood that had engulfed Ambridge and nearly causing the death of his superior. After this information was brought to the attention of Rob's new boss, Justin Elliott, he was sacked. After an attempt to kidnap his son from Helen failed, Rob disappeared, and was last reported boarding a flight to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had previously worked. Silent characters The Archers is famous for its silent characters, who often play important roles in the narrative despite not being played by actors. They are numerous, and most only \\"appear\\" once or twice. Some of the better known are: Baggy, and Fat Paul ‚Äî disreputable friends of Eddie Grundy. Snatch Foster was formerly also a friend of Eddie Grundy, but ended up in prison for selling condemned meat to him. Bailey, or Baillie ‚Äî spelling uncertain, Ian's second in command in the Grey Gables kitchen. His or her gender was not specified for some considerable time, but definitely referred to as 'he' by Oliver Sterling in the Xmas Eve episode. Barry, barman at The Bull, given to popping crisp packets during slow shifts, and sporting a 'manbun' among other remarkable fashion statements. Bob Pullen ‚Äî nonagenarian resident of Manorfield Close. His weak bladder was a regular source of amusement to speaking characters. Mr. Pullen died in late 2012. Derek Fletcher ‚Äî \\"incomer\\" (only been in Ambridge since 1979) who lives on the Glebelands housing development. A former chair of the parish council, he is known for his 'NIMBY' views and collection of garden gnomes. In a standing joke, he is often described as excessively talkative (which is ironic, given his status as a silent character). Edgar Titcombe ‚Äî head gardener at Lower Loxley, who is married to the widowed Mrs. Pugsley. Noted for always wearing a battered hat. Known universally as simply 'Titcombe'. Eileen Titcombe (formerly Pugsley) ‚Äî housekeeper at Lower Loxley. Known for many years as just 'Mrs Pugsley', until her marriage to Titcombe. Freda Fry ‚Äî wife of Bert Fry. Her cooking at The Bull was widely admired. Until she gave her notice in January 2007, she worked as a cleaner at Brookfield. She died of pneumonia in the wake of the \\"Great Ambridge Flood\\" of 2015. Jean Harvey ‚Äî appeared in the 2015 Christmas production of Calendar Girls broadcast on Sunday 27 December 2015 at 7.15pm (played by Si√¢n Phillips but was never heard on The Archers itself). She lives at Bull Farm. Peter ‚Äî Partner of Sean Myerson who was the landlord of the Cat and Fiddle pub. Jessica ‚Äî buxom falconer at Lower Loxley. Was known to have attracted Nigel Pargetter's eye. (John) Higgs ‚Äî Jack Woolley's chauffeur and handyman at Grey Gables. Often thought by Grey Gables staff to be rather sinister. Mandy Beesborough ‚Äî Brian missed his daughter Alice's birth because he was at the races with her. She has daughters including India, whom Oliver and Caroline's foster child Carly described as having \\"an arse the size of a continent\\". Neville Booth (bellringer) and his nephew Nathan (clear skies enthusiast and parish council candidate). Sabrina and Richard Thwaite ‚Äî Residents of the salubrious Grange Spinney. Richard, a commuting accountant, rarely gets a mention beyond his involvement in the cricket team. Sabrina's somewhat extreme competitive streak, especially (though by no means exclusively) when it comes to sporting activities, gets her featured at least twice a month. Often discussed in male only company due to her 'physical attributes'. In December 2010, Sabrina was heard when she played the part of the cat in the village pantomime Dick Whittington - however, she was only heard to make cat noises and didn't have any lines. Shane ‚Äî did the cooking at Nelson's winebar in the 1980s. He was famed for his legendary quiche. Trudy Porter ‚Äî silent for 34 years, until 4 April 2006, when listener Christine Hunt played her in a charity special, after her husband paid ¬£17,000 to Children in Need. Tilly and Molly Button ‚Äî Sisters of indeterminate age (Molly, the older of the two, is hinted to be in her mid teenage years), who in recent times seem to have supplanted the Horrobins as the village malefactors. However, their misdeeds tend toward relatively harmless mischief-making, rather than criminal activity (although on one occasion, they committed criminal damage by vandalizing Rob Titchener's car, and it was eventually established that they were the 'bunting thieves'). Molly Button has a degree of terpsichorean talent and is often mentioned in the context of village performances. Animals Numerous animals have been repeatedly referred to during The Archers' run ‚Äì usually played by the special effects department as necessary: * Bartleby Joe Grundy's pony pulls his trap around the area. Likes carrots and getting his oats. * Bill and Ben Two kittens given by Joe to Peggy.

Plot In 1915, at the airdrome in France of 59 Squadron Royal Flying Corps, Major Brand (Basil Rathbone), the squadron leader and his adjutant Phipps (Donald Crisp) anxiously await the return of the dawn patrol. Brand is near his breaking point. He has lost 16 pilots in the previous two weeks, nearly all of them young replacements with little training and no combat experience. Brand is ordered to send up tomorrow what amounts to a suicide mission. Captain Courtney (Errol Flynn), leader of A Flight, and his good friend \\"Scotty\\" Scott (David Niven) return but two of the replacements are not so lucky and another, Hollister, is severely depressed by having witnessed the death of his best friend. The survivors repair to the bar in their mess for drinks and fatalistic revelry. Courtney does his best to console Hollister but the youngster breaks down in grief. When Brand announces the next day's dawn patrol, Courtney tells Brand he does not have enough men. Brand retorts that more replacements are on the way. From the four green pilots, Courtney picks the two with the most flying hours to go on the mission. Only four return this time; Scott has been lost along with the two new men. Courtney tells a sympathetic Brand that Scott went down saving Hollister. Just then, British troops bring in the German who downed Scott, Hauptmann von Mueller (Carl Esmond). Courtney overcomes his initial rage when Brand informs von Mueller that it was Courtney who shot him down and the German graciously acknowledges him. Courtney then offers the German a drink. The guilt-ridden Hollister tries to attack the prisoner, but is restrained. Then, a grimy Scotty appears. B Flight is mauled next. Just after its wounded leader, Captain Squires (Michael Brooke), informs the squadron that the dreaded von Richter is now their foe, an enemy aircraft flies low over their aerodrome and drops a pair of trench boots. Attached is a taunting note telling the British pilots that they will be safer on the ground. Brand warns his men that the boots are intended to incite inexperienced pilots into trying to retaliate. He forbids any take offs without orders. Courtney and Scott disregard the prohibition, taking off in the dawn mist after stealing the boots from Brand's room. They fly to von Richter's airfield, where the black- painted fighters are being readied for the day. Courtney and Scott bomb and strafe the field, destroying most of the German aircraft and shoot down two which try to take to the air. Courtney then drops the boots. Von Richter retrieves them and shakes his fist at the departing British. Courtney is shot down recrossing the lines, then rescued by Scott, whose aircraft is also hit by anti-aircraft fire. When leaking oil blinds Scott, Courtney talks him down to a crash landing behind their own trenches. Brand's outrage at their disobedience dissipates when headquarters congratulates him for the success of the attack and promotes him \\"up to Wing\\". Brand takes cruel pleasure in naming Courtney to take command of 59 Squadron. Soon, Courtney is forced to acquire all the qualities he hated in Brand. When Scott's younger brother Donnie is posted as a replacement, Scott begs Courtney to give him a few days so that he can teach his brother the ropes. Courtney tells him there can be no exceptions. Unbeknownst to Scott, Courtney calls headquarters to plead for a few days of training for his replacements but is turned down. Von Richter shoots down Donnie in flames the next morning, for which Scott blames Courtney. Brand gives Courtney orders for a very important mission. An aircraft must fly low and bomb a huge munitions dump behind the lines. Brand bans Courtney from flying the mission, so Scott disdainfully volunteers. They reconcile and Courtney gets his friend too drunk to fly, then blows up the dump himself. Afterwards, von Richter intercepts Courtney,who outflies and shoots down two of the Germans, including von Richter but killed by a third pilot. Command of the squadron devolves to Scott. He lines up the depleted squadron for orders just as five replacements arrive. He stoically tells A Flight to be ready for the dawn patrol.

Miller, in conjunction with director Edmund Goulding, although following the original closely and crediting original co-writer Dan Totheroh, primarily rewrote dialogue to incorporate the characters played by Flynn, Rathbone and Niven. The proposal for the remake came from producer Hal Wallis to Jack L. Warner in a memo dated April 30, 1938, to financially exploit public awareness of impending war brought on by the German annexation of Austria the month before.Kennedy 2004, p. 174. Goulding was available to direct after being taken off the filming of Jezebel in favor of William Wyler.Kennedy 2004, p. 173. Warner had hired Goulding in 1937 on a per-film basis after Louis B. Mayer had fired him from MGM Studios in a sex scandal,Kennedy 2004, p. 163. and offered him the Dawn Patrol assignment to keep him interested while he completed preparations for filming Dark Victory, which he also wanted Goulding to direct.Kennedy 2004, pp. 174‚Äì175. Although Goulding detested remakes, he had successfully filmed a remake of one of his own films as his first Warner Brothers project and agreed. The film featured an entirely male cast,Kennedy 2004, p. 177. and all 12 credited roles of characters in the 59th Squadron were filled by actors with British backgrounds. One of the many fellow Englishman actors cast by Goulding was his house-mate, Michael Brooke (the 7th Earl of Warwick), while Rathbone and Flynn were selected because of their recent appearance together in The Adventures of Robin Hood.Kennedy 2004, p. 175. Goulding's biographer Matthew Kennedy wrote: > Everyone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer ... The filming > of Dawn Patrol was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and > dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of > humor ... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than > Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the > beautiful English manners of the cutterups.

Built by Claude Flagg, these \\"LF-1\\"s were constructed from Nieuport plans and had many characteristics of the actual aircraft, including upper wing fabric that ripped during dives. In Goulding's production, these aircraft also appear in a few scenes of Nieuports taking off, landing and taxiing. Additional Nieuport 28s were simulated by Thomas-Morse S-4C Scouts, and two were used in the flying scene in which Courtney and Scott attack the German airdrome. 59th Squadron's aircraft were marked in standard RFC camouflage and national insignia, had the marking \\"NIEU 24\\" painted on their tail fins, and displayed a cartoon Hornet painted on each side of the fuselage just behind the cockpit. For scenes at the German airdrome in which aircraft were moved or had engines turning, Goulding used \\"Wichita Fokkers\\" painted black with German markings. His \\"Pfalzes\\" had their wings painted in a large and striking red and white checkerboard pattern. Goulding also acquired two genuine Pfalz D.XII fighters for static closeup shots of parked fighters, with at least one repainted white in a later scene to \\"expand\\" their numbers. Actual Nieuport 28s and Pfalz D.XIIs were used much later in the war than the 1915 setting of The Dawn Patrol, while the model 28 Nieuport was not used by the RFC at all, but their familiarity of appearance to American audiences gave a verisimilitude to both films. Some of the aerial footage from both the 1930 and 1938 film was reused (specifically Flynn's doomed solo bombing mission) in the beginning sequences of Warner's British Intelligence, a 1940 World War I spy film starring Boris Karloff. Theme The original script developed for Howard Hawks, which Edmund Goulding followed closely, stressed thematic elements that came to be associated with the \\"Hawksian world\\" of \\"pressure cooker\\" situations: a professional group of men who live by a code and face death with bravado and camaraderie; the responsibility of leadership in perilous situations; a preference for individual initiative over orders; suicidal missions; and the grandeur of aerial flight.McCarthhy 2000, p. 116. =Visual motifs= The Dawn Patrol uses four scene elements as visual motifs to describe a cyclical nature to war and a nightmarish quality in being in command. Each scene places the viewer in the commander's place, waiting with dread for the inevitable consequences. Nearly all action scenes in The Dawn Patrol cut away before the conclusion is played out to heighten the sense of dread. Each scene's recurrence has differences that accentuate those consequences: * Counting the sounds of the motors of the returning aircraft to determine how many have died. In the final scenario, when Scott waits to hear Courtney's motor in the dark, his initial joy that Courtney has returned is crushed by what is, in fact, an enemy plane flying overhead to drop his dead comrade's goggles and helmet. * Receiving orders for the next mission by telephone, with the general's voice barely audible but impatient in tone. The apparent insanity of the orders is emphasized by the callous implacability of the distant, detached headquarters. * Arrival of replacements in time to enable the next mission but never with time to train them to protect themselves. The poignancy of their eager youthfulness is symbolized by their arrival in an open touring car in a seemingly endless parade. * Assembling the pilots to issue the orders, with new men ushered into line just after their arrival. Brand, Courtney and Scott, all of whom would rather be flying the mission than ordering it, assume an identical stoicism as they undergo the ordeal. =Music= The 1930 version of The Dawn Patrol is notable for its lack of background music.\\"The Dawn Patrol a.k.a. Flight Commander.\\" The Oscar Site. Retrieved: April 1, 2009. The 1938 remake not only added a score by Max Steiner, but uses several songs to set moods. Although not published until 1916 and therefore an anachronism, the melancholy \\"Poor Butterfly\\" is played on a gramophone in scenes in which the pilots drink to drown their sorrows. Tellingly, \\"Poor Butterfly\\" begins in the background just as Scotty greets the arrival of his younger brother. The pilots themselves frequently sing \\"Hurrah for the Next Man That Dies\\"‚Äîand teach it to their German guest‚Äîas a grimly sardonic defiance of death. The song was a popular World War I drinking song, and an adaptation of the poem Indian Revelry, by W.F. Thompson, about British soldiers struck down by the Plague in India. Finally, each arrival of new replacements is announced by their cheerful singing of \\"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag\\", demonstrating their callow eagerness.\\"The Dawn Patrol (1938) - Soundtrack.\\" IMDb. Retrieved: March 31, 2009. In addition, the flyers' carousing nature is emphasized in one scene with music. After Scott's return, he and Courtney drive off in a motorcycle sidecar boisterously singing \\"Plum and Apple\\" with their enlisted driver. This was an enlisted men's/other ranks' ditty about the class distinctions of rations at the front.York 2007, p. 234. Reception With another world war threatening, the pacifistic script of The Dawn Patrol was well received by audiences and critics.\\"Seton I. Miller.\\" filmreference.com. Retrieved: April 1, 2009. The film was one of Warner Bros. most popular movies of 1939. According to Warner Bros. records, it earned $1,313,000 domestically and $872,000 foreign. Variety echoed many of the critics' reactions: \\"Dawn Patrol sparkles because of vigorous performances of the entire cast and Edmund Goulding's sharp direction. Story [by John Monk Saunders] is reminiscent of previous yarns about the flying service at the front during the World War. Yet it is different in that it stresses the unreasonableness of the 'brass hats' - the commanders seated miles from the front who dispatched the 59th Squadron to certain death in carrying out combat assignments.\\"\\"Review: The Dawn Patrol\\".

He was one of the most prolific entertainers in Finland of his time, producing over 800 records in numerous genres. In late 1930s, owning a record company, he made about half of his releases under the pseudonym Matti Reima.\\"The tango\\" , an article about the Finnish tango, with a biographical inset about Malmst√©n He was the oldest of three children of a Swedish-speaking family, with Russian ancestry through his mother, Eugenie Petroff, and brother of singer and bandleader Eugen Malmst√©n. Issues with Disney George Malmst√©n made the first of his \\"Mikki-Hiiri\\" songs for his son. Later he would come to make more songs, which would eventually grow into Finnish classics. In 1950's Disney sued him over the similarity of the main character's name to the Finnish translation of Mickey Mouse, \\"Mikki Hiiri\\". However, Disney abandoned the case after Malmst√©n explained that the characters shared nothing in common but a name, which was also written differently. A fact that might suggest that this explanation is true is the song \\"Mikki-Hiiri ja Susihukka\\" (\\"Mikki-Hiiri and the Wolf\\"), which features an army of Mikki-Hiiris. This leads to the conclusion that the name \\"Mikki-Hiiri\\" was just a name for a race of mouses. However, there is also a rare song made by Malmst√©n which contradicts his explanation.

It was founded in 2004 as a small-scale series of screenings of works-in-progress by Washington DC-area independent documentary filmmakers first at the Warehouse Theater and later at the George Washington University in partnership with The Documentary Center. Its signature program is focused on screening two unfinished documentaries at every workshop. Following each screening, the audience participates in an interactive feedback session with the filmmaker(s). Films have been shown by everyone from students to well- established documentary filmmakers. Workshops are open to the general public so that filmmakers can get feedback from the kind of audiences they are trying to reach.

Established in 1916, the company is best remembered today for its contribution to America's emergency shipbuilding program during World War II. The company was founded in November 1916, by William T. Casey, Otto J. Hoak and Robert Boogs, on a site on the Willamette River just south of the Ross Island Bridge. Little is known about the company's early years, but it appears to have served diverse markets. For example, it placed a bid for the manufacture of 200 fire hydrants for the City of Portland in 1927,Portland Oregon Fire Hydrants, City of Portland Water Bureau Archives. and supplied the high pressure outlet gates for the Unity Dam on the Burnt River near Baker, Oregon in 1937.Burnt River Project - Bureau of Reclamation History Program, Denver, Colorado. The company is recorded as having built only one ship prior to World War II - a small 140-ton tender for the US Coast Guard in 1935. The CIW built the 25-ton tugboat Constance J for the Crown Willamette Paper Company. The Constance J was still in service as an active workboat as late as 2017 under the name Diane. Commercial Iron Works established a shipyard on the Ross Island site in the early 1940s, which turned out close to 200 small warships during the war, including net layers, minelayers, submarine chasers, and LCI and LCS landing craft. It also outfitted larger ships built at other yards with armaments. Following the war, the shipyard was acquired in 1946 by another local firm, the Zidell Machinery and Supply Company, which was eventually to transform the yard into America's largest shipbreaking operation.

Chasmataspidids are probably related to horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) and/or sea scorpions (Eurypterida), with more recent studies suggest that they form a clade (Dekatriata) with Eurypterida and Arachnida. Chasmataspidids are known sporadically in the fossil record through to the mid-Devonian, with possible evidence suggest that they also present during the late Cambrian. Chasmataspidids are most easily recognised by having an abdomen divided into a short forepart (preabdomen) and a longer hindpart (postabdomen) each comprising 4 and 9 segments respectively. There is some debate about whether they form a natural (i.e. monophyletic) group.  Distribution  Geographic distribution of chasmataspidids. Chasmataspidids survived at least since Ordovician to mid-Devonian in age. As of 2019, most chasmataspidids (with a total of 9 species) are known from the Devonian strata, while the preceding Silurian and Ordovician period each have 3 and 2 species being described. Diploaspis is the only genus of chasmataspidids that unambiguously comprises species from different periods (D. casteri and D. muelleri from Devonian and D. praecursor from silurian). There was also trace fossil compose of resting imprints with Chasmataspis-like outline discovered from late-Cambrian stratum, which might suggest an earlier occurrence of chasmataspidids.  Morphology  Size comparison of Dvulikiaspis menneri Most chasmataspidids are small arthropods with body length did not exceed 3 centimeters, with the ordovician species being exceptionally large, ranging between 10 (Chasmataspis) and 29 centimeters (Hoplitaspis). File:20200919 Chasmataspidida dorsal.pngDorsal morphology of a generalized chasmataspidid. The streamlined body of chasmataspidid compose of a rigid prosoma (head or cephalothorax) and an externally 13-segmented opisthosoma (abdomen). Like eurypterid, dorsal side of the prosoma was covered by a rigid carapace (prosomal dorsal shield) that bore a pair of larger lateral (presumably compound) eyes and a pair of tiny median ocelli. Chasmataspidid readily distinguish from other chelicerates by the subdivision of the 13 opisthosomal segments into a widen, 4-segmented preabdomen and a slender, 9-segmented postabdomen. the tergite (dorsal exoskeleton) of the first opisthosomal/preabdomimal segment retain as a narrow element known as 'microtergite', which is not observable in eurypterid. The posterior three preabdominal segments are well developed, forming a rigid box- like section called 'buckler'. The postabdominal segments are cylindrical and the last segment terminated with a spine/plate-like telson, which is usually relatively short. = Appendages = File:Hoplitaspis hiawathai life restoration.pngReconstruction of Hoplitaspis hiawathai with ventral view (B) showing appendicular structures. File:Eurypterid and chasmataspidid sixth appendage comparison.pngComparison of appendage VI between chasmataspidids (left) and eurypterids (right). Since the appendages of chasmataspidid are rarely preserved in the fossil, most species have only fragile or even no appendicular structures had been described. Based on available materials, the prosoma compose of 6 appendage pairs (appendage I - VI) just like most euchelicerates, which were 1 pair of small chelicerae and 5 pairs of limb-like appendages, although the detail morphology of the former is still unclear. The coxae (basalmost limb segments) of appendage II-VI bore gnathobases. At least the posteriormost appendage pair (appendage VI) of prosoma seems to be differ between families. Appendage of Chasmataspididae known only from 2 disarticulated specimens of appendages which interpreted as appendage VI of Chasmataspis. the appendage bore exopod-like structure on the base and terminated with a chelate (pincer), similar to those of a xiphosuran. On the other hand, Appendage VI modified into a paddle that strikingly resemble to those of an eurypterine (swimming eurypterid) was discovered in some species of Diploaspididae, but the basal diploaspidid Loganamaraspis possibly did not possess this character on Appendage VI. the limb-like appendage II-V of diploaspidids are either featureless or bore rows of spines. Opisthosomal appendages are even rarely being observed and only known from a few diploaspidid materials. they are at least present on the ventral side of preabdomen, each pair originated from one preabdominal segment. the anteriormost appendicular structure of opisthosoma was metastoma, a plate-like structure interpreted as a fused appendage pair of first opisthosomal segment, situated between the gnathobase of prosomal appendage VI. Beyond the metastoma were 3 pairs of plate-like opercula originated from the 3 buckler segments, with the first operculum pair (genital operculum) bore a medially positioned genital appendage that extend until the posterior region of second operculum pair. The metastoma, opercula and genital appendage are shared characters between chasmataspidid and eurypterid, but unlike the fused first and second operculum pair of eurypterid, the two operculum pairs seems to be unfused in chasmataspidid. Possible chasmataspidid trace fossil from cambrian have imprints resembling 6 pairs of opercula. If the interpretation is true, chasmataspidid may had extra 3 pairs of opercula on the first 3 postabdominal segment as well.  Representative genera  =Chasmataspis= Reconstruction of Chasmataspis laurencii. The first chasmataspidid to be discovered was Chasmataspis laurencii, described by the American palaeontologists Kenneth E. Caster and H. K. Brooks in 1956. These Ordovician fossils come from the site of the Douglas Dam in Tennessee, USA. They are the most xiphosuran-like of the known chasmataspidid species, with a horseshoe-shaped carapace. Caster & Brooks raised a new family, Chasmataspididae, to accommodate these specimens. The species was redescribed by Jason Dunlop and colleagues in 2004. =Diploaspis= Reconstruction of Diploaspis casteri. The next species to be discovered were Diploaspis casteri and Heteroaspis novojilovi; both described by the Norwegian palaeontologist Leif St√∏rmer from the early Devonian of Alken an der Mosel in Germany in 1972. A revision by Markus Poschmann and co-workers in 2005 recognised H. novojilovi as a synonym of D. casteri. The two species appear to actually be preservational variants of the same species. Poschmann et al. also described a second species as Diploaspis muelleri. A third species, Diploaspis praecursor (Late Silurian, Bertie Group, New York State), was described by Lamsdell and Briggs in 2017. =Forfarella= Reconstruction of Forfarella mitchelli. Forfarella mitchelli from the early Devonian of the Forfar region in the Midland Valley of Scotland was described by Jason Dunlop and colleagues in 1999; although the fossil had actually been recognised as a chasmataspidid and provisionally labelled as such some years previously by Charles Waterston. Forfarella mitchelli is not very well preserved, but does show the characteristic chasmataspidid body plan. =Achanarraspis= The stratigraphically youngest chasmataspidid is Achanarraspis reedi, described by Lyall Anderson and colleagues in 2000, from the mid-Devonian Achanarras quarry in Caithness, Scotland; a famous fossil fish locality. =Octoberaspis= Reconstruction of Octoberaspis ushakovi Well preserved chasmataspidids were recovered from the early Devonian of October Revolution Island, part of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic. Originally briefly described as eurypterids, they were formally described as Octoberaspis ushakovi by Jason Dunlop in 2002. Octoberaspis is one of the few chasmataspidids with well- documented opisthosomal appendages, reveal some characters previously though to be eurypterid-exclusive were also shared by chasmataspidid as well. =Loganamaraspis= Loganamaraspis dunlopi discovered from a famous Silurian fossil locality near Lesmahagow in Scotland. Described by Erik Tetlie and Simon Braddy in 2003, it was placed in Diploaspididae, but interpreted as being somewhat more intermediate in form between the Chasmataspis and Diploaspidid body plans. = Dvulikiaspis = Reconstruction of Dvulikiaspis menneri Fossils of Dvulikiaspis menneri discovered from the Imangda River of Taymyr Peninsula were originally interpreted as a species of eurypterid genus Stylonurus, and formally described as a new genus of chasmataspidid by David J. Marshall and co-authors in 2014. Dvulikiaspis menneri is one of the few well-preserved chasmataspidid, with distal morphology of appendage II-VI had been revealed. = Hoplitaspis = Reconstruction of Hoplitaspis hiawathai Hoplitaspis hiawathai is the second known species of Ordovician chasmataspidid, discovered from the Big Hill Lagerst√§tte of Michigan in United States, described by James C. Lamsdell and co-authors in 2019. With nearly complete set of appendages being observable, Hoplitaspis hiawathai is the most complete chasmataspidid known at that time. Each of the paddle of Hoplitaspis hiawathai has a claw instead of an intersegmental element like those of other diploaspidids, providing clues on the relationship between the appendage VI of Chasmataspis and diploaspidids. Classification = Phylogenetic position = Chasmataspidids have a controversial phylogenetic position within Chelicerata. The first species to be discovered were thought to be unusual fossil xiphosuran, while later species were often based on specimens initially misidentified as eurypterids. Chasmataspidids had been interpreted as relatives/members of either xiphosurans or eurypterids, or forming a clade (Dekatriata) with eurypterids and arachnids. Some studies even suggest that chasmataspidids may not represent a monophyletic taxon - for example as a paraphyletic grade where the eurypterids arose; or a polyphyletic group with Chasmataspis and diploaspidids more closely related to xiphosuans and eurypterids, respectively. The polyphyletic hypothesis was based on the xiphosuran-like characters of Chasmataspis (e.g. genal spines, chelate limbs, fused opisthosomal segments) and eurypterid-like characters found on diploaspidid genera (e.g. paddles on appendage VI). However this interpretation could be unreliable, as the characters are either partially shared by both xiphosuans and eurypterids (e.g. genal spines were be found in eurypterid juveniles; some xiphosurans have non-chelate limbs and unfused opisthosoma) or more likely represent a result of parallel evolution (e.g. the paddles of diploaspidids and swimming eurypterids have different component). Additionally, the monophyly of chasmataspidids could be supported by the unique component of 4-segmented preabdomen and 9-segmented postabdomen as well. As of 2010s, many studies supports the monophyly of Chasmataspidida and Dekatriata (Chasmataspidida+Eurypterida+Arachnida). = Interrelationships = As of 2019, up to 12 genera had been associated within Chasmataspidida. With the exception of Diploaspis which compose of 3 species since 2017, all chasmataspidid genera are monotypic. The order Chasmataspidida subdivided into two families: Chasmataspididae and Diploaspididae. the former comprise of Chasmataspis (and possibly also Kiaeria) while the latter include the remaining genera.Dunlop, J.

The commemoration falls in Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. Many of the events associated with the ritual take place in congregation halls known as Hussainia. The event marks the anniversary of the Battle of Karbala (AD 680/AH 61), when Imam Hussein ibn Ali, a grandson of Prophet Muhammad, was martyred by the forces of the second Umayyad caliph. Family members and companions accompanying him were either killed or subjected to humiliation. The commemoration of this event during the yearly mourning season, with the Day of Ashura as the focal date, serves to define Shia communal identity. Muharram observances are carried out in countries with a sizable Shia population. Shia Muslims mourn during Muharram, although Sunnis do so to a much lesser extent. Storytelling, weeping and chest beating, wearing black, partial fasting, street processions, and re-enactments of the Battle of Karbala form the crux of the observances. Self-flagellation has been practiced but is now considered haram (prohibited) by most Usuli Shia authorities (maraji).  Etymology  The words Azadari (Persian: ÿπÿ≤ÿßÿØÿßÿ±€å) or Sogvari (ÿ≥Ÿà⁄ØŸàÿßÿ±€å) which mean mourning and lamentation; and Majalis-e Aza have been exclusively used in connection with the remembrance ceremonies for the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (A.S). Majalis-e Aza, also known as Aza-e Husayn, includes mourning congregations, lamentations, matam and all such actions which express the emotions of grief and above all, repulsion against what Yazid I stood for. Expression of grief with thumping of the chest by Shia Muslims is known as Latmya, Latmaya or latmia in Arabic-Persian countries. In India and Pakistan it is called Matam or Matam-Dari/Sina Zannee (chest beating). Muharram rituals was often called by European observers \\"the Feast of Hasan and Hosayn,\\" as the participants shout \\"Hasan! Hosayn!\\" The term majalis has both a grammatical meaning and a meaning which relates to Aza-e- Husayn. In its technical sense, a majalis is a meeting, a session or a gathering.  Background  According to Shia sources, the mourning of Muharram was started by the family, especially women, of Muhammad (the Ahl-ul- Bayt) immediately after the death of his grandson and even before entering Damascus. Following the battle of Karbala, Muhammad's granddaughter Zaynab bint Ali and sister of Imam Husayn, began mourning for the fallen and making speeches against Imam Husayn ibn Ali's opponents: Ibn Ziyad and Yazid I. News of Imam Husayn ibn Ali's martyrdom was spread by Imam Zain-ul-Abideen, who succeeded Imam Husayn as the Shia Imam, via sermons and speeches throughout Iraq, Syria and Hejaz. According to the History of the Prophets and Kings, when Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin gave the sermon in presence of Yazid, he let them hold the mourning of Husain ibn Ali for three days in a formal manner. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the mourning of Husain ibn Ali‚Äôs Killing was performed furtively in the homes of Shia Imam and their followers, but during the Abbasid Caliphate this mourning was observed in public mosques by the Abbasid rulers to draw a people‚Äôs attention . During the Fatimid Caliphate, Imam Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (d. 365/975), the 14th Ismaili imam, instructed Syedna Al-Qadi al-Nu'man to proclaim in his Friday sermon the significance of  øAashura and elucidate the manner in which it should be commemorated.. Al-Maqrizi (d. 845/1442), a medieval Egyptian historian, notes that in the Fatimi empire the Day of  øAashura was marked as a day of grief and markets were shut.. During Imam Al-Mustansir Billah's (d. 427/1094) era, the 18th Ismaili Imam, audiences were encouraged to explicitly express sorrow and tears on the occasion of  øAashura as written in the majalis authored by Syedna Al-Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi (470/1078). The 20th Musta'li Isma'ili Imam, Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah (526/1132), presided over a congregation on the Day of  øAashura seated on an un-cushioned chair made of palm branches. The Imam AS wore a veil that day, and the reporter, Ibn al-Ma‚Äômun, writes that sorrow and grief were clearly visible in his countenance. Ibn al-Tuwayr records that on the Day of  øAashura, the royal carpets in the palace would be replaced with straw mats. 10th of the month of Muharrem in the Ottoman Empire As Chelkowski said, in fourth century in Baghdad, contemporaneous with the reigns of Sulton Muizz ad-Dawla of the Shia Buyid dynasty, the first public mourning ritual happened, and the market was closed by order of him on day of Ashura. The mourning rituals evolved differently in different places, until the Safavid dynasty established a centralized Shia state in the 16th century: The annual mourning ceremonies and ritual cursing of Husayn's enemies acquired the status of a national institution. According to popular belief, Shia rituals spread to South Asia starting at the end of the 14th Century with the conquests of Tamerlane. Observance has since spread to countries such as India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Yemen, Bahrain, Azerbaijan and Lebanon. Types Nawab of Oudh listening at night to the maulvi reading from the scriptures during Muharram, c. 1795. The type of mourning of Muharram varies between branches of Shia, Sunni, and different ethnic groups. =Shia= Shia Muslims around the world every year commemorate the mourning custom of death of Husayn ibn Ali, his family and his follower in months of Muharram and Safar. They entitle him \\"Prince of Martyrs\\" and know him as a spiritual and political savior. He still has an important role in the religious and national consciousness of the people. According to the Shia belief, taking part in the mourning ritual will be a help to salvation on the Day of Judgment, as Elias Canetti (winner of Nobel Prize) said ‚Äú[it] became the very core of the Shiite faith ... of all the traditional religions of lament which could be adduced for closer consideration ‚Äì that of the Islamic is the most illuminating... The lament itself, as an impassioned pack opening out, to a true crowd, manifests itself with unforgettable power at the Muharram Festival Shiites‚Äù. At first the mourning ceremonies and custom have been done in the open air at the main thoroughfare of city of village, a major intersection in the bazaar, the yard of the mosque, caravanserai and private homes. After a while, in order to protect mourners from weather, the Hussainiya and the Tekyeh were built. =Sunni= The event is observed by many Sunnis, but to a lesser extent, and as a time of remembrance, rather than mourning. There is mourning among Ahl-e- Sunnat wal Jamaa'ah, as well as they remember Ahl-e-Bayt, and in particular Imaam Hussein, as well as the Sahaabahs, through talks across masjids (mosques) during the first 10 days of Muharram-ul-Haraam. =Custom= After almost 12 centuries, five types of major rituals were developed around the battle of Karbala. These rituals include the memorial services (majalis al- ta'ziya), the visitation of Husayn's tomb in Karbala particularly on the occasion of the tenth day of Ashura and the fortieth day after the battle (Ziyarat Ashura and ziyarat al-Arba'in), the public mourning processions (al- mawakib al-husayniyya or the representation of the battle of Karbala in the form of a play (the shabih), and the flagellation (tatbir). Pilgrimage to the shrine of Husayn Imam Husayn Shrine is located at the mosque and burial site of Husayn ibn Ali, the third Shia Imam in the city of Karbala, Iraq. Many Shia go on a pilgrimage to the shrine in Karbala, one of the holiest places for Shias apart from Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Up to one million pilgrims visit the city annually to observe the anniversary of Imam Husayn ibn Ali's death. Shia Muslims believe that pilgrimage to Husayn ibn Ali‚Äôs shrine, like weeping, wipes out their sins to a great extent. Matam Shi'a Muslims in Bahrain strike their chests during the Remembrance of Muharram. The Arabic term matam refers in general to an act or gesture of mourning; in Shia Islam the term designates acts of lamentation for the martyrs of Karbala.Shƒ´ ªite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions By Lynda Clarke, Global Academic Publishing, 01-Jun-2001 Male and female participants congregate in public for ceremonial chest beating (matam- ÿ≥€åŸÜ€Å ÿ≤ŸÜ€å) as a display of their devotion to Imam Husayn and in remembrance of his suffering.Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity among the Daudi Bohras By Jonah Blank, University of Chicago Press, 15-Apr-2001 In some Shi'a societies, such as those in Bahrain, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Bangladesh and Iraq, male participants may incorporate knives or razors swung upon chains into their matam. There are two basic forms of matam:Reliving Karbala: Martyrdom in South Asian Memory By Syed Akbar Hyder, Oxford University Press, 01-Sep-2008Sharing the Sacred: Practicing Pluralism in Muslim North India By Anna Bigelow, Oxford University Press, 28-Jan-2010 * matam using one's hands only, that is, sineh-zani or chest-beating * matam with implements like chains, knives, swords and blades, that is, zanjeer- zani(ÿ≤ŸÜÿ¨€åÿ± ÿ≤ŸÜ€å), qama-zani (ŸÇŸÖÿπ ÿ≤ŸÜ€å), etc. Matam in South Asia is the most significant and sensitive Shia identity marker, although the act is also condemned by many Shi'a religious leaders. Tatbir Taziya Ta'ziya procession on Ashura in Barabanki, India (January 2009) One form of mourning is the theatrical re-enactment of the Battle of Karbala. In Iran this is called taziya or taziyeh. Theatrical groups that specialize in taziya are called taziya groups.Chelkowski, Peter (ed.) (1979) Ta ªziyeh, ritual and drama in Iran New York University Press, New York, Taziyas were popular through the Qajar dynasty until the early twentieth century, but the re-enactments slowly declined until they were mostly abandoned in the large cities by the early 1940s. Nonetheless, taziyas continued to exist in Iran on a smaller scale especially in more rural and traditional areas. Reza Shah, the first of the Pahlavi dynasty, had outlawed taziyas. Despite attempts since 1979, Muharram processions and various forms of the rawza khani are still more common.Martin, Richard C. (ed.) (2004) \\"Taziya\\" Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World Macmillan Reference USA, New York, p. 691 Noha By increasing the number of shia Muslim in cities and states, mourning of muharram‚Äôs ritual changed to a more elaborate form. In the ninth century, lamentation and wailing became propounded as a mourning tradition. Noha is the poem and story that be inspired from Maqtal al-Husayn (various books which narrate the story of the battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn ibn Ali) . The poet or another one read the noha with plaintive rhythm. The main subject of noha is the pain from the killing of Husayn ibn Ali. Noha consists of poems in different languages such as Arabic, Urdu, Farsi,Saraeki, Sindhi and Punjabi. Weeping The reaction of the audience in the reenactment of the Battle of Karbala‚Äô episode is significant for the strengthening of distinct Shia identity and the weeping over the killing of Husayn ibn Ali and his follower is one of these reactions. There is close relation between the lamentation and weeping. According to the narration, Shia Imams had emphasized to weep for them, so it had transmitted to future generation. According to Shia tradition, the weeping and the flow of tears provides condolences to Imam Husayn's mother and his family, as the living relatives (mostly women and children) were not allowed to weep or lament over their martyred family which involved Imam Husayn's, his family (including his two sons, a six-month-old baby martyred by an arrow/spear to his neck and another 18 year who took a spear to his heart) and his companions. Lamenting and weeping for the (mazloom) wronged and offering condolences to his family, thus, will serve as one of the good deeds done by the mourners of Husayn (azadaar e Husayn) and will be helpful in saving them from being condemned to hell fire on the day of judgment.  Processions  Depending on the condition of society, the Muharram processions changes from one city to another. The common form is the starting of mourning processions from Hussainiya and the participants would parade through the streets of their town or village, finally they come back to Hussainiya for performing other mourning of Muharram‚Äôs ritual. The procession was common ritual‚Äôs mourning of dead persons in Arabic states before the appearance of Islam. The chest-beating, flagellation and face-slapping (latm) are usual acts doing during the mourning procession, but chest-beating and face-slapping (latm) have more precedence and the history of doing this acts had been reached to Buyid dynasty period. Chest beating  Iranian men performing chest-beating during Muharram Chest beating () refer to common rituals practiced in mourning ceremonies of Shia Imams. In the nineteenth century, the Iranian practiced chest-beating introduced by Indian Syed Dildar Ali Nasirabadi and the chest-beating was attributed to the concept of Zuljinah (the horse with two wings) processions. The chest beating is allowed just in calamities belong to the family of Muhammad. At the Isfahanis‚Äô mosque, mourners just gather into the middle of the courtyard bared their upper torsos Ÿán the form of a procession and began randomly beating their chests to the melodic suggestions. Flagellation Acts of flagellation are a symbolic reenacting of the blood-shedding of Husayn ibn Ali. The previous record of this dramatic act reaches back to the seventeenth century practice in the Caucasus and in Azerbaijan, and was observed in the nineteenth century by the Shia Twelvers in central and southern cities of Iran and the Arab world. There were various types of flagellation including striking of chests with the palms, striking of backs with chains, and cutting foreheads with knives or swords. In 1993, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, leader of Iran issued a fatwa calling flagellation wrong, fake and false. He later argued that while the communist regime of USSR closed or changed many mosques and banned many other Islamic practices in Azerbaijan, they allowed flagellation. While the fatwa is not obligatory to followers of other Maraji, official stance of Iranian government is that of the leader, so that flagellation is not openly practiced in Iran anymore. Rawda Rawda is one of the Shia Iranian mourning rituals to commemorate the death of Husayn ibn Ali and his followers ‚Äì especially it is the kind of public lamentation. Rawda means garden in Arabic language and this name is acquired from the title of Rawdat al-Shuhada, literary masterpiece book authored by Husayn Waiz Kashifi in Persian. The word of Rawda-khawani means \\"recitation from Rawdat alshuhada\\" and generally is named Rawda. At first this ritual became customary on first ten days of Muharram, but by passing of time it was performed during Muharam and Safar and other days of year. Today, Rawda is either the story of Rawdat of al-Shuhada or stories that Raw·∏ça-kÃ≤hÃ≤ w ƒÅn (person who does the recitation) creates by his skills and knowledge to release the original text of the book. This ritual can be held at every where such as houses, the yard of mosque, the square of city or village and also Hussainiya and the Tekyeh. The origin place of Rawda was Iran, but then at Bahrain this ritual is seen in its original form and at other place like India, the modified form of it is held. Alam One of the most important and symbolic objects used at mourning rituals is the Alam. It is the ensign of Husayn ibn Ali in the Battle of Karbala and a sign of truth and bravery. During the battle of Karbala, the original standard-bearer of Husayn ibn Ali's kafala (caravan) was Abbas, Husayn's brother. Abbas lost his life in battle when he went to retrieve water from the Euphrates River for the caravan's young children who were thirsty for three days. It is narrated that when he started to ride back to the camp with the water, he was surprise- attacked. While in battle, the children of the camp were anxiously watching the alam (Arabic and Persian  øalam, pl. a ølƒÅm, 'standard' or 'banner') dip up and down from afar. Abbas lost both of his arms in battle yet he still continued to clench the water skin (mushk) with his teeth, determined to bring the water back to the children. The leader of the opposition saw Abbas gaining ground and ordered for more army men to attack the flag bearer, stating, \\"If water is brought back to their tent, there is no stopping them.\\" Archers then started bombarding Abbas with arrows which pierced the water skin, bringing him down from his horse with the alam falling to the ground. Alams are a reminder of Abbas' martyrdom, and act as a symbol of affection and salutation towards the followers of Husayn ibn Ali who lost their lives in Karbala. Alams all vary in size but usually consist of a wood pole base, with a metal finial and cross-bar that is fixated at the top of the pole. The pole is then dressed with cloth and a banner with the names of Muhammad's family members. Alams with Abbas' name usually include an ornament that resembles the water skin that he intended to fill for the children. The length of an Alam can be about 15 feet. An Alam consists of flexible steel plates placed at the upper part of it. Also, an Alam is decorated by plumes and fine embroidered silks and brocades. Nakhl Gardani Nakhl Gardani (, ) is a religious ritual carried out on the day of Ashura for commemorating the death of Husayn ibn Ali's death. Nakhl is a wooden (lit. date-palm) structure used as a symbolic representation of the Imam's coffin, and nakhl-gardani is the act of carrying the nakhl in procession, resembling Imam's funeral. By country = Indian Subcontinent = Hyderabad photographed by Lala Deen Dayal, c. 1880s. In South Asia, literary and musical genres produced by both Shias and Sunnis, that have been inspired by the Battle of Karbala are performed during the month, such as marsiya, noha and soaz. This is meant to increase the people's understanding of how the enemies fought The Battle of Karbala against Imam Husayn and his followers. In Hyderabad, the Bibi-Ka-Alam procession is taken annually to mark the date. = Caribbean = In Trinidad and Tobago and JamaicaShankar, Guha (2003) Imagining India(ns): Cultural Performances and Diaspora Politics in Jamaica.

The DTFE has various astrophysical applications, such as the analysis of numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation, the mapping of the large-scale structure of the universe and improving computer simulation programs of cosmic structure formation. It has been developed by Willem Schaap and Rien van de Weijgaert. The main advantage of the DTFE is that it automatically adapts to (strong) variations in density and geometry. It is therefore very well suited for studies of the large scale galaxy distribution.  Method  The DTFE consists of three main steps: Overview of the DTFE procedure. = Step 1 = The starting point is a given discrete point distribution. In the upper left-hand frame of the figure, a point distribution is plotted in which at the center of the frame an object is located whose density diminishes radially outwards. In the first step of the DTFE, the Delaunay tessellation of the point distribution is constructed. This is a volume-covering division of space into triangles (tetrahedra in three dimensions), whose vertices are formed by the point distribution (see figure, upper right-hand frame). The Delaunay tessellation is defined such that inside the interior of the circumcircle of each Delaunay triangle no other points from the defining point distribution are present. = Step 2 = The Delaunay tessellation forms the heart of the DTFE. In the figure it is clearly visible that the tessellation automatically adapts to both the local density and geometry of the point distribution: where the density is high, the triangles are small and vice versa. The size of the triangles is therefore a measure of the local density of the point distribution. This property of the Delaunay tessellation is exploited in step 2 of the DTFE, in which the local density is estimated at the locations of the sampling points. For this purpose the density is defined at the location of each sampling point as the inverse of the area of its surrounding Delaunay triangles (times a normalization constant, see figure, lower right-hand frame). = Step 3 = In step 3 these density estimates are interpolated to any other point, by assuming that inside each Delaunay triangle the density field varies linearly (see figure, lower left-hand frame).  Applications  = An atlas of the nearby universe = One of the main applications of the DTFE is the rendering of our cosmic neighborhood. Below the DTFE reconstruction of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey is shown, revealing an impressive view on the cosmic structures in the nearby universe. Several superclusters stand out, such as the Sloan Great Wall, one of the largest structures in the universe. Image:2dfgrs.pngThe 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey Image:2dfdtfe.gifDTFE reconstruction of the inner parts of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey = Numerical simulations of structure formation = Most algorithms for simulating cosmic structure formation are particle hydrodynamics codes. At the core of these codes is the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) density estimation procedure. Replacing it by the DTFE density estimate will yield a major improvement for simulations incorporating feedback processes, which play a major role in galaxy and star formation. = Cosmic velocity field = DTFE velocity field reconstructions of superclusters and voids in the large scale galaxy distribution. The DTFE has been designed for reconstructing density or intensity fields from a discrete set of irregularly distributed points sampling this field. However, it can also be used to reconstruct other continuous fields which have been sampled at the locations of these points, for example the cosmic velocity field. The use of the DTFE for this purpose has the same advantages as it has for reconstructing density fields. The fields are reconstructed locally without the application of an artificial or user-dependent smoothing procedure, resulting in an optimal resolution and the suppression of shot noise effects. The estimated quantities are volume-covering and allow for a direct comparison with theoretical predictions. = Evolution and dynamics of the cosmic web = The DTFE has been specifically designed for describing the complex properties of the cosmic web. It can therefore be used to study the evolution of voids and superclusters in the large scale matter galaxy distribution.

The first Revival took place 50 years after the 9th Duke of Richmond and Gordon opened the motor racing track in 1948, driving around the circuit in a Bristol 400, then Britain's state-of-the-art sporting saloon. Most people dress in period clothes. It is one of the world's most popular motor race meetings and the only United Kingdom event which recreates the 1950s and 1960s era of motorsport. There was some opposition to the re- introduction of racing at the circuit, but a numerically strong lobby in the form of the Goodwood Supporters Association helped eventually to gain approval. p.4 The festival is a showcase for wheel-to-wheel racing around a classic circuit, untouched by more modern developments, and relives the glory days of Goodwood Circuit, which ranked alongside Silverstone as Britain's leading racing venue throughout its active years. Between 1948 and 1966 Goodwood hosted contemporary racing of all kinds, including Formula One, the Goodwood Nine Hours race, and the Tourist Trophy sports car race. Ferrari paddock, 2004 The festival includes Grand Prix cars from the 1950s and 1960s, sports and GT cars, as well as historic saloon cars and little-seen Formula Juniors.

Early years and World War I Herren was born in Dadeville, Alabama, on August 9, 1895. He was graduated from Tallapoosa Country High School in 1914 and from the University of Alabama in 1917. After a few months as a high school teacher in Gadsden, Alabama, he enrolled as an officer candidate in the first officers training camp at Fort McPherson, Georgia in May 1917. He was commissioned a provisional second lieutenant in the Regular Army on August 15, 1917 and assigned to the 78th Field Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas. After a brief course at the Field Artillery School, he accompanied his regiment to France as a battery executive officer and then commander until it was demobilized. Inter-war years After World War I, Herren was troop commander (Troop A) in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, and then a recruiting officer in Springfield, Massachusetts. His area included all of New England within the First Corps Area, headquartered in Boston. Herren attended the Troop Officer Course at the United States Army Cavalry School in 1926‚Äì27. After graduation he returned to Fort Bliss, assigned to the 8th Cavalry Regiment, serving as a troop commander and regimental adjutant. Additionally, he was captain of the horse show team and a noted member of the post's pre-war polo team. He participated in maneuvers in the Big Bend area of Texas, trained remounts and cavalry recruits and assisted in the care and feeding of thousands of Mexicans whose homes has been inundated in the 1927 flood of the Rio Grande. It was while serving here that he met and married his wife, Lillian Hague Corcoran, the daughter of a cavalry officer. From 1930 to 1935 Herren was assigned to the 6th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, again as a troop commander (Troop F) and regimental adjutant. He continued his participation in this regiment's horse show team (as its captain) and polo team. He participated with his troop in annual maneuvers with the United States Army Infantry School students at Fort Benning, Georgia. Civilian Conservation Corps In 1933, during the Great Depression, the United States Army provided logistical support to the federal Emergency Conservation Work program, later known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Herren, as part of that effort, moved to Gatlinburg, Tennessee where he organized and supervised the construction, supply and operation of 17 CCC camps in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At the Smokies, local citizens or \\"local experienced men\\" (LEM) were employed to cut the dead chestnut timber and snake it clown the mountains, saw it into lumber and construct the camps for young male enrollees from urban areas. After the camps were built and occupied, he returned to Fort Oglethorpe to become CCC district supervisor for Tennessee and North Carolina. During this period he attended short courses in Chemical Warfare, Sanitation, Food Service, Public Relations and other subjects of value to military officers. His sons, Thomas W Herren Jr., and John D. Herren, were born during his tour at Fort Oglethorpe and would both later go on to graduate from the United States Military Academy. Advanced Officer Training In 1935, Herren was promoted to major and attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Upon the completion of that course in 1936, he returned to the United States Army Cavalry School, at Fort Riley, Kansas as an instructor in the Department of Tactics from 1937 to 1938. At that time \\"Mechanization\\" was introduced into the school curriculum and the tactics and techniques developed by Herren's department were later used by General George Patton and his armored units in World War II. During the summer of 1938 Herren was assigned to the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia where he was a cavalry instructor and chairman of the animal management and transportation committee. At the school, he was responsible for all activities involving the use of horses and reconnaissance vehicles, developing and demonstrating tactics of scout cars and light reconnaissance vehicles of all types. He worked with infantry instructors to develop the use of light tanks, armored cars and other mechanized equipment. The use of anti- tank battalions was first introduced at this time. The Infantry School had a stable of horses used for tactical rides and mobility in heavy terrain and its horse show team and polo teams provided recreation for students and members of the regular garrison. World War II In 1942 Herren was promoted to colonel and assigned to the 106th Cavalry Regiment of the Illinois National Guard then in training at Camp Livingston, Louisiana. This regiment was one of the first to receive mechanized equipment and was being prepared for overseas duty in a crash program. Every individual had to the retrained, new subjects taught and tactics and techniques developed and perfected. As commander, he prepared this regiment for combat by intensive training which included two of the famous Louisiana Maneuvers. As the regiment was deployed to Europe in 1943, Herren returned to the Cavalry School at Fort Riley as its commandant and was promoted to brigadier general in 1944. Herren joined the 70th Infanrt Division at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri as assistant division commander in the fall of 1944, near the end of its pre-deployment training.

The Army, as the senior service, is the lead participant in public ceremonies and other events that occur continuously in the Washington, D.C. area. During the Korean War, Herren was deputy commanding general for Eighth United States Army. Then as an effort to focus Eighth Army efforts on combat, Herren was appointed commanding general of the Korean Communications Zone and Economic Adviser, Republic of Korea, a vital rear echelon command responsible for U.S. Army activities in the southern two thirds of South Korea. He oversaw the handling of prisoners of war, refugees and logistical support and supply of combat units of Eighth Army. He received the repatriated U.S. prisoners of war and facilitated their return to the United States. Conversely, his responsibilities included the detention and later, the return of Communist prisoners of war to North Korea. In 1953 Herren became commanding general of a newly established Northern Area Command of United States Army Europe headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany.

After the end of his military career, Herren moved to Washington, D.C. working in the private sector until 1967. Herren maintained close ties with his family and friends in and around Birmingham, Alabama and enjoyed vacations at his lake cabin on Lake Martin near his hometown of Dadeville, Alabama.

The analogue networks continued its broadcasts alongside the digital ones until September 1, 2007, when they were shut down nationwide. Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplexes: MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster Yleisradio and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: MTV3 and Nelonen. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched. All Yles channels are broadcast free-to-air, so are a few commercial ones including MTV3, Nelonen, Sub, Jim, Nelonen Pro 2 and Kutonen. There are also several pay channels. These are sold only by PlusTV. History The official launch took place on August 21, 2001. Under the original plans the channel's available would be, other than the four analogue ones: Yle's news channel (YLE24), Yle's cultural and educational channel (YLE Teema), Yle's Swedish channel (FST), a regional station (CityTV), a sports channel (Urheilukanava), a film channel from Helsinki Media (Elokuvakanava), a \\"school channel\\" from WSOY (Alfa+), a lifestyle channel (Wellnet) and Canal+. The Yle's channels, MTV3, Nelonen and Urheilukanava (later renamed Nelonen Sport) were on board from the start. WSOY eventually decided to withdraw from the project without launching their channel, as did Canal+ and Elokuvakanava. CityTV eventually turned into the entertainment channel SubTV. In 2003, MTV Oy started en \\"extra\\" channels, MTV3+, which offered some extra sports content. Nelonen also had an extra channel called Nelonen Plus. TV Viisi started in March 2004. Canal Digital launched pay television with three Canal+ channels in March 2004. A fourth Canal+ channel, Canal+ Sport was added in November. The Disney Channel was added in April 2006 and KinoTV, Eurosport, Discovery, MTV and Nickelodeon in September 2007. In September 2008 the rival operator PlusTV got exclusive rights to all, but CANAL+ channels and Canal Digital was left with them only. The last move in Canal Digital's antenna operations in Finland took place on September 16, 2009, when PlusTV got exclusive rights to CANAL+ channels too. Nowadays Canal Digital operates only via satellite. PlusTV was launched in November 2006, originally only broadcasting MTV3 Max and Subtv Juniori. They added Subtv Leffa in April and Urheilu+kanava in June 2007. Both packages got more channels with the launch of MUX E in September 2007: SVT Europa and MTV3 Fakta was added to PlusTV and KinoTV was added to Canal Digital, while Discovery Channel, Eurosport, MTV Finland and Nickelodeon were added to both packages. September 2007 also saw the launch of the SveaTV package in Ostrobothnia which broadcasts Swedish language channels from a special multiplex. On the digital platform, subtitling isn't a part of the video stream, but is delivered as a separate data stream, which allows subtitling in multiple languages and the option to remove subtitles. Due to technical problems with the subtitles, many people cancelled their television licenses. This meant that Yle had to make drastic budget cuts. The digital channel YLE Extra was closed on December 31, 2007 and was replaced by YLE TV1+, a simulcast of TV1 with subtitles included in the video stream. TV1+ was replaced by SVT Europa in September 2008.SVT Europa i hela Finland , Vasabladet, December 20, 2007 PlusTV took over Canal Digital's basic channel package ParempiTV on October 1, 2008.

Some of the Thames' most expensive houseboats are on this stretch of the river, known as the Thames Riviera,Transport for London ‚Äì The Thames Riviera and are arranged over up to three storeys.Quirky Homes article from Money at MSN September 2012, retrieved 2012-11-20 History The island's previous names include Walnut Tree Ait and Kent's AitOrdnance Survey six-inch map series 1888‚Äì1913 http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=15‚™´=51.4111&lon;=-0.3615&layers;=6&b;=1 and it was a site for the growing of osiers used for basket making. Its official name comes from the boat builder Thomas Tagg, who hired out boats on the island from 1841. In 1872 he built the Thames Hotel on the island. It became a venue frequented by London's high society including Edward, Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. In 1912 the impresario Fred Karno, who discovered Charlie Chaplin, purchased the island and rebuilt the hotel. He employed the noted theatre architect Frank Matcham to include a music hall called The Karsino. The island became a popular resort which included, in addition to the hotel and music hall, a boathouse and various seasonal attractions. Karno, who had a luxury houseboat permanently moored at the island, described the resort modestly as \\"the hub of the universe for river people\\". However, the economic downturn caused by the First World War meant that the island's fortunes waned. The hotel was renamed The Casino but its popularity did not return and Karno sold it in 1926. It was reopened two years later as the Thames Riviera and a vehicle ferry was established to transport cars to the island. In 1940 it closed again, and after a chequered history of attempts to revive or repurpose it that involved many financial collapses, the building was demolished in 1971 and never rebuilt. During the mid-1960s, the Casino briefly hosted the Crawdaddy Club, which featured bands such as Chris Farlowe & The Thunderbirds, The Shotgun Express and Pink Floyd. The Astoria houseboat, built by Fred Karno and owned by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, is visible from the island on the northern bank upstream. Tagg's Island was eventually acquired by the houseboat residents who transformed the island into a houseboat community. Sundial The sundial in St Albans Riverside; near the island.

The site is located on the top of the Seuti river bank, to small distance east of the Dantakali Temple. It is taken as an important place for religious people. Within the temple, two earthen piles have been raised which have the tradition of worshiping as the Budha Subba. The place has uniquely tip-less bamboo plants. The tips of these bamboos are believed to be broken by shots of slingshot used by Budha subba.Regarded by many as one of the , if not \\"The Most important cultural site of Eastern Nepal.\\" The temple is crowded by people in Saturdays. Generally at Saturdays, sacrifices of rooster and pigs are made. The temple is systematically handled since 2015 BS (1958-59 CE). Historian Iman Singh Chemjong Limbu says Bijaypur was the capital of the Limbuwan (Pallo Kirat) kingdom during and after the reign of King Bijaynarayan Raya Khebang. Location Budha Subba Temple is located in Dharan about 136 mi (or 220 km) east of country's capital city. The site is located on the top of the seuti river bank, to small distance east of the Dantakali temple.  Origin  = Myth = According to myth, a Subba hunter Budha Subba and his sister used to play and hunt on the hill with a slingshot. By hitting the tips of a bamboo tree while hunting crow, the tip of the bamboo tree was lost and never grew back. After the miss, Subba gave up hunting, buried his slingshot and started meditation. It is the same spot where the temple stands today and the small mound of mud is believed to be the spot where he meditated. According to this legend, the temple got its name from the hunter. His sister has a temple by its side. Interestingly even today, the bamboo trees in Bijaypur hill do not have a tips and not a single crow could be found in the area, despite the occasional picnickers and the offerings in the temple. = HISTORY = According to the History it is the tomb of the last Limbu King (Rai) of Morang (a district of Nepal), Budhhi Karna Khebang, whose rule of Bijaypur began after the murder of Kamdutta Sen in 1762 AD and ended with Gurkhali King Prithvi Narayan Shah‚Äòs invasion in 1773 AD. Bijaypur was the capital city of the Morang and the political and economic center of east Limbuwan. He was tricked into coming to Bijaypur-Dharan for a negotiation, then killed by the assassins of King Prithvi Narayan Shah of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1773. Budhhi Karna Khebang's soul is believed to have wandered around the area of his tomb around Bijaypur and was said to be a friendly and helpful spirit. Then local Limbu people started worshiping the soul as an old king ( Haang means King in Limbu language) believing it to bring good luck. In Limbu language Hang means ‚ÄòKing‚Äô(Raja). = Lord Shiva/ Parvati = Some say Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati under the guise of Theba Sammang and Yuma Sammang, Yakthung King and Queen in the process of hunting arrived at Vijaypur where they stuck their bows and sat in a penance. During then, they realized the approach of Kaliyuga and immediately disappeared. That event is called Budha subba in Yakthung language. From the bows sprouted bamboo shoots without the tuft. = Eklavya = Another myth mentions the event of Ekalavya in deep meditation and self training of archery by setting up an image of Guru Dronacharya, famous teacher of Kauravas and Pandavas. It says Ekalavya himself is Budha subba. Worship and meditation at this place are believed to fulfill one's wishes.  Bamboo writings and threads  In the vicinity of the temple, initially there was a trend of writing on the bamboo tree. The young men who came to visit the temple would return only by writing a name on bamboo as it is believed that writing the name of lovers will give success in their love. But, the temple committee has stopped the name writings on the bamboo as the name writings of the bamboo hampered the growth of the bamboo with the increase in bamboo writings. Nowadays, lovers tie sacred threads to the bamboo after worshiping Budha subba. _Translation:_ will go to budha subba to write on bamboo trees today! how long should I stay thinking that you will come...

In 1978 he recorded the debut album Stateless with the Lene Lovich band, from which came the top-three UK single \\"Lucky Number\\". He then toured with the Lene Lovich band on the Stiff Records \\"Be Stiff Route 78 Tour\\" of the UK and New York. From 1978 to 1981, Fran√ßois worked with ex- Strutters Mark Kjeldsen and Bobbi (Irwin) Trehern, on a project they named The Sinceros. They went on to make two albums for Epic Records, The Sound Of Sunbathing and Pet Rock, and achieved moderate success before they disbanded in 1981. Fran√ßois continued playing sessions while remaining with Epic Records, releasing a solo single \\"If You Love Me\\", before joining The Teardrop Explodes for their Wilder album tour, which took in the UK, Europe, Australia and the US. He also features on the 1984 Julian Cope solo album World Shut Your Mouth. In 1984, Fran√ßois played bass guitar on the album This Island with Eurogliders. Produced by Nigel Gray in his Oxfordshire studio, the album included the top ten single \\"Heaven (Must Be There)\\". Fran√ßois left the UK to live and work in Australia. He played bass and synthesizer on the Eurogliders next LP, Absolutely. The album was in the charts for 47 weeks and spawned three Australian top ten singles, including \\"The City of Soul\\" which featured Fran√ßois' trademark funky bass techniques. Parting company with Eurogliders in 1987, Fran√ßois formed the power pop trio Panic Poets, who released the independent single \\"Let's Go\\" in Australia in 1988, gaining good airplay. In recent years, Fran√ßois has collaborated on several albums with West Australian percussionist Murray Campbell, as part of Campbell's \\"Beatworld\\" project. Now living in New South Wales, Fran√ßois is still very much involved in songwriting and production with local artists at his recording studio (Point Studio) on the Central Coast.

The fabric is not documented prior to the 19th century, though similar textiles existed in the Middle East in earlier times. Other spellings include assuite, asyut, assyut, asyute, and azute. The name translates roughly as \\"net with metal\\". Properties Assuit has great lateral elasticity, thanks to its openwork mesh. It is heavy, and retains heat, but is favoured for its ability to drape. Production The base material is bobbinet, which is a machine- made fabric made of cotton or, in older pieces, linen. The embroidery is applied by hand. Thin strips of alloy are threaded onto a flat, wide needle with a flat, wide eye. Alloy is used because pure silver would blacken with age and would be impossible to clean, and gold would be too costly. Each strip is approximately 1/8\\" wide and 18\\" to 24\\" long. The strips are threaded into the mesh, criss-crossed, flattened with the fingernails, and cut. The fabric is then stamped down, and when the designs are finished, the fabric is passed through a roller to flatten the metal even more. History Historically, metal thread embroidery has been used extensively throughout the Middle East, Asia, and parts of Europe. References are made to its use with Egyptian linen in the Bible. Also, 3,000‚Äëyear‚Äëold specimens of netting made with flax are preserved in the Museum of Montbijou, Berlin. The hand-made net is of intricate design; each net composed of some 365 individual fibers. The dye techniques used were equally sophisticated; metallic salts to improve the fastness of dyes has been found in textiles in tombs dating from before 1500 BC. These early embroideries were done with the application of precious metals, especially gold. The pure metal was beaten into thin plates, divided into small slips which were rounded by a hammer, and then filed to form wire. Few remains of ancient wire work have been found. In the late 19th century, Orientalism was very popular and tourism to the Middle East grew. Merchants in the town of Asyut began making shawls by using Turkish metal embroidery on leftover mosquito nets, perhaps in imitation of these ancient fabrics. Locally called tulle bitalli (\\"plated\\" or \\"coated\\"), it was named \\"Assuit\\" after the city in which it was sold. As it became more popular, bobbinet material was used, but it continued (and still continues) to be hand-embroidered. Uses Assuit has been used in Hollywood productions such as the lost Cecil B. DeMille opus Cleopatra. It was draped on Hedy Lamarr in Samson and Delilah. It is used extensively for dresses in old Egyptian musicals. It was also worn draped over the head, as wraps, and as wedding gowns. Folkloric Belly Dancers often make costumes from it. It can also be used for decoration: Piano shawls were extremely popular, and specimens can still be found occasionally in antique shops. Shawls come in different sizes: most are long and narrow, and the designs vary, ranging from the simple to the elaborate. Some people believe designs have been passed down through families, as with weaving and embroidery work. Some designs appear to be intentionally left incomplete. Coptic Christian designs often have animal and human figures, whereas Muslim shawls rely on geometric designs. In some places, assuit shawls are incorrectly referred to as Coptic shawls. The geometric designs were popular with the Art Deco movement, beginning around 1925.

Life and career Irving Bieber was born in New York City and graduated from New York University Medical College in 1930. Bieber went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where he taught a course in psychoanalysis. Bieber was, along with Lionel Ovesey and Charles Socarides, one of the most influential American psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality. Bieber's 1962 book Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals was a counter reaction to the 1948 Kinsey Report on male sexual behavior. It remained the leading study on homosexuality until homosexuality was removed from DSM-III in 1973.William J. Spurlin, 'Culture, Rhetoric, and Queer Identity', James Baldwin Now, ed. Dwight A. McBride, New York University Press, 1999, pages 107-108 In 1970, Bieber attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was protested by members of the Gay Liberation Front. According to Socarides, Bieber, who felt he had \\"been working all these years to help these people\\", \\"took this very hard.\\" In 1973, the same year the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, Bieber told an interviewer that \\"a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim.\\" When Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith's study Sexual Preference was published in 1981, Bieber declared that its findings were \\"totally disparate\\" with his experience from psychiatric consultation. Bieber arranged a partial translation into English of a paper by the Hungarian pediatrician S. Lindner, who had reported a systematic study of sucking. Sigmund Freud had used Lindner's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either sleep or an orgasm-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in Freud's use of this paper. Bieber died in Manhattan in 1991. Books =Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals= Homosexuality offered a view of homosexuality as an illness that has since been discredited. The book has been criticized for examining homosexuals already in analytic treatment as opposed to non-patient heterosexuals. It has been suggested that the study informed stereotypes later promulgated by the media. For example, in 1964 Life magazineLife, June 26, 1964, page 68 featured an article on homosexuals and smothering mothers directly inspired by this study. Despite its discrediting, Homosexuality continued to be read and taught in psychopathology courses in universities in the 1980s.Lewes 1988. pp. 184, 207.

The White Ship was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials, which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first. However, when the ship set off in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock and the ship quickly capsized and sank.

Stewart, A Descriptive catalogue of the oriental library of late Tipoo Sultan of Mysore, pp 18 The first part of both books are the same, but the later part contains an additional history of Khan Jehan Lodhi. The material is part fictional, part historical. The book is a major source of tradition relating to the origins of the Pashtun. It also covers Pashtun rulers in Bengal, contemporary events, and Pashtun hagiography. It plays a large part in various theories which have been offered about the possibility that the Pashtun people are descended from the Israelites, through the Ten Lost Tribes. Origin theories The Bani-Israelite theory about the origin of the Pashtuns is based on Pashtun oral traditions; the tradition itself was documented in the Makhzan-i-Afghani, which is the only written source addressing Pashtun origins. The Makhzan traces the Pashtuns' origins from the Patriarch Abraham down to a king named King Talut (Saul). Makhzan to this point agrees with testimony provided by Muslim sources or Hebrew Scriptures, showing King Saul around B.C. 1092 in Palestine. It is beyond this point that the description comes under serious doubt. =Pashtun ancestry= According to Nimat Allah, Qais was the ancestor of most of the existing Pashtun tribes.

The body of the church has been demolished but the tower still stands. The tower is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The site of the church is a Scheduled Monument. History The Domesday Book contains a reference to a priest in Wybunbury. The church was broken into in 1464, the cross was broken and valuables were stolen. The thieves were caught and hung. The tower was built in the 15th century on the site of the earlier church. By 1750 its foundations were observed to be settling and the tower was beginning to lean. In the early 1790s the church was repaired or rebuilt. In 1833 the body of the church was demolished; James Trubshaw then straightened the tower by removing soil from the higher side and soaking the ground so that the tower settled back straight. He rebuilt the body of the church in a style loosely based on the previous building. This church was replaced in 1892‚Äì93 by a church designed by James Brooks, which in turn was demolished around 1976. The tower was saved from demolition by a group of villagers who formed the Wybunbury Tower Preservation Trust. The technique used by Trubshaw formed the basis of the method used in the 1990s to stabilise the Leaning Tower of Pisa. As at least five and possibly more churches on this site have become unsafe and been demolished due to ground movement; the replacement church was built in 1978 on a site elsewhere in the village and contains several items from previous churches. Architecture Only the tower now remains and Richards considers that it is one of the finest towers in Cheshire. It still leans to the north. It is built in sandstone ashlar with a lead roof. The tower is square and has five stages. The west doorway is deeply recessed and immediately above it is a window of three lights. On each side of the door and of the window are niches containing statues, possibly of bishops, while over the window is a fifth niche containing a statue of the Trinity. The fourth stage has a square wrought iron clock face. The fifth stage has two two-light belfry openings. The parapet is battlemented with crocketed pinnacles at the corners. The tower contains a ring of six bells which were cast in 1791 by John Rudhall. Other features The lych gate still stands and it serves as a war memorial.

History Children‚Äôs ward at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in 1954, showing more than 100 persons being helped to breathe by the Iron lung There have been many attempts to manage head injuries throughout history including trepanned skulls found from ancient Egypt and descriptions of treatments to decrease brain swelling in ancient Greek text. Intensive care begin with centers to treat the poliomyelitis outbreak during the mid-twentieth century. These early respiratory care units utilized a negative and positive pressure unit called the ‚ÄúIron Lung‚Äù to aid patients in respiration and greatly decreased the mortality rate of Polio. Dr. Bj√∏rn Aage Ibsen, a physician in Denmark, \\"birthed the intensive care unit‚Äù, when he used tracheostomy and positive pressure manual ventilation to keep polio patients alive in the setting of an influx of patients and limited resources (only one iron Lung). American neurosurgeon and scientist. The first neurological intensive care unit was created by Dr. Dandy Walker at Johns Hopkins in 1929. Dr. Walker realized that some surgical patient could use specialized postoperative neurosurgical monitoring and treatment. The unit Dr. Walker created showed a benefit to postoperative patients, than neurologic patients came to the unit. Dr. Safar created the first intensive care unit in the United States in Baltimore in the 1950s. In the 1970s, the benefit of specialized care in respiratory and cardiac ICUs led to the Society of Critical Care medicine being formed. This body created standards for extensive, difficult medical problems and treatments. Over time the need for specialized monitoring and treatments led to neurologic intensive care units. Modern neurocritical care began to develop in the 1980s. The Neurocritical care society was founded in 2002. In 2005, Neurocritical care was recognized as a neurological subspecialty. Scope The doctors who practice this type of medicine are called neurointensivists, and can have medical training in many fields, including neurology, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, or neurosurgery. Common diseases treated in neurointensive care units include strokes, ruptured aneurysms, brain and spinal cord injury from trauma, seizures (especially those that last for a long period of time- status epilepticus, and/or involve trauma to the patient, i.e., due to a stroke or a fall), swelling of the brain (Cerebral edema), infections of the brain (encephalitis) and the brain's or spine's meninges (meningitis), brain tumors (especially malignant cases; with neurological oncology), and weakness of the muscles required to breathe (such as the diaphragm). Besides dealing with critical illness of the nervous system, neurointensivists also treat the medical complications that may occur in their patients, including those of the heart, lung, kidneys, or any other body system, including treatment of infections. Neurointensive care centers Neurological Intensive care units are specialized units in select tertiary care centers that specialized in the care of critical ill neurological and post neurological surgical patients. The goal of NICUs are to provide early and aggressive medical interventions including managing pain, airways, ventilation, anticoagulation, elevated ICP, cardiovascular stability and secondary brain injury. Admission criteria includes: Impaired consciousness, impaired ability to protect airway, progressive respiratory weakness, need for mechanical ventilation, seizure, Radiologic evidence of elevated ICP, monitoring of neurologic function in patients that are critically ill. Neuro-ICU have been seeing increasing use at Tertiary referral hospital. One of the main reasons why Neuro-ICUs have seen increased use is the use of therapeutic hypothermia which has been shown to improve long-term neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest. Neurointensive care team Most neurocritical care units are a collaborative effort between neurointensivists, neurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists, pharmacists, physician extenders (such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants), critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, rehabilitation therapists, and social workers who all work together in order to provide coordinated care for the critically ill neurologic patient. Neurointensive care procedures Hypothermia: One third to half of people with coronary artery disease will have an episode where their heart stops. Of the patients who have their heart stopped seven to thirty percent leave the hospital with good neurological outcome (conscious, normal brain function, alert, capable of normal life). Lowering patients body temperature between 32 -34 degrees within six hours of arriving at the hospital doubles the patients with no significant brain damage compared to no cooling and increases survival of patients. ICU Monitor (front) Basic life support monitoring: Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, assessment of comatose patients. Neurological monitoring : Serial neurologic examination, assessment of comatose patients (Glasgow Coma Scale plus pupil or four score), ICP (subarachnoid hemorrhages, TBI, Hydrocephalus, Stroke, CNS infection, Hepatic failure), multimodality monitoring to monitor disease and prevent secondary injury in states that are insensitive to neurological exam or conditions confounded by sedation, neuromuscular blockade and coma. Intracranial pressure (ICP) management: Ventricular catheter to monitor Brain oxygen and concentrations of glucose and PH. With treatment options of Hypertonic serum, barbiturates, hypothermia and decompressive hemi-craniotomy Common neurointensive care illnesses and treatments Traumatic brain injury: Sedation, ICP monitoring and management, Decompressive Craniectomy, Hyperosmolar therapy and maintain hemodynamic stability. MCA-Stroke-Brain-Human-2 Stroke: Airway management, Maintenance of blood pressure and cerebral perfusion, intravenous fluid management, Temperature control, prophylaxis against seizures, nutrition, ICP management and treatment of medical complications. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Find the cause of hemorrhage, treat aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation if necessary, monitor for clinical deterioration, manage systemic complications and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and prevent vasospasm and bridge patient to angiographic clipping. Status epilepticus: Termination of seizures, prevention of seizure recurrence, treatment of cause of seizure, management of complications, monitoring of hemodynamic stability and continuous Electroencephalography(EEG). Meningitis: Empirical treatment with antibiotics and maintain hemodynamic stability. Encephalitis: Airway protection, monitoring of ICP, treatment of seizures if necessary, and sedation if patient is agitated and virial testing hemodynamic stability. Acute parainfectious inflammatory encephalopathy (Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Acute hemorrhagic leucoencephalitis (AHL)) : high dose corticosteroids, monitoring of hemodynamic stability. Multiple sclerosis, Autonomic neuropathy, spinal cord lesion and neuromuscular disease causing respiratory failure: Monitor respiration and respiratory assistance, if necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability. Tissue plasminogen activator: Monitor patient who receive TPA for 24 hours for brain bleeds.

It was written by Richard Matheson and directed by Terence Fisher. The film stars Christopher Lee, Charles Gray, Nik√© Arrighi and Leon Greene. It is considered one of Terence Fisher's best films.  Plot  Set in London and the south of England in 1929, the story finds Nicholas, Duc de Richleau (Christopher Lee), investigating the strange actions of the son of a friend, Simon Aron (Patrick Mower), who has a house replete with strange markings and a pentagram. He quickly deduces that Simon is involved with the occult. De Richleau and Rex Van Ryn (Leon Greene) manage to rescue Simon and another young initiate, Tanith (Nik√© Arrighi), from a devil-worshipping cult. During the rescue, they disrupt a ceremony on Salisbury Plain, in which the Devil, the \\"Goat of Mendes\\" (Baphomet) appears. They escape to the home of the Eatons, Marie (Sarah Lawson) and Richard (Paul Eddington), friends of de Richleau and Van Ryn, and are followed by the group's leader, Mocata (Charles Gray), who has a psychic connection to the two initiates. After visiting the house while de Richleau is absent to discuss the matter and an unsuccessful attempt to influence the initiates to return, Mocata forces de Richleau and the other occupants to defend themselves through a night of black magic attacks, ending with the conjuring of the Angel of Death. De Richleau repels the angel, but it kills Tanith instead (as, once summoned, it must take a life). His attacks defeated, Mocata kidnaps the Eatons' young daughter Peggy (Rosalyn Landor). The Duc has Tanith's spirit possess Marie in order to find Mocata, but they only are able to get a single clue, and Rex realizes that the cultists are at a house he visited earlier. Simon tries to rescue Peggy on his own, but he is recaptured by the cult. De Richleau, Richard, and Rex also try to rescue her, but they are defeated by Mocata. Suddenly, a powerful force (or Tanith herself) controls Marie and ends Peggy's trance. She then leads Peggy in the recitation of a spell which visits divine retribution on the cultists and transforms their coven room into a church. When the Duc and his companions awaken, they discover that the spell has reversed time and changed the future in their favour. Simon and Tanith have survived, and Mocata's spell to conjure the Angel of Death has been reflected back on him. Divine judgement ends his life, and he is subject to eternal damnation for his unholy summoning of the Angel of Death. De Richleau comments that it is God to whom they must be thankful.

Production began on 7 August 1967, and the film starred Christopher Lee (in a rare heroic role), Charles Gray, Nik√© Arrighi and Leon Greene. The screenplay was adapted by Richard Matheson from Wheatley's novel. Christopher Lee had often stated that of all his vast back catalogue of films, this was his favourite and the one he would have liked to have seen remade with modern special effects and with his playing a mature Duke de Richleau. The A-side of British rock band Icarus's debut single \\"The Devil Rides Out\\" was inspired by the advance publicity for the film of the same title. Though the song does not appear in the film, the single's release was timed to coincide with the film's premiere and the band was invited to the premiere.Wells, David (May 2007). In The Marvel World of Icarus [CD booklet]. Wooden Hill. Pages 4‚Äì15.  Analysis of themes  Unlike certain other Hammer films, The Devil Rides Out has little sexual or violent content. The film's tone is serious, lacking the intentional camp and tongue-in-cheek style of many other Hammer titles. Paul Leggett, in his study of Terence Fisher's films, describes The Devil Rides Out, despite its occult themes, as a \\"total conquest of Christianity over the forces of evil\\". Leggett sees the film's script drawing inspiration from the works of Charles Williams and C.S. Lewis in addition to Wheatley's novel. The film portrays in a serious manner a spiritual reality underlying the physical universe, and the skeptics of the supernatural becoming unwitting allies of evil. Professor Peter Hutchings stated that the film has noticeable paternalistic themes: the struggle between good and evil is set up with the older male \\"savant\\" authority figures (Duke de Richleau and Mocata), while the younger characters are incapable of defending themselves without subjecting to their authorities.  Reception  Reviews of the film have been widely favorable. It currently has a 93% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. =Box office= According to Fox records the film required $1,150,000 in rentals to break even, but by 11 December 1970 it had only made $575,000, making it a loss to the studio.

National regulation In 2007 the Health Professions Council (HPC), which is independent of any professional body, released a white paper, Trust Assurance and Safety ‚Äì The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century, which said that the Government intended to introduce statutory regulation for psychotherapists and counsellors. The HPC set up a working group of stakeholders, known as a Professional Liaison Group, to consider and make recommendations to the HPC about how psychotherapists and counsellors might be regulated, in light of the statements made in the white paper. The HPC held a public consultation on the PLG recommendations, which ran for three months in 2009. Following the consultation, the PLG was reconvened and had its last meeting on 2 February 2011. In February 2011, the Government published a command paper, Enabling Excellence, which set out the coalition government's policy on professional regulation. The paper outlined a system of what it called \\"assured voluntary registration\\" and said that in the future statutory regulation will only be considered where there is a \\"compelling case\\", and where \\"voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk\\". Later that month, the HPC's Chief Executive Marc Seale wrote to Anne Milton MP, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, seeking clarification of the coalition government's policy on the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors. At its meeting on 31 March 2011 the Council discussed the response received from Anne Milton MP. The letter said: \\"...it is not currently our intention to proceed with statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors\\". Counselling organisations ;The British Association For Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) The largest UK counselling organisation is the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). It grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded. In 1978 the headquarters was moved from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself. In September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented just counselling, but also psychotherapy. It changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). BACP is now the largest and broadest body within the sector with approximately 26,000 individual members. BACP participates in the development of counselling and psychotherapy at an international level. BACP is recognised by most health providers and claims a membership of several thousand. ;The Survivors Trust According to the introduction on their main website The Survivors Trust is a national umbrella agency for over 125 specialist voluntary sector agencies throughout the UK and Ireland providing a range of counselling, therapeutic and support services working with women, men and children who are victims/survivors of rape, sexual violence and sexual abuse.http://www.thesurvivorstrust.org/ The organisation aims to offer a national collective voice to support and empower survivor groups, to educate and inform acknowledgment of and response to sexual abuse on a local and national level. ;The National Counselling Society The National Counselling Society (NCS) is a not-for-profit membership organisation, founded by a group of counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists and hypnotherapists in 1999. The aim of the NCS is to promote and support the practice of counselling, and does so by offering a range of services to members, including a comprehensive training programme. The NCS also benefits the patients of counsellors by ensuring that the counsellors in their organisation follow their stringent code of ethics; facing expulsion if they deviate or break any of their established codes of conduct and practice. ;COSCA (Counselling & Psychotherapy in Scotland) COSCA is a professional body for counselling and psychotherapy in Scotland, which seeks to advance all forms of counselling and psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills. According to the organisations website, COSCA's aims are to increase accessibility to counselling and psychotherapy, develop ethically-based professional standards and quality assurance for counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills, increase access to training and information on counselling, psychotherapy and counselling skills, deliver a range of services that meet the needs of the counselling and psychotherapy field, provide opportunities for sharing knowledge, experience and resources for the advancement of counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills in Scotland. ;The Counselling Society The Counselling Society is one of a number of UK counselling professional organisations. According to the introduction on their website in 2007, the Counselling Society launched a campaign by contacting every UK MP, Peer and other national stakeholder via Blake's Parliamentary Yearbook. It proposed a criminal offence of ‚Äúabuse by a healthcare professional‚Äù which would include counsellors as a matter of public safety.

After the initial negotiations by the SLMM to open the gates failed, the Air Force attacked LTTE positions on July 26, and ground troops began an operation to open the gates. Following these moves, the political leader of the LTTE S Elilan announced an end to the cease-fire although Palitha Kohona, a government spokesman, stated that the government remained committed to the cease-fire. The sluice gates were eventually reopened on August 8, with conflicting reports as to who actually opened them. Initially, the SLMM claimed that they managed to persuade the LTTE to lift the waterway blockade conditionally.slmm attempt However a government spokesman said that \\"utilities can not be used as bargaining tools\\" by the rebels and the government forces launched fresh attacks on LTTE positions around the reservoir.

Plot Benjamin (Morris Chestnut) is an aspiring songwriter who attempts to break into the music business by giving a copy of his recording track of a Christmas album to a rap artist named J-Jizzy (Charles Q. Murphy). Nancy (Union) is a divorced mother, who is too busy taking care of her three children to take care of herself. Her daughter Emily (Khail Bryant) overhears her mother say that she wished for a compliment from a man, and the daughter tells the local mall's Santa Claus about her mother's wish. The Santa Claus turns out to be Benjamin, who notices Nancy. Later, while sitting in a Starbucks after his shift as Santa, Benjamin and his friend Jamal (Faizon Love) see Nancy go into a dry cleaners. Benjamin borrows Jamal's jacket, pretends to drop it off at the cleaners, tells Nancy that she's a very attractive woman (granting her wish), and leaves. Eventually, the two start to date and end up falling in love‚Äîwithout Ben realizing that Nancy's ex-husband is J-Jizzy. Things take a turn for the worse, however, because Nancy's oldest son, John-John (Malik Hammond) is jealous of Benjamin going out with his mother and plots to break up the relationship. What follows is a series of funny and touching scenes that show viewers what \\"family\\" is really about. Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard play omniscient roles in the movie. Howard is a mischievous and sly angel named \\"Bah Humbug\\", while Latifah is the kind, thoughtful angel, called \\"Mrs. Christmas\\".

In 1582 he married Margaret Tyldesley.Lostock - manor and township (British History Online). URL accessed 17 November 2007.Lostock Village - Andertons. URL accessed 17 November 2007. Like his father he became a lawyer, and in 1592 succeeded his father as Prothonotary of the Duchy Court at Lancaster. Both his mother and his wife were faithful Catholics, but like his father, he temporized. In 1603 he signed a loyal address from all the gentry of Lancaster welcoming James I on his progress to London. He was credited with the Catholic work \\"The Protestant's Apologie\\", \\"The Lyturgie of the Masse\\", \\"The Reformed Protestant\\" and \\"Luther's Life\\". It has been claimed that the real author of these works was his nephew, the Jesuit Laurence Anderton although this assertion has been proved to be spurious in recent years.A.F. Allison, \\"Who was John Brereley?\\", Recusant History 16 (1982), pp. 17-40. Anderton was responsible for setting up a Catholic press at his brother's home of Birchley Hall, approximately from Lostock. Around 20 works were published from this clandestine press between 1615 and 1621, although it is thought that the press was established as early as 1613. Anderton died on 7 September 1613, having been fully reconciled to the Catholic faith. He left ¬£1500 to the maintenance of the Catholic priesthood in England, a sum of money that the Privy Council and Bishop of Chester became interested in capturing. They never did. He was widely respected by Catholics of his day. His \\"Apologie\\" was translated on the continent into Latin in 1615, and the two editions of the work, published in 1604 and 1608, both got responses from Thomas Morton, the King's chaplain and the man responsible for getting John Donne into holy orders.

Lennoxtown Training Centre is Celtic F.C.'s training centre, located at Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire in Scotland. The complex houses the club's training and educational facilities. Background The complex is built on former NHS land adjacent to the vacated Lennox Castle Hospital and was designed to replace Celtic's former training ground at Barrowfield. It is located on a site near the Campsie Fells, half of the site has been developed in Phase One of the project to provide the existing training facilities with the remaining land being left for development in Phase Two which will provide conference facilities and live-in dormitory areas for young players. The centre houses Celtic‚Äôs entire professional footballing operation and will host the home games for Celtic's ladies team. For many years the training facilities which Celtic provided were seen as substandard and would be hidden from potential new signings. This fact was emphasised after their rivals Rangers opened their Auchenhowie complex in 2001 and Hearts opened their Riccarton academy with Heriot-Watt University in 2004. A number of club officials and players expressed sadness at leaving Barrowfield but saw it as a necessity for the modern game and that it would aid in helping Celtic attract players to the club. Prior to its opening Celtic youth team coach Willie McStay stated \\"after years of shuttling back and forth between Barrowfield, Celtic Park and several other temporary training venues, Lennoxtown will also allow the Youth Academy coaching staff to better utilise their time during the course of a season.\\" In 2005, Celtic launched a successful share issue which raised ¬£15m, much of this money would be put towards providing new training facilities. Celtic coach Tommy Burns was tasked with undertaking a fact finding mission and travelled across Europe to visit other football clubs' training grounds. Celtic chose sections from Burns's report and this was added to by former Celtic bosses Martin O'Neill and Gordon Strachan. In December 2005, East Dunbartonshire Council's Planning Board approved the outline planning application to develop the training facilities on the site. The following April, the council granted a detailed permission with the leader of East Dunbartonshire Council, John Morrison, stating \\"I'm sure that the residents of East Dunbartonshire are delighted at the prospect of this ambitious development in their area. The Celtic training facility will potentially contribute significantly to the development of Lennoxtown and will also bring wider employment and social benefits to the area.\\". Official opening The centre was officially opened on 9 October 2007 by Celtic chairman Brian Quinn at a ceremony where he was joined by Chief executive Peter Lawwell, then Celtic manager Gordon Strachan and then Celtic captain Stephen McManus. Chairman Brian Quinn added \\"When people come and see the facilities they'll see what I think we are, which is a major European club\\". At the opening of the centre Peter Lawwell stated that Celtic \\"now have a foundation and infrastructure that should take us forward.\\" and that Celtic can \\"now demonstrate a world-class training centre on top of a world-class stadium, for what I believe is a world-class club. It‚Äôs fitting for a club of this stature\\". Facilities ¬£8 million was spent on the construction. Indoor facilities include an indoor training hall, a fitness centre with gym and fitness suite, physio and medical facilities, sauna and steam room and hydrotherapy pool, Sports science/sports development facility, changing facilities, classroom/education facilities, football administration offices, media facilities, kit room, laundry and Groundsman‚Äôs compound. Outdoor facilities include three full-sized UEFA standard natural grass training and match pitches, with undersoil heating to the main pitch, an artificial grass pitch and an additional goalkeeping training area. The Lennoxtown complex is just over from Rangers Training Centre, also in East Dunbartonshire (as the crow flies). Coincidentally, this is almost exactly the same as the distance across the city of Glasgow between the two clubs' main stadia. Site split plan In 2019, Celtic announced plans to redevelop their older Barrowfield facilities in Glasgow for use by the academy and women's team, including an indoor pitch and a matchday venue augmenting the Lennoxtown base which would continue to be used by the first team squad.Celtic pitch plans for Barrowfield training ground expansion, Urban Realm, 6 June 2019Celtic FC lodges plans for training centre redevelopment, Scottish Construction Now, 6 June 2019Celtic announce major east end re-development plans, Glasgow Live, 5 June 2019Celtic to redevelop Barrowfield training ground, BBC Sport, 5 June 2019Celtic submit new training centre plans including indoor pitch at Barrowfield, Glasgow Times, 20 December 2019 Gallery Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown7.jpgCeltic crest on glazed lobby Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown14.jpgTraining centre and astroturf pitch Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown13.jpgAstro-turf pitches Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown12.jpgTraining centre during finishing stages of construction Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown11.jpgTraining centre and main pitch File:LennoxtownGround.jpgSetting beneath Campsie Fell Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown8.jpgRear of training centre during finishing stages of construction File:LennoxtownLobby.jpgClose up of entrance lobby Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown4.jpgMain training pitches Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown2.jpgSide access to training facility Image:Alanmaguirelennoxtown1.jpgSide elevation Image:Lennoxtown training complex from the air.jpgAerial view References External links * Chairman's address at the opening of the facility * Video showing the facilities at Lennoxtown Category:Celtic F.C.

They are a Sino-Tibetan-speaking ethnic group of the eastern Terai. They mainly reside in Morang and Jhapa districts of Nepal and Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. Several scholars both in India and Nepal have referred to Dhimals as a 'forgotten ethnic group'. They are scions of the Bodo-Kachari (also Kachari or Bodo\\"The term Bodo is also used to denote a large number of tribes-the Garos of Meghalaya, Tippera of Tripura, and Boro Kachari, Koch, Rabha, Lalung, Dimasa, Hajong, Chutia, Deuri, and Moran of Assam and other parts of the Northeast. (M N Brahma, \\"The Bodo-Kacharis of Assam-A brief Introduction\\" in Bulletin of the Tribal Research Institute [Gauhati], 1:1 [1983], p.52)\\" ) lineage, which includes Bodos, Dimasas, Tiprasas, Rabhas, Tiwas, Sonowals and many others. They are respected as the \\"First Citizens\\" of Damak municipality. Ethnicity and language They are an indigenous group of Nepal and belong to Sino-Tibetan group. Their facial features, language and religious practices are close to those of the Limbu people and Koch of Terai and of the northern hills. They also show the characteristic habits, quick temper and aggressiveness of the Limbu, Koch Rajbanshi and Kirati people. However, they have their own language, culture and customs. Dhimals consider themselves of Kirati descent. They consider the Limbu and Koch people of the hills as their brethren. According to Hodgson the Mech, Bodo, koch and Dhimal tribes are of the same race; however, comparison of language does not support so close a connection, he added. He stated that \\"‚Ä¶ but it is difficult to suppose the Bodo and Dhimal languages other than primitive\\". He also stated that the Dhimals are \\"‚Ä¶ nomadic cultivators of wild. For ages transcending memory or tradition, they have passed beyond the savage or hunter state, and also beyond the herdsman's state, and have advanced to the third or agricultural grade of social progress, but so as to indicate a not entirely broken connection with the precedent condition of things ‚Ä¶ They never cultivate the same field beyond the second year, or remain in the same village beyond from four to six years\\". He again identified the barter system for the few things which they require and do not produce themselves. The Dhimal language is part of the Sino-Tibetan family. It is closely related to another aboriginal language of the Himalayas, Toto. Religion and culture Their animistic religion is very close to the Kirant religion. They worship nature and other household gods. Hodgson identified their religion as the religion of nature, or rather, the natural religion of man have neither temple nor idol; their cultivation as shifting cultivation; and \\"this race assure him that they once had chiefs when they dwelt as a united people in Morang\\". The religion, as identified by Hodgson, is very different from Hinduism as they have neither temples nor idols. \\"Altogether, their religion belongs to the same primitive era as their habits and manners\\", Hodgson added. Dhimal population According to the 2011 census in Nepal, Dhimal population was about 12 thousand. In India, they reside in 16 villages, namely Naxalbari and Hatighisha in Darjeeling district, West Bengal. Occupation Dhimals are cultivators, although the frequencies of labourers, including agricultural labourers or to some extent tea garden labourers, may not be overlooked. These days the Indian Dhimals are exclusively concentrated at Hatighisha and Maniram Gram Panchayat of Naxalbari Police Station under Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. However, sporadic occurrences of Dhimal population may have seen outside the above-said areas but within Darjeeling district of West Bengal. Even this diminutive group sometimes misleads as vanishing races by some amateurs. Their counterpart of Nepal, with whom they have a marital relation and belongs to the same (biological) population, have better numerical strength, socio-economic and educational attainment of their own. The Dhimals of Nepal receive much importance in various writings of Nepali scholars. On the other hand, the Indian Dhimals have been neglected by the government and others in any field of development. Anthropological documents on the Indian Dhimal is yet to be received; some sporadic documents by amateurs and some field-based study by trained scholars in a part of Dhimal population may be available but all of them cover social- cultural-linguistics aspects only, and physical or demographic data on the entire population are literally absent. Dhimal women are good at weaving and have their unique dress among the ethnic peoples of Nepal. Research The first identified study on Dhimal of this region may be attributed to English administrators of British India. As per present knowledge the first report in the form of monograph on Dhimal was written by Brain Houghton Hodgson (1847) entitled \\"Essays the first on the Kocch, Bodo and Dhimal Tribes\\". The monograph dealt with the Vocabulary, Grammar and Location, Numbers, Creed, Customs, Condition and Physical and Moral Characteristics of the People. Later on Hodgson published the third part in 1849 in Journal of Asiatic Society, entitled \\"On the Origin, Location, Numbers, Creed, Customs, Characters and Condition of the Kocch, Bodo and Dhimal People, with a general description of the climate they dwelt in\\" (Hodgson 1849). Trubner and Co. in 1880 published the same original collection of 1847 in the book entitled \\"Miscellaneous Essays relating to Indian Subjects, Vol-I\\" (Hodgson 1880). Hodgson enumerated the number of Dhimals between Konki and Dhorla as below 15,000. Hodgson stated that Dhimal \\"‚Ä¶do not now exceed 15,000 souls, are at present confined to that portion of Saul forest lying between the Konki and the Dharla or Torsha, mixed with the Bodo but in separate villages and without intermarriage\\". Latham (1859) in ‚ÄòDescriptive Ethnology‚Äô identified the place of Dhimals as unfavourable and full of malaria, though, he stated \\"‚Ä¶yet the Dhimal, the Bodo, and others thrive in it, love it, leave it with regret\\". He believes that Dhimals are separated from Bodos as language, pantheons, marriage ceremony, funerals even festivals of the two are very different. Latham also identified Hodgson's work as \\"a model of an ethnological monograph\\". After that all writings are more or less influenced by and borrowed data from Hodgson's writings. Among them the writing of Edward Twite Dalton (1872) may be mentioned. Dalton in his ‚ÄòDescriptive Ethnology of Bengal‚Äô identified Dhimals as tribe of Assam valley, clubbed with the Kacharis or Bodo and Mech; and stated \\" Hodgson describes the Bodo and Dhimal tribe as of the same race, and there appears no reason for separating them in a work of this nature, as their customs, religion, etc. appear nearly identical\\". W. W. Hunter (1876) in \\"Statistical Account of Bengal\\" stated that census report distinguishes between these peoples (Dhimals and Meches or Bodos), and returns the number of Dhimals at 873. Later on he wrote a brief note on Dhimal culture which are, as per Hunter, is a condensed form of Hodgson's work. Sannial (1880) when studied Dhimals found hunting and pastoralism as their main source of occupation. He also stated that the village was headed by a headman called ‚ÄòMondal‚Äô and magico-religious practices by Dhami, Deushi and Ojha. Dhimal again finds their position in H. H. Risley's \\"The Tribes and Castes of Bengal\\" where Risley pointed out that \\"Dhimal, Dhemal, Maulik, a non-Aryan tribe of the Darjeeling and Nepal Terai ‚Ä¶. belong to the same main stock with Kocch ‚Ä¶ rapidly losing their tribal identity by absorption into the large heterogeneous Rajbansi caste\\". He also pointed out a marked advanced direction towards Hinduism from nature worship. Risley opined that \\"they seem likely to disappear altogether as a separate tribe within the next generation\\" (Risley, 1891). Bandyopadhyay (1895) in his Darjeeling Probasir Patra stated that the cultural aspects of Meches and Dhimals are more or less same, even the folklore, Bandyopadhyay collected, indicates the same origin of Dhimals with Koch and Meches. O‚ÄôMalley (1907) in his ‚ÄòDistrict Gazetteers of Darjeeling‚Äô classified Dhimals as non- Hinduized Koch or Rajbansi and identified their (Dhimal) habitat as \\"marshy tract, formerly covered by dense malarious jungle, in which aboriginal tribes of Meches, Dhimals and Koches burnt clearings and raised their scanty crops of rice and cotton on a system, if system it can be called, of nomadic husbandry\\". Grierson (1926) in ‚ÄòLinguistic Survey of India‚Äô classified Dhimal language as ‚ÄòEastern Pronominalized group‚Äô of ‚ÄòPronominalized Himalayan Group‚Äô under ‚ÄòTibeto Himalaya Branch‚Äô of ‚ÄòTibeto-Burman subfamily‚Äô which may be categorized under ‚ÄòTibeto-Chinese group‚Äô. He also stated that \\"In the Pronominalized group the influence of the ancient Munda language is far more apparent\\". Endle (1911) placed Dhimals under Northern groups of Kachari family along with Kachari, Rabha, Mech, Koch and others. Later on Das (1978) examined the same and opined the possibility of same ethnological relationship between these tribes. Deb Burman and Chaudhuri (1999) identified Dhimals as a backward community having tribal origin and \\"acceptance of Mallick or Maulik title as well as adoption of Hindu religious practices is the stereotype for not considering them tribe. But the strong argument in favour of noninclusion of the Dhimals in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of India could be their migration to the neighboring countries like Nepal and Bhutan at the time of enumeration\\", they added. Roy (1999) in his unpublished M. Phil. dissertation noted the prevalence of ‚Äòbarter system‚Äô in Dhimal community of this region. Some recent studies on vernacular language also exhibit the above stated characteristics, many of which are typical tribal characters of their own. Moitra (2004) identified a close affinity between Dhimal and Toto languages; he even calculated the separation of Toto from Dhimal, by grutochronological analysis, as 800-1200 AD. Royburman (1959) in his thesis on Toto also highlighted the same by stated \\"there is one variant of Toto myth of origin which refers to the Dhimals as the mother group. (Toto) assess the very close affinity exists between the language of the Totos and the Dhimal\\" but, he added, \\"as, however, I do not possess any scientifically assessed data, I do not propose to enter into the realm of social psychology\\". King (1994) after his linguistic survey opined that its (Dhimal) closest relative appears to be Toto (IIAS 2007). Among Nepali scholars who have done ethnographical and social-cultural aspects on Nepali Dhimals the following names is of great important. Bista (1980) identified Dhimals as nomadic, practicing shifting cultivation until some times ago, they have traditional village councils with a headman called Deonia and the priest who presides over all of the religious function is called Dhami. Regmi (1991) identified a total of 13 exogamous patrilineal clans and 11 sub-clans within the population. Gautam and Thapa- Magar (1994) also classified Dhimals as Tribes in their work \\"Tribal Ethnography of Nepal\\". In a recent work Bisht and Bankoti (2004) also followed the same trend by placing Dhimals on \\"Encyclopedic Ethnography of the Himalayan Tribes\\". There is a continuous census enumeration on Dhimal population (or sometimes language spoken) up to 1951 except 1941. The 1872 census identified Dhimals as Aboriginal Tribe. The 1891 census headed by O‚ÄôDonnell identified Dhimals as Forest and Hill Tribes as well as Agriculturalist by occupation. But next census headed by E. A. Gait classified Dhimals as Hindu by religion; even the census stated that they (Dhimals) often called themselves as Rajbansi. The same trend was carried over by 1931 census headed by Porter. The 1961 census has lost Dhimal data but even it stated Dhimals as Aboriginal tribes as per 1872. After that no single census (1971, 1981, 1991, 2001) have been drawing any traces on Dhimal community or languages, though some very small population even with single household was being considered for the study Now, after a transitional non-recognition period by the Govt. they have been classified as Other Backward Class (OBC) of West Bengal. The history of study (or not to study) on Dhimals of India narrate the negligence for which the once non-Aryan tribe of British India having no reservation on any field, have to compete with others (the recognition as OBC is a recent one, though they are not satisfied with present status and demand the status of Scheduled Tribe instead of OBCs). Because of the uneven competitions with dominant next door neighbours and others in respect of nation, push them much behind whether in the field of education, occupation or sociocultural context as a whole. Very few of them (thirteen in number) have crossed the border of Secondary education, and two of them are graduates.

Although the Witch Creek Fire was individually smaller than the Zaca Fire of 2007 (which burned at least ), burning acres alone, after merging with the Poomacha and McCoy Fires, the Witch‚ÄìGuejito‚ÄìPoomacha Complex Fire had a total burn area of , surpassing the Zaca Fire to become the largest complex fire of 2007. Initially igniting in Witch Creek Canyon, near Santa Ysabel, the Witch Creek Fire rapidly spread westward, fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds, and consumed large portions of San Diego County. On October 25, the Witch Fire merged with the Poomacha Fire to the north, near Palomar Mountain, before also merging with the smaller McCoy Fire on the next day. The Witch‚ÄìPoomacha Complex Fire was the second-to-last fire of the 2007 October wildfires to be extinguished, with the Poomacha Fire being contained on November 13. The last remaining fire, the Harris Fire, was fully extinguished on November 16. During its duration, 80‚Äì100 feet-high flames were reported by fire officials in the Witch Fire, and the Witch Fire exhibited the characteristics of a firestorm at its height. On the morning of October 22, 2007, about a day after the Witch Creek Fire had ignited, residents of San Diego County were ordered to evacuate through the Reverse 911 system. Eventually, the Witch Creek Fire led to the evacuations of 500,000 people, 200,000 of whom lived within the City of San Diego.\\"California Wildfires Trigger Widespread Evacuations\\". NPR (2007-10-24). Retrieved on 2007-10-24. This evacuation came almost four years to the day after the Cedar Fire of 2003. The Witch Fire was a major contributor to the mass evacuations across much of Southern California at that time, which saw 1,000,000 residents evacuate, becoming the largest evacuation in California history. The Witch‚ÄìPoomacha Fire caused at least $1.3 billion (2007 USD) in insured damages alone, becoming the costliest wildfire of 2007. As of 2020, the Witch Fire is the fourteenth-largest wildfire in modern California history, as well as the sixth-most destructive wildfire on record in California. Fire progression San Diego skyline against the smoke at sunrise, on October 23, 2007. Image of the smoke-filled sky in San Diego, on the morning of October 22, 2007. The Witch Creek Fire started in Witch Creek Canyon near Santa Ysabel, at 12:35 PM PDT on Sunday, October 21, 2007, after powerful Santa Ana winds blew down a power line, releasing sparks into the wind. The Witch Fire quickly spread to San Diego Country Estates, Ramona, Rancho Bernardo, Poway, and Escondido. Locals in the San Pasqual Valley area reported wind gusts of over . From there, the fire jumped over Interstate 15 and continued west, causing significant damage in Lake Hodges, Del Dios, and Rancho Santa Fe. Strong Santa Ana winds pushed the fires west towards the coast. San Diego County Sheriff William B. Kolendar stated that the Witch Creek Fire could be \\"well in excess of the Cedar Fire of 2003\\". While many coastal communities were evacuated as the fire moved west, the shifting winds prevented it from directly threatening those areas. By the evening of October 21, the Witch Creek Fire had expanded to . At 11:37 PM PDT on October 21, the McCoy Fire ignited in the Pine Hills area in eastern San Diego County, near Cleveland National Forest. The fire was quickly contained on October 23, after burning ; however, hotspots within the fire perimeter would continue to burn until October 26, when the wildfire eventually merged with the expanding Witch Fire. On Monday, October 22, 2007, the Santa Ana winds peaked, reaching sustained wind speeds of , with winds gusting up to . The extremely powerful Santa Ana winds fanned the wildfires in Southern California, causing many of the wildfires to rapidly expand westward. At 1:30 AM PDT on October 22, 2007, the Guejito Fire ignited southeast of the San Diego Wild Animal Park, within the San Pasqual River drainage. By 4:30 AM PDT, the Guejito Fire rapidly expanded to Interstate 15, forcing the closure of the freeway in both directions, which disrupted some evacuations from areas affected by the Witch Creek Fire. In less than an hour, the Witch Creek Fire caught up with the Guejito Fire to the west, and the two fires combined into a single, massive wildfire, before dawn. With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting over , the Witch Creek Fire then jumped over Interstate 15, rapidly burning into Rancho Bernardo. On the morning of October 22, at 5:22 AM PDT, residents located between the Del Dios Highway and State Route 56 were ordered to evacuate. A firefighter stated that the conditions they faced were \\"twice as bad\\" as the Cedar Fire in 2003, with firefighters separating houses into those that they could save and those that they couldn't. The Witch Creek Fire had become a firestorm by this time, exhibiting extreme fire behavior and long-range spotting. The Witch Creek Fire continued to race westward, and by 9:25 PM PDT, on October 22, mandatory evacuation orders had been expanded westward to Escondido and Del Mar, all the way up to the coast. By 9:30 P.M. PDT on October 22, a dispatch from the city of Del Mar's web site stated: \\"For your safety, we are strongly advising that all Del Mar residents evacuate.\\" Evacuations were also ordered for Scripps Ranch neighborhood, specifically \\"Everything south of Scripps Poway Parkway, north of MCAS Miramar, east of Interstate 15, and west of Highway 67\\". The Mesa Grande Indian Reservation was also evacuated due to the Witch Fire. Residents of the Barona Indian Reservation were advised to leave, though the evacuation was not mandatory. The casino on the reservation was closed. At approximately 01:00 UTC on October 23 (6:00 PM PDT on October 22), the Witch Fire expanded near Wildcat Canyon to the south of Barona, where many houses had been destroyed and lives lost in the Cedar Fire. Residents of Wildcat Canyon and Muth Valley were ordered to evacuate, and the road was closed. By the end of October 22, the Witch Creek Fire had exploded to an enormous , and the fire was still rapidly expanding.

At 3:13 AM PDT, on October 23, 2007, the Poomacha Fire was ignited in the La Jolla Indian Reservation in northeastern San Diego County. On the same day, the Poomacha Fire quickly exploded to , with most of that growth occurring within one and a half hours. At 9:50 P.M. PDT on October 23, 2007, the town of Julian, California was ordered to evacuate. Due to the fires, there was no power or phone service in the town. On Wednesday, October 24, 2007, the Santa Ana winds began to subside and the prevailing winds shifted directions, with the onshore flow blowing in from the west, which caused the Witch Creek Fire to reverse directions and begin burning eastward, ending the threat to the coastal communities. This also allowed the fire to burn previously-unburned fuel (which was passed over during the initial rapid spread of the fire), threatening communities further east that had so far avoided the worst of the Witch Creek Fire. On the same day, some of the evacuation orders in place for Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Pe√±asquitos, 4S Ranch, and other areas west of Rancho Bernardo were lifted, after the western part of the Witch Creek Fire was contained. However, the evacuation orders in place for eastern and northern Rancho Bernardo, around Lake Hodges, were still in place. On October 25, more of the evacuation orders for the Witch Fire around Rancho Bernardo and other neighboring communities were lifted, as the Witch Creek Fire became 45% contained, with the western portion of the fire being brought under control. On October 24, the California Highway Patrol closed Interstate 5, after the Ammo Fire burned across the freeway; the Ammo Fire also forced the closures of the Amtrak Surfliner service between Oceanside and San Clemente. These routes had previously been used to evacuate residents from the Witch Creek Fire areas. Traffic from Interstate 5 was diverted to Interstate 15, which had reopened since the portion of the Witch Creek Fire around Interstate 15 had been extinguished. Late on October 24, after the winds had reversed, the Witch Fire began approaching the nearby Poomacha Fire to the north, which was burning near Palomar Mountain, with firefighters and officials fearing that the two wildfires would soon merge. By this time, the Poomacha Fire had grown to , and also began burning towards Palomar Mountain, to the north. Despite the fact that the Poomacha Fire was still much smaller than the Witch Creek Fire, firefighters were unable to establish a fire perimeter around the younger fire, due to the fact that other larger fires had rendered available firefighters and equipment scarce for the Poomacha Fire. On October 25, the Witch Fire and the Poomacha Fire merged into one gigantic complex fire, with the two wildfires joining to the south of Palomar Mountain. By October 26, the Santa Ana winds had finally subsided and the onshore flow had fully returned, slowing down the spread of the remaining fires and also aiding firefighters in their efforts to contain the remaining wildfires. On the same day, the Witch Fire also merged with the contained McCoy Fire, which had previously burned 400 acres in the Pine Hills area, in eastern San Diego County. On November 6, 2007, the main portion of the Witch Creek Fire was 100% contained, although the Poomacha portion of the complex fire continued to burn near Palomar Mountain for another week. On November 13, 2007, the Poomacha Fire was fully contained, bringing the entire Witch‚ÄìPoomacha Complex Fire completely under control. Impacts The Witch Creek Fire forced the evacuation of at least 500,000 people from over 346,000 homes in San Diego County. Evacuation sites in San Diego County included Qualcomm Stadium, Escondido High School, Mission Hills High School, Poway High School, Mira Mesa Senior High School, and the Del Mar Fairgrounds. Many major roads were also closed as a result of the fires and smoke. On October 22, the California Highway Patrol closed Interstate 15 in both directions between State Routes 78 and 56. On October 24, 2007, the Ammo (Horno) Fire forced the closure of Interstate 5, as well as the Amtrak Surfliner service between Oceanside and San Clemente. Traffic from Interstate 5 was being diverted to Interstate 15, which had reopened. A total of 1,841 firefighters were assigned to the Witch Fire. Aftermath In addition to the costs of fighting the fire, the Witch‚ÄìPoomacha Fire is estimated to have caused an estimated $1.3 billion in insured damages, with the original Witch Fire causing over $1.142 billion in insured damages alone. The California Public Utilities Commission ruled that in the Rice fire, San Diego Gas and Electric had not trimmed back trees as state law requires. It was also at fault, the commission said, in the Witch and Guejito fires. The power line that caused the Witch fires shorted three times in three hours, but the utility didn't cut power to it for six hours. In August 2017, administrative law Judges S. Pat Tsen and Sasha Goldberg ruled that the utility did not reasonably manage its facilities and that the wildfires were not outside of its control. Therefore, they ruled that the utility could not pass its uninsured costs along to its ratepayers. The PUC agreed in early December in a 5-0 vote. The Rice Fire began when a dead tree limb fell across power lines. The Rice Fire burned , also burning across Interstate 15 in northern San Diego County, and destroyed 206 homes. The Witch and Guejito Fires combined to burn 197,000 acres, killed two people, injured 40 firefighters, and destroyed 1,141 homes and 239 vehicles. Legal claims after the fires totalled $5.6 billion, $2.4 billion after the utility settled 2,500 lawsuits for damages. The $379 million it had sought to pass along to customers represented uninsured costs.

It amends sections of Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act (MCIAA) of 1975. Contents of Act & Controversy On May 16, 2007, the U.S. state of Minnesota passed the Freedom to Breathe Act. This act protects the public from hazardous secondhand smoke by banning smoking in public places. The ban took effect October 1, 2007. Minnesota is the 17th state to enforce a statewide smoking ban. The original and major supporters of the 1975 regulations are very pleased to see the new doctrine pass through legislation and sign into law. In an inForum online article, Don Davis quoted several House Republicans against the bill. Representative Bud Heidgerken, (R-Freeport), says that the ban will hurt small enterprises and presented a kink in the State's plan. He stated, \\"You are going to vote them out of business tonight.\\" Likewise, Dennis Ozment, (R-Rosemount), stated that the passage of the bill is \\"tyranny, oppressive governmental power... This piece of legislation turned out to be just plain mean,\\" Precedence The 2007 anti-smoking act was not the first in the state to pass into law. The Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act (MCIAA) took in effect 1975. The purpose of this act was to enforce the \\"protection of the public health.\\" It prohibited smoking in areas where children, ill or injured are present. This first Minnesota act also limited smoking indoor at public places and private meetings. Exemptions Smoking is permitted in the following places: * Specified rooms in residential health care facilities * Separated, well-ventilated areas of locked psychiatric units * Specified areas for use in peer-reviewed scientific studies related to smoking * Private homes and residences when they are not in use as a place of employment * Hotel and motel guest rooms * Tobacco products shops for the purpose of sampling products * Heavy commercial vehicles * Farm vehicles and construction equipment * Buildings on family farms * Disabled veterans' rest camp * Smoking is also permitted by Native Americans as part of a traditional Native American spiritual or cultural ceremony and by actors as part of a theatrical performance. * Smoking outside, unless it is limited or prohibited by local government. Definition of 'Indoors' An indoor area is defined as the space between a floor and a ceiling that is bounded by walls covering more than 50 percent of the perimeter of the area.

It was built by Joseph and Adelicia Acklen to serve as the center of their 180-acre summer estate in what was then country outside the city, and featured elaborate gardens and a zoo. They lived much of the rest of the year on her plantations in Louisiana. The estate was sold in the late 19th century and since 1890 has been used for educational functions. It was first used as a girls academy, then as the first building of what became Belmont College and now Belmont University. Today it is operated as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History In 1849, after the death of her husband, the infamous slave trader Isaac Franklin who bequeathed his slave-trading fortune to her, the extremely wealthy widow Adelicia (Hayes) Franklin married Joseph Alexander Smith Acklen, a young attorney from Alabama. They began construction of Belle Monte (Belmont) on in Davidson County near the county seat of Nashville. It was completed by 1853 as an Italian villa- style summer home. Adelicia and Joseph used Belmont as a summer home. They lived the rest of the year on one of her seven Louisiana cotton slave plantations, which totaled . At Belmont Mansion, the Acklens built, furnished, and landscaped one of the most elaborate antebellum homes in the South, totaling 36 rooms and . The estate contained a variety of buildings, with the house situated at the top of the hill. Covered balconies with cast iron railing and trim surrounded the house to protect windows from the sun. Atop the house, a ten-foot octagonal cupola vented the house during the summer months. It was also used as an \\"astronomical observatory\\" used for viewing the stars, the estate and downtown Nashville. Beside the house, there was a T-shaped guest house and art gallery. The south wing of the guest house contained guestrooms and a bowling alley. The art gallery had a corrugated glass roof and comprised the north wing. The grounds included lavish gardens, conservatories, aviary, lake and a zoo. The conservatories housed tropical fruit and flowers, along with camellia japonica, jasmine, lilies, and cacti. The zoo featured bears, monkeys, peacocks, singing birds, a white owl, alligators from Louisiana, and a deer park. Adelicia with her horse Bucephalus. Joseph and Adelicia had six children together, but their twins died of scarlet fever at the age of 2 in 1855. In 1863, Joseph died in Louisiana, where he was supervising their plantations during the Civil War. Adelicia secretly negotiated agreements with both Union and Confederate authorities to allow 2,800 bales of her cotton to be shipped to Liverpool, England, and sold for a total of $960,000. Despite a two-week occupation by Union General Thomas J. Wood prior to the Battle of Nashville, Belmont Mansion and its contents went undamaged during the Civil War. Only the grounds, where 13,000 Union troops spent those first two weeks of December 1864, suffered damage. Immediately following the war, Adelicia and her four surviving children traveled to Europe. While there, she continued amassing her large art collection, including five major marble statues by the most important American sculptors who were working in Rome. These included works by Randolph Rogers, William Henry Rinehart, Joseph Mozier, and Chauncey Ives. Four of these pieces remain in the mansion today. In France, Adelicia was presented at the Court of Emperor Louis Napoleon and his wife Empress Eug√©nie. Months before her death, Adelicia sold Belmont and the surrounding land to Lewis T. Baxter for around $54,000. It was adapted and in 1890 opened as a women's academy and junior college. The school merged with Ward's Seminary in 1913 and was renamed Ward- Belmont. The Tennessee Baptist Convention purchased the school in 1951, and developed a four-year, coeducational college, Belmont College. It was developed as a university offering graduate programs and, in 2007, Belmont University separated from the Tennessee Baptist Convention. Today the mansion is owned by the Belmont Mansion Association and Belmont University. It is operated and preserved by the Belmont Mansion Association. Gilt frame mirrors hang over marble mantels, reflecting the elaborate gasoliers and elegantly furnished parlors. Much of the original Venetian glass still adorns the windows, doors, and transoms of Belmont. The Grand Salon is considered by architectural historians to be the most elaborate domestic interior built in antebellum Tennessee. Now maintained as part of the University campus, the gardens contain five cast iron gazebos. The water tower remains on the grounds and today serves as a Bell Tower for Belmont University. Many notable visitors to the home include Mrs. James K. Polk, William Walker, Agust√≠n de Iturbide, Dwight L. Moody, Thomas Huxley, and Octavia Walton Le Vert.

It was named after the Cr√©teil Abbey, as most gatherings took place in that suburb of Paris.Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, a Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 History In 1905 and early 1906 a group of young artists and poets holding meetings at various locations found that society, the way it was organized, did not take into consideration an environment needed for creative expression, nor the goals it proposed.Paul √Üschimann (Aeschimann), La Po√©sie, Le Groupe de l'Abbaye, Vingt-cinq ans de litt√©rature fran√ßaise : tableau de la vie litt√©raire de 1897 √† 1920. Tome 1, 1925, p. 24. Biblioth√®que nationale de France Founded officially in the autumn of 1906 by the painter Albert Gleizes, and the poets , , Alexandre Mercereau and Charles Vildrac, L'Abbaye de Cr√©teil was a phalanst√®re, a utopian community.Barzun, Henri-Martin, L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synth√®se Po√©tique Moderne, Figui√®re, 1912 The movement drew its inspiration from the Abbaye de Th√©l√®me, a fictional creation by Rabelais in his novel Gargantua. It was closed down by its members early in 1908. Georges Duhamel and Vildrac settled in Cr√©teil, just to the southeast of Paris, in a house in a park-like setting along the Marne River. Their aim was to establish a place of freedom and friendship favourable for artistic and literary creativity. Henri-Martin Barzun (father of the historian and cultural critic Jacques Barzun) was a financial contributor to his friends at the Abbaye de Cr√©teil. > In an unpublished part of his Souvenirs Gleizes wrote that an initial idea > for the Abbaye of Cr√©teil was to escape from corrupt Western civilization to > the simplicity of life in the South Seas, as he then believed Gauguin had > done. (Robbins, 1964) The group tried to create a publishing house that would bring in sufficient income to support the Abbaye. The typographer , a friend of Albert Gleizes, furnished the printing press. From January 1907 through January 1908, some twenty books were published by the Abbaye. Barzun, more sophisticated than the other idealists of the Abbaye, introduced Gleizes to the specific history of Utopian socialism. Though Gleizes did not enter the Abbaye with a specific program in mind. The art historian Daniel Robbins is responsible for laying out the filiation between the Paul Fort's Vers et Prose, the Abbaye, post- Symbolist writers and politically engaged aesthetic thinking that would lead Gleizes to Cubism. Robbin's pioneering work brought the history of the Abbaye to an Anglo-American readership. He characterized their endeavors as a 'search for a synthetic modern art' that gave expression to social ideas.David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Manchester University Press, 2004 In his 1964 Guggenheim essay on Gleizes, Robbins developed these notions and summarized them as: > A synthetic view of the universe, presenting the remarkable phenomena of > time and space, multiplicity and diversity, at once was his painted > equivalent to the ideals which were verbally realized in the Abbaye poetry. > (Robbins, 1964) Invitation for the 2nd exhibition of l'Abbaye as an art collective at rue du Moulin, Cr√©teil, around 1907-08 Many artists visited the community and participated in its project, including the poet Pierre Jean Jouve; the musician ; the illustrator ; the painter ; , who had translated American poet Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass into French; and the writer Jules Romains, founder of unanimism. The fame of the Abbaye circulated even in Moscow, attracting many artists along the way. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi were visitors there and young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend Cubism), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux are some of the artists who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye group, in principle supporting themselves through the communal work of publishing, were supported by many Symbolists. Yet its members soon began to break with the art forms practiced by the respected older generation. Like many Symbolists, the Abbaye artists \\"scorned the structure of a bourgeois world and sought to substitute a communal society\\", writes Robbins, \\"but they did not reject the themes of modern life in favor of the Symbolist focus on single elements and internal, individual images\\". They wished instead \\"to create an epic and heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory\\", Robbins continues, \\"an art dealing with the relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, even, ultimately, the city itself\\". The intentions of the Abbaye were vast and would ultimately remain unfulfilled. Their goal, like that of the Symbolists before them, was equivalent to an escape from reality. \\"Yet there were important distinctions\\", write Robbins, \\"for the Abbaye intention to create a total future a priori ruled out the Symbolist technique of creating solely from an aesthetic or a closed ideal\\". The Abbaye attracted much interest but little revenue and its young members found themselves forced to close their beloved Abbaye on January 28, 1908. Its publishing house survived for a while and the friends continued to gather every month for a d√Æner des copains (in French, \\"dinner of pals\\").Christian S√©n√©chal, L' abbaye de Cr√©teil.

The swingletree is the triangular piece in the foreground; the traces are the leather straps leading forward from this. (Swingletrees are more commonly a simple bar, not a triangle.) A swingletree (British Isles) or singletree (North America) is a wooden or metal bar used to balance the pull of a draught horse or other draught animal when pulling a vehicle. It is a kind of whippletree, and the term is also used sometimes for other whippletrees. It is a horizontal bar, attached or suspended in the middle, and able to hinge fore-and-aft in a horizontal plane. The traces (the straps by which the animal pulls) attach to its ends, and the vehicle is pulled from its middle. The centre of the swingletree may be bolted directly to the body of the vehicle, this bolt pulling the vehicle along. Alternatively it may hang loosely by a chain or strap from the body of the vehicle, and in this case the pull is taken by chains from the centre of the bar to the ends of the axle. The action of a swingletree is to balance the pull from alternate shoulders as the animal walks. It is used especially when the animal is in a breastcollar harness, because this can easily rub the shoulders if the pull is uneven. It is needed less for an animal in a horse collar, as the pull does not pass over the shoulders in the same way. For this reason heavier vehicles may have no swingletree, as they are normally pulled with a horse collar.

The book describes a year that the author said he spent trying to follow all the rules and guidelines he could find in the Bible, which turned out to be more than 700. Summary In the book, Jacobs discusses biblical rules, both the obscure and the well-known, and tries to follow them as literally as possible. He even attempts to stone an adulterer and to offer animal sacrifice. He also goes to visit numerous religious groups in order to show their particular views on the Bible, as well as their methods of worship.

It was designed by structural engineer C.A.P. Turner and built by the American Bridge Company from 1910 to 1911. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its national significance in the themes of engineering and transportation. It was nominated for its exceptional dimensions, beauty, innovative engineering techniques, and importance to transportation between Minnesota and Wisconsin. History The bridge was the second bridge on a Wisconsin Central Railway line that connected Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, with Minneapolis, Minnesota. The line was originally built in 1884. The crossing of the St. Croix River was difficult for the railway, since the original bridge across the river was very low and trains had to contend with a steep grade on either side of the river. This made it necessary to use helper engines and to make trains shorter. In 1909 the Wisconsin Central Railway built a higher bridge over the river. The bridge is above the river and long, with five steel arches towering above the river. The Wisconsin Central Railway was leased by the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway in 1909. In 1961 the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway, Wisconsin Central Railway and the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway merged to form the Soo Line Railroad. After the Soo Line Railroad acquired the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, they shifted Chicago‚ÄìMinneapolis traffic to that railroad's superior mainline. In 1987 the bridge and much of the Soo Line's track in Wisconsin became part of the new Wisconsin Central Ltd. The Wisconsin Central was acquired by Canadian National Railway on January 30, 2001.

Background  Born in Sweden in 1947, Claes Fornell received a Doctorate of Economics in 1976 from Lund University, Sweden. He is The Donald C. Cook Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Business Administration at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. Professor Fornell has also been on the faculty of Duke University, Northwestern University, the Stockholm School of Economics and INSEAD. In 2009, at the 100-year anniversary of the Stockholm School of Economics, Fornell was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Economics. He also holds honorary professorships from Renmin University (2005) and Tianjin University (2007).  Research and writing  Fornell's research centers on the application of advanced quantitative methods for understanding how to obtain high financial returns and lower risk at the same time. It was the convergence of these interests that led Fornell, in 1994, to found the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) ‚Äì a monthly economic indicator of the quality of economic output, as experienced by the users of that output. ACSI is a predictor of consumer spending and economic growth at the macro level,Fornell, C., R.T. Rust and M.G.

It was launched on 14 October 1975 and served south Hampshire, West Sussex and the Isle of Wight initially until 1986, with various later reincarnations. It took its name from the famous historic ship HMS Victory which is preserved at Portsmouth. History =IBA franchise 1975-1986= Victory was one of the first 19 independent stations in the UK, all of which started broadcasting between 1973 and 1976. Its studios were based in Fratton, Portsmouth. Its FM transmitter, on 95.0 MHz, was at Fort Widley. Despite a power of only 0.2 kW, the signal reached Southampton and across the Isle of Wight quite well. The station also broadcast on Medium Wave 257m (1169 kHz, later moving to 1170 kHz) from Farlington Marshes with a power of 0.2 kW. Victory had three managing directors throughout its life ‚Äì Guy Paine, John Russell, and finally Bruce Jenkins. Housed in St Mary's Institute in Portsmouth's Fratton Road, its address was PO Box 257, Portsmouth PO1 5RT. For most of its life, Victory transmitted from 6 am to 1 am Mondays‚ÄìFridays, 6 am to 2 am Saturdays and 7 am to midnight on Sundays. This increased to 24-hour broadcasting from the start of the Falklands Conflict. Newsreader Penny Guy broadcast news of the first UK warship casualty‚Äîthe sinking of HMS Sheffield. Listeners were unaware her fianc√© Derek was aboard the vessel and she had no idea if he was alive or dead. (He survived and they wed shortly afterwards.) In 1985, the Independent Broadcasting Authority failed to renew the station's licence and it ceased broadcasting on 28 June 1986 at 12 pm, after 10 years and around 257 days on air, despite a local campaign to save it. Fratton Road in Portsmouth was jammed solid with traffic, drivers blaring their horns in tribute as the airwaves fell silent for the last time. Victory was the first ILR station to lose its franchise (although two others, Centre Radio and Gwent Broadcasting, went off air after going bankrupt). The station was replaced by Ocean Sound which was given a licence for a larger coverage area including Southampton. =Victory FM and Radio Victory 1994-1999= The name Victory, as a radio station for the Portsmouth area, was re-invented in 1994 to mark the city's 800th birthday and the 50th anniversary of D-Day (the city was the world's focus for this, hosting many events, including a dinner for world leaders in the Guildhall). Victory FM was set up by Mark Samways with the help of Kevin Huffer. Alex Bentley, the city's Lord Mayor during the set-up period, was most encouraging and helped by arranging for the council to provide space for the studios in the civic offices for a peppercorn rent. This first outing for the new service acquired a 28-day broadcast licence, called Restricted Service Licence (RSL), from the Radio Authority. It returned to the air twice more as Victory FM ‚Äî over the Christmas period of 1994 and again in 1995 to mark VE Day's 50th anniversary. The studios for this period were located in the Anchor House, North End and were loaned by the owners the Bradford and Bingley Building Society. The building had been empty since the Hampshire Building Society closed for business. The name was kept alive by predominantly the same team, broadcasting from a studios in Twyford Avenue, Stamshaw, this time broadcasting as Radio Victory on cable TV and with occasional temporary FM licences for special occasions, such as their own launch on cable at Christmas 1995 and to cover the Special Olympics. A total of six 28-day RSL FM broadcasts were made from 1994 to 1998. = Victory FM, Victory 107.4 and 107.4 The Quay 1999 - 2010 = When Greater Portsmouth was re-issued with its own ILR franchise, Radio Victory won the bid. It returned to the airwaves on 19 September 1999 as Victory FM on 107.4 FM. The station was acquired by TLRC at the end of 1999, and 2000 saw a massive change of personnel. It would seem that, without the key members who took the station from 28-day RSL to full-time FM licence, it was unable to compete in the RAJAR ratings against now established local rivals like Ocean FM and Wave 105. The station later relaunched as Victory 107.4 and 107.4 The Quay, allying itself closely to Portsmouth Football Club (PFC) who from Autumn of 2009 became the sole owners. During 2010 PFC sold the station to Celador's radio arm and the frequency became part of a regional station called The Breeze on 4 July 2010. The local studios in Twyford Avenue used since 1999 were closed. =Registration of trade mark 2014= In November 2014 Independent Local Radio Limited, a company with no previous connection to the name, registered the trademark Radio Victory Intellectual Property Office : Trade mark number UK00003082908 along with a number of other names of former UK local radio stations. Intellectual Property Office : Search for Trade Mark by Owner In early 2015 Independent Local Radio Limited launched crowdfunding bid \\"to raise ¬£25,000 to cover the cost of licences\\" The News: Could Portsmouth's Radio Victory make a comeback?, 11th March 2016 to launch Radio Victory again, this campaign closed only having raised ¬£571 Indiegogo: Unique local radio station for Portsmouth. On Air One of Victory's longest running shows was the Victory Roll, its own top-40 chart show aired on Saturday evenings until all ILR stations started simulcasting the Network Chart from Capital Radio. The Victory Roll (presented by Tony Power) was compiled from record sales at the Co-op record department in Fratton Road. The stations's first catchphrase was \\"everything that touches you\\". Presenters included Nino Firetto. The initial Victory FM catchphrases were \\"enjoy the moment\\", \\"from the heart of the city\\", and sometimes \\"to greater Portsmouth.\\" Broadcasters on the relaunched Radio Victory 107.4 in 1999 included Boy George, who also presented on the cable service.

Manufactured about 1896 for the 1904 St. Louis ExpositionWaymarking.com - Dentzel Carousel by the Dentzel Carousel Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the carousel was sold and shipped to Meridian. Highland Park Dentzel Carousel has been in operation since 1909 and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. It is the only remaining two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in the world. Its closest contemporaries both are held in Indiana. The Children's Museum carousel, also called The Carousel of Wishes and Dreams in Indianapolis, was probably manufactured pre-1900. It is not a pure Dentzel product, though; much of the original carousel has been modified from its original design. In Logansport, the Spencer Park Dentzel Carousel has been partially restored. It is dated between 1900 and 1903, although it may predate 1900 as well. The Carousel Inside view of carouselOriginal oil paintings of museum quality adorn the top crown of the carousel. The carousel is approximately in diameter, smaller than the time's standard 2-abreast ‚Äî in diameter, with 28 animals, two-abreast, and 2 chariots, providing seating for 36 people. All 28 animals on the carousel, including a lion, a tiger, 2 deer, 2 antelope, 2 giraffes, and 20 horses, are meticulously hand-carved of brass and poplar wood and have been recently restored to their original beauty. Meridian's Dentzel Carousel arrived in the city in 1909 and has since occupied the same location in Highland Park. Its house, also a National Historic Landmark, is the only remaining original carousel building built from a Dentzel blueprint. The carousel building was closed from 1983 to 1984 for major restoration, performed by Ralph E. Young Contractor, Inc. The carousel animals were removed and placed in various local institutions while funds were raised. From 1984 to 1995, the animals, chariots, and canvas oil paintings of the carousel were meticulously restored to their original beauty. Colors and designs were documented with careful color matching, tracing of designs, working drawings, and photographs showing where colors and designs originally occurred. The restoration was done by Rosa Ragan of Raleigh, N.C., one of the foremost restoration specialists in the U.S. The building Built from a Dentzel blueprint, the carousel's shelter building is a rectangular building approximately with board and batten siding. The exterior of the building is distinctive in appearance with a low, square, main block and a central section of octagonal roof with clerestory light windows. The clerestory is about in diameter and lights the interior. Inside the building, the original mosaic tile floor with a large snowflake pattern in green, yellow, terracotta, and white is intact. The carousel house has recently (1983‚Äì84) been restored, using a combination of city funds via private donations from \\"Friends of the Carousel,\\" grants, fund-raisers, city budgeted money, and a small National Park Service grant. Dentzel Carousels The Dentzels have been credited with essentially jump-starting the carousel industry in America. The family's work has been praised for the artistry of its carving and even described as \\"the finest built.\\" This characterization especially applies to their work up to 1910.Dentzel Carousel History Some Dentzels of the time were as large as in diameter carrying up to 72 animals and four chariots and contained animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, goats, pigs, donkeys, kangaroos, giraffes, lions, tigers, deer, buffaloes, ostriches, and more. Gustav A. Dentzel, a young German immigrant, began building carousels in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1864. It is commonly believed that several parts for his first American carousel were imported from his father, Michael Dentzel, who manufactured carousels in Kreuznach, in present-day Germany. Gustav continued to construct and sell carousels in America until his death in 1908 in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Gustav's two sons, William H. Dentzel and Edward P. Dentzel, continued their father's craft after his death, keeping the business running in Philadelphia until 1928, when William died. Edward continued the business for a short while in California, but quickly gave up the craft after the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression to build homes in Beverly Hills, CA. In the early 1970s, Edward's son, William H. Dentzel II, developed and produced a line of children's carousels finished in traditional Dentzel style with mirrors, artwork, lights and band organ music. He continued working in his grandfather's and father's footsteps until his death in 1991. William H. Dentzel III, William II's son, and his three children, Zaryn, Sophia, and Noah, follow in the family tradition. David M. Dentzel, William III's younger brother, has also carved several large horses and menagerie animals. A Dentzel carousel from the closed Woodland Park is installed at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park inside the new home of the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia which opened in October 2008.

However, this match uses real people on the chess board. When the match starts, the King keeps on losing his pawns and begins to get upset. This is because of his \\"loyal\\" chancellor who works for the King of Khitan behind people's back. On the other hand, Xuƒì Y√≠pi√†o, a lover and expert of Chinese chess is watching the match outside the palace, while observing the match. he started to sigh and saying out loud that the King is an idiot. At the nearly end of the match, there are only two pawns left, the chariot and the minister of the red. The chariot, Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn is the most well-trained one out of the others, he managed to defeat a few black pawns. Seeing this, the chancellor starts to get annoyed, planning to kill him if he doesn't die in this match. The chariot of the blacks started to fight with him and the tired Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn cannot stand the attacks and so he falls off his chariot. The black chariot, takes this chance and tries to kill him but Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn manages to block some of his attacks although at the end, he loses his right arm after being run over by the black chariot's wheel while he attempts to dodge an attack. The pawn is taken down on the chessboard outside the palace and the people starts to get worried as they were excited when a few black pawns were taken down off the board. Y√® Y√®xƒ´n the daughter of the general of the red pawns who is a close friend of Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn gets more worried than any others. Even after losing his arm, yu√® hu√°i xiƒÅn attempts to protect the general. Just before the black chariot gives the last attack to the minister, the King of China stops the match by admitting that he has lost. And the King of Khitan says that next time, whoever loses the match must call the winner father. Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn and the general are taken away to the doctor in the palace. However, the chancellor thinks of a plan to kill them both. He uses the name of the King behind his back that they are to be planked till their death and their families kicked out of the city. Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn manages to live where the general doesn't, Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn is then thrown into pigpen, leaving him to die. Xuƒì Y√≠pi√†o passes by the pigpen and notices the blood- soaked Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn. He carries Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn home to his blind mother. Y√® Y√®xƒ´n and her mother are being forced out of the city; Y√® Y√®xƒ´n escapes the chancellor's son but her mother is killed in the attempt to safe her daughter. Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn becomes friend with Xuƒì Y√≠pi√†o and the adventure begins. After meeting Y√® Y√®xƒ´n, Xuƒì Y√≠pi√†o starts to like her. After knowing that Yu√® Hu√°ixiƒÅn still lives, the chancellor orders his daughter, Lƒõng Y√†n to kill him. Lƒõng Y√†n orders the killer, BƒÅ L√©iw«î and Lƒõng Y√†n instead she pays him and stands and watches.

It is also referred to as an equalizer, leader bar, or double tree. It consists of a bar pivoted at or near the centre, with force applied from one direction to the pivot and from the other direction to the tips. Several whippletrees may be used in series to distribute the force further, such as to simulate pressure over an area as when applying loading to test airplane wings. Whippletrees may be used either in compression or tension. They were also used for subtraction and addition calculations in mechanical computers. Tension whippletrees are used in artful hung mobiles, such as those by artist Alexander Calder. Draught whippletrees A single horse ploughing - the whippletree is the horizontal wooden bar just in front of the plough A set of whippletrees for a three- animal team Whippletrees are used in tension to distribute forces from a point load to the traces of draught animals (the traces are the chains or straps on each side of the harness, on which the animal pulls). For these, the whippletree consists of a loose horizontal bar between the draught animal and its load. The centre of the bar is connected to the load, and the traces attach to its ends. Whippletrees are used especially when pulling a dragged load such as a plough, harrow, log or canal boat or for pulling a vehicle (by the leaders in a team with more than one row of animals). A swingletree, or singletree, is a special kind of whippletree used for a horse-drawn vehicle. The term swingletree is sometimes used for draught whippletrees. A whippletree balances the pull from each side of the animal, preventing the load from tugging alternately on each side. It also keeps a point load from pulling the traces in onto the sides of the animal. If several animals are used abreast, further whippletrees may be used behind the first. Thus, with two animals, each has its own whippletree, and a further one balances the loads from their two whippletrees‚Äîan arrangement sometimes known as a double-tree, or for the leaders in a larger team, leader-bars. With three or more animals abreast, even more whippletrees are needed; some may be made asymmetrical to balance odd numbers of animals. Multiple whippletrees balance the pulls from the different animals, ensuring that each takes an equal share of the work. Other agricultural whippletrees Whippletrees are also used in modern agriculture‚Äîfor example, to link several ganged agricultural implements such as harrows, mowers or rollers to a tractor. This combines several small loads into a single load at the tractor hitch (the reverse of the use for draught animals). Windshield (windscreen) wipers windscreen wiper uses whippletrees to distribute the force of the wiper arm evenly across the blade. A series of whippletrees is used in compression in a standard windshield wiper to distribute the point force of the sprung wiper arm evenly along the wiper blade. Telescopes Some designs for large telescopes use whippletreesA Short History of Armagh Observatory. to support the optical elements. The tree provides distributed mechanical support, reducing localised mechanical deflections, which in turn reduces optical distortion.see photo of first mirror cell to use whippletree levers. Unlike the applications described above, which are two-dimensional, the whippletrees in telescope mirror support cells are three-dimensional designs,Mechanical design of the 110 cm Cruxis Telescope Mirror and mirror support cell. since the tree must support multiple points over an area. Mechanical analogue computers Linkage-type mechanical analog computers use whippletree linkages to add and subtract quantities represented by straight-line motions.Svoboda, Anton√≠n, Computing Mechanisms and Linkages, M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Series, New York, 1948, McGraw-Hill Book Company (also New York, Dover Publications, 1965) Section 2-6, Fig 2-12, p 37. The illustration here of whippletrees for a three-animal team is very similar to a group of linkage adders and subtracters: \\"load\\" is the equivalent of the output sum/difference of the individual inputs. Inside the computer, cylinders on the knob shafts have thin metal tapes wrapped around them to convert rotary to linear motion. One widely used application was in the IBM Selectric typewriter (and the IBM 2741 derived from it), where the linkages summed binary mechanical inputs to rotate and tilt the type ball. This type of computing method was also used for naval gunnery, such as the MK 56 Gun Fire Control System and sonar fire-control systems.

He graduated from the Minas Gerais Military School as a Brazilian Army lieutenant in 1921. Although he was sympathetic to the rebellion of young officers called Movimento Tenentista ('Lieutenants' Movement') of 1922, he did not take part. In 1930 he joined the national rebellion against the Constitutional Brazilian government that began when the candidate who lost the 1930 election for president, Get√∫lio Vargas, alleged fraud and decided to take power by force. Jo√£o Punaro Bley joined the lines of the rebel Colonel Ot√°vio Campos do Amaral and took part on the capture of Vit√≥ria (capital city of the state of Esp√≠rito Santo). As Oct√°vio Campos do Amaral marched towards Rio de Janeiro, Jo√£o Punaro Bley occupied the office of that state as part of a governing junta also formed by Jo√£o Manuel de Carvalho and Afonso Correia L√≠rio. This governing Junta lasted for a few days, whereupon on November 22, 1930 Jo√£o Punaro Bley was appointed Federal Interventor in Espirito Santo for an undetermined time by the newly installed de facto president of Brazil, Get√∫lio Vargas. In 1934, following the re- constitutionalization of Brazil, Jo√£o Punaro Bley was elected legal governor for the 1935-1939 term (he was also the first chief of the executive power of Espirito Santo to take the title of governor instead of president). However, he was given Federal powers once again in 1937 and remained in office until 1943. When Bley took office, the state of Espirito Santo was in a poor economic situation, as the Wall Street Crash in 1929 directly affected the monoculture of coffee, the main export. In order to lower coffee prices in the consumer markets, and to force the farmers to diversify the state's agriculture, Bley sent troops to invade the farms and to uproot and burn as much coffee plants as possible. Against all odds, the bad economic situation of the state was quickly overcome and all the debts of the state were paid. Jo√£o Punaro Bley wanted to eliminate the political influence of the big landowner farmers (like the family Monteiro) over the state. First, he encouraged the internal peasant migration towards the underpopulated regions in the north of the state, which depleted the coffee plantations of workers; then Bley boosted the industrialization of the state and the development of urban business activities. Both decisions demanded a large investment to improve the state's infrastructure (power, drinking water, sewage, roads and railroads to link the south and the north of the state, as well to connect the state to the rest of the country). Also, against the vindictive landowner's mobs of gunmen (\\"jagun√ßos\\" as they were known), Bley invested in creating a regular professional state police and built the state's headquarters of Maruipe and new, and more secure, state jails. Bley created the first university of Espirito Santo, which initially offered courses in Odontology, Law and Pharmacy. It was also on Bley's time in office that the mining company Vale do Rio Doce (still owned by the Brazilian government) started construction of a railway linking the iron mining fields in Minas Gerais to the port of Vit√≥ria, from where the iron was distributed to other states or exported overseas. Jo√£o Punaro Bley resigned from office on 21 January 1943. His powers were transferred to his substitute, Jones dos Santos Neves. Jo√£o Punaro Bley worked as commerce director at the Vale do Rio Doce until 1947, then he resumed his military career, from which he retired in 1962.

Home to a museum honoring Jimmie Rodgers, a Meridian native, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The park is also home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building, a National Historic Landmark manufactured around 1896 by Gustav Dentzel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The historic carousel is the only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie still in existence. History The history of Highland Park begins in the late 19th century when the area was used as the Meridian Fair and Livestock Exposition.City of Meridian, MS ‚Äì Historic Neighborhoods The organization, which was influenced by World's fairs such as the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and Atlanta's International Cotton Exposition in 1895, was founded in 1904 by big names in Meridian such as Israel Marks, the Threefoot brothers, and the Rothenbergs. They acquired land in west Meridian but never made any plans of what to do with it. When the Fair and Exposition Corporation dissolved in 1906, ownership of the land was transferred to a non-profit trust. After a city Park Association was formed in 1908, the association was tasked with assembling property and developing initial plans for the park. Israel A Marks (1913), by Allen George NewmanAnnals of Iowa, vol. 11, no. 2 (July 1913), Iowa State University, p. 231. Historic Park sign At the time Highland Park was designed, there was a national trend for streetcar pleasure parks, and electric railway companies wanted to increase their operations by owning or investing in these parks. The Meridian Light and Railway Company followed the national trend, building a rail line beginning at 8th Street and following 34th Avenue until it turned west between 19th and 20th Streets and continuing west into Highland Park. The platform for the streetcar line was located in the northeast corner of the park at the main entrance. A promenade connected the platform with a small pool, a carousel house, a large loveseat, a bronze statue honoring Israel Marks, and a gazebo. A sidewalk extended from the promenade to a dance pavilion, and another sidewalk connected the gazebo with a bandstand. South of this group was a lagoon, alligator pond, footbridge, and greenhouse. In the western section of the park, there were two picnic shelters, a small toilet facility, and a terraced amphitheater. The northern part of the park was originally meant for pedestrians while the southern part was reserved for those with horses. A downtown monument honoring Frank M. Zehler, a fireman who died on duty in 1901, was relocated to the park in the 1920s from its original location at the intersection of 23rd Avenue and 4th Street in downtown Meridian. In the 1930s, two swimming pools were built on the site of the former dance pavilion, a one-story commercial building was added in the northwest corner of the park, and an arboretum was added by the amphitheater. The pathways in the park were paved in the 1940s, allowing vehicles to travel through the area. A small fighter jet was located in the park between the pools and the promenade in 1972. Also, a Parks and Recreation office, a museum honoring Jimmie Rodgers, a steam locomotive and caboose, children's playground equipment, and the Frank Cochran Center have been added since. Of the original features, all remain except the dance pavilion and greenhouse. Dentzel carousel Historic Dentzel Carousel Highland Park Dentzel Carousel The Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building was manufactured about 1896 for the 1904 St. Louis ExpositionWaymarking.com ‚Äì Dentzel Carousel by Gustav Dentzel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Meridian bought the carousel in 1909 and installed it in its house in the park. It is the only remaining two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in the world. As such, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Its house, also in the National Historic Landmark listing, is the only remaining original carousel building built from a Dentzel blueprint. While the carousel building was closed from 1983 to 1984 for major restoration, the carousel animals were removed and placed in various local institutions while funds were raised. From 1984 to 1995, the animals, chariots, and canvas oil paintings of the carousel were restored to their original appearance. The restoration was done by Rosa Ragan of Raleigh, North Carolina, one of the foremost restoration specialists in the country. Jimmie Rodgers museum The park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum honoring the Meridian-born country legend and displaying the original guitar of the so-called \\"Singing Brakeman,\\" along with other memorabilia of his life and career and various railroading equipment from the steam engine era ‚Äì Meridian's \\"golden age\\". In addition to the museum building itself, which was built in 1976, outside memorials honor the country star, and a vintage steam locomotive is displayed on a small section of railroad track, symbolizing Meridian's strong ties to railroading history. The locomotive is a 1917 Baldwin steam locomotive from the Susquehanna and New York Railroad line. It was later used by the Meridian and Bigbee railroad, who donated it to the city in 1953 as a memorial to all deceased railroaders. The locomotive was moved to the park in 1970. Arts in the Park Ducks in the park The park hosted the annual Arts in the Park festival from the festival's premiere in 1971 until 2006, when the Meridian Council of Arts decided to move the festival to Bonita Lakes, another location in Meridian.Arts in the Park In 2009 the festival was combined with the Threefoot Arts Festival and moved to downtown Meridian to form the Threefoot Festival.Meridian Star ‚Äì Arts festival draws a big crowd Arts in the Park, held on the first Saturday in April, provides a multi-discipline venue for artists, craftsmen, musicians and performers. Local dance groups, martial arts groups, drama groups, gospel- drama groups, gospel praise dance teams, singers, bands and choral groups perform their art for crowds of people on two separate entertainment stages. The festival features a juried art competition and show as well as a non- competition craft area. Arts in the Park acts as a revenue source for non- profit groups as well as a showcase for the Arts. In general the non-profit groups that take part in Arts in the Park are art organizations, local churches, and various community wide charitable organizations.Meridian Council of the Arts  See also  * List of music museums References External links * Highland Park ‚Äì City of Meridian * Dentzel Carousel ‚Äì City of Meridian * Jimmie Rodgers Museum Category:Meridian, Mississippi Category:Parks in Mississippi Category:Protected areas of Lauderdale County, Mississippi Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Mississippi Category:Mississippi Landmarks Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lauderdale County, Mississippi Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Mississippi Category:Tourist attractions in Meridian, Mississippi Category:1909 establishments in Mississippi ","title":"Highland Park (Meridian, Mississippi)"},{"id":"13862851","text":"Andrew \\"Andy\\" Crosby (born 5 November 1965 in Bella Coola, British Columbia) is a retired rower from Canada.

In the game, players must face an alien threat that humanity had previously banished. The game mixes on-foot and mid-air combat. It was released worldwide in January 2010. A Games for Windows ‚Äì Live version of Dark Void was also released on April 21, 2010. Gameplay The games make use of a unique \\"vertical cover system\\", as well as a standard cover system. The game includes a hover pack, and later, a jetpack, allowing for a quick transition between traditional shooter gameplay and flight. Everything unlocked in the first play through is transferred over to any new play throughs. Upgrades are purchased using Tech points through a shop at the start of every level before gameplay begins. Tech points are collected from defeated enemies and are hidden throughout the level. Plot The game's story takes place before World War II and centers around a cargo pilot named William Augustus Grey (voiced by Nolan North) who is teleported to another world while flying through the Bermuda Triangle. In this world, known as the 'Void', Will encounters an alien race as well as other humans, which are known as the Watchers and the Survivors respectively. Will reluctantly joins the Survivors, who are engaged in a feud with the alien race, to satisfy his desire to return to Earth. While aiding the Survivors, Will discovers that the Void is a middle ground that connects both the Watchers' homeworld and Earth. It also becomes apparent that the Watchers are supplying the Axis powers with various wartime provisions for reasons unknown. With the help of Nikola Tesla, Will uses retrofitted Watcher technology to combat the Watchers and eventually find a way to escape the Void. Music Bear McCreary, making his video game score debut, composed the score to Dark Void. He recorded the score with a 63-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Eastwood Scoring Stage. Spin-off A spin-off title for DSiWare called Dark Void Zero was released in North America on January 18, 2010 and in the PAL region on March 5, 2010. Setting it apart from the next-gen version, the game was designed as a retro title featuring 8-bit graphics and sound, with 2D gameplay in the same vein as the Metroid games. To promote the game, a history of the game was created in which it was a title Capcom was developing to be a breakthrough NES property in the late 80s, but was shelved with the discontinuation of the PlayChoice-10 and the coming of the SNES. This history also appears in-game during the introduction. Additionally, before starting the game, players must use the DSi microphone to blow the cartridge's \\"contacts\\", a homage to the age-old method of getting non-working NES games to play. Capcom manager Seth Killian said Dark Void Zero started development after finishing the pre-release copy of Dark Void, inspired by the 8-bit music McCreary provided for the ending credits. Dark Void Zero was also released on the iPhone and Windows platforms on April 12, 2010. Both versions have an all-new secret ending. The Steam version has an additional ending (for a total of three possible endings), Steam Achievements, online leaderboards, and a SecuROM 5 machine activation limit. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said, \\"Dark Void is one of those games you'll play, beat, and forget ever existed.\\" Game Informer said that \\"the shining strengths of the game are buried underneath a thick layer of rust that only the thirstiest of air-junkies should bother chipping through.\\" GameZone's Louis Bedigian said of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, \\"The generic Gears of War-style shooting is forgivable. But the countless technical problems all but destroy a game that had the potential to be something truly special. Dark Void can be summed up in just six words: so much potential, so much disappointment.\\" Hardcore Gamer praised the innovative jet pack but stated that the game \\"winds up being less than the sum of its parts,\\" and that Dark Void is \\"not something you need to have in your collection.\\" Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation noted that Dark Void was the game that had disappointed him most in his review career - not because it was bad, but rather because it was ambitious, and in stretches, very engrossing, innovative and fun, but in the end felt both too short and too unfinished, as if the developers had run out of money or time or will. Edge gave the Xbox 360 version a score of six out of ten and said, \\"Somehow, Dark Void just about rises above its faults, but it's hardly at risk of flying too close to the sun.\\" 411Mania gave the PS3 version a score of 5.2 out of 10 and said, \\"It is sad to say but there really isn't much of a fun factor here. If you are a fan of getting as much trophies as possible, then I can see some fun in this game. There are plenty of trophies to be earned here and a lot of them are very easy to get. I think for people enjoy flying simulators or any type of flying game for that matter might enjoy this a bit more than I did. The story is a bit too spotty, the characters don't seem very important and the game is just very forgettable after you beat it.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version five out of ten and called it \\"a game we wanted to like more than we did. Its retro sci-fi concept is so appealing it initially makes it tempting to excuse some of the game's rougher edges. In the end, however, no amount of nostalgia can absolve the game of its ropy gameplay, patchy plot, substandard production, generic (and sometimes poor) level design and thin content; the campaign takes around eight hours to complete and that's the only mode on offer.\\" Wired gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions four stars out of ten, saying, \\"Even though some stages (like the penultimate aerial battle) felt like they lasted forever and ever, Dark Void is a pretty short game with an anticlimactic ending that does little more than set up a sequel.\\" The A.V. Club gave the PS3 version a D and called it \\"an exercise in diminishing returns‚Äîwhat at first seems new and fun eventually becomes dully predictable, and having to mash buttons to secure your grip only adds to the snarling annoyances.\\" References External links  Category:2010 video games Category:Capcom franchises Category:Capcom games Category:Bermuda Triangle in fiction Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games about ancient astronauts Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Video games using PhysX ","title":"Dark Void"},{"id":"13862932","text":"Terrence Michael \\"Terry\\" Paul (born September 14, 1964 in Oakville, Ontario) is a retired rowing coxswain from Canada.

It became her breakthrough song and has since remained her signature song. Its widespread licensing in films as well as numerous official and unofficial cover versions (including a notable cover by of Montreal) has led to a sustained popularity for the song. Writing and inspiration The song combines low-fidelity, rumbling bass with snare drums from a Roland TR-909 to make a \\"clickity-clack\\" rhythm. Muted yelling sounds can be heard in the background. The song's lyrics established Peaches' reputation as a sex-positive feminist. She uses euphemisms to present a sexually aggressive image. The lyrics include references to \\"Call Me\\" by Blondie and The Pretenders' frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. The line \\"Stay in school, 'cause it's the best\\" alludes to Peaches' previous occupation as a teacher. Peaches' vocal performance was described as vampy, lustful, and insouciant. Her bold delivery holds \\"between self-empowerment and self- destruction.\\" Recording Peaches never recorded \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\" in a studio. The song is a live recording from the first time it was ever performed. Critical reception The Observer Music Monthly listed \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\" at 61 on its list of the best songs of the 2000s. Complex magazine named it the seventh greatest slutwave song of all time. Q listed it at #826 on their 1001 Best Songs Ever list. The Guardian included the song on its list of \\"1000 songs everyone must hear\\". Music videos Notably, there is no official music video for the song, and Peaches called upon fans to create videos and other performance art pieces which utilize it. One parody shows \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\" being performed by Miss Piggy. Another version, directed by Erik Huber, takes footage from The Andy Griffith Show and inserts a dancing woman. Impact and reuse Thom Yorke performing \\"15 Step\\", which was influenced by \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\". Thom Yorke cited \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\" as an inspiration in making \\"15 Step\\" for Radiohead's 2007 album In Rainbows. A nightclub in Brighton, England, takes its name from the song. Belgian group 2ManyDJs included the song on their 2002 album As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2. It appears on the album's visual mix, accompanied by clips of the Velvet Underground's banana design emerging from Peaches' groin from The Teaches of Peaches. British singer Bat for Lashes has performed a live cover version. On Gorgon City's 2014 album Sirens, Erik Hassle reinterprets the refrain for \\"FTPA\\", a song about casual sex. \\"Fuck the Pain Away\\" became a popular choice when film and TV soundtracks were in need of a catchy but objectionable song. It was used for a key scene in Sofia Coppola's 2003 film Lost in Translation. In the scene, Bill Murray's character glumly sits in a Japanese strip club as women pole dance to the song. It is used in the 2002 horror film My Little Eye, the 2006 reality film Jackass Number Two, the 2011 romantic comedy Getting That Girl, the 2011 action film Drive Angry, and the 2013 gross out film Wetlands, as well as being sung by Bollo in The Mighty Boosh Live. It also appeared in an episode of the thirteenth season of South Park, \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\". The 30 Rock episode \\"Future Husband\\" shows Tina Fey's character Liz Lemon using the song as a ringtone. The song also appeared in end credits of the True Blood season 6 episode of the same name. The song was also used in The Handmaid's Tale in a 2017 episode, \\"Nolite Te Bastardes Carborundorum\\", and in the Canadian show Letterkenny in a 2018 episode, \\"We Don't Fight at Weddings\\". The song was referenced and featured in Red Letter Media's review of Baby's Day Out, claiming that the film's German title translates to Fuck the Pain Away. The song itself plays over a montage toward the end of the review.

It was founded in 2004 by a team of software developers, typographers and font-industry veterans who had previously been involved in developing fonts used widely in computers, inkjet printers, phones and other digital technology devices. On December 8, 2010, Ascender Corp. was acquired by Monotype Imaging. Currently Ascender Corporation markets both directly to consumers with font packs and individual fonts, and to original equipment manufacturers and software developers with custom font-design and implementation services. A portion of the company‚Äôs work since its founding has been in extending font glyphs for international use and in the process of ‚Äúhinting,‚Äù whereby characters are optimized for screen viewing. Subsidiaries *Webtype.com: It is a joint venture by The Font Bureau, Inc. and Ascender Corporation. On August 17, 2010, The Font Bureau, Inc. and Ascender Corporation announced Webtype.com, a new venture to serve web designers and developers with publication-quality fonts to improve the typography and readability of websites.  Type Designers  Steve Matteson, one of Ascender‚Äôs founding partners and lead type designer, worked on the Arial and Times New Roman typefaces that Microsoft Corporation introduced in Windows 3.1 in 1992. These same fonts have been distributed in all subsequent versions of Microsoft Windows and recent versions of Mac OS. Since then Matteson has designed other fonts including Segoe, Microsoft‚Äôs current corporate branding font, Convection for the Xbox 360, and the Liberation fonts for Red Hat‚Äôs Linux Distribution. Some of Matteson‚Äôs other font designs include Andal√© Mono, Andy, Curlz and Endurance. Another founding partner of Ascender, Tom Rickner, specializes in the technical nuances of digital typography, the production of non-Latin scripts and TrueType font hinting. Rickner oversaw the development of the first TrueType fonts delivered in Apple Computer‚Äôs System 7 in 1991. Most recently Rickner was involved in the development of Microsoft‚Äôs ClearType font collection. He has also been involved in the design and production of many typefaces created for the digital environment including Georgia, Graphite, Meiryo, Nina, Tahoma, Tekton and Verdana.  Products  In the same year that Ascender was formed, it released its first typeface, Endurance, with the design goal of high readability in both print and on screen. Endurance's design follows the Swiss model of Grotesque sans serifs. Capital letters are less constricted in proportion than other popular Grotesques (Arial and Helvetica for instance). Terminals are shorter and counters are generally more open. The italics are designed and not algorithmically slanted. In 2005, Ascender announced that it entered into an agreement with Microsoft Corporation to distribute Microsoft fonts, including the Windows Core Fonts, the Microsoft Web Fonts and the many multilingual fonts currently supplied by Microsoft in its software products and operating systems. In that same year Ascender announced that it had a distribution agreement with IBM to provide a range of Japanese fonts as well as a distribution agreement with Bigelow & Holmes Type Foundry to distribute the Lucida family of fonts. Also in 2005, Steve Matteson designed the fonts for the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft. Ascender‚Äôs type designers and font software engineers created custom fonts tuned specifically for high-quality display on-screen in the Xbox user interface, as well as multilingual fonts to support the Xbox 360 branding and marketing around the world. At the end of 2005 Ascender announced its first OpenType Pro font, Pericles Pro. Pericles Pro is based on the work of Robert Foster who created the original designs for American Type Founders in 1934. Each Pericles Pro font includes 433 glyphs. This includes 12 stylistic alternates and 17 ligatures to mix and match with a full set of capitals, small capitals, superscript, subscript and petite small capital letters. In 2006 Ascender released numerous products for hardware and software developers including a font set that meets the EIA-708-B standard for Digital TV Closed Captioning (DTVCC), large Unicode compliant fonts and fonts for HD DVD authors and publishers designed to enhance the on-screen experience that is part of an HD DVD's Advanced Content. Also in 2006 Ascender introduced a software product for mobile phones ‚Äì the Ascender Personality Kit. This software combined ring tones, wallpaper backgrounds, themes and fonts into packaged sets that automated the process of acquiring and applying multiple components for users to personalize their Windows Mobile phone. In November, 2007 Ascender announced it had created the Droid font family for the Android handset platform.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/11/prweb566204.htm Droid font for Android platform In 2007 Ascender executed a license to distribute the Microsoft scalable font engine that supports hinting technology to enhance on- screen legibility. Ascender also created the Liberation fonts distributed by Red Hat. In the same year Ascender made the Microsoft ClearType Font Collection available to end users looking to utilize the fonts from the Microsoft Vista operating system on other platforms (including Mac, Unix and previous Windows versions). Research Ascender has conducted numerous typographic-related research projects including a study on the typefaces that appear on the front pages of America's top daily newspapers. This study identified the most popular typefaces, sources, and the pervasive use of custom fonts in newspaper design. Another Ascender study researched the free and shareware fonts that can be found on the most-popular Websites. The study analyzed more than 4500 TrueType fonts that can be downloaded by Macintosh, Windows and GNU/Linux users to determine their viability for use in linking downloadable fonts to web pages as part of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specification proposed by the W3C. The study found that out of the 4572 fonts tested, 4385 fonts (95.9%) failed one or more of six tests that were performed.

Joseph Norman Dolley (1860-1940) was the bank commissioner of State of Kansas who pushed for the passage of the first state securities laws, known as the blue-sky laws.GelberLaw: LAWRENCE R. GELBER: The GelberLaw Glossary at www.GelberLaw.net J.N. Dolley, as he was known, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, a son of Joseph Norman and Ellen (Broderick) Dolley. On October 13, 1887, he married Mary E. McClellan, of Pennsylvania. At the time of their marriage she was a resident of Maple Hill, Kansas. They had a daughter, Esther A. Dolley.Joseph Norman Dolley - KS- Cyclopedia - 1912 at skyways.lib.ks.us Dolley received a common school education, and, while young, went to sea with his father. He continued as a sailor until 1885. He then moved to Kansas, where he went into business as a country merchant and proprietor of a blacksmith shop. These were the earliest business enterprises of the town of Maple Hill, where Dolley was virtually the first settler and the founder of the town. Shortly thereafter Dolley became interested in banking. He went on to become the president of the Commercial National Bank of Alma, and vice-president of the Stockgrowers' State Bank of Maple Hill, generally known at the time as \\"Dolley's Bank.\\" Dolley appeared to be achievement oriented, and in addition to his banking positions was also president of the Mid-Kansas Milling Company of Alma, the Kansas Home Mutual Life Insurance Company of Topeka, the P. C. C. Oil & Gas Company of Chanute, the Maple Hill school board, and vice-president of the Wabaunsee County Telephone Company. The \\"Topeka Daily Capital\\" of Jan. 3, 1909, reported: \\"Joe Dolley hadn't been in Kansas long enough to get the seaweed out of his hair before he was in politics‚Ä¶. No stopping Dolley in Wabaunsee, where the farmers know him, trust him, believe in him and vote for him.\\" In 1902, Dolley was elected to represent his county in the lower branch of the state legislature. In 1904 he was elected to the state senate from the twenty-first district, composed of the counties of Wabaunsee, Riley and Geary. After four years in the senate he was again elected representative from Wabaunsee county, and was speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives in the 1909-1910 session.The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians: Dohlman to Donahower In 1910 and 1911 he was favorably mentioned by several Kansas newspapers as a candidate for governor. During the presidential campaign of 1908, Dolley was chairman of the Republican state central committee, and with a fund of less than $20,000 carried the state for the William Howard Taft electors by a plurality of over 37,000. However, four years later, Dolley painfully informed Taft that Kansas was going to Theodore Roosevelt. (New York Times February 12, 1912.) On, March 3, 1909, Governor Walter R. Stubbs appointed Dolley state bank commissioner, in which capacity Dolley served from April 1, 1909 through March 1, 1913.History of Commissioners at www.osbckansas.org As bank commissioner, Dolley became increasingly angry about fraudsters cheating banking customers out of their savings. The Saturday Evening Post of December 2, 1911 (Volume 184, Number 23) quoted him: > \\"Why, I had been in the banking business here in Kansas a good many years > before I became bank commissioner,\\" he explained when I asked him about the > genesis of the Blue Sky Law. \\"Every now and then I would hear of one of > these swindles ‚Äì that somebody had lost his money through buying stock in a > fake mine, or in a Central America plantation that was nine parts > imagination, or in some wonderful investment company that was going to pay > forty per cent dividends.

Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner at > www.securities.state.ks.us In 1911, as a result of Dolley's lobbying efforts, Kansas became the first state to enact a \\"comprehensive\\" securities law requiring registration of both securities and their salesmen. Dolley used the term \\"Blue Sky\\" in connection with promoting passage of the statute, and the term was used by those reporting on it. See \\"Joe Dolley Is After the Blue Sky Merchants\\", Topeka Capital-Journal, December 22, 1910. Dolley had complained about the \\"enormous amount of money the Kansas people are being swindled out of by these fakers and 'blue-sky' merchants.' \\": Letter from J. N. Dolley Dec. 16, 1910 reprinted in Brief for Appellees at 33, Merrick v. N. W- Halsey & Co., 242 US. 568 (1917) (No. 413), cited in J.R- Macey and G.P.

It was reportedly said that no assets backed up those securities‚Äînothing but the blue skies of Kansas. Dolley died, according to an obituary in the New York Times of that date, from injuries sustained when he was hit by a car while crossing the street. Further reading Lawrence R.

Named for Arthur's famed Round Table, the festivals generally involved jousts with blunted weapons, and often celebrated weddings or victories. In some cases participants dressed in the costume of such well-known knights as Lancelot, Tristan, and Palamedes.  History  The earliest Round Table was recorded in 1223, when the Crusader lord of Beirut held one in Cyprus to celebrate the knighting of his eldest sons. Round Tables were popular in various European countries through the rest of the Middle Ages and were at times very elaborate. =Round Tables in England= The \\"Winchester Round Table\\" Edward I held one on the occasion of his marriage, and one in 1284 to celebrate his conquest of Wales; and is recorded as sponsoring several as late as 1304. One artefact that has survived from this fashion in England is the \\"Winchester Round Table\\" in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. The timber of this table has been dated by dendrochronology to 1275, during Edward's reign,Channel 4 ‚Äì Time Team. though a royal provenance is not proven so far. The present \\"Winchester Round Table\\" was painted in 1522 by order of King Henry VIII. The places at the table are divided up with alternating green and white panels with the name of Arthurian knights written in gold. However it is King Henry VIII's portrait that is painted at King Arthur's place, and the Tudor red rose that adorns the table's centre. Edward III held a tournament and feast at Windsor in 1344 and built a huge round structure to house it. The details of its use are obscure. However, it is believed that he intended to found an order of knighthood named after the Round Table and modelled on the fellowship of King Arthur; in the event, in 1348, the order he established was named after the Garter.Julian Munby, Richard Barber and Richard Brown (2006).

Note also the review of this book in the Times Literary Supplement by Michael Prestwich in an article entitled A different circle 29 June 2007 page 29. =Round Tables elsewhere in Europe= Round Tables were an aristocratic activity throughout Europe from the 13th until the 15th centuries, being recorded in France from 1235 to 1332. In Aragon they were held as early as 1269 in Valencia and as late as 1291 in Catalonia. According to Roger Sherman Loomis, \\"Popes and prelates thundered against these costly, dangerous, and sometimes licentious frivolities, and denied Christian burial to those who took part.\\" Even the middle classes were caught up in this spectacle. In 1281, a burgher of Magdeburg announced a Round Table in that town. Another was set up by the burghers of Tournai in 1330.

Simak, featuring an educated Neanderthal, a biomechanical sabertooth tiger, aliens that move about on wheels, a man who time-travels using an unreliable device implanted in his brain, a ghost, trolls, banshees, goblins, a dragon and even Shakespeare himself. The Goblin Reservation was a Hugo Award nominee in 1969 and was originally serialized in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. Plot The Goblin Reservation is the tale of Professor Peter Maxwell. It is set in the distant future when the Earth has been transformed into a university planet; a planet where creatures from all over the galaxy come to study, teach, and be entertained by the amazing discoveries that Earth is now rich with. Among the many things that Earth can now boast is Time University: a university devoted to slipping through time and discovering the truth about past events. People and creatures from the past are brought forward in time to be interviewed, studied and to provide entertainment for the people of the future. Among these are Alley Oop, a very smart, if at times crude, Neanderthal rescued from certain death and educated in the future. The creatures that people of the past always thought to be myth‚Äîsuch as trolls, fairies, goblins, and the like‚Äîhave been discovered and placed on various reservations where they live and are studied by those working at Supernatural, a division of the planet- wide university. The story begins when Peter Maxwell comes home to Earth only to discover that he has died. He is forced to investigate his own \\"murder\\" and discover who or what wanted him dead. He also returns with an additional mystery. He was apparently copied by unknown aliens and sent to a hidden crystal world that may have come from the universe that existed before ours. The knowledge contained in the crystal planet could belong to Earth if Maxwell can discover what the intelligences remaining on the planet want. The alien race known as Wheelers want the Artifact, a monolith on display in a museum on Earth. The connection between the two provides the climax to the story. Before the events of the story, the University is expecting to close a lucrative deal for the Artifact, as well as mounting a prestigious series of talks by William Shakespeare in person. At the end, thanks to Maxwell, the deal is off, a dragon is on the loose, and Shakespeare has disappeared.

On his return he finds that he is a duplicate of the original Maxwell, who has been murdered. He himself spent time on a planet roofed entirely in crystal that seems to contain the secrets of a previous version of the universe. He has a mission to find an important item, which turns out to be something the University collected from the past, known as the Artifact. * Carol Hampton : A new hire at the University who was given Maxwell's old apartment. Maxwell's key still works, and the two encounter each other when he lets himself in. * Ally Oop : A Neanderthal rescued from cannibals in the past, and Maxwell's drinking buddy. He lets Maxwell stay with him. They spend much time drinking Oop's home-brewed moonshine. * Nancy Clayton : A society lady who hosts fashionable soirees, usually to introduce something new or bizarre. Maxwell gets what he thinks is an invitation, apparently because he has returned from the dead. However he is ushered secretly in the back door, and finds one of the Wheelers waiting to bargain with him for the crystal planet's knowledge. Nancy disavows all knowledge of the invitation, and planned the party for the Wheeler, who goes by the name \\"Mr. Marmaduke\\". * Mr. Churchill : Churchill is a freelance business agent and fixer who has taken on the Wheelers as clients. He \\"bumps into\\" Maxwell just after his return to Earth and continues to pester him on behalf of Mr. Marmaduke. * Harlow Sharpe : Sharpe is the head of the Time College. By the time Maxwell realizes the Wheelers' intent, Sharpe has already made a deal for the Artifact. Maxwell inadvertently wrecks all of Sharpe's plans, but in compensation the knowledge of the crystal planet is promised to Earth. * Mr. O'Toole : Leader of the Goblins and Maxwell's friend on the Goblin Reservation. Proud and arrogant, he is in conflict with the trolls who are ruining the precious October Ale. The trolls only want respect from the goblins and a share of the ale. * Wheelers : These are a race of aliens consisting of two wheels on either side of a translucent bubble containing luminous bugs. They apparently have hive minds. It is later revealed that they used to be the draft animals of the race that made the crystal planet and the Artifact. They can expel deadly noxious gases that were probably the cause of Maxwell's original \\"death\\". * The Banshee : A smoky wraith-like creature that is dying as an outcast on the reservation. Maxwell sits a death-watch with it, and in return the Banshee tells him the truth about the crystal planet. The banshees are messengers for the crystal planet and its creatures, and are still able to communicate with it. * Trolls : These creatures live in bridges they construct from stones, and are the only inhabitants of the Goblin Reservation who remember the ways of magic. Despised and ostracised by the goblins, they retaliate by preventing vehicles from flying over the Reservation, notably an air car carrying Maxwell that is forced to land when its power is cut. They also vandalize fairy rings and other structures. Maxwell gets concessions from the goblins in order for the trolls to bring down the Wheelers who are pursuing the dragon through the air. * William Shakespeare : Brought from the past, Shakespeare is scheduled to give a lecture about how he did not write the plays. His presence sparks a brawl between the English department and the Time department. * Sylvester the Sabre- Tooth : This is Carol Hampton's pet, a bio-mechanical re-creation of one of the extinct big cats. His appearance usually leads to mayhem. * The Artifact : Actually a dragon in suspended animation, it is accidentally freed when Maxwell uses a viewer given to him on the crystal planet. The Wheelers are trying to buy the Artifact from Earth. The first Maxwell was killed to prevent him revealing the truth about it. The Wheelers attack the dragon, and Maxwell has to negotiate peace between the goblins and the other creatures on the reservation in order to make them cooperate against the Wheelers. * Albert Lambert the Artist : A painter born in 1973 whose style changed radically for unknown reasons when he turned 50. His later work depicts a bizarre unearthly landscape, including the Artifact. He appears suddenly, using an erratic experimental time-travel device implanted in his brain. Shown his own work, he denies painting it, but says he will eventually because he only paints things he has seen. He identifies the Wheelers, the goblins and the other mythical creatures as those he saw attempting to colonize Earth from space in the Jurassic era. The paintings depict their cities. He returns to his own time using Time University's facilities. * The Ghost : An actual ghost who cannot remember who he used to be. At the end he is revealed to be the ghost of Shakespeare himself. The two dance together in the reservation at the story's conclusion.  References to actual locations  * Lake Mendota, at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, is mentioned in a scene where Maxwell reflects on the mess his life has become.

(2013). Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem. Cambridge University Press. p. 221. The Piddingtons never revealed their methods but did not claim to possess paranormal powers. There has been speculation from magicians about how they may have utilized codes, confederates or mechanical aids.Gorham, Maurice. (1951). Showmen & Suckers: An Excursion on the Crazy Fringe of the Entertainment World. Marshall. p. 80Britland, David. (1998). Psychic or Magic: What's Paranormal? Magic 9: 50-55. History Sydney Piddington spent time in Changi Prisoner of War camp during World War II. He discovered that maintaining the morale of prisoners in the camp was essential, and worked with fellow prisoner of war Russell Braddon to develop a mentalism act as entertainment for the troops. During this time, Sydney developed many unique and innovative techniques to give the appearance of mind-reading.Greenfield, George. (1995). A Smattering of Monsters: A Kind of Memoir. Camden House. pp. 94-96. Other fellow prisoners at Changi included Ronald Searle, who made sketches of life in the POW camp, and actor John Wood, with whom Piddington travelled home to Australia. Piddingtons website, biography section. Accessed 23 December 2017 Following the war, Sydney married Lesley Pope, to whom John Wood introduced him at a homecoming party given for Wood by the Minerva Theatre. Pope was the leading lady in the theatre's current production. Sydney taught Lesley many of the tricks that he had developed. Together they designed a stage act, and found success on Australian stages. Soon after, the Piddingtons moved to London, and in time they were signed to present a series of live radio broadcasts for the BBC. Seeking ever-impressive stunts, Sydney masterminded specialized tests to demonstrate Lesley's alleged ability to receive thoughts over a great distance. The BBC Broadcasts Many of the original radio broadcasts are still available. Among the more famous demonstrations undertaken by the Piddingtons were: The Diving Bell Experiment - Lesley was submerged in a diving bell in a swimming pool in Surrey whilst Sydney conducted tests with a live audience at the BBC studios in central London. The Tower of London - Lesley was kept under armed guard at the Tower of London across the river from the BBC studios, and was still able to determine items and names from the live audience. The Stratocruiser Broadcast - A famous experiment where Lesley was taken to cruising altitude in a plane above a British military base. Amongst other demonstrations, she was able to determine the personal possessions of an audience member chosen at random by the panel of judges in the studio. Secrecy of the Act The methods behind the Piddingtons' act were a closely guarded secret, unknown even to the producers at the BBC. Following Sydney's death in 1991, Lesley is said to have told her grandson, \\"Even if I wanted to tell you how it was done, I don't think I would be able\\". To this day, The Piddingtons are considered to be one of the greatest two-person telepathy acts of all time. Magicians have speculated that they may have utilized codes, confederates or mechanical aids. The controls for their experiments have been criticized. Regarding their experiment that took place in the Tower of London, Lesley had produced a sentence that had been written on a blackboard in the BBC studio. However, the sentence had already been read on the radio to listeners. Psychologist Robert H. Thouless noted that \\"no examination of Mrs Piddington's clothes or hair seems to have been made to ensure that she had not a wireless receiving set concealed on her person.\\"Thouless, Robert Henry. (1963). Experimental Psychical Research. Penguin Books. p. 60 In 2015, Martin Hart published a book which claimed to have finally revealed the secrets to the Piddington's tricks. The book is based on a notebook by Hart's grandfather who observed their methods while working on the BBC broadcasts.\\"News Number 752 - 22nd November 2014\\". MagicWeek.

Original structure In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, then the governing institution of the District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, the first in the capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation.Banks and Banks, 2004, p. 41. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital.Committee on the District of Columbia, 1978, p. 112. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 260. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets).Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 266‚Äì267. Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding.Gutheim and Lee, 2006, p. 267‚Äì271; Banks and Banks, 2004, p. 42.

West facade of Constitution Center, after its 2009 renovation. Issues surrounding the planning and construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately to the west of the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners.Historic American Buildings Survey, p. 109. Accessed 2011-04-20. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers. The building was constructed pursuant to an agreement between the General Services Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation.Rose, Seely, and Barrett, 2006, p. 134. GSA (the property owner and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965.Kessler, Ronald. \\"GSA Ex-Aide Hits Jackpot on Lease.\\" Washington Post. August 9, 1970. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA sent a letter to Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968.Goodman, S. Oliver. \\"D.C. Building Plans Skyrocket in June.\\" Washington Post. July 11, 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The building was designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.

It was the largest privately owned office building in the city at the time. Kirwan's contacts with Nassif later became the subject of a legal investigation. Kirwan not only shared inside information with Nassif about leasing plans of the GSA, he later invested in Nassif's D.C. business and became an officer in it. This relationship (Kirwan left GSA in December 1966, before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif), and GSA's irregular leasing of the building, became public knowledge in August 1970. An internal GSA audit was critical of the leasing process and the costs of the lease.\\"GSA Keeps Wraps on Audit Of DOT Headquarters Rental.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 1970. That same month, refinancing of the building was called into question. In the U.S., it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an interim loan (the \\"construction loan\\") to build a building. The interim loan is then paid off by a second lender, who becomes the mortgage lender and receives payments from the building's owner. Riggs Bank, a local D.C. bank, had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif. The New York City Employees Retirement System was to have paid off this construction loan. That payment was halted when the loan officer Nassif had dealt with was indicted for taking bribes to approve loans.Kessler, Ronald. \\"Indictment Stalls Loan On DOT Office Building.\\" Washington Post.

The celebrated key visual feature of the building, its exterior vertical white marble ribbing, was completely removed after it was found to be bowed from age and weather. Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell's building, there was almost no public outcry. It was replaced by an energy-efficient, all-glass facade. Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure's use of a chilled beam HVAC system, which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building. To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology, the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year. The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications. The installation represented the first large-scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States.Karidis, George. \\"Constitution Center Chills Out.\\" Consulting Specifying Engineer.

GSA reported in June 2012 that Constitution Center held too little space to house the entire FTC, and it was too costly to do so (after accounting for moving expenses and rental prices). GSA instead proposed that the FTC lease additional space at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW and 1800 M Street NW (where it already leased space, and where additional room was available).O'Connell, Jonathan. \\"GSA to Mica: FTC HQ Move Not Feasible.\\" Washington Post.

Biography DeDomenico was born in San Francisco, California and raised in the city's Mission District. He graduated from Mission High School, and took some business and accounting classes at Golden Gate University (then known as Golden Gate College). Because his family did not have enough money for a full college education, he began working for the family business, the Gragnano Macaroni Factory, immediately after graduating. When his father died in 1933 he and his brothers took over the business, now called Golden Grain Macaroni Company. He and his brothers invented the dried rice mixture Rice-A-Roni in 1958. In 1964 DeDomenico bought San Francisco Ghirardelli Chocolate Company, and built the company to the status of a world-famous chocolatier. The DeDomenicos sold both companies to the Quaker Oats Company in 1986 for $300 million. The next year, Vincent DeDomenico, at the age of 72, joined two other investors, Jack Hussey and Dr. Lee Block, who had purchased the right of way to an 1864 Southern Pacific rail line in Napa Valley, California. DeDomenico and his wife had ridden the Orient Express, and had a vision of creating a comparable level of wine, food, and luxury for rail passengers in California. He took over the project and won approval to use the line for the new tourism venture, the Napa Valley Wine Train, after years of local opposition. The wine train began operation in 1989. It now carries 100,000 passengers per year and is credited in part with initiating the rise of downtown Napa, California as a tourism destination, despite constant litigation over flood control, increased congestion, and other issues that continues as of 2007. On the 10th anniversary of the train's operation, DeDomenico was honored with the Walter E. Disney Railroader Award by the Carolwood Pacific Historical Society for restoring and preserving the vintage train. In later years DeDomenico operated a ranch in the Sacramento Valley. He went to work until the day that he died, dying quietly in his sleep after a full day at the wine train office. DeDomenico was married to Mildred DeDomenico for over 60 years, until his death. DeDemenico was described by friends and adversaries as a persistent and tough businessman, but quiet and courteous in private. A private family man, DeDomenico enjoyed 1-2 glasses of wine per day. DeDomenico's wife, Mildred, died on November 26, 2007, five weeks after his death.

He is the longest-serving post-war manager of Bristol Rovers, and their second-longest-serving of all time behind Alfred Homer. His playing and management careers were split by the Second World War. As a player he spent time with Clapton FC and Romford before ending his official playing days with Charlton Athletic in 1939, although he did go on to make a number of guest appearances for other clubs after this date in unofficial wartime friendlies. After the hostilities ended he returned to football firstly as a coach and later as manager of Erith & Belvedere, then after a brief spell in Norway where he spent a season at the helm of Fredrikstad he took over as Bristol Rovers' boss in 1950. Early life Tann was born in Plaistow, now part of Greater London, in May 1914, one of eleven children brought up in the family home. His father earned a living working as a ship painter in London's Docklands area. He showed an aptitude for sport throughout his childhood, and as well as playing football for London Boys, West Ham Boys and the Essex County F.A. he was also an accomplished cricketer and athlete. Playing career Tann's career as a footballer was a relatively short one. He joined his first professional club, Charlton Athletic, in 1933 and he would spend just six years among the pro ranks before League football was put on hiatus in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II. During this time he made just nineteen appearances in the Football League, scoring twice. Prior to turning professional he had played as an amateur, spending a season with each of Clapton Orient (now Leyton Orient) in 1931‚Äì32 and Romford the following year, earning an income during this period working as a painter and decorator with his father. While no League football was being played during the Second World War he made guest appearances in unofficial friendly matches for Southampton, for whom he played 36 times, and West Ham United where he played just a single game. Coaching career After the end of the Second World War Tann opted not to take up an opportunity to return to painting and decorating in the family business, but instead decided to try to forge a career in football coaching. He was able to find work as a coach with Kent side Erith & Belvedere, and it wasn't long before he was appointed as their manager. In 1947 he was one of a number of English coaches given the opportunity to travel to Norway, where he was given the role of manager with Fredrikstad FK and led them to the 1946‚Äì47 √òstfoldserien championship. He began working as a staff coach at The Football Association and from there he was taken on as a member of the coaching staff at Bristol Rovers in 1948. Eighteen months later, in January 1950, he was promoted to the job of first team manager, replacing Brough Fletcher who had held the position for the previous twelve years. It was an important moment in Rovers' history as by the end of his eighteen years in charge he would be considered one of the club's greatest ever managers. Under Tann's leadership Rovers implemented a no-buy no-sell policy on players, meaning the squad would be built up almost entirely of men living locally and would prevent the loss of their best players to other clubs, as had happened previously when Eddie Hapgood left the club as a teenager and went on to become captain of England. The policy was a success and the club was able to build a talented team which, under Tann's leadership, they enjoyed the most successful period in the club's history. Rovers were promoted to the Football League Second Division for the first time in their history in 1952‚Äì53, and he led them to 6th-place finishes in both the 1955‚Äì56 and 1958‚Äì59 seasons, as well to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1950‚Äì51 and 1957‚Äì58. No-buy no-sell was made possible by the existence of football's maximum wage rule, which forbade clubs paying more than ¬£20 a week in wages to any player. This rule was growing increasingly unpopular and was eventually abolished in 1961 amid threats of a strike by the players' union. The fact that they could now earn market value for their services meant that smaller clubs, like Rovers, could no longer afford to hold on to their best players as they looked for bigger pay packets elsewhere. Tann continued as manager until 1968, but never managed the same level of success as he had during the maximum-wage era. His eighteen years at the helm make him the longest-serving post-war manager of Bristol Rovers, and the second longest of all time behind Alfred Homer. After vacating the role of first team manager in 1968 he remained at the club and was appointed to the role of general manager and secretary, positions he held until his death five years later. On Tuesday 4 July 1972 he was admitted to hospital with heart strain and died there three days later.

(An earlier claim was successfully made by Mercedes Gleitze). Lowry, a student at Manchester High School for Girls and a keen swimmer from a young age, joined the Victoria Ladies Swimming Club of Victoria Baths, Longsight, Manchester. At that time (c. 1920) Victoria Baths only offered single-sex swimming sessions and therefore Sunny was unable to compete against the men. She was developing an aptitude for long-distance swimming and used to train with her sister at Levenshulme baths so that she could attempt distance swimming competitions on Windermere. She also practised distance swimming in the sea at her parents‚Äô holiday home in Rhos-on-Sea in North Wales. On one occasion she swam from her home to Colwyn Bay and back again. Her father, noticing her increasing talent at distance swimming in the sea suggested that she train for her ambition to swim the Channel. This she did, choosing Westgate on Sea near Margate in Kent as an appropriate venue. Sunny's trainer in Kent was Jabez Woolffe who had put her on a high protein diet (including eating 40 eggs a week in omelettes). She trained for 3 or 4 hours a day in the buildup to her first attempt. Her first attempt was from England to France and took place on 10 August 1932. She got quite close to the French coast but eventually the strong east-west currents from France prevented her from finishing. Wolffe and Captain Courtez, the captain of the support tug \\"Isobelle\\", called off the attempt. It still took them 45 minutes before they could find her to help her out of the water. Eventually lightning flashes allowed them to see her red swimming cap. On 27 July 1933, Lowry attempted the swim again only this time choosing to let the current help her instead of hindering her. Accordingly, she changed direction and made the swim from France to England. Unfortunately once again she was unsuccessful. Making her third attempt on 28 August 1933, Sunny, aged 22, successfully swam from Cap Gris Nezin France to St Margarets Bay, Dover; the swim took her 15 hours 41 minutes. Once again she was supported by Wolffe and Courtez. Lowry had a reputation for strong-mindedness, which was demonstrated by her eschewing the traditional heavy wool one-piece swimsuit in favour of a, at the time very daring, lighter two-piece suit. For this she was berated as being a \\"harlot\\" for baring her knees. This swimsuit is now on display at the Dover Museum \\"Swimming The Channel\\" exhibition. Lowry is one of only five British women to have ever successfully swum the Channel. At the age of 94, in the 2005 Honours list, she was awarded an MBE for services to swimming in the North-West. In July 2003, at the age of 92, Sunny was inducted into the International Marathon Swimming Association's Hall of Fame. She died at the age of 97 on 21 February 2008 at Warrington Hospital.

History In 1838, a Cavalry School of Practice was established at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, which in time also became the Army's recruiting center for new mounted recruits. Commanded by Edwin Vose Sumner, the program was started from scratch. The close association between field artillery and mounted units began with the location of the Army's light artillery, also in Carlisle, in 1839. Captain Samuel Ringgold trained his recruits and tested equipment for the \\"flying artillery\\", as it was called, and gained fame during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Beginning in the 1880s, the U.S. Army reestablished schools to provide intensive training in military specialties. The first of these was the School of Application for Infantry and Cavalry, founded at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1881 by William Tecumseh Sherman. For graduates of the United States Military Academy, the school allowed practical application of the theories they had learned at the Academy. Here, also, student officers detailed from the field improved their knowledge of their profession. In 1901, the school was expanded into the General Service and Staff College and opened to officers of all branches; today, it is the Command and General Staff College In 1887, the U.S. Congress appropriated $200,000 for a school at Fort Riley, Kansas, to instruct enlisted men in cavalry and light artillery, but five years went by before the Cavalry and Light Artillery School was formally established and moved from Fort Leavenworth. The Fort Riley post hospital, built in 1855, was remodeled in 1890 and became the headquarters and home for the school. In the years that followed, the school changed names. It was called the Mounted Service School from 1907 until World War I, when instruction ended for the duration of the war. In 1919, the Cavalry School took its place and continued until October 1946. With the final disposition of tactical cavalry horses in March 1947, the Army ended all training and educational programs dealing with mounted troops. With the closure of the cavalry school, a new educational function continued on 1 November 1946 at Fort Riley with the Ground General School, training newly commissioned officers in basic military subjects.

It is her second collection of stories, following Interpreter of Maladies (which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction). As with much of Lahiri's work, Unaccustomed Earth considers the lives of Bengali American characters and how they deal with their mixed cultural environment.Wonder Bread and Curry: Mingling Cultures, Conflicted Hearts: Review by Michiko Kakutani for The New York Times.\\"Jhumpa Lahiri‚Äôs latest book continues to explore the immigrant experience\\" By N.P. Thompson for Northwest Asian Weekly. The book was Lahiri's first #1 on the New York Times Best-sellers list, where it debuted at the top spot. Title and contents The title of the collection is taken from a passage in \\"The Custom-House,\\" the preface to The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Four of the eight stories (\\"Hell-Heaven\\", \\"Nobody's Business\\", \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", and \\"Year's End\\") were previously published in The New Yorker Part One =\\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" = The title story of the book is about the family relationships between three generations: the father, his daughter, Ruma, and her son, Akash. The father, a retiree and recent widower, visits his daughter's new home in the suburbs of Seattle. Ruma has left her successful legal career to raise children, and her husband works hard to support the family. Although more traditional her father tries to persuade her to continue her legal career while being a mother. The father was somewhat unhappy with his once-traditional lifestyle and is enjoying his newly found independence in his travels and a relationship with a new female friend. The father and the daughter have limited communication, both afraid to acknowledge they have moved away from their Bengali culture and have embraced aspects of the American culture. Akash, the grandson, is completely immersed in American culture but becomes fascinated by his grandfather's habits, such as his language, that are foreign to him. The story explores gender roles in America and family issues associated with Ruma's Bengali heritage, including her sense of obligation to care for her father and have him live with her and her immediate family. Also present is the dilemma of coming between another person's happiness, a situation Ruma encounters when she learns of her father's love interest. =\\"Hell-Heaven\\"= Pranab Chakraborty, a graduate student at MIT, is contemplating returning to Calcutta due to homesickness. On the streets of Boston he sees a little girl, Usha, and her traditional Bengali mother Aparna. He follows them and ends up befriending them. Aparna, herself homesick and lonely, empathizes with Pranab and is happy to feed him. Pranab Kaku (\\"Uncle Pranab\\") becomes a regular visitor at their house and calls Aparna as \\"Boudi\\" (meaning \\"elder brother's wife\\"). Over time Aparna looks forward eagerly to Pranab's visits and develops a unique kind of love towards him. Adding to the situation is Usha's father's (Shyamal da) aloof and detached attitude towards her mother. Aparna's love for Pranab turns into jealousy when Pranab brings home an American woman, Deborah, whom he eventually marries. Aparna continuously blames and criticizes Deborah, stating that it is just a matter of time before Deborah leaves Pranab. After twenty- three years Deborah and Pranab finally divorce. The story also recounts the unique mother-daughter relationship that develops between Aparna and Usha; after many struggles and squabbles, Aparna placates her daughter by relating her own experiences about a foolish decision that she would have made. The title is drawn from this passage in the story: \\"'He used to be so different. I don‚Äôt understand how a person can change so suddenly. It's just hell-heaven, the difference,' she would say, always using the English words for her self- concocted, backward metaphor.\\" =\\"A Choice of Accommodations\\"= Amit and his wife Megan travel to his high school alma mater Langford for Pam's wedding. Pam, the daughter of the headmaster of Langford, and Amit were close despite never having a formal relationship with each other. Both Amit and Megan are insecure the night of the wedding; Amit mainly for mistaking his former classmate \\"Ted\\" for \\"Tim,\\" and Megan mainly because there is a small burn on her skirt. After consuming two spiked punches, he is completely drunk; he admits to a guest nearby that he feels detached from Megan. He later remembers that he has to call Megan's in-laws to check-in on their daughters. Since reception for cell phones is poor at Langford, he returns to the hotel to use their room's landline but before he is able to remember the number, he crashes. Amit wakes up, shocked to learn that it is late the next morning. Megan, sitting outside on the balcony, expresses her discontent. Remembering that Pam mentioned a brunch, they head back to Langford. They find out that the brunch ended an hour ago. Despite this, they roam Langford together and when they arrive at one of the dorms, Megan asks about Amit sexual past and even suspects that he slept with Pam. He denies this, and they ultimately have sex in the dorm. =\\"Only Goodness\\"= Sudha, while visiting home in Wayland from Penn for Christmas, agrees with her teen-aged brother, Rahul, to sneak beer into their parents' house. He agrees, and even purchases vodka, too. The following summer, they see each other again, and it is revealed that Rahul first term grades at Cornell are dramatically lower than his high school grades, which causes concern to their parents. He is also arrested for possession of alcohol while driving. Meanwhile, Sudha has been accepted into the London School of Economics. A few years go by; Rahul drops out and Sudha becomes engaged to Roger, a Brit, a decision that their parents approve of highly. Rahul lives with their parents, working a menial job. Shortly before Sudha's wedding, Rahul announces that he is engaged to a woman named Elena. This causes a rift in their family. Further, at the wedding, Rahul's alcoholism becomes apparent to everyone when he fights with their father over the microphone while he is toasting. This causes Rahul to become disconnected with the family for a few years. Meanwhile, Sudha, while living in London, gives birth to a boy, Neel. She responds to Rahul, who originally gave notice that he is coming to London to visit them. Rahul acts as a responsible uncle to Neel; he reveals that he has given up alcohol and takes care of Elena's daughter Crystal, although they have yet to marry. He becomes close with Neel. One day near the end of his visit, he suggests that Sudha and Roger go out for a movie and leave him at the apartment with Neel. Skeptical, they agree given that Rahul has been exemplary during his time in London. Sudha and Roger return to find Rahul passed out and Neel in the bath, which causes a quarrel between Sudha and Roger. Rahul awakens and learns that he somehow, against all of his willpower, consumed some alcohol. He leaves, realizing that he has lost Sudha's trust forever. At the same time, Sudha feels partly responsible for her naive actions many years before. =\\"Nobody's Business\\"= Sang, short for Sangeeta, receives calls from suitors often, which alarms her housemates, Paul and Heather. However, Sang rejects all of them as she is in a relationship with Farouk, an Egyptian man. During the fall, this relationship becomes muddled. While Sang is in London and Heather is out on a skiing trip in the winter, Paul receives a call from a woman identifying herself as Deirdre. Deirdre obsessively calls the house and Paul learns that she is a lover of Farouk currently in Vancouver; he decides to not tell this to Sang when she returns. Over a few months, Sang learns that Deirdre called and when Paul tells Sang what happened, she calls him a liar. Paul, disgusted at being scapegoated, ruses Deirdre into telling Sang what happened during the winter over the phone. Sang forgives Paul, and asks him to drive her to Farouk apartment. He does so and they confront Farouk together. When Farouk begins pushing Paul, the two men fight. Farouk is able to escape despite Paul overpowering him. The police arrive to calm the three. Sang, distraught, returns to London. Shortly after the incident, while in Boston, Paul sees Farouk with a woman. Paul plans to walk past them unnoticed but Farouk sees him and confronts him. After a peaceful exchange, Farouk walks away with the woman. Paul notices that the woman has a dog, and also remembers that when Deirdre called him, there were intermittent barks in the background. Part Two: \\"Hema and Kaushik\\" The story revolves around two people who, despite being childhood acquaintances and their families being old friends, lead drastically different lives. Two decades after Kaushik's family stays with Hema's as houseguests, they meet again by chance, just days before they are to enter into completely different phases of their lives, and they discover a strong connection with one another. The entire story of Hema and Kaushik is divided into three parts. =\\"Once in a Lifetime\\"= This section deals mostly with their childhood and is written in a first person address from Hema to Kaushik. It tells the story of two families who were close to each other because of shared culture and the common experience of adapting to a new culture, but who are beginning to drift apart due to reasons which become evident as the story progresses. =\\"Year's End\\"= This part is from Kaushik's point of view and tells about his life after his mother's death as he deals with unwanted change and navigates complicated relationships with his recently remarried father, stepmother, and two young stepsisters‚Äîa situation that will ultimately influence Kaushik to lead the life of a wanderer. =\\"Going Ashore\\"= The last part is related by an omniscient narrator as Hema and Kaushik meet by chance in Italy after two long decades. Hema, now a college professor, is tormented about her previous affair with a married man and plans to settle down by marrying Navin, someone she barely knows. Kaushik, a world traveling, successful photojournalist, is preparing to accept a desk job in Hong Kong. In spite of all that, they find their deep connection irresistible. They coincidentally reunite in Rome and relive their younger years together, exploring Italy together. Before leaving for a Christmas vacation, Kaushik asks Hema to leave Navin and come and live with him in Hong Kong. He tells her to brood about it while she is in Calcutta. Kaushik ultimately dies vacationing in Khao Lak when the 2004 tsunami occurs, never giving Hema a choice regarding their future together. Reception Writing in The New York Times, Liesl Schillinger says, \\"Reading her stories is like watching time-lapse nature videos of different plants, each with its own inherent growth cycle, breaking through the soil, spreading into bloom or collapsing back to earth.\\" Hirsh Sawhney, writing for The Guardian, believes that \\"is at core an old-guard New England writer. Her new book begins with a quote from Hawthorne, and this stirringly existential anthology recalls the New Englander JD Salinger's pessimistic vision of human relationships.\\" It made number one on the New York Times Book Review list of \\"10 Best Books of 2008\\" as chosen by the paper's editors.

Bauer. Ernst G. Bauer (born 1928) is a German-American physicist known for his studies in the field of surface science. His most prominent contributions are his work on establishing thin film growth and nucleation mechanisms and his invention in 1962 of the Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), which came to fruition in 1985 in the workgroup of Ernst Bauer in Germany. In the early 90s, he extended the LEEM technique in two directions by developing Spin-Polarized Low Energy Electron Microscopy (SPLEEM) and Spectroscopic Photo Emission and Low Energy Electron Microscopy (SPELEEM). He is currently Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at the Arizona State University. Biography Ernst Bauer studied at the Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Germany, where he received his master's degree MS (1953) and Doctor of Philosophy PhD (1955) degrees in physics. In 1958 he moved to the Michelson Laboratory in China Lake, California, where he became the Head of the Crystal Physics Branch and a U.S. citizen. He assumed the position of Professor and Director of the Physics Institute at the Technical University Clausthal, Germany, in 1969. He was appointed Distinguished Research Professor in 1991 at the Arizona State University. He continued his research activity in Germany until 1996. Since 1996 he was working full-time at the Arizona State University, and since 2010 he is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus working part-time in ASU. Thin films and surfaces Ernst Bauer has contributed to the field of epitaxy and film growth since the mid-1950s. He started his scientific career in Munich with the study of the growth and structure of antireflection layers with electron microscopy and electron diffraction. His PhD thesis was concerned with the structure and growth of thin evaporated layers of ionic materials and was the first systematic extensive study of epitaxial and fiber orientation growth combining electron microscopy and electron diffraction. This experimental work stimulated a basic contribution to the theory of epitaxy. He derived in 1958 a classification of the basic thin film growth modes, which he called Frank-van der Merwe (layer- by-layer growth), Volmer-Weber (island growth) and Stranski-Krastanov growth (layer+island growth). His thermodynamic criterion and terminology are used worldwide today. In the same year Ernst Bauer's book on \\"Electron diffraction: theory, practice and application\\" appeared. Soon after his arrival at the Michelson Laboratory in California, surface science was born. He was involved early in it in order to understand thin film phenomena. In this period he started in situ thin film growth studies by conventional electron microscopy, Ultra high vacuum UHV reflection electron diffraction, Low-energy electron diffraction LEED and Auger electron spectroscopy. The importance of adsorption on the initial growth of thin films led him also to adsorption studies. Ernst Bauer realized already in 1961 that electron microscopy using the diffracted electrons for imaging would be extremely important for the future of the surface science. The invention in 1962 of the Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) was stimulated by a scientific dispute with Lester Germer about his interpretation of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) patterns in 1960. As in all earlier LEED studies Germer had assumed that LEED patterns can be interpreted by single scattering. Ernst Bauer corrected this by interpreting these observations by double scattering. He constructed the first LEEM instrument and reported it at the Fifth International Congress for Electron Microscopy in 1962. In the 1960s he developed also the theoretical background needed for the understanding of LEEM. After he moved to the Technical University Clausthal (Germany) in 1969 Ernst Bauer built up a broadly based surface science group encompassing a large variety of electron and ion beam techniques as well as optical methods. The quantitative analysis of thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS or TPD) was developed, a method now used widely in particular in surface chemistry. Work function measurements were developed and used for the determination of the thermodynamic properties of two- dimensional systems with attractive lateral interactions. For the study of two-dimensional systems with repulsive or oscillatory interactions, his group developed LEED diffractometry. He developed electron stimulated desorption (ESD) and static SIMS for the study of adsorbed layers and ultrathin films on single crystal surfaces; alkali ion scattering (ISS) for structural analysis of surfaces; field ion microscopy (FIM) of single atoms and clusters; UHV-SEM studies of surface melting. Ernst Bauer has pioneering contributions to the most aspects of surface science since its inception. Surface electron microscopy with low energy electrons (LEEM, SPLEEM, SPELEEM, PEEM etc.) Considerable understanding of surfaces and thin films has been achieved by laterally averaging measurement techniques, but it has become evident that many problems can be solved only by laterally resolving methods (surface microscopy). Ernst Bauer invented Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) already in 1962 but he had to overcome intense skepticism of scientists and also many scientific and funding obstacles before finally LEEM came to fruition in 1985. His work was brought to the attention of a much wider general scientific community in the nineteen eighties, when the mature LEEM began producing the very impressive real-time high-resolution dynamic image recordings of atomic processes such as crystal nucleation and growth, sublimation, phase transitions and epitaxy on surfaces. The high signal intensities available in LEEM (compared to X-ray imaging) allowed observing surface structure and dynamic processes in real space and real time at sample temperatures up to 1500 K with 10 nm lateral resolution and atomic depth resolution. Since 1985 many experiments with surface electron microscopy with low energy electrons were performed in Ernst Bauer's group. The scientific results of his studies are published in 212 papers (57 of them review articles). In the late 1980s early 1990s Ernst Bauer extended the LEEM technique in two important directions by developing Spin-Polarized Low Energy Electron Microscopy (SPLEEM) and Spectroscopic Photo Emission and Low Energy Electron Microscopy (SPELEEM). The combination of these methods now allows a comprehensive (structural, chemical, magnetic and electronic) characterization of surfaces and thin films on the 10 nm scale. Above 60 LEEM instruments are now installed and operating in many laboratories and synchrotron radiation facilities around the world (USA, Europe and Asia). An important recognition for Ernst Bauer's efforts in the field of surface microscopy is the increasing number of the scientists involved in LEEM research, which is reflected in the organization of bi-annual LEEM/PEEM workshops, the first of which was organized by Ernst Bauer and Anastassia Pavlovska in Arizona in 1998. The next Number eleven LEEM/PEEM11 workshop will be held 2018 in China. The high brightness of third generation synchrotron radiation sources has opened the door to chemical and magnetic surface imaging with resolutions in the 10 nm range. After synchrotron radiation light source ELETTRA in Trieste eight other synchrotron radiation sources: SLS in Switzerland, Spring-8 in Japan, Diamond in Great Britain, Maxlab in Sweden, ALBA in Spain, BNL in USA, SSRF in China, Synchrotron Thailand, are now also equipped with SPELEEM instruments. The success of the instrument developments in Bauer's group in Technical University Clausthal has led to the commercial production of these instruments and stimulated several other groups to develop similar instruments for surface imaging with low energy electrons, resulting in a variety of commercial instruments. Thus the Ernst Bauer's group in Clausthal has become the cradle of modern surface electron microscopy with low energy electrons. Surface electron microscopy using low energy electrons started with the invention of LEEM. Today there are hundreds of the various versions of these instruments in the world and are further developed, continuously broadening their application range. Ernst Bauer's work directly or indirectly impacts many areas of modern materials science: surfaces, thin films, electronic materials, catalysis and instrumentation. The invention and development of surface microscopy with low energy electrons has revolutionized the study of surface science and thin film science. Ernst Bauer has authored or co-authored more than 460 publications (among them 88 review papers and book chapters) and two books: \\"Electron Diffraction: Theory, Practice and Applications\\", 1958 (in German) and ‚ÄúSurface Microscopy with Low Energy Electrons‚Äù, 2014. The contributions to the society By transfer of knowledge: Typical for Ernst Bauer is that he had longstanding scientific international cooperation in his whole career. Bauer had visiting scientists from USA, India, Japan, China, Greece, South Africa, Canada, Sweden, Korea, Holland etc. (total 82 visitors). Presently Ernst Bauer has intensive international collaborations with Japan, Poland, Italy, Germany and Hong Kong. Colloquim/seminar talks and by teaching at international summer schools and courses (137 talks from 1997 until 2017). Supervisor of 22 PhD Thesis and 16 Master Thesis in the Technical University of Clausthal (Germany) and in Arizona State University (U.S.). An important recognition for Ernst Bauer's efforts in the field of surface microscopy is the increasing number of the scientists involved in LEEM research, which is reflected in the organization of bi-annual LEEM/PEEM workshops, the first of which was organized by Ernst Bauer and Anastassia Pavlovska in Arizona in 1998. By initiating these conferences Ernst Bauer achieved the exchange of know-how within the LEEM community, which is already very big. Ten such conferences were already held very successfully. Ernst Bauer's contributed to the sustainable development of society by initiative for Arizona State University's solar energy program. He initiated successfully in 2006 the Arizona State University's solar energy efforts, which came already to fruition in 2008 and expanded tremendously until 2014. As of March 2014, ASU was the top institution of higher education in the United States for solar generating capacity.

Robinson gained notoriety in Northern Ireland for streetfighting, robbery and for owning a pet lion. His contemporaries included James \\"Stormy\\" Wetherall and Patrick \\"Silver\\" McKee. Early life Born on York Street in the Sailortown area of Belfast, present day Northern Ireland, around 1901, Robinson's early life in the docks was indicative of his future problems with the law. In 1913 at the age of twelve, he was arrested on a charge of larceny. In 1916 he was arrested three more times for the same offence. He was discharged on three out of four of these first offences, and received probation for the other. He served in the British Merchant Navy towards the end of World War I. On his return to Belfast his criminal career expanded, being charged with assault, riotous behaviour and robbery by 1921. Career in the Ulster Special Constabulary In October 1920 the British Government formed the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) after calls from Unionists for protection. This was to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary who, along with the Black and Tans, were fighting the Irish Republican Army in the Irish War of Independence. The USC was formed on 1 November 1920, and consisted mainly of former Ulster Volunteers and other soldiers of the 36th (Ulster) Division who had served in World War I. Robinson was recruited to the USC's C1 section, which was made up of unpaid, non-uniformed reservists usually only called up in emergencies.The Thin Green Line ‚Äì The History of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC, Richard Doherty, published by Pen & Sword Books ‚Äì Joe Graham of Rushlight Magazine has stated that Robinson was given the option of prison or joining up after assaulting a member of the wealthy Thompson family on the Glencairn Road, with Thompson's own hammer. During this time Robinson claimed to have been Dawson Bates' bodyguard, who was Minister for Home Affairs in Sir James Craig's government. He won his first significant amateur boxing bout at the King's Hall in 1922 representing the USC and would later go on to win the Irish middleweight championship in 1927. Interned As well as being a Special Constable, Robinson was also a member of the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Protestant Association. The group's aim, according to a police report of 1923, was \\"simply the extermination of Catholics by any and every means\\".Alan F. Parkinson, Belfast's Unholy War, p279 The police thought Robinson, who led a UPA group on Andrews street, was, \\"a dangerous gunman and leader of a murderous gang\\". In the press he was known as the \\"Docklands gunman and bomber\\"both refs from Parkinson p281 With the end of the Anglo- Irish war and partition in 1922, Robinson left the USC. After being implicated in several shootings and bombings he was interned in October 1922. Several documents on his detention exist, including a letter from the RUC Commissioner recommending his internment: > \\"The respectable and law-abiding Protestants and Unionists residing in the > area want to have these men taken from the locality at any cost, as they > truly state there can be no peace so long as they are at large.\\" Another police report states: > \\"No matter what part of the City there is fighting in, he goes there to give > a hand. He does not know what fear is, and would go any place to shoot and > kill with either rifle, revolver or bomb.\\" The documents also contain other incidents Robinson was implicated in, including several shootings and a bombing. Robinson was released in 1923 and agreed to relocate to Bolton. He soon returned and was reinterned, and released again in late 1923.http://www.theirishstory.com/2016/02/15/the-mad- dance-of-death-the-ulster-protestant-association-in-belfast-1921-22/ His second release may have been secured through the promise that he would move to Chicago where he had relatives. In an interview with the north Belfast playwright Martin Lynch in the 1980s, Robinson claimed he worked for Al Capone and Joseph Kennedy. He was later deported from the United States. Criminal convictions Robinson was back in Belfast by the late 1920s. Writer Sam McAughtry recalled a banner reading \\"Welcome Home Buck Alec\\" being raised above York Street in the city. His criminal convictions continued through to World War II. Around this time he acquired three lions. Sources vary as to how these were acquired, one that they came from a visiting circus which Robinson allowed to use waste ground he owned at the rear of his house on Back Ship Street. Journalist Seth Linder writes that the lions were acquired from Dublin and Belfast Zoo, with Alec displaying them at a travelling circus throughout Ireland. He kept the toothless lions at his home. Belfast folklore tells of him walking them on the streets of Sailortown. He continued to be known as a streetfighter into his fifties. Local newspapers regularly covered his fights in Belfast, the last known being in 1959. In court Robinson claimed he had knocked a man unconscious as he disagreed with the language he was using. Death and tributes Buck Alec continued to live in north Belfast until his death in 1995. Gusty Spence and Ian Paisley attended his funeral, the latter carrying the coffin and describing Robinson as \\"a rare character, a typical Ulsterman, an interesting facet of Ulster's history\\".

The Royal Mines Act 1688 repealed the Act Against Multipliers (5 Henry IV c. 4) (1404) which had made it a felony to create gold and silver by means of alchemy. The Act specified also that \\"no mine of tin, copper, iron or, lead, shall hereafter be adjudged, reputed, or taken to be a royal mine although gold or silver may be extracted out of the same.\\" In doing so, the Act brought to an end the monopolies of the Society of Mines Royal and the Company of Mineral and Battery Works which had enjoyed exclusive rights to extract metal from certain mines. According to Isaac Newton, in a letter to John Locke, Robert Boyle 'procured the repeal of the Act of Parliament against Multipliers'. He further claimed that Boyle must then have had in his hands a recipe for the production of gold by alchemical means. The Royal Mines Act 1688, except the last section, was repealed by section 1 of, and the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1867.

Frank Baum and his successors. Its exact location is unclear between text and maps. The Road to Oz states that Ev is to the north of the Land of Oz, and in Ozma of Oz, Princess Ozma of Oz and her procession enter the Munchkin Country and meet the King of the Munchkins upon leaving the palace at Evna, the capital city. Subsequent books place Ev nearer to the Winkie Country, and the map on the endpapers of Tik-Tok of Oz shows the Munchkin Country as having no northern border with the desert that surrounds Oz, as a thin strip of the Gillikin Country extends even farther east than most of the Munchkin Country. This map depicts Ev as a small country to the northwest (the compass rose is reversed) of Oz, with the Dominions of the Nome King as a separate area. James E. Haff and Dick Martin's map, following the text, place the Nome Kingdom under an Ev that takes up the entire portion allotted to the Nome King's dominions on Baum's map. Classic books King Evoldo of Ev sold his unnamed Queen and their ten children, Princess Evanna, Prince Evardo, Princess Evedna, Princess Evella, Prince Evington, Princess Evirene, Prince Evring, Prince Evrob, Prince Evroland, and Princess Evrose, to Roquat, the Nome King, whose dominions are underneath Ev, in exchange for a long life. Evoldo regretted it and destroyed the life that King Roquat had provided him. Believing that Roquat had simply stolen the royal family, the Ozites entered the kingdom on a diplomatic mission to free them. When Roquat informs them of the fair deal, they play by his rules, and thanks to Billina, win back the family of Ev and the Nome King's Magic Belt. During the time that the family was enslaved, Princess Langwidere, Evoldo's niece, took the throne as regent, but was too vain to do many administrative tasks, and spent most of her time admiring her 30 interchangeable heads. She had three wings of the palace demolished in order to direct visitors to the left wing, which is to one's right, but is the only wing left. She is relieved to give up the throne to her cousin, King Evardo, the eldest of Evoldo's children. Also in Evna is the factory of Smith and Tinker, who created Tik-Tok and the Giant with the Hammer, the latter to the specifications of King Roquat, the former a unique and prototypical gift to King Evoldo. Tik-Tok reports that Smith drowned in his own painting while Tinker built a ladder to the moon, so they are no longer in Evna. Later stories, such as Mr. Tinker in Oz and \\"Button-Bright and the Knit-Wits of Oz\\" from Oziana 1987, reveal them alive and well. In most subsequent books, visits to Ev are primarily under Ev, and few of its inhabitants or towns are ever seen. Known unusual creatures consist only of the Wheelers who claim the Royal Family's Lunch Box Trees and Dinner Pail Trees and defend them through scaring travelers, though they are scrawny and have wheels made of keratin rather than hands or feet. The Royal Family of Ev again appears in The Road to Oz, having changed but little from its initial disenchanted appearance. The family, without cousin Langwidere, are honored guests at Ozma's birthday party. In later books Ruth Plumly Thompson made a major addition to Ev in the form of Jinnicky the Red Jinn, Wizard of Ev, who has a red glass palace nearer to the edge of the Land of Ix, which compasswise is either northeast or northwest. Sometimes Thompson implies that Jinnicky is the ruler of Ev, though she included a mention of Evardo briefly in The Wishing Horse of Oz that regarded him as a boy king, though if he is still a boy king at this point, Evoldo would have had no motivation for trading his family. Thompson's The Hungry Tiger of Oz introduces Rash, a small principality within Ev ruled by Prince Evered, as well as Down Town and Immense City. The Wishing Horse of Oz introduces Bitty Bit, the Seer of Some Summit. Jack Snow's The Shaggy Man of Oz includes a visit to the Valley of Romance in Ev, ruled by King Ticket and Queen Curtain, and the underground Kingdom of the Fairy Beavers. In Out of Oz, the fourth and final volume of \\"The Wicked Years\\", Gregory Maguire's revisionist Oz series, Tip mentions that Mombey took him across the sands to \\"one of the duchy principalities, I think it was Ev\\" to visit \\"some second- rate duchess\\" who knew how to change the appearance of her head and body. Points of interest * Dooners: * Down Town: A town that is located underneath the Land of Ev. It is described as much like the downtown places in the cities of the United States. The inhabitants of Down Town are obsessed with work and making money (even their clothes are made of money). Only the males are allowed on the streets of Down Town while the females stay at home.

It lived probably during the Maastrichtian, 70 million years ago (mya), and was found in Lance Creek Formation rocks in Wyoming (United States) though it seems still somewhat unclear if it did fossilize there or was reworked from later (Danian: Early Paleocene, less than 65 mya) deposits. Lonchodytes estesi, the type species, appears to be closely related to the ancestor of some modern birds. It is most often allied - albeit tentatively - with the Gaviiformes (loons/divers), Procellariiformes (tubenoses) or Pelecaniformes. It was found to be closer to Procellariiformes than to the other orders by a cladistic analysis.Mortimer (2004) These are today generally believed to be closely related if not actually a clade, perhaps together with other \\"higher waterbirds\\" such as penguins. L. estesi might be basal to some lineages among these three, and/or other \\"higher waterbirds\\", a hypothesis by and large compatible with current phylogenetic analyses based on morphological and DNA sequence data, as well as the Mesozoic record of Neornithes. \\"Lonchodytes\\" pterygius on the other hand quite likely does not belong into this genus. It appears very distinct from in a cladistic phylogeny and seems to be a member of the Charadriiformes.

Despite being a representative of the king to Naples, he was accused of spreading sedition and instigating riots during unrest in 1585 and 1620. After periods of imprisonment and exile, and then in his 80s, he returned to Naples and began advising the fisherman and smuggler Tommaso Aniellolater known as Masanielloa popular figure among the city's populace. Genoino was the real power behind the popular movement, and supplied the directionless and illiterate Masaniello with advice and a coherent policy. Following the uprising of 7 July, and the assassination of Masaniello on 16 July, the Viceroy attempted to restore order by handing governance of the city to Genoino. He was unable to resist the most extreme demands of the populace. Following a second revolution in August, Genoino was exiled and the Neapolitan Republic proclaimed.

It is a part of the Woodland Park School District. History The original Woodland Park School, built in 1890, was a two-story, white frame building with two teachers. The school was built on a plot of land behind the current location of the Cultural Center. During 1924, the school was consolidated with four other districts, involving the Edlow District located three miles west of Woodland Park, and three teachers were then needed. Only grades 1-10 were served; grades 11 and 12 went to Manitou Springs High School. Woodland Park School District voters approved a bond issue shortly after World War I and, with government aid, constructed a brick school building containing four classrooms and a large central stage where many community functions were held. The first graduation of the high school happened in 1926. From 1935 to 1938, the gymnasium at Midland Avenue was constructed and two more classrooms were added. By 1942, there were 107 students enrolled in all grades. In, 1946 the Divide school district was brought into the Woodland Park School District. In 1959 the residents of Teller County voted to reduce the school districts to two: Cripple Creek- Victor Re-1 and Woodland Park Re-2. This added the Midland and Florissant schools to the Woodland Park School District. In 1975 a new junior high was built at the spot where the high school now stands. By 1984 the school district was bursting at the seams. The kindergarten was housed in a rented building on Baldwin and the district administration was housed in a rented building on Highway 24. In 1986 construction started on the middle school, which was finished in 1991. By 1990 the district was educating over 3,200 students. In 2003 another bond issue was approved by the voters which allowed for $14.6 million of expansion and repairs at the high school which included 11 new classrooms, new shop facilities, band and choir room and a new performing arts auditorium. More parking space was also added. WPHS now serves approximately 950 students in grades 9 through 12. In 2006, the school had a graduation rate of 86.7%. Mascot The Woodland Park High School mascot is a black panther. Extracurricular activities Woodland Park High School offers many extracurricular activities.

A single species has been named (Palintropus retusus) based on a proximal coracoid from the Lance Formation of Wyoming, dated to the latest Maastrichtian, million years ago. Coracoids and a proximal scapula of two unnamed species from the upper Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, dating to between 76.5 and 75 million years ago, are also known.Hope (2002) Initially it was placed in the wastebin genus \\"Cimolopteryx\\". Pierce Brodkorb assigned it its current name, first affiliating it with Apatornis in 1963, and establishing its current genus in 1970.Brodkorb (1970) Its relationships are not well determined, mainly due to the paucity of material. Several major theories have been established: Like many of the birds of the subtropical coastlands of the Western Interior Seaway - maybe a bit like eastern Australia today - it is sometimes believed to be an early member of the Charadriiformes (waders, gulls, auks, etc.; see also \\"Graculavidae\\"). However, an alternate theory is that it is a galliform, perhaps a quercymegapodiid. In 2009, Longrich and colleagues proposed that Palintropus is a primitive bird related to Apsaravis. They conducted the first cladistic analysis of the remains, and found this to be the most likely hypothesis, suggesting Palintropus warrants inclusion in the newly established Palintropiformes.Longrich, N.

Little is known about his life, but he is known for having uttered an 1881 prophecy of the coming of a church that would be for the MƒÅori people. Prophecy In March 1881, several thousand members of the NgƒÅti Hamua gathered near Masterton for a hui in the Nga Tau e Waru meeting house at Te Ore Ore Marae. During the meeting, PƒÅora Te Potangaroa spoke of the spiritual impotency of the Christian missionaries that had visited the MƒÅori. When some of the attendees pressed Potangaroa on which was the church for the MƒÅori, he retired to his nearby residence for three days of fasting, meditation, and prayer. Potangaroa reconvened the meeting on March 16 and announced that he had received knowledge of a coming church for the MƒÅori: \\"There is a religious denomination coming for us; perhaps it will come from there, perhaps it will emerge here. ... [T]here will be a time when a religion will emerge for you and I and the MƒÅori people.\\"Bronwyn Elsmore (1989).

(2000). Voyages of Faith: Explorations in Mormon Pacific History (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University) pp. 107‚Äì126. The covenant predicted that 1881 would be the \\"day of the fulness\\", 1882 would be a \\"year of the sealing\\", 1883 would be a \\"year of great faith\\", and that through these events the MƒÅori \\"will learn of the Scepter of Judah ... of the Kingdom of Heaven [and] of the sacred church with a large wall surrounding.\\" The covenant was sealed in a monument at the Te Ore Ore Marae. Claimed fulfillments of the prophecy =Mormonism= Shortly after uttering his prophecy, Potangaroa died. Later that same year, missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made initial contacts with individuals from NgƒÅti Kahungunu. Some of the Maori who converted to Mormonism believed that the coming of the Mormon missionaries was a fulfillment of Potangaroa's prophecy. Potangaroa's \\"day of the fulness\\" was identified as the missionaries bearing the \\"fulness of the Gospel\\"; the \\"year of the sealing\\" was identified as the time the MƒÅori learned of the Latter-day Saint sealing ordinances; and the \\"sacred church with a large wall surrounding\\" was identified as the Salt Lake Temple, which is located on Temple Square, surrounded by a high wall. It was also pointed out by believers that the Mormon missionaries had come in pairs from \\"the rising sun\\" (the United States, to the east), that the missionaries taught the NgƒÅti Kahungunu in the MƒÅori language in their own homes, and that they raised their arms when they prayed.R. Lanier Britsch, ‚ÄúMaori Traditions and the Mormon Church,‚Äù New Era, June 1981, p. 38. By 1883 ‚Äî Potangaroa's \\"year of great faith\\" ‚Äî hundreds of NgƒÅti Kahungunu had joined the LDS Church in the Wairarapa. An apostle of the LDS Church would later claim that by 1921, the fortieth anniversary of Potangaroa's prophecy, only MƒÅori from NgƒÅti Kahungunu had joined the LDS Church and received temple ordinances, and that MƒÅori from other tribes began receiving these sealing ordinances only after the forty- year \\"covenant\\" of Potangaroa had been fulfilled. =Others= Other religious groups that have been seen as fulfillments of the prophecy include the Ratana church, founded by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana; the Ringatu church, founded by Te Kooti; and the Church of the Seven Rules of Jehovah, founded by Simon Patete.

Its geographic coordinates are 5¬∞ 58‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ north, 7¬∞ 13‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ east. History The name Umunze was derived from the name of the originator \\"Nze\\" meaning the descendant of Nze in about 1476 during the time of extreme drought. Nze Izo Ezema was a farmer and hunter from ohafia near Arochukwu in the present day Abia State. He wandered the forest of his normal hunting and discoveries when he came across a very fertile land full of arable crops and he liked it. He settled and was very comfortable considering the weather and other climatic factors. He went back to his father and told him about his new home and also ask for wives. His father saw his behaviour and equipped him with necessities. He was given a mother shrine that has a stream known as Izo mmiri (the present Izo in the eke izo square) with two wives and a slave to the Izo. He settled first at Akpu Mgbatiri Okpa situated at Umuizo today. His wives Mrs Lolo and Ijendu. Lolo gave birth to 7 sons and 1 daughter and Ijendu had 1 son. Izo was Nze's father's name in Ohahia: Ezema was the family village name in Ohafia. Lolo gave birth to 7 sons and 1 daughter: #Nso- the descendants that formed Nsogwu. #Ugwu (Ojimgba)- the descendants that formed Ugwunano. #Uragu- the descendants that formed Lomu. #Ishingwu- the descendants that formed Ubaha. #Cheke- the descendants that formed Ururo. #Okpontu- the descendants that formed Ozara. #Diala- the descendants that formed Amuda. The daughter was married to an immigrant from Isunjaba in the present day Imo State. He became a neighbor to Nze and now the present Isulo (Umunze treats any girl from Isulo as Ada in any ceremony till today). Ijendu the first wife born one child; Dara (1st son), who is the father and founder of Eziagu, a neighboring town, after a family problem. War separated the two wives after the death of Nze that made Dara (the first son of Nze) to demand absolute control of the empire but war was waged by the combined forces of his half brothers and they forced him to move out of the empire and enter into Agu which is called IKPA according to Umunze language. Dara blessed with many children which formed the origin of Eziagu, he settled in the western part of the area. The slave that came with Nze was blessed by Nze but when he died and he was regarded as the father since he takes care of the entire kingdom after the death of Nze Izo Ezema. He became the present Umuizo where the entire Umunze gathered. All the villages have unique features: * Nsogwu forbids Dog and cannot be charmed when under the guide of nzu ngene. * Ugwunano forbids Hyena (Edi) * Lomu are guided by a police incarnated [Ngene Ojii] * Ubaha have the ability to lay and cleanse Charms on Farmland (Iwa Ogboro) * Ozara forbids Snail * Ururo ......... * Amuda These 7 sons settled at different locations which today formed a town called Umunze. The sons as you see today formed the seven villages we are today. There are many towns that migrated to join Umunze and form the town. A good example is parts of (Umualaoma) Isuokpu when the famous wars with Izuogu and Iheme (notorious inglorious slave trader and murderer from Arochukwu and Awka respectively) who they hosted benevolently and innocently and who stabbed Isuokpu people at the back by going to bring mercenaries from Abam to fight the Isuokpu in order that Izuogu and Iheme could take their land and settle at the time of abolition of slave trade by the British. Parts of Isieke and Obinohia people in Umuallaoma who migrated to Umunze to escape one type of punishment or the other are now part and parcel of Umunze. Ihite Umuenze (now Ihite) is rich in people from Umualaoma who ran from wars and humiliations from punishments from other types of deed or the other. One powerful man from Isuokpu (Umualaoma) called Ezerioha Udensi (father of Ezeagwula Ezerioha) of Obiokwara (Umudim), Obinihu was responsible for keeping the dangerously advancing Aros and their slaves in a \\"fight of life for land\\" in check. He organized Isuokpu, Umunze and Ihite people and neighbours to form a powerful militia group that restricted the advance of the Aros from Okigwe area. At the same time Ezerioha Udensi charismatically encouraged some communities in the present Okigwe and Orlu Divisions to allocate the Aros some land since the Aros and their slaves could not go to nowhere having been blocked at Okigwe by the white man who ensured that slave trade was stopped. Using this strategy, Ezerioha Udensi stopped the numerous wars and guerrilla warfare against the Aros and ensured the survival of many indigenous communities and that the Aros did not reach Umunze. Umunze maintains a special relationship with the Obiokwara Obinihu people, shown by exchange of goodwill at Obi Ezerioha in Isuokpu masquerade ceremonies and at Nkwo Umunze or palace of Abalikete (up to Ugochukwu reign) at Okuka and other ceremonies. The neighbors of Umunze are Umualaoma in Imo State; Aro Ndizuogu in Imo State; Eziagu, Isulo, Ezira, Ihite, Ogbunka, Umuchu, Nneato in Abia State, Umuomaku and Nawfija. Its people are mainly farmers and traders. The traditional ruler is called Abalikete and its people Nze, hence the name \\"Umunze\\". Villages in Umunze The seven villages in Umunze are: *Nsogwu *Ugwunano *Lomu *Ubaha *Ururo *Ozara *Amuda Traditional ruler The current traditional ruler is Chief Promise Eze, Abilikete II of Umunze. He became the new ruler after the death of Abilikete I, Chief MN Ugochukwu. Before Chief M N Ugochukwu, Chief S.I. Onyido( Agutagburuibeya ) is the Native Authority and he ruled Umunze for many years. The kingship is rotational, among the villages, and every male is eligible to contest. Notable people *Emeka Sibeudu (Former deputy Governor Anambra State, Nigeria). Culture and education Umunze is home of the Nkpokiti International Cultural Dance Group, a group of skilled Atilogwu dancers, Igba egwurugwu masquerade/dancers, Nkwo Umunze and the Federal College of Education (Technical) which has been upgraded to award Degrees.

One species has been described, T. gobiensis. It lived in the Maastrichtian stage at the end of the Late Cretaceous period, some 70 million years ago. It is known from fossils collected from the Nemegt Formation of Gobi, south Mongolia. The fossils include only the holotype which are pieces of a crushed right forelimb. These pieces include a nearly complete right carpometacarpus, two phalanges, the radiale and ulnare of the wrist, and a fragment of the distal right humerus. The catalog number of these fossils are given multiple times as PIN 4499-1, but they are listed as PIN 44991-1 on page 3, where the holotype is formally listed. This is probably a misprint. The fossils were collected at the Gurilyn tsav locality, northwest corner of Umnogobi Aimak, Mongolia. They are in the collection The genus name Teviornis is the Greek masculine word for bird combined with the name of Victor Tereschenko, the Paleontologist at the PIN who discovered the specimen. Gobiensis refers to the harsh Gobi Desert in which the fossil was found. The fossils are in the collection of the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. Teviornis was described by Kurochkin, et al.Kurochkin, Evgeny V., Dyke, Gareth J., Karhu, Alexandr A. (2002) \\"A New Presbyornithid Bird (Aves, Anseriformes) from the Late Cretaceous of Southern Mongolia\\" \\"American Museum Novitates\\" December 27, 2002, Number 3866, 11pp. as a member of the Presbyornithidae. These were stilt-legged, Anseriform, waterfowl which are extinct, but which flourished during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. If Teviornis does belong to the Presbyornithidae then, together with Vegavis from Antarctica, there is evidence that relatives of today's waterfowl already were widespread and highly apomorphic by the end of the Mesozoic. A review of Kurochkin et al. was performed by Clarke and Norell in 2004. They concluded that some of the characters used by Kurochkin et al. to assign T. gobiensis to the Anseriformes, such as an unbowed metacarpal III, are plesiomorphies which are primitive for Avialae and also retained in some members of Ornithurae. They found that the remaining characters used by Kurochkin et al. also had wider distribution than was assumed, or had an incompletely studied distribution. Moreover, Clarke et al. found no synapomorphies of Aves (sensu Gauthier), Neognathae, or Galloanseres, preserved in PIN 4499-1. thus, they conclude, Teviornis cannot be assigned with any confidence to the Presbyornithidae.Clarke, Julia A., Norell, Mark A.

Buffalo Creek is located in west-central Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Because the stream flows through several small farms, Buffalo Creek primarily serves agriculture purposes with segments used for livestock watering.  History  Buffalo Creek and its eponymous hollow were named so during the eighteenth century due to the abundant populations of buffalo in their vicinity. In 1755 at the onset of the French and Indian War, Fort Forman was constructed by Captain William Forman near the banks of Buffalo Creek, and the stream served as the fort's source of water. A historical highway marker along West Virginia Route 28 marks the approximate location of the stockade fort.  Headwaters and course  The stream's headwaters lie along the eastern flanks of South Branch Mountain southwest of Three Churches. From its source, Buffalo Creek meanders in a southwest direction along the forested foot of South Branch Mountain. The stream winds a northwesterly path through a gorge that leads it through the Buffalo Hollow in South Branch Mountain. It is through this hollow that Buffalo Creek parallels Buffalo Hollow Road (West Virginia Secondary State Route 28/1) until its intersection with West Virginia Route 28.

In May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter of Louise Fresco, an Assistant Director General of FAO. In her letter, the widely respected Dr Fresco criticised Diouf's management style: \\"I am sad that you have isolated yourself so much from most senior managers. Combined with a lack of transparency in decision making, you have stimulated a culture of silence, rumors and even fear.\\" Furthermore, she stated that \\"the Organisation has been unable to adapt to a new era\\", that \\"our contribution and reputation have declined steadily\\" and \\"its leadership has not proposed bold options to overcome this crisis\\".Resignation letter of Louise Fresco, ADG, FAO, Guardian Unlimited, 14 May 2006 In 2010, a so-called whistleblowing book was published on Amazon.com under a fictional name by a former staff member of FAO. It purported to describe the management methods and the state of the organization at the time of his departure. At the request of FAO officials attacked in the book, a legal action was initiated to protect the reputation of those concerned; the action was later dismissed on procedural grounds. These are the links to these most relevant documents: * When FAO scores only 27 points in Transparency... * Independent Evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organisation * Andrew Mitchel DFID's Head about FAO's performance Interfaith activities In 2009, Diouf took part in a special synod for Africa organized by the Catholic Church in Rome, even though he was a Muslim. The synod discussed several pastoral issues that are not directly related to religion, and which involve cooperation between the Catholic Church and the United Nations, such as food security, the status of African health care, and attempts to solve conflicts and achieve peace on the continent.La Croix article Decorations =Foreign honours= * 60px Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Africa (Liberia, 1977) * 60px Officer of the Legion of Honour (France, 1978) * 60px Officer of the Order of Academic Palms (France, 1979) * 60px Grand Officer of the Order of Valour (Cameroon, 1995) * 60px Commander of the Order of Merit (Central African Republic, 1995) * 60px Commander of the National Order of the Ivory Coast (Ivory Coast, 1995) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (Lithuania, 1996) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of Merit for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Spain, 1996) * 60px Medal of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (Uruguay, 1996) * 60px Commander of the Order of the Star of Anjouan (Comoros, 1997) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of May (Argentina, 1998) * 60px Order of Solidarity (Cuba, 1998) * 60px Order of the Grand Star of Djibouti (Djibouti, 1998) * 60px Commander of the Legion of Honour (France, 1998) * 60px Grand Cordon of the Honorary Order of the Yellow Star (Suriname, 1998) * 60px 1st Class the Order of Henri Pittier (Venezuela, 1998) * 60px 1st Class the Order of the Dragon Plant (Cape Verde, 2000) * 60px 1st Class of the Order of the Two Niles (Sudan, 2000) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of the Quetzal (Guatemala, 2001) * 60px National Order of Merit, Cooperation and Development (Guinea-Bissau, 2001) * 60px Commander of the Order of Saint-Charles (Monaco, 12 October 2002)Nomination by Sovereign Ordonnance n¬∞15534 of 12 October 2002 (French) * 60px Order of the Golden Fleece (Georgia, 2003) * 60px Commander of the National Order of Merit (Mauritania, 2003) * 60px Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the White Elephant (Thailand, 2003) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa (Panama, 2004) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of the Golden Heart (Philippines, 2004) * 60px Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence (Jordan, 2005) * 60px Commander of the National Order of Madagascar (Madagascar, 2005) * 60px Commander of the National Order of Mali (Mali, 2005) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross (Brazil, 2006) * 60px Grand Cross of the Order pro merito Melitensi (Sovereign Military Order of Malta, 2006) * 60px Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (Hungary, 2007) * 60px Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (Japan, 29 April 2012)Âπ≥Êàê24Âπ¥Êò•„ÅÆÂ§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫ÂèôÂã≤ 2012 List of the Awarded foreigners References Category:1938 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Serer diplomats Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Members of the National Assembly (Senegal) Category:Senegalese diplomats Category:Food and Agriculture Organization officials Category:Permanent Representatives of Senegal to the United Nations Category:People from Saint-Louis, Senegal Category:Commandeurs of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Commander's Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (civil) Category:Commanders of the National Order of Mali Category:Commanders of the Order of Saint-Charles Category:Grand Cordons of the Honorary Order of the Yellow Star Category:Grand Cordons of the Order of Independence (Jordan) Category:Grand Cordons of the Order of the Rising Sun Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of May Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Golden Heart Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Quetzal Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Southern Cross Category:Recipients of the National Order of the Ivory Coast Category:Recipients of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Georgia) Category:Recipients of the Order of Valour Category:Senegalese officials of the United Nations ","title":"Jacques Diouf"},{"id":"13863868","text":"David Olson Ulrich (born 1953) is a university professor, author, speaker, management coach, and management consultant.

It tells the story of an aspiring writer who is haunted by the ghost she is investigating. Plot Anna, a mystery writer, goes to Jeruk Purut Cemetery to look for information about the cemetery's legendary ghost, the headless pastor. After she begins writing, she is haunted by the pastor. Fearing for her life, she gives her notes to her fan, the high school student Airin (Angie); not long afterwards she is killed. Airin sees Anna's writing as her road to becoming a famous writer herself, and goes to Jeruk Purut with her friends Nadine (Sheila Marcia Joseph) and Valen (Samuel Z Heckenbucker) to find the ghost. After circling the cemetery seven times, an act thought to call the ghost, they go home. Not long afterwards, Airin is visited by the ghost, who warns her that if she continues Anna's writing then she and her friends and family will suffer; Airin chooses to continue writing about the ghost. Soon Airin's mother and friends begin experiencing accidents. Nadine is hit on the head by an exploding gas cylinder, while Valen is chased by a kuntilanak named Lasmi, eventually running into electric wires. While Airin is paying her respects to him in the hospital with Nadine and Cessa (Valia Rahma), Nadine becomes possessed by the ghost, knocks Cessa out, and attempts to strangle Airin. Airin escapes and runs into the morgue, with the possessed Nadine following her. Nadine is stabbed in the chest by Cessa just before she can kill Airin, dying; however, the ghost still attempts to kill Airin. Airin eventually learns the truth. Years before, a young man had attempted to rape Lasmi, the servant of a pastor; when the pastor tried to stop it, the man killed both him and Lasmi. The man then put on the pastor's clothes to fool the locals but was eventually caught and decapitated, later becoming a ghost. Production The story for Hantu Jeruk Purut was inspired by the \\"Hantu Jeruk Purut\\" urban legend in South Jakarta, which had circulated for several decades. The urban legend deals with sightings of a headless ghost around Jeruk Purut cemetery. The legend holds that the ghost only reveals itself to odd-numbered groups of people. Before production, the cast and crew went to Jeruk Purut to request the ghost's permission to shoot the film. While at the cemetery, two of those present, an actress named Yuni and a reporter from TV7, fainted. After they were diagnosed by a local kyai as having been possessed, those present attempted to communicate with the spirit. Receiving no response, the kyai told the crew to offer cigars, chicken eggs, palm sugar, and coffee to the spirits in glass containers before commencing filming. Filming took place in numerous locations in Jakarta and the surrounding area, including an abandoned hospital and houses. According to Joseph, while filming she experienced several strange happenings. She recalled that she and Angie saw the spirit of a child appear suddenly while filming in Ciawi, Bogor. While drawing the scissors to film the stabbing scene, Joseph lost control and released them; the scissors flew and struck Angie on the left temple. Hantu Jeruk Purut was Joseph's first horror film. She later commented that it was extremely tiring. Reception Hantu Jeruk Purut premiered at the Planet Hollywood in Jakarta on 29 November 2006. Audiences filled the 1195-seat theatre, requiring an additional showing. It received a wider release in Indonesia and Malaysia on 30 November that year. Dwita, writing in a review for Suara Karya, said that Hantu Jeruk Purut gave her goosebumps, with the sound, visuals, and plot deserving a thumbs up. However, Nur Hasan, writing for Detik.com, said that the cemetery background seemed fake, made to appear overly dark and gloomy, with the suspense lacking as the ghost was shown from the start. Benny Benke, writing for Suara Merdeka, said that the film left the impression that novelists are the professionals most-hated by ghosts, and the actors' performances were \\"nothing special\\".

E. walkeri (specimen PO 4825) was originally placed in Enantiornis, but the description of the type species E. nessovi (PO 4819), showed that it was not congeneric with the South American Enantiornis, which makes far more sense considering biogeography and age. The two species are named after famous paleontologists: Lev Alexandrovich Nesov (1947‚Äì1995) and Cyril Alexander Walker. These were all smallish birds, maybe 15‚Äì20 cm long in life, except E. walkeri which was probably more than 25 cm long. Since only the coracoids are known, the phylogenetic position of these taxa is somewhat unresolved. While they do resemble the more advanced Enantiornithes more than they do any other bird, confirmation of their placement with Euenantiornithes would still require more material.

B. Joshua, is a Nigerian charismatic pastor, televangelist and philanthropist. He is the leader and founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN), a Christian megachurch that runs the Emmanuel TV television station from Lagos. Joshua is known for his popularity across Africa and Latin America and his social media presence with 3,500,000 fans on Facebook. His YouTube channel, Emmanuel TV, has over 1,000,000 YouTube subscribers and is the world‚Äôs most viewed Christian ministry on the platform. Described as the \\"Oprah of evangelism\\" and \\"YouTube's most popular Pastor\\", He has been awarded various accolades, notably receiving the Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) by the Nigerian government in 2008 and being voted the Yoruba man of the decade by Pan-Yoruba media outlet Irohin-Odua. He has been called one of Africa's 50 most influential people by Pan-African magazines The Africa Report and New African Magazine , according to Forbes, Joshua was Nigeria's third- richest pastor, although the claim was immediately denied in a statement by the church. He is known to be controversial, and was even 'blacklisted' by the government of Cameroon in 2010. Biography According to Joshua's official biography, unusual circumstances surrounded his birth. He says that he spent 15 months in his mother's womb and narrowly avoided death after a quarry explosion near his house sent rocks through its roof just seven days after his birth. It is also alleged that Joshua's birth was 'prophesied' 100 years prior. Joshua, then known as Balogun Francis, attended St. Stephen's Anglican Primary School in Arigidi Akoko, Nigeria, between 1971 and 1977, but failed to complete one year of secondary school education. In school, he was known as \\"small pastor\\" because of his love for the Bible. He worked in various casual jobs after his schooling had ended, including carrying chicken waste at a poultry farm. He organised Bible studies for local children and attended evening school during this period. Joshua attempted to join the Nigerian military but was thwarted due to a train breakdown that left him stranded en route to the military academy.  The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN)  Joshua wrote that in a heavenly vision he had received divine anointing and a covenant from God to start his ministry. Following this, Joshua founded the ministry organisation The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN). According to the organisation, more than 15,000 members attend its weekly Sunday service; visitors from outside Nigeria are accommodated in the accommodation blocks constructed at the church. The Guardian reported that The SCOAN attracts more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. The SCOAN's popular services have also resulted in an enormous boost for local businesses and hoteliers. Despite Joshua's popularity, the church only has a branch in Ghana, Joshua stating that \\"it is not yet time\\" for him to have branches worldwide as \\"it will be too much for my character\\". =Religious tourism= The SCOAN has been described as ‚ÄúNigeria‚Äôs biggest tourist attraction‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most visited destination by religious tourists in West Africa,‚Äù with thousands of foreigners flocking to attend the church's weekly services. Figures released by the Nigerian Immigration Service indicated that six out of every ten foreign travellers coming into Nigeria are bound for The SCOAN, a fact discussed in Zimbabwean parliament when addressing the economic potentials of religious tourism. This Day newspapers reported that ‚Äúabout two million local and inbound tourists‚Äù visit The SCOAN annually. The church's popularity has led to an increase in flight routes to Lagos from several African countries in 2013. =Potential relocation to Israel= Joshua's contribution to Nigeria's religious tourism was highlighted when the cleric hinted at the possibility of relocating his ministry to Israel during a Sunday service. The announcement proved controversial with several prominent Nigerians urging him to remain in the country, citing the economic setbacks Nigeria would likely experience through his potential relocation.  Purported healings and miracles  SCOAN claims regular occurrences of divine miracles. Several hundred Nigerians and international visitors come to the SCOAN each week to register for the prayer lines where the visitors are prayed over by Joshua. SCOAN has published numerous videos claiming to document the healing of incurable disabilities and illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, blindness and open wounds. Spiritual healing at The SCOAN has been the subject of several media reports, including a mention in Time Magazine, an Associated Press interview and an article by Foreign Policy detailing the tendency of Nigerians to seek 'spiritual' help due to insufficient medical facilities. A huge debate was stirred within Nigeria when the father of abducted school girl Ese Oruru stated his intention to take his daughter to T.B. Joshua for 'prayers' following her release. Similarly, a leaked report stating the intention of Nigeria's embattled former petroleum minister Diezani Alison-Madueke to visit Joshua for 'spiritual support' in her battle against breast cancer elicited controversy. = Anointing Water = Many have also claimed to be healed through 'Anointing Water' that has been prayed over by Joshua and given to those who are unable to physically attend his church in Lagos. Others claim they were protected from deadly incidents because they had the water with them. In 2013, four people died in a stampede in Joshua's Ghanaian branch when an unadvertised service where it was being distributed drew huge crowds far beyond the churches capacity, bringing Ghana's capital city Accra almost to a standstill. Joshua also made headlines when he claimed his Anointing Water could cure the deadly disease Ebola. He subsequently sent 4,000 bottles of the water alongside a cash gift of $50,000 to the Ebola-stricken nation of Sierra Leone. This came after Lagos State Health officials visited Joshua, requesting him to publicly discourage Ebola victims from visiting his church for prayers. A Sierra Leonean politician later claimed the water helped stop the spread of the disease and cured several Ebola victims.  Alleged exorcisms  SCOAN is also known for the purported \\"deliverance\\" of those allegedly possessed by evil spirits during its services. Strange occurrences have been reported during these deliverance prayers, including the case of a South African girl who allegedly 'cried blood' and a Liberian man who began behaving 'like a dog'. A young man allegedly delivered from a 'homosexual demon' at The SCOAN also attracted widespread media attention, as did the 'transformation' of a Paraguayan transvestite. After 'deliverance', those involved often confess the atrocities which the 'evil spirit' allegedly pushed them to engage in, such as prostitution, armed robbery, internet fraud and human trafficking. =Celebrity 'Deliverances'= Ghanaian human rights lawyer Kwabla Senanu claimed that he was delivered from a spiritual problem. Similarly, Ghanaian musician Denise Williams said she was delivered from a demon that had pushed her to become a drug addict and suicidal. Veteran Nigerian Nollywood Actress Camilla Mberekpe was also said to have been delivered at The SCOAN. Popular Nollywood actor Jim Iyke also said he received deliverance at The SCOAN, the video of the event subsequently going viral. A video of Kenyan Olympic athlete Mercy Cherono receiving 'deliverance' through Joshua's prayers attracted widespread attention in Kenya. She subsequently testified in the company of her husband how the 'evil spirit' had negatively affected her young marriage and career. Foreign visits He has travelled to Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Paraguay to hold 'crusades'. He also visited Israel to receive a humanitarian award from ZAKA and visit biblical sites. His 'Miracle Crusade' in Cali, Colombia in July 2014 was allegedly attended by 100,000 people and held in the Estadio Ol√≠mpico Pascual Guerrero. He travelled to the iconic Estadio Azteca in Mexico which was allegedly attended by 200,000 people over two days in May 2015. Joshua's two- day visit to Estadio Monumental \\"U\\" in Lima, Peru, attracted nearly 100,000 in September 2016, making headlines in local Peruvian media. In August 2017, Joshua held a Crusade in Paraguay at Estadio Defensores del Chaco. His visit caused a media storm when the Paraguayan parliament approved that the cleric be awarded with the ‚ÄòNational Order of Merit‚Äô, the countries highest honour usually reserved only for its own citizens. Testimonies from those who alleged they were healed through Joshua's prayers at the crusade made headlines in local media. =Nazareth= In June 2019, Joshua held a two-day event at the Amphitheatre of Mount Precipice in Nazareth, Israel - the historic hometown of Jesus Christ. The event was the subject of intense media scrutiny. Local religious officials told their followers to boycott the event and several small protests were held calling for its cancellation. However, an estimated 15,000 travelled from over 50 nations to attend the event, significantly boosting local tourism. Humanitarian work A Forbes blogger estimated that Joshua has spent $20 million on \\"education, healthcare and rehabilitation programs for former Niger Delta militants\\". There is also a rehabilitation programme for militants from Nigeria's volatile Niger Delta region, repentant armed robbers and sex workers who came to the church for 'deliverance'. =Community support= Joshua has come to the aid of several communities in distress, notably providing two transformers to a local community after theirs was burned beyond repair. He donated over N26m towards restoring electricity and putting an end to over two years of power outage in four councils in Akoko area of Ondo State. The cleric has additionally made several large donations to the police force in Nigeria, Ghana and Colombia. =Scholarships= The SCOAN has a 'scholarship program' which caters for the academic needs of students in their thousands, ranging from primary to tertiary education. In 2012, Joshua sponsored a Nigerian student doing a PhD in Oxford University, with Nigerian media reporting she received ¬£100,000 from the church. He also gave a scholarship to a young Motswana to study at Harvard Law School in America. =Disaster relief= After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Joshua sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area, establishing a field hospital called 'Clinique Emmanuel'. He additionally sent support to nations such as Philippines, India and Ghana in the wake of varying natural disasters. The 'Emmanuel TV Team' also assisted victims of the earthquake that struck the nation of Ecuador in April 2016, providing over $500,000 worth of humanitarian aid. =Education= Joshua funded the building and running of a school in Lahore, Pakistan named 'Emmanuel School'. He also rebuilt a school in a rural area destroyed by the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, travelling to Ecuador for the opening of the school in June 2017. =Support for migrants and deportees= Several groups of Nigerians attempting illegal travel to Europe through Libya have been supported at The SCOAN following their deportation from the North African nation with only the clothes on their backs. Stories of the harsh conditions they encountered and Joshua's subsequent assistance made headlines in several local newspapers. =Sports= In 2009, Joshua started a football club, My People FC, as part of efforts to help the youth. Two members of the team played for Nigeria's Golden Eaglets in the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, who apparently lived in The SCOAN for several years, was Nigeria's top-scorer and the tournament's MVP. Emmanuel and his colleague Ogenyi Onazi signed professional contracts with SS Lazio, Onazi a key player for the Nigerian Senior Team, the Super Eagles. WBO International Light Middleweight boxing champion King Davidson Emenogu said that Joshua has financially supported him throughout his career and purportedly prophesied that he would be a world boxing champion. =Reconciliation efforts= Joshua was involved in the meeting of the family of the late president of Liberia, Samuel Doe, with the former warlord Prince Yormie Johnson who was responsible for Doe's death. During this meeting the family publicly forgave Johnson who said it was through Joshua's prayers that he stopped drinking alcohol and turned to Christianity. The cleric has also played a prominent role in reconciling broken homes and restoring families torn apart by false accusations. =Humanitarian awards= In recognition of his humanitarian activities, he was awarded a National Honour by the Nigerian government in 2008 as well as receiving a letter of appreciation from the United Nations. He was further honoured as an Ambassador of Peace by the Arewa Youth Forum, a predominantly Muslim organisation, as well as being recognised with an 'award of excellence' by ZAKA, Israel's primary rescue and recovery voluntary service. Claimed prophecies SCOAN claims that Joshua has successfully predicted events in the lives of individuals who attend his church services as well as worldwide events, including a purported prophecy of Michael Jackson's death, and the outcome of two African Cup of Nations (AFCON) final matches, which were won by Zambia and Nigeria respectively. He has been voted by the public among the most famous prophets. His prophecy about the impending death of an African president was widely reported in African press. Joshua's followers believe the prophecy concerned the former president of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika who died in 2012, aged 78. False rumors spread using Joshua's name are known to have caused widespread panic in communities, affected sporting events, music concerts and led people to stop using social networks. When Hamza Al-Mustapha, the Chief Security Officer of former Nigerian President Sani Abacha, was released after eleven years of imprisonment, his first port of call was to Joshua's church in acknowledgement of a 'prophecy' the cleric allegedly gave him when Abacha was still in power. Critics argue that Joshua's predictions are too vague. = Alleged MH370 prophecy = SCOAN released a video claiming that TB Joshua predicted the Malaysia Airlines MH370 event. The prophecy received a lot of attention on social media and its accompanying YouTube video amassed over 1 million views. = Terrorist attacks = Several terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS, Al- Qaeda affiliates and Al-Shabaab militants have allegedly been predicted by Joshua, including the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Garissa University College attack in Kenya, the Ouagadougou hotel siege in Burkina Faso and the 2016 Brussels Bombings. It is also claimed that he predicted the Boston bombing attacks in America. = Ghana terror attack = Joshua's alleged prophecy in April 2016 that an impending terror attack would befall Ghana made national headlines in the West African nation and led the national police to issue a statement calling for the general public to be calm and vigilant. 600 foreigners reportedly cancelled their visits to Ghana in the wake of the statement. Days later, a captured Malian terrorist confessed that his group had planned to target Ghana. =US election prophecy= Joshua incorrectly predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 US election. After this prophecy failed to materialise, with Donald Trump winning the election, Joshua stated that he was referring to Clinton's win in the popular vote and any misinterpretation was due to a lack of \\"spiritual understanding\\". =2017 Zimbabwe coup= A video of Joshua predicting \\"the military\\" of an undisclosed Southern African nation embarrassing, killing or capturing \\"a President or Vice-President ... or the First Lady of that nation‚Äö‚Äù surfaced on social media after the statement, which was made and recorded in August 2014, was interpreted as a prophecy of the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'√©tat against Robert Mugabe. = Coronavirus = Joshua claimed that the COVID-19 would disappear globally on March 27th, 2020. Influence in African Politics A BBC Africa journalist once questioned whether Joshua was ‚Äúthe most powerful man in Africa‚Äù due to his alleged influence in the African political sphere. =Ghana= Days after the late John Atta Mills became President of Ghana in 2009, his first port of call was Joshua's church for a thanksgiving service where he revealed the cleric had accurately ‚Äòprophesied‚Äô his ascension to power and specific details relating to his narrow victory over Nana Akufo- Addo. Joshua was a regular visitor to Ghana during Mill's early presidency and allegedly organised prayer warriors to be praying in Osu Castle. =Malawi= Joshua's much-publicised prophecy concerning the death of Malawian President Bingu Mutharika garnered intense media attention and was subsequently the subject of a Malawian government inquiry as his successor, Joyce Banda, is a devotee of the cleric. Banda claimed Joshua's prayers healed her husband after he suffered a stroke and regularly visited Joshua in Nigeria while she was Head of State. =Tanzania= Joshua played the role of a peacemaker in the aftermath of the Tanzanian elections in 2015, visiting the country to meet and hold reconciliatory talks with President John Magufuli ‚Äì a member of his church ‚Äì and opposition leader Edward Lowassa. Commentators acknowledged his visit significantly reduced tensions in the country after the elections which the opposition party alleged were fraught with irregularities. =Liberia= Joshua was a key influence in former Liberian warlord Senator Prince Yormie Johnson‚Äôs decision to endorse the candidacy of George Weah for president in the 2017 Liberian elections. His endorsement came days after the two were spotted publicly together in The SCOAN, a visit that caused a media storm in Liberia. Weah's main opponent and former Vice President, Joseph Boakai, also allegedly requested to visit Joshua in lieu of the elections. Weah eventually won the election to become Liberia's 25th President. =South Sudan= In November 2019, Joshua visited South Sudan where he was received by President Salva Kiir Mayardit. He led Mayardit and his cabinet in prayers for peace at the nation‚Äôs Presidential Palace in Juba and called on leaders to overcome their differences in a message broadcast on South Sudan‚Äôs state television. In February 2020, South Sudan finally formed a unity government with peace brokered between Mayardit and rival leader Riek Machar. Emmanuel TV Emmanuel TV, the SCOAN television station, broadcasts 24/7. Its Sunday services are broadcast live. Joshua's programmes also air weekly on a number of local television stations across Africa. It debuted on DStv and GOtv in November 2015, as well as StarTimes in February 2016. In its profile on Joshua, the BBC described him as \\"Nigeria's best known televangelist\\". Emmanuel TV's motto is 'Changing lives, changing nations, changing the world.' The station is also known for its catch-phrase, ‚ÄòDistance Is Not A Barrier‚Äô, encouraging viewers to ‚Äòpray along‚Äô with T.B. Joshua by ‚Äòtouching the screen‚Äô. There are several claims of people receiving miraculous 'healing' through these prayers, including popular Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh who said Joshua's prayers ended her 14-year smoking addiction. Joshua has earned a reputation for not focusing on the 'Prosperity Gospel' and Emmanuel TV is known as one of the few Christian channels that does not engage in fundraising on air. YouTube channel Emmanuel TV's YouTube Channel has over 1,000,000 subscribers and 400 million views, making it the world‚Äôs most viewed Christian ministry on the platform. Google ranked one of Emmanuel TV's YouTube videos as the fourth most viewed clip ever within Nigeria. Criticism and controversy Joshua has many critics and is known to be controversial. =Relationship with other pastors= Joshua has been publicly condemned by several prominent pastors within Nigeria, his most vocal critic being Pastor Chris Okotie who described him as a 'son of the devil'. The Christian Association of Nigeria and Pentecostal Fellowship Of Nigeria have both acknowledged Joshua is not a member of either organisation and denounced him as an 'impostor'. Enoch Adeboye, David Oyedepo, Ayo Oritsejafor, Paul Adefarasin and Matthew Ashimolowo are among the pastors who publicly denounced Joshua, as did disgraced American megachurch leader Ted Haggard. =Blacklisted in Cameroon= He was 'blacklisted' by the government of Cameroon in 2010 and termed a 'son of the devil'. Rumours of a visit by Joshua to Zimbabwe in 2012 led to an intense national debate, culminating with pastors and politicians strongly objecting. =HIV deaths In London= In 2011, several media houses in UK reported at least three people in London with HIV died after they stopped taking life saving drugs on the advice of their pastors. The HIV prevention charity African Health Policy Network (AHPN) believed that The SCOAN \\"may\\" be one of those involved in such practices although the three in question have no demonstrable link to the SCOAN. The BBC quoted The SCOAN as saying \\"No, we do not ask people to stop taking their medication\\". =Private jet= On 14 September 2015, it was reported that Joshua \\"secretly purchased a $60 Million Gulfstream G550 Private Jet\\". These rumors were dismissed as false by a media aide of Joshua. =Boko Haram confession= A self-confessed member of the Islamic sect Boko Haram came to The SCOAN in March 2014, allegedly with plans to 'bomb' the church. According to him, it was Joshua's prayers that prevented the plan and later compelled him to confess. The subsequent clip of the confession went viral on YouTube and proved very controversial. A group known as the \\"Movement for Accountability and Good Governance\\", has called for the investigation of the incident based on the claims that were made. =Collapse of guesthouse= On 12 September 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN's premises in Lagos killing at least 115 people, 84 of them South Africans.TB Joshua Lagos church collapse: Many South Africans dead BBC Controversy has continued to swirl around the circumstances that led to the collapse, with the former Nigerian Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode alleging Nigeria's intelligence agencies ‚Äòblew up‚Äô the building. =Panama Papers= Nigeria's Premium Times newspaper stated that Joshua incorporated a company called Chillon Consultancy Limited in the British Virgin Islands in June 2006, based on reports stemming from the Panama Papers leak. Joshua immediately denied his involvement, stating on Facebook, \\"I am not a businessman and have no business whatsoever. What God has given me is more than enough.\\" =Threat by Muslim cleric= A prominent Nigerian Muslim cleric, Sheikh Hussaini Yusuf Mabera, threatened to drag Joshua to court for \\"describing Jesus Christ as God\\". Personal life Joshua is married to Evelyn Joshua. They have three children.

Its remains have been found in the People's Republic of China, in Chaomidianzi Formation rocks from around the Barremian-Aptian boundary, deposited 125 million years ago. Changchengornis was a close relative of the better-known Confuciusornis. In 1999 it was assigned to the Confuciusornithidae. The more pointed bill of Changchengornis might indicate a diet different from that of Confuciusornis. However, of Confuciusornis itself it is contested whether it were a fish eater, an omnivore, or a seed eater. Discovery In 1998 Ji Shuan and Luis Chiappe discovered among the many specimens of the National Geological Museum of China at Beijing assigned to Confuciusornis, an exemplar that seemed somewhat different. Subsequent preparation by the American Museum of Natural History showed that it indeed was a separate species, new to science. In 1999 Ji, Chiappe and Ji Qiang named the type species and only species of Changchengornis: Changchengornis hengdaoziensis. The generic name refers to the Great Wall of China, changcheng, and combines this with a Greek ·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπœÇ, ornis, \\"bird\\". The specific name refers to the geological Hengdaozi Member.Ji Q., Chiappe, L. and Ji S., 1999, \\"A new Late Mesozoic confuciusornithid bird from China\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 19(1): 1-7 The holotype specimen, GMV-2129, was found near the village of Jianshangou in Liaoning province, in the Jianshangou Beds of the Hengdaozi Member of the Yixian Formation, at the time seen as a separate Chaomidianzi Formation. It consists of a plate and counterplate, GMV-2129a/b, showing a largely complete and articulated but compressed and somewhat damaged skeleton. Much of the feathering has been preserved in an excellent state of preservation. Description Life restoration Changchengornis resembles its relative Confuciusornis.Chiappe, Luis M., Shu- An, Ji, Qiang, Ji, Norell, Mark A., 1999, \\"Anatomy and systematics of the Confuciusornithidae (Theropoda:Aves) from the Late Mesozoic of northeastern China\\", Bulletin of the American museum of Natural History N¬∞242 89 pp The type specimen is rather small, smaller than the smallest known specimens of Confuciusornis. Compared to the latter, Changchengornis had a beak that was more pointed, slightly hooked at the tip, proportionally shorter, and higher at the back.Mortimer, Michael (2004): The Theropod Database: Phylogeny of taxa . Retrieved 2013-MAR-02.) The deltopectoral crest of the humerus is not pierced. GMV-2129 also shows two elongated, ribbon-like tail feathers as found in some specimens of Confuciusornis, that are often considered to be the males. Also, the fossil gives the impression of a head tuft or crest being present; if so, the outline of its head must have borne an uncanny resemblance to today's Tauraco or turacos in general but it could also be an artefact of conservation.

Players have used it more and more often in One Day International and Twenty20 cricket matches, since it appeared in the early 21st century. The player makes the shot by positioning the body square-on with the ball, both feet pointing towards the bowler at a perpendicular angle. The player uses the bat to deflect the ball over the batsman's leg side shoulder, thus guiding the ball towards the fine leg region. The shot is considered unorthodox, and not usually included in coaching manuals and textbooks. Many purists suggest it is not a true, graceful cricketing shot. However, executed well, the paddle-scoop is useful‚Äîoften because it can be used on a delivery that is usually considered a good \\"line and length\\" delivery, and otherwise difficult to score runs on. Also, the area where the shot sends the ball is often not patrolled by a fielder‚Äîand since the bowler's pace on the ball (faster than the pace imparted by a batsman's hit) sends it to the boundary, fielders may still find it difficult to cover more than a couple of yards on either side of themselves to stop the ball, because of its momentum. This shot requires good hand-eye coordination and bravery, especially against faster bowlers‚Äîwhere a miss can not only result in the batsmen being dismissed. but the ball can injure the batsman if it hits his head. However, used occasionally as a calculated risk, the shot can frustrate the fielding side's captain, because positioning a fielder to stop a paddle scoop may present gaps and scoring opportunities in other areas. Marillier shot history The shot was developed by Zimbabwean batsman Dougie Marillier. In a triangular tournament in Australia with Zimbabwe, Australia and West Indies, Zimbabwe played their final match with Australia and Marillier got a chance in the team. He could hardly have had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored 303 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 to win the match in the final over, which was to be bowled by Glenn McGrath. Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath and flicked them over his shoulder to fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by two runs. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030511/ai_n12582503 Marillier continued to do reasonably well for the national side. In 2002 he \\"Marilliered\\" Zimbabwe to a famous win in India in a One Day International at Faridabad, India with 56 not out at the death, although this time he used the shot against Anil Kumble.http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss2512/25120280.htm Comparison with Dilscoop During 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament, Sri Lankan batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan mastered a similar shot to paddle scoop. Dilshan's success with a similar shot led Dilshan's shot being titled the \\"Dilscoop\\". The Dilscoop is different from the paddle scoop because Dilshan's scoop is played straight over the head of the wicketkeeper, rather than to one side of the wicketkeeper. Dilshan's teammates have said that they call the shot the \\"Starfish,\\" 'because a starfish has no brain'.[Sky TV's coverage of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20] See also *Dilscoop References Category:Batting (cricket) Category:Cricket terminology Category:Cricket captaincy and tactics ","title":"Paddle scoop"},{"id":"13864023","text":"More Fool Me may refer to: * More Fool Me, a song by the band Genesis released in 1973 on the album Selling England by the Pound * More Fool Me (memoir), the 2014 autobiography of Stephen Fry (his third) ","title":"More Fool Me"},{"id":"13864049","text":"The Raritan River Project was founded by the Edison Wetlands Association (EWA) in 1995 to protect human health, quality of life, and the environment against threats, including pollution, overdevelopment, and lack of public access to waterways.

It currently exists in two segments: a signed, locally maintained portion in the city of Burlington and the town of Colchester, and an unsigned, state-maintained portion within the town of Colchester. The southern terminus of the signed segment is at Pearl Street in downtown Burlington. Its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 2 and U.S. Route 7 in Colchester. The unsigned segment is little more than the southern leg of a wye connection between US 2 / US 7 and VT 2A. VT 127 was assigned in the early 1940s as a loop route off US 2 and US 7 through Burlington and southern Colchester, where it ended at the junction of Bay Road and US 2 / US 7\\\\. It was extended slightly eastward to VT 2A in 1950. The majority of the route in Burlington was moved onto a new limited-access highway‚Äînamed the Winooski Valley Parkway and also known as the Burlington Beltline‚Äîin the 1970s and 1980s. A later realignment in Colchester moved the signed northern terminus of VT 127 to the junction of Blakely/Severance Road and US 2 / US 7; however, the portion of VT 127 added in 1950 was left unchanged. As a result, the route now exists in two segments. Route description Route 127 heading northbound through Colchester as a two-lane roadway (West Lakeshore Drive) VT 127 begins at Pearl Street in the city of Burlington. The route heads north as a one-way couplet along North Champlain Street (northbound) and Park Street (southbound) through the Old North End of the city to Manhattan Drive. VT 127 northbound follows Manhattan Drive for one block west to Park Street, where both directions of VT 127 come together and turn onto a two-lane limited-access highway named the Winooski Valley Parkway and locally known as the Burlington Beltline. The route has one interchange with North Avenue and another with Plattsburgh Avenue, before reverting to an at-grade highway at the Winooski River. Now in Colchester, VT 127 heads north along Heineberg Drive and Prim Road to West Lakeshore Drive. It then travels east along the shoreline of Malletts Bay to Blakely Road, where it continues eastward onto Blakely to its northern terminus, as signed, at US 2 and US 7. However, another segment of VT 127 exists farther north in Colchester as the southern leg of the wye connection between US 2 / US 7 and VT 2A. This part of VT 127 is not signed as such; it is marked as \\"To VT 2A\\" from northbound US 2 and US 7 and \\"To VT 127\\" from northbound VT 2A. History Route 127 turns northward onto the Winooski Valley Parkway towards the Ethan Allen Homestead VT 127 was assigned in the early 1940s as a loop route off U.S. Route 2 and U.S. Route 7 between the city of Burlington and the village of Colchester by way of the Burlington Bay and Malletts Bay shorelines. A short, highway between US 2 / US 7 and VT 2A was added to the state highway system in 1950 as an extension of VT 127. VT 127 originally began at the junction of Pearl Street and Winooski Avenue in Burlington and followed Pearl Street, North Avenue, and Plattsburg Avenue through the city. A new limited-access highway, named the Burlington Beltline, was built ca. 1971 between Manhattan Drive and North Avenue near the Ethan Allen Homestead.National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed May 15, 2009. It was added to the state highway system in 1971 as a realignment of VT 127. The route now left Pearl Street at Park Street and followed Park north to the southern end of the new highway. Ownership and maintenance of the Burlington Beltline was transferred to the city of Burlington in 1980. An extension of the Beltline northwest to the Winooski River opened to traffic as part of VT 127 in the mid-1980s. VT 127 was later truncated to the junction of Pearl and Park Streets. In Colchester, VT 127 was initially routed on Heineberg Drive, Porters Point Road, Church Road, Lakeshore Drive, and Bay Road. The route was realigned through the town between 1982 and 2005 to follow Prim Road, a northward continuation of Heineberg Drive, to Lakeshore Drive, and to follow Blakely Road to US 2 and US 7, bypassing East Lakeshore Drive and Bay Road. The latter realignment severed the locally maintained portion of VT 127 from the state- maintained section to the north; however, the latter is still designated, though not signed, as part of VT 127. Future VT 127 has a proposed interchange with VT 289 near the Heineberg bridge in Colchester. Major intersections =Southern segment= =Northern segment= VT 127 Connector Vermont Route 127 Connector is an unsigned connector route between VT 127 and North Avenue in northern Burlington.

The competition carries a UCI rating of 2.2 (having also been rated 2.5 from 2002 to 2004) and is part of the UCI America Tour, which is one of six UCI Continental Circuits sponsored by the Union Cycliste Internationale, the sport's international governing body. The race is organized by the Federacion Nacional de Ciclismo de Guatemala. History The Vuelta a Guatemala, which has become the largest sporting event in the country in terms of spectator affluence, was first held in 1957. The winner of the first edition was local racer Jorge Surqu√©, and during the first four years, the competition was dominated by Guatemalan and Colombian participants. As of 2007, Colombia is the nation with the most wins all-time, with 21 general classification individual wins. From 1992 to 1996, five different Colombian participants took five consecutive titles, before local racer Luis Rodolfo Muj won in 1997, becoming the first Guatemalan to finish first since Edin Roberto Nova had won his second tour in 1988, and ending the longest drought of titles for his country. The winner of the 2004 edition of the race, Lizandro Ajc√∫, was disqualified afterwards for doping in what was the biggest doping case of the race‚Äôs history ‚Äì nine riders including the first four on the General classification returned positive A samples. In 2005, the tour was cancelled after Tropical Storm Stan's heavy rainfalls caused floods and mudslides which damaged infrastructure and caused 1500 deaths weeks before the race was due to begin. The LII edition of the race in 2011 was cancelled by the organizers shortly before the start of the race. Heavy rains during September and October damaged roads and paths, and the Guatemala Government, having concerns for life safety, decreed the cancellation as the infrastructure could not be restored in such a short period and re-scheduling of the event was not feasible due to the busy schedules of different participants. \\"Gobierno suspende la edici√≥n n√∫mero 52 de la Vuelta cicl√≠stica a Guatemala\\" \\"Se confirma la cancelaci√≥n de la 52 Vuelta a Guatemala\\" The event was then scheduled for May 13‚Äì20, 2012.

The single known species, Apsaravis ukhaana, lived about 78 million years ago, in the Campanian age of the Cretaceous period. Its fossilized remains were found in the Camel's Humps sublocality of the Djadokhta Formation, at Ukhaa Tolgod in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. They were collected in the 1998 field season by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences/American Museum of Natural History Paleontological Expeditions. It was described by Norell and Clarke (2001).Norell, Mark A., Clarke, Julia A. (2001). \\"Fossil that fills a critical gap in avian evolution\\". Nature Vol. 409 11 January 2001 pp.181-184. Its habitat was presumably very arid open landscape much like it is today, perhaps hotter still and with more (but nonetheless intermittent) rain. Permanent freshwater would have been scarce. Implications Apsaravis is important in avian paleontology. It has provided evidence that is directly relevant to at least four issues: = Sauriurae = The Sauriurae are a putative clade of primitive birds that includes Archaeopteryx, Confuciusornis, and Enantiornithes. It is thought by Feduccia and Martin to be phylogenetically separate from the Ornithurae and, thus, from modern birds. Apsaravis has features of both Sauriurae and Ornithurae. Apsaravis has several characters that place it near Aves (sensu Gauthier), including the presence of at least ten sacral vertebrae, a pubis and ischium that are closely appressed, distal pubes that do not touch, an 'obturator flange' on the ischium, loss of the cuppedicus muscle fossa on the ilium, a patellar groove on the distal femur, an anterior sternal keel, completely heterocoelus vertebrae, curved scapular shaft, and several features of the forelimb, ankle, and foot. Apsaravis also retains primitive characters shared with Enantiornithes and more basal theropods, including a narrow intercondylar groove and barrel-shaped condyles of the tibiotarsus, a dorsal fossa of the coracoid, into which the supracoracoideus nerve foramen opens, and several features of the humerus. This intermediate anatomy is evidence against the validity of the clade \\"Sauriurae\\".Clarke, Julia A., Norell, Mark A. (2002). \\"The morphology and phylogenetic position of Apsaravis ukhaana from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia\\". American Museum Novitates, No. 3387, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY. =Enantiornithine monophyly= In their cladistic analyses, Clarke and Norell (2002) found that Apsaravis had a mixture of primitive and advanced characters (described above in \\"Sauriurae\\") that removed most of the supporting characters for the clade Enantiornithes. Twenty-seven characters have been used to support enantiornithine monophyly, but Apsaravis brings the number down to only four. The discovery of further basal ornithurine fossils like Apsaravis could render the Enantiornithes paraphyletic. This would mean that, rather than a radiation of primitive birds separate from the radiation that led to modern birds, \\"enantiornithines\\" would actually be steps along the way to becoming modern birds. =Ecological bottle neck = Prior to the discovery of Apsaravis, most ornithurine birds had been found in marine, lacustrine, or littoral sediments. This led Feduccia (1996)Feduccia, Alan (1996). The origin and evolution of birds. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 420pp. and Martin (1983)Martin, Larry D. (1983). \\"The origin and early radiation of birds\\" pp.291-338 in Perspectives on Ornithology Brush, A.H., Clark, G.A. New York: Cambridge University Press to deduce that the ancestors of modern birds were restricted to aquatic environments, and that they were all basal members of the Charadriiformes. Because they believed that all such birds had a \\"shorebird ecology\\", they described this limited habitat as an \\"ecological bottleneck\\", with all other ecological niches being dominated by enantiornithine birds instead. Apsaravis, however, was found in a sand dune environment, and it has no obviously aquatic anatomical adaptations, giving clear evidence that not all early members of Ornithurae were shorebirds. = Automatic extension of the manus = Apsaravis is the most basal bird that possesses an extensor process. This is a bony projection on metacarpal I that develops at the insertion of the m.extensor metacarpi radialis muscle and the propatagial ligaments. This anatomy functions to \\"automate\\" extension of the manus during extension of the forelimb in Aves. This is a key function for the flight stroke of modern birds. Phylogenetic position Clarke and Norell (2002) found that Apsaravis is the most basal ornithurine bird, but more advanced than Enantiornithes and Patagopteryx. Subsequent cladistic analysis indicates that it and the more advanced Palintropus - long believed to be a modern bird -, and perhaps Ambiortus with which the preceding two had occasionally been allied, form a distinct lineage. This has been named \\"Palintropiformes\\", but Apsaraviformes was proposed earlier for the Apsaravis lineage and is thus the senior synonym. And if this group is held to include Apatornis too, it would receive the name Ambiortiformes, which was proposed even earlier. Footnotes References * (2004): The Theropod Database: Phylogeny of taxa.

He was a football visionary who called for the introduction of Third and Fourth Divisions 12 years before they were formed. Biography Sharp was born in October 1894 in Bradford, England. He left school intent on making his way in business, and worked in his father's oil cloth shop. This was called Harry Sharp and Sons at this time but after Robert took control it was eventually renamed Sharps (Floor Furnishers) Ltd. It had been started as a market stall but expanded into multiple shops in several local towns before downsizing into the single one at Legrams Lane, Bradford. Later still it was handed over to his sons Peter and David. He was councillor for Bradford Moor from 1931 to 1934 and again from 1937 to 1945. He served as Deputy Lord Mayor in 1946. He represented the Eccleshill ward from 1950 to 1952. Football career Sharp was elected to the Bradford City board in February 1938. In July 1943 he put his name forward as the club manager when Fred Westgarth left to join Hartlepools United. He was manager for three years but never took charge of a competitive league match because of World War. Instead he handed over the reins to Jack Barker in May 1946. The same year, as the club's honorary secretary, at a meeting of the Division Three (North) committee he seconded a motion to introduce divisions Three and Four of the football league. In 1947 he bought Norman Bank, a large house in Idle, to convert into a hostel for single City players needing accommodation. He also commissioned a City gramophone record, Hello Chorus. He resigned from the City board in March 1948. Supporters bought an inscribed silver salver to recognise his ten years service to the club. It was presented by Lord Mayor Alderman Councillor F. J. Cowie. Fellow directors appointed Sharp and his wife Peggy as life-members of the club.

Archaeorhynchus is a genus of beaked avialan stem-birds from the early Cretaceous period. A fossil of its only known species, Archaeorhynchus spathula, was first reported in 2005 by Zhou & Zhang to have been found in Yixian Formation rocks at Yixian, Liaoning province, China, showing a well-preserved and essentially complete skeleton. Two more complete specimens were found in Lower Cretaceous deposits of Jianchang, Liaoning, northeastern China, preserving new anatomical information. These deposits are 120 million years old, whereas the original specimen was 125 million years old, meaning the age range for this species is 125-120Ma. Archaeorhychus is one of the earliest avialans known to have had a beak, and represents one of the most basal ornithuromorph avialans. The fossils preserved feathers associated with the neck, head and tail regions. The fossils also show grooves and openings/ holes (foramina) on the tips of the upper and lower jaws, suggesting that it supported a horny bill. Other features present suggest powerful flight capability similar to that of some modern birds. It has also been suggested that it had an herbivorous diet based on preserved gizzard stones found in its stomach. Description Archaeorhynchus was a medium-sized avialan, measuring about long. The three specimens have well-preserved skulls showing important anatomical information, including: slender maxilla and premaxilla, short nasals and discrete mandible elements. The skull bones of the holotype were slightly dislocated due to transportation. All three known fossil specimens have a preserved vertebrae column, although they are not entirely complete. However, when combining the three specimens together, the whole spine could be reconstructed. Based on reconstruction of the vertebrae, it was estimated that the backbone had 9 or 10 neck vertebrae and 9 or 10 tail vertebrae. The back vertebrae were not preserved. Archaeorhynchus had slender and curved vertebral ribs (ribs that do not attach to the breastbone) with robust and strong bases. The pectoral girdle had a robust and U shaped wishbone, a slightly curved shoulder blade, a short and robust coracoid and a broad and deeply notched breastbone. The hips had an unfused illium, a slender and curved pubis with a small pubic foot and a strap like ischium which is shorter than the pubis. The hind limb was shorter than the forelimb. The forelimbs had a humerus and a radus which were straighter and shorter than the ulna. The forelimbs also preserved the major and minor metacarpals as well as the finger bones showing a phalangeal formula of 2-3-2. The hind limbs have a robust and bowed femur, a tibia which is slightly longer than the femur, and a slender fibula. They also preserve four metatarsals (metatarsal V is not preserved) where metatarsals II-IV, are not fused to each other and where metatarsal III is the longest and widest, while the others are equal in length Feathers are preserved in the holotype and one of the two most recent finds, where they are associated with the neck, wing and tail regions. Relationships Phylogenetic analysis conducted by Zhou & Zhang indicated that Archaeorhynchus was most closely related to ornithurines. This is based on the fact that the Archaeorhynchus shared advanced features with other ornithurines such as a ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped wishbone, a \\"keel\\" for flight muscle attachments along the full length of the breastbone, and a compressed and expanded first finger bone of the major manual digit. Nonetheless, Archaeorhynchus also retained primitive features including the lower jaw not being strongly forked at the back, and deep posterior notches in the sternum. The holotype specimen also showed features which suggest powerful flight capability similar to modern birds. Diet Scientists have hypothesized that the Archaeorhynchus had an herbivorous diet, due to the large numbers of gastroliths (stomach stones) found in the gut of all known specimens. High numbers of these gastroliths suggest that they were not swallowed accidentally. These stones would have been eaten to help break down food that the animal would not have been able to chew due to the fact that it was toothless.

Its range in space and time may have been extensive, but its remains are rather few and far between, at least compared with its contemporary relatives in Hesperornis. Remains are known from central North America, namely the former shallows of the Western Interior Seaway in Kansas. Found only in the upper Niobrara Chalk, these are from around the Coniacian- Santonian boundary, 85-82 million years ago (mya). Photograph of scutes and feather impressions of the tarsal region of specimen (KUVP 2287) published by Williston (1898) in the University Geological Survey of Kansas Parahesperornis alexi (Martin, 1984) was long lumped with specimen YPM 1478, described initially as Hesperornis gracilis and later moved to the monotypic genus Hargeria (Lucas, 1903). It then turned out that this genus' description actually referred to specimen KUVP 2287, which eventually became the holotype of P. alexi. Nonetheless, the taxon description of Hargeria was about \\"Hesperornis\\" gracilis exclusively, and thus despite the misidentification it applies to YPM 1478, the holotype of \\"H.\\" gracilis. This mistake was rectified by later authors, who sank Hargeria back into Hesperornis.Bell, A. and Everhart, M.J. (2009). \\"A new specimen of Parahesperornis (Aves: Hesperornithiformes) from the Smoky Hill Chalk (Early Campanian) of Western Kansas.\\" Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science, 112(1/2): 7-14. In 2017, Asiahesperornis was considered as a possible synonym of Parahesperornis. Parahesperornis was a member of the Hesperornithes, flightless toothed seabirds of the Cretaceous and more specifically in the main lineage, close to Hesperornis.Mortimer (2004) Possibly the genus extended into the Campanian, to less than 80 mya. In any case, there are two very similar fossils from the Nemegt Formation (Maastrichtian or possibly late Campanian, around 76-66 mya), which were found at Tsagaan Kushu (Mongolia). Both are distal ends of tibiotarsi, and they seem certainly more similar to the bones of Hesperornithiformes and (due to the smallish size) to Parahesperornis specifically. However, they are not very diagnostic regardless, and the diversity of Parahesperornis remains enigmatic. Footnotes References * Lucas, F. A. 1903.

Japanese POW transport ships are often referred to as hell ships, due to their notoriously unpleasant conditions and the many deaths that occurred on board. In December 1944, the ship was bombed by American aircraft, killing 200 Allied POWs. Hundreds more died in the months that followed. Sinking Hellcat from shows POWs swimming in the water. Oryoku burning on 15 December 1944. Oryoku Maru left Manila on December 13, 1944, with 1,620 prisoners of war (including 1,556 American, 50 British and Dutch, 7 Czech, 4 Norwegians and several other nationalities) packed in the holds, and 1,900 Japanese civilians and military personnel in the cabins.È¥®Á∑ë‰∏∏. Museum of Japanese Merchant Ships. As she neared the naval base at Olongapo in Subic Bay, US Navy planes from attacked the unmarked ship, causing it to sink on December 15. About 270 died aboard ship. Some died from suffocation or dehydration. Others were killed in the attack, drowned or were shot while escaping the ship as it sank in Subic Bay where the 'Hell Ship Memorial' is located. A colonel, in his official report, wrote: :Many men lost their minds and crawled about in the absolute darkness armed with knives, attempting to kill people in order to drink their blood or armed with canteens filled with urine and swinging them in the dark. The hold was so crowded and everyone so interlocked with one another that the only movement possible was over the heads and bodies of others. Experience of the survivors The survivors of the sinking were held for several days in an open tennis court at Olongapo Naval Base. While there, the prisoners were afforded no sanitary conditions whatsoever. Prisoners experienced severe mistreatment, and several deaths occurred. The group of prisoners was then moved to San Fernando, Pampanga. While in San Fernando, 15 weak or wounded prisoners were loaded on a truck, believing they would be taken to Bilibid Prison for treatment. In the 1946 war crimes trial, they were reported to have been taken to a nearby cemetery, beheaded, and dumped into a mass grave. The remaining prisoners were then transported by train to San Fernando, La Union. There, about 1,000 of the survivors were loaded on another Japanese ship, Enoura Maru, while the rest boarded the smaller . Both ships reached Takao (Kaohsiung) harbor in Taiwan on New Year's Day. On January 6, the smaller group of prisoners was transferred from Brazil Maru to Enoura Maru, and 37 British and Dutch were taken ashore. However, on January 9, Enoura Maru was bombed and disabled while in harbor, killing about 350 men. The survivors were put aboard Brazil Maru which arrived in Moji, Japan, on January 29, 1945. Only 550 of the over 900 who sailed from Taiwan were still alive; 150 more men died in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea in the following months, leaving only 403 survivors of the original 1,620 to be liberated from camps in Kyushu, Korea, Manchuria, and Taiwan in August and September 1945. Aftermath Junsaburo Toshino, former lieutenant and Guard Commandant aboard the ship, was found guilty of murdering and supervising the murder of at least 16 men, and sentenced to death as a Class B war criminal at Yokohama. Shuske Wada, whose charges paralleled those of Toshino, was the official interpreter for the guard group. (Both Toshino and Wada had supervised the San Fernando murders.) Wada was found guilty of causing the deaths of numerous American and Allied prisoners of war by neglecting to transmit to his superiors requests for adequate quarters, food, drinking water, and medical attention. Wada was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. All the other guards received long prison sentences. The captain of the ship, Shin Kajiyama, was acquitted, \\"as he had no chance to prevent any atrocities\\".. USA v. Junsaburo Toshino et al.

Compared with the efforts of the other former constituents of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, it has been restricted to half-measures, if conducted at all.Karl W. Ryavec. Russian Bureaucracy: Power and Pathology, 2003, Rowman & Littlefield, , page 13 The facade of the Grand Kremlin Palace was restored to its original form after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The State Emblem of the USSR and the embedded letters forming the abbreviation of the USSR (CCCP) were both removed and replaced by five Russian double-headed eagles. An additional restoration of the coat of arms of the various territories of the Russian Empire were placed above the eagles. Notable anti-communist measures in the Russian Federation are the banning of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (and creating the Communist Party of the Russian Federation) as well as the names of some Russian cities reverting to what they were before the 1917 October Revolution (Leningrad to Saint Petersburg, Sverdlovsk to Yekaterinburg and Gorky to Nizhny Novgorod) though others were maintained with Ulyanovsk and Tolyatti being examples. Even though Leningrad and Sverdlovsk were renamed, regions that were named after them are still officially called Leningrad's and Sverdlovsk's regions. However, Nostalgia for the Soviet Union is gradually on the rise in Russia. Communist symbols continue to form an important part of the rhetoric used in state-controlled media as banning them is seen by the foreign ministry as \\"sacrilege\\" and \\"a perverse idea of good and evil\\". The decommunization process in neighbouring Ukraine was also met with criticism by Russia, and Soviet war crimes continue to be regularly dismissed as \\"Western myth\\". The State Anthem of the Russian Federation, accepted in 2000 (the same year Vladimir Putin had entered his first term as the president of Russia), uses the exact same melody as the State Anthem of the USSR, but with new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov. August 1991 attempted coup On 23 August 1991, two days after the failure of the August Coup, the people applauded Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, for suspending the existence of the Communist Party of the Russian SFSR pending investigation of its role in the recent events. This decision was taken over the objections of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who insisted that the Party as a whole was not to blame.RSFSR Presidential Decree No 79 (23 August 1991), \\"On suspending the activities of the RSFSR Communist Party\\" (–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–°–§–°–† –æ—Ç 23 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 1991 –≥–æ–¥–∞ N 79 \\"–û –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –†–°–§–°–†\\"). The Communist Party Regional committees (obkom) in the Russian SFSR were closed, and the building of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the Old Square in Moscow was sealed. The following day, on 24 August 1991, Gorbachev dissolved the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party (CPSU) and resigned as its Secretary General while remaining President of the Soviet Union. On 25 August, Yeltsin issued another decree nationalizing the property of the Communist Party, including its archives and bank accounts, and transferring their control to the RSFSR Council of Ministers.RSFSR Presidential Decree No 90 (25 August 1991), \\"Concerning the property of the RSFSR Communist Party\\" –û–± –∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ö–ü–°–° –∏ –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –†–°–§–°–† \\". Within a few weeks of the coup, the Soviet Union peacefully broke up. On 6 November 1991, Yeltsin banned the Soviet Communist Party (CPSU), which had exercised pervasive control over the Soviet society for years.RSFSR Presidential Decree, No 169 (6 November 1991), \\"On the activities of the CPSU and the RSFSR Communist Party\\" (–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–°–§–°–† –æ—Ç 6 –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 1991 –≥–æ–¥–∞ N 169 \\"–û –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö–ü–°–° –∏ –ö–ü –†–°–§–°–†\\"). The breakup of the Soviet Union was acknowledged in the Belavezha Accords of 8 December, ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR on 12 December. On 26 December 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union was declared. Its largest constituent republic, the Russian SFSR, was renamed the Russian Federation. It was formally established on 1 January 1992 and became the successor state to the Soviet Union. =Coup investigation, 1991‚Äì1992= The Parliamentary Commission for Investigating Causes and Reasons of the coup attempt was established in 1991 under Lev Ponomaryov (including also Gleb Yakunin), but in 1992 it was dissolved at Ruslan Khasbulatov's insistence. Having gained access to secret KGB archives as a member of the committee, in March 1992, Gleb Yakunin published materials about co-operation of the Moscow Patriarchate with KGB. He claimed that Patriarch Alexius II, Mitropolit Filaret of Kiev, Pitrim of Volokolamsk, and others were recruited by the KGB.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West, Gardners Books (2000), Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A.

A large part of the archives of the Communist Party (preserved now in state archives such as Archive of the President of the Russian Federation, Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History and State Archive of the Russian Federation), including almost all documents of its Central Committee, remains classified. For a 1993 view on the problem, see Khubova, Dar'ia & Vitaly Chernetsky (1993).\\"The Case of the Russian Archives: An Interview with Iurii N. Afanas'ev\\". Slavic Review 52 (2), 338‚Äì352.

In 1992, several People's Deputies sued Yeltsin, demanding that his 1991 decrees concerning the Communist Party be declared acts that violated the principles of the contemporary Constitution. On 30 November 1992, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation partially reviewed the decrees and lifted the ban against the Communist Party of the Russian SFSR Communist Party re-established The Communist Party of the Russian Federation was re- established in February 1993. A number of smaller communist parties claimed to be successors of the CPSU as well. Unlike many other countries of the former Soviet bloc, in Russia lustration of senior Communist Party and KGB officials was staunchly resisted and has never been implemented there. Many with such a background have remained in power; most present-day Russian politicians began their careers in the Soviet period. A draft law on lustration was first put before the Russian parliament, then the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, in December 1992 by Galina Starovoytova. Neither at that time nor later have such proposals been successfully introduced. Those arrested for their part in the August Coup were released from prison in 1992. The charges against them were lifted on 23 February 1994 under an amnesty issued by the State Duma, which also covered those involved in the October 1993 events. Vasily Starodubtsev served as Governor of the Tula Region from 1997 to 2005; Gorbachev's former deputy Anatoly Lukyanov was elected to the State Duma in 1993‚Äì2003 as a deputy of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation; the unrepentant Stalinist Valentin Varennikov (1923‚Äì2009) was a Duma deputy first for the RF Communist Party, from 1995 to 2003 and then for Rodina. Both Lukyanov and Varennikov headed parliamentary committees. Coming to terms with the Soviet past Conscious attempts in Russian society to deal with the Soviet past have been uncertain.Nelson, Susan H. \\"The Bureaucratic Politics of Democracy Promotion: The Russian Democratization Project\\" PhD Diss, University of Maryland, 2006. Organisations such as the Memorial Society have worked on numerous projects involving witnesses to past events (Gulag inmates, Soviet rights activists) and younger generations, including schoolchildren. On 30 October 2017 Putin attempted to draw a line under the past when he unveiled the massive but controversial Wall of Grief monument in Moscow.

The term is also used to refer to the relationships between the mean queue length and mean waiting/service time in such a model. The formula was first published by Felix Pollaczek in 1930 and recast in probabilistic terms by Aleksandr Khinchin two years later. In ruin theory the formula can be used to compute the probability of ultimate ruin (probability of an insurance company going bankrupt). Mean queue length The formula states that the mean number of customers in system L is given by : L = \\\\rho + \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2 + \\\\lambda^2 \\\\operatorname{Var}(S)}{2(1-\\\\rho)} where *\\\\lambda is the arrival rate of the Poisson process *1/\\\\mu is the mean of the service time distribution S *\\\\rho=\\\\lambda/\\\\mu is the utilization *Var(S) is the variance of the service time distribution S. For the mean queue length to be finite it is necessary that \\\\rho < 1 as otherwise jobs arrive faster than they leave the queue. \\"Traffic intensity,\\" ranges between 0 and 1, and is the mean fraction of time that the server is busy. If the arrival rate \\\\lambda is greater than or equal to the service rate \\\\mu, the queuing delay becomes infinite. The variance term enters the expression due to Feller's paradox. Mean waiting time If we write W for the mean time a customer spends in the system, then W=W'+\\\\mu^{-1} where W' is the mean waiting time (time spent in the queue waiting for service) and \\\\mu is the service rate. Using Little's law, which states that :L=\\\\lambda W where *L is the mean number of customers in system *\\\\lambda is the arrival rate of the Poisson process *W is the mean time spent at the queue both waiting and being serviced, so :W = \\\\frac{\\\\rho + \\\\lambda \\\\mu \\\\text{Var}(S)}{2(\\\\mu-\\\\lambda)} + \\\\mu^{-1}. We can write an expression for the mean waiting time as :W' = \\\\frac{L}{\\\\lambda} - \\\\mu^{-1} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho + \\\\lambda \\\\mu \\\\text{Var}(S)}{2(\\\\mu-\\\\lambda)}. Queue length transform Writing œÄ(z) for the probability-generating function of the number of customers in the queue :\\\\pi(z) = \\\\frac{(1-z)(1-\\\\rho)g(\\\\lambda(1-z))}{g(\\\\lambda(1-z))-z} where g(s) is the Laplace transform of the service time probability density function. Waiting time transform Writing W*(s) for the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution, :W^\\\\ast(s) = \\\\frac{(1-\\\\rho)s}{s-\\\\lambda(1-g(s))} where again g(s) is the Laplace transform of service time probability density function. nth moments can be obtained by differentiating the transform n times, multiplying by (‚àí1)n and evaluating at s = 0\\\\.

Epstein is the current Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is an ordained Humanist Rabbi, and he has been influential in American humanism as a blogger, spokesperson, adviser and author of the New York Times Bestselling book Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe. Early life and education Epstein grew up in Flushing, Queens, New York as an assimilated and disinterested Reform Jew. He studied Buddhism and Taoism while at Stuyvesant High School in New York City and in college went to Taiwan for a semester aiming to study Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in its original language and context. Finding that Eastern religions do not necessarily have greater access to truth than Western ones, he returned to the US and shifted his focus to rock music, recording and singing professionally for a year after college. Soon thereafter, he learned of the movement of Humanism and the possibility of a career as a Humanist rabbi and chaplain. Humanism at Harvard In 2005, Epstein received ordination as a Humanist Rabbi from the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, where he studied in Jerusalem and Michigan for five years. He holds a BA (Religion and Chinese) and an MA (Judaic Studies) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a Masters of Theological Studies from the Harvard Divinity School. Epstein began serving as Humanist Chaplain at Harvard in fall 2005, when the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard's total annual budget was $28,000. In the years since then, he has raised nearly $3 million in gifts and pledges to the organization, while organizing and launching a range of new programs and initiatives, including opening the Humanist Hub, a \\"Center for Humanist Life\\" in Harvard Square, where members are encouraged to \\"connect with other people, act to make the world better, and evolve as human beings.\\" While at Harvard, Epstein has blogged for CNN, Newsweek and The Washington Post; and his work as a Humanist rabbi and chaplain has been featured by ABC World News with Diane Sawyer. ABC News Network, Al Jazeera and others. He is an adviser to two student groups at Harvard College, the Secular Society and the Interfaith Council, and to the Harvard Humanist Graduate Community. From 2007 to 2010, he chaired the Advisory Board of the national umbrella organization the Secular Student Alliance, joining such renowned nonbelievers as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. In 2011 he lectured at the inaugural event of the group Agnostics, Atheists, Humanists, & Secularists in Santa Monica, California. In an interview, Epstein says that being a Humanist Rabbi \\"means I combine Jewish culture with the belief that this world is all we have\\". He is not anti- religious and \\"he is happy to work with the religious left (as he calls it) to help beat off the fundamentalist religious right.\\" The Guardian compares his influence in American humanism to Richard Dawkins influence in the UK. Humanist Community Project Epstein led the Boston-based Humanist Community Project, later renamed to Humanist Hub, together with assistant humanist chaplain Vanessa Zoltan. The project boasted several hundred student members and its mission included developing \\"opportunities for connection, ethical development, and the celebration of life based on human reason, compassion, and creativity, not religious dogma.\\" Humanism and the Ethics of Technology at MIT Epstein serves as humanist chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) concurrently with his Harvard post. At MIT his role focuses in large part on the ethics of technology. His duties include encouraging non- religious students to give deep consideration to the societal impact of the entrepreneurial ventures they may go on to launch.

In 1869, the \\"Diocese of the Falkland Isles\\" with jurisdiction over the rest of South America except for British Guiana was established.Milmine, Obispo Douglas (ed). La Comuni√≥n Anglicana en Am√©rica Latina s/f. p.8; p. 8; p.11 respectively The name was due to a legal technicality: at that time there was no way an English bishop could be consecrated for areas outside the jurisdiction of the Crown. From the start, the bishop resided in Buenos Aires and had his administrative office there. From 1902 to 1973, the jurisdiction of the diocese was progressively reduced in area as more dioceses were established in South America and after the formation of the \\"Consejo Anglicano Sudamericano\\" in 1973 as a step towards the formation of a new province of the Anglican Communion the Parish became extra-provincial under the direct jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury.Milmine, Obispo Douglas (ed). La Comuni√≥n Anglicana en Am√©rica Latina s/f. p. 16; p.17 respectively Until the war between Britain and Argentina in 1982, at the Archbishop's request episcopal functions were performed by the Anglican Bishop of Argentina. History, 1869‚Äì1978 Waite Hockin Stirling was consecrated the first bishop of the diocese in 1869. After his tenure, the history of the Falkland Islands diocese largely followed the waxing and waning fortunes of the South American Missionary Society (SAMS). In 1910 the diocese was divided for the first time into \\"East Coast\\" and \\"West Coast\\". Edward Every became Bishop of Argentina and Eastern South America, and Lawrence Blair became Bishop of the Falkland Islands, which included oversight of Chile, Bolivia and Peru. He resigned in 1914 and Every took the post. 1910 was also the year of the World Missionary Conference at Edinburgh. Norman de Jersey was bishop for 15 years. In 1934 he was succeeded by John Weller. Financial constraints caused him to consolidate, becoming Bishop of Argentina and Eastern South America while retaining oversight of the Falkland Islands, which technically was a vacant see until 1946. Daniel Evans, formerly of Rio de Janeiro, took over in 1946 when the diocese was once more united as the Diocese of the Falkland Islands, covering nearly all of South America. He died of a heart attack in Southern Chile in 1962. After a convention in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in 1963, the Anglican Church underwent dramatic changes and the vast diocese was divided into three parts. The West Coast Diocese of Chile, Bolivia and Peru came under Kenneth Howell, a former South American Missionary Society (SAMS) missionary, and Cyril Tucker was consecrated under two separate mandates, one as Bishop of Argentina and Eastern South America, and the other as Bishop of the Falkland Islands. The SAMS played an important part in financing and establishing the two bishoprics. As a result of increased SAMS activity, more dioceses were created: in 1973 Northern Argentina and Paraguay; the Diocese of Peru in 1977; Uruguay in 1988 and Bolivia in 1996 (now all part of the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone of South America). The South America Dioceses joined to form the Anglican Council of South America, which included the Falkland Islands. This proved unsuitable for the congregations of the Falklands, as proceedings were conducted in Spanish, and most of the residents were English speaking.Vincent, Patrick (March 1983). The Geographical Journal, Vol. 149, No. 1, pp 16‚Äì17. History from 1978 In 1978, Donald Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury, assumed personal responsibility for the Falkland Islands, with episcopal oversight exercised by his commissary. The first Episcopal Commissary for the Falkland Islands was Richard Cutts in Buenos Aires, an Anglo-Argentine and former missionary in Africa, who had succeeded Cyril Tucker in 1975. In 1982, during the Falklands War many British troops came under the episcopal oversight of the Bishop to the Forces. The Archbishop of Canterbury decided to exercise his responsibility by giving his commission to any bishop visiting the islands. In January 2007, Stephen Venner was appointed Episcopal Commissary, succeeded by Nigel Stock in 2014. The Episcopal Commissary is also known as Bishop for the Falkland Islands. Since 1978, the clergy of the cathedral have adopted the office of rector. The post was held successively by Harry Bagnall (1979‚Äì1986), John Murphy, Stephen Palmer (1991‚Äì1996), Alistair McHaffie (1998‚Äì2003), Paul Sweeting (2003‚Äì2006), Richard Hines (2007‚Äì2014) and Canon David Roper (2014‚Äì2015).

Band description  Experimental Mexican Indie Rock band formed in Aguascalientes, Mexico towards the end of 1997. The band describes its sound as \\"Sonic Craft\\" (Artesan√≠a Sonora). This characterization comes from their combination of folkloric arrangements and lyrics combined with experimental rock and subtle electronic arrangements. The musical instruments they employ range from: drums and percussion instruments, electric and acoustic guitars, electric bass, fretless bass, whistles, bells, miscellaneous wind instruments, etc. Their musical influence ranges from all variants of rock music, blues, free jazz, contemporary music, experimentation, Mexican traditional music. They often read stories in their live presentations between sets, with surreal and mythical themes. Their Lyrics are likewise of ethereal and mythical nature. Throughout their years active, they have created a unique musical experience; not only for the audience, but for themselves. Since they formed their band, they had thought of developing a musical proposal that would not limit them to the conscious restraints that other musicians often are limited by. They have achieved this distinction with their use of pantomime and theatrical elements on stage: An example of this is that vocalist, Alejandro V√°zquez has painted his face as it is being distorted by standing behind a sheet of glass and wears different masks while singing. Alejandro V√°zquez can be heard engaging the audience as he reads short stories between their live set of their album Suena Vivo, recorded live between January 2003 and October 2004, and features drummer Juli√°n Villa who currently lives in Norway. The result in these lively performances has resulted in a positive reaction on the audience, as shown when they performed live for the presentation of their Suena Vivo album in 2004. They have played in different types of venues, like theaters, bars, streets and festivals. Every time adapting their show to the venue they will be playing in.

She trained the chimpanzees who appeared on the Brooke Bond PG Tips television advertisements in the 1960s to the 1980s. Badham was born in Evesham in Worcestershire, the daughter of a herbalist and homeopath. She was educated at Town School in Sutton Coldfield. She kept animals from an early age, and bred dogs and ran a boarding kennel, before setting up a pet shop in her home town. Another pet shop in the town was run by Nathalie Evans. Badham bought a woolly monkey named \\"Sambo\\" from Evans. Although the animal soon died, the two business rivals went on to share a flat ‚Äì along with two chimpanzees, Sue and Mickey ‚Äì and later became co- founders of Twycross Zoo. They moved to a bungalow in Hints, between Sutton Coldfield and Tamworth, in 1954, setting up Hints Zoological Society in the acre plot. Their collection of animals grew, and in 1962 they bought Norton Grange, a large Victorian rectory with of land, plus farm buildings and stables. They opened to visitors as Twycross Zoo on Whitsun bank holiday, 26 May 1963. Over time, the zoo expanded onto adjoining fields to cover over . Badham became an expert of primates in captivity. She provided chimpanzees for PG Tips tea commercials (notably Mr Shifter) as a way to raise funds for the zoo, and one of the zoo's chimpanzees appeared in a Hammer Horror film with Peter Cushing. She kept studbooks for gibbons and chimpanzees. The Department of the Environment appointed her as an Inspector under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. The zoo grew to have the largest collection of primates in the world. The first colobus monkey bred in captivity in Britain was born at the zoo in 1969, and Britain's first bonobo was born at the zoo in 1994. Badham and Evans set up a charity, the East Midlands Zoological Society, to which their animal collection and zoo premises were donated in 1972. She published two books with Evans and Maureen Lawless: Chimps with Everything, published in 1979, and Molly's Zoo, published in 2000. She also participated in a television series, Molly's Zoo, in 1999, about the running of the zoo. Badham was a founder member of the National Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland, and a member of the International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens.

In turn leading to a reduction in surplus generated relative to an outright monopoly, if the two agents do not cooperate. The theory was originally proposed in the nineteenth century by Antoine Augustin Cournot. This can be seen in private toll roads where more than one operator controls a different section of the road. The solution is for one agent to purchase all sections of the road. Complementary goods are a less extreme form of this effect. In this case, one good is still of value even if the other good is not obtained. In a 1968 paper Hugo F. Sonnenschein claim complementary monopoly is equivalent to Cournot duopoly. Example Consider a road between two towns where half of the road is owned by two agents. A customer must pass two toll booth in order to pass from one town to the other. Each agent sets the price of his toll booth. Given a demand function, D = D_{max}\\\\cdot (P_{max} - P), The optimal price for a monopolist is P = \\\\frac{P_{max}} {2} leading to revenue of R = {D}\\\\cdot {P} = {D_{max}\\\\cdot (P_{max} - \\\\frac{P_{max}} {2})}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{P_{max}} {2} = {D_{max}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{P_{max}^2} {4}} If both agents are independently setting their prices, then the Nash equilibrium is for each to set their price at P = \\\\frac{P_{max}} {3}. This leads to an increase in the total price to P = \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot P_{max}} {3} and a decrease in total revenue to R = {D}\\\\cdot {P} = {D_{max}\\\\cdot (P_{max} - \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot P_{max}} {3})}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot P_{max}} {3} = {D_{max}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot P_{max}^2} {9}} The total revenue generated by the two owners is reduced and the price is increased. This means that both the owners and the users of the road are worse off than they would otherwise be.

Although also reaching legal maturity at 18, a Filipino man may mark his own debut on his 21st birthday, albeit with less formal celebrations or none at all. Description On her 18th birthday, a Filipino girl customarily throws a large party, similar to quincea√±era or sweet sixteen, complete with her own hand-picked entourage of 18 individuals or multiple sets of 18. In most cases, the debutante may choose 18 roses and 18 candles if she wishes to. The sole purpose of the roses is to honor the closest male to the celebrant. This includes uncles, cousins, close friends, suitors or boyfriend. Most debut celebrations prefer the number of people participating add up to 18. This is why they keep it to 18 roses and 18 candles. The celebrant's court usually wears a formal dress, such as the Barong Tagalog or the western black tie. =Program= A typical ceremony begins with a short prayer invoking blessings upon the debutante. She then enters, and performs traditional dances with her court for their guests. The most important one is known as the \\"Grand Cotillion Dance\\", usually a waltz. An \\"18 Roses Dance\\" or \\"9 Roses Dance\\" is also done, in which 18 or 9 males of the debutante's choice dance with her after presenting her with a single red rose or her favorite flower. This dance is almost always preceded or concluded with a \\"Father and Daughter Dance\\", and sometimes the father takes the place of the 18th or 9th rose (who is often the girl's significant other). An older male relative, such as a grandfather, may take the father's place if the latter is unavailable or deceased. The debutante also has 18 or 9 \\"candles\\", presented by female friends or relations. Each delivers a short speech about her relationship with the celebrant and any special greeting, and lights a candle that is either in her hand or placed in a stand. Music and other performances are usually interspersed between the \\"18 items\\" \\"9 items\\" rites, while dinner and sometimes alcohol are served. A birthday cake ceremony often occurs, and a fireworks display may conclude more extravagant parties. The night ends with the debutante's speech, in which she shares her thoughts on life and extends her gratitude towards her guests. =Other \\"18 or 9 items\\"= Recent additions to the ceremony are the \\"18 Treasures\\", in which 18 individuals (male or female) each present the debutante with a gift. These usually also involve a speech from each individual, but unlike the Roses and Candles sets, these groups are of mixed gender. Others involve material presents for the debutante, such as the 18 shoes and the 18 bills. A \\"blue bill\\" in the context of this ceremony refers to the Philippine one thousand peso note, which is blue. Lastly, there are the (optional) 18 white roses. If the debutante is missing a figure in her life such as a father, she chooses her 18 white roses in place of that figure. In film The custom was highlighted in the 2001 American small-budget film The Debut,\\"The Debut\\" - starring Dante Basco.
