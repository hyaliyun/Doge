Susan Martin Susan Martin was originated by Denise Alexander from April 14, 1966 to February 6, 1973, when the character was written out of the show temporarily when the Days casting office hit a snag renewing Alexander's contract and the contract lapsed. ABC Daytime rushed to offer her a then-unheard of salary/perks package to join General Hospital as Lesley Webber. When Susan finally returned to Days, a new actress, Bennye Gatteys played her from April 6, 1973 to October 1, 1976. Susan was an old high school classmate of Julie Olson, her storyline involved the first major \\"Days\\" death when her son Dickie Martin accidentally died in May 1967, which culminated into the first \\"Days\\" murder Susan kills her husband, David Martin. Sandy Horton Dr. Sandy Horton is a fictional character on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives. She is the daughter of Kitty and Tommy Horton, Jr. and the granddaughter of original characters Alice and Tom Horton. The role was originated by Astrid Warner who portrayed the role briefly for two episodes on December 12 and 13, 1967, it was around that time the role was recast with actress Heather North, the actress who played Sandy for the longest duration from December 20, 1967 to May 21, 1971 and from December 23, 1971 to June 16, 1972. North would later be commonly known being the second and most notable actress to provide the voice of Daphne Blake in all incarnations of Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoon series. In 1982, Sandy was reintroduced to the series with actress Martha Smith, who would play the role for four months from August 12 to December 8. Seven months later, the role was recast, this time with Pamela Roylance. Roylance would only last for about seven months, starting on July 18, 1983 and ultimately leaving on April 11, 1984. David Banning David Banning, most notably portrayed by Richard Guthrie (1975‚Äì1980) and Gregg Marx (1981‚Äì1983), is the son of Julie Olson (Susan Seaforth Hayes) and her late lover David Martin. David Martin, Jr. is born in January 1968 to Julie Olson (Catherine Ferrar) and he is immediately put up for adoption. The child is adopted by Scott Banning (Mike Farrell) and his terminally ill wife Janet (Joyce Easton) as Bradley Banning (Chad Barstad). Susan Martin (Denise Alexander) befriends the Bannings and often helps care for Janet and baby Brad. As Susan comforts Scott after Janet's death in early 1969, Julie (Susan Seaforth Hayes) discovers that Brad is the child she gave up and seduces Scott away from Susan. Though Julie and Scott marry in 1970, by 1971, she's fallen in love with Doug Williams (Bill Hayes) and plans to leave Scott but wants to make sure she can retain custody of David (Jeffrey Williams). As Julie is set to divorce Scott in 1972, she plans to elope with Doug and honeymoon in Portofino and wants to bring David along. However, Doug is not interested in parenthood and he spontaneously marries Julie's mother Addile Olson (Patricia Barry). After Scott's death in early 1973, Julie sends David off to military school. The 18 year old David (Richard Guthrie) returns in the summer of 1975 with his new girlfriend Brooke Hamilton (Adrienne LaRussa). Brooke is jealous of David's growing closeness with his mother Julie and to drive a wedge between them, Brooke spread rumors about Julie being unfaithful to his stepfather Bob Anderson (Mark Tapscott) and potentially being pregnant with Doug's child. David and Julie get into a fight and he runs off and gets into a car accident in which he is presumed dead. David survives and is taken in the Grants where he befriends the daughter Valerie Grant (Tina Andrews). Meanwhile, Brooke learns she is pregnant with David's baby but refuses to marry him because he is in love with Valerie. In 2017, it is revealed that David has died in a motorbike accident. It is also revealed that he has another son, Eli Grant, with Valerie. Mike Horton Mike Horton is the son of Laura Horton, and was named Mickey Horton, who was thought to be his father, though his actual father was Bill Horton, Mickey's brother. Mike has the honor of being the most recast character in Days of our Lives history, having been played by sixteen different actors since his character's birth in 1968. He's also been the most constantly aged and deaged. His most well known (and longest lasting) portrayers were Wesley Eure from June 6, 1974 to January 16, 1981, Michael T. Weiss from August 8, 1985 to March 1, 1990, and Roark Critchlow from April 27, 1994 to November 19, 1999 and June 23 to 28, 2010. Mike grew up knowing his father as town lawyer Mickey Horton and was as shocked as Mickey was to learn that his true father is the man he thought was his uncle Bill, who drunkenly raped his mother, Dr. Laura Spencer, while she was married to Mickey. Although Mike has become a bit closer to Bill through the years, he still considers Mickey to be his father. Mike was married for the first time very young to Margo Anderman and his wife died in the summer of 1980 of leukemia. He left town not long after that happened, but later returned and began a residency at Salem University, while looking after his teenage sister, Jennifer. During this time, he began a relationship with Dr. Robin Jacobs, which was made difficult by their different religions, Robin was devoutly Jewish and Mike was Catholic and she wouldn't allow herself to marry inter-faith. Although Mike wanted to convert in order to make the relationship work, he eventually realized that wouldn't be fair to either of them and Robin left town to live in Israel. Sometime later Mike learned that Robin had given birth to his son, Jeremy. Mike left Salem in 1990 to join Robin and Jeremy and try to make a family. In 1994, Mike returned to Salem, it having not worked out between him and Robin. He was soon made Chief of Staff at Salem University Hospital, over rival Craig Wesley. Craig convinces nurse Ali McIntyre to pursue a relationship with Mike to get the head nurse's job, but when she doesn't get the job she sues Mike and the hospital for sexual harassment. During this, he began an affair with Carrie Brady Reed, who worked in Public Relations at the hospital. Eventually Carrie's husband Austin Reed found out, and the two divorced. Mike and Carrie devised a plan to get Ali to admit what she and Craig were planning, but when she figured it out, she drugged and kidnapped Mike. She planned to force him to elope with her, but Roman Brady caught and arrested her. Ali was declared mentally unstable and institutionalized. Mike and Carrie got together officially and left Salem together to return to Israel, as Mike wanted to continue to have a relationship with his son. While off-screen, Mike and Carrie split up and his son Jeremy returned to Salem for a brief period. Mike returned to Salem in June 2010 when he received news that his grandmother, Alice Horton was extremely ill. Mike returned along with many other family members. While on his way to Alice's, he was involved in a car accident and was injured. He was brought to University Hospital where he was treated. His goal was to get better quickly so he could visit his grandmother one last time. Several days later, he received news from Bill and Jennifer Horton that Alice had died. He reminisced about the wonderful times he shared with Alice. Before leaving Salem, he hung up a plaque in the hospital in honor of his late grandmother.

Portland: Timber Press. / Description The stems are small, densely clustering, spiny, and high climbing with long internodes and conspicuous scars. Young leaves are undivided or with few segments, in maturity becoming pinnate and cirrate with a tubular, unarmed or sparsely armed, scaly leaf sheath. Ocreas present, entire or becoming tattered. The petiole, when present, and the proximal end of the rachis are deeply channeled and spiny; the cirrus and distal end of the rachis are armed with regularly arranged reflexed climbing spines. The single fold, lanceolate leaflets may be few to numerous, usually with armed margins and caducous scales, with conspicuous midribs and transverse veinlets. The inflorescence is produced at the top of the stem amongst the most distal, often reduced leaves, axis adnate to the internode and emerging from the leaf sheath mouth. The peduncle is short, the prophyll is tubular and two-keeled, peduncular bracts usually absent, and the rachis is much longer than the peduncle. The rachis bracts are tubular and more or less distichous, each subtending a horizontal or pendulous first order branch which features basal, tubular bracts with triangular limbs carrying monopodial flower clusters. In P. corneri the inflorescence is branched to three orders instead of two, with flowers borne on the axes of all orders. The male flowers are arranged in clusters of up to 32, each flower held in a cuplike rachilla bract with a two- keeled bracteole. The calyx is thick, leathery and tubular, with three lobes, and abaxially covered in scaly trichomes; the corolla is similar, with two distal splits forming three triangle shaped lobes, also bearing scales. The six stamens are laterally fused forming a tube which is tipped by six free, reflexed filaments with short, oblong anthers. The pollen is discate and elliptic with tectate exine; pistillode minute. Female flowers are usually borne in clusters of two to four but may be solitary, and, like the male's, are carried in cuplike bracts with two-keeled bracteoles, with the occasional barely developed second bracteole. The calyx is also thick and leathery, thrice lobed and scaly, usually persistent into fruit; corolla leathery, scaly, with three lobes. The staminodial ring bears six short lobes and sagging, empty anthers; gynoecium egg-shaped to cylindrical, the apical stigmas becoming scaly nearing antithesis. Three incomplete locules are present, each bearing one antropous, basally attached ovule. The fruit has one, rarely two seeds, covered in persistent perianth whorls, and stigmatic apical remains. The epicarp is matted in irregular vertical rows of reflexed scales, with a thin mesocarp and an undifferentiated endocarp. The seed is basally attached, spherical, usually depressed, with a thick sarcoesta, a homogeneous endosperm and a basal embryo. Distribution and habitat Plectocomiopsis triquetra and P. wrayi are low land peat swamp forest inhabitants, the former in Borneo, the latter in Malaysia. P. corneri and P. mira are Dipterocarp forest dwellers to 700 m, and P. geminiflora is distributed through a variety of tropical forest types to 1200 m. Cultivation and uses The Plectocomiopsis species are not usually cultivated, being extremely spiny and requiring particular tropical conditions. In their natural range they are used in basketry, however their fragile nature prevents them from being a common rattan source. The palm heart of P. geminiflora, despite its bitter taste, is regarded as a delicacy in Borneo; villagers regard some of the others as edible and some as poisonous.

Portland: Timber Press. / Description The trunks are both solitary and clustering with short internodes, usually covered in spiny, persistent leaf sheaths. The pinnate leaf has a tubular sheath with whorls and scatters of spines and hairy, brown tomentum, the sheath ending in a narrow, armed auricle on each side of the petiole. The petiole is abaxially rounded, adaxially flattened, hairy, and equipped with grapnel spines. The rachis is similarly armed, the leaflets widely spaced to crowded, linear, with one fold, and covered in bristles and scales; the midrib is adaxially prominent, the transverse veinlets are short yet conspicuous. The inflorescence, though axillary, is adnate to the internode and sheath of the following leaf, emerging erect between the auricles of the subtending leaf. In pistillate members it is branched to two orders, staminate to three; in both, a boat shaped, beak-ended prophyll encloses it. The prophyll may or may nor be armed and eventually develops a longitudinal split, exposing the flowers. The rachis bracts are small with free tips, the bracts on the first-order branches are tubular towards the base with triangular limbs. The staminate flowers are solitary borne, on second and third order branches, subtended by a tiny, tubular, triangular bract and a two keeled bracteole. The tubular calyx is proximally striate, divided into three triangular lobes; the corolla is divided nearly to the base into three lobes. The six stamen are borne at the base of the corolla with fleshy, elongated filaments, inflexed at the tip, with oblong, medifixed anthers. The pollen is elliptic, diporate with rugulate to reticulate, tectate exine. The larger pistillate flowers are borne in dyads, similarly subtended by a triangular bract, and accompanied by a sterile staminate flower and two, two keeled bracteoles. The sterile staminate flower is similar to the fertile but is slightly contorted with empty anthers. The pistillate has a striate, cup shaped calyx with triangular, valvate lobes, and the corolla splits to the base into similar triangular segments. There are six epipetalous staminodes, with triocular, triovulate, scaly, ovoid gynoecium and three fleshy, divergent, rugose stigmas, attached at the base. The fruit is globose or ovoid, beaked, with apical stigmatic remains and covered in vertical rows or magenta to brown scales. The single seed has a basal embryo, a thick sarcotesta and a sweet, homogeneous endosperm. Distribution and habitat These are a tropical plant, P. divaricatum and P. moorei are sometimes found high on Bornean ridge tops from 700 to 1000 m in podsolized soils or in heath forests called \\"kerangas\\".

Roots (usually referred to simply as Fort Roots) was a military base located in North Little Rock, Arkansas, set on a high promontory overlooking the Arkansas River. The land was traded to the Federal Government in 1892 in exchange for the property now known as MacArthur Park, in Little Rock, which had been a military arsenal since the 1830s when Arkansas was a territory. The base was named for Congressman Logan H. Roots in recognition for his work in the negotiations. The 66th United States Congress transferred Fort Roots to the Public Health Service department on March 4, 1921, for conversion to a veterans hospital for neuropsychiatric disorders. On June 10, 1983, a newly constructed hospital building was dedicated on the existing property. The main hospital building was formally named the Eugene J. Towbin Healthcare Center in May 1996 in honor of Eugene J. Towbin, M.D., Ph.D., in recognition of his 40-year career at the VA Medical Center. The Center provides long-term, rehabilitative care for eligible veterans. Although four of the existing hospital structures were demolished, Fort Roots (as the campus is still known) retained many of its original military buildings and an \\"parade ground\\" in the center of the original post. Many of the historic buildings flanking the former parade ground were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 in recognition of the area's military history, and virtually the entire campus was listed in 2013 in recognition of its significance as a Veterans Administration medical facility.

The lower half of the length of the rachis is covered in triads while the top has pairs of staminate flowers which shed early, leaving the inflorescence tip bare at antithesis. The bracts around the triads are pointed and ovate; those around the pairs have longer points. The bracts are adnate to the rachis and adjacent bracts forming depressions around the pairs; the bracteoles are inconspicuous. The staminate flowers are long and asymmetrical with three linear, triangular sepals, basally connate and adnate to the receptacle. They have three pointed, obovoid petals, which are elongated, valvate, and longer, wider and thicker than the sepals. The stamens are numerous, from 60 to 100, irregularly inserted, with cylindrical, elongated, flexible filaments which are bent and twisted, occasionally joined, apiculate, and dorsifixed a third of their length. The pollen is elliptic and monosulcate with finely reticulate, tectate exine.

This allows Fibre Channel to use 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks (or higher speeds) while preserving the Fibre Channel protocol. The specification was part of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards T11 FC-BB-5 standard published in 2009. Combined storage and local area network  Functionality  FCoE transports Fibre Channel directly over Ethernet while being independent of the Ethernet forwarding scheme. The FCoE protocol specification replaces the FC0 and FC1 layers of the Fibre Channel stack with Ethernet. By retaining the native Fibre Channel constructs, FCoE was meant to integrate with existing Fibre Channel networks and management software. Data centers used Ethernet for TCP/IP networks and Fibre Channel for storage area networks (SANs). With FCoE, Fibre Channel becomes another network protocol running on Ethernet, alongside traditional Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. FCoE operates directly above Ethernet in the network protocol stack, in contrast to iSCSI which runs on top of TCP and IP. As a consequence, FCoE is not routable at the IP layer, and will not work across routed IP networks. Since classical Ethernet had no priority-based flow control, unlike Fibre Channel, FCoE required enhancements to the Ethernet standard to support a priority-based flow control mechanism (to reduce frame loss from congestion). The IEEE standards body added priorities in the data center bridging (dcb) Task Group. Fibre Channel required three primary extensions to deliver the capabilities of Fibre Channel over Ethernet networks: * Encapsulation of native Fibre Channel frames into Ethernet Frames. * Extensions to the Ethernet protocol itself to enable an Ethernet fabric in which frames are not routinely lost during periods of congestion. * Mapping between Fibre Channel N_port IDs (aka FCIDs) and Ethernet MAC addresses. \\"Converged\\" network adapter Computers can connect to FCoE with converged network adapters (CNAs), which contain both Fibre Channel host bus adapter (HBA) and Ethernet network interface controller (NIC) functionality on the same physical card. CNAs have one or more physical Ethernet ports. FCoE encapsulation can be done in software with a conventional Ethernet network interface card, however FCoE CNAs offload (from the CPU) the low level frame processing and SCSI protocol functions traditionally performed by Fibre Channel host bus adapters.  Application  The main application of FCoE is in data center storage area networks (SANs). FCoE has particular application in data centers due to the cabling reduction it makes possible, as well as in server virtualization applications, which often require many physical I/O connections per server. With FCoE, network (IP) and storage (SAN) data traffic can be consolidated using a single network. This consolidation can: * reduce the number of network interface cards required to connect to disparate storage and IP networks * reduce the number of cables and switches * reduce power and cooling costs  Frame format  FCoE Frame Format FCoE is encapsulated over Ethernet with the use of a dedicated Ethertype, 0x8906. A single 4-bit field (version) satisfies the IEEE sub-type requirements. The 802.1Q tag is optional but may be necessary in a given implementation. The SOF (start of frame) and EOF (end of frame) are encoded as specified in . Reserved bits are present to guarantee that the FCoE frame meets the minimum length requirement of Ethernet. Inside the encapsulated Fibre Channel frame, the frame header is retained so as to allow connecting to a storage network by passing on the Fibre Channel frame directly after de-encapsulation. The FIP (FCoE Initialization Protocol) is an integral part of FCoE. Its main goal is to discover and initialize FCoE capable entities connected to an Ethernet cloud. FIP uses a dedicated Ethertype of 0x8914.  Timeline  In October 2003, Azul Technology developed early version and applied for a patent. US Patent 20080028096 granted January 31, 2008 In April 2007, the FCoE standardization activity started. In October 2007, the first public end-to-end FCoE demo occurred at Storage Network World including adapters from QLogic, switches from Nuova Systems, and storage from NetApp (none of the companies involved made any product announcements at the time). In April 2008, an early implementor was Nuova Systems, a subsidiary of Cisco Systems, which announced a switch. Brocade Communications Systems also announced support in 2008. After the late-2000s financial crisis, however, any new technology had a hard time getting established. In June 2009, the FCoE technology that had been defined as part of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) T11 FC-BB-5 standard was forwarded to ANSI for publication. In May 2010, the FC-BB-5 standard was published as ANSI/INCITS 462-2010. Official standard. Some additional work was done in the INCITS. Data center switches from Force10 and Dell PowerConnect supported FCoE and in June 2013, Dell Networking, which is the new brand-name for all networking portfolio of Dell, introduced the S5000 series which can be a fully native FCoE switch with the option to include a native fibre channel module, allowing you to connect the S5000 directly to an FC SAN environment.Dell Networking S-Series switches overview, visited 26 May 2013  See also  * iSCSI * ATA over Ethernet (AoE) * HyperSCSI * LIO Linux SCSI Target * SCST Linux FCoE target driver  References   External links  *FCoE Category:Fibre Channel Category:Network protocols Category:Ethernet Category:Computer storage buses ","title":"Fibre Channel over Ethernet"},{"id":"16766707","text":"Jaap is a Dutch given name that is short for Jacob or Jacobus (Jacob or James in English).

The state is covered by mountains, river valleys, forests, lakes, and bayous in addition to the cities of Arkansas. Hot Springs National Park features bubbling springs of hot water, formerly sought across the country for their healing properties. Crowley's Ridge is a geological anomaly rising above the surrounding lowlands of the Mississippi embayment. The Buffalo National River, as it flows through The Ozarks to the White River, is a popular tourist attraction. It was designated the first national river in 1972 after years of conservation efforts in opposition to a United States Army Corps of Engineers plan to dam the river. The Arkansas River enters the state near Van Buren and flows southeast through Little Rock to empty into the Mississippi River near Arkansas Post. Most of the river serves barge traffic to Tulsa, Oklahoma as the McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System. Through south Arkansas, the Ouachita River and the Saline River run roughly parallel to the Arkansas, and the major rivers in northeast Arkansas are the White River and St. Francis River. The Red River runs through the southwest corner of the state. Arkansas has many manmade lakes across the state, many are the basis for state parks, wildlife management areas, or other recreation. Bull Shoals Lake, DeGray Lake, Lake Dardanelle, Lake Ouachita all have state parks along their shores, and Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake, Greers Ferry Lake, Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine are also major recreation lakes in the state. The Ozarks is a broad term for many mountainous counties in northwest Arkansas. This region is usually referred to the Ozarks because the term Northwest Arkansas is the colloquial name for the Fayetteville‚ÄìSpringdale‚ÄìRogers Metropolitan Area, including Benton, Madison, Washington counties in Arkansas and McDonald County, Missouri. The Ozark, however, span from the Arkansas River in the south through north central Arkansas. The Boston Mountains subset contain highest peaks in the Ozarks. Location and size Location of Arkansas in the United States Arkansas is located in the southeastern United States, in the West South Central Census Bureau division. Arkansas covers an area of 53,179 square miles (137,733 km¬≤) and ranks as the 29th largest state by size. The state borders six U.S. states: Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi across the Mississippi River to the east, Louisiana to the south, Oklahoma to the west, and Texas to the southwest. First added to the United States of America as part of the Louisiana Territory of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Arkansas later became part of the Missouri Territory upon its establishment in 1812. This was further divided into the Arkansaw Territory on March 2, 1819 as everything south of Parallel 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ north (except the Missouri Bootheel) to the Louisiana state line. This new territory also included most of present-day Oklahoma until gaining its current boundaries in the 1840s. The slight oddity in Arkansas's western boundary results from a dispute with the Choctaw Nation in 1824. The Choctaws wanted the western boundary of Arkansas to start 100 paces east of Fort Smith and run south to the Red River, claiming the land had little timber and poor soil. Despite protests from Henry Conway, President James Monroe signed the bill into law on January 20, 1825. =Regions= Arkansas's regions are defined using many different criteria. Distinct natural regions of Arkansas include The Ozarks, Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas River Valley, Gulf Coastal Plain, Crowley's Ridge, the Arkansas Delta, Arkansas Timberlands, and Central Arkansas. Arkansans usually identify as being from one of five regions: northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, or central Arkansas. These directional regions are not specifically defined by county. Northwest Arkansas Carroll County in the heart of the Ozarks. Northwest Arkansas contains the southern half of the Ozarks, including the steeper Boston Mountains and the more gentle Springfield Plateau. These mountains are heavily forested by an oak-hickory ecosystem and less than 25% has been cleared for agriculture. The Ozark National Forest, administered by the National Forest Service, preserves of land in northwest Arkansas, including Arkansas's highest point, Mount Magazine in Mount Magazine State Park. Also within northwest Arkansas is the Arkansas River Valley including the tri-peaks tourist region of Mount Nebo, Mount Magazine, Petit Jean Mountain, and Lake Dardanelle. Federal and state protected areas such as the Buffalo National River, Buffalo National River Wilderness, Bull Shoals‚ÄìWhite River State Park, and Hobbs State Park ‚Äì Conservation Area preserve the northwest Arkansas Ozarks in their natural state. Population is anchored by the Fayetteville‚ÄìSpringdale‚ÄìRogers Metropolitan Area and Fort Smith metropolitan area, with sparsely populated mountainous areas defining the remainder of the region. The Ozark culture, such as Ozark Folk Festival held annually in Mountain View, defines much of the rural parts of northwest Arkansas. The Ozark Folk Center in Mountain View is dedicated to preserving northwest Arkansas's folk heritage. Other cultural centers are Bentonville, home to Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and Fayetteville, home to the University of Arkansas and Walton Arts Center. Northeast Arkansas Lake Frierson State Park is atop Crowley's Ridge in northeast Arkansas Northeast Arkansas is generally characterized as the area east of the Ozark Mountains and north of Interstate 40. The land is adjacent to the Mississippi River and generally flat, fertile, swampy lands sometimes called the Arkansas delta. The exception is Crowley's Ridge, a geological remnant from the Pleistocene era that raises around above the surrounding delta lowlands. Crowley's Ridge is more populated than the sparsely populated delta, including larger cities Jonesboro, Paragould, Forrest City, and Wynne. Primary waterways in the region include the Cache River, St. Francis River, and the Black River. Protected areas of northeast Arkansas include Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge, Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Charles State Park, and Lake Poinsett State Park. Tourists can explore some of the local Native American culture at the Nodena Site, Parkin Archaeological State Park, and Hampson Museum State Park. Following settlement, most of the area relied on cotton as the primary cash crop, and was home to many powerful plantation owners in the antebellum period. After the Civil War, agriculture became based on sharecropping and tenant farming, allowing plantation owners to keep their workers in poverty and maintain their political power. Much of this history is alive today at museums like the Southern Tenant Farmers Union Museum in Tyronza. The rivers served as highways for commerce and communication in the early days, and steamboat towns of days past have been restored for visitors to enjoy, including Jacksonport State Park and Powhatan Historic State Park along the Black River. Davidsonville Historic State Park preserves one of the state's first settlements as a frontier town, also located on the Black River. The primary population center of the region is the Jonesboro metropolitan area, with Jonesboro serving as the principal city. Southeast Arkansas Flat land in cultivation, such as this in Desha County, is typical of Southeast Arkansas Southeast Arkansas is generally characterized as the area east of Little Rock and south of Interstate 40\\\\. The land is adjacent to the Mississippi River and generally flat, fertile, swampy lands sometimes called the Arkansas delta. This region is sparsely populated, with an economy primarily driven by agriculture. The western side of Southeast Arkansas includes the Piney Woods, a region known for dense pine and cypress forests. Silviculture and agriculture are prominent in this section of the region. Population centers include Pine Bluff, Stuttgart, Monticello, Warren and Crossett. Primary waterways in the region include the Arkansas River, Bayou Bartholomew, Mississippi River and the White River. Protected areas of southeast Arkansas include Cane Creek State Park, Delta Heritage Trail State Park, Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Chicot State Park, Mississippi River State Park, Overflow National Wildlife Refuge and White River National Wildlife Refuge. The flat topography and fertile soils of Southeast Arkansas have been important to the region throughout its history, first to the Native American that inhabited the region. This history is available today at museums like the Pine Bluff/Jefferson County Historical Museum. The area was one of the first explored and settled in Arkansas; including the territorial capital at Arkansas Post. Following widespread settlement, most of the area was put into cotton cultivation due to the region's fertile soils. The staple's high market value made many plantation owners wealthy in the antebellum period; this history is available to visitors at museums such as the Lakeport Plantation. After the Civil War, agriculture became based on sharecropping and tenant farming, allowing plantation owners to keep their workers in poverty and maintain their political power and social dominance. In the 1950s, mechanization reduced the need for laborers on the farm, driving much of the region's population elsewhere in order to find jobs. Throughout much of Southeast Arkansas, population has continued to decline and economies have continued to shrink ever since. The primary population center of the region is the Pine Bluff metropolitan area, with Pine Bluff serving as the principal city. Southwest Arkansas Southwest Arkansas is largely covered in a thick pine, hickory, and oak forest known as the Piney Woods, with much of the land being preserved in the Ouachita National Forest. Manmade lakes dot the region, including Lake Ouachita, Lake Hamilton, Millwood Lake, and DeGray Lake. Population centers include Hot Springs, a popular tourist destination known for the natural hot springs protected within Hot Springs National Park, Oaklawn Park, and historic buildings, and Texarkana, which straddles the Texas state line in the southwest corner of Arkansas. Most of Southwest Arkansas is sparsely populated, with small towns separated by long roadways through stands of pine trees. Hydrology Rainfall in Arkansas is split almost in half along a northeast/southwest dividing line by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, with the northeast being characterized as arid-semiarid climate and the southwest being a Gulf-influenced humid-subhumid climate. The area that receives the most rain in the state is the area south of the Ouachita Mountains, which forms an orographic effect (commonly known as rain shadow) when storms move north from the Gulf. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) also describes Arkansas's water resources using six ecoregions. Of the six, the Boston Mountain, Ouachita Mountain and Ozark Highlands ecoregions generally contain waterways with \\"exceptionally high quality water\\", including many of the state's extraordinary resources waters (ERWs). The Arkansas River Valley, Gulf Coastal and Delta ecoregions have seen water quality impacts from agriculture and silviculture but are generally compliant with the goals of the Clean Water Act. =Surface water= Arkansas contains approximately of surface waters, including of perennial streams and of total streams. ADEQ uses six ultimate receiving streams to subdivide the state into primary watersheds: Arkansas River, Mississippi River, Ouachita River, Red River, St. Francis River, and White River. This six basins collect water from over 1600 smaller watersheds throughout the state via tributary streams, as described below. *Arkansas River: flows south-southeast, roughly bisecting the state. Major tributaries include Bayou Meto, Cadron Creek, Fourche LaFave River, Petit Jean River, Poteau River and Illinois River. *Mississippi River: flows south and forms much of the state's eastern boundary on its way to the Gulf of Mexico.

In many upland regions of Arkansas, surface water interacts with groundwater via karst topography common to the Ozarks and Ouachitas. Groundwater monitoring is subdivided into twelve areas. Of the twelve, the Athens Plateau (Hempstead County), Frontal Ouachita, Hardy, Omaha, Ouachita, North Central, and Pine Bluff monitoring areas have a water quality described as \\"generally good\\". Protected areas View from Mather Lodge at Petit Jean State Park Arkansas has many protected natural areas administered by several different organizations. The Ozark Mountain forests have been subdivided into the Ozark National Forest, St. Francis National Forest, and the Ouachita National Forest, maintained by the United States Forest Service. The Forest Service also maintains the Black Fork Mountain Wilderness, Blanchard Springs Caverns, and several other recreational areas within the forests. Administered by the National Park Service (NPS), Hot Springs National Park was the nation's first national park. The park includes Bathhouse Row, a formerly bustling avenue of Gilded Age architecture bathhouses which used the spring water to cure dozens of ailments. The NPS also maintains three National Historic Sites in Arkansas: Fort Smith National Historic Site, Little Rock Central High School, and the President Clinton Birthplace. Pea Ridge National Military Park is the only National Military Park, and Arkansas Post National Memorial is the lone National Memorial in the state. The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism maintains 52 state parks in Arkansas as well as Poison Springs State Forest. Parks range from large forested areas for hiking enthusiasts, to lakes and rivers for watersports, to interpretive historical sites, to cemeteries celebrating historically significant Arkansans. Some of the most frequently visited parks include Mount Magazine State Park, DeGray Lake Resort State Park, Crater of Diamonds State Park, Pinnacle Mountain State Park, Petit Jean State Park, Devil's Den State Park, Crowley's Ridge State Park, and Lake Ouachita State Park.

Williams (front) in a file photo from the 1960s. Isaac W. Williams (1945-2008), born in Charleston, South Carolina, was an activist with the NAACP.  Early life and education  Williams was born the seventh child of eleven in the predominantly African-American Union Heights area of Charleston, South Carolina.Interview with Isaac W. \\"Ike\\" Williams: Robert J. Moore Civil Rights Oral History Project (Jan 30, 2003) Williams graduated from Bonds- Wilson High School in Charleston County in 1963. He also graduated from South Carolina State College with a degree in biology. The Army ROTC commissioned Williams in 1967, and he served on active duty in the United States from 1967-69.  NAACP activism  = Early civil rights movement = Williams was a prolific NAACP activist throughout his life, particularly during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. His participation in protest actions such as sit-ins resulted in his being jailed over 17 times during that time. His efforts focused on police use of force, inadequate minority housing, and minority education, among other things. Williams's involvement with the NAACP started around 1960 when he was in tenth grade at Bonds-Wilson. At that time, he served as president of the North Charleston youth chapter of the NAACP. In a 2003 interview, he recalled arranging for civil rights lawyer Matthew J. Perry to give a speech for his chapter in 1960, describing it as a significant formative event for him. During his college years, Williams served as the president of the NAACP's South Carolina Conference Youth Division from 1963-1967, as well as chairman of the NAACP National Youth Work Committee in the 1965-1967. In 1967, as senior class president, he led a student uprising at South Carolina State University (then South Carolina A&M; College), protesting college president Benner C. Turner. The protest lasted two weeks and approximately 80% of the student body participated. Turner resigned in 1968 as a result of the pressure. = Later years = From 1969-1983, Williams was the Field Director of the NAACP in South Carolina. In March 1982, Williams was arrested on gambling and drug charges with five other men following a raid on the home of his friend, Willie Fleming. The drug charges against all the men were dropped shortly after the arrests. The gambling charges were dismissed on April 27, 1982 but were refiled on April 29. Williams described the refiling as harassment and stated he felt the police were overreacting to the situation. Williams and his co-defendants were acquitted of all charges on June 18, 1982. He described it as a learning experience, stating it taught him a lesson about the amount of scrutiny that black leaders are under.  Political campaigning  In 1991, Williams led the election campaign for Rep. Jim Clyburn. After Clyburn was elected, Williams served as his chief congressional aide. Williams held the position until his death from a stroke in 2008.

The abbey is famous for its spiritual life, characterised by prayer, reading, and manual work, the three basic elements of Trappist life. It has also a reputation for its brewery, one of several producers of Trappist beer in Belgium. History Procession of the Holy Blood in Bruges: Abbot Van Hecke with one of his monks =9th to 18th centuries= The earliest traces of a monastic presence at the location of the present day abbey date back to 1260, although the ', which is mentioned in a deed of 806 (from the abbey of Saint-Omer), was probably located in the same area (known at that time as Fletrinio). From 1260 to 1355 there was a small community of nuns on the side of the Catsberg. That site was abandoned, but between 1610 and 1784 a monastery of the Bridgettines (the Order of the Most Holy Saviour) was located on what is called \\"Fathers' Corner\\". =19th century= In 1831 the hermit Jan-Baptist Victoor was joined by a prior and a few monks in the woods of Saint Sixtus, and this group developed into the later Trappist abbey of Saint Sixtus in Westvleteren. In 1838 the Westvleteren Brewery was founded inside the abbey precinct. In 1839 a primary school was established and in 1840 the old church of the priory was built. In 1850, a group of monks from Westvleteren founded Scourmont Abbey on the barren plateau of Scourmont near Chimay. In 1871 the priory was granted the status of abbey by Pope Pius IX. Between 1875 and 1878 a model farm was developed as an example for the region. =20th century= During World War I the abbey provided shelter to many refugees from the region and in addition almost 400,000 allied soldiers lived in and around the abbey. World War II was a difficult time for the monastery in several respects. After the war, in 1945, the abbot decided to reduce the capacity of the brewery to produce only 4,800 hectolitres a year. In 1964 the guesthouse was built, and a new abbey church was added in 1968. Sources * Monks of Westmalle Abbey, 1904: Geschiedenis der Abdij van het Heilig Hart van Jezus te Westmalle (p.135).

Michigan consists of two peninsulas surrounded primarily by four of the Great Lakes and a variety of nearby islands. The Upper Peninsula is bounded on the southwest by Wisconsin, and the Lower Peninsula is bounded on the south by Indiana and Ohio. Both land masses are also separated from the Canadian province of Ontario by waterways of the Great Lakes, and from each other by the Straits of Mackinac. Because its land is largely surrounded by the Great Lakes, which flow into the Saint Lawrence River, Michigan is the only U.S. state whose streams and rivers are almost entirely within the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed. Michigan's territorial waters include roughly half each of Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Huron, and smaller areas of Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie. It includes an estimated 11,000 inland lakes. It encompasses of land, of Great Lakes waters, and of inland waters. Its territorial waters are second in area only to those of Alaska. At a total area of ‚Äì including those territorial waters ‚Äì Michigan is the largest state east of the Mississippi River, and the eleventh largest state overall. More than half of the state's land area ‚Äì ‚Äì is still forest. The state lies roughly between 41¬∞ and 49¬∞ north latitude, and between 82¬∞ and 91¬∞ west longitude. Upper Peninsula Upper Peninsula of Michigan Tahquamenon Falls in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west. The Porcupine Mountains, which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world, rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette, is Mount Arvon at 1,979 feet (603 m). The peninsula is as large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. The geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state. Ironwood, in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 highway miles (1,015 km) from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the U.P. culturally and economically distinct. Lower Peninsula Regions in the Lower Peninsula. Petoskey The Lower Peninsula, shaped like a mitten, is 277 miles (446 km) long from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west and occupies more than two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet (520 m), or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac. The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m). A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb. This peninsula projects out into Lake Huron and the Saginaw Bay. The geography of the Thumb is mainly flat with a few rolling hills. Other peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula, making up the Copper Country region of the state. The Leelanau Peninsula lies in the Northern Lower Michigan region. See Also Michigan Regions  Great Lakes  Aerial view of Sleeping Bear Dunes Little Sable Point Light south of Pentwater, Michigan. The Great Lakes that form most of the water boundary of Michigan are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior. Because of the historical importance of shipping on the lakes, Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, more than any other state. (see Lighthouses in the United States) The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana, sharing land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's northern boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers; then water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east. The northern boundary then runs completely through Lake Superior, from the western boundary with Minnesota to a point north of and around Isle Royale, thence traveling southeastward through the lake in a reasonably straight line to the Sault Ste. Marie area. In Southeastern Michigan there is a water boundary with Canada along the entire lengths of the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair (including the First Nation reserve of Walpole Island) and the Detroit River. The southeastern boundary ends in the western end of Lake Erie with a three-way convergence of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario. With the exception of two tiny areas on its borders ‚Äì one drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula, the other by way of the Kankakee- Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula ‚Äì the rivers and streams of Michigan drain entirely into the Great Lakes. The larger islands of Michigan include Isle Royale and Grand Island in Lake Superior; Neebish and Sugar islands in the St. Mary's River; Drummond Island, Les Cheneaux Islands, Mackinac Island, Bois Blanc Island, and Charity Island in Lake Huron; Beaver Island, the Fox Islands, North Manitoulin Island, and South Manitou Island in Lake Michigan; Harsens Island in Lake St. Clair; and Belle Isle and Grosse Ile in the Detroit River. Keweenaw Bay, Whitefish Bay, and the Big and Little Bay de Noc are the principal bays of the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and Little Traverse, Thunder, and Saginaw bays are found on the Lower Peninsula. After Alaska, Michigan has the longest shoreline of any state, . An additional can be added if islands are included. This roughly equals the length of the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida.  Inland lakes and rivers  The state has 11,037 inland lakes comprising of inland water. No point in Michigan is more than from an inland lake or more than from one of the Great Lakes. The state's numerous rivers are generally short and shallow, though several are navigable by recreational watercraft. The principal ones include the Au Sable, Thunder Bay, Cheboygan, and Saginaw, all of which flow into Lake Huron; the Ontonagon, and Tahquamenon, which flow into Lake Superior; and the St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Grand, Muskegon, Manistee, and Escanaba, which flow into Lake Michigan.

The state is home to three National Park Service preserves: Isle Royale National Park, located in Lake Superior, about southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario; Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, on the Lake Superior shore between Munising and Grand Marais; and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, on the Lake Michigan shore between the villages of Frankfort, Empire, and Glen Arbor. Other national protected areas in the state include: Keweenaw National Historical Park, Huron National Forest, Manistee National Forest, Hiawatha National Forest, Ottawa National Forest, Fumee Lake Natural Area, and Father Marquette National Memorial. The largest section of the North Country National Scenic Trail also passes through Michigan. With 78 state parks, 19 state recreation areas, and 6 state forests, Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state. These parks and forests include Holland State Park, Mackinac Island State Park, Au Sable State Forest, and Mackinaw State Forest.  Climate  Michigan map of K√∂ppen climate classification. Michigan USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map. Michigan has a humid continental climate, although there are two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa) with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (K√∂ppen Dfb), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February the state is frequently subjected to heavy lake-effect snow. The state averages from 30-40 inches (75‚Äì100 cm) of precipitation annually. The entire state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 tornadoes per year, which are more common in the extreme southern portion of the state. Portions of the southern border have been nearly as vulnerable historically as parts of Tornado Alley. Farther north, in the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare. srh.noaa.gov. Last accessed November 1, 2006.  Geology  Geologic map of the Michigan Basin. The geological formation of the state is greatly varied. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Permo-Carboniferous period. Devonian and sub- Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state. The soil is of a varied composition and in large areas is very fertile, especially in the south. However, the Upper Peninsula for the most part is rocky and mountainous, and the soil is unsuitable for agriculture. The climate is tempered by the proximity of the lakes and is much milder than in other locales with the same latitude. Ecology The principal forest trees include basswood, maple, elm, sassafras, butternut, walnut, poplar, hickory, oak, willow, pine, birch, beech, hemlock, witchhazel, tamarack, cedar, locust, dogwood, and ash.

Hughes is a Canadian religious studies scholar. He holds the Philip S. Bernstein Chair of Jewish Studies in the Department of Religion and Classics at the University of Rochester. Previously, he was the Gordon and Gretchen Gross Professor in the Institute of Jewish Thought and Heritage at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York from 2009-2012, and, from 2001-2009, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. Biography The first-born son of William (1927‚Äì2013) and Sadie (n√©e Alley, 1936‚Äì ) Hughes, Aaron was born on August 15, 1968, at the University Hospital in Edmonton, AB. His father is a native of Glasgow, Scotland and his mother was born in Fort Simpson, NWT. He also has a young brother, Cameron (1972‚Äì ). A first-generation college student, Hughes received a BA (hons) in Religious Studies at the University of Alberta in 1993. He worked primarily there with Francis Landy, a respected literary theorist who works on the Hebrew Bible. Following this, he went to the Department of Religious Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he received an MA in 1995 and a PhD in 2000 for a dissertation entitled \\"Philosophy's Mythos: Aesthetics, the Imagination, and the Philosophical Novel on Medieval Jewish and Islamic Thought. This was subsequently published as The Texture of the Divine: Imagination in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Thought (Indiana University Press, 2004), and which was one of three finalist for a Koret Jewish Book Award in the Thought/Philosophy category. His dissertation advisor was Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (now at ASU). In addition to his coursework at Indiana University, Hughes also spent a year, 1996-1997, at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a year, 1999-2000, at the University of Oxford. Work Hughes is a scholar of three distinct fields of research: Jewish philosophy, Islamic Studies and Theory and Method in the Academic Study of Religion. In terms of Jewish philosophy, Hughes has traditionally worked on medieval Jewish and Islamic Neo-Platonists, Avicenna, Abraham Ibn Ezra, and Ibn Tufayl. His work is particularly noted for its ability to discuss both the Hebrew and Islamic philosophers of the Jewish-Islamic symbiosis of medieval al-Andalus.The Texture of the Divine, Jonathn P. Decter, Jewish Quarterly Review 97.3 (2007) e82-e84 His work on Abraham Ibn Ezra is especially noted.Abraham Ibn Ezra, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn- ezra/ More recently Hughes has turned his attention away from a strict historicism to a hermeneutic that attempts to read premodern Jewish Philosophers in the light of modern ones (as can be seen, for example in his The Invention of Jewish Identity). In terms of Islamic Studies, Hughes has primarily been interested in critiquing what he regards as the overly apologetical and ecumenical approach to the field. This can be witnessed, for example in his two books that take aim at the field (Situating Islam and Theorizing Islam). However rather than just critique, Hughes has also attempted a corrective with his Muslim Identities, which is meant to be an attempt to provide an introduction to Islam in ways that eschews the more irenic approaches of people like Fred Denny and John Esposito. Writing in the Journal of Islamic Studies, Murad Wilfried Hofmann describes Hughes' Muslim Identities as \\"the very best introduction currently available in English for non-Muslims seeking a sound approach to Islam.\\" Hughes is also the editor-in- chief of Method and Theory in the Study of Religion (MTSR), the leading journal devoted to the subject. In addition, he is the Editor of the Academy Series, published by Oxford University Press for the American Academy of Religion, and co-editor for the Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers. Public dispute with Omid Safi In the 2012 book Theorizing Islam, Hughes had written critically about the scholarship of Omid Safi, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and other scholars in the academic study of Islam. In January 2014, Safi published a piece on the ezine Jadaliyya presenting his \\"impressions about the state of Islamic studies in the North American academy.\\" In the course of the article, in which he expressed his concern regarding unreconstructed orthodox Muslim voices entering the American academy, he stated that Hughes and two other scholars had written \\"pieces attacking and critiquing the prominence of Muslim scholars in the Study of Islam Section.\\" Specifically, he described Hughes book as \\"grossly polemical and simplistic.\\" In response, Hughes demanded that he \\"do what the Western tradition of scholarly discourse demands and respond to my ideas in print as opposed to engaging in innuendo and identity politics.\\" He further suggested that Safi may have been motivated by Hughes' position in Jewish studies, adding sarcastically, \\"[w]e all know that Jews are the arch-enemy of Islam.\\" Books =Written by Hughes= *Jacob Neusner on Religion: The Example of Judaism.

Carla Gavazzi was one of many talented Italian sopranos from the 1950s, who were eclipsed by the likes of Renata Tebaldi and Maria Callas. She possessed a powerful, warm and vibrant voice combined with expressive delivery and fine musicianship. She made her debut as Mimi in La boh√®me, in 1940, and sang throughout Italy in the standard lirico-spinto repertory, encompassing works by Mozart, Puccini and Verdi. She was also admired in contemporary works such as; Hindemith's Mathis der Maler, Malipiero's La favola del figlio cambiato, Respighi's La campana sommersa, Refice's Margherita da Cortona, Alfano's Cyrano de Bergerac and Risurrezione. Alfano also chose her for the premiere of his song cycle to poetry by Tagone. Gavazzi appeared in an Italian television production of Cavalleria rusticana in 1957 and in Jan Schmidt-Garre's film Opera Fanatic in 1998, and made a number of recordings with Cetra in the early 1950s such as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Nedda in Pagliacci, Adriana in Adriana Lecouvreur, and Minnie in La fanciulla del west. In 1959, family-related reasons caused her to retire from the stage. Sources * Musicweb-international.com, Christopher Howell, February 2003. * Opera News, Obituaries, August 2008.

The medical condition could be a disease, mental illness, disability, or simply a condition a person considers socially undesirable, such as baldness or lack of breast tissue. An incurable disease may or may not be a terminal illness; conversely, a curable illness can still result in the patient's death. The proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment, called the cure fraction or cure rate, is determined by comparing disease-free survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease. Another way of determining the cure fraction and/or \\"cure time\\" is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population. Inherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease. When a person has the common cold, and then recovers from it, the person is said to be cured, even though the person might someday catch another cold. Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as diabetes mellitus, so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured. Related concepts, whose meaning can differ, include response, remission and recovery.  Statistical model  In complex diseases, such as cancer, researchers rely on statistical comparisons of disease-free survival (DFS) of patients against matched, healthy control groups. This logically rigorous approach essentially equates indefinite remission with cure. The comparison is usually made through the Kaplan-Meier estimator approach. The simplest cure rate model was published by Joseph Berkson and Robert P. Gage in 1952. In this model, the survival at any given time is equal to those that are cured plus those that are not cured, but who have not yet died or, in the case of diseases that feature asymptomatic remissions, have not yet re-developed signs and symptoms of the disease. When all of the non-cured people have died or re- developed the disease, only the permanently cured members of the population will remain, and the DFS curve will be perfectly flat. The earliest point in time that the curve goes flat is the point at which all remaining disease-free survivors are declared to be permanently cured. If the curve never goes flat, then the disease is formally considered incurable (with the existing treatments). The Berkson and Gage equation is S(t) = p + [(1 -p) \\\\times S^*(t)] where S(t) is the proportion of people surviving at any given point in time, p is the proportion that are permanently cured, and S^*(t) is an exponential curve that represents the survival of the non-cured people. Cure rate curves can be determined through an analysis of the data. The analysis allows the statistician to determine the proportion of people that are permanently cured by a given treatment, and also how long after treatment it is necessary to wait before declaring an asymptomatic individual to be cured. Several cure rate models exist, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo model. It is possible to use cure rate models to compare the efficacy of different treatments. Generally, the survival curves are adjusted for the effects of normal aging on mortality, especially when diseases of older people are being studied. From the perspective of the patient, particularly one that has received a new treatment, the statistical model may be frustrating. It may take many years to accumulate sufficient information to determine the point at which the DFS curve flattens (and therefore no more relapses are expected). Some diseases may be discovered to be technically incurable, but also to require treatment so infrequently as to be not materially different from a cure. Other diseases may prove to have multiple plateaus, so that what was once hailed as a \\"cure\\" results unexpectedly in very late relapses. Consequently, patients, parents and psychologists developed the notion of psychological cure, or the moment at which the patient decides that the treatment was sufficiently likely to be a cure as to be called a cure. For example, a patient may declare himself to be \\"cured\\", and to determine to live his life as if the cure were definitely confirmed, immediately after treatment.  Related terms  ; Response: is a partial reduction in symptoms after treatment. ; Recovery:is a restoration of health or functioning. A person who has been cured may not be fully recovered, and a person who has recovered may not be cured, as in the case of a person in a temporary remission or who is an asymptomatic carrier for an infectious disease. ; Prevention:is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, disability, or disease in the first place, and generally it will not help someone who is already ill (though there are exceptions). For instance, many babies and young children are vaccinated against polio and other infectious diseases, which prevents them from contracting polio. But the vaccination does not work on patients who already have polio. A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started. ; Therapy:treats a problem, and may or may not lead to its cure. In incurable conditions, a treatment ameliorates the medical condition, often only for as long as the treatment is continued or for a short while after treatment is ended. For example, there is no cure for AIDS, but treatments are available to slow down the harm done by HIV and extend the treated person's life. Treatments don't always work. For example, chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer, but it may not work for every patient. In easily cured forms of cancer, such as childhood leukemias, testicular cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, cure rates may approach 90%. In other forms, treatment may be essentially impossible. A treatment need not be successful in 100% of patients to be considered curative. A given treatment may permanently cure only a small number of patients; so long as those patients are cured, the treatment is considered curative.  Examples  Cures can take the form of natural antibiotics (for bacterial infections), synthetic antibiotics such as the sulphonamides, or fluoroquinolones, antivirals (for a very few viral infections), antifungals, antitoxins, vitamins, gene therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and so on. Despite a number of cures being developed, the list of incurable diseases remains long. = 1700s = Scurvy became curable (as well as preventable) with doses of vitamin C (for example, in limes) when James Lind published A Treatise on the Scurvy (1753). = 1890s = Antitoxins to diphtheria and tetanus toxins were produced by Emil Adolf von Behring and his colleagues from 1890 onwards. The use of diphtheria antitoxin for the treatment of diphtheria was regarded by The Lancet as the \\"most important advance of the [19th] Century in the medical treatment of acute infectious disease\\". = 1930s = Sulphonamides become the first widely available cure for bacterial infections. Antimalarials were first synthesized, making malaria curable. = 1940s = Bacterial infections became curable with the development of antibiotics. = 2010s = Hepatitis C, a viral infection, became curable through treatment with antiviral medications.

Life The Sulzbach line was related to the Palatinate-Neuburg line who were Electors Palatine. The Elector of the Palatinate Charles III Philip failed to produce a legitimate male heir, as did his brothers. Joseph Charles, the eldest son of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach, was the heir apparent. On 2 May 1717 Joseph Charles married Countess Palatine Elizabeth Augusta Sophie of Neuburg (1693‚Äì1728), the daughter of Charles III Philip, a match intended to unite the two lines and prevented another succession war. However, all the sons fathered by the couple died in infancy and only three daughters survived. In 1728 Elizabeth Augusta died in childbirth and Joseph Charles died the following year in Oggersheim. Therefore, the inheritance of Palatinate-Sulzbach and the eventual inheritance passed to Joseph Charles' brother John Christian Joseph and his family.

His descendants played a significant role in the history of Bhutan. The Sacred Sites associated with Phajo Drugom Zhigpo and his descendants is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion. Biography =Early life= Just before he died, the founder of the Drukpa school, Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje told his nephew and Regent, Onre Darma Senge (1177‚Äì1237), \\"A Khampa son from Kham is coming. But he won't meet me. You look after him. Send him to the southern valley that has been visited and blessed by Orgyen Padma Jungne. He will be of great service to the Buddha Dharma.\\" Phajo Drugom Zhigpo was born, probably in 1184, at Yangtse Babchu (ryang tse 'bab chu), Tashigang in the Do-Kham region of East Tibet the youngest of three sons of the merchant Dabzang (zla-bzang), who belonged to a branch of the Gya (rgya) clan, and his wife Achi Palmo Kyid (a lce dpal mo skyid). His was originally named Dondrub Gyaltsen.don sgrub rgyal mtshan see: Dargye & S√∏rensen: 2001 p. 2 Phajo's Tibetan hagiography and Drukpa Kagyu religious histories from Bhutan relate various auspicious and miraculous signs accompanying his conception, gestation, and birth, and record that he was an obstinate and precocious child. At the age of seven he began his studies under a local Nyingma priest who taught him reading and writing. At the age of 12, he went to study with a Nyingma master named Tharpalingpa who gave him the complete set of lay devotees vows and the name Tarpa Gyaltsen. From this teacher he received and received instructions on generating the great thought of enlightenment, teachings on the Maha, Anu and Ati levels of Tantra, Dzogchen and in particular empowerment and teachings on \\"all the Cycles of MahƒÅkƒÅru·πáika\\"Dargye & S√∏rensen: 2001 p. 3-4(The Great Compassionate One a name of Avalokite≈õvara). He also received all the cycles and empowerments of the Eight Commandments (bka brgyad). From a lama he also received instructions on the texts Mahamudra Dispelling the Darkness of IgnoranceThis cannot be the text of the same name written by the 9th Karmapa (1556-1603) and a Ch√∂d text called The Profound Teaching of Object Cutting During a Single Sitting. Dargye & S√∏rensen: 2001 p. 4. Then he did prolonged meditation at Lingkar Drak, a place blessed by Guru Padmasambhava. =Meeting with Sangey Onre Darma Senge= One day he learned of the spiritual reputation of Tsangpa Gyare from some traders of Jang Taklung. Merely hearing the name of Tsangpa Gyare generated a deep sense of devotion in him and tears came to his eyes. Moved with great devotion, he made up his mind to go to Ralung to see Tsangpa Gyare. He sought his teacher's permission to go on a pilgrimage to Lhasa and Samye. After receiving the remaining instructions from his teacher, he set off on his journey. It took him almost a year to reach the U-Tsang region of Tibet. While in Samye, he heard the news of Tsangpa Gyare's passing away from two ascetics and he fainted. When he regained his senses, he heard about Onre Darma Sengye, the Regent of Tsangpa Gyare at Ralung, whose spiritual attainment was equal to that of Tsangpa Gyare. At the age of 33, Tharpa Gyaltsen arrived at Ralung. As instructed by Tsangpa Gyare, Onre Darma Sengye took him as his disciple and transmitted the teachings of the Drukpa Kagyu tradition. After receiving the teachings for about a year, Tharpa Gyaltsen meditated at Jekar and Longdol and \\"strenuously practiced meditation for three years and fully actualized the realization. In particular, he perfected his mastery of Mahamudra.\\"Dargye 2001. p 65 He then went back to his master Onre Darma Sengye and related his experiences and, impressed by his realization, Onre gave him the name Phajo Druggom Zhigpo and bestowed on him the complete empowerments and teachings of Rechungpa's Ear Whispered Transmission of Samvara (bde mchog snyan rgyud).Dargye & S√∏rensen: 2001 p. 15 At the appropriate time, Onre Darma Senye told Phajo about Tsangpa Gyare's prophecy and gave him instructions about his activities in Bhutan. In 1224, at the age of 40, Phajo left for Bhutan to carry out the prophecy of Tsangpa Gyare. =Activities in Bhutan= At the time of Phajo's arrival at Lingzhi, in Bhutan, a cow belonging to a local rich man named Matong Gyi, had given birth to a calf with the head of a donkey and a snake as the tail. He approached Phajo for help. Phajo subjugated the evil spirit and it became a normal calf. All the nomads of Lingzhi joined together and offered Jagoe Dzong and all the surrounding land to Phajo. Then Phajo meditated at Paro Taktsang for a month. In a vision during the meditation, Guru Padmasambhava instructed him to travel throughout the country and meditate at twelve places: *Four Dzongs (fortresses) - Taktsang Sengye Samdrub Dzong, Tago Choying Dzong, Lingzhi Jagoe Dzong and Yangtse Thubo Dzong; *Four Draks (rocks) - Gom Drak, Thukje Drak, Tsechu Drak and Dechen Drak *Four Phugs (caves) - Tsedong Phug, Gawa Phug, Langthang Phug and Sengye Phug. While staying at Darkar Latse, Phajo met Achog and took her as his consort. A son was born and given the name Dampa. When Phajo went to Wang Sinmo, he met Sonam Paldron, a girl with the signs of a Dakini, at Chagzam Bridge. Since meeting her had been prophesied to Phajo in a vision, he took her also as his consort. The bridge came to be known as Lungten Zampa, or the ‚ÄòBridge of the Prophecy‚Äô. Phajo gave her all the instructions and empowerments of the Drukpa tradition. Then they went to meditate at the cave Dodena, where Tago monastery stands today. In a vision during the meditation, Hayagriva instructed Phajo to continue his line through children to spread the traditions of the Drukpa lineage. After nine months Sonam Paldron gave birth to a daughter. Leaving his consort and daughter at Dodena, Phajo went to meditate at all the places prophesied. One day, while he was at the Dechen Drak, the string of his rosary broke and the beads scattered in all directions. This was an omen that his teachings would spread all over the country in the future. Prior to the arrival of Phajo Druggom, the followers of Nyoe Gyalwa Lhanangpa, a disciple of Kyobpa Jigten Sumgon (1143‚Äì1217), the founder of the Drikung Kagyud, known as Lhapa had great influence and controlled a large part of western Bhutan. However, the Phajo over came the dominance over Lhapa in the later periods. Sonam Paldron gave birth to seven sons. One day, Phajo took all seven sons to a bridge and, invoking the deities to decide which of his sons were demons and which would preserve his lineage, he threw all of them into the river. Three sons drowned and four remained unharmed. This story spread across the country and Lhakpas, the later holders of Lhanangpa's line of teaching (i.e. Dregung Kaguye) was said to have become envious and hostile as the parties sought dominance of the area. It was said that Lhapas sent a letter to Phajo saying, \\"You cannot spread your teaching without a mutual consent since I have started the teaching in this country for the first time. You should either look after the monastery of Jathel Dzong or serve as in a mutual way. Else we will have dispute\\". Phajo dismissed the threat and wrote back saying that he had been sent by Onre Darma Sengye in accordance with the prophecy of Tsangpa Gyare, to spread the teachings of the Drukpa lineage. Then the dispute erupted between the lhapas and Phajo, exchanging forces and power, where the Phajos effort made it to succession by over coming the Lhapas to spread the drukpa kagyued. When this news was conveyed to Noge Gelwa Lhanangpa, he said to his followers that, the drukpa spread was predestined for the small kingdom, while the rulers of the kingdom will remain from his lineage. Phajo began to spread the teachings of the Drukpa lineage systematically. He firmly established the Drukpa lineage teachings as the main school in western Bhutan and exerted considerable political and spiritual influence in the rest of the country. He passed on the teachings to his sons and sent them to different areas. They ruled according to the principles of the Dharma. In 1251, at the age of 68, Phajo died at Tago.

A. Daum, was a Dutch author of Dutch East Indies literature of the nineteenth century. The autodidact Daum was born in impoverished circumstances of a single mother in the Netherlands and did not enjoy much education. However, he had already written several short stories and was a journalist at Dutch newspapers before he moved to the Dutch East Indies in 1879. In 1879, he was appointed coeditor and later chief editor of the newspaper De Locomotief (The Locomotive) in Semarang on Java, and became editor-in-chief of Indisch Vaderland in 1883. When he came into conflict with the colonial authorities Daum moved to Batavia (now Jakarta) and founded the newspaper Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (Batavian Newspaper) in 1885. As owner, managing director and chief editor he made it one of the largest newspapers in the Dutch East Indies. His newspaper became a mouthpiece for the Indo (Eurasian) community of the Dutch East Indies. Its famous journalists and editors include his successor as chief editor Karel Zaalberg, as well as E. du Perron, Ernest Douwes Dekker and Tjalie Robinson. Daum's first novel Uit de suiker in de tabak (From Sugar to Tobacco), 1885, appeared originally as a serial in a newspaper in 1883‚Äì1884. His other well-known novels are Goena-goena (1889), Indische mensen in Holland (Indies People in Holland), 1890, and Ups en Downs in het Indische leven (Ups and Downs of Life in the Indies, 1892. Publishing his popular writings as a series in his newspaper, using the pseudonym Maurits, contributed significantly to its commercial success. It was after his death that P. A. Daum was acknowledged as one of the great authors of Dutch literature.

Excavations of Indian Knoll during The Great Depression, and research of the remains and artifacts in the 1960s-1970s demonstrated that its builders were greatly atypical of inhabitants of Archaic sites.Rothschild, Nan A. \\"Mortuary Behavior and Social Organization at Indian Knoll and Dickson Mounds\\". American Antiquity 44.4 (1979): 658‚Äì675. Archaic peoples were typically egalitarian, but burials at this knoll revealed that the inhabitants were divided into two social groups, irrespective of age or sex, and social class seems the most likely reason for this division. Background The Indian Knoll site, designated 15OH2, is located in the Ohio Valley of west central Kentucky near Green River. This area is known as the \\"shell mound region\\" because of the large shell middens, or deposits of shell that were disposed of by the indigenous people that lived there. Though there is evidence of earlier settlement, this area was most heavily occupied from approximately 3000‚Äì2000 BC, when the climate and vegetation were nearing modern conditions. This floodplain provided a stable environment, which eventually led to agricultural development early in the late Holocene era. In the early 20th century Clarence Bloomfield Moore was the first to explore a small portion of the land not being used for agricultural purposes. After the farm that occupied the site was destroyed by a flood, the land was opened for further excavation by William Snyder Webb in 1939. The study of this site has contributed towards an understanding of the social complexity of the southeastern cultures of the mid-late Holocene era. Excavations The original excavation in 1915 was led by C.B. Moore and his crew of eight men. He was the first to report on the bannerstone at Indian Knoll and recover 298 individuals, 66 of which were well preserved and sent to the United States National Museum. After the flood in 1937, Webb and his team began a second excavation, leading to the discovery of 880 more burials. The Indian Knoll skeletal population was inadequately evaluated by Moore, so in 1960, the remains were reassessed by Francis Johnston and Charles Snow. From the skeletal fragments, they estimated there to be at least 1,234 individuals, rather than 1,178 reported between Moore and Webb. Johnston and Snow concluded that Indian Knoll had a high infant mortality rate, mostly only under one year, but also many under four. The average life span was about 18.5 years old, with slightly more male burials than female. Initial excavation The 1939 excavations included trenches paralleling the Green River, which contained over 1000 burials, and evidence of ancient dwellings with clay flooring, six hearths, and what Webb noted as kitchen fireside tools, or artifacts such as hammerstones, grooved axes, pitted stones, mortars and pestles. There were also some 67,000 artifacts uncovered at Indian Knoll, some of which were carbon dated, and thought to be an average of about 5,300 years old. These dwellings are considered to be permanent occupations. The hearths were probably used for heating during the winter as well as cooking. The shell middens nearby contain not only the remains of the gastropod shells, but debris of animal bone and fire-cracked rock such as sandstone and river pebbles, probably used for cooking, boiling water, and processing walnuts, hickory nuts, and acorns. Burials and grave goods The earlier graves at Indian Knoll were found down to five feet into the sand, with the more recent burials inside the shell midden. The deepest were better preserved as a result of the moist sand, even some of the bony tissues and infant skeletons remained intact. The grave structure was usually small, round, and filled in with black midden debris. The burials inside the midden showed no sign of formal walls, thus it is likely that individuals were placed in shallow depressions and filled in with the surrounding shell midden. Many of the skeletons placed in shallow graves, especially the skulls, were crushed and shown signs of disturbance. Most of the skeletons were found in tight coiled positions, which indicates the bodies may have been wrapped, though there are a few instances of being placed sitting up, with even less fully extended . The large number of burials caused graves to intrude into others accidentally, though multiple burials were common practice during the time the shell midden formed between the years 5500 and 2000 BC. Multiple burials were also typically circular, but larger and lacked grave goods except for single projectile points near the chest cavities, which suggest violence near time of death. Many skeletons were found dismembered, either unintentionally or as an act of mutilation. If a grave happened to be dug intruding another, the original body may have become dismembered, but normally the bones would have been piled up and reburied. Occasionally pieces, such as skulls or limbs, were not recovered, which Robert Mensforth considered evidence for warfare and trophy taking. Grave goods were found within 187 burials, though shell beads, used for personal adornments or sewed on garments, were not counted as a deliberate grave goods in one study.[23] The artifacts commonly associated with graves include pestles, hammerstones, grooved axes, projectile points with a few cases of copper and stone vessels. There were 43 atlatl weights, also known as bannerstones for spear-thowers, associated with burials at Indian Knoll, and Webb's research focus when excavating this site to get more information on this particular grave good. Dog burials There were 21 dog burials, 17 of which were well preserved. The graves of dogs were given the same attention as human graves, with nine examples of dogs buried with humans at Indian Knoll. The dogs within human burials were associated with women and children, as much as with men. These dogs were apparently killed at the time of their owner's death and placed on top, below their feet, or at their side. According to Cheryl Claassen, at least six out of the ten dogs with humans show possible evidence of a violent death. The position of the human skeleton in these cases was usually face down and devoid of artifacts. The only double dog and face down human burial occurs with a female child about the age of five. Claassen also suggest that these dogs were not only beloved pets, but had symbolic and ritual significance. A similar belief about the healing nature of dogs is seen across Native American myths. Some interpretations held by the Cherokee are that dogs are spiritual guides and judges, that symbolized morality and were considered sacred. Another possible meaning considered by Claassen is that dogs were used to represent warriors whose bodies were never retrieved from war. This has been speculated because there were male dogs in single burials. Social complexity There are several indicators of long-distance contact with other Late Archaic groups present at the Indian Knoll site including exotic materials and signs of warfare. The social organization of Archaic cultures has been broadly stereotyped as being small band or tribal communities of hunter-gatherers, with few possessions and lacking permanent villages, food production, and pottery. These cultures typically determined social statuses by age, sex, and personal achievement, because there were little differences in wealth or possessions. Analysis of these artifacts and remains provide a better understanding of social organization during the late Archaic. Grave goods or tools were mainly associated men, but in this community women and children were with one or many artifacts. This suggests status was not restricted by age or sex, according to N. A. Rothschild. Some labor division is apparent, given the different types of artifacts commonly found among the two sexes. For example, men were buried with axes, stone and woodworking tools, fish hooks, and awls in contrast to the shells, bone beads and nut cracking stones usually found with females. The most abundant material found in graves were several types of shell, manufactured into a variety of forms, such as beads and buttons worn as personal adornments. Some of these species were not local, which could indicate wealth and status, and also shows evidence of long distant exchange networks with other Archaic cultures. The Busycon, Marginella, and Olivella shell species were imported from the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic coast, and were found at this site but rarely in burials which suggest they were probably considered valuable. A couple pieces of copper, another foreign material found at Indian Knoll, shows trade extending as far north as Lake Superior. Archaic trade networks took the form of what Claassen calls \\"down-the-line-transfer,\\" or resources and gifts were passed from village to village, rather than at large trade fairs. This informal exchange network seems more likely because it involved fewer individuals and had less influence over cultural traditions. By 2000 BC, regional variation in style of tools was visible, such as the variations in design and function of atlatl weights, or bannerstones used primarily to center the weight of a throwing stick. By this time, communities had well established control over territory and resources, causing an increase in tension and warfare. Relationships between neighbors are assumed to have had greater importance with the increases in exchange systems, and hunting or war parties. By 1000 BC status differentiation is noticeable in the grave goods. The degree of violence in the region is notable and many individuals showed signs of fatal injuries such as one scalping, a slit throat, and a skull smashed in. Also many had multiple puncture marks and fractured or missing bones, serving as evidence of warfare and trophy taking. Many of the dismembered bodies were missing skulls and limbs and were never recovered, indicating trophy taking. However, one trophy in the form of a human mandible was recovered from Indian Knoll. In all, it is estimated that the 12 incomplete skeletons may have presented as many as 34 human bone trophies to the opposing members. Most the injuries reported are caused from blunt force trauma, but were usually not fatal, suggesting well-defined rules to reduce death tolls for these organized war parties, rather than sporadic feuds. Pottery Technological developments such as crude ceramics were developed by Archaic societies early during the late Holocene. A total of 792 shards of pottery were found at Indian Knoll. All of which were shell or grit tempered, mainly found within the first foot and a half of the mound, and closely relate to the later Mississippian culture's pottery. Most vessels had wide mouths and curved or flat bases, which were handmade by building up coils of clay. Pottery contributed to the exploitation and manipulation of wild plants, and more efficiency in food processing and water storage. The most common type of ceramics were shell tempered, representing 78.5% of the total pottery shards found at Indian Knoll, with only 171 grit tempered shards of bowls or jars discovered. Heavy grit tempered pottery appeared in different regions of the Eastern Woodlands, including Ohio Valley, between 2000-500 BC. The grit tempered ceramics that were found show plain and cord marked ware, as well as simple stamped grooved patterns. Several different finishes on shell tempered ceramics were also noted. Nine shards found in one were also cord marked, or tapped with a twisted fibers wrapped paddle, and three shards show signs of roughening, which were individually created by a rectangular object. Other shards show signs of net impressions caused by mesh fabrics, which is common in much of western Kentucky. Agriculture The inhabitants of the Ohio Valley were complex hunter-gatherer societies who relied on food rich resources of the deciduous forest and floodplain, including both marine and terrestrial animals and plants. A constant crop of hickory nuts, acorns, roots, and seeds were utilized by the foragers of the area, as well as later domestication of squash in the Green River Region reveals an evident trend toward subsistence agriculture, though this has not been confirmed at Indian Knoll. This site was never fully excavated because of what Webb called, \\"difficulties arising from a shortage in the Works Progress Administration labor quota of the county,\\" but little area was left unexplored. In 1966 Indian Knoll was designated a National Historic Landmark, and today the site lies within 290 acres of private agricultural fields.

In this case the court had considered the question of the standard of care that should be applied to a learner driver, and whether it should be the same as is expected of an experienced driver. Facts Mr. Nettleship, the plaintiff (claimant), agreed to teach Mrs Weston, the defendant, to drive in her husband‚Äôs car, after he had inquired the insurance policy.[1971] 2 QB 691, at 698 During one of the lessons, the defendant lost control of the car and caused an accident in which the plaintiff was injured. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was well aware of her lack of skill and that the court should make allowance for her since she could not be expected to drive like an experienced motorist. Judgment The Court of Appeal, consisting of Lord Denning MR, Salmon LJ and Megaw LJ held that applying a lower standard to the learner driver because the instructor was aware of her inexperience would result in complicated shifting standards. It would imply, for example, that an inexperienced doctor owed his patient a lower standard of care if the patient was aware of his lack of experience. The standard of care for a learner driver would be the usual standard applied to drivers: that of an experienced and skilled driver.[1971] 2 QB 691, at 703 The policy consideration that played a role in this decision was that the learner driver was covered by insurance.[1971] 2 QB 691, at 699 Over the dissent of Salmon LJ, the Court of Appeal held that the instructor was also responsible for the accident as he was partially in control of the car and should only be able to recover half of his damages due to contributory negligence.

The home was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1966 for its role as the site of the world's first ovariotomy, performed without anesthesia by Dr. McDowell in 1809. Ephraim McDowell biography Ephraim McDowell (November 11, 1771 - June 25, 1830) was an American physician. He was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia and moved with his family to Danville, Kentucky in 1784. He studied under Dr. Humphrey in Staunton, Virginia, then attended lectures in medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, from 1793 to 1794 and studied privately with John Bell. In 1795. he returned from Scotland, settled in Danville, Kentucky and began his practice as a surgeon. Dr. McDowell played a prominent role in his community. He was a founder of Trinity Episcopal Church in Danville and a founder and original corporator of Centre College in Danville. Dr. McDowell became a member of the Philadelphia Medical Society in 1817. He removed a urinary stone and repaired a hernia for James K. Polk. On December 13, 1809, Dr. McDowell diagnosed an ovarian tumor in Jane Todd Crawford of Green County, Kentucky, In his house on Christmas morning, 1809, Dr. McDowell removed a tumor without anesthetic or antisepsis. Mrs. Crawford made an uncomplicated recovery, returning to her home 25 days later and living another 32 years. This was the first successful removal of an ovarian tumor in the world. House history The house was built in three stages. A brick ell was constructed 1792‚Äì1795. Dr. McDowell purchased it in late 1802. He added the front, clapboard portion in 1803‚Äì1804 and the small brick office to the left of the back porch in 1820. The house was remodeled at the same time. After McDowell's death in 1830 the house was sold. It was the home of a Centre College president for a short time. Later the entire area became slum and tenement property. The house deteriorated badly. Dr. August Schachner, of Louisville, led the efforts to buy the house for restoration. In 1921 he visited the house. \\"Since our last visit, the house has continued its downward course until it has reached a point where it now seems almost beyond redemption. The room that served as the original office of Dr. McDowell is now used as a shoe-shining booth for Negroes. The room in the rear of the corresponding front room on the second floor,\\"(the operating room) \\"which is on a lower level by several feet, is used as a dump for the ashes from the grates of the rooms on the second floor.\\" The Kentucky Medical Association bought the house in 1935 and deeded it to the state of Kentucky, who had it restored by Works Progress Administration (WPA). It was dedicated on May 20, 1939. In 1948, Kentucky returned the property to the Kentucky Medical Association. The Kentucky Pharmaceutical Society restored the Apothecary Shop in the late 1950s with help from the Eli Lily Foundation. It was furnished by the Pfizer Laboratories. It was dedicated and presented to the Kentucky Medical Association on August 14, 1959.

She studied with Emanuel Hahn at the Ontario College of Art and then attended the Royal College of Art in London, England. Her sculpture was exhibited at the Ontario Society of Artists and the Royal Canadian Academy in the 1930s and early 1940s. However, after her marriage to journalist Kenneth McNeill Wells, she devoted most of her time to the wood engraved illustration of his (and other's) books. In the early 1940s, Wells and Oille decided to leave Toronto and find a rural home. After searching the back roads of Simcoe County and its Medonte township, with a limited budget, they decided to salvage the timbers from an old log home and re-assemble it on a few acres of land purchased from a local farmer. While he wrote of the often humorous exploits of transplanted city folk for the Toronto Telegram newspaper, she began a series of wood engravings that were used in the hardcover collection of the articles known as The Owl Pen. This book, which went through many editions, was followed by four others written by Wells and illustrated by Oille, including The Moonstruck Two, a book about their trip down the Mississippi. As time passed in her career as a book illustrator, Oille began using scraperboard and linocut as being just as effective for illustration as the more demanding wood engraving. In the 1960s, the couple moved to Virginia for 18 years and then to The Bahamas. It appears that during this time away from Canada, Oille did not continue her art in any way and she was virtually forgotten in Canada despite the continued popularity of The Owl Pen. After Wells' death she returned to Canada in the early 1990s, living in Orillia, Ontario, very near her ancestral roots and the countryside of The Owl Pen.

It consisted only of officers who were handpicked from West Point and was used for mapping and the design and construction of federal civil works such as lighthouses and other coastal fortifications and navigational routes. Members included such officers as George Meade, John C. Fr√©mont and Stephen Long. It was merged with the United States Army Corps of Engineers on 31 March 1863, at which point the Corps of Engineers also assumed the Lakes Survey for the Great Lakes.Charting the Inland Seas: A History of the U.S. Lake Survey, Arthur M. Woodford, 1991 In the mid-19th century, Corps of Engineers' officers ran Lighthouse Districts in tandem with U.S. Naval officers. In 1841, Congress created the Lake Survey. The Survey, based in Detroit, Mich., was charged with conducting a hydrographical survey of the Northern and Northwestern Lakes and preparing and publishing nautical charts and other navigation aids. The Lake Survey published its first charts in 1852.Lake Survey Significance  William Goetzmann has written: Major expeditions prior to the Corps' creation In all, there were six major expeditions into the Louisiana Purchase, the first being the best known Corps of Discovery led by Lewis and Clark in 1804-1806. A second expedition in 1804 included astronomer and naturalist John Dunbar and prominent Philadelphia chemist William Hunter. This expedition attempted to follow the Red River to its source in Texas, then controlled by Spain, but turned back after three months. In April 1806 a second Red River Expedition was led by Captain Richard Sparks and included astronomer and surveyor Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis, a University of Pennsylvania medical student who served as the expedition's botanist. The group of 24 traveled 615 miles up the Red River before being turned back by Spanish authorities. President Thomas Jefferson hoped that this expedition would be nearly as important as the one led by Lewis and Clark, but the interruption by Spanish authorities prevented this hope from being realized. In 1805‚Äì1806, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike was ordered by General James Wilkinson, Governor of the Upper Louisiana Territory, to find the source of the Mississippi River. In 1806‚Äì1807, President Jefferson ordered Lieutenant Pike, on another expedition, to find the headwaters of the Arkansas River and Red River. This is better known as the Pike Expedition. Spanish forces arrested Pike and confiscated his papers, but assigned a translator and cartographer to translate Pike's documents. In 1817 Major Stephen H. Long explored the upper Mississippi River, selecting sites for Fort Smith on the Arkansas River and Fort St. Anthony at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi. In 1819, President James Monroe and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun ordered General Henry Atkinson to lead what became known as the Yellowstone Expedition. One objective was to eliminate British influence among the Native American tribes in the region. Nearly 1,000 soldiers were transported by five steamboats up the Missouri River to the Mandan villages at the mouth of the Yellowstone, where they built a fort. This was the first known use of steam propulsion in the west.

It is located just off the Commercial Road (A13) approximately one mile (1.6 km) east of the City of London. The square is currently laid out as a formal garden with mature trees and planting and is surrounded on two sides by elegant early 19th century townhouses. Arbour Square was laid out as a garden enclosure in 1819. By 1830, contemporary maps show buildings on all sides of the square and many of the surrounding roads.Greenwood's Map of London, second edition (1830) The south and west sides of the square are still made up of the original three and four storey Georgian townhouses which are Grade II listed. The east side was demolished and replaced by the Raine's School building (also Grade II listed) in 1913, while the terrace on the north side was replaced by a block of flats in 1937.London Borough of Tower Hamlets Conservation Area Character Appraisals and Management Guidelines The Raine's School building now houses part of Tower Hamlets College. The school building was entirely refurbished in 1994 by Sprunt Architects, featuring a new open learning centre within the listed heart of the building. Running north from the square on the west side is West Arbour Street; and running north on the east side is East Arbour street which is a smaller two storey Georgian terrace. The former Arbour Square police station which once held the Kray Twins and alleged Provisional Irish Republican Army terrorists is located between these two streets; it closed in 1999 and has recently been redeveloped into flats. Arbour Square is mirrored on the opposite side of commercial road by Albert Gardens, and impressive and almost fully intact late-Georgian residential square made up of Grade II listed houses. Originally named Albert Square, it was built in the early 1840s, and renamed Albert Gardens in 1937. In 1899 there was a proposal to build houses on the central garden in the square but the London County Council compulsorily purchased the land and opened Albert Square Garden to the public in 1906. In the north of the garden is a 19th- century drinking fountain topped by a statue, 'Shepherd Boy', which was erected in 1903 by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association [London Gardens Directory http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online- record.asp?ID=THM001] Together with the neighbouring Havering Street which contains smaller but also Grade II listed houses, and several other early 19th century terraces on the Commercial Road, Albert Gardens and Arbour Square became part of the Albert Gardens Conservation area in 1969.

B√ºtler worked for the care of the poor in these places until her exile from Ecuador and entrance into Colombia where she worked for the remainder of her life. Her order moved there with her, and continued to expand during her time there until her death. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 29 October 1995, and canonised by Pope Benedict XVI on 12 October 2008. The cause for canonisation had commenced under Pope Paul VI in 1974, in which she was titled as a Servant of God; she was named as Venerable in 1991, before her beatification and canonisation. Life Photograph c. 1865. Verena B√ºtler was born in mid-1848 in Switzerland as the fourth of eight children to the farmers Henry and Catherine; she was baptized right after her birth. Her great-grandparents were Jeremias B√ºtler and Elisabeth Hoffmann; all her siblings were girls and one - Martina (1856‚Äì90) - became a Benedictine nun. She made her First Communion on 16 April 1860 after having received her Confirmation in 1856. She finished school in 1862. B√ºtler became engaged at some stage to a man she loved but experienced a sudden religious experience that prompted her to break off her engagement in order to reflect on possible entrance into the religious life. She at first tried to enter the Sisters of the Holy Cross of Menzingen in 1866 but left it after a brief period in order to return home and to discern her true calling. B√ºtler joined the Franciscan Capuchin nuns at the convent of Mary Help of Sinners in Altst√§tten - at the encouragement of her local pastor - on 12 November 1867 and assumed the religious name of \\"Mar√≠a Bernarda\\" and the habit on 4 May 1868 before making her solemn profession later on 4 October 1871. She served as novice mistress from 1879 to 1880 and the superior of her house from 1880 until 1886. B√ºtler left for the missions in Ecuador on 19 June 1888 with six others and arrived on 29 July; there, she founded a religious congregation dedicated to the spirit of evangelic zeal. In 1895 the period of anti- religious sentiment forced her and her fellow religious out of the nation to Colombia; she and fourteen others received an invitation from Bishop Eugenio Biffi to work in Cartagena in Colombia and Biffi received them on 2 August 1895. Her order received diocesan approval on 12 January 1912 as well as the decree of praise and papal approval from Pope Pius XI on 30 April 1929 and 5 July 1938. Her order was aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 26 June 1905. B√ºtler died in mid-1924. The pastor of the cathedral announced her death: \\"A saint has died in this city this morning: the reverend Mother Bernarda!\\" Her order now operates in nations such as Brazil and Liechtenstein. Her remains were later relocated in 1956. In 2005 there were 788 religious in a total of 125 houses. Canonization Beatification of B√ºtler in 1995. The sainthood process opened in Cartagena in an informative process that opened in 1949 and later concluded in 1952 while a team of theologians collated and approved all of her spiritual works and other writings on 8 May 1959; the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 15 July 1974 and she was titled as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was held from 1976 until 1977 and these processes received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 26 February 1982. The C.C.S. received the Positio in 1988 and it led to theologians approving its contents on 5 April 1991 while the C.C.S also voted in favor of the cause on 15 October 1991. Pope John Paul II named her as Venerable on 21 December 1991 after confirming her heroic virtue. The miracle for beatification was investigated and then validated on 4 May 1992 while a medical board approved it on 17 June 1993; theologians also approved it on 26 November 1993 as did the C.C.S. on 18 January 1994. John Paul II approved this miracle on 26 March 1994 and later beatified her on 29 October 1995 in Saint Peter's Basilica. The beatification miracle was the rebuilding of missing cranial bones of the 15-day-old Liliana Sanchez in 1969. Rosmarie Wicki-B√ºtler and Burkard B√ºtler - her grandniece and grandnephew - represented the family at the 1995 beatification. The second miracle was investigated in 2003 in Cartagena and later received validation on 15 October 2004. The medical board approved it on 23 March 2006 as did theologians on 1 December 2006 and the C.C.S. on 17 April 2007. Pope Benedict XVI approved it on 6 July 2007 and later canonized her as a saint on 12 October 2008 in Saint Peter's Square. The miracle was the 2 July 2002 cure of Myrna Jazime Correa from severe respiratory complications.

Gillis was an everyman with the rank of private whose career was tracked on the cover of the Post from induction through discharge without being depicted in battle. He and his girlfriend were modeled by two of Rockwell's acquaintances. Gillis was not exclusively used on Post covers, but the Willie Gillis series of covers was a hallmark of Rockwell's wartime work. Rockwell was in his prime, and the Post was at the peak of its popularity with a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed that Gillis was a real person. Rockwell's wartime art contributed to the success of the wartime bond sales efforts, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms, and Rosie the Riveter. The Gillis series has been included in two major Rockwell tours since 1999. It toured as part of a Rockwell Post cover art retrospective from 1999 to 2002, and as part of a 1940s World War II Rockwell art exhibition from 2006 to 2010.  Background  From 1916 through his John F. Kennedy memorial cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, which was the most popular American magazine of the first half of the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million. Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American character who served as one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II soldier. Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theater of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as \\"an inoffensive, ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war\\". The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the \\"little guy\\" living up to a sense of duty in this time of war. Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 ‚Äì May 1, 1943. The Gillis character endures generations later for literary and artistic comparison.  Post Illustrations  Willie Gillis in Convoy (1943) was a depiction of Gillis close to the battlefield that was not used as cover art. Willie Gillis in College (October 5, 1946) broke with the style of the wartime posters, depicting Gillis as a civilian in a peaceful environment. = Series review = In Willie Gillis: Food Package, Gillis' 1941, he toted a care package. Ten subsequent covers depicted Gillis in a variety of roles: at church in uniform, holding his hat on his lap; the soldier on K.P. duty; the son carrying on the family tradition of military service; a still life of Gillis' family photographs; and two fighting mad girls, holding pictures of Gillis that he'd sent each of them from the war zone. Gillis matured over the course of the series until he was almost unrecognizable in the final work. Rockwell created a good ending for the series by depicting Gillis relaxing while studying at college on the G.I. Bill: \\"We know that things ended well for Gillis, though; his final cover in 1946 showed the young man stretched in a windowsill smoking a pipe and wearing penny loafers, studying at Middlebury College.\\" To some, the fourth piece ‚Äì Willie Gillis: Hometown News ‚Äì was the one that cemented Willie Gillis' place in American history, because families identified with Gillis. The sixth piece, Willie Gillis in Church, is the earliest of his works with significant religious themes. This final component of the series, Willie Gillis in College, engenders much critical review because it is perceived to represent a transformation of character. It is owned by the Washington Mutual Bank of Seattle. In 2000, they loaned it to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. It is a study in contrast of mood and style from the wartime components of the series. Throughout the cover series Gillis was never pictured in battle or in any sort of danger, armed or with armed foes because Rockwell felt those portrayals were better exhibited by newsreels and photographs. Rockwell produced at least one depiction of Gillis that was not on the cover. The painting Willie Gillis in Convoy was produced in 1943, depicting Gillis, in combat gear, in the back of a covered military vehicle with his rifle in hand. Rockwell donated the painting to the Gardner High School for the graduating class, where it hung in the principal's office until 2000. The school then loaned it to the Gardner Museum. A charcoal sketch of the painting sold for $107,000 in 1999. There was concern that the painting was not hung in a secure location. In 2005, the painting was restored and rehung at the high school. In 2014, it was sold for $1.9 million, with the proceeds used to create a foundation to benefit the schools in Gardner.\\"Norman Rockwell painting yields $1.9 million for Gardner\\", Worcester Telegram & Gazette, May 21, 2014 = Models = Robert Otis Buck served as Rockwell's model for Gillis and eventually enlisted for service in the Navy. His job in Arlington was as a sawmill hand.Murray and McCabe, p. 11. He met Rockwell to pose the first time when he was 15, and he stood tall and had a lock of hair that dropped down on his forehead. Rockwell had been seeking a model, and he met Buck at a square dance in Arlington, Vermont. Rockwell observed him from different angles during the dance, and Buck told him that he would \\"knock him flat\\" if he did not stop staring. Buck had been exempted from the military draft, but he felt that serving his country was his patriotic duty and enlisted as a naval aviator in 1943. cited at He served in the South Seas during the war. Rockwell worked from memory and photographs to complete his illustrations while Buck was overseas, and sometimes he only worked Gillis into the background via a photograph on the wall. He was going to discontinue the series, but Post editors objected because his character was too popular. cited at The public enjoyed closely scrutinizing Gillis' affairs. Gillis was so popular that the Post received hundreds of letters inquiring about his tribulations, as many perceived him as real, and concern was particularly high among families named Gillis. The model who portrayed Gillis' girlfriend was Post illustrator Mead Schaeffer's daughter. She remained available despite Buck's departure, so Rockwell painted her faithfully sleeping at midnight on New Year's Eve with photos of Willie Gillis in the background above her bed in Willie Gillis: New Year's Eve. The subsequent √ó Willie Gillis cover was Willie Gillis: Generations depicting the Gillis military family in pictures above a bookshelf of Gillis war books. It generated hundreds of letters from Gillises, many of whom wanted to buy the imaginary books. Mead's daughters Lee and Patty Schaeffer showed vying affections for Gillis in one Post cover.Murray and McCabe, p. 16.  Modern references  The woman who posed for illustrations of Gillis' girlfriend was included in the 90-minute PBS American Masters series film Norman Rockwell: Painting America. The film coincided with the first comprehensive Rockwell touring exhibition, entitled Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People, which was a seven-city tour. The High Museum of Art and the Norman Rockwell Museum produced the exhibition that started at the High Museum on November 6, 1999, stopped at the Chicago Historical Society, Corcoran Gallery of Art, San Diego Museum of Art, Phoenix Art Museum, and Norman Rockwell Museum before concluding at the Solomon R.

During the first 16 days of the fair, through Saturday September 28, the attendance was 1,052,511. From 2006 through 2010 Gillis appeared along with the Four Freedoms and Rosie The Riveter in a travelling exhibition entitled Norman Rockwell in the 1940s: A View of the American Homefront.

Built in 1925, it is notable for its association with the American effort to professionalize midwifery, led by Mary Breckinridge (1881-1965). It was headquarters of the Frontier Nursing Service, an organization which continues today. Wendover was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1991 for this role. It now serves as a bed and breakfast inn and retreat operated by the Service's success, Frontier Nursing University. Description and history Wendover is located in a rural setting about south of Hyden, Kentucky on a south-facing hillside, overlooking the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River. The principal building of the complex now on the property is a 2-1/2 story log structure covered with gabled roofs. It is roughly laid out as two wings joined by a central section, having begun as a traditional dogtrot house. Two large stone chimneys project through the main roof line. Windows are typically of the casement style, with larger windows in the more public spaces of the ground floor. Mary Breckinridge, a Tennessee native, was exposed from a relatively early age to both midwifery and nursing, formally studying the latter in the early 1900s. During the First World War she was exposed to rural community health services in Scotland, an idea she thought to transfer to rural parts of the United States. She chose rural eastern Kentucky in part for its daunting logistical difficulties. Wendover became her home and a training facility for a network of clinics she established in the region. The Frontier Nursing Services is now based out of facilities in Hyden, and its training service is now Frontier Nursing University. with The Wendover property now serves as a retreat center and bed-and-breakfast inn.

It explores the life and times of Jesse James and his gang, and his death at the hands of Robert Ford. Plot The title is based on a folk song of the era. Based on extensive research into the many contemporary accounts of Jesse James' crimes and personal life, the novel weaves a third-person narrative of actual events with fictionalized imaginings of the lives of Jesse, his brother Frank, and their followers, including their guerrilla activities during the American Civil War and their insurgency afterward as notorious bank and train robbers. Though the James brothers achieved folk-hero fame for claims that they openly shared the loot from their robberies, the novel reveals they kept all the money for themselves. Late in their career, the James brothers encounter Charley and Robert Ford, both of whom Jesse eventually recruits into his dwindling gang. Bob Ford is portrayed as a fawning sycophant who is obsessed with Jesse's national celebrity and hopes to one day attain similar renown for himself. As Jesse faces increasing pressure from the authorities, he begins to suspect those around him of conspiring to betray him. Indeed, the Fords end up negotiating a deal with the governor of Missouri to capture or kill Jesse in exchange for the offered reward and exoneration for their previous crimes. Following Jesse's murder, the Fords receive the promised acquittal and a portion of the reward money, but find themselves almost unanimously detested and ostracized by the American public. The stories of their subsequent lives and deaths are recounted against the backdrop of their notoriety as America's most reprehensible blackguards. Reception In a 1983 book review, Kirkus Reviews remarked the book contained \\"well-written, artful descriptions. . . yet also drawing away to show us the frame like an announcer's binding narration\\" and noted that \\"only occasionally can [Hansen] get tension into this documentary approach; and the zooms between close-up and voice-over soon become predictable and sapping. Thoughtful, artful reconstruction‚Äîyet largely uninvolving.\\" The novel made the short list for the 1984 PEN/Faulkner Award.

The pact confirmed all basic provisions of the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920. The Soviet Union continued to recognize Vilnius and Vilnius Region to Lithuania, despite the fact that the territories were under Polish control since the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny in 1920. It also recognized Lithuania's interests in the Klaipƒóda Region. In exchange Lithuania agreed not to join any alliances directed against the Soviet Union, which meant international isolation at the time when Soviet Union was not a member of the League of Nations. Ratifications were exchanged in Kaunas on November 9, 1926, and the pact became effective on the same day. The pact was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on March 4, 1927.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 60, pp. 146-159. The pact was initiated by Lithuanians who sought a new direction in the foreign policy after the Locarno Treaties. The negotiations started on December 25, 1925 when People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin stopped in Kaunas on his way to Moscow. The negotiations were difficult as Latvia and Estonia disapproved the pact because it prevented creation of the Baltic Entente, Poland claimed that the agreement violated the Peace of Riga, and Germany was wary over strengthening Lithuanian claims to the Klaipƒóda Region. The pact was controversial in Lithuania and its ratification by the Third Seimas on 5 November 1926 caused student protests against \\"Bolshevization\\" of Lithuania. As one of the protests was dispersed by force, it is cited as one of the reasons for the military coup in December 1926. However, the diplomats believed that keeping the dispute over Vilnius Region relevant in the European politics was worth the cost. The original pact was set to expire in five years, but on 6 May 1931, it was extended for another five years.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 125, pp. 256-263.

It opened in 1834 and carried traffic until 1937. It was abandoned in 1952, along with most of the Rochdale Canal, and although the Rochdale Canal has been reopened, the junction lies under the embankments of the M62 motorway. History The Rochdale Canal was opened on 21 December 1804, having taken ten years to build, and provided a trans-Pennine link between Manchester, where it connected with the Bridgewater Canal and Sowerby Bridge, where it connected with the Calder and Hebble Navigation. The estimated cost of ¬£291,900 had overrun, with the final cost in the region of ¬£600,000. Nevertheless, trade flourished and between 1827 and 1829, the canal carried 498,402 tons per year, which generated tolls of ¬£36,794. With prospects good, the canal committee considered a branch to Heywood in August 1832, and then sought estimates of the cost of construction and the likely traffic. These were favourable, and the shareholders agreed to proceed at a meeting held on 3 August 1833. No Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise it, as they were able to buy all the land required without dispute. The branch was long, and was level. It terminated at a wharf in Heywood, where a warehouse had been built, and opened on 10 April 1834. The opening was performed by the committee, who travelled along the new canal in a boat called The Rochdale. When the Manchester to Littleborough Railway opened in July 1939, the company ran a packet boat for passengers from Bluepits Station, in Castleton, to Heywood Wharf. The service lasted until late 1840, as the railway company was building a branch line which included a station at Heywood close to the terminal wharf. It opened in April 1841. The branch was not used after 1937, and navigation rights on most of the Rochdale Canal, including the branch, were repealed by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1952. Route The canal left the main line of the Rochdale Canal at Maden Fold Junction, opposite Maden Fold Farm, which was on the east bank. The towpath was also on the east bank and a swing bridge a little to the north of the junction gave access to the west bank. There was another swing bridge over the entrance to the Heywood Branch, although the towpath was on its north bank. The branch headed towards the west in a straight line, passing through the embankment of the London Midland and Scottish Railway, just below the point where the Castleton South Fork turned off from the main line. The modern M62 motorway passes under the railway at the same point. The canal continued to the south of the motorway route, and then turned to the north west, to reach a bridge at Hope Street.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1929 and 2011 Ley farm was situated below the bridge on the west side. Hope Street gave access to the towpath, but did not continue any further once it had crossed the canal. To the north of the bridge, again on the west side, was Hope Mill. This is marked as a cotton mill in 1893 and 1929, but was disused in 1937 and had been demolished by 1956. High Street Cotton Mill was located on the same side in 1893, just before Canal Street bridge. It had become cabinet manufactory called Excelsior Works by 1910, and remained so in 1929, but like Hope Mill was disused in 1937 and demolished in 1956. Between Canal Street Bridge and Green Lane Bridge were Bridge Mill, a cotton mill from 1893 until 1929, and Park Street Mill, just called Cotton Mill in 1893, and again active in 1929. The site of both had been cleared by 1937, and turned into allotment gardens by 1956.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1893, 1910, 1929, 1937 and 1956 Opposite Park Street Mill, on the towpath side, was Sefton Mill, with the Phoenix Brewery behind it. The mill was called Globe Mill in 1893, and marked as a cotton mill subsequently. The mill was disused by 1937, and by 1956 had been demolished, by which time the brewery was disused. The final section of the canal between Green Lane Bridge and the terminal wharf had five cotton mills on the west side, and the Sun Iron Works on the east side. The mills were Albert Mill, Gregge Street Mill, Princess Mill, Victoria Mill and Twin Mill, and all were operational in 1893, 1910 and 1927. By 1937 the first two were disused, but in 1956 Albert Mill was manufacturing furniture while Gregge Street Mill had become a chemical works. The other three mills were still working in 1956, as was the Sun Iron Works. Near the end of the canal, on the north-west corner of the iron works, was a wider section of canal, to allow boats to turn, beyond which there was a crane on either side of the canal and a covered wharf building. A third crane is shown on the 1956 map. Current status A large portion of the canal survives although is dry along the whole route. The junction with the Rochdale canal has been lost with the building of the M62. The canal emerges and runs south of the motorway for roughly 500 meters before turning north where the motorway severs it. The canal then runs north of the motorway toward Hope Street. It passes through the site of Hope Street Bridge that has been demolished and filled in. The canal is infilled from this point and runs under a field until it reaches Canal Street. The bridge here has been demolished. The canal from here is lost beneath a small industrial estate although the route can be seen in maps. Green lane Bridge has been lost after the road was widened although the road was never lowered, leaving a hump in the road. The canal route is shown by a road between two buildings parallel to Sefton Street until it reaches the Wharf at Quay Street. The wharf can still be seen, although infilled and is used as a car park. The re-opened Rochdale Canal no longer passes through the site of the junction, as the cost of building a navigable culvert through the M62 embankment would have been prohibitive. Instead, the canal was routed through a farm access culvert, and a new access road was built to serve the farm. As the culvert was somewhat higher than required, lock 53 was moved from the north side of the motorway to the south side. Heywood railway station is now part of the preserved East Lancashire Railway, although it is situated slightly further to the east, nearer to the former wagon works, than it was when the canal was open.

Specializing in the still rings and pommel horse, he is a two-time Olympic Champion, two-time World Champion and seven-time USSR Champion. Shahinyan has awarded the honors Honoured Master of Sports of the USSR in 1952, Honored Coach of Armenia in 1961 and Honored Worker of Physical Culture and Sports of the Armenian SSR in 1966. From 1967 to 1969, he headed the Sports Committee of the Armenian SSR and from 1969 to 1975 he was the Deputy Chairman of the Sports Committee. Early life Hrant Shahinyan was born on July 30, 1923 in the village of Gyulagarak. His family moved to Yerevan in 1930. In 1943 at the age of 20, Shahinyan volunteered to fight in the front line in World War II and received a wounded leg during service. He had to walk with a stick afterward, but after undergoing treatment in 1946 and through much hard work, was able to become a member of the USSR Artistic Gymnastic National Team. Biography Hrant Shahinyan began studying gymnastics under Harutyun Gargaloyana after moving to Yerevan. In 1939, he became the undisputed champion of the USSR among juniors. As a member of the Soviet Union national team, Shahinyan competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Shahinyan had qualified for every event. The Soviet team won the Team All-Around gold medal. Afterwards Shahinyan competed in the Individual All-Around, where he won the silver medal, coming in second to Viktor Chukarin, who would not only prove to be Shahinyan's rival, but the most decorated Olympian of the 1952 Olympics. Shahinyan was unable to best Chukarin in the pommel horse either. He tied in second with stablemate Yevgeny Korolkov, resulting in two silver medalists. Shahinyan came in fourth place in the parallel bars. When it came time for the still rings, Shahinyan scored higher than Chukarin and the rest of the participants to win the gold medal of the event and became the Olympic Champion in rings.\\"1952 Summer Olympics - Helsinki, Finland - Gymnastics\\" databaseOlympics.com (Retrieved on April 4, 2008) Two years later at the 1954 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, Shahinyan became a World Champion in the pommel horse by winning the gold medal of the event and the Soviet team won the gold medal in the Team All- Around once again. Shahinyan also won a bronze medal in the Individual All- Around. In 1958, Shahinyan founded the Youth Gymnastic Olympic Sports School in the Armenian capital Yerevan, and became the director of the sports school. In 1975, Shahinyan arrived in Damascus to manage the Syrian gymnastics national team for almost 5 years until 1980. Later, he returned to Armenia and lived there until his death in 1996. Legacy Shahinyan, who won two gold medals and two silver medals in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, is the first Armenian in modern Olympic history to win an Olympic medal. To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics, Shahinyan was quoted as saying: in 2014, Shahinyan's statue was erected at the entrance of the Hrant Shahinyan gymnastics school of Yerevan.

It was in use from 1794, and was bordered by the landscaped gardens of Lark Mill House on the western bank until the 1850s. A number of industries grew up around the branch, ranging from cotton mills and an iron and brass foundry in the early years, to a bakery and jam manufactory, woolen mills and sawmills later on. The branch declined with the main canal, and was little used after the 1920s, although not officially abandoned until 1952. It was filled in during the 1960s, and the site of the main basins now lies beneath the car park of a retail shopping centre. History The Rochdale Canal was surveyed by John Rennie in June 1791, although he had no experience of building canals at the time. He was chosen because the engineers of choice, William Jessop and Robert Whitworth, did not have time for the project. In August 1791 Rennie was asked to conduct further surveys for a branch to Rochdale, another to Oldham and a third to some limeworks near Todmorden. The canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 4 April 1794, which created the Rochdale Canal Company and sanctioned the building of a canal across the Pennines from Sowerby Bridge, where it would join the Calder and Hebble Navigation, to Manchester, where it would connect to the Bridgewater Canal. Construction of the whole canal would take around 13 years, but sections were opened as and when they became useful, and the Rochdale Branch, which was about half a mile (0.8 km) long, was opened in 1798, from a basin at Richard Street to Halfpenny Bridge. Additional sections were opened in 1799, and the canal was formally opened in 1804, but there seems to be some doubt that it was all constructed, for two more acts of parliament were obtained in 1804 and 1806 to raise additional finance, and a final one in 1807 to tidy up some loose ends. Navigation on the main canal had all but ceased by 1927, and an act of parliament obtained in 1952 banned public navigation on most of the waterway. It lay dormant for 20 years, but between then and 2002 the waterway was steadily restored and reopened. In 2000, ownership of the canal transferred from the Rochdale Canal Company to British Waterways, but there are no plans to re-open the Rochdale Branch. The branch was filled in at the end of the 1960s, and a retail shopping centre now covers most of the line of the canal, with the former basin serving as the car park. Just a short section from the junction to Durham Street remains in water, and is used as a turning point. Industry The branch acted as a centre for industry. In 1851, Durham Street Bridge had yet to be built, but Crossfield Bridge crossed the canal just below the Bedford Street Mills arm. Nothing had been built to the west of the canal or on either side of Bedford Street Mills arm, but to the east of the canal, there were houses at the bottom, and above that, Oldham Road Mill, which was a cotton spinning mill and Soho Foundry, which was an iron and brass foundry.Ordnance Survey, 1:1056 map, 1851 By 1892, Collinge Street had been built, and Durham Street Bridge carried it over the canal. Cotton mills had been built on the west side of the junction with the Rochdale Canal, and Crossfield Bridge had been removed, as the rest of the west bank up to the arm was now occupied by Grove Cotton Mills. Oldham Road Mill had been replaced by a larger building housing Victoria Woolen Mill, and the iron and brass foundry had been split to become Soho Woollen Mill and Soho Iron Foundry.Ordnance Survey, 1:500 map, 1892 In 1910, the mills at the start of the branch can be identified as the Norwich Street Mills, and both of the Soho works have become the Soho Iron Works,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1910 which was still the case in 1930.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1930 By 1958, most of the buildings are just labelled \\"works\\", and so usage is not so obvious.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1958 On the west bank, most of the area between the Bedford Street Mills arm and the Halfpenny Bridge was occupied by Lark Mill House in 1851, with landscaped gardens running down to the edge of the canal, which was lined with trees. By 1892, Larkfield Cotton Mills had been built on the south side of the arm, and Lark Cotton Mills on the north-west corner. In 1910, the map shows that Bedford Street had been built, Lark Mills had become the Bridgewater Mill, and Lark Mill House had been replaced by rows of terraced housing. The north side of the arm was occupied by Windsor Mill in 1930, which was used for mill furnishing, and the end of the arm is covered, but it is not clear if this is an awning or a building. By 1958, Lark Mill had become the British Tours garage. On the east bank above the arm, the towpath in 1851 was flanked by Moss Hall Mill, a cotton spinning mill with a boilerhouse to the north, and Gibralter Cotton Mill. Both had become Moss Hall Cotton Mill by 1892, a bakery and jam manufactory by 1910, and warehousing by 1930. Beyond was Halfpenny Bridge, although not named as such in 1851, and the twin-tracked railway bridge. Sandwiched between them was Lark Corn Mill on the west bank and Oldham Road Cotton Mill to the east. By 1892, the cotton mill was disused, and the site of the corn mill had been cleared. Halfpenny Bridge is clearly labelled as such. It was a footbridge, and the steps leading up to it on the west bank, and another set leading down from the road to the towpath on the east bank can be clearly identified. The Grecian Emery Works had appeared on the east bank by 1910, and was still operating in 1930. =Basins= To the north of the railway were a short arm and two basins. The arm was a similar width to the canal, and was bordered by wharves, equipped with cranes. Next was a longer and somewhat wider basin, with bays on both sides near the end, where there was a warehouse on the east bank. Again there are cranes marked on the map, and Vicars Moss cotton spinning mills and Union Sawmills were located between the two basins in 1851. The final basin was much wider, and was flanked by warehouses to the east and across the north end. The western side was bordered by wharves, with canal warehouses beyond them, and a total of twelve cranes. Radcliffe Cotton Mill was located between the wharves and the railway bridge. By 1892, Radcliffe Mill had gone, to be replaced by a dry dock equipped with a travelling crane, and more wharves, with two travelling cranes. High Level Road had been built, and Union Sawmills had been replaced by a sawmill between the first arm and the bridge. Vicars Moss Mills were now a woollen mill. The sawmills had been replaced by wharves in 1910, and a timber yard occupied the east side of the middle basin. By 1930, Vicars Moss Mill was processing cotton waste, while most of the first arm had been filled in. Between its location and the bridge, a picture house and a billiard hall had been built. The dry dock was no more, and a masonic hall had been built on the wharf. The first arm was the site of a garage in 1958, and the picture house and billiard hall had been replaced by a works, but again its usage is unspecified.

She is noted for directing the 1960s Second Land Use Survey of Britain and for analyses of land use planning and urban design which have influenced the design of residential developments since the 1980s. Education After qualifying as a teacher Coleman studied for a BA at Birkbeck College and an MA from University College London.2008,COLEMAN, Prof. Alice Mary in Who's Who 2008, A&C; Black Academic career After working as a secondary school teacher Coleman became a lecturer at the geography department of King's College London, eventually becoming professor in 1987 after other posts in Canada and Japan. She retired in 1996 and is now emerita professor. =Land Use Survey= In the 1960s Coleman took on the role of director of the Second Land Use Survey of Britain. This was the first comprehensive attempt to map the use of land since Dudley Stamp's survey of the 1930s. Around 120 sheets each covering 200 km2 were published. =Land use planning= Coleman's findings on the Land Use Survey led to an attack on the effectiveness of the planning system within the UK, which she considered responsible for much degraded land in the rural/urban fringe (Coleman 1976). =Urban design= As head of the Land Use Research Unit at King's in the 1980s, Coleman built on the work of architect Oscar Newman on the concept of defensible space. The unit studied indications of 'social malaise' (litter, vandalism, graffiti etc.) on post-war social housing developments in the inner London boroughs of Southwark and Tower Hamlets (visiting all 4,050 multi- storey blocks in these boroughsTowers, G. (2000), Shelter is not enough: Transforming multi-storey housing ', pp114 et seq, The Policy Press, ), and the Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford. These measures were correlated with various design features such as number of storeys, number of flats in a block etc. The findings published as Utopia on trial (Coleman 1985) were controversial, with Newman suggesting that insufficient attention was paid to social factors interacting with the physical. Bill Hillier of the Bartlett School of Architecture argued that many of Coleman's findings on the link between large scale housing and social problems were a statistical artefact: simply put, large blocks have more litter than small because they are larger. Nevertheless, in 1991 the government provided ¬£50 million to test the ideas in selected estates under Coleman's direction under the DICE (Design Improvement Controlled Experiment) project (see Coleman 1992). A significant proposal was the removal of overhead walkways linking blocks to reduce opportunities for crime, though the overall effectiveness of DICE, and the general effectiveness of physical design methods over social and economic measures remains controversial. Other interests =Graphology= Coleman's interest in graphology has included editing and contributing to Graphology magazine and writing a graphological thesaurus. =Literacy= Coleman's most recent publication (Coleman & McKnee 2007) is on the teaching of reading in primary schools, promoting the use of phonics. As a teacher in secondary modern schools in the 1940s prior to her career at King's College London, Coleman claims to have encountered only one pupil in 1200 unable to read. By comparison today perhaps 30 of these would be in special schools for the learning disabled and a further 300 illiterate.

The abbey is famous for its spiritual life and its brewery, which is one of few Trappist beer breweries in the world. Life in the abbey is characterised by prayer, reading and manual work, the three basic elements of Trappist life. History =17th to 18th century= On 30 January 1648, at the end of the Eighty Years War, the Treaty of M√ºnster was signed between Spain and the Netherlands. The result of the treaty was that the Catholic mass was not allowed in the Dutch Republic. Therefore, Catholics from Valkenswaard and Schaft built a chapel in Achel which was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The early roots of the Abbey date back to 1686, when Petrus van Eynatten, a son of the mayor of Eindhoven, founded a community of hermits of Saint Joseph. The community would flourish until 1789 when they were expelled from their convent after the French revolutionary army invaded the Austrian Netherlands. The abbey was sold to Jan Diederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken (Utrecht, 6 August 1773-Heeze, 9 July 1843). =19th century= On 21 March 1846 the Trappists from Westmalle Abbey founded a priory in Achel (first founded in Meersel-Dreef on 3 May 1838 in a former monastery of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin). The abbey and its 95 hectares of land had been bought by the priest Gast from Heeze on 9 April 1845 with the support of several beneficiaries. The first beer to be brewed on the site was the \\"Patersvaatje\\" in 1852. In 1871, the priory was granted the status of abbey and beer brewing became a regular activity. By reclaiming wasteland, the agriculture and cattle-breeding of the abbey prospered. In addition several daughter-houses were founded in Echt (Lilbosch Abbey), Diepenveen, Rochefort (Rochefort Abbey) and the abbey of Notre Dame de l'Emmanuel in Kasanza in 1958 (Belgian Congo) =20th century= At the beginning of World War I (1914) the monks left the abbey. The Germans dismantled the brewery in 1917 to salvage the approximately 700 kg of copper. After World War II a new abbey was built between 1946 and 1952, but only two wings of the planned four were completed. In 1989 the abbey sold most of its land to the Dutch National Forest Administration and the Flemish Government. In 1998 with the support from the trappists from Westmalle and Rochefort brewing started again.  Monks  * Dom Franciscus Janssens, Ocist. 76th General Abbot of the Common Observance.

Pennsylvania is also known as the Keystone State, hence the name. The first KOZ's were established in 1999 by the Pennsylvania State Legislature and signed into law by Tom Ridge, who was then the Governor of Pennsylvania. As of 2008, KOZ's are still being supported by continuing acts of the state legislature and the former governor Ed Rendell. The zones are located throughout Pennsylvania in 12 separate regions: Northwest, Southwest, North Central, Southern Alleghenies, Northern Tier, Central, South Central, Lackawanna/Luzerne, Schuylkill/Carbon, Lehigh Valley, Southeast, and Philadelphia. Many of the sites are located in pre-existing airports and industrial parks. Rust Belt, highlighted in red Pennsylvania is part of the Rust Belt, a strip of states across the northeastern and midwestern parts of the United States. These states were formerly industrial powers, but many of their industries have since left, leaving behind vast expanses of factories, mills, and office buildings that have begun to decay or rust. Some of these areas in Pennsylvania have been named Keystone Opportunity Zones with the idea of re-establishing and creating industrial and commercial centers throughout the state. Other KOZ's include newly zoned industrial parks and new and old corporate office spaces. Examples of Pennsylvania KOZ's include the Mid-State Regional Airport in Centre County, and the Cira Centre, a 28-story office building in Philadelphia. Keystone Opportunity Zones are designated by local communities and approved by the state. Businesses or companies that are new to Pennsylvania must locate within one of the designated zones to receive tax benefits. Businesses and companies that are already well established in Pennsylvania may become obtain KOZ benefits by increasing full-time employment within one year after receiving KOZ status or by making capital investments equal to 10 percent of the previous years gross revenue. Olympus Corporation, a Japanese company specializing in optics and imaging, opened its American headquarters in a Keystone Opportunity Zone in Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County in 2006.

He received his BSc from Laval University in 1952 and his MSc from the University of Toronto in 1953. He began employment with the Meteorological Service of Canada as a weather forecaster, then in 1959 shifted his interest to research in atmospheric models for short and medium-range numerical weather prediction. For his PhD (awarded in 1965), Robert worked at McGill University on the spectral model using spectral harmonics for the representation of atmospheric fields in global climate and numerical weather prediction models. Between 1963 and 1970, Robert developed the semi-implicit time integration algorithm for an efficient integration of the primitive equations for numerical weather prediction and climate models. Several weather centres in the world adopted this algorithm for their models (Canada in 1974, Australia in 1976, ECMWF in 1977, USA in 1980). In 1980, Robert successfully combined his semi-implicit scheme with existing Lagrangian techniques which allows the use of much longer time steps and hence produces a very efficient integration of meteorological equations. Robert retired from the Canadian Meteorological Centre in Montreal in 1987 and took a Faculty position at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. There he worked with colleagues to develop a fully elastic atmospheric model that relaxed the hydrostatic approximation used by all large-scale climate and numerical weather prediction models, thus paving the way to a universal model formulation usable at all scales. The resulting model came to be known by the name of Mesoscale Compressible Community model (MC). Robert's career was devoted to developing and implementing numerical techniques to solve the interacting time-dependent partial differential equations governing the chronological development of atmospheric behavior in an efficient manner, while still retaining accuracy; in contrast to many scientists who were concerned only with precision.  International influence  During his career, Andr√© Robert held several positions in national and international organizations: * In 1968-69, he was a visiting professor at the American meteorologists training center in Washington, D.C. * From 1968 to 1972, he was a member of the meteorology and atmospheric sciences subcommittee on the National Research Council of Canada. * From 1970 to 1976, Dr. Robert was a member of the working group on numerical weather prediction of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and became its president in 1973. * From 1972 to 1976 he was editor of publications of the WMO in numerical weather prediction. * In 1972-1973, he was President of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. At the same time, he was president of the group for the organization of a WMO conference on the subgrid parameterization in Leningrad (USSR), and another on modeling in Tallahassee (Florida). * In 1974, he chaired the International Symposium on Spectral Methods in Numerical Weather Prediction in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1975, he was a member of the Canadian delegation to the Seventh World Meteorological Organization Congress. From 1980 to 1983, he was a member of the selection committee for fellowships in meteorology, astronomy and Aeronomy of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.  Awards  Dr. Robert received these Awards: * 1967 and 1971, President of the jury for the awards from the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanography Society. * 1968, made Fellow of the American Meteorological Society. * 1981, prize of the second half of the twentieth century bestowed by the American Meteorological Society. * 1982, made Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. * 1986, received the Patterson Medal from the Atmospheric Environment Service (former name of the Meteorological Service of Canada). * From 1987 to 1993, Emeritus researcher to the Atmospheric Environment Service.

Joye waited for several days in Wolsey's antechamber to be received by the Cardinal, and witnessed the interrogation of Bilney and Arthur, which made him realize that it was safer for him to flee to the Continent. =First exile in Antwerp= It is sometimes thought that he went first to Strasbourg,Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, & Allan G. CHESTER, George Joye (1495?‚Äì1553). A Chapter in the History of the English Bible and the English Reformation, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962, pp. 47‚Äì50. but in 1529 at the latest he must have moved to Antwerp, where many other English Protestants took refuge (e.g. William Tyndale, Thomas Hitton, Robert Barnes, William Roye, and Myles Coverdale). Like Coverdale, Joye was probably also employed in the printing business as proofreader, translator, and author of religious books. His first, now lost publication was a Primer, the first Protestant devotional book ever published in English.Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, The English Primers (1529‚Äì1545). Their Publication and Connection with the English Bible and the Reformation in England, Philadelphia (PA): University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953, p. 2. Based on contemporary accounts, it probably contained the translation of the seven penitential psalms, \\"\\" with the Commendations (Psalm 119).Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, The English Primers (1529‚Äì1545). Their Publication and Connection with the English Bible and the Reformation in England, Philadelphia (PA): University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953, pp. 1‚Äì10. The book was criticized by Thomas More for omitting the Litany of the Saints, the hymns and anthems to the Blessed Virgin, and the Dirge.Thomas More, ', sig. Bb2. After the publication of his Primer, containing perhaps as many as thirty psalms, Joye set out to translate the rest of the Book of Psalms, which appeared in 1530. Joye used Martin Bucer's recent Latin translation of the Hebrew text, which was published under the pseudonym Aretius Felinus. In the same year Joye produced a revised version of his earlier primer with the title '. In 1531, Joye's translation of the Book of Isaiah appeared, which seems to have been intended as a twin volume to Tyndale's translation of the Book of Jonah.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz, Guido Latr√© (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, , pp. 138‚Äì139. In 1531 Joye also published a defence countering the charges of heresy put against him by Ashwell in 1527. By 1532 he married.\\"George Iay the preste, yt is wedded now\\" (Thomas More, ', sig. Bb2r. (CWTM VIII, p. 11)). Butterworth and Chester suggest that Joye published the translations of the Book of Proverbs and of Ecclesiastes in 1533 in Antwerp, of which only later London reprints have survived.Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, & Allan G. CHESTER, George Joye (1495?‚Äì1553). A Chapter in the History of the English Bible and the English Reformation, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962, pp. 135‚Äì143. It is now also believed that Joye is the author of an anonymously published treatise entitled ', which was earlier attributed to Tyndale.Orlaith O'SULLIVAN, The Authorship of The Supper of the Lord, in Reformation 2 (1997), pp. 207‚Äì232. In this Joye described his position on the Eucharist, based on that of Zwingli. Joye's translation of the Book of Jeremiah, of Lamentations, and a new translation of the Psalter followed (this time from the Latin Psalter of Zwingli, whose Latin commentaries and translations had also served as source texts for Joye's translations of the other books of the Old Testament). All these translations were the first of these books ever printed in English. In 1534 Joye undertook the proofreading of Tyndale's New Testament edition that had been reprinted three times without any English-speaking corrector by the Flemish printing firm of the family Van Ruremund. Joye, however, not only corrected the typographical errors, but he also changed the term \\"\\" as found in Tyndale's text by expressions such as \\"\\" in some twenty occurrences of the word.Gergely Juh√°sz, \\"Some Neglected Aspects of the Debate between William Tyndale and George Joye (1534‚Äì1535)\\", in Reformation 14 (2009), pp. 1‚Äì47. Joye believed, as he later explained, that the original term in the Bible in those places did not refer to the bodily resurrection but to the intermediate state of the soul.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz, Guido Latr√© (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, , pp. 159‚Äì161. At the same time, Joye retained Tyndale's original formulation at the some 150 other occurrences of the word, where he agreed with Tyndale that the term did refer to the bodily resurrection.Gergely Juh√°sz, \\"Translating Resurrection. The Importance of the Sadducees' Belief in the Tyndale‚ÄìJoye Controversy\\", in Reimund Bieringer, Veronica Koperski & Bianca Lataire (eds.), Resurrection in the New Testament, FS Jan Lambrecht, (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 165), Leuven: University Press ‚Äì Peeters, 2002, pp. 107‚Äì121. Tyndale reacted by bringing out his own revised version of his New Testament in November 1534, in which he inserted a second foreword attacking Joye and his editorial work. Tyndale accused Joye of promoting the heresy of the denial of the bodily resurrection and causing divisions among Protestants. After an inconclusive attempt to reconcile the parties, Joye published an apology to refute Tyndale's accusations in February 1535. =Return to England, second exile in Antwerp and final years again in England= In April 1535, Tyndale was betrayed by Henry Phillips, who also wanted to have Joye and Robert Barnes arrested, but Joye escaped and returned to England through Calais. Apart from the publication (1535) of an English translation of a Latin pamphlet, published a year earlier in Antwerp, there is nothing known about his years in England. Around the same time when Coverdale sought refuge again on the Continent, Joye, too, fled to Antwerp. During his second exile, he published apologetic works on various subjects, among which is a defense of the clergy's right to marry, against Stephen Gardiner.Helen L. PARISH, Clerical Marriage and the English Reformation. Precedent Policy and Practice, (StAndrews), Aldershot, Burlington, Singapore and Sydney: Ashgate, 2000, p. 58. In several of his works, he emphasizes that Christ's true Church has always been persecuted. Joye, as many of his contemporaries, was convinced that they lived in apocalyptic times and that the Return of Christ was not far away. After Henry's death (1547), Joye returned to England. In May 1548, he published a translation of a book by Andreas Osiander about conjectures of the end of the world, in which he projected the end of the world between 1585 and 1625. In 1549, Joye debated the question of the preferred punishment of adulterers with John Foxe. In September 1549, Joye was given the Rectory of Blunham, Bedfordshire by Sir Henry Grey of Flitton, and in 1550 he was appointed Rector of Ashwell, Hertfordshire. George Joye died in 1553. Legacy Joye's translations of Psalms, Isaiah, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Jeremiah and Lamentations, were the first English publications of these books of the Bible ever printed. His translations of the Psalter and his primer were repeatedly republished, and influenced the Anglican Book of Common Prayer and private Protestant devotion. His Biblical translations were used by Myles Coverdale (for the Coverdale Bible), and by others. Some of Joye's wordings were kept or reintroduced in later versions (e.g. \\"sauing helthe\\" (Psalms 67:2), \\"backslide\\" (Jeremiah 3:6,12,14,22), \\"a mess of pottage\\" (Proverbs 15:17), or the proverb \\"\\" (Proverbs 16:18). It was also Joye's translation of Psalms 91:5 in his first Psalter (\\"\\", where \\"\\" refers to bogies or evils spirits), which was copied by Coverdale (1535) and by John Rogers in the Matthew Bible (1537), and which was retained even in the Great Bible (1539). Based on this expression these Bibles are sometimes called the \\"Bugge Bibles.\\".Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, & Allan G. CHESTER, George Joye (1495?‚Äì1553).

It is based on the life and career of actress and comedian Lucille Ball. Plot In 1960, moments before filming the final episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz send scathing messages to each other through a pageboy. Co-stars Vivian Vance and William Frawley comment on the tense situation, but everyone puts on their best front as Desi introduces them for the final time and Lucy emerges to a warm welcome from the studio audience. The scene then changes to 1925, when a young Lucille is living with her family in Celoron, New York. Her desire to be a performer prompts her to enroll in an acting school, where encounters with a condescending Bette Davis and an unreceptive acting coach result in her quitting. Shortly after, Lucy's grandfather is sued by the family of a neighborhood boy who was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone target shooting under his supervision. Left penniless by the lawsuit, Lucy and her family move into an apartment in Jamestown. She finds work as a model and a cigarette girl in New York City before landing a job as a Goldwyn Girl and eventually moving to Hollywood to pursue a film career. After earning several minor roles as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures, she befriends Carole Lombard, convinces the rest of her family to move to California, hires an African-American maid named Harriet and develops a romantic relationship with fellow contract player Desi Arnaz before eloping with him in November 1940. Lucy later signs with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and stars alongside comedian Red Skelton in DuBarry Was a Lady. Meanwhile, rumors of Desi being unfaithful puts a strain on their marriage, which is further strained following a devastating miscarriage. After being released from MGM, Lucy meets silent movie legend Buster Keaton, who is convinced of her talent as a clown and takes her under his wing. Her comedic skills further gestate on the radio program My Favorite Husband, which leaves her more convinced of her comedic abilities. Gathering the radio team together, the idea for I Love Lucy is formed and pitched to CBS. When studio executives prove to be skeptical of the public's readiness, Lucy sets out to prove them wrong by performing several comedy routines. The network gives in but remains convinced that the show will flop. It proves to be a huge success, remaining a fan favorite for six years and forever changing the shape of television. By 1958, Desilu Productions is expanding as a television empire and the couple is being hailed as pioneers. Lucy's relationship with Desi continues to deteriorate, however, as his alcoholism and her commitment to her craft make it difficult for them to work together. The two decide it would be best if they end their marriage. In the present day, moments after the filming ends, Lucy and Desi hold hands as they leave the studio, content with remaining friends and proud of what they have accomplished.

Arnaz would eventually return to Desilu to attempt starting direction on a purchased property entitled Without Consent before moving on to NBC to oversee directing the TV sitcom The Mothers-In-Law. In the years following their divorce, he reconciled with Ball; the two were once again very close friends in their later years.

Built in 1887 and named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, it was declared to be a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1974 in recognition of the college's role as the first school of higher education in the nation established to provide a racially integrated educational environment. with Description and history Lincoln Hall is centrally located on the campus of Berea College, just northwest of the junction of Chestnut and Prospect Street, on the south side of the campus's central quadrangle. It is a three story brick building, covered by a hip roof and exhibiting modest Romanesque architectural features. It was built in 1887, originally with first floor for classrooms and offices, with second floor for classrooms and a library, and with third floor for laboratories, a museum and meeting rooms. It was funded by donation from Roswell C. Smith, founder of Century Magazine. As the college grew, uses of the hall changed. By 1974, the building was used for the President's office and other administrative functions, a role it continues to play today. Berea College was founded in 1855 by John Gregg Fee, but was closed during the American Civil War due to threatened violence against its principles of racial integration. It is significant as the first college established in the United States expressly for the goal of educating black and white students together, a principle it upheld until the early 20th century. In 1904, the state passed a law forcing Berea to segregate, resulting in the landmark Berea College v. Kentucky case in which the law was upheld.

He was the son of Jacob Ricardo and nephew of the economist David Ricardo. In 1841 he married Catherine Duff (c.1820 ‚Äì 1869), the daughter of General Sir Alexander Duff and sister of James Duff, 5th Earl Fife. They had one son, Alexander Louis (1843‚Äì1871), the first husband of Florence Bravo. In 1841 he was elected Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent as a Liberal, serving until his death. He was active in the repeal of the Navigation Acts in 1849. Businessman Ricardo was Chairman of the North Staffordshire Railway from 1846 until his death. In 1846, he and William Fothergill Cooke founded the Electric Telegraph Company, the world's first public telegraph company, and served as chairman until its merger with the International Telegraph Company in 1856. He was also a director of London and Westminster Bank. Ricardo was a leader of a group of businessmen who, in 1845, purchased the patents for the electric telegraph designed by Cooke and Wheatstone. Ricardo was Electric Telegraph's largest shareholder, and its executive chairman, for its first 12 years. His goal was to build a network that would distribute breaking financial news to his own newsrooms adjacent to all British stock exchanges‚Äîan information monopoly that would be valuable to speculators and investors. However, when the established telegraph companies formed monopolistic cartels and raised prices to newspapers, Ricardo secretly switched sides and campaigned for their nationalization.Roger Neil Barton, \\"The birth of telegraphic news in Britain,\\" Media History (2010) 16#4, pp 379-406 Publications * The anatomy of the Navigation Acts, Charles Gilpin, London (1847) References Further reading * Barton, Roger Neil. \\"The birth of telegraphic news in Britain,\\" Media History (2010) 16#4, pp 379‚Äì406 * Fetter, Frank Whitson. \\"The Influence of Economists in Parliament on British Legislation from Ricardo to John Stuart Mill\\", The Journal of Political Economy, 83 no.5 (1975) 1051‚Äì1064. * Mather, Francis C. \\"The railways, the electric telegraph and public order during the Chartist period, 1837‚Äì48.\\" History 38.132 (1953): 40‚Äì53. * Obituary, The Gentleman's Magazine (Oct. 1862) p. 496‚Äì97.

In larger companies, the tools stored there must be checked in and out, and there may be a person assigned to attend the area. In a factory, the toolroom refers to a space where artifacts are made and repaired, particularly tools for use throughout the rest of the factory, jigs for setups, and other parts to assist workers and, as an extension, production. In engineering and manufacturing, toolroom activity is everything related to tool-and-die facilities in contrast to production line activity. Originally a toolroom was literally in one room, but like emergency room, the term has been figuratively extended in both substantive and adjectival senses to all such places and the methods used there, regardless of the physical space. The name was originally styled tool room or tool-room, but toolroom is now the norm in engineering and machining.  Making, repairing, and storing tools  The simplest sense of the word toolroom refers to the storage of tools. A broader use of the term includes reference to a space where tools are made, repaired, inventoried, and/or distributed for use within the factory. This extension of the latter sense reflects the development of greater systemization in manufacturing. During the 19th century, there gradually developed a division of labor whereby the people who made, repaired, kept records of, stored, and retrieved tools were not necessarily the same people who used the tools to do the manufacturing work itself. Examples of such division of labor had existed in prior centuries, but most manufacturing had been done on a craft basis, where there had been no need for the idea of a toolroom separate from the rest of the workshop. The simplest sense above can also be conveyed by the word toolcrib (sometimes styled tool-crib or tool crib).  Tool-and-die facilities and methods  In engineering and manufacturing, a toolroom is everything related to tool-and- die facilities and methods, in contrast to the factory floor and production line activity. For people not familiar with these fields, in order to understand the specialist usage, some explanation is needed: Within the general field of machining there is a rough but recurring division between (a) toolroom practice and (b) production practice (the making of large numbers of duplicate parts). It is the difference between manufacturing itself and the tool-and-die work that is done in support of the manufacturing. Anecdotal examples of similar distinctions can probably be found here and there throughout human history, but as a widespread part of the \\"fabric\\" of material culture, this distinction (and the terminology with which to talk about it) has evolved since the Industrial Revolution, and most especially since the advent of armory practice and later mass production. A good, simplistic way to summarize the change in ideas is to compare the making of a certain product in different time periods. In 1750, a rifle was made in a workshop by a craftsman using hand tools, and if he needed a new tool, it is likely that he would make it himself using the same tools and methods that he would use to make his product, the rifle (smithy, files, woodcarving knives, etc.) This type of craftsmanship can still be done today, but it is expensive in terms of skilled labor time per unit of output, and therefore it implies small total output volume and high unit price. However, today the way to make rifles in large quantity with low unit price is to first do the tool-and-die work (toolroom work) (that is, make, or have someone else make, machine tools, jigs, and fixtures), and then use those specialized tools to mass-produce the rifles in an automated way that involves no toolroom methods. Another example, instead of comparing different centuries, simply compares different methods of toolpath control that could be chosen today: If you need a certain hole location on each part for your drill bit, will you dial it carefully by hand many times (once for each part produced), or will you dial it carefully by hand only once‚Äîwhile making a drill jig for subsequent drilling to be quickly and effortlessly guided by? The manufacturing of small batches has often presented the biggest challenge to this division of methods. When only a small batch of output is demanded, will one (a) produce each piece using \\"custom\\" methods (handcrafting or toolroom-style layout and machining), which drives up unit cost; or (b) maintain the capital-cost-intensive toolroom-production division, which also drives up unit costs in its own ways? In other words, is it worth one's time to make a fixture, and is it worth tying up a drill press's availability by setting it up for dedicated use with that fixture? The drill press may be needed tomorrow for a different part, with a different setup. For 100 parts, the costs of making a fixture and tying up a machine's availability are justified. For 5 parts, maybe one should just make each of the 5 using toolroom-style layout and toolpath control. The evolution of IT and its integration into manufacturing is changing the questions and equations still further. For example, CNC and robotics have led the way to rapid prototyping and instant manufacturing, which shift the toolroom-production division by giving an up-front toolroom investment the flexibility to be quickly and easily used for any product design, with batch size irrelevant. In large corporations there may be a very distinct division of labor between toolroom work and production machining, with different employees for each, whereas job-shop work is often a blend of toolroom work and production work, because each project requires some of both, and the same employees may \\"wear each hat\\" in sequence.

Plot The movie centers on Carlton Garrett (Justin Timberlake), the adult son of baseball legend Kyle Garrett (Jeff Bridges) and a minor-league baseball player with the Corpus Christi, Texas Hooks. One night, after another game in which he continues to slump at the plate, Carlton gets a phone call from his grandfather Amon (Harry Dean Stanton), who tells him that Carlton's mother, Katherine (Mary Steenburgen) has fallen ill and is at the hospital. Katherine requires a surgery that the doctors recommend; however she refuses to sign the waiver until Kyle comes to visit her. After Carlton agrees to find his estranged father, together with his ex-girlfriend Lucy (Kate Mara), the two of them fly to Columbus, Ohio to break the news to Kyle, who is there for an autograph signing and doesn't have a cell phone. After a tense meeting, in which it's revealed that Carlton and Kyle haven't seen or spoken to each other in five years, Kyle agrees to fly to Texas to see Katherine with his son and Lucy. The next morning, while preparing to get through airport security, Kyle realizes that he's lost his wallet and hence his identification, therefore he's not allowed to board the flight. Lucy suggests that the three of them rent a car and drive. While at a gas station one evening, Kyle asks Lucy to bring him his bag which contain painkillers for his various aches. Lucy notices Kyle's wallet in the bag, revealing that Kyle intentionally misplaced his wallet in hopes of not having to get on the plane and thus not make the trip; Lucy keeps this discovery a secret from Carlton. As the trip progresses, Carlton and Kyle attempt to piece-together their fragile relationship. Also, Lucy tells Carlton that she's engaged to a new man; this creates a tension between the two, as their love towards each other remains. Many delays occur, as Kyle becomes increasingly anxious about seeing Katherine and becomes more and more unreliable. He seems to make up for this, however, when he tells Carlton and Lucy that he knows someone who works at the Memphis airport who can get him through security without I.D. While waiting for their flight, Kyle tells Carlton that the employee he knows doesn't exist and it was a cover-up story. Carlton realizes that Kyle has had his wallet the entire time and has purposely been delaying the trip. He angrily storms off to talk to Lucy, leaving Kyle unattended. After an argument with Lucy, whom he finds out knew about the wallet the whole time, he returns to where Kyle was sitting to find him missing. Carlton and Lucy get on the flight anyway and Carlton exits the flight to look for his father but not before telling Lucy that if he doesn't come back before takeoff, to get off the plane. Mad at Carlton and their argument, Lucy decides to stay on the plane anyway and she flies home; Carlton is also unsuccessful in finding Kyle. Carlton calls Katherine and she tells him that if his father is anywhere in Memphis, he'd be at The Peabody Hotel downtown. When Carlton arrives at the hotel he finds out from the front desk that no one by the name of Kyle Garrett has checked-in. Tired at this point, Carlton takes a room for the night. Later that evening, during a conversation with the Peabody Hotel bartender (Lyle Lovett), the bartender tells him that Kyle Garrett is indeed staying in the hotel but under an alias. Furious, Carlton confronts Kyle in Kyle's room. After forcing himself in, Carlton and Kyle wrestle each other to the ground, where Kyle tells Carlton that he loves Katherine but loves himself even more. Soon Kyle agrees to continue with the trip. The next day Carlton gets a phone call: Katherine has gotten an infection and the doctors have been forced to operate earlier than expected. Carlton, Kyle, Amon and Carlton's grandmother Virge (Lenore Banks) wait anxiously in the hospital waiting room. Soon Lucy shows up and she and Carlton reconcile. The doctor comes out and tells the family that the operation was a success. The next morning, while still at the hospital, Carlton tells Lucy that he's quitting baseball to focus on becoming a writer and Lucy tells Carlton that she's not a 'fiancee' anymore. At this point it's assumed that the two have gotten back together. Carlton drives Kyle to the airport, where Kyle agrees to come visit on New Year's and Carlton agrees to visit Kyle for Christmas. The ending scene shows Carlton clearing out his baseball locker and walking to his Jeep, where Lucy is waiting for him. The two drive off together.

All of the district's sites are shell middens along the banks of the Green River that date from the later portion of the Archaic period. Studies of this assemblage of sites were critical in the development of knowledge of the Archaic period in the eastern United States. Kentucky's Green River runs through a broad alluvial plain, from which outcroppings of bedrock project. The plain is an area that was inundated during the Pleistocene by a water body dubbed Lake Green, which resulted in the deposition of large amounts of silt. The middens of this district are typically located along the prehistoric routes of waterways that were established after Lake Green was drained. Archaic period Native Americans were drawn to these waterways by an abundance of mussels. The district was established and named a National Historic Landmark on May 5, 1994. Each of the district's twenty-three contributing properties had previously been listed on the National Register of Historic Places by itself.

It is situated in the southwest of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and forms the natural southern conclusion of the Lower Rhenish lowlands and the transition to the Rhenish Massif (Rheinische Schiefergebirge or \\"Rhenish Slate Mountains\\"). The Cologne Bight is surrounded by the High Fens and the Eifel to the west of the Rhine and by the uplands of Bergisches Land to the east of the Rhine. In the south and southeast the rising Rhine Massif, visible from far off by the silhouette of the Siebengebirge, surround the head of the bight at K√∂nigswinter. To the northwest the Cologne Bight opens out into the valleys of the Rhine and the Meuse, in the northeast it is bounded by the M√ºnsterl√§nder Kreidebecken (M√ºnster Chalk Basin) of the Westphalian Bight. Climate and geology Asparagus field near Sechtem The Cologne Lowland is among the warmest regions in Germany. While the summers on the upper Rhine are somewhat warmer, winters in the area are so mild that snow remaining on the ground for as much as several days would have been considered rather exceptional in the decades before the onset of the current climatic change. Due to the orographic rainfall on the surrounding mountain ranges the climate is relatively damp as well. In combination with the valuable loess soil, these factors make the Cologne Bight one of the most fertile regions of Germany. About 30 million years ago, parts of the Rhine Massif sank and formed a lowland region. Due to the subtropical climate at that time, there was a luxuriant plant growth of abundant varieties. About 15 million years ago, these plants died out and formed a peat layer up to 270 metres thick. From the pressure of earth layers lying over it, the peat was compressed into lignite (brown coal). The predecessor rivers of today's Rhine dug a broad river bed through the rock. These Rhine forerunners brought debris from the Alps, the Eifel, the Hunsr√ºck, and the Westerwald. Where the water flowed slowly (in the shallow water zones), clay was left behind; where it flowed fast, sand and gravel settled. The shores of the North Sea in those days occasionally reached up to where the cities of Aachen, Erkelenz, and M√∂nchengladbach are today. The Cologne Lowland is also seismically active today. The region is characterised by its agriculture (with orchards and truck farms), by open-pit lignite mining, by the landscapes of the Voreifel and the Bergisches Land as well as by 325 fortresses and castles, which were usually built as water castles.

After being captured and tortured during the persecution of Aurelian he was taken to the local arena in Palestrina and thrown to the wild beasts. However, the beasts refused to touch him and he was then beheaded.  Veneration  Saint Agapitus is mentioned in the ancient martyrologies, including the Martyrologium Hieronymianum of Saint Jerome, the Fulda Martyrology. Based on doubts regarding the details of his martyrdom, some of which were related in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology, editions from the end of the 20th century onward give only: \\"In Palestrina, Lazio, Saint Agapitus, martyr.\\"Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ), p. 437 Around the 5th century, Pope Felix III built a basilica in his honour on the supposed site of his martyrdom.Dom Gaspar LeFebvre, O.S.B., Saint Andrew Daily Missal, with Vespers for Sundays and Feasts, St Paul, MN: E. M. Lohmann Co., 1952, p. 1516 His relics were kept in the basilica, and a cemetery grew around it. At some uncertain date, his relics were transferred to the present cathedral of Palestrina. Some of them were transferred to Besan√ßon. Saint Agapitus is honoured in the Tridentine Calendar by a commemoration added to the Mass and canonical hours in the liturgy of the day within the Octave of the Assumption. Pope Pius XII abolished all octaves apart from those of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, including that of the Assumption. Accordingly, in the General Roman Calendar of 1960 the celebration of Saint Agapitus appears as a commemoration in the ordinary weekday Mass.Saint Andrew Daily Missal, with Vespers for Sundays and Feasts, p. 1516Rev.

It was the sixth ground at which the club had played. Also called Ashville Ground, it was located between Newcastle Road, Eglinton Street North and Crozier Street. Sunderland AFC's first game at the ground was a friendly against Birtley on 10 April 1886. The game ended as a 3 ‚Äì 3 draw. On 5 May 1888, the now-defunct Sunderland Albion F.C. played their inaugural game at Newcastle Road; a 3 ‚Äì 0 victory over Shankhouse Blackwatch, although Albion would go on to play their home games at Sunderland AFCs previous ground of Blue House Field. Sunderland AFC became the main tenants of Newcastle Road, initially playing a mixture of friendlies and Durham Challenge Cup games. On 30 October 1886, Newcastle Road hosted Sunderland's first ever home tie in the FA Cup; a 2 ‚Äì 1 victory over Newcastle West End F.C. Landowners, the Shipyard owning Thompson Sisters, charged the club ¬£15 rent in the first year, and labourers from the Thompson yards were enlisted to help build the stands. Sunderland joined the Football League in 1890, their first home league game being a defeat against Burnley on 13 September of that year. Six months later, in March 1891, the first England International to be held in Sunderland was played at Newcastle Road, as 15,000 spectators watched England beat Wales 4‚Äì1. In their first season in the Football League, Sunderland drew an average home attendance of 6,091 at Newcastle Road. The ground had an estimated capacity of 15,000, but frequently admitted many more, including a then English record football attendance of 21,000 for an 1891 FA Cup tie vs Everton F.C.. Over the course of the next decade, the club averaged crowds of 7,450 at Newcastle Road, peaking at 11,033 for their final season. Sunderland were hugely successful during their time at Newcastle Road, winning the league championship three times and embarking on a home run that saw them undefeated in 81 games and scoring 270 goals in the process. The success led them to be dubbed \\"The Team of All Talents\\", and Sunderland went on to be the first English side to be crowned World Champions By 1896, rent on the ground had risen to ¬£100, and space for expansion at Newcastle Road was limited. Recognising the need for growth, the board set about finding a new home. Sunderland became a Limited liability company, raised financing through the sale of shares, and purchased farmland in Roker for a new stadium. The final league game at the Newcastle Road was a 4‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest F.C. on 23 April 1898 and in the summer of 1898, Sunderland moved to Roker Park, where they would remain for 99 years. The ground features in a painting by the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy, a brother of Charles Napier Hemy. The image depicts a game between Sunderland and Aston Villa F.C. in 1895, and is believed to be the oldest painting of a league football game. The painting was later placed in the reception area at the Stadium of Light, the current home of the club.

Much of the modern architecture in the borough is centred on the commercial centre of the town, with much of the Victorian designs spread out on both the northern and southern corridors of the borough. Many former warehouses and factories have been converted for other uses changing the external appearance of Croydon erratically. Croydon also has a number of high rise buildings. Most were built during the sixties and seventies. However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in constructing tall buildings in Croydon. Numerous residential and office blocks are being built or have recently been built in the town centre. Saffron Square, a residential building completed in 2016, overtook Altitude 25 as Croydon's tallest tower. A taller building, Croydon Vocational Tower, was scheduled to finish construction in 2010 near East Croydon station. , however, construction had not taken place. , there are several upcoming architectural projects in the centre of the borough in the form of the Croydon Gateway scheme and the Cherry Orchard Road Towers.

An example of Croydon's newer low-rise buildings. Centrale shopping centre, managed by St Martins Property Group was completed in 2004 and includes a House of Fraser store Under the Labour run council since 1990, Croydon has witnessed a new period of construction. Prompted by the regeneration of the centre of Croydon. It features mainly office buildings designed by separate architects. Many of the new buildings in the past couple of years have been mainly low-rise. The Beddington Zero Energy Development in Beddington was designed by Bill Dunster. The project was conducted as a partnership between the BioRegional Development Group, the Peabody Trust, Bill Dunster Architects, Arup, and Gardiner and Theobald as cost consultants. The project is designed to use only energy from renewable sources generated on site. In addition to 777m¬≤ of solar panels, tree waste fuels the development's cogeneration plant (downdraft gasifier) to provide district heating and electricity. Other large-scale projects include the major Centrale shopping centre development by The Birmingham Alliance, which replaced the former C&A; store and the 1980s Drummond Centre which had fallen out of favour with the public. The new shopping centre was completed in 2004 and is managed by St Martins Property Group. The building has been designed to maximise the view of West Croydon from the eastern windows including the IKEA Towers landmarks on Purley Way. The building also has solar panels on the roof. The shopping centre features the high-end retailer House of Fraser which takes up most of the southern side of the centre. In Croydon, the College Green area has seen the construction of a new building for the Croydon Sixth Form College, Croydon Skills and Enterprise College and the Croydon Higher Education College. Many large scale projects are proposed as part of the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan. One of the most recent buildings to be constructed and opened within the northern half of the borough is Penoyre & Prasad's ¬£25m Ashburton Learning Village at Woodside which was partially opened in September 2006. The flagship building is home to Ashburton Community School, the Croydon Music Service, Ashburton Library and the Continuing Education and Training Service (CETS). Special features of the complex praised by energy minister Malcolm Wicks, include the building having the largest solar panels to be installed in any building inside the United Kingdom. The former Formula One world champion, John Surtees who was a former student of the school joined architect Greg Penoyre, who designed the flagship building and the Mayor of Croydon at an open day to officially launch the complex. Another recently built building is East Croydon station, one of the busiest in Greater London. The present East Croydon station building was opened on 19 August 1992. It consists of a large steel and glass frame suspended from a lightweight steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much greater extent than was possible with its Victorian predecessor. Four steel ladder masts anchor the glass box and the whole gives the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance. External canopies cover the entrances, a cafes open-air seating area and the approaches to the tram station. 440 m¬≤ of glass were used in the roof and 800 m¬≤ for the wall glazing. The architects were Alan Brookes Associates, who also made the close by NLA Tower, and the structural engineers YRM Anthony Hunt Associates. Being a key destination in the south for entertainment, Croydon recently opened the Croydon Grants. The Grants, towering over Surrey Street Market and in the shadow of the Croydon Clocktower. Inside the main attraction is a 10-screen Vue cinema, which was formerly a Warner Village. Although there are many other attractions, including a Reflex 80's Bar, Virgin Active, Nandos, Tiger Tiger and Lloyds No.1 Bar. The building is situated on five floors, with the top two being used by the cinema.  Future developments  Further new projects are planned for the city under the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan. Croydon's ambition to become \\"London's Third City\\" is a result of increased investment in the town and has led to some of South London's most ambitious non-residential schemes in the past ten years. Plans include the construction of a new shopping centre to replace St George's Walk and older properties on George Street. The proposed redevelopment of Park Place by Minerva and Lend Lease will create a one million square foot destination with over 130 shops, cafes and restaurants, anchored by a new department store which the council hopes will be John Lewis. Other tennents interested include Habitat, Borders and Gap. Improvements will see Queen's Gardens completely remodelled, together with the construction of a fully integrated public transport hub to include a new bus interchange and tram stop. The building of Park Place will create Europe's largest covered retail area. Croydon Gateway is the latest focus of major developments in the centre of Croydon following the demolition of various buildings there, including Wettern House. The Gateway site, a former railway goods yard which has been largely unoccupied since the 1960s, represents the largest single development opportunity in the district. Although there has been considerable interest in the site since the late 1980s by Stanhope, another party has also been interested in the site. Arrowcroft, which has received backing from both the former Labour and the current Conservative administration, has made the development of any project halted repeatedly. The problem is that Stanhope already owns part of the site, and without them selling it to Arrowcroft or Arrowcroft losing interest in the site no building work can commence. The Secretary of State will announce which plan will be granted the compulsory purchase order in mid 2008 after the public inquiry. The proposed scheme from Stanhope called Ruskin Square, named after John Ruskin, incorporates four blocks of office accommodation totalling 99,174 m¬≤, a health and fitness centre, a replacement Warehouse Theatre, an urban park and 560 residential units, with 50% affordable housing on a 3.4 hectare site bounded by George Street, Dingwall Road and Lansdowne Road. There would be a 41-storey skyscraper which is intended to act as the defining feature of Croydon's planned revival. Occupiers of the retail and restaurant units could include names like Carluccio's, Strada, Caf√© Rouge, Giraffe, Las Iguanas, Wagamama, Ciao Baby, Pizza Express, Loch Fyne and All Bar One. Norman Foster's firm are the principal architects of the scheme. The other scheme that carries the original name has backing from the local council. The plan incorporates a state-of-the-art 12,500 seat arena designed to attract world- class performers and international sporting events. Business conferences and dinners could also be held there, and community activities encouraged through the development of a bespoke community plan. In addition to the arena, the proposals include a mix of shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and a new 9,425 sqm food store. . of offices, 874 new homes, both affordable and private with a landmark tower, a health and fitness centre and a community health centre, a pedestrian plaza and a replacement Warehouse theatre. The result from the High Court is expected in June 2008. On the site of the Fairfield Building of Croydon College, a mixed-use development named the Croydon Vocational Tower has begun construction. The architecture and design of the building has similarities with the Trump International Hotel and Tower currently under construction in Chicago. If the building is finished before the Croydon Gateway Landmark Tower, it will officially become Croydon's tallest tower and one of London's tallest 20 buildings. Planning permission was approved by Croydon Council in February 2007, but building work has been slow ever since. It will be used for both educational purposes on the lower 10 floors by the college and private use as a residential tower on the rest of the 29 floors. There will also be a floor of leisure use which will be used by students of the college and residents of the tower. The building, once finished, will have a structural height of 134 m (439 ft) with the tower measuring 119.8 m in height to the top of the lift motor room, with an architectural spire protruding above this to a height of 133.8 m. Altitude 25 while under construction in early 2008. When finished it is set to become Croydon's tallest building. Highrise structures are being proposed in large numbers. In recent years, the development of tall buildings has been encouraged in the London Plan, which will lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom. Construction of the Altitude 25 residential skyscraper, at a cost of ‚Ç¨85m (¬£57m), began in 2006 and is due to be completed in 2008. The development is intended to regenerate a brownfield site three minutes' walk from East Croydon station.Facts of the Altitude 25 project published by Emporis, 2007. The Croydon Expo took place during May 2007, around the borough of Croydon. The main display of the future of the town centre can still be seen in the Central Library. The expo was a chance for residents and businesses to see what the future of Croydon would hold in the next decade. There have also been exhibitions for districts of Croydon, including Waddon, South Norwood and Woodside, Purley, New Addington, and Coulsdon. The main point of Croydon Exp07 was to showcase the projects included in the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration plan to the public. One of these projects included in the Expo was the Cultural Quarter. This project, devised by Howard Holdings, will include Croydon Parish Church, Bridgehouse, and The Exchange. It will include a new piazza, shops, and a theatre right in the centre of the Old Town. The Cultural Quarter will be situated between Surrey Street and Church Road, the oldest surviving part of Central Croydon. It is all projected to cost around ‚Ç¨29m, and is due to be completed by 2009 as it is already under construction. The new urban space will regenerate a Grade II listed former pumping station and a historic market. The adjacent bridge house will provides 74 affordable apartments and sits above a ground and mezzanine retail space. A new bridge links this building with the area's principal shopping street. The block wraps around an existing multi-storey car park, creating a back-drop to the open public space. New voids are opened up under the car park, making space for shops and caf√©s to open out onto the square. Opposite sits a former telephone exchange that is converted into a further 66 apartments. A mixture of green and brown roofs along with off-site renewable energy provision form part of the environmental measures incorporated into the regeneration. Located in the Cultural Quarter, the 150-year-old, castle-style pumping station is an established local icon and an attractive visual feature of the history of Croydon. The council believes the building could become an ideal base for creative businesses such as advertising, architecture, the art and antiques market, crafts, design, designer fashion, film and video, interactive leisure software, music, the performing arts, publishing, software and computer games, television and radio. These would contribute to the culture of the area. The owner, who already has planning permission for gym and leisure facilities, has expressed a willingness to work with the council to find other appropriate uses. Atkins, Walters & Webster (AWW Ltd) was selected as the architects to redesign the Bridge House and Exchange developments.

A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age, composition (or metallicity) and motion through space. Hence they most likely formed in the same location. This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group. The average space velocity of this group has components of U = ‚àí8, V = ‚àí27 and W = ‚àí14 km/s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across. The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties, as well as detection of companions through direct imaging. These can be used for refinement of young stellar models, for example. Age The age of the AB Dor Moving Group has been somewhat controversial, with quoted ages in the range of ~50 to ~150 Myr; recent work, however, seems to have converged on an age similar to that of the Pleiades (130 ¬± 20 Myr). Zuckerman & Song (2004) estimated an age of ~50 Myr for the AB Dor Moving Group, however this was only via comparison of age indicators to a single other group (the ~30 Myr-old Tucana group, which itself has a poorly determined age). Luhman, Stauffer, & Mamajek (2005) demonstrated that the AB Dor Moving Group and Pleiades open cluster have a similar pattern of Lithium depletion and color-magnitude diagram positions amongst their low-mass members, suggesting that the two groups were of similar age (~100-125 Myr). They also proposed that the similarity in space motions between the AB Dor group and Pleiades (within 2 km/s) hinted that the AB Dor group may have formed in the same star-forming complex that spawned the Pleiades cluster. Ortega et al. (2007) integrated the past Galactic orbits of the AB Dor Moving Group and the Pleiades cluster, and concluded that they were in close proximity 119 ¬± 20 Myr ago. The similarity of this kinematic age with the modern age of the Pleiades determined from the Lithium-depletion boundary method (130 ¬± 20 Myr), led these investigators to conclude that AB Dor Moving Group and Pleiades likely formed around the same time in the same star-forming complex. Recently, a color-magnitude analysis of the low-mass stars in the group by Barenfeld et al. (2013) found that the members of spectral type K6 and hotter appeared to be on the main sequence, whereas the cooler M-type stars are pre-main sequence - consistent with a lower limit on the age of the AB Dor Moving Group of >110 Myr. The latter study also concluded that some members of the moving group outside of the nucleus do not share a common chemical composition, implying that they are unrelated interlopers. Substellar members Bowler et al. (2012) discovered a ~30 Jupiter mass L0-type companion to the AB Dor Moving Group member 1RXS J235133.3+312720. In 2012, a group of astronomers announced the discovery of CFBDSIR 2149‚àí0403, a purported \\"free-floating planet\\" between 4 and 7 times the mass of Jupiter that appeared to be part of the moving group. At the time of its discovery, it was the closest known rogue planet; there are a few other previously detected objects which might also be rogue planets, but astronomers are uncertain as to whether they are planets or brown dwarfs because their ages are unknown. These previous discoveries were discussed in the research paper in which CFBDSIR 2149-0403 was announced. At this time, however, there is no evidence that CFBDSIR 2149‚àí0403 formed like a planet, and its status as a low-mass brown dwarf appears to be uncontroversial. In 2014, exoplanet GU Piscium b was discovered orbiting GU Piscium at a distance of 2000 AU and period of 80,000 years.

It is sometimes referred to as fibreball weed. The marine plant forms large meadows that are considered to be of high importance to the environmental conservation of the region. Balls of decomposing detritus from the foliage of the plant are found along nearby shore-lines. Description A flowering plant occurring in dense meadows, or along channels, in white sand. It is found at depths from 1 metre to 15 metres. Subsurface rhizomes and roots provide stability in the sands it occupies, erect rhizomes and leaves reduce the accumulation of silt. The leaves are ribbon-like and between 11 and 20 mm wide. They are bright green, perhaps becoming browned with age. The terminus of the leaf is rounded or absent through damage. They arranged in groups with older leaves on the outside, longer and differing in form from the younger leaves they surround. The species is monoecious. The flowers appear on small spikes on leafless stems, two bracts are found on each spike. The plant pollinates by hydrophily, by dispersing in the water. The reproduction of P. australis occurs usually through sexual or asexual methods but, under extreme conditions, by pseudovivipary method.Elizabeth Sinclair. What happens when (plant) sex fails? Atlas of Science, 2016 Recent research has shown that Posidonia australis can sequester carbon 35 times more efficiently than rainforests. Distribution This species is found in waters around the southern coast of Australia. In Western Australia is occurs in the Shark Bay region, around islands of the Houtman Abrolhos, and southward along the coast of the Swan Coastal Plain. The species is recorded at the edge of the Esperance Plains, the Archipelago of the Recherche, at the southern coast of the southwest region. The range extends to the east to coastal areas of New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. A sign of a nearby occurrence of Posidonia is the presence of masses of decomposing leaves on beaches, these form fibrous balls. Taxonomy This species is a member of the family Posidoniaceae, one of eight occurring in Australia. The ninth member, Posidonia oceanica, is found in the Mediterranean sea. The binomial for this species, Posidonia , is given for the god of the seas Poseidon, and australis refers to the southern distribution.

He went on to make nine league appearances for the club before he was sold to Cardiff City in August 1964 as manager Jimmy Scoular's first signing for a fee of ¬£2,000. In his first season at the club he helped the side to win the Welsh Cup and reach the quarter- finals of the European Cup Winners Cup, where they were knocked out by Real Zaragoza. The following season the club reached the semi-finals of the League Cup against West Ham United. Wilson was dropped after conceding five goals in the first leg, only for his replacement to also concede five in the second leg. It was during this season that Wilson helped the club to reach the semi- final of the Cup Winners Cup; the furthest Cardiff have ever been in a European competition, where they were defeated by Hamburg. Despite constant pressure from Dilwyn John and Lyn Davies he managed to hold on to the number one spot for the majority of his stay at the club.

History  The station was opened on 3 October 1862 by the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939 and may have had a coach visiting in 1934. The station closed along with the line on 5 May 1969. At 8 miles 17 chains (13.22 km) from King's Lynn, Dersingham marked the half-way point of the Hunstanton line. It was situated in possibly the most attractive section of the route where the line ran through extensive woodlands, between pine trees and rhododendrons, with the sea visible on the left. Architecturally, the station resembles North Wootton station, with a small main station building on the up platform and a small waiting room provided on the down platform; both had Great Eastern‚Äìstyle canopies. A small goods yard adjoined the main station building, and a standard Great Eastern gabled signal box was sited on the southern end of the down platform. A level crossing lay at the northern end of the station and, in common with other stations on the line, convenient lodging accommodation, a solidly built Carstone inn known as \\"The Alexandra Hotel\\", was to be found opposite the station approach.Jenkins, S.C., op. cit. p. 93.  Present day  The station buildings, including canopies, signal box and both platforms, have largely survived the station's closure in 1969.

The series is mainly set in Ireland. The leading characters are teenagers with the power to shapeshift (or \\"Switch\\") into the forms of animals and various supernatural creatures. Major characters * Tess: An only child who lives with her parents in Dublin city. Tess is thirteen at the beginning of the first book, and the final book deals with the events which precede her fifteenth birthday, concluding with her turning fifteen. Tess is a Switcher (shapeshifter), as well as being the principal protagonist of the series. She is initially reluctant to accept the existence of the supernatural world which her powers make open to her, and her rather narrow view of the world limits the array of forms which she can take. However, as the books progress, she becomes increasingly open-minded, and her range expands greatly. Throughout the series, Tess struggles with the choice of what to become when she makes her final, irreversible Switch on her fifteenth birthday. * Kevin: Another Switcher. When he discovered his ability to Switch, Kevin used the animal world as a means of escape from his unfulfilling human life, eventually deciding to leave behind humanity altogether. In Switchers, he appears as a shabbily dressed teenager living on the streets. He assumes the form of a phoenix at the end of this book- albeit out of necessity; he had been hit by a missile while in the form of a dragon and a phoenix was the only form he could think of to save his life-, but Tess finds a way to transform him back into a human at the end of Midnight's Choice, Kevin subsequently coming to accept his human status. * Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Larten: A widowed woman living alone in a semi-rural part of Dublin. Lizzie was once a Switcher herself, but evidently chose to remain human by the time she lost the gift on her fifteenth birthday. She owns many cats, uses atrocious grammar, and is rather eccentric in her views. She acts as Tess's confidante and adviser in matters relating to Tess's powers as a Switcher. =The Switching Power= The term \\"Switching\\" is used in the series as a euphemism for shapeshifting. Most of the series' main characters either possess this gift or did at one point, and are referred to as \\"Switchers\\". The power is not limited to creatures of the current age or of the natural world, and can be used to assume the form of animals long-since extinct or of supernatural creatures. However, unless the Switcher is aware of their power's potential as such, these fantastical dimensions of the gift remain untapped. At sunrise on their fifteenth birthday, all Switchers lose their power, and are forever bound to the form in which they exist at that moment. No explanation is ever given for this phenomenon. Toward the end of the first book, Lizzie reveals that all children are born with the ability to Switch, but that unless they discover it before they turn eight (the age at which their minds begin to conform to the ideas presented by others) it remains dormant within them and never surfaces again. Therefore, very few children ever learn to use the power. In Wild Blood, the final book of the series, the Switching power is revealed to originate from interbreeding between humans and members of the Tuatha D√© Danann, who were well known for their shapeshifting abilities. This book also reveals that Switchers can choose to become like their fairy ancestors, and so retain their gift beyond their fifteenth birthday, but such a transformation permanently cuts them off from the human world. Books =Switchers= A lonely teenage girl named Tess finds solace in using her ability to 'Switch' to explore the animal world. When she meets Kevin, another Switcher, he reveals to her that an enormously powerful force is threatening to usher in a new Ice Age. Kevin and Tess alone have the power to stop this terrible threat. Before she knows what is happening, Tess finds herself leaving behind her comfortable home and her parents to journey with Kevin to the Arctic circle, where they must face the fearsome and ancient krools. =Midnight's Choice= With Kevin happily settled into the form of a phoenix, Tess turns her attention to helping a depressed fellow Switcher named Martin to choose his path when he turns fifteen. But Martin's habits of Switching are unconventional, for he has taken refuge from his grief and loneliness in the cold, dark persona of a vampire. Soon Tess is in a race against time to save Martin, and herself, from the darkness of the vampire world. =Wild Blood= Tess' fifteenth birthday looms ahead, the day when she must soon decide on one, permanent form which she will wear for the rest of her life. Her choice is not made any easier when her parents send her to stay with her cousins in Clare during her birthday. While at her cousins' house, Tess discovers that there is something strange and frightening lurking in the nearby woods, beckoning her to join it in its otherworldly domain. Major themes The primary focus of the series is the idea of \\"coming of age\\", and the possibilities with which teenagers are faced in the modern world. This theme recurs throughout many of Kate Thompson's books. The series also deals with various mythological creatures such as vampires, phoenixes and fairies, as well as shapeshifters (referred to as 'Switchers' in the books). The idea of choice is another a central theme of the series. Another theme that could be read between the lines, but is stated at the end of the third book, is that the world is in danger and the new generation needs to protect the planet. Publication history Switchers, the first book of the trilogy, was originally published in Ireland by the Aran Press in 1994, and was republished in Great Britain by The Bodley Head in 1997. Midnight's Choice and Wild Blood followed in 1998 and 1999, also published by The Bodley Head. The three books were published in one volume by Random House in 2004.

Mackenzie and Alexanderina Mackenzie, and as a child moved with his parents to Birmingham where his father worked for many years. He attended King Edward's School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Upon obtaining his BA and completion of his Indian Civil Service exans, Mackenzie joined the Bengal Civil Service and went to Calcutta in 1862. Early career Mackenzie subsequently held a number of civil service appointments in the Bengal Presidency and British India. He was Secretary to the Bengali Government from 1877, and made a name for himself by compiling a history of the relations of the government with tribes on the north-east frontier of Bengal. In 1882 he was appointed Secretary in the Home Department of the Government of India. Five years later he received a senior colonial appointment as Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces in 1887, and in December 1890 transferred to become Chief Commissioner of British Burma, where he stayed until 1895. The same year he was appointed a Member of the Council of the Governor General of India. In 1891 he became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI). Bengal After his service in Burma, he was in December 1895 appointed Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, where he served for three years. His short term in office was dominated by natural disasters, the province suffered plague, famine, earthquake and cyclone in those years. As an administrator he was a stern upholder of the rights of the province against what he perceived to be the financial encroachments of the British Indian government, and voiced this in the council, receiving opposition from the financial member of the council Sir James Westland. He cooperated with the Assam Administration in the conduct of the Lushai expedition in 1895-96. In local administration, he initiated a survey and settlement in Orissa, took a keen interest in education and in the improvement of the Calcutta docks. He was probably mostly remembered for his work with the Calcutta Corporation to reform the Calcutta Municipal Act after a sanitary survey of the city found very unsatisfying conditions. His aloof ways in dealings with the city and corporation led to enmity with the Indian population and press. His absence and negligence during his time in office made him unpopular amongst locals, but did not results in his removal from office. Poor health led him to take six months leave from May 1897. He was back in Bengal by the end of the year, but was forced to retire permanently in March 1898 due to poor health. He returned to the United Kingdom and led a quite life, his only significant public office was as Chairman of the India Development Company. He died at Radnor, Holmbury St Mary, Surrey, on 10 November 1902. Family Mackenzie was twice married. His first wife from 1863 was Georgina Louisa Huntly Bremner (born 1838 India,FIBIS East India Register Birth Announcements, April 2009. and died 1892 Birmingham), youngest daughter of Colonel Bremner; and after her death he remarried as second wife in 1893 Mabel Elizabeth Elliot, youngest daughter of Ralph Elliot (1839‚Äì1874) and a granddaughter of Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet.

It is approximately north of Winnipeg, the provincial capital of Manitoba, Canada. Its land area is 20.279 km¬≤ (7.83 sq mi), making it the smallest rural municipality in Manitoba. It is slightly less than half the size of the next-smallest Rural Municipality of East St. Paul. It lies on a small peninsula that extends into Lake Winnipeg, and is almost completely surrounded by the lake, but does share a small southern land border with the Rural Municipality of Alexander. Elk Island Provincial Park lies on an island in the north end of the municipality. The Rural Municipality (R.M.) of Victoria Beach is a so-called \\"resort municipality\\". Some of the finest beaches in Manitoba are located within the boundaries of the municipality. , Victoria Beach has a permanent population of 450 residents, but during the summer vacation season the population swells to about 16,000 people. Unlike other resort areas, (such as Grand Beach) the municipality has no campgrounds, picnic areas or tourist attractions. The community is operated by The Rural Municipality of Victoria Beach for the purpose of providing permanent residents and cottagers with a relaxed, private, enjoyable atmosphere, without excessive public traffic and commercialization. Victoria Beach today Victoria Beach with its restricted area is one of the more exclusive places to own a cottage, with its own sailing club, marina with dock, baseball field, tennis courts and golf course. With several small beaches the cottages vary from large and modern to small, almost historic cabins. Victoria Beach used to be an island in the estuary of the Winnipeg River, until it was connected to the mainland by the railroad dam. The restricted area and its gravel laneways are dominated by pedestrians and cyclists during the summer months. From the week before Canada Day until Labour Day, most motor vehicles are banned and must be parked within the Victoria Beach Parking Lot (VBPL) which is a private enterprise located at the main entrance to the community. Exceptions for motor vehicle access are afforded to delivery vehicles, contractors performing work, VBPL taxi service vehicles or other vehicles with compelling reasons for entry. These exceptions require drivers to adhere to strict speed limits while yielding to pedestrians and cyclists to maintain a safe and peaceful resort environment. Victoria Beach hosts one of Manitoba's largest catamaran sailing fleets, as well as other dinghies and a small number of keelboats. Located on the east side of Lake Winnipeg near the town of Victoria Beach, the Yacht Club offers both recreation and racing fun. History =√éle-√†-la-Biche= The first white people, the Voyageurs, to travel Lake Winnipeg knew what is now the peninsula of Victoria Beach as L'√éle-√†-la-Biche. What is now the remains of the old railway dam were portaged as a shortcut from the Winnipeg River Estuary to Lake Winnipeg. =Founding= In April 1910 the Victoria Beach Investment Company was founded by C.W.N. Kennedy, having a President and 4 Directors. The aim of the Company was to \\" lay out, improve, sell and dispose of its lands to be used primarily as a summer resort.\\" Any person desirous of running a business had to get the approval of the VB Company. In 1913, the assets of the Victoria Beach Investment Company were sold to the Victoria Beach Company. The new owners upheld the original goals, and continued to acquire land in the area. By 1915, the company had gained control of the land that now comprises the municipality. In the following years, the company sold numerous lots, and many campers had begun to construct cottages. =Incorporation= On August 6, 1919, after negotiations with the province, the Municipality of Victoria Beach was incorporated. Because Victoria Beach was basically an island with only a narrow spit joining it to the mainland, there was no road access but in 1916 the railway was to arrive at Victoria Beach making it easier to bring in supplies to build cottages. After the war it was a constant desire of cottagers to have a road built to join Albert Beach to the rest of Victoria Beach and 1952 saw the completion of this road. By 1962 most people were arriving by car to their cabins and the railway was no longer required. In 1921 the Victoria Beach Community Club was organized and in 1925 the Clubhouse was built which exists to this day. The Clubhouse was home to weekend dances and social events and is now the hub of summer activity for under 18'ers. = Golf course and tennis court = A golf course was built in 1923 and a tennis court in 1924. Both amenities exist to this day with the tennis court now being close to the General Store. Einfeld Bakery was started in the 1930s and is still a viable operation to this day and still being run by the original family. Einfeld's Bakery is so well known that the Coast Guard have been known to boat over from Gimli in inclement weather just for dream cookies. = Victoria Beach News = On June 15, 1926 the Victoria Beach News started publishing. Today it is run by Nancy and Reg Johnson under the name of the Victoria Beach Herald, now published only in the summer months. Because the area was mainly a summer resort, those who lived here full-time had to be hardy outdoors people who relied on industries such as commercial fishing, trucking and the lumber industry in the off season. There were many mink ranches in Victoria Beach and Victoria Beach mink became unique and popular but with the advent of man-made materials which were lighter and the wearing of animal skins becoming distasteful, the last mink ranch pelted out in March 2003, marking the end of an era. = Royal Canadian Legion and Memorial Community Club = 1935 gave rise to both the Royal Canadian Legion and the Alex Anderson Memorial Community Club The Community Club is now a skating rink, curling club and social hall. Other amenities of the area include a marina, swimming docks for swimming lessons, a sailing club, Moonlight Inn Restaurant, a library, children's playground and 12 of the best beaches in North America sporting very fine and soft white sand. Baseball was very popular and Victoria Beach teams were hugely successful in tournaments throughout the summer. = Hydro Service = 1954 saw Manitoba Hydro service provided to the permanent residents and in 1956 hydro was extended for use by the cottage community.

The abbey is famous for its spiritual life and its brewery, which is one of few Trappist beer breweries in the world. Life in the abbey is characterised by prayer, reading and manual work, the three basic elements of Trappist life. The motto of the abbey is Curvata Resurgo. History =Early history= Around 1230, Gilles de Walcourt, count of Rochefort founded a monastery for Cistercian nuns called Secours de Notre-Dame. In 1464 Louis de la Marck ordered the nuns to leave the monastery which had decayed and they were replaced by monks. The monastery was the latest Daughter-house of the abbey of Abbey of C√Æteaux. During the Eighty Years War the abbey was ravaged by the Protestant armies of the Seventeen Provinces (1568) and the Austrian armies of John of Austria (1577). Around 1595, the first brewery was founded within the abbey. In the 17th century the abbey suffered from war, famine and the plague. On 30 April 1650, an army from Lorraine, led by baron Ch√¢telet, invaded the abbey. The monks had to flee to Marche, as well as in 1652 and 1653. In 1789 the French revolutionary army invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and in 1797 the abbey was closed and sold to Lucien-Joseph Poncelet. Poncelet demolished the abbey around 1805 and converted it to a farm. Material of the abbey was used for buildings in Rochefort. =Modern history= On 11 October 1887, father Anselmus Judong from the Trappist Abbey of Achel came to the old abbey and on 21 December 1887 the buildings were bought by the monks of Achel. The abbey was restored and new buildings were raised. A new brewery was founded, but it would take until 1952 for the brewery to produce enough beer to be sold. Brewing is the main source of income for the monastery since the 16th century. The brewery was renovated in 1952 and produces high fermentation beer. The Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance is known for their seclusion and the brewery is not accessible to the public. On 29 December 2010 a large fire destroyed a large part of the abbey. Though the blaze has destroyed much of the building's timber structure, the monks escaped unharmed and the flames did not damage the beer producing facilities. References Sources * A.

In the mid-19th century a paper mill was established in Loudwater using new technology developed by George Tidcombe. The mill was still standing in 2008. The present estate was built over approximately 20 years from 1939 on plots from the grounds of Loudwater House (see below) and now is a conservation area. There are approximately 450 dwellings, and there is no pub, shop or community focus, but there is a residents' association. In 2002, nearly a quarter of the residents were millionaires, the highest concentration of any community in the United Kingdom. The average house price in April 2020 was ¬£1,620,296. the Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire is Robert Voss CBE, a resident of Loudwater with his wife Celia.

Using her own childhood for inspiration, Rayburn came up with the image of a girl in a store trying to decide which candy she should buy. After she completed the assignment Rayburn continued to work on the novel for her own enjoyment and eventually finished a first draft, which became her MFA thesis. Having not considered it before, Rayburn was struck by a sudden thought during a meeting with her MFA adviser and asked whether she should seek publication. She sent out several query letters to agents, without expecting a result, and received her first reply two days later.Kelly, \\"Friday Fifteen: Tricia Rayburn,\\" One Book Two Book (January 11, 2008). Rayburn signed with the Writers House agency and began to revise the novel with the help of her agent, Rebecca Sherman. Until this time, the character of Maggie Bean had been called Lucy Moon, but Rayburn had to change it because someone else was already using the name in their novel. Once this and other changes had been made, the novel was sent out to editors; it was accepted by Simon & Schuster and published as one of the six launch titles for their new Aladdin MIX imprint.Joy Bean, \\"S&S; Reaches Out to Tweens,\\" Publishers Weekly (5/10/2007).

Eddie Locke was a part of the fertile and vibrant Detroit jazz scene during the 1940s and 1950s, which brought forth many great musicians including the Jones brothers (Hank, Thad, and Elvin), Kenny Burrell, Lucky Thompson, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris, and so many others. He eventually formed a variety act with drummer Oliver Jackson called Bop & Locke which played the Apollo Theater. He moved to New York City in 1954, and worked there with Dick Wellstood, Tony Parenti, Red Allen, Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, and Teddy Wilson amongst others. During this time he came under the tutelage of the great Jo Jones, and eventually became known as a driving and swinging drummer who kept solid time and supported the soloist. During the late 1950s he formed two of his most fruitful musical relationships, one with Roy Eldridge, and the other with Coleman Hawkins. His recording debut came with Eldridge in 1959 on \\"On The Town\\". He later became a member of the Coleman Hawkins Quartet in the 1960s along with pianist Tommy Flanagan and bassist Major Holley. That group made many fine records including the exquisite album \\"Today and Now\\", in 1963. Throughout the 1970s, he played with Roy Eldridge at Jimmy Ryan's in Manhattan, and wound out his career freelancing, as well as teaching youngsters at the Trevor Day School on Manhattan's upper west side.

The maintenance hangar and a small weather observatory building were built in 1928. Civilian Conservation Corps funds helped to bring in large quantities of gravel to stabilize the landing area in the early 1930s. Originally the airport was only a north-south dirt strip. A crosswind runway was added in the 1930s. A small amount of paving was added to the south end of the original strip in the 1950s to accommodate drag racing by automobiles, not aircraft. During World War II, the airport was designated as Montague Air Force Auxiliary Field, and was an auxiliary training airfield for Hamilton Field, California. The airport returned to civil control in 1945 after the war. The last major improvement consisted of lengthening the runway by 600 feet to its present 3,360 feet in 1982.

His pulp industry observations were published in hardback as Pulpwood Editor (1937). Early life He was born on April 11, 1893, in Montana to Augustine Haynes \\"Doc\\" Hersey, a newspaper reporter and publisher. The family moved to Washington, D.C., in the late 1890s. While Mrs. Hersey and two daughters stayed at home, Doc took Harold with him on globe-trotting reportorial assignments. They visited many places in North America. In 1904‚Äì05, they traveled to the Far East for the Russo-Japanese War. The pair traveled extensively in eastern Asia. Doc died in D.C. in 1907, leaving Harold with his mother and sisters.Locke, John. \\"Harold Hersey: Tales of an Ink-Stained Wretch\\", a comprehensive Hersey biography, included in City of Numbered Men: The Best of Prison Stories (2010). Harold worked at the Library of Congress for eight years while getting a degree from George Washington University at night. About 1914, he married Merle Williams; they had one child, a daughter Dorothy, Harold Hersey's only offspring. The marriage was brief. (Merle W. Hersey later moved to New York and edited a succession of sex-oriented \\"girly pulps\\" from about 1925‚Äì36.) Harold Hersey moved to Greenwich Village, New York, and helped Margaret Sanger launch her journal Birth Control Review. He met Fulton Oursler. In 1917, Hersey teamed up with Arthur Moss to publish The Quill, a literary and satire magazine. He corresponded with T. Atkinson Jenkins, and Ezra Pound. He was secretary to the Author's League, and supported Theodore Dreiser in his Genius censorship fight. He visited author Henry Leverage in Sing Sing. Mid life During World War I, he was a lieutenant in public relations, but never went overseas. Several articles on military matters were published in Scribner's. He was editor of Minaret magazine in Washington, D. C., with Shaemus O. Sheele, and Herbert Bruncken. He got his first commercial publishing job with publisher Street & Smith in 1919 editing the legendary pulp The Thrill Book. Hersey was fired (or resigned) after 8 of the 16 issues. It's often cited as the first all-fantasy pulp, but in actuality it blended straight drama, adventure, sea stories, mysteries, etc., while also featuring a bit of fantasy. After leaving Street & Smith, Hersey immediately joined new pulp publisher, Clayton Publications in 1919, as a title editor, feature writer and later group editor for several of the Clayton magazines. Hersey is credited with creating Ranch Romances, the first western-romance hybrid. Ranch Romances was one of the last pulps to cease publication, lasting into the early '70s. Magazine publishers After Clayton, Hersey had stints working for Bernarr Macfadden, briefly replacing Fulton Oursler as Supervising Editor of the Macfadden magazines (1927), and the Eastern Distributing Company. In late 1928, Hersey with money fronted by a distributor started his own pulp chain, Magazine Publishers, also known as The Hersey Magazines. The covers sported an ancient Indian good luck symbol...a swastika-logo. Titles included The Dragnet Magazine, Sky Birds, Fire Fighters, and The Underworld Magazine. Some unknown disagreement with his co- founders/backers resulted in Hersey leaving the company in mid-1929. Magazine Publishers, with former Dell editor Aron Wyn at the helm, turned into the chain known as the Ace Group. Good Story Magazine Company Hersey founded another pulp chain, Good Story Magazine Company, with financial backing from Macfadden. Good Story's Gangster Stories was an immediate hit. Within a few months, a dozen titles had been issued, including some now-rare one-shots like Thrills of the Jungle and Love and War Stories. With the issue of February 1930, another gang pulp, Racketeer Stories, was introduced. The violence and lawlessness of the two gang pulps provoked outrage. Hersey was threatened with prosecution in the state of New York. The crisis passed, and the gang pulps remained the mainstay of Hersey's chain into 1932.Locke, John. \\"Glorifying the American Goon,\\" introduction to Gang Pulp (Off-Trail Publications, 2008). Other Good Story pulps include Prison Stories, Murder Stories, and Miracle, Science and Fantasy Stories. Hersey bought the company outright in late 1931, after Macfadden withdrew financing. Hersey went forward as an independent. From then on, the pulps were published by Headquarters, Blue Band, and other imprints. However, the company failed in 1932 and Hersey sold his holdings.Locke, John. \\"Harold Hersey: Tales of an Ink-Stained Wretch,\\" included in City of Numbered Men: The Best of Prison Stories (2010). Throughout the '30s, Hersey continued to test the market with new magazines.

Bhatkhande gives the pakad as Dha Ga , Ga Ga, , Sa. Patwardan has shown the mukhya ang as Ga Dha, Dha Ga , but points out that the raga is also clearly indicated by: 'Ni Ga Dha, Dha Ga 'Ni Sa.Bagchee p. 318 The chalan given by Ruckert is: 'Ni 'Dha 'Ni 'Dha 'Ni 'Dha 'Ni 'Dha Sa Ga Dha Ni Dha Ga Sa 'Ni 'Dha Sa Bagchee p.318  Organisation & Relationships  Thaat: MarwaJairazbhoy(1995)).

As the sixth is emphasised while the tonic is omitted it may feel like playing in A Major, while the base tone is C (not C sharp). If the musician turns back to Sa at the end of a phrase it always comes like a surprise note.  Behaviour  Ni is not a leading note to Sa.

Marwa is also characterised as quiet, contemplative, representing gentle love.

Historical Information Marwa's forerunners (Maru or Maruva) have different scales in the literature from the 16th century onwards.

Jean-Francois's mother owned sizable sugar cane plantations and came from an old naval family named Duquesne; her direct ancestry included captain-armator Abraham Duquesne (1570‚Äì1635) and admiral Abraham Duquesne-Guitton (1651‚Äì1724). The title of Prevost de Sansac de Traversay traces back to chevallier Hugh Prevost (d. 1086). Jean-Baptiste was five years old when he arrived in France in 1759. His father first placed him in a Benedictine boarding school in Sor√®ze. In 1766 Jean-Baptiste joined the Navy college in Rochefort; when this college was closed, his class continued their training in Brest. Traversay was commissioned an enseigne de vaisseau in 1773 and spent three years sailing on transport ships to and from the Caribbean islands. After a brief stay in Rochefort, where he joined the Free Masons and temporarily commanded a company of marines protecting the coast from British incursions, Traversay was assigned to the fleet of admiral d'Orvilliers. =American Revolutionary War= In May 1778, when France and the United States signed the Treaty of Alliance, war with Britain became imminent. On 15 June 1778, Traversay joined the crew of Vengeur, a 64-gun ship of the line under the command of captain Guy de Kersaint. On 8 July, the French fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean with orders to engage and destroy the British Navy and cooperate with American insurgents. Soon Traversay saw his first actual combat in the Battle of Ushant, a minor victory for the French. Vengeur managed to capture the British privateer St. Peter, and Traversay delivered the prize back to Rochefort. Two weeks later, he sailed to the Antilles again, this time as first officer of the frigate Iphig√©nie, under the command of Armand de Kersaint, which joined the fleet of admiral d'Estaing. On 14 December 1778, Iphig√©nie captured , a new 18-gun British corvette; the French Navy took her in service as C√©r√®s. C√©r√®s became Traversay's first command. In the next year C√©r√®s became a lucky bounty hunter, seizing numerous British transports. In September 1779, C√©r√®s was in action in an abortive landing at Savannah, in April and May 1780 in the Battle of Martinique, and in two subsequent clashes between the fleets of admirals d'Estaing and Rodney. In March 1781 Traversay assumed command of Aigrette, a fast 26-gun frigate assigned to the fleet of admiral de Grasse. Aigrettes tasks in this campaign ranged from screening Rodney's movements to running shipments of gold from Havana (Spain was subsidizing the French campaign in West Indies). On 30 August 1781 the French fleet arrived at Chesapeake Bay. French troops disembarked to encircle the British force of general Corwallis. Aigrette, stationed at Cape Henry, seized two sloops, a brig, and a 20-gun corvette. In the morning of 5 September, Aigrette was the first French ship to detect the approaching fleet of admiral Graves. The subsequent Battle of the Chesapeake was a strategic defeat for the British. Soon after the battle, Aigrette seized HMS Iris, a 34-gun frigate (originally the USS Hancock, which the British had captured in 1777). Traversay assumed command of Iris, leaving Aigrette in the hands of her first officer. In the last months of the war Iris took part in the Battle of St. Kitts. On the eve of Battle of the Saintes, de Grasse detached Iris to convoy unarmed troop transports. Iris completed her mission while the main French force suffered a humiliating defeat. In the late stages of war Iris continued reconnaissance, bounty hunting, and finally performed a diplomatic mission, bringing an offer of a ceasefire to British- occupied New York. Traversay was honored with the French Order of Saint Louis (awarded before the defeat at the Saintes), and a membership in the American Society of the Cincinnati. He became captain of the first rank in 1786, at the age of only 32. =Russian Baltic Fleet= At the outbreak of French Revolution Traversay was stationed in his home Martinique as captain of . When news of the fall of the Bastille reached the island, local French troops revolted and were repatriated to Lorient on Traversay's Active. Back in France, the French Navy was falling apart too; Traversay took a long leave, sending his family to a safe place in Switzerland. In 1790 empress Catherine, fearing a Swedish-British alliance, transferred officers of English descent to the Black Sea fleet, creating a void in the Baltic Fleet. In 1791 Traversay received an invitation to enter Russian service, signed by an √©migr√© Frenchman - admiral Nassau-Siegen;Karl Heinrich Otto, prince Nassau-Siegen, was a Frenchman by blood and a French subject. He belonged to the Dutch branch of Nassau that adhered to Catholic faith. king Louis XVI approved the move, and in spring of 1791 Traversay arrived in Saint Petersburg. He was created major general and rear admiral of Russian Empire, and placed in command of a galley flotilla, subordinate to Nassau-Siegen. This commission did not last long, due to strong anti-French feelings among Russians committed to following the model of the British Royal Navy. By summer 1791 Britain was not seen as an imminent enemy anymore and the Englishmen returned to Saint Petersburg. Nassau-Siegen and Traversay became unwanted guests; in August 1791, Traversay left Russia for Coblenz, to serve as liaison between Catherine and the Army of Cond√©. After two years with the √©migr√©e forces, in July 1793 he returned to Russia with his family. In 1795 Traversay was appointed commander of a flotilla based in Rochensalm (present-day Kotka in Finland); from 1797 he was also the military governor of Rochensalm, responsible for building and managing this naval fortress, recently annexed from Sweden. Emperor Paul I valued Traversay's service, and, unlike many contemporary soldiers, Traversay enjoyed Paul's good disposition throughout his short reign. Paul's successor, Alexander I, too valued Traversay. =Black Sea Fleet= In 1802, Alexander promoted Traversay to full admiral and appointed him commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet and the governor of Kherson Oblast. Eventually, Traversay got rid of the civil assignment, but retained authority over the naval bases of Nikolaev and Sebastopol. The combat core of Black Sea fleet, under admirals Ushakov and Senyavin, was based in Mediterranean island of Corfu, and Traversay's role was restricted to administering emerging naval bases and supplying the Corfu fleet. These two functions conflicted with each other; funds allocated for bases in Russia were consumed by the Corfu fleet and the bills of the fledgling Septinsular Republic. Traversay's only combat operation of this period, the last in his life, was the siege and destruction of Anapa in April 1807 (see Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812)). A force of four ships-of- the-line (all that was left n home waters), under the command of admiral Pustoshkin, with Traversay on board, fired on the rebel fortress at point- blank range. After the rebels abandoned Anapa without fighting, Russian infantry razed the fortress to the ground. A second similar operation, against Trabzon, was detected early by the Turks and was cancelled before the first shots could be fired. In July 1809 Traversay received orders to transfer command of the Black Sea fleet to Duc de Richelieu and admiral Yazykov, and to return to Saint Petersburg as soon as possible to replace Minister of the Navy, admiral Pavel Chichagov. =Minister of Russian Navy= Between 1809 and 1812, Traversay's main tasks were improving shipbuilding and coastal defences in the Baltic Sea. He reorganized the Baltic fleet structure (over 32 000 men), creating the system of permanent regiment-sized units (fleet crews, ) that supplied manpower to ships and ground forces. This system proved itself during the War of 1812 and subsequent campaigns against Napoleon, and survived until the fall of the House of Romanov. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Russian economy was in ruins. Consequently, Alexander had to cut the Navy budget to the point where the Baltic fleet could not afford continuous exercises in open seas. Traversay had to limit fleet exercises to the shallow and narrow eastern extremity of the Gulf of Finland, sarcastically often called the Marquis Puddle. By 1817, the Navy budget had recovered and the Admiralty Shipyard managed to complete seven new frigates and two ships of the line. The Navy also resumed long-range operations, still, the sobriquet Marquis Puddle persisted for nearly two centuries. In 1815-1821 Traversay sponsored long-range expeditions into the Arctic and Antarctic waters. The first (1815‚Äì1818), led by Otto von Kotzebue, explored Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka to Sandwich Islands. The second (1819‚Äì1821), led by Lazarev and Bellingshausen, circumnavigated the Antarctic coast, discovering and naming the Traversay Islands on the way. The third, also launched in 1819, led by Anjou, Shishmaryov, and Wrangel, traversed the Bering Strait and explored the Arctic coastline of Alaska and Russia, reaching 76¬∞ 15‚Ä≤N. Traversay was offered a share in the Russian-American Company, which benefited from these expeditions, but refused, citing conflict of interest. He also declined the title of prince (knyaz) of the Russian Empire, believing that the rare title of marquis will be better for his offspring. In 1821, after the death of his second wife, the aging Traversay tried to resign for the first time. Tsar Alexander did not let him go; instead, he honored Traversay with the Order of St. Andrew. Alexander also allowed Traversay to move from the city to his country home in Romanshchina (near Luga, 120 kilometers from Saint Petersburg), and to run the Navy operations from there. For the next 7 years, the Navy Ministry operated far away from any naval base. The tsar himself regularly visited Traversay in his country office, with the last meeting in Romanshchina occurring in September 1825, four weeks before Alexander's death at Taganrog. At about the same time Traversay suffered his first ischemia seizures. During the first three years of the reign of Nicholas I, Traversay continued rebuilding the Baltic fleet after the disastrous flood of 1824, gradually passing his duties to younger officers. In 1828 Traversay finally retired, with an honorary award of Order of St. George, 4th class. He died in Romanschina in 1831. =Private life= Traversay married his first wife, Marie Madeleine, daughter of admiral Jean-Joseph de Riouffe, in Rochefort in 1783. Two of their children born in France and Switzerland, Claire (1785‚Äì1842) and Jean-Francois (future Alexander Ivanovich de Traversay, Sr.), lived long enough to acquire Russian citizenship. Marie Madeleine died while giving birth in 1796 but the newborn boy, Alexander, survived. Alexander's godmother in his orthodox baptism, the empress Catherine, generously awarded the baby with a naval officer's commission. Traversay, however, feared that the newborn would perish, too, and asked the empress to transfer her gift to Jean-Francois, who was renamed Alexander to retain the commission. Baby Alexander survived as well, so the family had two Alexanders: Alexander Sr. (1791‚Äì1850) and Alexander Jr. (1796‚Äì1866). Both eventually joined the Russian Navy. Four years later, Traversay married Louise Ulrica de Bruine (Loviisa Ulriikka Bruun), herself 27 years younger than her new husband. She was the daughter of Elisabeth Fabritius and her husband burgher Kaarle Bruun, a rich merchant and businessman in Hamina, Old Finland. he owned Oravala manor of Valkeala,the nearest chartered town to Traversay command, the fortification on the Kymi River. This marriage produced two children - Fyodor = Frederic (b. 1803, a civil servant in the Navy), and Marie (1807‚Äì1871). Louise Ulrica died in 1821. Later, Louise Ulrica's nephew Theodor Bruun became the Minister State Secretary of Finland and was created a baron. Traversay accepted Russian citizenship in 1811, when he registered as a resident landlord of Voronezh governorate. He, however, remained a Roman Catholic and spoke Russian poorly until his death. His children were baptised and raised in the Orthodox faith, and fully assimilated into Russian society of their period. Traversay's descendants live in France, Kiev, and Orsha (Belarus).

The line and its railway stations were opened on 27 October 1846 as far as Narborough. Middleton railway station opened with the line and was situated south-east of Lynn station and north-west of East Winch. While the line was still being built the Lynn & Dereham was taken over by the East Anglian Railway on 22 July 1847. The line reached Swaffham on 10 August 1847. The station was renamed from Middleton to Middleton Towers on 1 November 1924. After a large housing development was completed in Leziate in 1990, the line between Middleton Towers and King's Lynn was considered for restoration as a passenger route. With the electrification of the main line between Cambridge and King's Lynn the provision of rolling stock was a major issue. The railway between the station and King's Lynn remains in use as a goods line, and the station has been the destination of a number of charter trains. A sand loading silo has been constructed on the former main line to Swaffham east of the station.

She became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere won the race in 1983. She went on to win a second Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995. She has also trained two Cheltenham Gold Cup winners with Burrough Hill Lad in 1984 and with Garrison Savanah in 1991. Following her retirement from horse training in 1998 she became a writer of novels, principally with a racing theme. She is a member of the Disciplinary Panel and Licensing Committee of the British Horseracing Authority. Childhood Pitman was born as Jennifer Susan Harvey on her family's farm near Hoby, Leicestershire, one of seven children. She was brought up assisting in manual farm work, where horse powered equipment was a novelty, and learned to ride a pony \\"so young that being on horseback seemed as natural as walking\\". In 1957 she left the Hoby village school to attend Sarson Secondary Modern Girls' School in Melton Mowbray. She sustained a fractured skull when a showjumping pole fell on her head during a gymkhana at Syston, it was many months before resultant convulsions were diagnosed. At the age of 14, she obtained a weekend and school holiday job at Brooksby Grange horse racing yard. Pitman left school two weeks before her 15th birthday, taking up a position as a stable girl at Brooksby Grange for a weekly wage of ¬£3 4s 5d. Her first overnight stop was at Manchester where her filly, Star Princess, won the 1962 Diomedes Handicap. Two years later she changed jobs, moving to a stable in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, the first time she had lived away from her Leicestershire home. Adult life Pitman worked at Bishop's Cleeve for two years. One day there, she was returning from a workout on the local gallops when her horse was spooked by a cyclist travelling around a corner too fast and on the wrong side of the road. The cyclist in question was jockey Richard Pitman. Jenny's initial reaction to Richard was unfavourable, but later, when Richard obtained a job in Lambourn at Fred Winter's training stables from Bishop's Cleeve, Jenny was persuaded to apply for a job in Lambourn with Major Champneys at Church Farm Stables. She moved in 1964. Aged 19, she married Richard Pitman. In August 1966, their son Mark Pitman was born and Jenny became a full-time housewife. Son Paul was born in October 1967. In the next winter, missing the world of horses, they bought a property with stables and an indoor school in Hinton Parva to provide a service to other trainers for recuperating injured horses. In 'Parva Stud', the family struggled to live in an unheated caravan. By the end of 1968 Pitman had 8 horses at the yard. With Richard's second place prize from the 1969 Grand National, the Pitmans were able to commission a bungalow on the premises to escape the poor condition caravan. In 1969 she employed a 'lad' to assist at the yard, Melvyn Saddler, who became her right-hand man as her success grew. In February 1974, Pitman was able to enter a horse she had trained in her first point-to-point race. Ridden by stable lad Bryan Smart, Road Race didn't figure in the race betting, but amazingly managed to pass the favourite after the last fence to win. In 1975 she was successful in getting her first horse training licence and her first winner came in the very same year. In 1977 Jenny and Richard divorced. Jenny left Wiltshire and moved to Lambourn, Berkshire. She is now married to businessman David Stait. In 1983 she became the first woman to train a Grand National winner, when Corbiere was the victor.Grand National website She was to win one other Grand National with Royal Athlete in 1995 although her horse Esha Ness was first past the post in the void National of 1993.Grand National website, op cit.

When the aircraft's speed reaches zero and it stops climbing, the pilot maintains the aircraft in a stand-still position as long as possible (this is greatly helped by thrust vectoring on newer fighter aircraft), and as it starts to fall to the ground backward, tail first, the nose drops through the horizon to a vertical down position and the aircraft enters a dive. A 1/4 loop (push or pull) recovers to level flight. Tailslides will transiently reverse the airflow on many aircraft surfaces, giving abnormal forces compared with forward flight. The control surface linkages must be able to handle these forces without damage or deformation. Not all airplanes capable of aerobatics are also capable of tailslide maneuvers. \\"Bell\\" maneuver The bell is a variation of the tailslide maneuver, with the only difference being that the pilot performs a roll in the longitudinal axis during the final 1/4 loop (push or pull) while recovering to level flight, out of plane.
